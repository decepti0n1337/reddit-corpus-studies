The other three replies are getting close to the reason, but just missing the mark. You want to activate autoshot before every time you attack. You want an auto shot to be your first attack. The reason for this is because auto attacks are on a timer, and your spell shots can happen at any time. So, you pull with auto attack, then immediately cast a second shot (while moving) and that is a better DPS rotation than pulling with serpent sting (or any other spell). So, you want auto-shot on your bars so you can pull with an auto shot.

Here’s the scoop and I’m gonna tell ya... 
---

---
1. Gosh I hope not 
---
2. I’m going to take an educated guess and assume I’m not
---
3. I’ve spent a fair amount of IRL money on my toons over the years. More if you count realm and faction changes over the years to play with friends/family
---
Now, the actual scoop thing:
---
I played an orc warrior to 60 in 2015. I tanked ubrs 20/15/10, scholo 15/10. Live and Dead. I re-rolled to a paladin (lolret) in early 2016, and ended up RetShocking my way up to Twin Emps before my guild shattered on C’Thun. 
---
That paladin was started on launch day of a server called Altar of Storms. The first week I could barely login to play my toon due to population limits, let alone actually tag and kill ANYTHING even while grouped up with 4 randoms having the same problem. I still remember the frustration vividly. 
---
That’s why I’m pro-layering. Huzzah?
---
It's not that hard to get there solo as a mage. You can even solo the last boss as a mage without amazing gear.
---
I think you meant to type LF healer and tank lol
---
The numbers private servers get are nothing compared to the numbers Classic will get especially on launch. Like it or not layering is the only way to go for first few months until things start to slow down. This has been explained over and over again, you need to read up on it until you understand why this is a necessary solution.
---
If you don’t want layering, start playing in December.
---
Been playing from a few months after launch to I want to say a few months into MoP. Got my dragon, had my farm set up, started some new rep grind for something.... All I remember is that it unlocked the rep grind for ANOTHER faction and that was the last straw for me.
---
Personally I started with about 6 months left of vanilla and leveled a night elf hunter (classic) to 40 before switching to a night elf priest. I never really experienced the horde until I switched over in wotlk and I fell in love. I have mixed feelings about what I want to play. On one hand I love hanging out with guildies in comms in Ironforge (the nostalgia is so real lol) and I feel like the lore and questing is a bit more loved by the devs so I would like to experience that. 
---
Horde players? What did you love about being horde in vanilla? Am I missing out? I am a horde player for life, but there’s something about replaying with the alliance like I am 14 again that sounds so fun to me.
---
Not trying to be condescending. Just play the game.
---
That remark is pretty condescending
---
Play Dark Souls to make WoW leveling a breeze by comparison.
---
I was elected to lead, not to read!
---
They will yes and on the first week the 10,000 people around level 10-20 will be where? In the starting areas which will be flooded. Layering is temporary solution to stop this from happening. It’s not a permanent thing.
---
That's pretty spot on for my ideal 5 man -depending on the day of the week.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Running as a group full time my ideal runners would be
---
* Prot Paladin(Imp BoW -&gt; BoSanc)
---
* AoE Mage(Slow Blizz)
---
* Warlock(??? idk how these work. Summon please?)
---
* Shadow Priest
---
* Boomkin Druid as Healer
---
Mage + Warlock for the running instances non stop and giving ports/summons as needed. Mana Heavy group so unlimitted water is a plus. Int benefits the group. Heavy on the AoE kiting so
---
Prot Paladin. More so to round up AoE pulls for the Mage to slow with Blizzard. Also solid on the BoW being passed around to the mana heavy group.
---
Shadow Priest for Stam buff and steady group heals. If I was to swap out a class it would be this for a Clever Trap -&gt; BM Hunter. Aspect of the Pact would be nice for some faster running at times and would add a lot of gear diversity to the group. Although if Suvival Hunter came you would likely need a resto druid instead of a bad ass
---
Boomkin Healer. Improved Thorns on tank synergies great with Retribution Aura and the AoE pull mentality. Boomkin would be in the toughest position needing to know when he can deal some extra burst with that sexy Owlbear Crit Aura(when Shadow Priest Healing is enough). The large cooldown on Hurricane is less of an issue when the character is officially healing and clawing his mana back up(Judgement of Wisdom please pally?) and procing those omens of clarity. When the group dies tho, its because the Boomkin evolved into an Oomkin. Not to worry though because
---
wow would this party have a lot of ups. Warlock Soulstones the Druid so if anyone else dies he can combat rez. If that falls through we still got the paladin that can Divine intervention the shadow priest thats cowering in a safe position. Paladin and Druid die with no SS or DI out? Thats fine, the 3 DPS are actually a full party. Warlock busts out a Voidwalker to offtank as the Mage AoE kites everything in circles. Priest meanwhile realizes they need to save the party, again, and begins prioritizing spirit tap targets for the high mana regen as the heals come flowing out.
---
Too bad I think my 3 friends that are playing are all going rogue. I'll probably be a tank trying to maintain aggro with no heals as they all vanish and cackle at my death.
---
Good Luck [u/Filipino\_Ray](https://www.reddit.com/user/Filipino_Ray/), good luck.
---
Cope? It's a fucking game, dude. If you're so invested in an imaginary faction that it upsets you to change sides, seek help. 
---
Started as Horde in Vanilla, loved the 'underdog' theme Horde had before the xpacs started. Stayed with them until sometime around WotLK when Wyrmrest Accord launched. I'd had my fill of my pvp servers and wanted to wallow in RP for a change. Heard Alliance is the side for RP, so I rolled Alliance on WrA and that was my home until I quit in MoP.
---
Realistically, unless you are farming ubrs for a really long time and not raiding, you will get something better long before you get dal'rends, such as Lok'delar, Stave of the Ancient Keepers. This is assuming you are not just an ass and need rolling on it over rogues &amp; warriors.
---
Expansions should add content. Cataclysm actively removed content. That's why it is my most hated wow xpac. It may not even be the worst xpac as BFA is way more of a slog than cata ever was but even so I hate that thing on principle.
---
&gt;Stonewind Keep
---
wait what?
---
That first comment talking about how they're gonna get together for D3.. 
---
I too remember when I was optimistic about new things Blizzard made.
---
Yikes how much more cringe can you get lol
---
A few reasons.  Not sure why you think it is lonely either.  I will most likely being hanging out with people in discord.
---
* First reason is I will be leveling with 2 sets of friends.  One group needs a tank, the other group needs a healer.  Easier to just level them at the same time.
---
*  Another set of professions.  Warrior will be mine/eng and the priest can then use tailor/chant
---
* Ease of soloing when grinding or other wise alone.  Can just watch some TV while  I grind out the levels
---
I'm in this boat... Definitely prefer Undeads aesthetics, though wanna play Rogue where WotF and Stun resist are both gonna be useful, except Stun resist has the upper hand (arguably). But Undeads simply don't have that pretty damn hefty damage cooldown.
---
25% increased AD right? That sounds pretty nuts, though I haven't yet seen it in effect.
---
just heal him and ask him not to use it instead of being petty
---
I'm treating you like the child you are.
---
I let out an awkward chortle during class when I read this comment. Well done!
---
It was obviously a joke yes, but even as a joke it made no sense. Auto loot was already in classic the speed didn't change. For his joke to work the looting speeds would have to be at least slightly different.
---
[removed]
---
Says the dumb ass who claims there is only a "tiny amount of people who want to play Classic" cmon dont be so fucking stupid.
---
Flying mounts I think work well in TBC because it definitely has a space feel to it and you needed flying mounts to do botanica, mechanica, and alcatraz and those were all required for karazhan attunement. It really wasn't immersion breaking in that Xpac. Flying mount became immersion breaking when they brought it to azeroth in cataclysm.
---
Started as Horde on a PvP server, plan to roll Alliance on a PvP server or RP-PvP if it exists. Main reason? I want pretty saber mounts. I've never gotten a NE to max level, so I might as well try to this time.
---
"Common as shit", it's actually getting amusing now. Please keep going. I imagine you being one of those who actually didn't play but so desperately tries to pretend you did. If you can find me one screenshot of a chatbox where someone says "LFM x, y reserved" from vanilla, preferably from before TBC prepatch and massive bonus points for relatively early on (aka before everyone was fully geared already and were just boosting alts), I'll gladly shut up and accept defeat. 
---
Just ONE screenshot, one shred of evidence that it was a thing, go on mate.
---
Don't forget to get the [fridge/toilet/microwave seat](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8d/18/23/8d182356ea3764701c0032c5c35dde5f.jpg) for maximum drinking, eating, pissing and pooping.
---
Just play the game
---
I would really like to see ZERO things changed (unless if it’s bug related). 
---
I’m kinda loving seeing the the bitching, moaning and lack of knowing how to ACTUALLY play your class in Deadmines. There has been a pretty big uptick in private server populations and I can’t tell you how many players who “have played since 2011-12-13-etc” but can’t run a simple DM without getting wiped. 
---
I think the whole being-forced-to-travel unless you can get a summon is all apart of the fun back in the day. Time to have the newer generation know what it was like and being forced to walk, chat (ahhhh Barrens) and dodge high level mobs. 
---
#SuperExcited
---
I love org! Lol
---
*Shaka brah!*
---
By making the game "free"  (disregard the $180 per year to play) they don't owe us anything, we are lucky we get updates at all.
---
UA in BGs were king.  I remember just tossing on FC tanks and they'd melt.
---
Yeah they nerfed the crap out of fury generation and all warriors were in a lot of pain for the first bit of TBC, it was patched back to ok after a while though.
---
Someone posted on this sub that instead of taming an Owl, horde hunters should tame a duskbat. It's probably not too hard on Classic, but since private server mobs use their abilities every time they're off cooldown, it's literally impossible at level 11 to tame one. They ravage me every 5 seconds and interrupt my spell. Any idea how it's possible to tame a duskbat?
---
The cost depends on the quality of the food..
---
Fast dagger+flame tongue, shield, refresh Lightning Shield if it’s gone, pull with LB if necessary, cast highest tier flameshock, melee down the mob. Mana should regen to near full by the time current mob dies. Heal if necessary, refresh LS, next mob.
---
Only break regen to cast a heal, downranked Earthshock for interrupt, or downranked frostshock for slow if absolutely necessary to avoid death.
---
Spec enchantment, skip 2h weapons and don’t bother with final point in stormstrike (not worth the mana to cast, really). Then either go ele for faster kills or resto if you want to heal dungeons more easily.
---
For gear, focus on balancing stats as opposed to stacking any single one. Top priority is to have a fast, high DPS dagger.
---
If you’re playing shaman 2h WF build and spamming max rank frostshock, your burst dps might be amazing, but your experience per hour is going to be garbage. If you try playing like a mage and spamming LB/CL and shocks on CD, your burst will be *meh*, and your exp/hr will, again, be garbage (and you’ll go broke from all the water you drink). If you play it as described above, however, Shaman becomes a very efficient leveling class.
---
Are you able to use all types of throwables (grenades etc.) if you aren't an engineer? Like could I just go mining and have a guildmate make them for me with my mats?
---
Stopped playing a few months after Cata came out. I did however have to take a break after Ulduar, so I kinda missed ToC and ICC. I would have probably quit late-wrath as these 2 patches were horrendous also.
---
&gt; They are only doing layering because it's the least-damaging, least immersion breaking option they have.
---
It it literally the most-damaging, more immersion breaking option they have. What is wrong you people defending this crap?
---
&gt; Server merges. This is a horrendous option. You have get all of the economic manipulation of having multiple server economies being combined with the additional problem of duplicate names and the demoralizing effects on those merged servers. 
---
Not an issue if the merges are pre-planned. They could even leverage their sharding tech to do it. I agree the economy will be a mess during the merge, but at least it happens only once instead every single hour of every single day until layering is removed.
---
Most importantly, this is *by far* the best option for preserving the community of the game. It is vastly superior to layering.
---
I'd also be okay with dynamic spawns, but it's certainly a subpar solution as well. At least it doesn't destroy the community.
---
Not really true.  Since you don't rage dump with heroic strike rage isn't really an issue.
---
This is so much cooler than the dragons in ESO
---
So I picked horde because my older friends did, I went with a warlock because i really wanted an infernal after seeing them in wc3 and the intro, I'm not sure why i picked orc but I never once made more then a few bank alts, I made him bald and with a really ugly beard and i never once questioned my loyalty or if slaughtering alliance scum was the right decision, I was 14 when I created my character and regreted for some time I did not pick UD until i got a wolf instead of the poor dreadsteed and felsteeds that looked like they would cave in under my character.
---
Then about a decade later after hearing about classic release we tried private servers out, and while I did my absolutely best to show her the hordes best looking sides I quickly went out of cards to play after showing how cool taurens can look and how wonderful  and beautiful mulgure is, we got to about level 10 as two druids before she wanted to try some other class as she wanted to play as a female character that did not look like a cow. I opened up 3 accounts with 1 of each character the best coolest i could make them aswell as complimenting with pictures in awesome raid gear. It all fell apart when she saw a night elf druid with cenarion shoulders and heard about hunters when i showed her trolls, she was set when she hard about the pet she would get to tame and keep. 
---
-"Can night elfs be hunters?", 
---
-"well yeah but they are alliance and those guys suck, did i not tell you about all paladins being total dicks?"
---
She countered with: "you would essentially be getting a new game as you have never played alliance". 
---
...
---
So now I'm a alliance player and it really was a whole new game seeing the alliance side for sure, during the entire leveling process I was still shouting "ALLIANCE" sometime into 60 to my partner when i saw a enemy player, she ran right into them the first few times before she learned its a callsign for enemies and not actual alliance players. After a few months of private servers I was still getting lost in Ironforge/Stormwind and sometimes could not find repair vendors without using internet resources. Paladins was not such dicks afterall now when they dont bubble + hs out on you and it sure is easier in raids, also looking looking cool and having houses without holes in them sure seems nice. 
---
This time i got her to play a human mage which feels like a step in the right direction, I'm sure I might be able to get her on the right side next time if tbc or wow+ releases.
---
May your stomach always be full and may your colon always be empty. King's honor, friend.
---
Blizzard may slide down that slippery slope if Classic does well 🤞🏼
---
Fucking Payo.
---
&lt;3
---
Wow a top guild you say
---
Have you ever seen screencaps of Kungen from back in the day?  I'm pretty sure its fairly inarguable that Nihilum was the best in the world for a long time, and while maybe not quite on Sebudai's level, Kungen wasn't exactly a peachy guy if people were fucking up.
---
What races and what classes you thinking about?
---
&gt; that is funny because every mmo on the market [...] has multiple servers and shards to handle people logging into an area. 
---
And this is why most MMOs are not very good anymore. I don't see why Classic should stoop to this level.
---
Even my brother and I find something of value in POE on speed map clears with alts waiting inside for currency boost, we sell and split.
---
You make it sound like he's just screaming at everyone at all times. I almost guarantee you everyone one of those quotes was after he politely asked them to fix the problem repeatedly.
---
This is a high-end progression guild. People who join these types of guilds understand what they're getting into and are expected to know their class inside and out. A majority of them did and likely were never yelled at or berated. Not even once.
---
On the flip side, you have people who just aren't capable of reaching that level. Players making the same mistakes over and over and over again. They never improve and everyone else is sick of carrying them every night.
---
\_\_\_
---
You can talk hypotheticals all day, but in the end, Juggernaut completed all the content in the entire game for as long as the guild was active. People were beating down the doors to get in and it had a generally low turnover rate.
---
Don't want to be reprimanded for wiping the raid for the 100th time that evening because you're an adult that doesn't need to be yelled at? Going to cry because the mean internet man said some swears?
---
How about fix your shit and quit wasting the time of 39 other people.
---
Nope, they aren't synchronized. Coordinated, yes, and their coordination was impressive and creative, but a MBoxer wouldn't be capable of doing what they do without savant-level ability or a crazy number of very specific macros for every situation.
---
[Take this for example](https://youtu.be/wtThr78vpGU?t=54) (warning: annoying streamer noise), where they all run off in different directions after the fight is over. One jumps, one looks to cast vanish, etc. Even when they're spamming their /say macros, it is at different times, while a MBoxer would press a single button and all characters would respond simultaneously.
---
The world is semi-persistent, but you're allowed to switch worlds if you wish.
---
If you want to pvp not having engineering is just putting yourself at a disadvantage.
---
I can’t think about anything else for the most part. I am soooo bored without it. I’m jealous of steamers getting to play. The fact that I used to hate leveling and now will gladly level over and over on tests and beta (I wish) to get my fix before release means I am legit al the way in. I’m also reading the WOW Diary which is fantastic btw. Is it August 26th yet?!
---
You could just, y'know, not join the group and make your own instead.
---
These bats are untamable because their Ravage ability knocks you down every 5 seconds. Any other recommendations for pets?
---
You may need to re read my comment
---
And what if the server pops do not become stable? Seems like everyone ignores this very possible outcome. My bet is that layering is going to be permanent. My second bet is that this subreddit will defend it as they do for every silly thing Blizzard does.
---
As all things should be.
---
Pretty dead set on warrior for the challenge and I want to tank. Between human Tauren and orc
---
This was one of my ideas as well, doing reserved slots. Pay $10 up front, reserve a single character slot on a server. This allows Blizzard to manage the size and playerbase of the servers by having people assigned to servers before-hand, makes them money so it's worth their time, and keeps layers out of it!
---
Is 3% crit on 4 melee + a feral Druid better than 5 melee, though, is the question.
---
In my experience having had 3 characters with Enchanting to 300 it is a money pit until you get to 300 AND farm/buy the rare recipes. A lot of money can be made at end level but it's a struggle for sure DE'ing every unique+ item endlessly. Even at end game when I could have been selling Large Brilliant Shards for a lot of gold I just kept them because I needed them... Tips will be a main income but even that is low until 300. Expect to farm a ton of recipes to be worth anything and good luck on winning the AQ enchants.
---
It's really about design philosophy. Vanilla and TBC, the "casual" content was in the bulk of trade professions, leveling, and battlegrounds, but you were also kind of expected to do dungeons *somehow*. In WotLK, they decided that dungeons should be designed as casual content as well, so they built LFD tool on top of LFG. There was no prestige or bragging rights that came from dungeons (except in rare cases), so the effects were benign as far as I know.
---
They can.  They're not going to.  Ask yourself this instead:  Why should they?  What is "many people" to you doesn't mean it's enough to be worth their time and effort, and continued support.
---
As you are aware, time is money, friend.
---
What you as suggesting is literally just Planned Server merging, but calling it Static Layering. 
---
What people seem to not grasp is that 'Classic' is not just for the people who are hardcore #nochanges, it's for everyone. If someone wants to come see what it's all about for a day or two, that's fine. We should embrace this, not punish it by making them stand in Queue. Queues are Archaic by today's standards. 
---
If people want log-in queues, do they also want unstable servers? Probably not.
---
This Friday I’m having elective surgery to have most of my large intestine removed so I can play Classic while I’m shitting in a colostomy bag.   Having normal bowel movements is meaningless now.
---
Got hurricane leveling my hunter during vanilla days it was crazy!
---
This looks awesome tbh! I’m going to keep an eye on this “Korkron” guild!
---
All engineering explosives require engineering to use.
---
Green skin
---
Also, afaik Lore is pretty infamous for being incredibly out of touch with the community relative to his job description. 
---
He thinks he knows the community, but he don't.
---
Welcome to hit me up anytime to group up! What classic is all about! 🍻
---
Are you sure wont regret not going night elf for that awesome shadow meld + mind controlling people off boats and into lava?
---
Yeah, working 5 nights a week some 5-7 hour a night would be even harder with a mortage that big, if anyone else is in this situation try to  compliment it with other things like materials or services then hard gold as suggested by others.
---
Can you still **feel** the anxiety from thinking about it?
---
I see what you mean and yeah you’re right. Glancing is higher on the attack table, meaning that those 40 out of 100 attacks would be glancing blows regardless of your % of white attacks. Which makes WS even more critical to reduce glancing dang penalty.
---
Wtf is asmongold?
---
It is.
---
Who flasks in MC?
---
I'm merely stating facts, never claimed I was making an argument
---
You can always see trivial quests.
---
Look on the positive side: Private servers can datamine the shit out of classic and perfect all the holes. In a year or so, we'll have private servers that are a significantly better product than the Blizzard version.
---
"ow" means you are in pain or hurt, you mean "Oh" which is surprised or shocked.
---
Bear druid in Naxx though.
---
Yup, for me it depends on my mood. I considered my alliance characters to be my PvE characters, and my horde to be my PvP characters. Alliance had an enormous population advantage, which made it easier to get into raids without being a super serious PvE hero, and I love being outnumbered, which made horde the best for PvP. 
---
I don't get the loyalty thing either, but sometimes it's fun to play it out a little.
---
You haven't known of Karazhan for a decade?
---
Hi there Blazzuris, thanks for your feedback!  I have a region dropdown selector for the guilds.  They can choose whatever region they wish.  As for users and characters, I need to add that but I plan to do that.  Have you gotten a chance to register for the site?  I would love any positive or negative feedback on the process of doing so :)
---
With a !    ?
---
I never succumbed to hating other factions.
---
Also, I started Horde and built a crafting army of alts, then made an alt on Alliance. So I stayed grounded on Horde side because that's where all my gold and crafters were, but I got to experience a taste of what it's like for devs to not actively hate your faction.
---
And that's bad.
---
RemindMe! 730 days
---
Stopped at Cataclysm, went Back for Legion a bit.
---
Stopped because it feels like a game and not like a "World"

Hyped for Classic to bring back the World of Warcraft!

No zug zug?
---
I can't speak for other classes but with Druids:
---
Feral DPS can be very competitive if you put in the time. There is a big stigma here though, so you will have to sell yourself. You can also go a hybrid Tank/DPS spec which is super fun.
---
Druid tanks are very strong, not at all a meme spec.
---
Resto has 0 problems in dungeons. The lack of a rez does hurt, but you won't be turned away from a group. Healers are in such high demand people absolutely won't care about this. 
---
You don't need to worry about quotas (the whole 1-2 spots thing) unless you're in a semi hardcore guild. Guild leaders have a hard enough time keeping a squad together in Retail, let alone the 40 you need for Vanilla.
---
Some people aren't even roleplay. My college psych professor let slip that he played WoW, and there were legitimately students who stayed after class to tell him Alliance sucked.
---
Go with a quest addon and only have the minimap for finding quests, go to options and add "show grey quests", there is no way to stop your experiance in vanilla so some twink accidentally overleveld and had to remake their character. I want to remember you'll still get all experiance from the quests but the experiance will be much lower compared to a yellow or green one.
---
Lol. If they were being paid it would have been a toxic workplace.
---
I don't know how to explain to you that getting angry at people is bad both for you and for them.
---
I prolly won’t be in a progression guild.  Life is too busy...  I can dream though!  Haha
---
Chiming in again, at what pve tier is there a noticeable power spike in PVP? Is it demigod mode with tier 1, 2, 2.5?
---
Hey Kaufdrop!  I'm going to be adding that feature shortly, I have it working locally, I just want to knock out a couple other features while I'm here.  Once it's in production you will be able to find a person's discord username and contact information (if they provide one/both) in their character's page.
---
Layering is anti-cohesive and illogical. They're saying that the game is going to see a massive player spike and then people are are going to leave the game. So they need a mechanism to handle launch when they have a massive player spike so people don't leave the game.  
---
So are people going to leave the game or are they not? The only people suffering are those that are going to continue playing the game, not the tourists.   
---
Launch servers that can simply handle 12k connections rather than the 3k at original launch and let everything sort itself out. People will laugh, people will cry, they will group, they will create raids of level 1's and storm areas, and they will overall be people and make the most out of it while causing a lot of mischief and memories. There would be youtube videos for ages remembering the launch. Would take a whole fews for the mess to sort itself out as some people power level, some people give up, and some leisurely take their time.  
---
Separating everyone is wrong in Classic, we wanted the community back, now it's faced with the community being once again divided in the name of allowing some people to kill some wolves. Just make the servers ridiculously large so that when there's a major population die off it won't matter because there's enough to fall back on.  
---
Better yet, do $10 paid server reservations so that those serious about Classic can get on a server that has a defined population limit and allows Blizzard to control exactly what's going on and separate those that don't want layers from the rest of the servers.
---
awesome, thanks for replying with so much info. 
---
Even asking the question I knew it's very unlikely but just a thought
---
I decided to try botting because a guild mate got me to try it and lost my account in a week. An account I had since BC lost because I was an idiot in MoP. Had so many great achievements (High Warlord), mounts, and items. I just couldn’t pull myself to restart again. I eventually did again in BFA because of character boost but couldn’t pull myself to get into the game I miss my old account so much.... I’m an idiot.
---
Most professions have a market for selling something. But with gear crafting professions (Leatherworking and Blacksmithing in particular), the market will generally shrink over time as people get better gear from other sources. This is true of Tailoring too, but they have bags which will always have a very broad market.
---
Alchemy can be a gold mine and, if anything, demand for your flasks/elixirs will just increase as more people get into endgame. The Arcanite cooldown will earn you quite a bit too.
---
Enchanting has that awkward spot where you can't just throw up a load of enchants you know are valuable on the AH. You have to stand on a street corner selling yourself, hoping that the person looking for that Crusader Enchant happens to be logged in and looking at /2 when you're advertising. And even then you're relying on tipping. And the culture for that will vary widely server to server.
---
Apparently not. I’ve ran through Deadwind Pass a ton too.
---
You underestimate WoW Classic.
---
TBC got bored. Still loved running the BGs but everything else seemed grindy.
---
I was Horde from vanilla until just before Cata where I stopped playing until some new friends got me back in towards the end of MoP and I swapped to Alliance to play with them.
---
Going to be doing Alliance in classic since one of my friends wants to go pally and I realized I never actually did the Alliance questing before the Cata changes.
---
This "broken and frustrating" system sure sounds like a great gaming experience, glad we have people like you to make sure we get the proper experience and don't have *too* much fun when we play.
---
I mean up until Sylvanas made playing a Horde druid a seriously dubious proposition...
---
Yeah, I log onto retail WoW and just look at the character select screen and just log off.
---
Ion. Ever heard if him? 
---
https://youtu.be/VxymWyaYGMM
---
Important part at around 2:30.
---
Except now all that's out the window and layering has fucked it all up.
---
Personally, I thought having Aspect of the Viper and steady shot made the class a lot of fun, whereas Chimera Shot and Beast Within kind of felt like boring choices for abilities to make hunters more fun.
---
People will say you cant, but I played on a pserver with a 11.6 inch macbook air just fine. Game ran at around 50+fps most of the time
---
Because it will be dead servers soon. Many people will drop game before 40 lvl, maybe earlier.
---
Hey sorry you think people responding that your question is absurd makes you think there's something wrong with everyone else.
---
&gt; Blizzard will likely move the goal posts
---
They already have. Originally, they were just going to shard the starter zones, yet I was considered delusional for thinking they would do it to the whole world. Look at what happened.
---
A year ago, the very thought of layering/sharding being in Classic was an incomprehensible as adding LFG and LFR to Classic. I guarantee these people would also defend LFG with the same silly arguments: "It's to alleviate the wait time of walking to a dungeon. There's no other solution! Blizzard knows best!!"
---
I wouldn't be surprised if layering is permanent. More than that, I guarantee these same people will keep defending Blizzard over and over again.
---
I was hoping to avoid a quest add-on but if thats the only way...
---
\&gt;  **Where the hell is Frostadamus?** 
---
It's almost like he has a life outside of being obligated to supply you with content to watch. Have you tried emailing him? Or standing around outside his house? Maybe ringing him multiple times late and night?
---
If these fail to get his attention and you must send a message that your feeling ignored or that he isn't giving you enough attention I suggest killing his cat.
---
Don't forget about the ol' root-n-scoot, you could solo a fair number of outdoor elites that way as balance or resto
---
Doesn't really work when the layers are non-static. If they implemented layering properly, where each layer was 100% independent and you chose a layer like you choose a server, then I don't think many people would be complaining.
---
any news on leeway spellbatching and layering?
---
Atiesh BiS
---
I’ve played on a private server as well I’m just worried because I believe it’s my graphics card that is not supported for BFA and I don’t know if this same issue will occur with classic.
---
Because it happens once, and it happens overnight. With layering, it happens every hour of every day until layering is removed.
---
Ok I'm going to have to watch a guide or something. I want to be THE best for both pvp and pve. So you need to make the second run through for engineering to be the keeper, ofc (right?), so which is the best to keep? I'm gonna have to look so much up before I get started in this game.
---
He's rolling paladin of course.
---
Congratulations now you're like me for the last 2 and a half years!
---
Wait for a few days, then start a character. Or start a character and just run to an inn, log out for a few days and start with rested exp. Or band together with a few other people and fight mobs 2 or 3 levels higher. Patience is a virtue, I am wanting Classic to be here for a long time and is why I want the community on servers to be alive and not split from one another. If the simple fix for layers is waiting for 2 or 3 days to play, I can do that. Even with layering I will not seriously start on launch day, I might try to log in simply to observe the chaos.
---
It's three reserved characters, right? One main, one bank alt, and one stream-sniper?
---
It's just a classic ad hominem.  Ignore them. 
---
They can't be too bright after all, they're sharding apologists.
---
Like it or not? You didn't even read at all what I said, Blizzard are being cheap. Have you even played vanilla to 60 at all on anything in the past 5 years? Raided all the way up to Naxx etc? Do you actually know what layering does to the community? People are legit complaining about it on beta, the people who actually experience it and to be honest watching the "inv to layer" bullshit is gonna be abused so hard and already is on beta.
---
You have no idea, you're just repeating what Blizzard is saying.
---
rogue or hunter
---
&gt; Layering is literally splitting up a realm with a seamless merge down the road instead of making everyone change guilds and names.
---
This has been covered numerous times. It's not necessary if the merges are pre-planned as they should be. They are already planning to "merge" the layers anyway.
---
&gt; toxic memes
---
lol
---
Tower of the damned... that’s some content they can add in classic +
---
Even a pug or a bad guild is going to give it to the tanks. You would need to organize your own runs and then find competent tanks who are cool with you taking the bindings. Better start making friends with a lot of Druid tanks...
---
Well, casual guilds bring whoever, so it's not like you couldn't ever get a spot and I was on Ravenholdt, probably the most casual server ever...  but it was a going meme (before memes were really a thing) at the time in the forums during TBC.
---
The thing is, I love healing because it can be really dynamic and reward the healer who knows which heal to cast when, and even why the healing is needed (if a DPSer took momentary damage they won't be a priority compared to a DPS that has aggro and is being wailed on).
---
But DPSing is the same rotation every time, which feels a lot more like a "see how few mistakes you can make" game than a "make the right decision for the situation" game (which incidentally, is why I didn't like MOBAs and their 'last hit' systems).
---
I think a great middle ground would be a DPS system where the rotation itself is relatively simple, but there is a wide variety of situations where you would have to switch targets or stop DPSing altogether to play optimally.  Put a bunch of shields in the game where NPCs will reflect damage from DPS onto the tank if they don't time their DPS correctly, for example.
---
As it is now in Modern WoW though, it feels like playing Simon with colored lights popping up and then I just push the corresponding button... taking tons of attention, but little actual decision making.
---
Well back in Warcraft 1 Lordaeron was the capital Human city, and stormwind was well, just a keep :)
---
There’s an option to show low level quests.  Or you can go to almost any database site and search for the zone you’re questing in.  Will lists all quests for the zone there.
---
Layering will very likely become permanent. As soon as phase 2 rolls around and the population is still too high, Blizzard has a perfect excuse lined up to keep layering forever, and their fanboys will fall for it.
---
Most guilds that can clear aq40 can clear naxx. Cthun is harder than most of the bosses in naxx. It will be those that get stuck at huhuran/twin emps/cthun that also won't make much progress in naxx.

No my dude
---
Because that all takes a boat load of extra work.  They’re a business selling a product with the intent to make money.  If it don’t make dollars, it don’t make sense.  
---
Welcome to the world outside of your mom’s basement.
---
Inform your spouse how important it is and you would love all extra time you could get before new years. Start stacking points if you havent already.   
---
If you dont have a spouse or kids you could perhaps downgrade your living standards and maximise what cash you got saved up for some of time.   
---
If none of this is possible if you are able to check your phone often enough you could hire someone to play for you while you instruct them on a constant stream to your phone. Communicate with text mostly, that would cost the most money but is far from impossible.   
---
And if you have a kid above the age of 5 you are in luck as they are fully capable of remembering simple farming routes.
---
He means that its called stonewind in the map, nit stormwind.
---
Oh Wtf, I didn’t even see the stonewind lmao
---
Just fyi, lookup macro tooltips vanilla addon and you can get that functionality back.  Obviously it's a bit late with Classic around the corner, but there IS a fix for that.  One thing I'm going to miss is that in the preclassic macro language, you could do more with macros and addons.  That said, having macros and addons think for you or do multiple actions is probably against the spirit of Vanilla anyway, but it's going to be fun figuring out what creative and interesting things can be done in the new system.
---
You're welcome!
---
You are not wrong!
---
Mate private servers already have, dynamic respawn is better than layering and there will be less people per server on compared to private servers at fresh.
---
NELF Hunter all the way! Don't care about min/Max or viability. Love the class and the race. 
---
For The Alliance!
---
So the answer to "a bunch of mobs on one server breaks the economy" is "but actually there's a bunch of mobs on one server but you can only see a fifth of them." 
---
??
---
If a server with dynamic spawns has 500 wolves spawn an hour and then a sharded server has 5 shards with 100 wolves spawning an hour guess what, that's still 500 wolves an hour worth of mats being funneled into the auction house. 
---
It's just now you never see the other people killing the wolves because they're not really on your server.
---
Completely agree. It's objectively the best short term solution to a short term problem. These mouth-breathers that can't understand basic concepts would be the first people on the sub screaming about 7+ hour log in queues on launch day.
---
Yes I'm glad we got our fiftieth rendition of fantasy orcs, elves and humans, fuck blizzard for adding a slightly more interesting race. 
---
wait sorry i mean panda bad, china bad, upvotes to the left :)
---
Thanks for the ideas hadn’t thought about those
---
Its not especially if you are just doing the low level zones, you can talk to everyone everywhere and do it that way. But to be sure you could find some use for the excel list for all quests. There are some quests that might be a bit hard to find like  [https://classicdb.ch/?object=2554](https://classicdb.ch/?object=2554)  or the one saving a tauren from a gorilla if you dont use any resources but even with a questing addon getting them all would be a tedious task that would really benefit from more then just a quest addon
---
Fuck TBC
---
It might. I've already considered planning to prevent this. If you and someone else start playing but only group up later around level 10, then you may be in different layers from the start.
---
One of you is going to have to switch layers. That's going to mess up the immersion for them because everyone around them is different. That guy you quested with at level 7? He's gone. The trolls role playing in Sen'Jin village? They're all gone. Suddenly you're surrounded by total strangers.
---
Lol I love this do you have a blank version of it? Id like to have it.
---
The head devs for Classic said they are more than willing to create both TBC and WotLK servers in an interview a couple months ago. So yes they are willing to. It would certainly depend on the success of Classic. If Classic were hypothetically to flop I can't imagine they would move on, but I personally don't expect it to flop.
---
Classic good retail bad gimme upvotes
---
I'm still torn. Either I'm gonna stick Horde and play a Shaman or I'm gonna switch to Alliance to play a Paladin.
---
Paladin seems way more fun to play in a group setting (for me), but Shaman seems to have way more solo and wPvP options.
---
1.12 client has nothing to do with Classic. Being able to run the 1.12 client for pservers doesn't mean you can run Classic.
---
They will probably do TBC, maybe in like 2-3 years, Will be fun
---
Hah. Wish I knew how to code
---
Mate obviously you’re the dev we need, email your CV to Blizzard seems like you know your stuff.
---
Amateurs 😏
---
https://youtu.be/fcBNLHtsQzM
---
Back in WOD I had maxed every alliance character to 100, so I jumped to a PVP server and then did it again on horde side
---
Bow, the sound is ten times less obnoxious.
---
I like hunter but I also EVENTUALLy wanna do naxx
---
That would be as bad as separate realms that merge. Independent layers would mean that you could only interact with people on that layer, we need to be able to group, form guilds, and trade dynamically across them, otherwise the merge is going to be a clusterfuck. Not to mention, that's how layering could be abused extremely easily. Collect mats on X layer, switch to character on Y layer and collect, switch to character on Z layer and collect, etc. Even worse, you get to select a layer at character selection not creation. You can just run loops on multiple layers. I know it's still abusable as is, but at least it takes *some* run around to either get someone on a different layer to invite you or hope you relog onto a different one. That extra wasted time weeds out a lot of people.
---
A check list is a good idea. Will give me something to do for the next month xD thanks!
---
You can still loot a chest, wait for the cooldown, and start hopping, and quite easily get two chests.
---
Arena chest brawls can last 5+ minutes so unfortunately the cooldown isn’t going to prevent exploits
---
I did the exact same thing. Fucking hate the sound.
---
It was a fun tool though! It provided spell pushback and a second frost nova! That's pretty sweet. It felt like a natural progression for the mage since the Archmage Hero unit in Warcraft 3 had a spell where he could summon water elementals. I don't think it should have had a 2 minute cooldown though.
---
&gt; all general chat/trade channels are shared
---
Oh wow, I did not realize this. Fucking hell, layering is even worse than I though it was. What a silly way to ruin the game.
---
You won't be able to run Classic. My old macbook that can run pservers just fine can't even open the Classic client. I'm getting this error:
---
&gt; Your 3D accelerator card is not supported by World of Warcraft. Please install a 3D accelerator card with dual-TMU support.
---
SL/SL lock and resto druid = gg
---
If you know about layering, why do you think it helps with start zones? You disagreed that it would be 400 people in start zones so tell me what you think start zones will look like instead?
---
The reason why it was bad was because it had nothing to do with the lore or the overarching story WoW is telling.  When was the last time Pandarans were even slightly relevant to the plot?
---
Yea, just accept you'll be a filthy casual like the rest of us and it will take you 6 months to hit 60. It's about the journey anyway. I just hope they out enough time between phases where I won't miss content because I can only play 15 hours a week.
---
Because this is a community driven forum moderated by volunteers who are also in fact people, trying to make decisions on things that are inherently subjective.
---
want to see what reddit looks like without moderation? browse newly submitted. tryingd to find anything entertaining between the QQ layering/leeway/batching stuff gets old quick
---
I would just log into your Blizzard account and download the Classic Client on your mac and just try loading it. You won't be able to log in obviously, but you'll know if it'll even load.
---
stopped at your instead of you're
---
Then they shouldn't be in the cleft of shadow. Their class trainers should be in Thrall's throneroom for two reasons. 1 to keep closer eye on them, 2 to consult with them.
---
&gt;now it's faced with the community being once again divided in the name of allowing some people to kill some wolves.
---
to be clear, why would layering allow people to kill wolves?
---
Nice when it works out for your class! I used to cheat and use a leveling bot while I would do homework. I remember one night, looking over at my computer and seeing purple in the chat log. Heart sank - I ran over and sat down and saw that my shaman auto looted the Krol Blade! Felt so dirty getting that while using a bot haha
---
That's.. literally what layers are. I don't know how to make that any simpler.
---
You get hot brazilian girls, stop complaining
---
yes but i take codeine prescribed so in 2 months it will have felt like 1 day or less not an issue but i agree no other game is decent in terms of reward feeling. heck im even playing some private servers but not too much cause i dont wnt to ruin the experience
---
Yeah female undead, that hand shake is pretty cool looking.
---
If the layers were 100% separate and functioned like independent serves from the players' perspective then I'd be fine with it, but they aren't.
---
People forget Classic is pretty casual friendly. You can play not that much, and still eventually do all the raids it'll just take some real time. But if you can't put in a lot of time, can't really expect to be on the cutting edge of content. Find a guild who has people like yourself and just be realistic &amp; put in the effort you can friendo
---
Very likely.  
---
  
---
1. The world is already compatible with the modern client. The stack and workflow for 'Classic'ing content has already been worked out from Classic. They will have much better db/server/client backups of TBC than they had of vanilla. All this adds up to very fast implementation and very low cost of getting TBC:Classic out the door. This will be very enticing to the bean counters.    
---
    
---
2. A huge amount of stuff TBC fixes is stuff people will want fixed in any sort of Classic 60+, so it doesn't make sense to spend time going over all the mechanics/classes/spells/racials/itemisation again when that work has already been done for TBC, and by and large worked very well.
---
Oh, so the Rogue should have sold it to a twink. Got it! Thanks.
---
It just needs a shower then it’d be perfect.
---
Yeah good point. No need to rush content I guess.  It will hurt, but slow and steady might win this race.
---
TIL "literally every waking moment you're not raiding or healing a dungeon" is once in a blue moon.
---
I did get that, it doesn't really give "tooltips" the way retail client does.
---
&gt;having macros and addons think for you or do multiple actions is probably against the spirit of Vanilla anyway
---
...but they worked in the 1.12 client. Those macros ARE "vanilla".
---
Lolwat? Just enter the fucking dungeon. Either massively retarded or troll
---
I like this world better! :(
---
we need them for an authentic vanilla experience
---
Drink em if you got em?
---
you have to be a troll right? first you say orc racial is bad, now your saying rogue eats paladins? 
---
:/
---
you sir are delusional lol.
---
the machup is a wash at best the best option you have available is to run away and eat/bandage to full and take advantage of the fact that paladins have no ranged abilities and/or snares.
---
if your stupid enough not to disengage then a paladin is just going to slowly kill you.
---
Orc Rogues are objectively better than Troll Rogues, and if you care about PVP Orcs are abjectively better than Trolls, regardless of class.
---
&gt;You cant even read and understand the source you posted if you think its only 2 hit.
---
That is literally all I said. It is really not that insulting. It is the truth. You posted a source but have hardly delved into the facts at all.  
---
I see you deleted your response. Probably because you realized that private servers are not coded with 0.4% per point because that is utterly ridiculous.
---
Lol - thanks! Min/max 100%. Good insight.
---
Well I mean black morass does exist. It was just renamed blasted lands once the dark portal corrupted the land
---
that's a big kazoo
---
They're going to have to load balance the layers so that they don't have 100 on one layer and 2500 on another. I'm theorizing, but there will be multiple layers spun up based on closing in in high population and based on load. On launch expect a lot of layers and expect them to dynamically scale down and consolidate people onto new layers, or at least that's how I would do it... and how it sounds like they're alluding to doing it so they can merge layers.
---
If Blizzard keeps everyone in their original layer everytime they log on and off, that's going to be a huge mess as some layers will have 100 and others will have 1000 based on who stays and who doesn't.
---
As for people leaving, that's exactly my point. People are going to leave anyway, so why separate everyone? Just get the mess done and over with, those who really want to play and invite friends will stay, those who just came to see it will leave anyway. I would like to see everyone together from the beginning.
---
Fun fact: When you remove them from the group, a timer starts going for them. It clearly says they will be teleported out of the instance automatically. I believe it was a 15 second timer. It’s fun watching them run around, apologizing and begging to get back in, after they screwed up for the 5th or 10th time.
---
Another fun fact IIRC : Even if they rejoin the group instantly, they will still get teleported out. 
---
It’s just 1 of those things that made WoW Classic fun. 😃
---
Engineering. 
---
Blacksmithing isnt a good profession to get.
---
Pelvic thrusts to pay the bills\~
---
Certainly doesn’t need to be as there are a plethora of ways to make money pre 60. That being said, being a higher level usually means being more powerful/faster, which translates into farming more efficiently.
---
yeah that was my favorite part, soda has always lacked a bit of self awareness regarding these things but to mock people or use "haha you're poor and live off government assistance" as a streamer is wiiiiild. Does he really not realize how LUCKY he is to be in his position? This is like some boomer level of arrogance and lack of self awareness, holy shit.
---
Pretty sure we know Kevin given how much his dick gets sucked around here.
---
Heard it from /u/beardruid12 in [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9ggbb/how_does_the_thick_hide_druid_talent_actually_work/eszbnr9/). I didn't get a source, so I hope I'm not spreading bullshit. Maybe he will see this and provide us a source.
---
Yeah - I think my urgency has changed. I just really get a lot more enjoyment rushing at the start and playing with competitive people. That just might not be an option.
---
We don't do that here!  XD
---
time to learn Portugese i guess
---
Yes he is but in my opinion he has great design philosophy. He didn’t want to just copy the warriors taunt and tried to create a system for the paladin that revolved around taking damage to create threat. It didn’t pan out in vanilla sadly but in terms of class fantasy i think his head was in the right place. In TBC the prot paladins class fantasy was more realized.

The burden of proof are fucking idiots knowing what they’re talking about before ejaculating into each other’s gaping assholes.

Vanilla I loved the game having come from Warcraft 3 and Warcraft 2 when I was even younger. I never really mained anything in vanilla, I was an altohalic big time. Saying that I always favoured horde zones and the only race I liked in the alliance as NE because that was my main in WC3.
---
Then TBC dropped and my friends started playing and they all chose Horde. So I joined the horde for good until cata where I stopped playing wow.
---
If all you did was change the text on an existing meme then you made a shitty low effort meme.

If all you did was paste an orc head or a helmet onto an existing meme then you made a shitty low effort meme.

Search skarm on youtube. Thinking bears can't tank Naxx is so last decade.
---
Leveling a warrior was never hard. I did it back in middle school and I keyboard turned and spellclicked.
---
Agreed.

The only gnomes allowed, are the ones with pink hair
---
I entirely agree, its too bad paladin tanks arent as viable in raids but they do shine in 5 mans!

"haha you're poor, play alot of wow and live off government assistance"

Soda is such a tool with zero self awareness.
---
I haven't opened the blizzard launcher in a while, but I did today to check that and I can download classic. Has that been a thing for a while?
---
Alliance. I played Alliance until TBC and I like their questing better. Getting to some of the early and mid instances (WC, SFK, SM) will be a pain in the ass, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice.
---
Mages were fine , dps locks were higher but the real kicker was you couldn't mess lock or hunter up.
---
I'm in a similar spot. I thought 8.2 would suck up my time, but I remembered that I don't care right now. I mean, I do and I don't. I'll log on and raid tomorrow night, but I'm not sure if I'm going to enjoy it. 
---
I'm playing Two Point Hospital, a weird hospital management game. It's decent. 
---
I think what I'm looking forward to most in Classic is making new online friends, because no one I know irl, raid with, or game with otherwise wants to join me in classic. So I feel a little isolated in my hype.
---
Such a small and weak willed person.

You defined your reality.  Watch it happen.
---
I got 1 binding in vanilla and accumulated the mats. In wotlk went back and farmed for the other. Took a crap ton of runs. Good good accumulation while bored. But have had that thing equipped for Every expansion since. I know it’s not that cool now to have it but I ran around in bgs in wotlk and cata non stop with it having fun. Finally retired my rogue in MoP and never played the game again post MoP. Except 1 level in boa. Good luck on that journey. Even if your guild allows you, RNG better be your friend.
---
100% i hate this new difficulty is running around , instead of max dps, hps, and tank.
---
Okay, and they're expecting literally up to 83% of the population to quit by phase 2 (6 layers to 1 layer would be an 83% reduction in server population. 
---
In this case (if they are right), you'd get either 7 servers with just over 400 people each or 1 server with ~2,000 and 6 servers with like 140 each. If they are correct then you have potentially hundreds of dead servers that you will need to merge to get any sort of reasonable population out of.
---
You pool energy and use gouge and kidney shot to land backstabs. It’s absolutely more work/harder than combat swords but it’s how I leveled in vanilla and it’s how I’ll do it again :)
---
The long walks help keep groups together and prevent trolls imo. Having pservered it up, groups are much less likely to kick a new player who isn’t performing well, or makes mistakes because of the time to find a replacement. 
---
In my opinion, this harshness is better for the community.
---
Fifteen years ago i had 20mb down.  Just because you were on dial-up doesn't mean everyone was.
---
Higher ranks of scream cost more mana but fear more enemies. If you only need to fear one or two enemies, rank 1 is the most efficient.
---
Lol @ the other replies...
---
Sure, but if people dislike layering even more then it's still the better choice.
---
NE shadow meld is so under rated for pvp. I think it's better then the horde ones but I won't be switching sides.
---
yeah, and merging dead realms isn't as bad a situation as the phase 2 mass server transfers of layering.
---
with merges the servers that don't die are barely affected.  with layers even the servers that don't die are massively affected.
---
Priorities.
---
Scrap the wedding.
---
Play WoW like a beast.
---
Once phase 6 has been released and you get all your raid gear you can go find a wife.
---
I just mean so it doesn't give an unfair advantage in later expansions, because it'd be fairly rare.
---
Mmhmm it’s okay to destroy the community and immersion so level 2 players can kill enough kobolds
---
I call complete and utter bollocks on that, and even if it was true it wouldn't change that using the "How it was" argument in relation to responsiveness and hardware means you'd still have to make the AQ opening event completely fucking unplayable, and throttle loading times just because hurrdurr thats how it was.
---
Get your boss to play. Play with him/her... profit
---
[&gt;tfw](https://puu.sh/DQROS/3e084118f7.png)
---
What??? When did you start to play? 
---
Arthas (One of the 4 original eastern time zone realms) had a gigantic French Canadian population and many guilds were french Canadian or had french Canadian factions. Some could not speak English. Also, haven't toy ever heard of Chinese farmers? These guys really exist, and they don't speak English either. Spanish was common as well in American realms.
---
...this is a terrible visualisation...a spread sheet would have been much better.
---
Yes, you've described every single person that's anti-layering. Decent chunk of people.
---
Congratulated you on your amazing feat?
---
So what? I honestly 100% wont be playing classic with layering, the world being so empty was what made me quit wow in the first place.
---
Definitely a local, lives in the mage quarter
---
Here’s the thing though, you can be as butthurt as you want about people not wanting layering... if you have 14 hour waiting ques, play on a different server. It’s what we did back then... what changed!!!!!!????
---
I think the problem stems from gear. If there's no druid in a raid in vanilla, you DE their set. So they are often taken to soak up gear. Having a poorly geared priest vs a bis druid is enough to push the scales.
---
Almost every class got better by tbc. Id hands down take class design in tbc over vanilla honestly just a better game
---
Both those options seem worse than the system we have going on now.
---
What if they are convinced by a friend who is, say level 20 day 2, but their layer is full. They would have to wait in a Queue to play with their friend.
---
Moonkins and ret palas so they dont fall below the tanks.
---
The alternative is you no-life for 40 hours a week and wake up 3 months later with the shame, headache, and fucked up life. Not worth it man, just accept your an adult now. lol
---
\&gt;  then some are merged to get closer to that 3k   
---
Where does it say that? Every statement I have found does not allude to this as a common thing. It may happen at some point, but like a once a day type of thing.
---
They released numbers quarterly until WotLK, then for those two years they only released numbers at the beginning middle and end, all around times when there happened to be some some extra buzz that probably increased sub numbers. After Wrath to Draenor the only numbers were at the start and end of expansions which were definitely the times highest sub numbers possible.
---
This is my biggest concern. Don't split the community. Every private server that has started with vanilla and subsequently released a BC and WotLK expansion has seen major reduction in player base.
---
This is absolutely fair. There will certainly be a time and a place for warden staff, particularly when you are able to slap +25 agi on it. But classic wow is a game of leaps and inches, sometimes you'll sky rocket ahead with lucky drops, and other times you'll be stuck with something for a long time. 
---
Also, you might find yourself flush at certain points in time, so it might just be a lucky chance to pick it up for cheap, so never play on principle, always play the game as best you can and take it as it comes.
---
I don't know but I do find it a little funny that there are towns called Stonard and Rockard lol
---
That's NOT how it was though, watch the clip, that's the whole point of this post.
---
you called the orc racial bad:
---
&gt; I played a lot of alliance rogue on pservers. It's pretty bad. Some people claim pservers the orc racial is worse than in vanilla/classic but I doubt it.
---
you said you beat paladins:
---
&gt; I play a lot on pservers and beat paladins in duels often. I know pserver there are some differences but it's more or less the same.
---
????????
---
back in the day my main was undead . but for pvp i remember i really wanted an orc , most of your problems comes from rogues and warriors glued to you . its easier with orc . and casters are pretty easy anyway .
---
You can get alot of gold from enchanting. Just learn it and de all extra green/blue/purple gear you don't even have get a copper rod
---
K but google doesn't lose it shit if i type "I think layering will be ok" in the search bar.
---
Layering can be abused. Explain to me how increased responsiveness can be abused?  
---
What I just said isn't opinion by the way, it's fact.
---
That works soo well in retail, huh?
---
Tfw pservers provide a million times more better experiences because you get to know everyone on the server.
---
Mainly bear tanks are just better better in TBC (a lot of itemization.)
---
Speaking as a mage: It's hunter. Objectively.
---
If hunter trib runs are possible (which they were in vanilla), then hunter is the best gold per hour class in the game.
---
Everyone in the guild was an adult. That doesn't make them exempt from being called out when making the same mistake for the 100th time that evening.
---
What do you think is more important to a player in a bleeding edge progression guild; that the mean internet man said some swears or that their guild member fixes their shit and stops wasting the time of 39 other people?
---
So yeah, it's clearly not for you, but it definitely worked for others. That's why the guild stuck around for so many years while maintaining a low turnover rate and was able to finish all of the content spanning over at least six expansions.
---
Traitorous scum
---
The core skills etc of bears were not massively change it that Blizz provided itemization to allow them to tank better.
---
Yes with wow tokens you can grind gold in retail and pay for your subscription. Since they use the same sub you’re able to buy Classic time playing retail
---
For a level 60? Yeah, 1g is pretty much the standard.
---
Idk what WL is
---
But what happens when they get closer in level? Or hit 60 and this "layering" merge hasn't happened yet?
---
10-30 gold OVER the price of the mats you baboon!
---
Keeping/doing away with it yeah that's a different argument.
---
But the current iteration on Classic needs a lot of tuning. Edited other comment.
---
I think a lot of people, like myself, just didn't know about all the items added to the existing dungeons in 1.4. Was really confused for a while why I could not select bone slicing hatchet on sixtyupgrades for phase 1 for example. I was like "it drops from a standard boss in strat, obviously it should be in phase 1", but apparently not.
---
New path of exile league is pretty awesome.  Tried a private server, some overwatch, another Skyrim play through, another Witcher play through.
---
Really nothing I can get hooked into.  Just bidding time now.
---
Where did they go? Different private servers?
---
Don't know what he was using, but https://sixtyupgrades.com/ is great for organising that stuff.
---
Was the gf upset
---
MMORNG, not MMORPG
---
Lunk alert!
---
The layering merge is based on the idea that people will quit. If numbers are going down queue time to pick the popular layer would also be going down.
---
If those people are not quitting as expected, blizzards idiotic layering idea is going to lead to disaster anyway, so you better hope it actually works out as they planned.
---
I want my fucking Shield Bash/Pummel special treatment code.
---
I think arcane are best once you gear up more (shadow priest in group). Fire are good once you have some raiding gear even pre raid. Frost is also viable when you just start raiding but quickly falls off to fire.
---
Some stayed in vanilla, while some went to the new BC server. Then, some from each of those two went to the wrath server. It proliferated the population to the point that all three servers were underpopulated and there wasn't a vibrant enough community to keep the any of the servers alive
---
Shaman would be extra juicy
---
I remember soloing Teremus in vanilla as a hunter took me over an hour but was so much fun.
---
Meh. People are butthurt. Even if you dont like him he makes thousands as a streamer. My fav streamer has gotta be maldiva though. Even though I dont play warlock. I guess people just downvote cuz they are jealous of some half bald dude making thousands of dollars they wish they were making. Lmao. So salty. He might be cancerous but he is doing something right. And his chat is funny BECAUSE they are aggressively stupid.
---
think about it. if u invest by "trying" it for 14 days then you are more likely to subcribe and buy the gosh darn game because u are more invested into you character whatever.
---
Those are migrations and server transfers. They NEVER merged servers. Merging servers would make them have to deal with problems like, what happens when two people on merged servers share the same name?
---
I think a decent idea I've heard was to sell character transfers/copies from Classic to BCclassic. I really hope that - if they do this - level caps can be 60 and/or 70 indefinitely.
---
Though I think I prefer the idea of adding new lvl 60 content more, taking it a different direction from 15 years ago. What if Kel'thuzad won?
---
That was based on an interview in an obscure Polish gaming magazine that Blizzard themselves seem to have discredited.
---
https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/4/13167592/world-of-warcraft-legion-subscriber-numbers-10-million
---
&gt;Polygon reached out to Blizzard directly this afternoon to confirm the number, and the publisher revealed that it "was a misquote or some kind of misunderstanding on the part of the journalist." Blizzard neither confirmed nor denied whether 10.1 million is the actual subscriber number at the moment but simply reiterated that it’s not planning to provide subscriber numbers any more.
---
They could speak english... but they dont... if they ever try it never makes a lick of sense... have you ever played on a US server during cross realm.? If you see a Latin server in your dungeon you were 9 out of 10 times doomed.
---
I think its 33% and 50% for the upgraded jumped cable
---
I wont play on layered servers at all, no. If the layers are removed after a month then so be it, I can start then. It's not nonsensical that I dont want a single player/randoms experience, but to play with people that I recognize from the start.
---
&gt;Yes he is but in my opinion he has great design philosophy.
---
He didn't give a tank a taunt... and you think he has a great design philosophy?   Sounds like an idiot that made the game worse through sheer incompetence.
---
Because it’s annoying if half your public channels are non-English. It also affects communication negatively and can be quite alienating to one or the other. It would be better if everyone assimilates to English but that of course is a dream.
---
So you are suggesting picking a layer upon logging in? This would not solve the layer hopping fiasco. I would suggest you read some posts and watch some videos on the negative impact of planned server merging.
---
This is sad news.
---
This is the exact error I received when I tried to run BFA I guess I will have to see if I can boot camp my computer and run it through the windows side?
---
Yes, it's at least very close:

If you follow the numbers of the last year using archive.org, there are several instances where Italy has more active players than Brazil, and in all other cases, the margin is within a few thousand.
---
What prayer of mending, is awesome. CoH is also good.. come on.
---
Even Azeroth has politics. Just because you need someone strategically doesn’t mean you want to be seen with them publicly.
---
Warlock not Hunter bro haha. Kiting while leveling when you have 5 people properly coordinating for the entire grind from 1-60 is not necessary. Soulstone, healthstone, summons, fear CC, and more per utility make loc the better choice. 
---
Rogue for picking locs and stealth but druid could work.
---
Hope they don’t do TBC and go the classic + route instead. Although I loved TBC, it started implanting some of the systems that resulted in wows downfall and made it feel less RPGish.
---
Jesus, beast master hunter with dragonspine trophy was so facerollable that it was almost not fun
---
Not Spellbatching at all.  The blizzard thing is normal.  Damage doesn't start for about 1.5-2 seconds, and the freeze effect only goes off of damage.  That's why mages frost nova before casting blizzard or have a tank.
---
The hunter trap is not normal, but that has to do with how your position updates on blizzards servers.  If you try zig zagging through the trap, you'll get hit by it.  If you stopped moving on the trap, you'd be hit by it.  But when you're running in a straight line, your position is updated every .5 seconds.  So you can run through most traps if you are running in a straight line on a mount AFAIK.
---
You’re partially correct. The world first races didn’t include mages into **most Sunwell progression- you can view this in the world first videos. Mages weren’t required for a buff either, Sunwell had an internal zone buff that replaced It.
---
The issue was that Warlock SB spam was incredibly high DPS so class stacking was optimal.
---
Although, “serious” raiding guilds still took their mages jnto Sunwell, and after progression mages still found play. It was a very low percentage of hardcore world first chasers who culled the class.
---
It can’t run it through the Mac side but would it potentially be able to run it as a windows program? I already have my comp bootcamped.
---
Guess what, we non-english speakers have to deal with english all the time, so hey, I'm sure you'll find a way :')
---
PvE Allies&gt;Horde everyday.
---
PvP in AV A&gt;H , everywhere else  H&gt;A.
---
The racials favor horde in pvp for most, pve is a mix. The real difference come between paladins and shamans, pallies are just really strong in raids up to 3-4 of them largely providing the same buffs that 6 shamans do.
---
Wonder if that'll stay true for Classic! I guess they are indeed more into League and all. Problem is, this'll stay true BECAUSE of no Brazilian server.
---
Double ugh
---
No you didn't. Shut the fuck up with your cringy flex attempt.
---
When the spirits don't respond so you just show up at their house.
---
That was nerfed in a patch a few months in, IIRC.
---
&gt;  The prot paladin is  the worst spec in the fucking game.   That's saying a lot for Vanilla wow, because most of the specs are bad.
---
Enhancement shaman was supposed to be able to offtank. That's why they get shield spec. It's why Earthshock does huge threat.  
---
They don't even get to spec stormstrike in raids because it takes up a slot. I'd say they're easily contenders for worse than prot.
---
Maybe, but I doubt it. Give Retail an attempt through a trial account.
---
Be the beast!
---
&gt;Do you guys expect Blizz to continue classic with TBC? 
---
Yes, easy money and supported by the community as a whole, what's there to loose?
---
Fury warrior was def better in Classic than BC. Though not completely useless, I maintain in BC if you play or bring a fury warrior, you really wanted a good rogue, as a good rogue will out dps an equally skilled fury warrior. 
---
Rogue kind of has a similar path to classic - not so great near the start, hard to get groups/guilds. Power houses at the end. 
---
Mages took a hit, an optimal 25-man raid comp brings 1 mage pretty much for the table and buff. 
---
Arms took a hit, but one is very much wanted in a raid. 
---
Prot warriors are still the tank Kings in bc, to the point an optimal guild wants 2 Prot warriors, 1 Prot paly and 1 feral druid tank imo. 
---
I think disc healing takes a hit, is that a thing in classic? I know my priest friends laugh at the idea of having a disc priest in raid, or is it holy? I forget now. I know disc is good in pvp, so now I'm questions which spec is bad for pve... It's probably disc. 
---
Hunter BM gets a buff, MM gets nerfed (basically no one wants an MM hunter in bc, where as the only raisable spec in classic is mm) and survival gets a buff in the sense that, once you have a hunter that can reach 1k ago I believe, you want them to go survival for the debuff a survival hunter brings. 
---
Outside of feral dps, every druid spec gets a buff. 
---
All paladin specs are buffed or on par with before.
---
Shaman are all on par with before at least. 
---
And as far as a class goes, warlocks kind of get a buff with both factions getting salv, and misdirect allowing better tank threat.
---
If your min maxing, gnome is the way to go. 
---
I'll be playing a gnome for the first time in classic for that reason.
---
Then I'd had to pick undead
---
Non option for me
---
This comment is the best comment here.
---
Layering sharding x realm whatever, no need to get stuck on semantics like an asshole, yoy know exactly what I meant. 
---
And thats the whole problem, even if they have less players the words feel so much more alive, it's not even close.
---
Tuning? What?
---
Yep Google it
---
Tell me it'll be okay brother, I've never played one.
---
Can you ELI5 Pummelers?
---
Personally I loved how complex my warlock dps rotations got as the game evolved. Hitting haste thresholds, reapplying dots when big cooldowns or trinkets or procs were up, reapplying them right before those same cooldowns expired etc.
---
Shaman tanks would be worse.  I don't think enhance shaman is worse in general, though it's still really really bad.
---
Alt f4 is my favorite one, works on every class flawlessly.
---
The philosophy behind it as that there is something inherently Vanilla-like about double sheeps, double gouges, double charges, etc and it deserves to be preserved in Classic.
---
That said, the current Iteration on Classic needs fine-tuning and/or a smaller batch window. If the playerbase's average ping went from 300ms to &lt;80 ms, shouldn't the batch window be decreased by a similar amount?
---
&gt;I call complete and utter bollocks on that, 
---
I don't care.
---
Short simple and correct
---
Monster Hunter: World.
---
Is there a way to identify which layer you’re on?
---
Look at all these fucking morons that think broadband didn't exist in the year 2000.
---
Brazil has never truly had servers. Sure, there are a few designated for their language and timezone, but they've always been hosted in Los Angeles, which is 150-200ms away.
---
Nice.
---
Don't buy a garbage tv and it's not an issue.

Earliest mindflay rang 4 lvl44 good
---
Take the whole company down lmao
---
i agree 100%, but right now it's not even what it was then. you couldn't walk over a freeze trape back then. atm its just bullshit artificial lag.
---
&gt; If I run the game through a bootcamped Mac do you think it’d work?
---
Do you know why you can't run it in MacOS? If it's the gpu bugging out windows might not help, but if it's because your OS is too old (which is very possible with an older mac) it will probably work on windows. 
---
Just try installing it on windows and see if it works. 
---
If BfA won't run at all then classic will most certainly not run either. If it runs but really badly (terrible fps), you might have a small chance at running classic, it should be a lot less resource intensive than BfA.
---
I started ducking around playing against ai in Starcraft 2, a decent game will last 30 minutes. But yeh, I have no will or desire to play anything and I haven’t for a while.
---
My guild had a number of people get one binding. All the same one. the other never dropped. So much wasted mats
---
Jokes on them, I'm a Caster Chad
---
It's not semantics when phasing and layering aren't the same thing. But it's cute how you fit the perfect private server stereotype. :)
---
No, why?
---
Retail is classic+. Let's not do that.

&gt; that there is something inherently Vanilla-like about double sheeps, double gouges, double charges, etc and it deserves to be preserved in Classic.
---
Then you absolutely must explain why that is inherently Vanilla like, but having the zepplin glitch out and take you to Stonetalon clipping through the terrain, having Kalimdor crash and Eastern Kingdoms stay up, having a kneeling bug after you loot something, and a whole myriad of other things I mentioned already are not.
---
The kicker her is you can't explain why one falls into this "philosophy" and the other doesn't. Imagine if I was on here telling you how often the zepplin glitches out just needs some fine tuning so that it doesn't glitch you quite so far. It would be absolutely ridiculous. 
---
Purposely making a game less responsive on purpose to satisfy an appeal to tradition is absolutely mental.
---
In between getting pathfinder finished, I've also been replaying through Mass Effect trilogy. Almost done with 2, and can't wait to get to 3!
---
I'd rather have a girlfriend.
---
Yes sir that is a good one!
---
So you're saying that a 1v1 tournament of the best players in the beta being absolutely dominated by ranged classes isn't a good indicator that maybe ranged are just fine still?
---
Then dont bother with gnomes bruh
---
Our server had a male dwarf hunter with Thunderfury. I never did get the story behind that. He was some transfer from god only knows where.
---
wait, i'm confused. can you use it and then join the stress test or no
---
Fishing
---
Aren’t these the same thing?
---
I prefer r/roundtriangles
---
Yes, I can find objective reasons why something being more responsive is better. I can't find any objective reasons why being less responsive is better, which doesn't mean there aren't any. It means none have been presented to me.
---
He openly says the design wasn’t perfect. I’m saying his philosophy was good.
---
I thought no.
---
Support told me no.
---
Could have been a misinformed support. Probably not.
---
will kiting world bosses be allowed in Classic? Or will you get banned if you bring it to a capital city?
---
No I fucked around with mop a bit but I don't have sunken costs I quit shit games.
---
https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1460/12/1460126771193.jpg
---
they're not really different from locks but yeah the problem is they aren't higher and warlocks are just better from a utility standpoint so there was no reason to bring a mage to world first progression for their dps.
---
nooo, that sucks :(
---
Infiltration successful.
---
Unless materials are very limited in quantity, you won't make much money from just a basic crafting profession. Buying herbs and making pots out of them generally never earns you any real money on bigger servers (the prices even out very quickly). 
---
Stuff like the arcanite cooldown is good, because you can't just spam that craft when it's "worth" it. There are also other more niche markets you could potentially get some money out of, but the bigger the server the harder that is to find, and might require a bunch of alts or similar with other profs to make it worthwhile (like buying mats for leatherworking and then disenchanting the crafted items).
---
If he didn't give a tank a taunt, because he was afraid of homogenization, then his philosophy was shit.
---
Something can be an intended mechanic and a limitation of the hardware at the time.
---
The AQ events being unplayable wasn't intended, but was a limitation of the hardware.
---
The 16 debuff limit was an intended mechanic and a limitation of the hardware.
---
downgrade to a studio so you have less steps to take to the bathroom, fridge when it's all within 250sqft box.
---
So, just to clarify here: you can only come up with cons for it, and you don't think it is objectively bad? **You can't come up with any objective reasons that it's good, you can only come up with objective reasons that it's bad, and you still don't think it's objectively bad**?
---
... So you're a troll? Good chat.
---
&gt; What prayer of mending, is awesome.
---
/cries in ten second cooldown
---
It used to have no cooldown. It was so amazing.
---
&gt; CoH is also good.. come on.
---
It's pretty niche, it's good for indiscriminately healing a raid on the run or something, but Prayer of Healing did the same at least as well for most use cases.
---
They had much better instant/burst AOE with dragon's breath/blastwave than warlocks. Of course SoC was ridiculous in aoe that lasted for a decent amount of time but sometimes things would be blown up by the fire mages before you could cast 2 SoCs. They also had an execute talent and a dmg cooldown with Combustion that meant while locks would outdps them over the course of a fight, often mages had higher dps where it actually counted and was important.  
---
There's no question warlocks are the stronger caster dps in TBC, but saying mage was bad and not worth bringing to the raid is ridiculous. Melee dps had it much harder throughout TBC, and even they were much better than the silly state of meme specs in vanilla.
---
This is known. And I'm pretty sure it already works this way on the beta. Traps and AOEs missing I don't have an answer for though.
---
&gt; Something can be an intended mechanic and a limitation of the hardware at the time.
---
Cool, spell batching wasn't. Which is why like the debuff limit, it was changed.
---
Druids are slow until 20. When they get cat form their movement and kill speeds increase dramatically.
---
Warlock?
---
It also nets you almost nothing.
---
Hurricane was good? That thing sold for garbage on arthas US
---
Makes sense in context. Never seen it abbreviated like that
---
\+1 :))
---
Cylons were the good guys.

Retail is a great game, just different. If there was ever a clean slate wipe for it, I'd probably prefer it over Classic. As it is, I always feel like a ghost chipping away at a mountain of ice whenever I login, simply because I haven't been playing straight for the last 15 years.
---
Playin Warcraft high actually is a really relaxing experience, basically a fantasy nature walk.
---
Orc has 1 (2 If you pvp) racial that helps rogues. Trolls have 4.
---
I'm sure the majority of gamers feel that way, which is why action RPGs are played much more than slower-paced traditional RPGs that focus more on decision-making.
---
As I said in another comment, those kinds of rotations feel a lot more like a "don't make a mistake" game rather than a "have all the information and make the right decision" game, which just isn't my thing (I don't like MOBAs for the same reason, since so much of the focus is on not messing up tiny details like last-hitting).  Whereas I love healing, since every heal (and who receives it) should have some thought behind it based on the situation you're in at that exact moment.
---
It was intentionally programmed into the system, as opposed to being the result of an unexpected bug.
---
&gt;you can only come up with cons for it, and you don't think it is objectively bad?
---
No, I didn't say that.
---
&gt;You can't come up with any objective reasons that it's good
---
I literally said the opposite of this. I can come up with objective reasons as to why more responsive is better in games.
---
&gt;you can only come up with objective reasons that it's bad
---
Again, not what I said.

&gt; So you're a troll
---
Given that you either didn't read what I said, or misunderstood it to the degree you'll come to alien conclusions. I'm not surprised you'd think that.
---
I stopped halfway through Legion, but the fun really left with MoP, for me.
---
Yeah I don’t really mind getting close to inspect someone like in vanilla but I wish the window wouldn’t stop displaying info and then close if they run far enough away
---
Swiftness pots were pretty nice too at least when I was noobing around on Nost, they were easy enough to make that I pretty efficiently levelled alchemy with them, and they sold for pretty decent money on the AH (for that level range at least).

Dang, just replied and then read this comment. Will be testing the MacBook Air out I have on the stress test. It is minimum spec to run WoW Classic, but doesn't have enough disk space to install BFA. Can let you know if you want me to.
---
But... what if it’s bad?  What if they screw it up.. what if...
---
Calling what's universally considered some of the best games of the past decade middling just makes you a troll.
---
Do you suck that hard at them?
---
Intentionally in so far as it couldn't function the way they \*\*actually intended\*\*  
---
If you want to sit and say that a shitty compromise that you're forced to made is intentional, then sure, but we both know that's a really shitty semantic way to attempt a gotcha when it doesn't actually work.
---
Blood Fury is better than Berserking. Throwing and Bow Specialization are useless. Regeneration is useless. Beast Slaying is marginally useless.
---
I never made it I to beta or stress test (yet, hopefully) so I'm curious. Did they implement a button or command to layer hop? Or people use an addons or what? Is layer hopping cheating? If they put in a button or the like, is there at least a cooldown before hopping again?

He left blizzard because he had a kid, and he was having to make too many sacrifices to keep up with enormous workload of working on an mmo.
---
From all accounts he's a nice guy, who answers questions about a 15 year old game open and honestly, and I've never heard him either deflect hard questions or take all the credit.
---
 I think you're the most insufferable person on this sub, and that is impressive.
---
I'm in a similar situation. I play destiny 2 casually, but even that cant hold my attention as much. I usually just want YouTube videos about wow classic instead until I need to go to bed.
---
Isn't that what we all do on Reddit? :P
---
I played both back in Vanilla and I love them both for different reason. But this time, I must answer the call of the elements.
---
Fuck layering, period.

Bring back actual servers @Blizzard

Enhancement is literally the most useless spec in the game.

&gt; He left blizzard because he had a kid, and he was having to make too many sacrifices to keep up with the enormous workload of working on an mmo. He put his family over his career.
---
This is what he says, but if it were true, they would have given him the dignity of resigning.
---
You just have someone from a different layer invite you to group and you hop to their layer
---
Haha y'all are dumb
---
Enh shaman isn't good. But any shaman is good. 
---
Until you hit 7 shamans its hard not to take any shaman you can get. Fore sure up top 6. So if you cannot find a 6th or 7th shaman bring an enh isn't much lost. And if you use them as your nightfall then you really don't lose out. 
---
Ele is more of a loss just because of the item competition , they want a lot of the items casters/healers do. where as, most enh gear isn't wanted by anyone but for off spec.
---
It was a great philosophy and part of the reason people have been playing reverse-engineered versions of vanilla since before 2010
---
Don’t believe I will enjoy wow with a controller

Yeah, it’s just silly to be honest. They might all just be really young though given this is a popular forum about WoW

Fairly easy but also not... like how are you always going to find someone to invite you whe  you randomly start getting ganked or to try to get nodes? What if your quesi
---
Ting with a friend and the ganking begins... you have to drop party and have someone invite you both, and then drop party again, so you can regroup? Seems like alot of work to possibly abuse a system for a moment..  theres probably things I'm missing but I dont see the problem with payering
---
tbc &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vanilla
---
&gt; people always trot out that pathetic excuse... well at least it's not homogenized. Yah, so what? There 's an infinite gray area between zero balance and homogenization.
---
Fucking thank you.  I've always been tired of the absurd hand-wringing over the homogenization boogeyman and bullshit from the devs about *"Well we think that saying 'this is the only class that..." is actually great design"*, which people are so eager to eat up.
---
There are basic tools that every class/role should have.  Does it lack that tool?  Yes?  Then it's broken. A fucking taunt is a basic tool for tanks.
---
You could create a class that can do nothing but RP walk.  Would it be unique?  Yes.  Would it be a useless piece of shit?  Also yes.
---
I forgot how aids that was. Smh warlocks in tbc were so strong
---
If layers are independent and on the same server, you can just log into other layers with alts to double up on resources. As its implemented you have to either beg for invites hoping you get put on another layer, or keep relogging to hope it doesn't keep throwing you on the same one. Even switching to an alt usually keeps you within the same layer. You're saying to make that a click of a button. 
---
We're on the same servers... why in god's name should we "absolutely" not be able to group? That's the worst kind of way to divide the playerbase, then seriously fuck up the economy. Less players on each layer will have very drastic differences in their individualized economies, then overnight mash them together, and you don't think there's any problems that would arise? There's already gaps in prices from server to server, we don't need every server to go through multiple merges overnight. Let the economy grow with the layers instead of throwing a wrench in every cog one month in.
---
I was mainly a Horde player, back then because I was a little edge lord and thought they'd been hard done by (I knew nothing of lore).
---
I rolled a female UD priest as my first character based on class description alone and fell in love with my faction.
---
Standing on top of Org bank after a raid with guildies or chilling at my home city, Undercity with it's creepy beautiful music, complex layout and slime water did it for me.
---
I think I will always be a Hordie at heart.
---
It works really well, I don’t see the issue
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla and Horde in TBC. I will be reluctantly playing Horde in Classic because I plan on PvPing a lot. WotF and Orc resist and even Tauren's stun are just godly PvP racials. They are the equivalent of several talent points or an entire spell worth of bonus compared to Alliance racials. The gnome's escape artist isn't even instant cast like it is in TBC.
---
The Horde's racials are so good that several classes will be underplayed on the alliance as a result: Warlocks and rogues. Yea, it's pretty bad.
---
For anyone who doesn't play Shaman and min-maxing PvP, then go Alliance. Friendlier and less edgy players on that faction, way better looking cities, better located cities, and better looking races (imo).
---
Warlocks were supposed to be able to tank as well, which is why they have Demon Skin, Firestone that gave fire damage on hit, and searing pain for threat.
---
No enh's buffed totems don't make up for using a Resto shaman, but ANY totems plus healing (or 50% of pure dps) does largely make up for having a 5th rogue or warrior. 
---
Think about it, and if you go the route of well we can just take the shaman from the x group... what group casters? Tranq air totem provides up to 20% more dps cap for each member. Thats close enough to warrent taking an enh shaman.  Its only the hybrid groups this changes with.
---
Im talking 1.7 right after the hunter patch BTW. That thing was trash and my entire server knew it.
---
&gt;If I say "I don't understand why you think the number of gumballs in this jar is even" that doesn't mean I think the number is odd.
---
No, you saying "I can only think of reasons why the number of gumballs in this jar is even, and none that the number is odd," means you think the number is even, lol. If you didn't, well... you'd just be... well, you, I guess. 10/10

You probably can't join a group if it means layer transfer if your on a cool down.

&gt;Nope. I was fired. But it was not an unwelcome firing. I was burned out on WoW, and I didn't see there to be any need for level designers on Titan. I said so the first week I was on the project! But I stayed for one, long, unhappy year. I was wasting my time and Blizzard's money, but was too chicken to make the leap myself. In my exit interview, I shook hands and wished everyone good luck.
---
Yea, this guy is a real asshole. With all of his self reflection and self deprecation.

Log off, man. You've been in every thread that I've opened all day being poisonous. You don't know this guy, and yet you've created a version of him to hate for some insane reason.

Remember a big factor to making enchants is sitting in town ready to enchant. At the very least, hanging out right before raid times is a good time to be advertising. You can also carry mats with you and offer to enchant for dungeon party members when they get upgrades. TBH, the reliable money is probably less in selling enchants, and more in disenchanting to sell mats.
---
Things that make enchanting a little better: if you already spend a lot of time in town playing the auction house, or if you play a class that keeps multiple gear sets. As a druid, I carried about 3-4 gear sets, which is a decent number of items disenchanted after getting upgrades.
---
To you maybe. But it's not just achievements in any case.
---
EQ was just a clusterfuck
---
I think you can argue that there's some slight differences in PVP at high levels without spell batching that could throw off balance, but obviously this has much narrower impacts than removing spell batching.
---
The distinction I'm drawing is that some were programmed intentionally by the developers and not considered bugs, and that some weren't programmed intentionally and were considered bugs.
---
SOMEBODY....
---
Clearly a Hunter weapon
---
I been playing alot of Heroes of Might &amp; Magic 3, Age of Empires 2, and Total War games.
---
Ah, that is the perspective I had on it too. Im remembering that interview aand why it gave me the shakes. I dont like the thought of continental layering existing more than 1-2 weeks...
---
"As people spread out more" is exactly what I was talking about with another user up above. I was talking about zone cluster sizes. I think by level 30, cluster sizes will be manageable for zones. If not 30, shortly after. 
---
I wonder if blizzard is so back and forth with it only because they might not have the technical data they need to guarantee when people will spread out. Of course, even if they did have data, there could be variance. And risking a server crash on variance is probably not going to happen which is why they are being so aggressive with the layering.
---
Man... if they would just give a couple of programmer an hour to slam out a detailed technical blue post as to what challenges they are facing and why layering is needed I think it would help answer a lot of questions.
---
I hear this but i am a meme specer and still don't feel this way. 
---
Well people would call me one. I Know that until 40 high shadow as a priest is a worse leveling spec (8-11 in shadow early and anymore is a waste). I know 40+ that shadow is faster but holy is really close, most fail with the rotation (smite spam is worse than MF spam, but neither should you do.) I know that resto shamans are most in demand in raids on Horde,; to the point where if you don't have 6-7 resto shamans taking an enh shaman really isn't a net loss to your raid (another resto is ideal but any shaman is good). 
---
So i am a memer, but i never felt this site was elitist. If people disagree fine, ill try to explain my position and reasoning.  (The other day i was told Horde doesn't even need or try to stack 7 shamans, i just linked him every pserver videos i could find and every single one does that i found.) 
---
On racials issues someone will ask whats the best x. People give their answers but if the OP says yeah but i like the look of x race, most everyone will say well play that then.
---
Horde because humans are boring, dwarves are boring, night elfs are tree huggers, gnomes look like shit in armor and are basically a meme.

It adds charm, it adds some random fun, but I wouldn’t have called it skillful then and I won’t call it that now.

ive been in this boat for 15 and a half years.. :(
---
Because of my work schedule I've resigned myself to not being a hardcore raider. I did it for a while but my life isn't at a point where I can do that regularly. What i can do, is take time from work for release and get a head start. I'm going to push to 60 get gear and world pvp for a week before I head back to work. It will give me a good nostalgic feel without me making any personal sacrifices.
---
I swear to god, I will shove Benediction so far your up ass your never gonna get it back out
---
unless you have a couple max level chars with decently advanced professions and ALLOT of time on your hands, you probably wont be able to jump in and farm 1.6million gold that quickly  
---
it also helps to already have 1.6m gold to flip
---
&gt; that could throw off balance, but obviously this has much narrower impacts than removing spell batching.
---
Define balance in this? 
---
If you want to say that some matchups lose a method to essentially cheat their way into landing a CC that they technically should never have been able to land then I don't consider that throwing off balance, quite the opposite.
---
&gt;ome were programmed intentionally by the developers and not considered bugs
---
We could always just change the word from bug to exploit. You can exploit spell batching, same as you can exploit getting to unreachable areas in battlegrounds. Does that mean we should keep that in too? "Vanilla-like" remember? It's not a bug too, those places were intentionally coded in.

There's 0 daily quests in Classic.

Nice list.

Wasnt there a raid or instance where you had to fly pretty far up in the sky? It was in shadowmoon valley I think. That is what I was thinking of anyways.
---
I really enjoyed TBC too. if they did not do Classic+ Then I guess I will have to settle for TBC. I really hope they take advantage of this chance though. To go back in time and do something different. Perhaps content that got cut and never got to be used due to the direction they took with the game.
---
It would all be super interesting.
---
Human Mage over Gnome Mage because I prefer the human voices/aesthetics and character model over Gnomes.

Night Elf hunter over Dwarf because I’d prefer having shadowmeld as an ability than the extra skill from using guns.

To be clear, I didn't make it. Which should be obvious from the title, but I might as well make it explicit.

Your opinion, mate.

I think vanilla has awesome class design.

&gt; Each role needs certain tools in order to be able to work effectively

I know this sounds like a diss but it isn't... That's a retail mentality. That's not why we want vanilla.

As someone whose having a lot of anxiety over tanking as a Night Elf which isn't min/max this comment gave me good vibes.

Elitism and time constraints—I was pondering this topic just today and considering posting about it. However, I basically concluded that the ultra try-hards, who I think are disproportionately over-represented in this sub, are 1 of two types:
---
Type 1- the person who is willing to make the necessary sacrifices of rl responsibilities, for better or worse, to be on the cutting edge.
---
Type 2- the person who is financially independent, streaming for a living or otherwise has their living expenses covered by one means or another and can dedicate the time without significant negative consequence. 
---
If a person is neither of these types I think they can expect to...not be “elite”. However you can still be excellent. 
---
I freaking LOVE this game, I started  playing vanilla in late 2004 as a 16year old and have had an on-again off-again relationship with it ever since. I will emphasize again...I LOVE wow but I cannot responsibly or in good conscience be as “elite” as so many of the try-hard types. It simply isn’t a luxury afforded to me. I’m a pleb irl and I’m game but that doesn’t mean I won’t enjoy the fuck out of the ride and be excellent....in game and irl...
---
I don't think so. The nation was known as Azeroth, but Stormwind was still the capital and Lordaeron didn't exist until Warcraft 2.
---
If they did it recently (i.e. in the past 2 years) I'd think it's a dumb change of stance and that they should go back to their old way of thinking on it.
---
If they did it 15 years ago I'd be fine with it and would have gone to unreachable areas of backgrounds myself.
---
Said your father to your mother after they aborted their next after realizing the filth they'd already brought into the world.

LOL OMG I totally forgot how funny they look on the lock mount, thank you for reminding me.

I was ride or die alliance till wrath. My fighting instinct was chipped away at by the game forcing a lot of intermingling in the sanctuary cities. Sometime in wrath I stopped even seeing horde as enemies from just hanging around all the time.

Arena Season 3, BC.
---
Chasing druids around pillars was an absolutely miserable experience.
---
The overworld all but died and people just sat in town and queue'd for whatever, only venturing out sometimes to do their daily chores (dailies), or to Raid.
---
The server community died. All of the previous mainstays disbanded and there were no more rivalries to speak of.
---
The server would occasionally spring to life with content patches, but by and large the entire thing was a dreary shadow of what it was in Vanilla.
---
I did a free cataclysm trial, hoping that the remaking of the world would liven up the community, but the server was even deader than before, and with dungeon finder; there was no reason to even talk to the people you're grouping with.
---
I stayed off until Legion, where I played Demon Hunter to cap and found more of the same problems. Up until cap the game was basically single player anyway, even on my new server.
---
Then I came back for BFA, made a warrior; had fun during the pre expansion time with the free handout gear / farming for transmogs, then quickly fell off once the ill advised level cap scaling kicked in. Didn't help that warriors were now, somehow; the worst tanks and not even great for DPS.
---
It's not elitism. It's Gatekeeping.
---
Yeah man, I had a great computer back then and solid internet.
---
These things were always fucky, even with a solid 15mb down 3mb up cable internet connection I shared with NO ONE.
---
&gt; If they did it 15 years ago I'd be fine with it and would have gone to unreachable areas of backgrounds myself.
---
Then we're at an impasse, because I think saying you'd have participated isn't the same as saying you'd be good with them keeping it, and what's more is if you would be ok with them keeping it then we can never agree because it's fundamentally antithetical to any game to allow mechanics which allow you to do things that you cannot do within the normal boundaries and rules of the game.
---
I picked up monster hunter world and I think it will hold me until classic launch, has great crafting based progression and game doesnt hold your hand if you face a monster you cant easily beat. Im 200hours in already and there are a ton of shits who still kick my ass daily lol.
---
That was the joke
---
troll for everything club
---
Tauren are my favourite horde race so making my warrior tauren will probably go undead for mage because it is my second favorite. Seeing as I want to pvp orc would have been better for me and troll for pve but tauren is just best imo aesthetically.
---
I think it's the best option, and should be phased out shortly after the initial rush, a month or so.
---
I do like some of the axes and daggers. But deep down I'm a sword guy too Q_Q.
---
I just think the Human sword and shield melee is pretty meh and they are so *short*. The NE is tall and lean and makes all the big-ass plates look *yuge*, and I like the one-handed animation for attacking.
---
Their 2-H attacking posture is wack as fuck but 1H and Shield is best.
---
As a woman, I can testify that OP is cute.
---
Oh, I'd be good with them keeping it and I'd prefer that they did if their position was reversed 15 years ago.
---
I agree that we can't agree, I don't like random players deciding what the "normal boundaries and rules of the game" are, especially when the developers say the opposite.
---
I thought this was super interesting FWIW. I share the position that batching should be preserved, but now I would certainly support a tighter window on it or some kind of prioritization being implemented.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Population of a zone controls respawns with dynamic respawns. This means you could have a minimal realm population with a local maximum farming high value resources. So no, the realm populations ratio to resources is not constant as it is with layering.
---
In your example that would be having all the players in one zone, forcing a higher respawn.
---
Layering is the same..  fixed number of people per layer.  The more people in a zone the more Layers.  The more Layers the more nodes.
---
&gt;Vanilla already provides randomization for resource spawning in terms of location. Only one node of a black lotus can be active at a time for example. Regardless, there is no reason to add dynamic respawns when a simple sliding window time range achieves the same result. But this point is irrelevant, I'd prefer it as close to vanilla as possible, despite issues that may have existed back then.
---
Sliding window is a definition of a dynamic respawn, meaning the time between spawns is dynamic versus static.  When I say Dynamic I mean changing.
---
&gt;I've indirectly addressed the switch from layering to non layering. It will be a staggered collapse of layers as populations decline. The resource to population ratio will be generally constant as it steps down to the final single layer.
---
That's the assumption there will be a population drop before a layer collapses.  Assume there would not be a population drop, this has been the original ask that has gone unanswered.
---
&gt;No it doesn't, for the 1000x time. Layering encapsulates an entire realm, not a zone like dynamic respawns.
---
Still hasn't been addressed, so for the 1000x time answer the question and make a valid point.
---
&gt;Overspawn code is not the same thing as a full blown dynamic respawn system. It's a sliver of the system designed to streamline questing.
---
If the spawn times change based on the playerbase interaction with the environment it is dynamic respawns.
---
&gt;I don't consider exploiting the dynamic respawn system a good example of group play resulting from it. And this just demonstrates how it impacts gameplay more than the layering system would.
---
If the spawn times of mobs are changing based on the player base interaction with the environment either by their location or actions it is dynamically changing the respawn time.
---
WoW is supposed to be a social group game, not the individual play alone game. Dynamic respawns encourage groups to work together to farm a particular zone knowing that they would not be essentially picking from each other.  Again it is possible to put limits into the system, this way resource availability adjusts with the population.
---
I would much rather group with a few friends to work together to farm some resources in the same zone.  I would much rather not have to be killed my members of the same faction on their alt account because I was taking node spawns away from them.
---
&gt;Why would you expect a stress test to represent a live server environment? Especially when they stated the goal was testing varying levels of population.
---
Literally not having all the players on the same layer is the same as sharding just on a local level.  The community and social aspect of the game are completely gone out the window.
---
&gt;It's not and I never said it was. But if the choice is between that and the myriad of ways dynamic spawns will affect the world, layering wins by a mile. Thankfully they've been working through the bugs to minimize these occurrences. And even if it still does happen, as layer counts decrease so will occurrences of this issue.
---
Still waiting on the myriad of ways dynamic respawns negativity affects the game.
---
&gt;The level of intellectual dishonesty here is staggering...
---
Let me know when you make a counter point.
---
&gt;Again you're confusing overspawn code with the dynamic respawn system that wasn't added until later.
---
Dynamic respawns or whatever term you want to call it were in launch for mobs specifically for starting zones.
---
&gt;The argument is in the first post you responded to, you have yet to provide a sound counter argument against it.
---
Still waiting.  All we have so far is you saying that layering is a negative impact to the game, but far less than Dynamic respawns, yet you haven't made a point why. In fact you said some problems can be fixed with it.
---
&gt;First off, they won't have limitless layers. They will likely either have the number of layers needed to support targeted populations in the starting zones upon launch and then quickly collapse those as people spread out. Or they will have set populations for each layer and create them as demand requires for launch.
---
Layers have a fixed range of people on them.  This is why in stress tests and in the beta you switch Layers randomly, you are not bound to a particular layer.  The more players the more Layers.  The more Layers the more nodes.  The more nodes the more resources in the economy.
---
In one breath you are saying Layers are realm wide, in the next you say they are zone specific.
---
&gt;In either case, a CCU of 6k will likely have 3-10 layers on launch day and quickly stabilize around the 3 layer mark once players spread out. Even at the suspected 15k CCU number people have been throwing around that's still only 8 - 30 layers.
---
&gt;And again, these layer merges will be staggered as population levels drop so that the layer count to total CCU ratio will likely be relatively constant. I'd expect they have a CCU value range they want all layers to achieve, merging when they drop below that range.
---
Assumes a population drop prior to a layer collapse.  You have **never** addressed the core point if a population doesn't drop how will it supports the same level of population after layering.   I don't know if I can make it more basic than this.
---
&gt;I know its hard to comprehend even simple ideas at your level, but keep trying.
---
Still waiting for a response to the above.
---
&gt;&gt;You know that dynamic respawns were in Vanilla for mobs... I mean if dynamic respawns are such an impact to the game wouldn't blizzard remove them from retail? Why were they in Vanilla. I thought you wanted no changes?
---
&gt;Blizzard has spent time designing retail to work around dynamic spawns. There is a big difference between tacking it onto a system it will break and designing the game to function with it.
---
This is exactly what they have done with Sharding. Tacked it on to a system that doesn't normally have it.  All this assumes they fix the error and bug they have with layering which are outrageous.  In the stress test I was randomly getting group loot and drops while never being in a group in the first place.
---
&gt;Whats even worse is the logical hole you've put yourself in. If you were to assume a dynamic respawn system was part of vanilla then the problems that existed during vanilla occurred with it. So by your own argument, dynamic respawns isn't an effective solution to the problems classic faces.
---
Reading and comprehension is an important skill to have.  
---
Dynamic respawns were in Vanilla.  
---
They were in limited use. 
---
They have been successfully used on private servers to deal with a larger population not only through leveling but at end game stages.  
---
This should be used to create and support higher population realms rather than force a player base kill off.
---
&gt;Way to go, you played yourself.
---
Let me know when you get your thoughts on order.
---
A mix between aesthetics, lore, and personal preference. I don’t plan on being the best tank, dps, or healer - I’m just going to try to have a blast playing. I know I’ll be spending a lot of time leveling, so I want to have a pleasant experience while doing so!
---
He designed a record breaking, genre defining game.  What have you done lately?  
---
It's pretty pathetic to shit on someone who did something you could never achieve yourself.
---
You tryna get exalted with the machine elves, orc?
---
They stole it from d&amp;d
---
I remember it being a thing about as much as it is in retail now.
---
game was better after he was fired
---
But what if I’m a rept... it’s ok, human it is.
---
nerf bat
---
So...arenas?
---
If you think a forced compromise different to what you actually would have liked to do based on hardware is intended then we have different definitions of intended.
---
If I want to go to the shops to buy bread, and I drop and lose some of my money along the way and have to instead buy a cheaper shittier bread. Then it would be bizarre to suggest I intended to buy the cheap shitty one.
---
I think this is a pretty cool idea. Obviously you can replicate the same thing in an arena but that's a lot of effort and people very rarely bother with, whereas if you make the ability to duel 2v2 it would definitely become a 'thing' people would regularly do and practise.
---
There is only Horde in my selection screen. Always been like that.
---
I can’t game without being naked
---
No. Did you read the post?
---
Glad you could make it, Moizt.
---
There's really no game breaking racial on alliance. Min maxers are always a little rabid, but find a group that advertises LF tank (human only). Never gonna happen. And the whole weapon specialization thing, while nice, is really only of benefit when dps are fed exceptionally geared. Threat is the nicest problem to have.  Most guilds *wish* they had that problem. But Alliance also has paladins with Blessing of Salvation, so who cares anyway?
---
Besides, night elves flip when they jump, and that is fucking OP.
---
This includes everyone right?
---
I think a lot of gamers who could afford it went to broadband earlier than that.  I remember the shift in 250+ ms latencies in my Counter-Strike matches as time went on, when I switched to WoW in 2005 the majority of people in Counter-Strike servers I ran into were on broadband versus when I started playing in 2000.
---
Racials balance in classic is not a thing I'm afraid, but since you go horde I guess you already know that :)
---
You are the kinda guy that I’m going to guess isn’t going to hit max level as an undead rogue and go back to play your retail enhancement shaman. 
---
There is clearly threat in both games. The fact that there is a specific affix in a specific instanced area of the world should say more than enough that blizz caught themselves slipping with tank threat.
---
microtransactions macrotransactions no classic sub
---
I don't think anyone cares, long as you don't try to decide what's fun for everyone else by ruining their groups.
---
Those troll reporters getting out of hand! Taking pictures in a church how dare you?!
---
If you want to 2v2 go to gurubashi

**Looking for a** Raiding and PvP guild
---
**Region:** EU
---
**Faction:** Alliance
---
**Server Type:** PVP
---
**Times Available:** flexible timing schedule
---
**Roles in Order of Preference**: Tank OT&gt; Tank MT &gt; DPS
---
**Experience:** I played a Warrior for about 14 years at a high level in both PvE and PvP. Am very confident in my skills aswell as my game knowledge of mechanics and whatnot. I have no experience in Vanilla raiding which I find exciting as it will be quite new to me however I have done quite abit of MC back in the day as DPS. I am really interested in PvP and thus a guild that is up to premade BGs etc will be a huge plus for me.
---
As last words, Am really interested in hanging around with a bunch of nice mature average skilled players over uber l33t toxic skilled players. All about positive vibes and no toxicity will ever be tolerated.
---
**Contact Info:** Please feel free to contact me on Reddit or Discord "Smogel#9812"
---
No need, "group duels",  like 1v1 but with a group. Sounds like arenas to me.
---
But why ask a community that doesnt care about additional content.
---
I'm for layering.   
---
In the absence of layering, the first days and weeks would be a chaotic, frustrating mess for all involved and many fewer people would end up playing Classic Wow long term.
---
And with any other solution that group wouldn't even be available to you, because they'd be on the wrong server/subserver. You're also not constantly leaving and joining other groups every 30 seconds...
---
Arcane was kinda competitive with the other specs, but only with the Tier 5 bonus. Without it, Arcane simply wasn't as good as the others.
---
And one could argue that it's different than how it was in Vanilla, for better or worse, since it's harder to really hybridize it with Frost or Fire like it was commonly used for in Vanilla for those great cooldowns, and Arcane Missiles was still neglected, so the entire spec was switched to be based around one single spell that never even existed before TBC: Arcane Blast.
---
Well, I made a lot more changes for compatibility since I made this thread but I'm still not in the beta so I can't say for sure. But anyway, even if it doesn't, I think it's close enough that I'll make it work within one day after the release.
---
Arena’s involve cross-realm, zoning out of your zone to an instance, seasons with rewards, etc. I’m suggesting the ability to initiate a duel with a party.
---
Lmao your comment makes me  want an addon that announces If someone interrupts a 1v1 using wwe announcers.
---
Smooth? Yes, but also nothing of brown and orange scenery for those 40 levels.
---
You'll definitely be able to join the group, you just won't phase into the other layer. The same is already happening on retail in certain situations, no reason they handle this differently.
---
I was Horde in Vanilla. I am thinking to play Priest, I will either go undead female or human female.
---
No one cares or is gonna read this, but here we go. There are three main reasons I am going alliance and always will.  
---
I am a WC3 fan and of all the races, Night Elves resonated with me deeply. (Illidan was cool as fuck) Humans were meh. (dwarves were cool tho). Nagas were okayish. Undead were kinda cool, but also a weird mixture of filth and order, wouldn't want to part of that fanatical bunch tbh. And Orcs were always presented like this tragic, cry-me-a-river 'honor bound warrior tribe', but were really just stupid homoerotic brutes, with the possible exception of Blizz's poster child - Thrall. Troll and Tauren units were nice and chill. Orcs also cut down 10 000 units of wood in Ashenvale for no good reason really and its something I cant forgive to this day. And the last part is, in Vanilla WoW, while the Forsaken are the coolest race, there is so many strange things about them, about how they join Horde and the whole strategic / diplomatic landscape is so inconsistent and looks like a deux ex-machina'ish (almost-as-if-Blizz-loved-one-faction-more cough cough) and I just cant play such a faction.   
---
So in summary:  
---
1. Fuck Orcs
---
2. Fuck Orcs
---
3. Fuck Orcs.
---
Imagine trying to flex and fucking up this bad.
---
Bandwitdh isn't even the fucking issue you moron.  56k modems had hardly any extra overhead compared to other connections at the time.  
---
What mattered was the quality of the line you were using.  I used to play SC1 over asymmetric satellite internet.  
---
It had ~80ms upload and 2800 ms dl latency iirc.
---
It is difficult to coordinate this in a world PvP setting where anyone can jump in and gank someone during the duel.
---
I know they'll eventually make TBC Classic an option.
---
I'm going there when it happens.
---
I really do want to do Vanilla again though!
---
I can’t wait to Berserking Mind Control Alliance at the lumber mill. Now *that’s* fun.
---
I mean you said Elves and Gnomes are basically humans.
---
Dwarves maybe but Elves and Gnomes?
---
Elves and Gnomes are as much "human" as Trolls and Orcs are.
---
Good that's the point.
---
I played plenty of 1.5 and 1.6 as well. People tended to choose servers based on the best latency they could get.
---
I lived in a Dallas suburb and played on a server in Dallas. Almost everyone who played there was from north Texas or Oklahoma.
---
I stopped after Wrath because I moved to a tropical island.
---
I came back for the launch of most expansions afterwards, but always only played for a few weeks or a couple of months with relatively little raiding. 
---
While I played hardcore since Vanilla, for me, WOTLK was the peak of WoW development, the best compromise between quality of life changes, raid quality, class distinctiveness and so on.
---
Wotlk Nax was crap, of course, but the rest of the raids were excellent. I even liked the crusader raid. 
---
I think that today there is also the increasing problem that WoW has fallen too far behind what we expect a modern game to look like in terms of its graphics.
---
Oh hey ground.
---
title should be changed to 
---
smelly beast avenges his brethren
---
Before other people respond to this guy...just look at his name.
---
We can agree to disagree. In TBC, they began removing many of the weaknesses of classes that defined classes. Warriors get selfhealing and spell reflect for instance. This began the "arms race" that we have today where everyone has an answer to everything.
---
Not every class needs to be good at every individual thing. That is what defines a class. Classic delivered this in spades.
---
I’m not following. What is the point?
---
Compared to some BoE epics it's downright cheap.
---
Not only does it sound like arenas, because it's very similar, its actually possible to do it in vanilla. In the arena. Weird eh? That it sounds like the places where you can actually do it?
---
#OKAY, BUT CAN WE GET BACK TO FOCUSING ON HOW SHITTY LAYERING IS
---
I don't RP at all so the 2 factions are just team red and team blue to me.
---
so swapping back and forth was no issue.
---
UA was a godsend back in TBC while farming Scryers/Aldor rep. I made it to Exalted insanely fast farming those blood elves in Netherstorm. I would literally dot everything in sight, put UA on one target, /dance and wait for everything to die (since the mobs simply couldn't kill me with Siphon Life and Fel Armor up), loot, repeat.
---
I heard y’all raped in arenas... sorry that was bad
---
Even close servers I could never get better than 200ms average on dialup.  It was just a limitation on data transfer, not proximity at that point.
---
So like arena but can be done anywhere? I like that, that's pretty cool. As you said though, people don't take lightly to change around here, they'll just tell you to play a different game or go back to retail. Sounds hella fun too,  honestly.
---
I remember having a really big smile when I tried casting banish for the first time on a tree form druid and it worked.
---
We all know that, I think. It's just a fun thing to think about.
---
I started on tbc as alliance bc of friends but ever since I actually got into the game I always secretly wanted to switch to horde, safe to say I will gladly roll horde this time around (:
---
I honestly can't find a single a hole in my argument. I think I just won the spell batching debate with my expertly crafted metaphor! Thanks for the validation.
---
&gt;helping
---
It is easy to shit on these kinds of decisions with the benefit of fifteen years of hindsight. We all know now that prot paladins sucked in vanilla, and were fun and effective in TBC once they got a taunt, the ability to get uncrushable, mana regen from being healed, talents that did not require being crit to activate and all that good stuff.
---
But I do not think that was obvious to everyone back when he made those decisions. WoW was very much a work in progress throughout the vanilla era because they were still figuring out how to make a good MMORPG.
---
&gt; Fear Ward
---
Is it a Dwarf racial though? A quick glance online says its a priest spell.
---
I'm one of those idiots. Fortunately I can't nolife it this time so I'll stick with that 35 on round 2.
---
I agree. As long as the macro environment of classic remains true and intact. The micro environment can easily be improved upon to the extent that it doesnt affect the macro.
---
And go buy a wow token if you have the gold and get the $15 credit. Boom, first month free!
---
Why not bring back 1.1 talents, skills, items, quests and a whole bunch of other things? I have no idea. It seems like people are just protecting whatever the flying f blizzard decides to implement like it's exactly the way it was.
---
We aren't getting pure vanilla. Not even close. #ONLYAMODERATEAMOUNTOFCHANGES woooo!
---
Streamsniping isn't the same as what me and vagrant_savant were trying to say.  
---
What you do (open stream and go to their location to gank) is tame. It's completely ordinary.  
---
Other people stalk them in order to inconvenience. They follow their social media (twitter/instagram/facebook/whatever) to find out exactly what their plans are and how best they can ruin them. They follow and watch the streams religiously every day they are online to ruin it or at least be as much of an annoyance as possible.
---
Every Priest gets a race specific abilityl. No other class has this. Dwarf priests get Fear Ward.
---
That was pretty good!
---
Hey can you send me a link to the thread you're fighting for 1.1 talents and items in? I can't seem to find it, in your history. It has to be there tho... If you're fighting so hard for something like this...
---
I mean, it's WoW Classic. We want to play an MMO the way they used to be made because the ones out now are lame. So no, a lot of is haven't played more recent MMO games.
---
If you like the way they're made now, maybe you should stick with BFA.
---
No they got rid of tank threat as a mechanic because there was nothing skilled about watching an addon. It was a needless thing that is countered by not attacking. 
---
But hey. I play retail. We don’t know how to do that apparently. That’s going to be some crazy new thing.
---
A week of long queue times is better than week[s] or month[s] of decohesion during the important formative period of a server's lifetime.
---
If it's that big of a deal, a mild incarnation of dynamic respawns to alleviate the issues with higher per-realm populations would be far less detrimental than instance-based load balancing (sharding, layering, etc).
---
'Nuff said.
---
Just trying to spark some conversation here. Where the spergs at? Tell me I'm wrong please. I wont call you a racist. promise.
---
Also farmed it on my Warrior post-vanilla. 
---
Once LK was on farm you bet your ass I tanked the fight with the might of Thunderfury and laughed like a manic because I thought I was *really* fucking badass.
---
I don't think it's that big of a deal. For some of the minor racial differences, all it takes is a single piece of gear to make up the difference. 
---
If I don't pick the correct race, howany fewer raid boss kills will I get? How many more wipes will that cause?
---
Why on earth would I want 1.1
---
I mean, I play Dwarf Paladin, and I'm finding it hard to dispute this claim.
---
Ah I see, that makes sense. I can see why thats OP.
---
Because it's blizzlike and was in vanilla. Just like spellbatching and leeway
---
They did so they can kill the trogg invasion of their capital city
---
It's a big investment just to get to 300. Not only is enchanting nearly useless leveling up, you will need to camp multiple vendors with limited stock recipes that many will counter-camp to try and resell on the AH (Arcanite Rod is the biggest example). Getting the recipes people are willing to pay for will also cost well over 1000 gold, more on a fresh server.
---
Enchanting requires the same kind of customer service you might have at any normal job working for tips. You'll get plenty of entitled idiots who argue with for 10 minutes while you hold their mats because they refuse to tip more than 20 silver for the recipe you payed 200 gold for.
---
It's a moderate amount of money at best, that requires you to spend literally hours at a time standing in one spot of a major city spamming /yell.
---
You always hear stories of the lucky enchanter who got the server first +30 Spell Power and hit the gold cap or whatever but just remember not only does your guild need to win the lottery and get the first few drops, you also only have about 20 seconds to explain to everyone why YOU should get it over the other 5 enchanters in the raid.
---
99% of the time it's inferior to most other gold farming methods that require you to actually do stuff. But if you enjoy afking in town and spamming chat while you jack off or something on your second monitor, maybe it will make up for having to go months without your epic mount.
---
I still do
---
So was 1.12
---
&gt;Blood Fury is better than Berserking.
---
Rogues happen the be the only class that is true for. Which is why that's the 1 racial I said orcs have for rogues. 
---
&gt;Throwing and Bow Specialization are useless.
---
The extra chance to hit it gives can make some clutch saves in dungeons and tightly packed areas when picking off fleeing mobs before they pull adds.
---
&gt;Regeneration is useless. 
---
If you stack enough spirit it greatly reduces downtime.  So not useless at all as it makes leveling quicker.
---
&gt;Beast Slaying is marginally useless.
---
How many beasts are in the game? I wouldn't be surprised if more than half the mobs in the game are beasts. Are you saying 5% more damage against more than half the mobs in the game is almost useless?
---
They used to want to make great games.  They became an industry leader, and the money came naturally.  Now they just want to make money.
---
YOU DONT EVEN HAVE AUTO-ATTACK IN THOSE GAMES, YOU DOLT. Most abilities are not "lock on" and what the fuck is "true dodging" as opposed to... uh, false dodging? It's dodge rolls with invicibility frames,  just like that piece of shit game Dark Souls.
---
ITS THE SAME FUCKING THING YOU MORON.
---
Low tar cigar.
---
Need all boes.  No one needs a fucking green to wear and if they do they can buy it off the winner of the roll.  There's 0 reason to roll greed or to expect others to, you're just creating a system where greedy people can take advantage.  If everyone rolls need then it's completely fair.
---
I’m not talking about anything other than the validity of one’s opinion to prefer how things were, and being justified in having that opinion.
---
because most of what your sub used to pay for is no longer an expense for them.
---
Searing Pain exists to troll your MT, don't @me
---
Try not playing games till it comes out. I'm not saying quit all together but try and avoid it. I've been doing it so that when I come back to play classic I won't get burned out easily and I'll enjoy it more.
---
I dont think anyone would have a problem with the spells that were on the priority system like interrupts getting put on them for classic.
---
Its obvious that stuff like traps, flares and more were probably on that system, maybe even stuff like the Blizzard slow. The question is, assuming they put the priority "spells" back on priority properly, will that be enough? 
---
Or will people whine about spell batching existing at all?
---
Goiben! Uden lo!
---
Played Horde since Vanilla as my friends were playing Horde. Played Horde the whole way through except an arena toon when the racial skills/abilities were just far better. Rolling alliance in Classic due to racials and to see the other side.
---
In what way did it add anything other than reaction/timing? It didn't add any sort of ability to out play your opponent. It didnt add any value to predicting your opponents next move and acting before them. It didn't add any value at all. To use another metaphor its the difference between playing chess and playing this game  [https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/reaction-time.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/reaction-time.html) .  One is reactive, strictly. The other requires planning, preparation, prediction, thinking ahead of your opponent.
---
To be fair, all Humans really need over Night Elves is weapon skill. Shit's way overpowered. While Edgemaster's is fine for Fury, wearing Low Level Mail is less than ideal for Protection, which also really appreciates the skills. 
---
Also, Shadowmeld is so much better when you have Mind Control to go with it. 
---
But seriously dude, personal knowledge performance trumps all that. The tip top 1% where every tiny thing matters is irrelevant to almost everybody and wholly unnecessary to play well and enjoy the game.
---
A lot of his chat eats up the negative shit.
---
Live &amp; die by the wills of the mob. 
---
That said, some of his talks are informative/great, some of them suck.
---
Yeah I thought Blizzard was a charity???
---
It was added with the BfA pre-patch. It's not a blanket scale and there are still limits. For example, a level 10 character can't quest in Outland because the mobs will still be level 60+. But, whereas before each zone had a specific level bracket, now every zone has a level cap of 80. The same basic idea applies to every other zone/continent as well. Mobs in Elwynn Forest scale from 1-20, mobs in Westfall scale from 10-60, mobs in Redridge scale from 15-60, the list goes on.
---
&gt;I’m not talking about anything other than the validity of one’s opinion to prefer how things were
---
Exactly. Thank you. So why aren't you also fighting for 1.1 talents since some people would also prefer them and they were how things were?
---
Yes.
---
im fillin the time with xcom 2. just got off steam sale, should hold me for like...a week ;_; please send classic soon
---
Yes they did. Before the Fun-police crack down that is.
---
That sounds terrible. Like completely ruins world immersion. Oh well I won't likely play any of their new xpansions anyway.
---
I’m not fighting for 400ms spell batching, so why would I be fighting for 1.1?
---
Ah shit, guess I'm gonna be that guy. 
---
Can't believe some people are just now realizing that retail is terrible. Mind blown each and every time. But hey, I guess I can't completely fault people for trying to hold on to something they love.
---
Yeah but it's like comical anger. That's why so many people find it so funny
---
And yes I'm trolling with the racism bit. But I'm actually genuinely curious as to what you think it added.
---
&gt; And still didn't back up your claim.
---
I'm not interested in wasting time arguing something so obvious with some pedantic jackwad on Reddit.
---
By their very nature, MMOs require persistence.  To suggest otherwise is so asinine that I feel like the only appropriate response is to mute this and stop typing this mid senten
---
true, if you got some time to spare you can solo just about anything outdoors
---
Honestly, a fresh everything WoW-type game from them would be amazing. Probably not a popular opinion considering what sub we're in but as much as I love Vanilla/TBC, a new world/game (that is done in the same spirit/design philosophies as the original game.. not retail) would be great. Give us World of Starcraft or whatever, just rehire or get tutelage from the original WoW devs.
---
You don't gouge a blink with reaction times you do it by predicting the blink which is absolutely out playing them.
---
You can use the old one for work?
---
God, I'm feeling just like you!
---
Everything else just pales in comparison right now.  But WoW Classic....this is Monumental!  This is the start of something big.  This is the return of Azeroth.
---
I completely took for granted just how great the game still was when I began playing in 08.  Who knew that the game would change so much, so quickly, and that WoW would go from being a shining example of an MMO - to only the newest content mattering.
---
&gt; The real intra-server decohesion is having more than 3000 players in a single server concurrently all able to interact with one another like many popular private servers have gotten to.
---
That's not what that means.
---
I just follow the tank and heal.
---
That's why maximum bets are a thing.
---
Every time I took the boat to the other continent, I'd go below deck and lie down on the bed.
---
I played barley in wrath, first max in cata and every expansion since for the sake of exploring new zone. I played a private vanilla server and instantly from level 1 it feels like every bit of xp is earned every item is valuable and skills are meaningful, it feels like the world is actually a world that i want to explore and my gosh there is so much of it. levelling first time to 85 felt good i felt i acheived something but its nothing compared to 1-60 canilla bcor wrath. i want to feel like after i level and get gear mounts whatever it will actualy be considered good and people will be jealous but in a good way because i used to see cool looking gear on players and think "i wish i can look like that one day" and i would know im weeks even months of ever getting a single piece like what i just saw but i knew everyone was equal in the world, of warcracft and i had a chance.
---
Blizzards also very good about offering free game time upon request.  There has probably been 4-5 patches where I asked for game time to try out the new patch and they gave me 3 days.
---
[&lt;GET OUT OF MY FOREST&gt;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3dYizmLtA0)

Because you and your vast network of friends are going to strategically make sure to get set up on separate layers and then not group together until one of you gets ganked by a rogue, right? The vast majority of people aren't going to be able to layer hop as easily as you think they are.
---
Universally. AHAHAHAH. It's a bunch of obnoxious fantards like yourself who can't stop telling everyone how great it supposedly is. It's all fantard hype. Those games are technical atrocities with shit controls, shit camera, shit targeting and shit story telling. It some of the most overrated stuff in the history of gaming. 
---
Listen, son, I am an old fart., I started gaming back when games had like 40 mintes worth of "content" and made up for it by being really hard. So maybe a kid like you feels special when beating a video game that isn't a complete pushover like the rest of them but for an experienced gamer it takes more than that to be impressed. Dark Souls is overrated.
---
Nature damage was excluded from warlock curses because of thunderfury debuff I believe. They could just double the proc rate for elemental focus and it would solve everything for shamans, for both ele and enh. Mana problems would be solved and on par with every other class, enh shamans could forgo stormstrike and start going for a melee crit/shock crit build to benefit from the 9% melee crit on ele tree.
---
&gt;Have you actually read any of this?
---
Yes. You said this, and other things just like it:
---
"The argument for keeping it is the same as the argument for keeping everything in classic. It’s how it was."
---
&gt;so why would I be fighting for 1.1?
---
Because it's "how it was" in the first phases of content.
---
Go both and gather on an alt
---
Bubbles cousin IRL, dunno if thats common knowledge
---
Started with Horde in Vanilla, but I was very young so I didn't give a fuck about the war.
---
Switched to Alliance when TBC came out, because my big bro said so.
---
Switched to Horde when I moved out of my hometown to a new place and met people that play horde.
---
Now I'm a Horde and I am super happy..... 
---
JK I'm still sad and do the 'Eric Andre - Let me in' while standing in front of Ironforge. I MISS MY DWARF!
---
You could hold off on the pyroblast for 5 seconds
---
Which still doesn't prevent someone from vendoring it. Stopping the group to force someone to do this is stupid.
---
That was true for most expansions in the beginning though. 
---
Warriors just scaled really strong with good gear.
---
Being an adult means you have control over your life and your time so you can actually play for 30 hours at launch. Try doing that when mom is dragging you to school.
---
I'm thoroughly convinced you're 100% trolling.  No one is as dumb as you're pretending to be.  Bye
---
Without SB, you would have balance issues thou. I think it would be kinda broken, and you would have needed more balancing. So if you look at it that way. its good we have it, and P.S also done it.  
---
Sure 400ms can sound a bit much, now i have not have the chance to test is yet, but from the beta content ive seen. People seem to be happy. Even in the dueling tournaments, you have not heard complains.  
---
Imagine a rogue, always beeing able to gouge+stealth.
---
Than anyone? EJ wasn't ranked that highly. They were mostly known because of the forums they ran for theorycrafting. 5th on Thaddius was their only top 10 kill on any Naxx boss. That's a whole lot of better 05 06 players that might be browsing this subreddit.
---
Do you not care that you can't answer my question?  That's some serious willful ignorance my dude.
---
This is a horrible arguement and i see it throw around here all the time. Just beacuse you want changes that would arguable make the game better doesnt mean that directing them to BFA is the right answer. Complete non arguement and a total cop out to extinguish what should be a transference of ideas back and forth pros and cons. The game is already inherintly changed in its form
---
Why not just make the game from the ground up to make it perfectly fit the vanilla experience?! Oh wait, time and money.
---
You go do that. I'll be waiting for Classic. Hopefully without spell batching, but that seems like a high hope.
---
Anyone that is happy to pass will also be happy to give it to someone that actually needs it. The only difference is if the default is *all need on BoEs* then it becomes impossible for anyone to ninja any BoE.  
---
Basically the argument between the two systems is how much having to tell/ask people that you actually need something is (instead of just clicking a button), and then on the flip side how annoying it is for someone to ninja staff of dominance.
---
But calling people racist and stupid. you are fine with. But the BFA meme, yes that is where we put our foot down.
---
Do you like Vanilla? If so, a lot of his design philosophy was shared by Dodds and Adham and so it is what defines Vanilla. The philosophy back then wasn’t to balance and design around raids, something that less than 5% of the playerbase did. Paladin tanks were just fine in 5 mans. I’ve heard that a lot of specs are “the worst spec in the fucking game” (oomkin?). The design in raids was to ensure that each class got invited, which they did.
---
Stack bodies, my tauren brother
---
Shower? I hardly know her!
---
Absolutley im going to have multiple 60s plan on clearing all content etc. I love vanilla with a passion and will probably cry when i hear the music on the login screen
---
Yes. Nothing says "immersion" like having to rename your guild or toon because of a server merger.
---
PvP beastmaster was fun. Enrage cat and let it lose on some poor clothy and watch them die then just kite/attack whatever else came your way.
---
I enjoy retail, I enjoy arenas, that being said I also enjoy of having the option to play classic and retail
---
druids r so bad you ideally only inv 1-2
---
Also, didn't locks generate less threat (due to talents), allowing for higher dps (before threat wiping)
---
Racist or stupid ? I have no idea what your talking about.
---
Yeah its just meme worthy at this point so is #nochanges always has been a meme
---
Your all idiots.
---
Paladins were never meant to be tanks in classic.
---
If paladins were tanks, alliance would have access to an extra tank class that the horde doesn't, this is extremely unbalanced.
---
For a short time they tinkered with the idea of shamans/paladins being able to tank, they decided not to shaman/paladin tanks.
---
However they decided against it.
---
Now to all you idiots saying blizzard are stupid for not giving pallies taunt, you are the stupid one for assuming they wanted paladins tanking and not realizing how unfair that would be to horde.
---
Thanks for the sympathy...
---
Or they implenented right click report without an automation system.
---
I just outplayed you.  Sorry you can't comment batch your response.
---
That's cool, but he's going of memory. Blizzard has the actual code. So if they don't change how traps work after all the reports it's how it was.
---
BoPs are need for the main spec players first,  then offspec if someone wants it. Else it's just vendor trash (or disenchanted if you have an enchanter and then roll for the shard).
---
BoEs generally the same unless they are the big ticket items such as twink BiS or world drop epics. In that case even if it were an upgrade for someone that person would be an idiot not to sell it instead of only profiting of the upgrade for a few levels, so everyone should have a chance to sell it.
---
All of this can of course be overruled by discussing things with your party beforehand.
---
Also, it's not real classic WoW unless you get stuck in the looting animation at least once per hour. I'll be fucking pissed if they don't replicate that very precious aspect of my early WoW experience.
---
I don't give a shit about your question, nor am I the person that's been replying to you. I'm just telling you how I'll treat morons that think they'll be able to enforce anything but the standard loot rules: by enforcing loot rules that completely cuts them out.
---
If you have evidence of the trolls with a chiller peace pipe I'd like to see it.
---
This was pretty standard back in the day :p
---
Literally every stream I watch of him is 90% WoW history questions. Many are FAQ which he patiently answers each time.
---
Hmm this is actually a good thought. There may be balance issues. But I'm under the impression that "balance issues" are part of classic wow.  I'm less concerned with balance issues than i am with retarding game play.
---
"I don't like it so you can't do it"
---
Fuck off with your shit attitude mate. I'm all for changes like this that don't affect gameplay but add fun for those who want it.
---
Some notes:
---
Grand Hamlet became Darkshire after a portion of Elwynn Forest became corrupted from the Scythe of Elune. The forest, of course being renamed Duskwood.
---
"Orc Camp" is Grom'Gol in STV.
---
Stonard and Rockard are still in game. Rockard was destroyed by Humans in the first war, then it was reclaimed by the new Horde but was quickly taken over by Ogres and renamed Dreadmaul Hold (NW Blasted Lands) and later Okril'lon Hold after the Horde took it back during the Cataclysm. And then in the events leading up to WoD, the Iron Horde took it over and presumably it was retaken again by the Horde. Very contested spot.
---
The Black Morass was the swamp that covered the land that is now Blasted Lands. When the Dark Portal was opened it slowly began corrupting the land, eventually making it a mirror of the wasteland of Hellfire Peninsula on the other side. Obviously, Swamp of Sorrows was moved in WoW to be to the North instead of South of BM.
---
The Temple of the Damned became the Altar of Storms which is still in pretty much the same spot West of Blackrock Mountain in the Burning Steppes.
---
You would trust Zombie-client Classic over the memory of the guy **who designed almost all spells for all the classes?**
---
Also as we've seen from Retail Beta tests, never underestimate how many reported bugs Blizzard is willing to sweep under the rug unless the community has an uproar about it.
---
He gets asked questions and answers them from a thoughtful perspective.
---
And you don't care that the "standard" you're using makes no sense and liyerally let's people ninja loot when there's an alternative that prevents it?  Bro I kick morons from my groups so I don't think you need to worry about grouping with me.
---
Lol! Amen brother.  I love the go play retail argument.  I go play retail and then I just think hmmm i miss the community and meaningfulness of classic.  There is no place for us on this world. We can't have good things.
---
The difference between a 100-1k gold epic item and recipoe etc is way different than a 1g shard from some random boe green. That gold can go towards epic mount or class boe pre raid bis enchants etc. Gold has immense worth in vanilla and all group members could benefit from it
---
&gt; Spell batching doesn't let you get hit by it first but still act, it makes you both get hit at the same time even if you casted at different times.
---
This is an oxymoron.
---
Even 10k on a private server distributed over the entire game is waaaay too much.
---
Wha he meant to say was “this is great! Do you have a vanilla soundtrack (pre expansions)?
---
Just tell your group beforehand, it's pretty common knowledge that greens are worth equipping as upgrades actually outweighs their vendor/DE value, unlike blues and purps which are much more beneficial when sold and put towards larger goals. You can do any system you want, but you are in a minority, and you absolutely know you are with that attitude and after playing the game for as long as you say you did.
---
TOO OLD
---
I know what you mean I also use the bed in the Goldshire inn
---
I was just pointing out the fallacy in the logic of "I need gold" argument. Anyone can use it for any amount of gold. Once you say "well I need to gold". What is stopping someone from wanting to vendor items because "I need the gold". 
---
Guess times have changed since 2006.
---
Thanks, good point really. And as some other sad i could still level a priest if i feel like it.
---
God damn it, take this upvote.
---
&gt; I've played every minute of wow with that attitude. 
---
ninja looted a lot of shit
---
15-30Mbps cable broadband was widespread by 2005-2006.   
---
Past 2001 or so, not a single friend of mine was still on a dial-up connection, so I have no idea where this concept of original WoW players all having unstable connections is coming from.
---
Those who were too young to remember must be confusing WoW with Everquest or UO.
---
Realistically, some of retail WoW's more recent launch server issues and large-scale PvP have been worse than earlier versions of the game.
---
Your dismissing the amount of people who just tag out for a little bit while the servers are overpopulated. Most the people I know who played from Vanilla wouldn’t touch an expac for weeks until the playercount died down. 
---
This is what i’d do. Its also why I don’t see we have to add the nuclear option (layering) for a slight inconvenience.
---

What's DMF?
---
Feeling connected and happy with your character is pretty much more important than anything. You think you're gonna wanna invest hundreds of hours into some ugly toon? No way. BiS is BiS, but you need to consider effect size, and race bonuses are at best a minor buff.
---
Atiesh, Blessed Quiraji War Hammer, Pummelers?
---
Even if he did make that much in overtime, which he doesn't you just completely misunderstood simple math, why would that mean unions are a joke... is he not allowed to make that much in overtime accroding to you? Because you don't make that much?
---
Kinda want to name my Orc warrior Rockard now lmfao
---
no.  Slapped together from the titanic failure that was titan.
---
I read a bit about it and sounds quite nice - considering the other answers i seem to be too much of Rogue in mind but i think i will make a druid as my second character, for trying and for gathering - thank you for the answer!
---
very cool. how long did this take to make?
---
"Hit" and "cast" have different meanings.
---
"Hit" refers to when the spell resolves, "cast" refers to when the spell is clicked.
---
I'm playing wotlk till it comes out. I fucking had it with waiting. The only thing that will take up my time till classic comes out it wow semi classic. You're more then welcome to come join me. Leave 18 mage as of a few minutes ago.
---
Fu noob, the joy of classic is the differences, some classes and specs are good and some are bad, that is what makes it all so entertaining, go back to homogenised retail baby wow
---
Overwatch is a masterpiece （￣へ￣）
---
Touché, i am quite certain i can do the DPS to hat least show enoguh rogues.
---
Thank you!
---
I legit believed that you gained more rested XP when logging off lying in a bed.
---
Get off my lannnnndd
---
Frak that!
---
It's also +2 defense, just saying.
---
I agree! 
---
This was mostly my experience in Vanilla as well. And most of the time one of those big ticket BoEs got won people would gz them and move on.
---
the mechanic is grandfathered in, while mind controlling someone and spamming racial slurs through emotes is not in the game anymore, but both were bugs. You are asking for a rule here, there isn't a principled rule, it was unintended, players adapted, it became part of the meta of the game. It is now grandfathered in as much as wall climbing in WSG and wall climbing to explore the world. There is a difference between unintended and bad, and given the choice I would take a finely tuned spell batching and leeway along with the rare zeppelin bug instead of getting rid of all of them.
---
downranking frostbolt was more than likely not intended, which is one reason they removed it later, still became part of the meta, grandfathered in. Mages killing 95 mobs by themselves, probably not intended, grandfathered in. Shatter combos IIRC were due to latency, grandfathered in as a literal central piece of the class design.
---
nice choice of music, what is it called?
---
Tests on private servers have shown that MCP is better than even Ateish.
---
Until you get into a fight with the opposing faction, then it's a pulse-pounding battle to the death. I didn't partake in such things back when I played Vanilla, but this time around I'm really looking forward to getting lifted and diving headfirst into quests. A green-tinged Deadmines run? A smokey Sunken Temple? I can't wait.
---
All greed on greens and BoP drops unless it's an upgrade, then you need. Just makes life easier while leveling.
---
All need on blue+ BoE - if you feel bad about the party members that could use it, just roll need and give it to them if you win. Note how this is your personal decision on how to spend the gold you won fair and square, and you don't get to make this decision for other people.
---
This is what I will assume to be the default ruleset. It's great because the only way to screw other people over is to need all greens 'for enchanting' or 'for an alt', which you will notice right away and does little damage, or to straight up ninja loot BoP boss drops to vendor, which you can't prevent in any case (unless Master Looter).
---
Orc is always optimal in pvp and good in many cases for pve.  I'd argue they are the best overall race.
---
Worse than that, Survival was changed from ranged to melee spec.  The game has gained 5 melee dps specs and lost 1 ranged spec since Vanilla/BC.
---
With respect Master Grundleheart, perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.
---
A long time ago, I was in Stranglethorn Vale. My friends and I were working for the Steamwheedle Cartel. They were trying to buy the loyalty of local Troll tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones. But their caravans were being raided in a jungle north of Grom'gol by a bandit.
---
So we went looking for the stones, but in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him. One day, I saw a Gnome playing with a Star Ruby the size of a Goldenbark Apple. The bandit had been throwing them away. He thought it was good sport.
---
Some men aren't looking for anything logical like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
I think some of the logic is: 
---
This item would be an upgrade for a few levels, but while questing/leveling it's gonna be replaced pretty soon. 
---
The sentiment holds up when the item is worth a fair amount of gold for any party member, and was definitely an argument I saw / participated in plenty of times as a teenager.
---
I liked sleeping in those shelf beds in Crossroads Inn :)
---
You'll be even more surprised, then, that a level 40 craftable helmet, Wolfshead Helm, is BiS for Feral Druid DPS all throughout the game, the same as the level 29 Manual Crowd Pummeler (though you will need a lot of them).   
---
Also, the BiS trinket for Bear tanks is a trinket you create from Enchanting. It is BoP, but you do not need Enchanting to use it, so you can drop Enchanting after creating it.
---
Stock up on chicken tenders and snacks, buy a couple cases caffeinated drinks, download all possible classic WoW wallpapers, order some posters/banners, go for daily runs to get in shape for the coming adventures, running between quest givers can be brutal if you're not prepared. Definitely lift some weights (don't forget to stretch!) then you can move on to some bigger things like forging your own weapons and armor, learning arcane magic, studying the ancient texts of the Fel to learn to summon demons, studying with the druids of Astranaar to unlock the ability to shapeshift, and buying a mini fridge for your drinks.
---
Armor and the defense, which isn't easy to get as a Druid.
---
&gt;Was fun to theory craft the uses of some of these items. My favorite is [Meat Slicer](https://imgur.com/a/fAERq8K). Depending on what the ICD of the proc would be, it would have very cool uses in pvp for someone to equip and stick on a healer. Would ideally be used with WF, maybe even juju flurry &amp; would stack well with class specific abilities/passive such as slice and dice or flurry.
---
[we did even worse, lmao](https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_SRWsspqhJW14S584PHIsCxiKgTUv4dcg.jpg)
---
Jesus look at your poor comment history...how many is that in this thread alone? Go outside dude you’re making yourself crazy
---
This isn't about who gets the loot it's about what you roll.  Why let people arbitrarily decide value and let scumbags roll need?  If everyone rolls need someone on the off chance someone needs a green they can say hey man that's an upgrade can I get that?  And most people will give it to him and the people who won't are the people that would have rolled need while everyone else greed ed anyway.  So why roll greed? What's the benefit?  Don't do it.
---
I'd like to imagine the macro reads: 
---
"If a big ticket BoE drops we're all rolling need. Yes it is a nice upgrade for you, but we're all clearing this together and everyone needs gold. If the item is a big upgrade/BiS for X+++ levels/not worth a whole lot on the AH, let's talk about it before anyone clicks either button."
---
Tanking in BC was far too easy compared to Vanilla. I lost interest in tanking because of it.  
---
Marks hunters were not very interesting in TBC compared to Vanilla.  Steady shot was a real drag compared to the older rotation.   And they nerfed engineering into the ground for arena balance.
---
This is the attitude that led to a personal loot system, and it sucks.
---
That is a good question, I have not really tracked it. My guess would be 4-6 days per dungeon. After the system for the first one was setup the second was easier ;)
---
I... feel attacked.
---
high mountain tauren? more like mountain high tauren
---
If everyone rolls need who gets taken advantage of?
---
 Are you sure you've thought this through?
---
I think that’s the exact reason most people don’t like it. When you grind and level and grow stronger you want something to show for it. Going through old world content at max level with good gear I want to feel like a god bc I put in the work to be there.
---
Rare BoE's are only valuable when sold on the AH, which you can't do once it has been equipped. The money from vendoring or DE'ing is minuscule, noone cares about that.
---
No, that was added in TBC (version 2.0.1) the stones never worked like that in vanilla.
---
I like this reason I’m going with it !
---
I agree with all of this. 
---
Another thing is chests in instances. The etiquette seems to be that either everyone rolls for the chest and the highest wins or someone links the chest items and the party member that needs them just gets them, with a roll if an upgrade drops. I like the latter system better, but both work.
---
&gt;TLDR: Being Pro-Spell Batching is being Pro-Racism
---
&gt;spergs
---
K done reading
---
It might be negligible but for someone that negligible is important.
---
Ha! Used to take me 3 or 4 tries to align myself so my feet weren't sticking out of the box
---
Well he is from the horde after all
---
You can enchant soulbound items.
---
😏😏😏😏
---
Got a couple of dwarven ale in yeh before bed aye
---
Why would you think DUNGEONS will be layered?
---
They still have value, just not as much value. Besides, once you do this once, you can do it again and keep the second item without it equipping it.
---
Could you explain to me what the benefit of everyone rolling greed on boes is compared to everyone rolling need?  
---
A need/greed system makes all kinds of sense for bop items and zero for boes.
---
Level 55 water - but this isn’t in the game until phase 2 because you get it from a book in dire maul.
---
SHAMEFUR DISPRAY
---
Prot paladin would be the worst spec in the game even if paladins had taunt.
---
Honestly, the only trade is Stockades and RFC, the other instances, though they may be run less because of commute, can still be done.
---
You dont seem to understand the point here - if you win a BoE you must equip it so you are unable to use this excuse and just sell it off later - its true that you can just vendor/disenchant it but no one really cares if you do that since it will just act as a normal rare (boe drops are rarely epic anyway) and give you a couple of gold or  a common shard/dust.
---
Thank you, this is really useful information - I will probably go rogue first but i will def. go druid as a second character since it has such a nice vibe to it.
---
Yeah I wanna ninja loot that's why I'm arguing everyone should roll need.  Smart, very logical.
---
I am 100% with you. I stare at my steam library thinking how much I want to heal on my priest. Any time I try to play something else I think there is no point since I should be playing Classic even though I can't.
---
So why are some people getting 3 days for free? Is it because their accounts have been inactive or something?
---
Do you have any consoles? Getting Switch is like discovering a whole new universe of gaming. 
---
Or maybe take a break from games and watch something instead. I for one recently binge watched Dragon Ball Super and One Piece. I usually don't like anime but these two are relatively non-weebish, especially if you watch dubbed.
---
Lmao so true
---
That's how I play.  You can play that way with me, never get boes, or never group with me.  I'm down with any of these options brother.
---
Ohhhh I see, you just buy gold and pretend like your some virtual economic mastermind, while in reality you just keep buying more gold because your retarded schemes don't actually work. I'm not sure if you've even played WoW if you think that rare BoE's drop enough to ever make this worth it.
---
I would argue that queue option is the least harmful. But it's easy to see why blizz would be afraid to just let the launch play it's course.  
---
I think the best thing to do to avoid most extreme launch related problems, while reducing abuse by players is something like a 1 week limit.  
---
I understand you said "up to P1", but honestly if they didn't remove layering until ALMOST the end of phase 1, that'd be significantly more harmful to the classic experience than an unplayable launch event.  
---
PR wise, the bad launch is worse, but I'd argue when it comes to player experience, months of layering is not great
---
100% agree. 
---
Gold is always an upgrade ...
---
&gt; I Thought it was better to get some rep with homefaction in the early levels for the mount discount
---
The mount reputation is VERY easy to get, its only honored. Meaning to your own faction you are going to get that way before L40.
---
even if you had a night to try it out . setting it up is very easy and fast. also even if you dont play every class , just setting up the classes and trying the abilities on dummies will give you an idea. 
---
no worries if you didnt have time , just choose which one feels right or you want to play . and choices are hard :D
---
Wpvp pretty fun as a holy pally m8 :)
---
100mana difference between 1 and 4, which sounds trivial but not when you're being drained to zero by a hunter.
---
Yea, I'm not sure what folks are grinding for gold these days, but most likely you'd also want to be max level, have some decent gear... on top of buying bfa. Probably not worth it. I'm guessing a single token would still be over 100k gold. I mean if you played a TON, you'd probably make back the money you spent on BFA and maybe a couple additional months of subs
---
I've been browsing this sub regularly for the last few weeks. I don't see elitist being assholes to new players. There are some debates between experienced players on the merits of certain things but all in all I think its going well.
---
Yep, I’m a huge fanboy and have been wanting blizzard vanilla for years
---
I’m not gonna be resubbing if layering stays in, unfortunately. I got a great vanilla experience on ely, playing a hunter. I got vanilla with no artificial and incorrect “leeway”, with pets working as they did in vanilla (not legion), and with far less class bugs than classic has currently
---
Barching and leeway both needs to be tuned down. We want it to be in the game because Its good for the game the way it is on private servers where the windows are much shorter so you can still blind a blind or gouge a blink if you do it really quick.. NO ONE wants this broken leeway where people hit you from 20 yards or huge batch windows where you can land a damage spell and chain seduce same time, never land half your abilities and traps not working Lol??? No one wanted that when they asked for batching and leeway.
---
I hope you're down with never playing with anyone then. Good luck.
---
All these comments making me want to play on a RP-PVP server.
---
Because I don't care for min-maxing. Content in Classic doesn't require you to play the optimal race to clear it, so I'm not going to level my character as a race I don't like.
---
imagine getting cucked into playing alliance lmao
---
Doesn't matter when it works, if the item drops, it *will* work. That's enough. It's more important to keep gold out of your hands than it is to put more in mine.
---
I understand the merit of #nochanges because of fear that the game will devolve into what retail is. However, I don't think this change has a slippery slope like LFG. I merely suggest the ability to initiate a duel between parties. No queuing for an arena, no gear rewards, no ratings, no ranks, none of that. 
---
I just want the ability to party with a friend and have a 2v2 battle against another party outside the gates of Stormwind.
---
I am an Alliance player and will always be an Alliance player, first and foremost, even though I have three or four Horde chars by now (that I mostly use for mount farming).
---
For Classic, my main char will be a recreation of my retail main, which is a nightelf druif, and I've played her since the beginning of my WoW days. I just want to relive the old feeling, questing through Auberdine, then Westfall, her looking like she looked back then and be able to play through those old (and better imho) zones again. Group content is secondary interest to me. I just want to quest, get the saber mount from Winterspring, do all the things that I did back then but now actually knowing what I do. 
---
If I'm done with that, I will level an alt. There might also be a horde char in there down the road for me, but my focus will be Alliance.
---
hahaha I confess
---
idk why ppl downvote. It's true. Pserver data is inaccurate and nobody  wants to admit that to themselves.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
If you already have these doubts about playing mage you should probably reconsider. 
---
I agree with what people wrote so far in that there will be plenty of raid spots for mages and the fact that you will always be in high demand for dungeon groups (even when there are plenty of mages to go around) HOWEVER it is also true that the number of mages on the server will be a negative factor. Not game ruining but still noticable at times.
---
So save yourself and other mages the trouble and don't roll mage if you are sitting on the fence.
---
Can we really afford to let that small fact get in the way of some good old pre-emptive outrage?
---
No, why would it?  Quest addons existed in vanilla.
---
Naxx released in June. Tbc in January.
---
You quit after naxx was released after levelling 1-60, left for 'months', came back, did 1-60 *again*, hit rank 10 and spent months raiding from MC up to naxx.
---
&gt; I don't think there's a way for them to get an okay idea of how many people will play based on name reservations. 
---
Well, its not the ONLY data point they have, they have stress test numbers, name reservations, twitch views, beta application numbers etc etc. They arent exactly just pulling server number out of their asses.
---
Well, not much to say about this build, it's nearly identical to the 11/9/31 with the 13/7/31 possibility I posted two posts prior.
---
* You messed with the divine str and int distribution, which is fine. Str gives more burst. Int more sustain. And of course it also depends on the gear, what you get out of it.
---
* You didn't get precision for 2/3 healing light, which is also fine. But don't assume you'll be hitcapped. You need 5% hit in PVP and human weapon skill doesn't help in pvp. Keep that in mind.
---
* Consecration is nice in pvp, but it's not as useful as in pve. You'll mostly use rank 1 consecration to prevent flag captures and to try to find stealthed opponents.
---
* The main change you did baffles me, though. You didn't take repentance (and 5/5 vengeance, but that doesn't matter too much) and instead went for 2/2 unyielding faith. Ask yourself this: Is +10% chance to resist fears and disorients better than a 6 sec incapacitate with 20m range every minute, which also allows your judgement of command to do double dmg?
---
What was your ping back in vanilla? If it was the typical 250ms then if you tried interrupting shit at 90%+ cast time then *obviously* you'd miss as most spells have 2-3sec cast time, which means your interrupt would not go through due to server receiving your request already *after* the spell was cast - it would have nothing to do with batching and responsiveness.
---
Midnight August 27th for you.
---
Even the op acknowledges that high cost items are needed lol.  You live in a fantasy world.
---
It becomes viable later if that is what you want to do. Your bust is great by 40ish but its not going to be better than feral enhance.
---
If your the lucky lock in the raid that can use corruption I’m pretty sure sm/ruin is best dps
---
They weren’t mboxers
---
if you're questing in the barrens and not logging out in the beds at crossroads, you're doing it wrong
---
Moonjuice

Never underrate tb best Place to do ah stuff as blacksmith/miner/engi since the anvil is right next ro the auctioneer and you can Switch between Mail an auctioneer w/o dissmount( 3sec cast?!?!) :3 lets make tb Great again (so i find some mages if i have to Go to eastern...:D)
---
\&gt;wont go horde because afraid of real men
---
kek
---
Yep, as I said if "changes" stop here, well, this would be the best addition to the game:(
---
Private servers are also free. Those solutions would not fly for anyone who is paying a monthly subscript fee. Why should I have to change my name or my guild when we both are paying the same for the same service?
---
I'm playing old games. Final Fantasy 8, Fifa 13, Diablo 2. I technically still play retail, but I log on like 4 hrs a week. Today we 1 shot the first 6 bosses in the new raid in normal in a little over an hour. I was watching Rick and Morty eps on the second screen more than WoW. Even the new content is terribly boring at the point. Probably telling my guild I'm done at the end of the week after seeing the last 2 bosses.
---
have you played slay the spire? if you like card type games that'll time travel you a few days
---
It will still be relatively rare, after all you have to pay for each account.
---
Love a good bust
---
Hey man, just buy gold. It's a lot less time consuming and idiotic than your plan. Tthough now that I think about it, if you're actually this bad at the WoW economy, I can't imagine that you're even good enough with real money to afford gold.
---
&gt;so how many of those 800k will play classic?
---
More importantly, how do the 800k compare to actual physical players. You could have 5 different accounts for 1 player. Chinese farmers making tousands of accounts to spam &amp; grind etc.
---
I’ve literally not seen this really at all on this sub.
---
I am now!
---
Yes. The human warrior who doesn't hide behind iceblocks on saphhiron is worth fucking nothing.
---
Pally is the best aoe tank in vanilla.  
---
And then he goes oom.
---
No you can!!
---
So where? Not talking about AH because money will stay in the hands of the players
---
Jesus Christ, the leeway. Dude is hitting you from like 10 body lengths away.
---
The answer is your system is tedious for no real gain, having to sift through bags, people being more stubborn about trading an item once they get it. Maybe your server had "ninjas" risking pissing a group off over a green item but I have never seen that done besides the rare person rolling need for an offspec over someone needing for mainspec (like a shaman or paladin taking mage gear for their offheal set).
---
&gt; So why roll greed? 
---
It is literally the function of the mechanic to need roll items you plan to equip because you NEED them, and to greed items meaning it benefits you less. This benefits you on avg every 3 or 5 items, when an item YOU NEED drops, and everyone rolls greed allowing you to roll need.
---
Not to mention when you all hit need for an upgrade that 2 or 3 people want, and now you're stopping the run to do another set of freaking dice rolls when the game just offered you a 1 button auto loot roll for items.
---
I am my third private server attempt.
---
First one, I did most quests, I get to 60, raided Ony, MC, ZG and stopped after first BWL clear.
---
Second one, I did the quests again, I get to 40, got my mount, and stopped.
---
Now, I am 32, and all I do all day long is slow leveling, mining, mindless grinding of mobs, barely doing any quests, play without any addon, and simply imagining my self 7 weeks from now, when everything that I will do will be permanent. Will probably quit 1 month before release, regardless of level.
---
As for other games...since Blizzcon 2017, I try to play them, but I stop after couple hours, realizing that reading r/classicwow is a better use of my time.
---
They will have a trifecta of vanilla, tbc and wrath servers, it’s planned.
---
It is known
---
&gt;I admit you are right but I'm going to make another jab at them anyways.
---
You went down fighting sir. 
---
/salute
---
Oh boy, with that nick you should really reconsider wgat you post
---
Savage
---
I feel like it’s important to find a good guild - if everyone focuses on the goal ( be it pvp, rep.farming, dungeons or raids ) you can get shit done quickly, doing the same content in less time. I’d say you are looking for min-maxers who are in the same situation like you - plenty of knowledge/skill/experience but limited time dur to RL obligations.
---
Alliance is the correct decision because Horde capital cities suck?
---
Need = is an upgrade for my character. Upgrades make you better at your job in the dungeon (and outside of it). 
---
Greed = none of us need this, so we're going to see what the Greed outcome is.
---
If you have to explain to the party that you actually need it, then have them move from the system of rolling Need on everything regardless, is just a time-waster. 
---
One system cuts out all the chat (need if you need; else greed) and doesn't put the actual "gold" in someone elses bag. Add that to a a trade window. One is just simpler and it's literally outlined by the two terms: 
---
Need.  
---
Greed.  
---
In my mind the system works great on paper. In practice it mostly works, but definitely doesn't cover all cases -- hence the discussion thread.
---
But I like the Horde races more. :/
---
&gt;would be tarnished
---
You have a really weird opinion about what a tarnished experience is. My most epic and fun gaming experience for any game was the opening of a private server with 13k people online at once in the starting zones. Sure it was annoying but it was an amazing feeling to see so many players from one world on the screen at once.
---
Make a Goblin Character on retail and see what a bad boring tarnished leveling experience is like.
---
First off, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you use a macro.  But when do u use it?  I bet it's not when you first get in the group.  I bet it's after everyone has spent considerable time to get in the dungeon.  If you had told them beforehand, they likely would have just booted you.  You are holding them hostage after you get to the instance.
---
secondly, what right do you have to dictate loot rules for everyone else?  None.  But they have to go by your rules, because you need everything.
---
Third, a lot of people will just roll greed, regardless of your new rules.  You see they're so used to not being a dick that it becomes a force of habit.  That means you are getting an unfair distribution of loot.  You are ninja'ing loot.
---
&gt;You're obviously not watching the stream
---
Of course I am not because I am not a fucking retard watching people that are awful at the game play WoW smh
---
I think this is a fair mindset to have. 
---
In general cases I'm always willing to *not earn* a few gold if a BoE blue drops that's clearly a great upgrade for another person in my party, but I appreciate that a lot of people don't feel the same way.  
---
I appreciate your take on this.
---
day 2 sounds a bit casual, did u have internet problems or what?
---
TBC pservers always die immediately.
---
They think they do but they don't.
---
Turns out afking up in the air in a grey city and doing dailies and hallway dungeons is boring. As if PvP dominated by unkillable godlike healers.
---
This. People are so ungrateful it makes me sick.
---
Alliance Warrior's should learn to stance dance.
---
I figured it would work out since enh Shaman are functional pseudo tanks in Classic. I guess the question comes down to whether the amount of drinking down time is cut down enough by having a fairly high dps elemental Shaman/tank enhancement Shaman.
---
Same
---
I think youre confused about how often a boe green is an upgrade.  2 to 3 people wanting a no value boe lol.... yeah right maybe in rfc.  You're living a fantasy
---
Yeah, most T1 sets are great for PVP due to the generally high amount of stats, even if the spelldmg / healing might not be high enough to make it optimal for raiding. I remember getting full T1 on my Warlock on a pserver on my first MC run, everyone wanted me for BGs after that ;)   
---
From what I can tell, however, most of the individual pieces on the pre-raid BiS list for priests are better than the equivalent piece of T1. But I can see that some BiS lists use T1 and others use a mix of blue items.
---
Cutting chat to allow douchebags?  No thanks.  Chat is why vanilla is good.
---
The AH *does* count. You're under the impression that everyone is just going to have heaps of gold once they get an "epic mount and stuff". Alt characters can be a massive gold sink. And also repairs, respecs, BIS BoE items, reagents, professions, consumables, cosmetic shit, bank slots, etc.
---
Sure, there will be players that never want for gold, especially the ones that just buy it. But for 99% of players, they'll always want and need more.
---
You can dump several hundred gold an hour in consumables alone, especially in PVP.
---
Who said you didn't?
---
Getting hit from like 15 ft holy crap
---
Cries in Horde.
---
Supply and demand. If people are playing the game there will be a demand for something. The better you understand the demands of other players, the more economic advantage you will have.
---
Inaccurate but not dead wrong. CB is overrated either way.
---
None of the money for repairs, respecs, reagents, profession materials, consumable materials, cosmetic shit (noggenfogger for example), and bank slots goes to another player.
---
Excellent point actually although I never liked the pet.
---
It was NOT and intended mechanic, how can you say that?? It was a workaround implemented due to bad latency on most of the players, which was caused by bad internet connections at that time.
---
AH fees as well.
---
Yea. This. My English is bad sorry
---
You only have to be a bear from 10-20, after that you can be a cat which is much more interactive.
---
Zhevras in the Barrens are so poor they don't even have two hooves to rub together.
---
I played ally in vanilla but only to lvl 42 (dwarf hunter obvs) and was the stereotypical noob, didnt have a clue what was going on and in hindsight, ive no idea how i managed to get to 42.
---
Since tbc ive been on horde, i dont hate ally, i just prefer horde. My current guild in retail did a poll to see what we were playing come classic, and we ended up on ally which i was fine with, i was going to solo level a priest and duo level a pally with a friend of mine. BUT.... they decided to roll PvE server, and the thought of not being able to fight the opposing faction as im levelling up ruined it for me. So im going PvP server, and horde because i prefer it and i never did it in vanilla. Better start looking for EU horde PvP server guilds now...
---
Man there's always one of you guys who completely disregard OPs post just to stick your nose in it.
---
Classic wow always had these features, it’s called rerolling from scratch!
---
Are we talking pvp, or pve? Because 100% in pve rogue daggers is meme compared to rogue swords. I played vanilla as well as private servers, never seen a dagger rogue top meters, and never seen a dagger rogue beat a sword rogue aside from select fights like Vael where all rogues equip daggers and backstab. Combat swords with attack procs leave daggers in the dust. Pvp, totally different animal.
---
The discord with all the theorycrafting is down, but feel free to look at the warrior dps spreadsheet [here](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/47501-spreadsheet-warrior-naxxaq-bis/). For actual min-max, 100% you'd be rogue or human...but if you weren't, especially with how weapon skill worked on [not allowed to name names], you went daggers if you knew what you were doing (debatable after not rolling orc/human, but still possible). Because that was then the best dmg output, not swords/maces/whatever. Wonder of available weapon skill bonuses vs not being reliant on weapon dmg for most of your output. This meant normalization impacts fury far less than most other melee, since BT is 100% based on your AP. Any loss on whirlwind damage was more than offset by the reduction in glancing blow penalty leading to higher white damage.
---
The aspect I mentioned in edit, but should have had as more relevant, was for tank threat weapons. Since most of your threat will come from heroic strike, and fast attacks = more heroic strikes, daggers are among the top tier threat producers for tanks. More tank threat = higher ceiling for raid damage.
---
If I'm laughed at by that rogue, I stand by my statement they don't know what they're doing, assuming the only goal is maximum pve dps output.
---
Make sense?
---
[To show effect of weapon skill on glancing blow damage, which is always 40% of your attacks on a boss.](https://imgur.com/a/a60p26e)
---
I even did this recently when playing with a friend. We had a nice place in dalaran to post up in and chat, then log out.
---
I'm going somewhat min-max on my main, which will be an Orc Female Hunter. It also happens to have the best shooting animation in my opinion, so I consider myself lucky on that part.
---
On my alt though I could care less about min-maxing, so I will be a Troll Rogue mon.
---
If i knew i wasn't gonna log on again for a while, id get my character piss drunk and log out on a seat in an inn.
---
I felt the opposite. Classes were more defined and viable in TBC rather than some classes being obscure and irrelevant at 60.
---
He is prepared
---
Lol the cringe is real
---
The only one Blizzard has confirmed is realm transfer, but they've also NOT confirmed that the others *won't* be in the game at some point. I wouldn't put it past them. Half their revenue comes from "in-game net bookings" also known as microtransactions, so they have a real incentive to do it.
---
I'm not going "bis" race because I'm not a nerd :)
---
Gnomes can suck fat nugs... I'll be making human mage, night elf warrior because I'll be playing the game, not others.
---
Me too! As a night elf it made it really hard though.
---
Sort of my feelings too. I like how they have a 1.12 reference client but decided instead of using that "warts and all" they instead tried to bastardize a legion patch and implement 1.12 features and bugs to make it "feel vanilla". I dont understand how nochanges became suddenly okay with a completely different game with a 1.12 paint job. I dont understand why you think you do but you dont for all intent and purpose won the argument by not making redoing vanilla but giving so many changes masked as simple qol updates while actually not bringing the game to where it could be now. The cherry picking of updates that provide a vanilla experience like pseudo latency, leeway and trash like that meanwhile under the hood everything combat was legion is idiotic. Then the layering cherry on top just makes no sense at all. Everyone asked for vanilla and they're giving us not vanilla and if it succeeds or flops either way they get an i told you so. You think you did but you didnt, see we proved it. Which I think is shitty.
---
Well, a WoW token is 180k gold. At my time, you would have been filthy rich with 180k gold. So, no way I can afford that.
---
Nice to know, I’ve been trying to figure out which one to go male or female and couldn’t find anything on casting animation.
---
This is my goto copypasta whenever a conversation devolves into insults. Only thing cringeworthy is your father not being able to afford your mother's abortion.
---
Did anyone else stand in moonwells thinking it would heal them faster like in WC3?
---
Eh maybe to start with but I won't miss the same content expansion after expansion... mounts, pets, world quests, flying. 
---
No more do we have to deal with the letdowns of retail wow!
---
"We're going to continue that process over the first few weeks until eventually we will close down, and promise we will do this, a few weeks in, to a single world per realm. No sharding, none of that going forward. We know that needs to happen before we do something like turn on the world bosses for example."
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234
---
Here's my source of him specifically saying layering will be gone possibly by a few weeks in, and definitely by the time phase 2 and world bosses come out. This interview was on May 15, 2019. Please provide a more recent source that has him backtracking on this and then I will believe that you aren't just talking out of your ass.
---
Mass death and destruction. Blood up to your ankles.
---
Well, I would say both female and male undead have cool casting animations but males are hunched and their bones stick out more than females.
---
It's impossible to get Exalted with other races not your own without cloths hand in, which isn't available.
---
You're right. He didn't give paladins taunt. If only you were actually born at the time that Kevin Jordan began designing World of Warcraft, you could have saved the prot paladin class. You could have saved us all.
---
From Kevin freaking Jordan.
---
I imagine there will be queues on those full servers, just like there were sometimes during the earlier expansions on high population servers.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Seriously you guys have been spamming for so long your better off making your own guild... roll horde and let's talk
---
There are more people that want nothing to do with streamers than those that do.
---
At lvl 60: greed for BoE greens (except for valuable stuff like orbs and), need for BoE blues and purples.
---
It's not supposed to be there!
---
There is over 20 languages in Europe and we didnt get a specific server for each.
---
You can hit enemies with staff in any spec as druid.
---
Super efficient levelers, but arguably kinda boring.   
---
Spec into imp wand and spirit tap first, and then do whatever you want with the rest of your talents (most people go shadow, I'd personally go holy after getting imp SW:P, because I really enjoy healing dungeons)  
---
You pull with smite / holy fire / mind blast - apply SW:P, and wand. You shield / heal when needed. Rinse and repeat until 60.
---
$$$$
---
When I got my wife playing not too long ago she insisted we did this every time we stopped. I loved it to be fair, reminded me this is meant to be an RPG.
---
Shaman isn't exactly super interesting either - you apply totems and auto-attack, after level 30 there's a spike in fun due to WF proccing from time to time.
---
Thats the "extra effort" people mention memes have to do.
---
&gt;Save
---
Truth be told from my perspective it seems clients are secondary. Thats just what you lure them into thinking. Its all about shareholders in the end and the quarterly payout and reports.
---
Jokes aside, time IS more valuable than money....
---
Those realms will likely just end up with a higher player cap or just having a queue to get into if they stay overpopulated like that. That being said, I sincerely doubt any realm will maintain a population to the point that it becomes actually problematic and not just a slight nuisance.
---
I would guess the server gets full status and players on the server offered free realm transfer.
---
Play on 14"-15" CRTs
---
Sick days.
---
Agreed
---
I don't even like spell batching but
---
&gt;Being Pro-Spell Batching is being Pro-Racism 
---
immediately screams "dont read my post because im a fucking moron" so idk dawg you lost me there
---
It’s not that mages were bad, they weren’t, it’s just that warlocks were obnoxiously overpowered to the point that high end raiding guilds took warlocks over mages because they were so easy to play and did more damage. Mage damage was good, Warlock damage was silly.
---
Same thing happened to me. But it was the elite Dragons that spawn in the Stormwind throne room as part of the Onyxia quest chain. Me and another hunter kited 2 of them to the AH .... Then the voice of God spoke and told me not to be bold
---
I'm gonna roll a night elf mohawk!
---
Whats your game?
---
Is it?
---
really?? ok, i want totem stomping .. it was vanilla, otherwise it messes directly with the gameplay we had back then.
---
It's become increasingly evident you need to watch this: [https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=239](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=239)
---
&gt;In your example that would be having all the players in one zone, forcing a higher respawn.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Layering is the same.. fixed number of people per layer. The more people in a zone the more Layers. The more Layers the more nodes.
---
It is not the same. Layers are realm wide, not zone wide. The only point in which zones might be a consideration is starter zones during launch but that isn't confirmed.
---
With dynamic respawns, player concentrations in the world increases resource spawns.
---
With Layering, increases in realm wide population increase resource spawns, decreases in realm wide population decrease resource spawns.
---
&gt;Sliding window is a definition of a dynamic respawn, meaning the time between spawns is dynamic (changing) versus static. When I say Dynamic I mean changing.
---
No. Dynamic respawns refers specifically to the rates of respawns being dynamic. A sliding window still results in an average fixed value respawn.
---
&gt;If the spawn times change based on the playerbase interaction with the environment it is dynamic respawns.
---
True, if you want to speak broadly. The problem is they are functionally two different systems with different goals and outcomes.
---
&gt;Layers have a fixed range of people on them. This is why in stress tests and in the beta you switch Layers randomly, you are not bound to a particular layer. The more players the more Layers. The more Layers the more nodes. The more nodes the more resources in the economy.  
---
&gt;In one breath you are saying Layers are realm wide, in the next you say they are zone specific.
---
You don't switch randomly. As per the video above layers are sticky and you only phase under a set number of conditions.
---
Yes, more players = more layers = more nodes. This is exactly why player to resource ratio remains constant unlike with dynamic respawns. Thankfully, as I outlined, layer count will be fairly small.
---
No, I've always said layers are realm wide. Might need to read what I wrote a bit slower.
---
&gt;This assumes a population drop prior to a layer collapse. You have **never** addressed the core point if a population doesn't drop how will it supports the same level of population after layering. I don't know if I can make it more basic than this.
---
I haven't addressed it because Blizz hasn't revealed what their plans are. It'd just be pure speculation. Regardless, what difference would it make? If you mean to imply that blizz hasn't considered this scenario, that's ridiculous. They have more than enough data from all their releases to create reliable acquisition and retention models. Even if the models don't pan out, they could still merge realms or split layers off into their own realms. They have plenty of options for how to handle it and likely have put far more thought into it than either of us.
---
&gt;This is exactly what they have done with Sharding. Tacked it on to a system that doesn't normally have it. All this assumes they fix the error and bug they have with layering which are outrageous. In the stress test I was randomly getting group loot and drops while never being in a group in the first place.
---
You realize that a test environment is set to maximize issues so they can get data. Don't expect your stress test experience to be the live experience.
---
&gt;Reading and comprehension is an important skill to have.  
---
&gt;Dynamic respawns were in Vanilla.  
---
They were in limited use. They have been successfully used on private servers to deal with a larger population not only through leveling but at end game stages.  
---
Ah, so you do acknowledge that vanilla "dynamic respawns" are a different thing from retail/private server "dynamic respawns". As should have been obvious, when I'm referring to dynamic respawns I'm talking about the current implementation and it's consequences, not the vanilla overspawn implementation.
---
So going back:
---
&gt; I have; this is the case. Played on dead server back in Vanilla. 
---
Layering and dynamic spawns weren't a thing in vanilla, so I'm perplexed how they affected your experience in vanilla.
---
If you have any actual arguments against my original points, go ahead. I'm tired of you deflecting.
---
&gt; NOTHING else matters
---
That would mean there is no "secondary".
---
But no, in some industries, the client is king. Especially if you only have one client.
---
you are wrong
---
I stuck for what race to go for my warrior, dwarf , Nelf or human.  Human stats are the only think that keeping them on my list.
---
you can show gray quest in options
---
I dont care too much about it tbh, but I think the system was in place due to the high delays many had at that time with modem connections etc. Im from Sweden so I had broadband already in 1998 but that was very rare at the time of WoW release still in many countries. I remember all my american friends who was still on some shitty connection. Why should you dual sheep? the one whos faster are supposed to get the upper hand imho. Im all about being emerged in the classic world for real on a retail server but trying to recreate old code in a new engine to keep silly things like this isnt worth their time tbfh.
---
Then your the one setting unrealistic expectations for yourself. I don’t see how a clean slate will change much - people will outpace you on achievements.. its going to happen.
---
no its not. a 0,01 % difference is nothing. phase 2 will come very close after release. 2-3 months. the average guild will not have 40 lvl 60s after 1month. then it take take another month for people get the pre bis gear. by that time phase 2 will drop and wardenstaff will be a totale waste of gold.
---
WOTLK was the expansion for this. Probably due to DoTs cutting. Spriest dots could also take someone 100%-20% in wotlk.
---
What about

This shouldnt be so low ... Seems mods are horde biased
---
I have some experience as a player and a GM on a realm that was live for 6 years. As others have mentioned there are gold sinks in the game, but even then people are forgetting the biggest gold sink of them all the asset value of the players that quit and never return.  I think that there are not enough gold sinks and I will explain why.
---
In the "lifespan" of a realm there are a phases:-
---
Phase 1: everyone is poor, in terms of overall wealth.  The realm is fresh and not much money has been accumulated by anyone.
---
Phase 2: the realm has been running for around 18 months and most players have a max level character, may have an epic mount, may even have piles of gold, then AQ war effort eats up lots of raw resources, which have an economic value and therefor sucks some money/assets out of the world.
---
Phase 3: The economic disaster point, players no longer have any real costs beyond repairs or maybe twinking a character, but now they can farm gold much faster but they dont actually need much.  Almost everything on the AH is cheep and plentiful, and rarer or required resources are insanely expensive.  People are too lazy to farm mats for FaP they just want to buy them, but nobody out there making them, similar with food buffs, everyone wants nightfin soup but nobody can be bothered to fish for 60hrs a week to supply the 39 raiders that couldnt be arsed to level fishing.  Flasks become more and more expensive as more and more people only log in to raid.
---
People complain about respec costs, I think that there should be MORE gold sinks, maybe in terms of increased mail costs if you send an item, or a higher AH cut if the item is bought out.
---
These are "trends" and each realm I have played has had a pretty similar economy, how classic will play out I have no idea.
---
The fact is from level 1 all the way to Naxx you are going to spend approx 2000g on your skills, mounts, professions, if you are sensible and dont blow money on recipes you can farm.  So in total life of your character you only need to ever farm around 2500g, and after that all you need is to cover the cost of your repairs.  When 75% of the population hits this point thats when inflation starts to occur, but people are like dragons they like to gather gold whether they need it or not. :D
---
I think inflation wont be too much of an issue for AT LEAST two years, and who knows what will happen beyond that point.
---
Wotlk was the sweet spot for Locks imo. Most fun iteration. Destro was fucking sick too.
---
Only 15% of the pop will be warrior and even less will be tank - I reckon go for it with a Nelf wars
---
Can't wait for my minmax friends reaction to my human priest, lol!
---
Fair enough , i want totem stomping back, Without it it completely changes the gameplay around shamans. 
---
/s nobody asked for the retail implementation of macros
---
Same for me. This garrisons system looked like an idle mobile game. The phasing system (already implemented since Wotlk but deeper and everywhere) is what made me feeling that I played a solo game.

But if you actually listen to countdowntoclassic podcast or his stream, you will notice that his vast knowledge about WoW vanilla is based on personal memories, most of the time he has a very clear "general picture" about a topic, but fails to remember technical details. 
---
Also remember that he was a game designer and not actually a developer: what he designed was validated by developers that checked for technical feasibility.
---
For a very specific issue like this one, i would trust a reference code more than Kevin's memories any day.
---
In vanilla, I had a tauren shaman and a gnome mage.   
---
I've then played horde and been with them ever since.
---
Now all my friends are going to play alliance. And so am I.
---
Charm doesn't mean annoying.
---
Honestly whenever I played retail in the past few years I just cleared whatever the average difficulty of the content was and once that was done I'd quit until the next patch (No wonder I couldn't keep a good guild). Why farm gear just to do the same exact raid for weeks on end for stronger gear that's pretty much only useful to go and do the exact same raid I've been farming for weeks when I know that the next patch will bring in better gear which you can get with hardly any effort. not to mention the whopping 30 ilvl jump from normal to mythic content within the same tier, compare that to vanilla which had by todays standards about a 5-10ilvl jump between raid tiers. 
---
This makes progression just feel hollow and pointless which is why they literally have to scale the world and even PVP to your ilvl so you aren't one shotting everything by the time you've cleared the first raid. Power creep is probably one of the biggest problems with wow right now as a result of this careless fucking design decision to have FOUR POTENTIAL RAID DIFFICULTIES to go through all jumping up the item level by 15 each time. This is why from the start to the end of retail expansions nowadays we usually see players health and dps triple to quadruple what it was at the start which is pure fucking insanity and just outright bad game design. A 15 ilvl increase should be between raid tiers not raid difficulties as it helps the game be a more well rounded balanced experience and doesn't make newer undergeared players UTTERLY USELESS compared to their peers who have been farming gear and the magic AP resource of the expansion from day one. 
---
Sorry for the rant, I just feel like this is one of the biggest issues with current WoW and it's what makes me quit the game every time I try to resub and enjoy it.
---
Mate, he's asking about the difference between the price of the mats and the flasks themselves.
---
Yup. Chaos Bolt was added in WOTLK. Destro was godly in wrath.
---
Destro/Ele in 2s was some crazy shit.
---
Aaaahhh.
---
defense LOL. you know 0,08% is nothing right?
---
druids can and should ignore defense. agi + armor + hit is all you need.
---
If you don't care about threat and you're armor capped then I'm not sure what you're tanking. You aren't MT cause otherwise you'd be still caring a little about threat. If you're armor capped you are probably horde because alliance is not that consistent for easy armor cap. If I was wanting something for that (sorta weird) hypothetical I'd go with Draconic Maul. Crit is better for rage gen and will do more dps and only loses you a few hundred hp which will not matter at all. Maybe you're thinking specifically patchwerk soaking and I guess that could be a thing... but if you have MoM you have Naxx on farm.
---
Best comment since this sub was created.
---
Those bis lists are calculated from non stop healing using rank 2 heals, most fights in Molten Core are not like that. There is so much dispelling in MC, both on trash pulls and boss fights. + heal does nothing for your dispels. Mp5, spirit and int are far more important stats for alot of the things you are doing in MC if you want as fast as possible clear. That is why T1 is very good for MC (and it has decent fire res as a bonus as well).
---
Hybrid specs in general died off. Hybrids like druid 1/29/21 or paladin 20/x/x etc etc all lost value when specs became deeper and more... specialized in TBC and beyond. Also roles became more and more defined from late vanilla til like cata / panda. Such a shame, hybrid specs are some of the coolest to me. 31 per spec points is deep enough and leaves options to not commit to a certain spec.
---
this. Im not sure why people thinks everyone wants to play with streamers.
---
Yeah we're never going to have the experience over again is not an excuse to not provide the game as it was. Thats like saying next time you go to your favorite burger joint they give you a chicken sandwich. Its kind of a burger and you shouldnt be upset because you'll never have that burger you craved again. To be fair the infrastructure of new client is nice but integrating bnet and security measures as external checks is easier than what they have done to the game by a longshot.
---
I actually think there wont be any issues with logging. Not major ones tho. You'd maybe wait tops 30ish minutes to 1h to enter and after that you'd have a normal gameplay.
---
I plan to create characters and accounts on August 13. 
---
I took the next 9 working days off. Which will give me 2 weeks off. Plan to get some serious sleep on Monday August 26th. Even in the afternoon. Then I plan to be awake on the launch and for the next 24h. And then go to bed regularly and wake up in the morning.
---
Dogs and cats, living together, mass hysteria.
---
Is it an older video then? This version, at least, was only just uploaded to YouTube and seems to have better graphical fidelity/recording quality than stuff captured on FRAPS back in the day.
---
Most TBC builds rely on 41 or 40 into a certain spec, which makes builds less flexible and more specialized
---
When I quit retail back in late Pandaria, I sent my main char to a hidden cabin in Ashenvale, laid her to rest, never to log in again
---
Why? Can you develop?
---
We already know that /u/Shiqznima [doesn't understand people at all](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cah4go/i_feel_like_wow_classic_is_saving_my_life/et8q15n/). If I'd noticed it was him before replying, I wouldn't have bothered.

No it's from a private server.
---
Does Layering apply to the major cities aswell ? Because that would kinda suck, not beeing able to inspect people, or beeing on a layer and missing a nef/ony head.
---
Druids are better pseudo tanks pre 60. And shaman can heal as enchancement no problemo he just needs to save some +int / spirit gear.
---
thats \~50 additional armor in bearform, and every single point of Defense is highly valuable especially since druids cant get crit/crush immune and they have to get as much of that as they possibly can from just weapons, accessories, back and trinkets.
---
But besides, the staff is not really all-time-bis, there are some better feral weapons in naxx (afaik one in aq40 too which I dont remember) which are better not just for dps but also tanking for endgame. 
---
Purely speaking of the defensive stats the Warden Staff IS all-time-bis, but in aq40/naxx even a feral tank needs some better damage gear to keep aggro. If they cant keep aggro, then any amount of armor and hp wont matter anyway.
---
Thats in fact a Tauren fart trumpet. Your lips taste funny, huh?
---
You’ll get what the anti-layering crowd wanted all along, queues!
---
Home of the ratatouille
---
Arent they like hiding what server they're going on to sort of trap random unfortunates with them?
---
I mean you're a druid so it's not like you can choose the non-bis race lol
---
Neither the Reddit polls nor the pserver stats are truly an accurate representation of how class demographics will be in classic. Pserver players and redditor classic-fiends are only a small sample of the population that will be playing classic. The casuals, retailers, etc. are going to change things. 
---
I dont think it will necessarily be like private servers.
---
This was self preservation.  After they have a nice Iowa chop they'll soon go to Texas.
---
 Rhok'delar just too powerful.

Im sure these people still have a option to STAY playing on the servers they got used to. Just with a lot less people (and didnt some want this too).
---
Actually, once you have your abilities and your mounts the ONLY things that you can do to remove money from the economy is respec/mail/travel.  All of these things are TINY costs compared to the income the average player has.  Any class can make 50g an hour at max level, players CAN respec every day and still make money if they are willing to farm.  Nobody HAS to respec at all, so that means if you wanted to be frugal your actually money sinks are maybe 100g max even if you are a MT for a guild raiding every night.
---
Two years ago, I was thinking of getting a tattoo for WoW (the horde and alliance sign in one, since I like both factions), because I expected post-Legion to be the return of awesomeness. I have two other tattoos, one for something I'm not emotionally invested in anymore - but I have no regrets of that one.
---
I have played WoW since vanilla, but I'm glad I did not get the tattoo after all. I don't play anymore. I don't care anymore. I have been holding on for a year or 4 to a game I don't love, hoping it would come back. But nope.
---
Layering is not going to be turned off. Layers collapse if under a threshold. If it doesnt get crossed they dont go away. If enough people quit then you feel like blizz did what they said and stopped layering. Even though they didnt you just are on the only layer. There is absolutely no incentive for them to turn it off, ever.
---
Close one, Ted.
---
&gt;Recruitment:
---
&gt;High: Mage, Rogue
---
&gt;Low: Paladin(holy), Warrior(fury), Hunter
---
&gt;Obligatory exceptional players considered
---
This is quite confusing, high recruitment would mean you are want more of them but with the context it seems like you're full on mage/rogue
---
Stack on consumables
---
Thats how you farm Morrowgrain
---
No.
---
But how is that dangerous?
---
During Nostalrius I was addicted to weed &amp; WoW, I leveled a warrior from 1 to 60 while being high the entire time. It was an amazing experience, would do it again but unfortunately it takes a big hit on your social life.
---
LMFAO and would you care to explain your reply?
---
i'm playing underlords its pretty fun
---
I knew someone was sleeping in my bed!
---
I already have.
---
think top post here was simple screenshot from south park wow episode... talk about low effort "meme"
---
Priest is the best out of the three:
---
1. You can go either heal or dps, both is viable for either pve or pvp.
---
2. Mind control is the most fun ability.
---
3. Benediction/Anathema quest gets you a cool weapon for both of your spec
---
4. Each race has its own benefits so you cannot go wrong. Dwarf is the best tho... 
---
The only reason I am not rolling a priest is that I played it in vanilla and I want to try something new.
---
&gt; From mob response in kiting, to frontstabbing and batching and frontloading, the game we're going to get isn't the game we used to play and/or wished for to return. 
---
Frontstabbing was never in Vanilla, only a private server thing due to their implementation, aka it wasn't the game you wished to return to at all.
---
Conversely for batching that WAS the game you wished to return but now not seem to want. 
---
So I don't know what the fuck you want. "The version of vanilla that is made up in my head" I guess is the answer because it doesn't resemble any actual version of the game that was released.
---
That's great to hear!! Thanks so much :) I'll get to work on the next one now!
---
I agree its pointless to bring this up now, but defending Blizzard for ever thinking shitting on Classic servers was a good idea is silly. They dropped the ball for years
---
Play wc3, it has great lore and is pumping me up for classic.
---
Thanks very much erich :) glad you enjoyed it!
---
12x11€ can be earned a single day of work, faster than WoW tokens
---
Not gonna waste my time with someone who has a brick for a brain..
---
I'd love this as well. Or optionally, an addon that is just a list of all quests in the zone, with a check mark or something on the ones you've completed. As you finish a zone, you could see how many you've missed and either go search for them or look them up.
---
Im playing MTG:Arena atm.
---
You think WoW is addicting? Dont step into Magic world
---
I think RFC was planned to be more interesting than it turned out, but at those levels when classes don't have many skills or talents and players were even worse than they were in their 30s its hard to do much with it.
---
learbn tio rae d regatvd
---
On the contrary, classic has finally given me the motivation to completely quit and uninstall all my other current mmo's I have been playing either afk (black desert) or on and off (eso). Now I have \~2 months time to finally start or replay some of the games on my neverending steam library which I never touched because of "no time", as well as doing a lot of other things which ive delayed far too long, like cleaning and fixing a few things around my house.
---
... If only I wasnt in that weird mental state right now and didnt start playing Guild Wars 1 again to fuel my nostalgia ... That might have been a bad mistake.
---
Yeah, I do agree with that. I don't know enough about tech in general to have any knowledge about integrating the features. So yeah, I assume those are the reasons, there might be something else if it had been easier to use the old one. And yeah, I've no clue why certain other features aren't in the paintjob they're giving the new client. I've only assumptions. And yes, it's weird and I probably really should care more.
---
Except for those new macros as I mentioned elsewhere. I like #showtooltip too much. I'm not nochanges enough I guess.
---
But you dont see the whole perspective: no collateral damage but gnomes
---
Great work! Please check the GitHub issues/PRs
---
more like letting slip the reality that is dynamically places you randomly, blizz filled with lies
---
thats not how layering works, thats sharding
---
This ^ They have said they will remove layering even if it might still be needed in phase 2 just cut off and you'll have queues and not be able to play after work for the entire evening.
---
If the pop stays high, the layers will stay.
---
holy shit I thought I was the only one who would go to the trouble of sleeping in beds and hammocks where possible
---
this is literally the most NOT toxic reddit/community, but it seems someone is still crying for no reason...
---
i loved doing that in wotlk when I made my first blood elf, the beds in silvermoon city always looked so comfy
---
With purple lotus being MANY more times rare on classic than pserver expect them the mat costs to be higher than you ever imagined. I expect only the most hardcore guilds will use for for a while.
---
I doesn't ruin anything because it has nothing to do with immersion. One shotting everything including raid bosses because you have higher levels is more akin to ruining immersion than what you are describing hre

I think this guy is using the emerald dream as an excuse not to log in.

(H) Not looking forward to Stonetalon Mountains. Pretty boring and long corpseruns.
---
Are you retarded?
---
honestly if you didn't quit during cataclysm thet latest you probably have some addiction problems you should look into before playing classic.
---
It's a little like your typical Bethesda RPG, who often use the same (or similar) scaling approach, and a matter of taste, I suppose.
---
Obviously, it has its benefits. You're pretty much free to go where you want. You're not getting shoehorned into a more or less specific, linear path. It's a more variable, freeing leveling experience.
---
On the other hand, at least for me personally, it takes much away from what makes an rpg an rpg: character progression. What difference does a level up make, when all the enemies in the world gain a level up, too? You don't have better hit or crit chance due to level difference, your relative damage and hit points stay pretty much the same. 
---
Even worse, scaling might even make you weaker if you don't have scaling gear, too, considering how secondary stat ratings work.
---
It makes pre-endgame progression very... meaningless.
---
In WoW that is of course even further compounded by the lack of player engagement while leveling and the scarcity of new talents and skills (and no skill ranks), but that's a whole different story.
---
I used anything with +sp in pvp. "Nuke them before they can nuke you".
---
Shield makes up for the lost armor from cloth and leather.
---
You need a lot of bankspace tho. You would want healing set and enh.offset for grinding,unless you wanna sit down and drink every 2 mobs, (still in resto or ele you can do +200dmg every hit with a decent dagger and flametounge with enh.gear from dungeons).
---
Before anyone has a chance to reply: 
---
I fucking hate Desolace. I hated every quest in the zone, hated the layout, hated the aesthetic, hated the mobs, in general everything about Desolace can suck a dick. 
---
While I'm here -- I'm putting 1KN on notice, because it's a whole ton of running everywhere and lots of downtime. Also super-super-super grind heavy quests in the Shimmering Flats portion of the zone. 
---
Looking forward to hearing your gripes.
---
That’s fair but removed achievements will never hold the same weight with a roll around. Herald of the Titans for example would be infinitely easier a second time around when tactics have been available for years..
---
Same thing is going to happen in Classic, people will complete stuff a lot faster then previously because of knowledge and experience..
---
The book is a thing in 1.12

Eastern Plaguelands. Always hated questing there. Such a filthy, depressing Zone. Although I love Stratholme. It's my favourite dungeon and perfectly makes up for the ugly Zone.
---
ZG has a lot of great pices for many classes. Problem is that it's probably not out before late spring/ early summer 2020
---
Azshara is the most pointless zone. Badlands is the most boring.
---
Alright. Regardless, the other staff in question isn't out until Phase 2 which won't occur for months. What is the 2nd best available in Phase 1?
---
I've been trying to kill time with Breath of the Wild but it's not going to last me 7 weeks.
---
This was common. Have you never played WoW?
---
I've heard it's because, while the mage specs didn't get worse - arcane definitely got better, maybe even frost too - fire, at least, didn't get better. Warlocks run toe-to-toe with mages endgame vanilla, but were buffed for BC, while fire mages didn't really. Boom - mages are obsolete
---
So that's an argument to *keep* spell batching and focus on fixing the *bugs* that manifest as interrupts and traps not getting the special treatment they had in 1.12?
---
Who said I wanted a rollback? I want a brand new WoW built on the Overwatch engine with all 15 years of knowledge and experience put behind it.
---
Stonetalon has some of really rough rez runs. Anything into the far east goblin zone, far north NE zone, or far west elemental/harpies.... wait shit that's literally every zone in Stonetalon.
---
Yeah Stonetalon can fuck off. I remember intentionally avoiding it on most alts in favour of just grinding mob xp elsewhere.
---
One of the best thing about Classic was the fact that the community was so close together. Everybody knew everybody on a server.
---
Nowadays nobody gives a shit.
---
'Hey, check out this great solution we thought of to make world bosses compatible with layering!'
---
My groups mostly consisted out of atleast 2-3 friends (guildmembers). We used to sell it and share the profit later - ofc the randoms did get their share. They always responded with a kind letter when the gold was sent - and you made a new reliable companion which remembered your name.
---
low level alliance - Stranglethorn Vale
---
Ah, so you think it's a good idea to ask the *current team* to muck about with vanilla as they see fit (under the pretense of restoring the intangible "original feels of the game")?
---
For pugs, all Need on BoE is the best approach. If I win it and it's an upgrade for you, buy it from me like would from the AH.
---
Every single time! I remember having mini shouting wars when my parents or friends needed me for something, and didn’t understand why it was important for me to find a bed before logging out. Thanks for the flashback!
---
To be fair the Hunter does need everything :p
---
*Writes something obviously everyone has done*
---
The easiet comp to set up is a melee cleave. Starting level 20 you can get rolling.
---
Best comp for this is going with 3 warriors (or 2 warrior + 1 rogue if you want), none of them needs to wear a shield. just spam cleave with your 2h.
---
Then you need 1 shaman for the totem buffs (strength, windfury, mana/heal totem) and the occasional emergency heal.
---
As a healer you want to have a priest. Simply he gets the cloth gear and more importantly he has increased mana reg when dealing a killing blow.
---
Sure I have. A lot of people shove cotton swabs down their ears - doesn't make it less stupid.
---
Looks like it was TBC though,  on a 60 twink? I'm confused tbh lol.
---
I think it will be somewhere around a 40-60 split on "people who played WoW as a teenager" vs "folks signing up for that experience" 
---
I hold a small but faint hope that my server has more of the former than the latter.
---
Yes, there is even a boss fight in TBC where this is a core mechanic.
---
Protection warriors. It's not that they became worse, it's that every other tank spec became viable. It was no longer enough just to be a prot warrior and you had your spot guaranteed, now you had to compete with druids and paladins (so a double hit for horde prot warriors) that were frustrated the whole vanilla and now they were really motivated to take your spot.
---
Funny, because I and all my friends actually did quit during Cataclysm (somewhere before the first two patches if I recall correctly). Logged in a few times during Mists to see what was brewing. With the stories I hear of dumbifying core functionality, I am happy we did quit when the game was still somewhat challenging.
---
Yeah and it’s just Durotar 2.0 for us Horde.
---
I don’t agree personally.  Of course they want it to succeed, it’s basically free money.  Releasing old content is not very expensive for them and will attract a lot of people to the game, so just from a pure monetary perspective they would want it to succeed.
---
Also I get the fears about community, but assuming they turn layering off after a couple of weeks when servers settle, it shouldn’t hurt things.  Also, I think having servers die due to not enough players then force merged into another server would be way more destructive to the community.
---
I mean I could be wrong and I understand your perspective, but at least as far as Blizzard wanting Classic to fail goes, I would say it is unlikely.
---
In classic even if there was tons of defense around for druids they still wouldn't bother to actually get the cap since bosses in vanilla don't hit hard relative to a bear's HP and massive armor. In TBC bosses tend to hit harder relatively so the defense is actually necessary.
---
In the same boat here, and it took me a really long time to even realise the level-scaling. 
---
At first I was pleasantly surprised to not outlevel the enemies as fast anymore as it back in MoP when I last played and was actually thinking it seemed like a good change that they would have "slowed" down the levelling a bit since I always faced same-level mobs and quests.
---
It took me until around level\~30 (I was STILL in darkshore at that time) to finally realise that everything scaled... I felt equally ashamed and disappointed.
---
If you're going to level-scale the whole world, atleast do it right and for everything like GW2 or ESO, so you atleast have a motivation to still complete and quest through every single zone with meaningful and scaled rewards. But this is some weird mix where you basically get to freely chose \~3-4 convenient zones from the core game and from each expansion to quest through and just skip the entire rest to never look back.
---
i found a secluded spot, like the middle way up a wall climb and log off there, for the lolz
---
They said there would be queues regardless so they probably have a maximum number of layers per server according to some calculations they've done about expected drop-off numbers.
---
&gt; Almost every spec was usable and without sacrificing individuality.
---
I would argue that Wrath was when that happened.
---
Aha so its a lose/lose situation? We get layering and queues. What a good solution.
---
It's not like druids are going to be allowed to tank in any group I am.
---
Nothing says ninja like announcing your intentions ahead of time
---
JAJAJAJJAJAJjA
---
It doesn't matter in what zones people are. Layering will only be removed when the total population of the server starts to dwindle. At launch there may be 5x3000 concurrency and once all the layers are removed we'll be down to 1x3000.
---
You can use anything at your disposal : oils, potions, buffs, engineering items, stratolme holy water, etc. The only thing that's strictly verboten is outside help. Any interference will activate The Cleaner and that will reset the quest. If I remember correctly the cooldown is around two hours. Not funny.
---
Before phase 2 even
---
Most of them have joined or created a guild. Their choices won’t stay secret for long. But at least one of those guilds is having everyone reserve their 3 characters across 3 realms and not deciding until launch day.
---
Wasn't realm transfer added to the game at the end of Vanilla?
---
No, it's how both work.
---
At a certain population and concentration both sharding and layering stop being necessary.
---
Well that's their problem then. If sitting in queues all day long for the chance of seeing some streamer ingame is more important than playing and enjoying the game then let them, everyone else will use the free transfers and get the hell out of there.
---
Retail bad classic good upvotes to the left

Fix ONLYAMODERATEAMOUNTOFCHANGES+ThatWeLike
---
'need for my alt' was a meme for bullshit reason to take something. sometimes it was legit but rarely. if it was said in chat they would be told to fuck off and come back with their alt
---
&gt; What happens on the realms with popular streamers 
---
Nobody fives a fuck on those realms. If players are dumb enough to play on a popular streamer realm, they deserver layering for full phase 1 and long queues after
---
&gt; and high pop realms with large communities that doesn't drop in population 
---
You fail to understand layering. It will be gone in about 2 weeks, on all realms, except popular streamers.
---
Layers are for concurrent players, I think you are able to understand this. The concurrent player is roughly 20% of the total players of a realm. In 2 week, max, most people will enter "normal" game mode, playing 2-3 hours/day, opposite to 10+ hours on launch day 1 and 2.
---
That alone removes 80% of the layers in 2 weeks. Even if there are 10 layers in Day 1, because concurrent = total players, 8 of the layers will be gone before 2 weeks. That leaves 2 layers (if the starting number of layers is 10, which is kinda high). Add in the tourists that leave in first week, and you will have one more layer gone.
---
That leaves a single layer in 2 weeks, if there are 10 layers in Day 1. If there are less than 8 layers in day one, layering will be gone even earlier than 2 weeks.
---
In general, in classic, you'd roll for the chest, if there was a great item you'd link it to the party and either:
---
a) ask if they want it 
---
b) state your price
---
Don't want to get into ninja-looting so I'll ignore that part of your comment for the sake of discussion :)
---
Why... Wouldn't they?
---
I was a poor priest at that time and the price was out of my reach.
---
no
---
It solves some problems like when tourists leave we don't have too many realms that are now suddenly having population issues vs massive queues.
---
The main problem with the system is how abuseable it is, and immersion breaking it is.
---
If I was in charge, I would instead make the system like this:
---
You are invited to a group. You get an actual RP message saying something like "You are growing mad with illusions. Go to Stormwind chapple and see priest St. John to cure your deciese and he will make you see the real world.". You go to him and he cast like a 10 sec ritual on you, where your screen fades to black and back again and you are now in the party leaders layer.
---
It would be remembered as a "cool event" that only happened at the start of Classic instead of the game breaking mentality we have now.
---
Why is it so important to IMMEDIATLY get to the party leader's layer? What is this scenario that 2 friends have to play with eachother IMMEDIATLY or they QUIT THE GAME? It's not a real scenario.
---
Every BoE that drops is worth EXACTLY the same to every member of the party, and that's AH price.  Buy or sell.
---
Funny. Clean cities and their architecture is one if the reasons I don't play on Alliance side.
---
I like the sewers in UC though, heh.
---
I think you're underestimating the effect of AH fees.
---
Once you I raid logging, I try to keep my balance about even, floating on around 1k gold. Gold comes in via raiding, and goes out by way of consumables, repairs, enchants, crafting, respecs etc, and occasionally I farm for a few hours to make up the difference.
---
Sure, a significant part of that gold goes to other players (buying pots/herbs off AH, enchanting tips, ...), but I imagine most of those are doing the same thing I do, buying the stuff they need from the gold I bought stuff with. AH fees keep whittling away on the original sum, until it's basically gone, repair bills, respecs etc eat up the rest.
---
So I don't think inflation will be a huge problem, because people don't really farm gold they won't need to spend.
---
Yes i think. But for me, transfer is not a problem. I think it's maybe even a good thing, that you are able to transfer to a server with more ppl, or your friends.
---
Just things that change your character destroy the rpg, imo.
---
Wish i could give you gold but its still as hard to come by as it was back in vanilla 😜
---
Achievements, titles, mounts, pets ect. are the ONLY things that matter in retail pretty much ever since they got first introduced in early/mid tbc. And especially old ones which became unobtainable, because its all about vanity, prestige and cosmetics now.
---
These are the only things that you get to keep and carry over into new expansions. Gear is entirely meaningless, so are pvp/arena ranks (the only purpose of arena ranks are gladiator mounts, again vanity)
---
Look at what most of the whole core playerbase in retail is made up of, and why most of the hardcore wow players keep playing it and have been playing it for 10-15 years: To collect achievements, titles, mounts, ect. Raids are getting cleared the day or week they release. Noone cares about the new gear from new raids, they care about that new rare mount drop of the new boss.
---
Second harvest
---
I can't argue with this, but my experience in Vanilla was much different.
---
BoE that you can equip in a level or two: pass. Gz the person who got a great upgrade, move on. 
---
For more coveted (see: AH sellable) items -- everyone needs. That's money in the bank for your mount. 
---
In general I recall a less-greedy atmosphere in vanilla. Perhaps I'm wrong, but my recollections say people were generally OK with a BoE going to someone if it was a great upgrade &amp; wasn't worth a lot on the AH.
---
Why make the distinction between need and greed at all then? If a temporary upgrade is not worth it, then why bother at all. Why do we need items while leveling anyways? It gets replaced at some point , just go through the game with your starting gear and sell everything else that you can get your hands on.
---
If gold is the only permanent upgrade, as you have stated, then this would be the logical conclusion.
---
&gt;Keep in mind it was a laggy pos to begin with.
---
Were you there ? 0.01fps with constant server crashes and disconnects. It was a total shitshow. There is no fucking way it could ever be worse than that.
---
That's a thing that happened in early WoW. It wasn't that responsive. Ask any warrior who got stuck in cyclone in TBC 99999 times with spell reflection up. It's done on purpose because thats how it was. Now I'm not saying it should stay or go, but this isn't some new bull shit.
---
Oh god I can only imagine what FB is like.
---
Believe what you want, i know you'll be disappointed.  
---
No good guild will accept you and raiding will be an annoyance before you clear BWL due to wipes and consume expenses.
---
2006 broadband was mainstream in gaming, here is a totally random article where online gamers are discussing ping and pointing out that below 100 is best for FPS, but RPGs can get away with higher than that.  
---
Note how they're talking about ADSL and BroadBand as if it's a normal everyday thing, it's because it was a normal everyday thing.
---
From the UK in 2007ish me and buddies would sit on 30ms max to UK servers and 75ms average to continent.

---
Both continents are on their own exclusive layer, so you can have 4500-6000 ppl on a server without double layers.
---
True, i will upload some pictures later to be more specific ;)
---
But I don't know (or care) if you really need it. We all need gold tho.
---
What would be the best class to rush to level 5. What about to level 35. Any tips for quickly leveling to these points.
---
Mine was near the leather worker in darn if I was a ne. Or the little hidden alley house in stormwind.
---
Balance is literally one of the talent trees, which you need to spec deep into to get Moonkin as a transformation, my way of playing is completely valid. It's just looked down upon by try hards and people who have no idea how the meta of vanilla have evolved over the years on private servers and have no idea people have done theory crafting and figured out they are in fact viable for raiding, you just need to put in a lot more effort

Because of these feature, the people (characters) in game become somewhat anonyme/faceless. 
---
There was a time, you remembered ppl ingame. 
---
Nowadays ppl change the race/look/name like their underwear.
---
Maybe it's just me, who feels that way, i don't know.
---
Damn you hated the Barrens?
---
Okay I can see your point. 
---
Murder Centaurs, Explore Pools, Murder 1-4 types of beasts, Fuck up some Harpies, Genocide Some Quillboars. 
---
I love the Barrens. In terms of the 'young hero' stuff it all works for me. You're sent out on a bunch of shitty quests all over the place, you do the deed and come back and are sent on another shitty quest somewhere all over the place and at the end of it all you're sent to a new hub.
---
idk, Barrens in Vanilla felt great to me back then, and again after doing it a few times on a private server. 
---
That said, STV can suck a dick if you're on the &lt;50:50 end of a server. Getting camped while trying to complete a quest is something I hope (but imagine) I won't go through again.
---
I've had this discussion in another post before. I will always go with need &gt; greed, no matter how much the item might be worth on the market. If an enchanting recipe drops that is worth 1k gold it should go to the enchanter in the group, without a doubt in my mind. If some other BoE BiS drops that is worth 1k gold it's the same, whoever actually needs it, gets it ... to make sure nobody cheats, equipping it will be required.
---
If somebody ninjas an item, he'll immediately land on my ignore list. I will go out of my way so that loot gets distributed fairly. If I notice a ninja and he does not change his behavior after a warning, I'll punish him: e.g. by rolling need on every item that he/she could actually need, if I win and somebody else needs it, they will get it from me.
---
I will never tolerate selfish behavior.
---
Im sure they will use both in 1-5 start areas. They arent just not promoting it.
---
No idea what you are talking about
---
&gt; Nobody fives a fuck on those realms. If players are dumb enough to play on a popular streamer realm, they deserver layering for full phase 1 and long queues after
---
Yeah fuck anyone who doesn't research all the streamers and just rolls on a random server amirite
---
So then roll need on every single BoE then? Since everyone needs gold? Pretty sure that is why there is personal loot in the game now since so many people complained about that type of behavior. 
---
[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/4736886/dev-watercooler-mists-of-pandaria-looting-explained](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/4736886/dev-watercooler-mists-of-pandaria-looting-explained)
---
Here is a link as to why they introduced personal loot. "If you can need, you probably do. Then drama ensues."
---
The point is there IS NOT always something to spend gold on.  You got no more skills to buy, no mounts to buy, no items to buy as anything worth having is crafted or BOP once you get to AQ era.    
---
The biggest single gold sink at this stage is people quitting the game, as active players are still generating worth into the game economy, far quicker than its going out.
---
I don't give a flying fuck dude.
---
As a Norwegian I am insulted-  that I am not on your list :-(
---
pets were able to keep chasing you after stealth but not vanish, should be the same in classic
---
My home was lakeshire. I liked the bridge and the lake
---
He straight up says he doesn't know the tech lol. Human memory is faulty and yes I'm going to believe a straight copy of the code.
---
For me it's not about helping people, it's about being taken advantage of.
---
If a player constantly rolls need on everything and I check his gear, as long as he's wearing the items we're completely fine. But if they're for an alt, how would I ever know?
---
&gt; AOE-Looting? CLEARLY not in Vanilla.
---
There is no AOE looting in classic. Autolooting that IS in vanilla just means you dont have to SHIFT click the body to pick everything up. It literally changes looting by skipping that shift pressing.
---
Good points. Hate packing extra ammo and losing a bag slot to a quiver too. I do love some pickpocketing action. Lockpicking is fun too for me. I am definitely rolling rogue main. Might make an alt hunter later.
---
I'm also going for Dwarf Priest. A bit different on starting professions - Tailoring/Skinning. 
---
Tailoring because I'll not join the race for world first and there are some nice gear pieces that you can get while leveling. The big plus is that it's not hard to keep it up to date and early Mooncloth CDs for that Truefaith robe.
---
Skinning - for the mount at 40 (ish). After I get the mount I will drop it for Enchanting. I expect a lot of dungeon grinding as fresh 60 and it will be very good to DE the BoP blues and greens. I think the high level enchanting mats will be in high demand.
---
For end game - Herb (for farming consumes) / Enchanting ( I mainly focus on Strat Live with a tank from the guild to farm orbs and that works for me).
---
Now  back to your question - I vote for late game Herb / Engineering. You cover the PvE consumes / PvP gadgets and also PvP consumes / PvE gadgets. ;)
---
 BoE items that sell for a lot of gold on the AH should be needed by everyone. Lets say Kang the Decapitator, Shadowfang etc drop, one dude in the group can claim he is going to equip it but he would have to be one strange fellow if he did. Big risk he will say he will equip and then just sell it on the AH for tons of gold.
---
 This approach of everyone needing on BoE:s will cause arguments though if not stated before the run, no doubt about it. A warrior tank seeing Kang the Decapitator drop will flip out if a mage needs on it most probably. He is going to think it's his just because he is warrior. Will cause a lot of arguments.
---
 I had planned to roll a tank at first. Before every run I would type in that we were needing on expensive BoE:s. Now I decided to not roll a tank. As a dps joining a group you have much less say since you are so easy to replace so probably will just shut my mouth and prepare for rage once some super expensive BoE drop.
---
The answer I've been looking for. And I agree, what I mean by "viable to level" is "will this take me a reasonable amount of time to level as, or will I end up as the slowest leveling character on the realm?", so aka, will leveling with a shammy help elevate my mana issues enough to make it reasonable to level?
---
"I don't care." is a very fitting response.
---
Let me say it this way: If you don't care about others, I will care that you reap what you sow.
---
I feel it could change MY experience. For me, in a rpg, ppl should identify with their chars, thus changes shouldn't be possible.
---
Maybe im just a lowkey rp fan, who knows...
---
Swamp of sorrows, blasted lands, desolace.
---
What mobs in Azshara have Felcloth? https://classicdb.ch/?item=14256
---
I've never played vanilla. I started in tbc and really kicked off in wrath. I've always liked old style mmos. But usually find it hard to get into one.
---
I've played bfa since the start when friends "forced" me back. We would get the team back together and raid what we could. Had a ton of fun in uldir. Managed to get down zul mythic before I had to go inactive for work.
---
When I came back a few months later the guild had imploded. I can't raid anymore, doubt any guild would have me since I have to go away for a couple of months every few months.
---
The rest of the game isn't interesting anymore. You grind azerite for your neck and either raid or m+.
---
So I can't wait for classic where there is not really such fast progression.
---
I can't wait for classic where my priest is a priest again and not a gimped disc priest, gimped holy priest or gimped shadow priest.
---
I hate hype, but I already have a sub. Might as well just switch over.
---
My mates and I got so many screenshots with this thing
---
\*Ashjre'thul
---
As a tank making my own groups anyone needing on anything they don't need will be booted from the group, ignored and branded as a ninja.
---
Lol? But you enter in a thread about "gaming in comfortable place". You reply to posters. But.... you dont give a flying fuck?
---
I know a good psychotherapist dude, i can give you the phone if you are interested.
---
Lol how disingenuous do you want to be? You're telling me you can't make the distinction between a green item and a blue item? I care far, far less about someone getting an upgrade through a green item that I could maybe sell for 5% of the value of a blue, maybe less.
---
So now that you've figured out that this isn't beta do you think maybe the frenzy about leeway kind of has you biased about hunters and leeway ?
---
because blizzard hates fun
---
Eve teaches you patience and not trusting anyone
---
That's true its not a 1:1 copy paste, but you think they're just trying to hide shit you for whatever conspiracy theory reason you can come up with. We've already gone through this once with the elite damage and people still didn't believe them when they showed the reference client. You'll just come up with some mental gymnastics about how it isn't accurate and end up back on private servers regardless.
---
Guessing you are thinking about bank alts and getting something like alchemy on a level 35 one? 
---
I plan to eventually get a 35 bank alt for alchemy. My thinking is that for the alchemy alt I will roll a class I would never want to get to 60. 
---
 So for example I am most probably rolling a warlock, slim chance a priest. If I decided to go for Priest I would roll a 35 hunter alt. A warlock 35 would be more enjoyable for me to level but since there is a chance I would eventually want a 60 warlock I rather roll the hunter. Wouldn't want alchemy on a 60 warlock.
---
 Can add as well to the other guys post about level 5 warlock, if you roll a human warlock you can get the imp quest done at level 1. That should make for even faster leveling to 5. There is a guide by Joana on youtube.
---
Since he's just standing out of agro range to res.
---
Like it or not, they'll keep layering obviously. 
---
This is why they need to remove that shit from the begining.
---
Sooo having people work on a product is not an expense in your world? By doing it this way, retail players get is as a bonus as well and it's simpler, with only one sub.
---
They announced classic on Nov 3rd 2017, and bfa released Aug 14th 2018. I'm no longer sure you know what you are talking about.
---
no its tbc pre-patch and she uses a model addon to look like a belf, she is actually as nelf
---
So its better to grind with enh gear than ele?
---
If Blizzard was intelligent, nope. TBH, still wont. Thanks to how the game used to work, it will be easy to blacklist non-English people. TBH, it isnt like I hate them, and it isnt there fault they have to play with us. Its Blizzard's
---
The FFXIV expansion has been stellar. By the time it gets boring classic will be nigh.
---
Exactly, if you meet someone really cool in the barrens, you may never cross paths with them while leveling again because of layering and Bam. No friendship arises.
---
The repetition and familiarity is killed with layering.
---
How does one obtain this gift from blizz ? EU player here
---
Its not a duel if its 2v2
---
Meanwhile I'm going to be treating WoW Classic like a 2nd full time job.
---
OK, so it definitely would not mean that you don't need to drink anymore if you want to focus *solely* on casting spells but even as a caster you never only cast spells - you wand, you melee hit etc.
---
So - if your question is: "Would I be able to just spam away and not care" - no, you wouldn't. If your question is: "Does Shaman make most sense if I want to cast spells also and not just run in cat or bear?" - yes, it makes the most sense.
---
If we're talking mana management, just having a buddy in itself is a great upgrade because you:
---
 &gt; can kill literally twice as many mobs before need a mana break
---
 &gt; switch between who's casting and who's hitting so 5 second rule kicks in
---
In addition to that Shaman gives you Mana Spring totem (which I believe is exactly what this post was from the beginning hinting at) so from mana management perspective he's the best choice you have.
---
If we're talking about sheer efficiency you'd probably level the fastest with a Rogue or a Warrior because Warrior are terrifying when they get a healer on their back and finding a Druid + Rogue combo in world PVP is just unfair for the opposing player - but obviously I recommend having fun instead. : D
---
Hope this clears things up for you. : )
---
SoS, Blasted Lands, and Desolace can all get nuked.
---
Of those three, Blasted Lands at least had some semblance of quest progression for a little bit. 
---
I don't recall any single SoS quest, nor any Desolace Quest outside of "murder this Kolkar group"
---
How often would the rogue not have hunter's mark on them anyway? Vanish doesn't remove hunter's mark does it?
---
When that kind of shit is awesome. Have this particular cosy spot. Just like when it's raining in the game and I don't go out because there's a fire inside the inn, and I'd rather wait it out to feel immersed!
---
No. Classic is not remastered at all. None of the knowledge and experience of the last 15 years is going into it. Things like encounter design, class balance, user interface improvements, etc. There’s a ton of things I wish Classic had, but that’ll never happen.
---
well the thing is, it does it with a warlock pet as well...
---
The Felwood grind (assuming Alliance) is rough as fuck.
---
stopped playing shortly into mop then tried again in legion and maybe another one but it just felt like a rotting corpse of what it once was with people just going through the motions. I still follow the lore drops of retail and i wish that blizz would prove all of my pessimism wrong create a retail exp that just blows the doors off but I lost hope a while ago.
---
It is no biggie, you know, to experience fully this game you must play both factions, else you are missing out many leveling zones/quests
---
I guess its fair exchange for all the room peeking you healers do while we pull mob.
---
"HEY I WANNA SEE TOO! \*pulls half of fucking sm cathedral with him\*"
---
This game needs to come out already. Jesus
---
&gt; They even scaled the level of mobs
---
Yeah this is what killed my attempt to get back into retail about 6 months ago. Went to level something and realized everything was always going to be my level and gave up. Plus they completely fuckered crafting.
---
Vanish does remove hunters mark
---
That's a very toxic attitude and very generalizing. When Blizzard showed the 1.12 reference client for elite damage I 100% believe them. Because they showed us the 1.12 proof. A small and perhaps vocal minority refuted it, but they weren't going to listen to reason anyways.
---
They have not done that for other discrepancies highlighted by the community, and until they fix it or prove us wrong we will bring it up in order to make Classic wow a more true Vanilla experience and a better game as a whole. I will not set foot on a Vanilla private server when Classic launches. This is the Blizzard Vanilla I've been waiting YEARS for. But that also means I want it to be the best/most accurate.
---
Also it's not a "conspiracy theory" I have come up with, I'm using the worlds of a true original WoW Developer.
---
Un'goro is a love-hate thing for me.
---
I love the aesthetic, the mobs.
---
I hate most of the quests.
---
It is a lot like Stonetalon [H] for me -- power through it and move on.
---
All realms will drop in population. Certainly some more than others but it's not like some realms won't drop.
---
Best feeling for me when it comes to rain is when you're roaming through STV and it's raining heavily and you see one of your boys getting attacked by some alliance scum.
---
They're 2v1ing him and you manage to get off a big heal and come to his aid. Then just a /nod. And continue with what we were doing.
---
The brothership of the horde. Bonus points if the person I'm helping is a tauren.
---
[That still isn’t enough to change the country’s low English fluency rating](https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/regions/latin-america/brazil/), most of which stems from the average Brazilian only having ~7 years of formal education.
---
Triggered
---
Personal loot was the wrong fix. The correct thing to do was make rolling need on boes bind them. You want to AH you roll greed you want to equip you roll need.
---
Mom..
---
Want to make gold, Blacksmithing.
---
Want to PvP, Engineering.
---
Want to make gold and PvP?
---
Well...get both.
---
That a false scenrio. the situation is 5 resto and one pure dps, verse 5 resto and 1 enh.
---
While I love STV's aesthetics and quests, I'm probably going to avoid it as much as I can, at least until I'm close to 40. The world PvP there is just too much of a pain to endure for a peacefull Warrior who just wants to do quests and pick flowers.
---
You can think that if you like, but bugs do get out of Blizzard betas all the time, even big ones. In Legion pets' startattack became bugged and had a slight delay. Both hunter pets and warlock are less responsive than previously, they had a bug that came seemingly out of nowhere.
---
That bug was identified  and reported in Legion Beta, made it to Live Legion, existed through Legion, and then BFA Beta, BFA Live, and still exists on Live. It ALSO was ported to Classic client because of the design process. This bug is still not fixed on Classic either.
---
If you care about soloing anything yeah, druid is a much safer bet. I have to agree that warriors get the coolest visual upgrades out of everyone though.
---
What bothers is me that a middle ground exists where skillful exchanges are able to occur without the batching window being so high (or whatever mechanics are at play).
---
Dwarf warrior so I can destroy rogues who blind me.
---
Your...
---
It is a randomly generated roll.
---
Any can be first.
---
It will never happen in the same time, even if you tank more adds than the number of attacks in the attack table.
---
No downside, but you may as well save yourself half an hour of running through the Barrens and do Mulgore while your friend does Durotar. Then meet in the Crossroads.
---
True that thanks!
---
I’m torn between Tauren Shamman and Orc Warlock.
---
I feel the warlock would be easier to get gold and gear with since it’s only a dps spec class. Strong in pvp and a progressive dps class as the game goes on.
---
With shaman, I know I’ll be healing in PVE, accepted it and never been a healer before so that is pretty cool to try something new. What is making me really wanting it is the insane fun burst damage elemental has in pvp. If I get bored of playing elemental which would be unlikely, I have the option to go healing or even a melee dps in pvp. More to play with on shaman.
---
Locks are really strong in pvp but the burst isn’t as exciting with a lock as it is with seeing chain lightning crits in fights.
---
Any suggestions from experienced players of these two classes?
---
Thanks!
---
And I would kick people if they didn't "need" it over someone who did.
---
The question is why would a low level Alliance player go to STV when they have Redridge and Duskwood.
---
The armor really doesn't matter, since you'll be armor capped just from the rest of your gear. Unyielding maul has a huge advantage since you can put 3% haste on for more tps while warden staff has no relevant enchant until 2h agility arrives in some uncertain phase and at that point you want to use a dps weapon with feral ap anyway.
---
Pinworms will need to be fed and thus redistributed to an afflict able host via adhesive taped to the rectal cavity..
---
Enjoying things in moderation is a hallmark of adult behaviour.
---
Great point - I'm not aware of the exact stat weights for priests, so I had a hard time figuring out exactly why piece X would be better than piece Y.   
---
Dispelling being big in MC is a great point! And yeah I agree that the overall combination on having more stam, more int, mp5, etc, is preferable to having pure +heal and worth losing a bit of raw healing output for. After all, in a more realistic raid setting of non-perfect raiders you'll take more damage, the fight might be a bit longer, you might not use the perfect heal every cast, etc.   
---
Nice reminder from your side that the theory-crafted conclusions for what is theoretically best will not always apply in real raid scenarios. It sucks having full T1 and not using it ;)
---
Imagine putting 25 agility instead of 3% haste lol
---
I'm not saying there aren't bugs or that things come out of beta in perfect form I just think your attitude is absurd it legit matches that of conspiracy theorists. You think they're purposefully not trying to recreate vanilla due to lazyness / money even though everything they've shown us thus far has been on the up and up. It's crazy.
---
&gt;good 2 hours session
---
And the shire
---
Did it and will do it again in Classic. For some reason I liked to think my characters were sleeping while waiting for me to come back. It's called rested experience so it only makes sense.
---
Wait what?
---
Need to check my own list again
---
It's because he's a Tauren
---
Because dwarf master race.
---
This is super faulty logic for their perspective though. If you DE or sell a BoP you get a small amount of gold this compared to an actual upgrade from the BoP item to the player makes 0 sense. However in the case of BoE's you are talking about much larger amounts of gold that are then equal for each player.  
---
I'll try to make it super simple. 2hand axe that is BOP and makes the warrior do 50 % more damage is worth a lot more than 7g to the other 4 members. 2hand axe that is BOE and makes the warrior do 50 % more damage is 100g to every player.  
---
See the power difference ? I know you're probably just being obtuse to win the reddit argument, but its super faulty logic.
---
They came a bit late as well from what I remembe?, the only way to transfer server was if your realm was full and you could transfer for free to a new one or low pop one.
---
It changed recruting alot for our guild , we could recruit from whole of Europe rather than just our own server,

Private servers have ridiculously fast respawn rates. Classic will have normal respawn rates, so 1000 players will have to fight for 20 mobs on a 5 minute timer...Not gonna happen.
---
Paladins make ally better for raiding generally speaking, racials make horde better at disorganised PvP (aka random bgs).
---
How else do you get rest bonus?
---
Your opinion of it isn't really relevant though. Why would they release their proprietary server code to the public?
---
Eh what? Isnt NE basically the best choice for tank? Dwarven stoneform (+ frostres for late in naxx) is really good too. Humans are only best for dps warriors with weapon skill. 
---
Some people argue that weaponskill also helps a tank with aggro but seriously... ? As a raid tank you are ALWAYS hitcapped anyway, and if you lost aggro it was definitely not because you lacked 5 weaponskill... A Tank losing aggro is 99% the dps' faults anyway. I would gladly take 1.x% more passive avoidance as a pure pve tank any day over a 3 minute situational cd or a \~0.x% higher rage gain.

???
---
mulgore is filled with druid/shaman/hunter. hf getting a tag as warrior.
---
I'm duo leveling a warrior with my friends priest and then solo leveling a hunter. I feel like engineering/mining is the best profession combo for both characters. I also really love engineering, but I've leveled it on most my characters including my warrior I leveled to 60 with in vanilla. Do you think something else is viable? 
---
I'm not a huge fan of leatherworking or blacksmithing. My thought is maybe alch/herb for the warrior for something different. Could also be helpful for the priest friend?
---
What do you think?
---
Me and my ex-girlfriend both did it when we were going to log off. Together. Now I'm sad :(
---
But I imagine we're getting fixed Andorhal. The walled version was horrible, one of my worst experiences in gaming. Leveling a warrior inside those walls was a nightmare. Ghouls with nasty diseases all around.
---
What doe z- do?
---
why is that a problem?
---
In retail there are realms that are primarily French. Zul'jin is a heavily horde dominated realm but the alliance is mostly french speakers.
---
Why would they keep layering?
---
Yes the high population Vanilla servers had and around 3000 concurrent users, but that wasn't the population cap. Most high population servers had around 20.000 monthly active users and the population cap was 30.000 monthly users, so blizzard is obviously not aiming for a total population of 3000 players on each server.
---
Once people start playing some hours a week you can probably collapse the layers into one server and healthy high populated server.

I know I'm playing Warrior, and likely will be leveling with a Rogue friend or another fellow Warrior.
---
My question is whether to level Fury and respec Arms at Lvl 40 for Mortal Strike, or to just go Arms all the way. 
---
It seems Fury is more popular starting out, but Arms has some better PvP choices, which I will be on a PvP server when leveling.
---
Is the Arms tree going to open up more early level PvP tools and not be much of a dps uptime loss? I suppose if Arms actually were to help me win some fights, then it saves corpse run times which more than make up for any dps in efficiencies from choosing arms vs fury early on.
---
Sound right or nah?
---
You should probably calm down. I’m not disputing or advocating anything, I’m stating **why** people clamored for 400 ms spell batching.
---
armor is not a prio stat. its cool, but not something you're actively looking for. mp5 is 99,9% useless for pvp, just ignore it. i don't like the concept of stat weighting for pvp because it depends too much on the situation and your other gear. but if i had to its probably sta&lt;int&lt;crit/sp.
---
yeah you can learn a lot from that game like how to HTFU and how not to fly something you can't afford to lose :)

You could and you would do it a lot even in 1 AV. Even tho i agree that spell batching need some fine-tuning.
---
Not what I said.  The shaman is taking up a damage spot in the raid and not dealing any damage.  So you use healers spots for windfury and bring a real damage class instead of the enhancement shaman.  You still bring the same amount of shamans to raid
---
    It would be illegal to distribute this client to other users, sure, but i don't think that was your original argument.
---
This was exactly my entire point. Private servers = distribution not expressly authorized by Blizzard Entertainment. They also send C&amp;D to protect their IP, which they can most definitely enforce and go through legal action in most countries except for Russia, which is why most private servers are hosted there.
---
It's over.  You just admitted to being completely clueless and just talking out of your ass
---
You mean Medhiv? since felweed is on the other side and he's the only one who can open the portal :p
---
Season 5 was a write off, I'd even add Seal of Blood to the list of stupid shit. But I thought 6-8 were pretty great, personally. Not sure if Blizzcon is a fair example when it's literally the top 0.0001% of arena players using the "best" throughput comp. I remember it having a pretty decent amount of variety at a realistic mmr.
---
Well that’s just wrong. The massive difference in France and Germany’s EF rating is almost completely attributed to Germany pushing it in their primary education system.
---
&gt; Orc stun resist + enhancement axe memes. 
---
The weapon skill bonus doesn't do much in pvp. It's 0.2% hit, as well as 0.2% dodge, parry and block reduction.
---
IF shaman is what you love, go with a troll shaman. Yes, you'll be slightly weaker in pvp than an orc or tauren, but it really isn't that big of a deal, that troll becomes useless and as oyu said, you have the top choice in pve.
---
Trolls are born with the mojo in it, you ever tried troll hair ?
---
I used to think finding a bed would boost rested XP 🤣
---
Then your account is tied to one layer of one server? What you're saying is to essentially create more realms and merge them later, which is a fantastically bad idea.
---
Then you go with the 5 resto.  You lose damage with the additional shaman
---
&gt;So a tip to anyone with an SO, spend as much time with her now and earn those brownie points for when classic launches.
---
That doesn't work with everyone tho, lol. Like "I'll be spending every night for the upcoming 4-5 months just with you babe, but then i'll disappear for almost all the evening when Classic hits". That's a no for my SO Lol. 1-2 hour per night with her and that's it? I'm not sure that will do it.
---
That's my main concern actually, not being able to balance both gaming and GF , and be frustrated by it. I have to find a solution to deal with this.
---
I remember just searching for the zone name and it seemed to work, but yeah that would remove the chance of random players popping in!
---
There was some other really useful filters I have already forgotten like only searching for priest or between a range of levels too.
---
Druids are for innervate. And mark.
---
I totally get that. 
---
I admit that I had issues in my younger years, but that's just not the case anymore.
---
 I work full time, stay busy tending to my family and husbandly duties. Near the end of the day (say between 7pm and 930pm ish) is my time to browse the internet and/or indulge in some video games. Even when classic releases, my real world responsibilities will prevent me from "nolifeing it". 
---
You are wise to identify addiction, and perhaps people can reflect on that as well, but for me I know I deserve an hour or two at the end of the day to fill with whatever I want
---
Aaaw shit here we go again. Warrior vs rogue?  
---
Rogue: Fun in both world PVP and battlegorund, Good in PVE, able to farm gold. Hard to find groups/guilds.
---
Warrior:  Fun in PVP if you have gear/or a healer, Good in PVE, easy to find groups/guilds, hard to solo farm.
---
So for me it seems you get: Good pvp all around and being able to gold farm solo choose rogue, but sacrifice being able to find groups easily.  
---
However, I will most likely only be able to raid once a week + play a couple of hours every know and then. **So a big reason to go warrior is, I won't waste to much of my time searching for dungeouns, because every one can use a tank.**
---
What would you guys suggest, do i miss something in my pros and cons?
---
I spent so long in Azshara fishing primal water that I still think I could plot the course between the spawn points if you showed me a map.
---
That said, I kind of enjoy that there were zones without major plot significance or progression that just felt like "part" of the world and hosted a few questlines. It makes the world feel slightly more organic than every area being compartmentalized and having a specific bracket and purpose.
---
Agreed.  I’ll be playing classic because I want dungeon runs to be more deliberate. In BC the whole charge in bit was novel (“Mua ha ha we are aoe gods!”) while still offering some challenges, but over time the lack of initiative to design encounters that couldn’t be brute forced turned everything pretty mindless.
---
Pickpocketing is inflated in pservers so this won't be as good as you think!
---
Its becouse of leeway
---
I just think if an item drops that an upgrade, so say the tanking book in DM or the priest robe pattern/warlock robe pattern, they should get that item because they can use it. Needing against them and selling it to them comes off as greedy as hell.
---
Reminds me of that vanilla flavors shaman guide.
---
yah. Well, back then I was already an oldie with a long background in fantasy games (SSI gold box etc) but was lucky enough to find a guild with rather mature people (was 25-30 or so back then). I am still interested in the world, and hope I can find a decently chill guild with modest ambitions so that I can enjoy the game. I am more afraid that PUGs might be a PITA, but I hope not. 
---
&gt; Edit: with the caveat that those 40% have learned how to be decent f'n humans in the interim.
---
yah, unfortunately age and maturity do not always come together...
---
Thanks, you too!
---
Nah I'm happy to tank dungeons honestly. Raid tanking is not for me.
---
Don't worry too much about sonsumables. Tanks are always a welcome sight and if you know your stuff, people will generally support you with consumables when needed for raids. People know, that ap rot warrior isn't exactly well suited to farming gold. Also consumables aren't as critical as you may think.
---
If MC is pugged by the point you are 60, you should lower your expectation a bit. flasks and consumlabes likely won't be necessary for any pug raid. But you have trouble finding groups, if you are undergeared comapred to other tanks. But this absolutely depends on the dynamics of your server. If it's tank starved, you'll get a  spot even with bad gear.
---
such a simple solution to this problem.  
---
need roll causes the item to become BoP. done.
---
apparently it is a major problem for some players to behave like a decent human being otherwise.
---
 Better to workout a little than not at all for sure in regards to your "when to workout section" but I mean we shouldn't be glued onto the computer all our free time. 
---
 I workout twice every other day, strength training in the morning and rowing in the evening. I am pumped as hell for classic but in no way shape or form will I switch my routine around to be able to play more. Anyone wanting to take care of themselves should have the same approach. Don't have to work out as much as I am but you should make room for proper training sessions. So not just workout a little while sitting in front of some dungeon waiting for people. Taking say a full hour every other day for training is not a big sacrifice at all.
---
 In the long run what is better, spending say 3-4 hours per week on training( boosting your ego, health, strength, appearance etc) or 3-4 hours extra on your gnome mage or whatever. You can survive not being able to play on that mage those hours. 
---
 One thing I should add though, your suggestion for when to workout isn't very productive if we are talking about that time being spent on "normal workouts". HOWEVER there is something called grease the groove training( google it) which is about during the day incorporating a set of an exercise at 50% max rep as soon as you are not feeling the effect of the previous one. This is done during a limited time of around 3-4 weeks.
---
 For example I did grease the groove training for pull ups a little over a year ago. Was incredibly beneficial. I would do 50% pull up max rep around every 30-60 min during the whole day. Strength is a skill. Doing an exercise this frequently will improve your form and ability. Also, and this is the thing, your neurological connections will improve because of the frequency. Your body will adapt and be able to use your muscles more effectively for the exercise in question. Thus you will improve your rep max a lot if you follow through with this training. You do have to have a baseline of fitness beforehand though.
---
Why would you bother with a priest getting shadow tap when you won't be running oom in the first place when killing fast enough?
---
WF will make things die faster and therefore need to heal less making it moot. Also, bubble on warrior = no rage gained when hit. We've already seen mobs in am hit like wet noodles anyway so the biggest limiting factor is the 4 warrior kill speed.
---
Mages can in theory aoe down packs at a much faster rate, I will agree with that. This is assuming successful half instance pulls and a way to deal with *that* man ranged mob DPs as well. I feel in practice there is a ton of potential for wiping depending on instance.
---
Most guilds will gear for PvE so you need a PvP focused guild, even then you are competing for every piece with other classes plus you will be needing to try and take healing gear to help the raid. I would say it won't be easy but many people do it, just need to find the right guild and have patience.
---
If it's a pricey low level BoE I am rolling need. We all need the gold and to be fair, the twinks need it more than you need it for the 5 levels you are going to use it anyway. 
---
If we are higher level and it's your preraid bis item I'll pass to you.
---
Counterpoint: skip straight to phase 4. If you want to get in shape, you'll have much better results making dedicated time for it. Trying to mix pt with other activities just makes them both worse.
---
The BoE item was always available to everyone. On the AH. If it drops in the group, it's not suddenly worth more or less to any particular player, it's still just worth X gold. 
---
It's actually a much fairer approach to just consider big ticket BoE as a big pile of gold and be done with it, because that's all they are. If you want a big ticket BoE, you don't run random dungeons, you grind gold and you buy it, like everyone else.
---
You trying to imply the distinction between green items that drop a dozen times per dungeon versus blue items that drop one per dozen dungeons is the same thing as the distinction between two very rare items, one that's level 16 and one that's level 19? Because it isn't.
---
You get a lot of the gear while just being resto. Most of your ele pieces arent very sought after either so it's not too horrible getting those either. Overall, not too bad.
---
Can someone explain the situation as if I'm a noob? ELIaN?
---
Nah, knew it was troll after the first sentence.
---
Bit torn on what to pick, gf decided she is going ne hunter on pve server- and I'd like to team up with her. I've always played paladin, but not sure if I am ready for the classic paladin once more.. Been thinking going ne/dwarf priest, gnome lock, ne druid or pala. I pref. Being able to contribute/support.
---
Because races legit don't matter lol. They barely matter for min-maxers. If you hate the way you look, you won't play. What's better, sticking with the game and playing long enough to see your character get geared, or playing SUPER OPTIMAL for a few months and quitting because you hate your character?
---
You are wrong, rogue is op in pvp, even more with this leeway and batching, rogue pop is gona be huge
---
&gt; That just might not be an option.
---
Yeah, it won't be an option.
---
Unless you marry a gamer they will really understand what drives us and what enjoyment we get out of gaming and they will always find away (even if it is unconsciously) to fill your spare time with other things.  Unless you come to some sort of agreement beforehand, you will be a casual scrub like the majority of us.
---
My wife most probably spends more time gaming than I do, and it can be a real pain in the ass when I finally have a chance to sit down and boot up a game and that is when she decides that she is going to stop playing and we should go for a drive and look at stuff.
---
To be fair, you won't have any problems leveling as a trio ,regardless of class composition.
---
The only downside to non solo leveling is that you'll have to grind 2 times more than you would when leveling solo since exp is split equally amongst all 3 of you, so you'll clear slay quests fast but most quests require some form of gathering /non shareable objective component. Not to mention quest exp in classic is really low compared to other expansions, the bulk of the exp gained is from mob kills, which will force you to kill more in other to balance out the amount of players in your grp soaking up your exp.
---
If you want to consider better options for class compositions you'd have to consider how your group fits in a dungeon , you typically want to minimize the need of having to wait too long by filling in what is most needed, and that's tanks/healers , since dps is far easier to find.
---
So your druid can be a tank or a healer which is fine but you'd need a person with a rezz (since druids can only combat rezz in classic on a long cd ), in which case the shadow priest could be the one doing the healing while the druid tanks and the most complimentary dps that follows is always a mage, mages are great in any group due to several ease of life perks, infinite/free food and water , portals to cross continents reducing travel time and great dps/aoe /CC , would be a much better trade-off than a lock in a trio group.
---
Another option is Shaman + warrior +X , warriors have a harder time leveling than most due to low sustain and high downtime between pulls, shaman fixes that and boosts warrior's damage via totems, the synergy between the 2 classes is great but the only a shaman might suffer from while leveling is mana issues and lack of peels which can be remedied v several classes, priests shields /CC and off heals can help shamans when in a pinch, mage peels and water also make shammies' life easier, druid innervate and off tanking/healing can also help reduce some of the issues that they might have.
---
Warlocks in general strive when solo due to being able to tank/heal and dps by themselves, the class is a 1 man trio group, there's almost no benefit in having a lock in a trio group that another class can't benefit more from, sure locks bring utility but most of the time that utility isn't really needed in the leveling stage of the game.
---
The only time a lock benefits more from not leveling solo is when duo leveling on alliance with a paladin, since the lock can forgo using a voidwalker and focus entirely on multi dotting, pulling massive amounts of mobs which the paladin follow up with a BoP to drop the aggro off the lock when shit hits the fan, if you add that to infinite life-tapping then the lock never has to stop and can continue to multi dot massive amounts of mobs which balances out the exp penalty of not being solo.
---
I hope so! :)
---
Druids do stupid threat regardless. If you MT a burn-heavy target, you throw on a Crowd Pummeler.
---
Good point! Something to consider and plan around, love it.
---
Yes frustration was part of vanilla... 
---
Spell batching is fine and made pvp dynamic, people like you is why is so trash today. Listening to cry babies that want everything smooth.
---
lol... Quests objectives and points of interests are not tracked on the map or minimap.
---
Whats songflower if I may ask?
---
So you have a group that not doesn't get shaman buffs which are WF, tranq, and mana totems (group depending). Those totems alone with a shamans 50% dps (not counting the fact that you get resist totems, tremor, etc)  provide you close to (and in rare cases more) than a pure dps would. Just run the numbers. 
---
Furthermore, if enh there is very little loot competition so in many ways its far cheaper to bring.
---
When an equally geared rogue has all their cooldowns up then in a 1v1 situation they are a nightmare to deal with.
---
God i hope it’s pee

Make sure that the Shadow bro and the Druid bro know that the likely hood of them raiding as either feral or shadow is unlikely but they will be able to level with that without any issues.
---
Some of us did want it exactly the way it is now.
---
I don't recall that as an automatic thing, more a "anyone mind if I need this for my alt?" kinda deal, which was usually accepted by the party.
---
Otherwise you need stuff you intend to use on your char (maybe ask if it is for off-spec stuff if it is close to max level) and greed everything else. If it is a very expensive boe you are needing, expect people to ask you to equit it.
---
Do you mean selling Goblin sapper charges?
---
Uh what? Most high end guilds had 2-3 mages. Hell if you look at the first two guilds to kill Illidan (Nihilium and Last Resort) they regularly had mages in their raid. Hell most of the better SSC/TK videos came from K3rp in Last Resort.
---
True. I leveled horde 1-60, then alliance 1-60 and was amazed how much worse Alliance traveling was. Everything was awkwardly placed.
---
And on top of that lvl 30-45 quests for alliance is hell, while Horde has it much easier.
---
On the other hand, lowbie quests for Alliance have much more atmosphere. And Duskwood is the pinnacle of lore of course.
---
I think it is necessary at the launch of the game. But it should be removed asap when it is no longer needed.
---
People only played the expansions because they were forced to. Blizzard really needs to burn to the ground for what they did. Evil people
---
You know what people do when they really think they’re gonna fail?
---
They set themselves up for failure. Layering is literally that, a setup for failure.
---
It counts on new people leaving the game as quickly as possible in order to work well.
---
What they seem to miss, is that it also will make those who signed up for Classic leave cause when they log in it’s not the same game as advertised. And they’ll likely not come back if they decide to leave, cause the trust is already broken.
---
Looks like their setup will do it’s job a bit too well..
---

Ele Shaman or Mage?
---
I don't mind healing raids. I just want to be a burst nightmare on the battlefield when it comes time to PvP.
---
Its fucking EZ as fuck!
---
All You do is:
---
1. Shield
---
2. Dot
---
3. Wand
---
4. Repeat
---
You have infinite mana when killing mobs that yield experience coz of the shadow talent.
---
You use little to no mana because of the Wand talent in discipline.
---
Its fun and simple.
---
50 shards or benched
---
This is also faulty logic to an extent. Stockade Pauldrons are BiS for Prot Warriors. The Warrior is going to try to get a pair anyways before they start raiding. Then, they’re blessed to see one drop in BRD, and suddenly the Rogue, hunter, Shaman, and Mage all roll need on it. To the Warrior, it’s worth more than the gold the others would get on the AH.
---
Season 8 was not a great time for melee, ele shamans were pretty crazy so if you left a pillar there was a chance you could just get globalled. I think comps like rls and rmp and wlx were phased out a bit while African turtle was pretty good, along with double healer shadowmourne , but mld and lsd were a huge part of the ladder and very difficult to deal with for any other comp.
---
Dude, maybe the best guilds will pick up 7 reso shamans with ease, but i think many more casual ones will be around 3-6. Im trying to educate on shamans usefulness so its closer to six.  As i already said rest shaman is what you want but if you only have 5 resto a 6th shaman who is enh isn't much different than a pure dps class.
---
The difference is small enough that cutting out extra locks and shadow priest (running what is it 2-3 locks) is a much larger dps increase than dropping a 6th shaman. But neither is necessary.
---
The truth is the average player will still be terrible and get dumpstered by a rogue  if he is out ganking.
---
Low latency and leeway just assists the rogues stay in melee range making kiting more difficult, but still possible.
---
No doubt a good player will toss a rogue no problem, but I really think the better players who have practiced or played in private servers will be a drop in the bucket compared to the actual classic wow populations. Add in the fact server communities will be segmented by servers, you only need to compete within the players there. Sure some servers might be cut throat but in OP's case he might somehow hit the loterry and be on a server full of potato's.
---
For the record, it tends to be welfare EU players who have been playing the game nonstop for the past decade since nost or beyond that will know how to deal with a rogue appropriately, not someone who just started playing classic again after quitting in TBC who will be rusty.
---
its a shame that they changed it to altar of storms since it actually has some pretty cool lore
---
in warcraft 2  it was called grombolar, or bowels of the giant in orcish. Gul'dan used it to house his death knights there ( diffrent Dk's then the ones from the lich king. concept is the same , risen warrior warlocks but those were horde only since gul'dan was still part of the horde then ) the temple was made out of bones of giants. in the second war these temples got destroyed but somehow they got reclaimed by the scourge and are used to summon banshees etc.
---
I’d agree that Ele sham is a “if I get off some casts, somebody’s getting hurt” class. Not much sustain, but in pvp sustain is a luxury anyway.
---
Destruction warlock is the only other nuking caster that even exists in vanilla, and you could have plenty of fun with that too.
---
I did it back then!
---
try path of exile :)
---
I remember it from back then.
---
No healer?
---
I can only speak to the gnome starting area, but you won’t even get your pet til probably level 4 there.
---
He's a mixed bag.  There are times he's talking about what he worked on, and it's really great information and perspective.  Other times he's being vague about the circumstances of his separation with Blizzard, like a ramble on making a deal with the devil and some "bald as fuck guy with dr pepper for blood", or playing an interview with Ion and pausing to nitpick things.  Then he makes statements like "it was not an unwelcome firing", without going in to the details, like he's trying to skirt being professional while still throwing some dirt at whoever.
---
I’m surprised their aren’t more
---
You said a lot of words to describe generalization. Wait, I did write "general"
---
I can't decide between Rogue, Priest or Warlock... It's driving me mad! I love PvP, but I want to try for PvE also, and with time limited as I now work fulltime, I want to consider that... I've drawn up this list of pro / cons, with ++ being things I care more about.
---
* Rogue
---
* \+++ Strong 1v1 pvp / W pvp
---
* \+ Stealth - can pick fights
---
* \+++ Free flowing smooth playstyle
---
* \+ Melee (no mana)

Dormammu I've Come To Bargain
---
played both sides.
---
alliance is objectively the better choice in every way possible.  
---
in vanilla, at least, there is no contest.  
---
better zones, better in PvP, better in PvE. its really unfair.  
---
where horde has to put in effort, alliance breezes past. its ridiculous.
---
still amazes me how private servers managed to get very balanced realms (close to 50:50) when alliance has it so much easier in general.
---
"Let me habituate you to my affections, then *withdraw them.*
---
Mileage may vary.
---
Beta streamer who gained popularity by grouping with some of the most notable faces the classic wow beta (like venruki, ziqo, sodapoppin, et al..).  He is french Canadian, extremely high energy and pretty funny.  He always says ofc... to everything..  It's funny and endearing when he does it but everyone else is copying him now..
---
As horde, there is practically zero downside of being different races as all starter zones are essentially connected (via zepplin and the barrens)
---
My cousins and I are running shaman warrior combos, with other friends playing ranged DPs classes.
---
I plan on trio leveling with at least 1 other warrior and shaman.
---
I didn't mind UA and maybe haunt, everything they added past that just got to be too much imo
---
You ignorant douche. Did you ask them about their work responsibilities irl or why would they be welfare players cause they liked to play the classic game for the past 10 years?
---
Knowing where to pick up the quests for a specific zone, especially when they can be spread across both continents, is not being a "trihard"; Swamp of Sorrows (especially for Alliance) being one of the more egregious zones for this.
---
Surprise! That is what we want. Classic style servers not new age low cost layer sharding garbage.
---
Verified
---
WoD and its wizard chores completed destroyed the game for me.
---
Pom pyro mage
---
The fact you feel the need to solve a non-problem shows why retail is failing.
---
I think the layering discussion is really a proxy for a larger argument about the long term success of the game. 
---
People that want layering, or believe it to be the best option, seem to believe the server populations will dwindle (quickly or slowly) down to substantially lower levels than at launch, so layering, or something on a similar scale, is needed to ease the servers from launch levels of players to those lower numbers. 
---
People that don't want layering seem to believe the populations will increase, or will decrease much more slowly and retain a higher number of players, and so layering is solving a problem that doesn't exist or is misunderstood, and ruining the game while doing nothing useful.
---
How are rogues op in the slightest?
---
I thought Tauren Hunter was kinda a "no go" due to the dead zone?
---
One thing id keep in mind is that at max level the druid and priest will both be expected to heal (assuming you want to do some raiding)
---
I agree about the diet. But not everyone can do dieting right away.
---
The kind of person this structure appeals to would be someone who can't be bothered (initially) with all of the analytics needed to maximize their gains and weight loss. This is meant to be one point of entry, not an end all be all program. 
---
As far as workouts go, what would you suggest?
---
Found the welfare EU who has been playing hardcore vanilla wow for the past decade.
---
Rank 14 Hunter here. In Vanilla i pretty much knew every trick in the book when it came to winning 1v1's or 1v2 and 1v3's when i outgeared the enemies. Farmed honor mostly doing premade wsg/ab but also AV. My role was often acting on my own defending a flag or being a pain in the ass midfield wsg distracting the enemy. Point is i dont think i did much of the cooperative play that would carry over to arena in tbc. Didnt fail completely at it and i also went more casual into tbc but anyway i felt like i would be one of them r14 guys who should have done better given my experience.
---
I'm talking mostly about destruction and affliction during cata, that's when I feel like warlock had a difficult and rewarding rotation to prefect.
---
&gt;so that you e.g. have farmed runes for some days to last you a while, then you farm gold for X consume another day, etc, instead of doing them one by one before every raid.  
---
&gt;The difference is that a hardcore guild will have an **efficient process for gatherings those consumables, and probably have many of them as a collective guild pile of consumables, that every raider contributes to and uses from, so that the time spent per person will be lower**. At the same time they need less consumables, because the clear raids faster and don't whipe. Whereas a guild struggling, but still tries hard,  will need to use new elixirs and pots every whipe, and their raid will last longer than a flask.
---
These are great ideas!
---
One shot macro &lt;3
---
Alliance, I disliked un'goro and badlands, just found it not very enjoyable.
---
I've noticed during the beta test that the extra needed hours was cut out of my sleep schedule. Expect to sleep 6 hours per day instead of your regular 8.
---
How do you figure? That rogue and hunter can use the gold they would get to buy devilsaur pieces. In fact it would buy more than one piece where as the warrior would just get one slot upgraded. The devilsaur would have a larger impact on the rogues and hunters dps for the gold than the stockade pauldrons would have for the warriors survivability and threat.  
---
And if we start down that road that you have what if the warrior isn't a raider and he just wants to get more powerful for his dungeons ? Are we going to deem his item upgrade as less valuable since he isn't a raider ? Or the apply that same thought process to rogue hunter shaman and mage if they are or aren't raiders.
---
They worded all their statements very carefully because they plan on keeping layering forever. Might as well start looking into ESO now, boys.
---
I would also probably agree with Destruction Warlock  
---
Honestly, a lot of people (from what I remember) specced arcane and fire for PvP. You cast that rogue pyro blast, a fireball, and then do a pom pyro on top of that and basically people don't have a chance unless a paladin pops a bubble.
---
Did this every day for years. Gotta get that rested xp amirite?
---
I guess a mod deleted it because I called you a cunt.
---
I am still gonna play a fire mage in classic. I love pyroblast and in pve you can cast more than just frostbolt.
---
play some single player games, good ones.
---
A Plague Tale is bloody amazing, check it out.
---
Gnome rogue or dwarf rogue? 
---
Gnome:
---
Pros:
---
+Played gnome rogue in vanilla, so nostalgia
---
+Prefer the look of a gnome rogue
---
+Escape artist
---
Cons:
---
-Hate the mechanostrider
---
-Hearing the gnome voice say “I don’t have enough energy!” Is really annoying. 
---
Dwarf:
---
+Like the ram far more than mechanostrider
---
+Stoneform
---
-Don’t like appearance as much as gnome
---
Basically...gnome character appearance vs dwarf superior mount appearance.
---
So ninjaing items is ok, it just has to be worth enough gold.
---
I hope we never meet in a group.
---
[1h 35min for Warrior in Durotar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzbkqM9xGx4) \- not much difference to Mulgore. The key aspect is to know how to move and what quests to focus on.
---
Great suggestions and insights. Grease the groove sounds like a good idea. 
---
I agree we shouldn't be glued to screens for as long as we are but not everyone enjoys the same things we do. But hopefully someone has a good takeaway.
---
I still do it in BFA
---
I mean  this literally isn't how it works.  Priest with spirit tap lets you pull constantly and constantly be in combat.  With a shaman you will be waiting for the shaman to drink, a lot.  WF is nice but it's not as good as you seem to think it is.
---
First two weeks will likely be a shitshow anyway, you wont miss much by not maximising your game time during them.
---
#nochanges
---
I reckon once it’s out you’ll definitely find some more time, at least at the start. There’s no way I’m waking up in the early hours of the morning before work in this summery heat and not jumping straight onto my computer.
---
So has anyone actually tested this in beta?
---
I got tired of all the fast travel and lobby-based gameplay.
---
I wish. You are just an asshole.
---
In an ideal world, I agree. But not everyone feels the same. No one solution is for everyone.
---
Going to change warrior and pally leveling ALOT it was a key part that allowed them to level faster.
---
Yeah, paladins are awesome fishermen, born talents.
---
I’m interested in that as well. Sell lock pick services for instances is an option as well.
---
I think it is fine at level 3. But it’s been a while.
---
Definitely not better, as it's no meaningful stats over 2xdawns. Besides that, once leaf is available Barbarous Blade is better and easily accessible.
---
It's not ninjaing if you say "all roll need" and people agree. Did you miss the quotation marks and the rest of the conversation there, champ, or just willfully ignore it?
---
Feralas... never liked that zone
---
lmao at wrestling. nobody cares about it.
---
Weird it doesn't mention layer jumping.
---
Well, if you're rolling Horde than I can't really help you there, but Alliance have a fantastic pickpocketing spot in STV. 
---
Which, if you maintain a proper level with the zerg, and dynamic respawns are just fast enough, can prove to be one of the best ways of getting gold in that level range and a sure-fire way to get your level 40 mount.
---
Soon brothers and sisters. Soon.
---
Dwarves look better
---
Can you guys just do a discord remind me for 1 year. Id like to see what you think when they dont remove them.
---
Some of my best memories with this game were when I was in high school and a punk pot head, starting a new character, putting some headphones on, blasting the sound, and really just getting fully enveloped in the world. Good times.
---
So those quotation marks mean discuss this before you start the dungeon? Then I can live with that.
---
I read it as posting that in chat and hit need should something drop, which would be changing the rules mid dungeon (and someone might even have hit greed already).
---
When im tanking i usually explain at the start that if something is an upgrade for you, you roll need. If it's BoE, you equip it right away to show that you rolled need because you need it, not so you can sell it. If you then want to switch back to your previous weapon because its got an enchant, or you need an offhand to make it better than your 2h, or whatever, thats cool, just as long as you've equipped it for all to see.
---
If you roll need then refuse to equip it? Thats a kick, and you're on the ninja list and dont get into any more parties with me.
---
I havent really watched any of them before. Just in the clips on here that occasionally show up and a few on youtube.
---
No, it's nut
---
&gt; big hit
---
My mistake then. Thanks!
---
I feel ya.
---
Go gnome and then get yourself a ram
---
I'm not sure what part of this is confusing for you, not once did I critique individuals for joining said group.  From the onset the message has been quite clear, this sub defends individuals with the mindset of manipulating a group makeup with only their own interests in mind, and such individuals are loathsome.  
---
Did you play Vanilla?  Do you recall the vast amounts of UBRS/raids where such manipulation occurred, or when the item was reserved, and after said item didn't drop the leader DC'd, went AFK, stopped giving a fuck, and the group/raid fell apart?  Or the ones that plain failed because of incompetence while mismanaging the group to obtain for themselves?  Sure, there was, and will be, no lack of incompetence permeating throughout grouping, but one comes from avarice and the other from inexperience.  Are you getting that yet, dolt?  Are you comprehending the concept of labeling vile narcissism to such individuals?
---
Primal Water? 😜
---
My mistake then. I was under the impression that it was only applied once per cast in Vanilla and not per tick.
---
Why does it matter that I replied to a month old post?
---
&gt; crack
---
Drugs are bad m'kay.
---
&gt; They are absolutely not. You are clueless if you claim otherwise.
---
Dude. You are the one clueless if you believe alliance is better than horde in pve, absolutely bonkers.
---
First, The racials are better, Berserking + Bloodfury and axe skill. Only useful one for alliance is human sword &amp; mace + dwarf fear ward. Caster dps berserking beats all, the only roughly 0.5% extra crit from gnomes extra int is nothing, 10-30% haste for 10s (without GCD) is better. Melee DPS, bloodfury 25% bonus (400+ AP with WBuffs), end-game weapons are sword and maces true, alliance has kinda edge, but there are really good axes too. onyxia, dbringer, crul'shorukh, doom's edge, blessed qiraji war axes. Best TPS skill in the game is berserking (trolls). 
---
Tremor &gt; fear ward.
---
Fear ward has CD, single-target. Tremor is aoe, only prob is it pulsates every few seconds. 
---
Windfury totem is way better than anything else. 409 atk power 1.5s incl. weapon swing, rage gain for warriors is insane (both tanks and dps)
---
World buffs are better for horde.
---
Kings is better obv.
---
Salvation, while horde has a weaker one (tranquil air totem-, 20% instead of 30) prob is windfury + salvation but can be worked around.
---
BoM, Wisdom / Horde has strength of the erath totem, grace of air, and mana tide.
---
pallys are great as healers true, dont rly run out of mana, so on so on. But shamans cna aoe via chainheal or t1 set bonus, and also shamans + druids have NS, so typically a horde raid has 8-10 NS while allys have tops 2.
---
Priests + shamans have 25% armor increase buff when thier heals crit.
---
Shamans have Ankh, instead of divine intervention like pallys (who suicides).
---
Horde is far superior if you are a end-game guild. I don't care what you say that's just how it is. The raw numbers are there for horde. DPS ceiling is higher and the shaman totems can be played to be better than anything alliance offers.
---
Alliance has a easier times for casuals with pally buffs
---
Then druid is fine and a more versatile choice.
---
Puff puff pass, that's the rule.
---
nope
---
If you have a choice between an sixth shaman playing enhancement or a real dps class...you go with the latter.
---
Can get another mount for the looks, cant change the look of your race... Go gnome.
---
It was the correct step. With how many levels there are and the game being end game focused (for better or worse) Blizz had to speed up leveling from time to time. This left the game in a state where you would outlevel a zone way before finishing the main story questline of that zone. With level scaling you can now actually finish a zone and it's story.
---
Now the leveling is still pointless and boring in retail but that's a different problem.
---
&gt;one dude in the group can claim he is going to equip it
---
So let him equip it. You can inspect him and see that he has. If he rolls need and refuses to equip it, kick him and put him on the ninja list.
---
People will learn real fast that you dont get into UBRS if youve spent your levelling earning a reputation as a ninja.
---
I was always that little bit disappointed after realising toons auto stand up upon login
---
If we're talking 1-30-ish, need is mostly there because greens may actually be an upgrade, so a random roll for it isn't quite sufficient when someone needs to call priority on something.
---
If we're talking the realm where the only thing we're interested in is blues and purples, every BoE gets needed, and if someone can make their case as to why they should be given the item, then give it to them.  Its pretty basic "don't be a dick, but don't put yourself in a position where someone else can dick you over."
---
yes, layers are everywhere
---
I dropped retail last year for the first proper time. Times before that I had taken breaks but I'm pretty much done with it now.
---
My biggest issue is the story right now. They have butchered the lore completely. Their cinematic technology could be put to better use. Instead it is used for those countless, predictable scenes where the key players get to soapbox a heroic (and corny) speech before the screen goes black. I think I could be more into that if the story wasnt pants. But it is. I have ranted before many times on how I would have written it differently. 
---
WoW used to be driven by its narrative and that was actually a pretty natural thing back in the day for a lot of games. But now producers and shareholders have turned it into a monopoly, so the game isn't built to entertain the same way it was years ago. It has been mutilated to serve a single purpose - make Activision Blizzard as much money as possible. 
---
The game reeks of this mentality. It is insulting. The art team have always done the game justice so they can be exempt from my scald. Retail WoW is a money machine. Everything else is second thought.
---
Shamans don't do 50% dps.  They usually do less damage than the tanks.
---
Blizzard did a huge fucking mistake by giving them a good caster racial. I mean seriously?
---
This should be the first comment. Its so importent. Kind regards, tauren warrior &amp; shaman.
---
Stealth BRD runs if you have mining, stealth BRD runs with a Druid can kill most bosses. DM with a Druid is also great. Stealing Devilsaur can be profitable if you’re specced for it and good at it. Mining in the silithus caves.
---
Disagree. Body weight exercises are a quick and easy way to get fit. Squeezing in sets when you can is perfectly fine. Spending 20 hours a week in the gym is fine, but few people have that kind of time. It’s easy to spend 10 to 15 minutes for calisthenics in a day which will lead to healthier outcomes for more people. 
---
Ps-think you’re also not giving g enough respect to how long you’ll spend in flight lol.
---
Steady shot macro with a scorpid pet when the scorpid poison 5 stacked. Big fucking damage.
---
You don't need a taunt for the purpose of taunt to be fulfilled. A high threat attack can fulfill the same purpose. Earth Shock works well for shamans. 
---
There are other options too, for example, you could have a stun that would accomplish the same thing.
---
It's very restricted and unimaginative to think that taunt is the only way, when you can come up with many ways to accomplish the same thing, that would give the classes different flavour.
---
Im not nochanges either, I can deal with some of the nicer things. But I'd like consistency. If they're going to make so many changes then implement leeway and poor spell batching which in current age are effectively integrated bugs and change class mechanics like hunter pets all under the guise of making it vanilla then I dont get it. They arent giving us vanilla. So say fuck it and give us a remaster and call it what it is, and get rid of the trash changes that are only there to make the game clunky or nuanced or whatever buzz word everyone is using now.
---
Troll warrior is BiS for tanking. The TPS is huge with their racials :)
---
Why is pee any better? Lol
---
Do you see me making threads about such acts?  You can't prevent trash from being trash.  But I will, without hesitation, defend people who dislike like others performing such practices, and will label the practice for what it is.
---
Started alliance, played roughly half n half maybe slightly more horde.
---
I much prefer the aesthetics of alliance cities and with starting there I have some nostalgia too, so easy choice!
---
Essence of water! My bad, been awhile.
---
I'm having a kid in two weeks. This is gonna be tough.
---
Lol
---
Hunter traps being ignored/resisted in PvP were endlessly annoying. However this was not limited to only Vanilla.
---
Same here man
---
Yeah I was skeptical at first, grease the groove sounded like some pseudo science thing but it actually does work and is a real thing. 
---
 Important to remember though is that the number of reps of an exercise should never be the first priority. Form is everything. For example for pull ups the best way you can do them I think is hanging with arms straight, engaging your back musculature, get your whole neck above the bar and then very slowly lowering yourself down to a straight hang again. Doing pull ups this way you will do a lot less than someone who just goes up and down like a yoyo and boasts about how many he can do. He will however not get nearly as much out of the exercise as you do. 
---
 Regarding not everyone enjoying working out. Everyone no matter what they say would like to be in good shape. Training has so many great benefits, people just need to find something that works for them. Everyone should be encouraged to work out for sure.
---
Hm I'll have to double-check but I don't think every bat has ravage?
---
Has anyone done a comparison of how much silver/copper you get pickpocketing on beta vs pservers?
---
For sure, I can get behind consistency, because that is one thing it really is lacking. The stuff implemented from modern WoW seem really arbitrary most of the time. Right-click reporting? Understandable, they don't want to hire GMs. But things like showing cooldowns, but making sure the lamps are right color? Makes little to no sense.
---
What would you get on the lock instead?
---
There's really quite a bunch of people for which flavor is more important than mechanics so while you're probably right there'll be more Troll and Orc hunters than Tuaren hunters, it's a given at launch to be enough of them to make warrior leveling hard.
---
If they remove the ability to use /sit as a ability proc. Why would you ever use /sit
---
I'm scratching the itch with private servers, but yes, I recently bought F1 game and I've done a few races but just cant focus and end up watching Kargoz or Madseason for the classic vids. Its torture.
---
"Hey Boss, I'm not gonna be able to show up this week, must be some sort of virus"   
---
In some people's eyes you wouldn't be lying.
---
Adventure Capitalist. Since its mostly an idle game i feel like its still meaningful to play because i will still be able to start it up once or twice a day during flights and make a few clicks after classic launches. I would be in the same boat as you if i played something just to throw it away end of August.
---
If you can't put in that 16+ hours a day, the game ain't for you...
---
/s
---
Half the Warrior BiS list is BoE items. Stockade Pauldrons, Edgmastwrs, medallion of Grand Marshall Morris, Boots of Avoidance, Alcor’s Sunrazor (which only drops in Blackrock Mountain dungeons and raids). If you want to throw in FR items, Skullflame Shield.
---
Step 0: don't live in an apartment
---
Step 0.5: have money to afford it
---
always funny how dps classes see themselves as not able to farm money via killing mobs
---
Go priest, its what I am doing and that should be reason enough alone.
---
Can always get the AV ram later with rep!
---
Correct, but even if it takes a few months, its better than looking at a race you dont like.
---
I wish it showed a placeholder of your character after you log out in a bed. muh immersion
---
Do you like totems???
---
Etiquette was not only server dependent but group dependent. I've never in my life seen nerds argue over dumber shit than blues, but it happened.  
---
First lesson to learn is "never trust".  That means I don't give a fuck about your sick GF and how this BoE epic will make her feel, or if this 50g rare will be an upgrade for your twink alt, your new main, your sister's boyfriend's cousin's first character.  Never ever trust the old "my alt" needs this trick.  The absurd amount of times I've seen people post shit on the AH hours later without even having the wherewithal to place it on the AH with an alt is staggering.  All BoE epics, all, each, every, the group rolls need.  
---
"It's an upgrade for my main!"
---
"Don't care."
---
Too often an upgrade for a main really means an upgrade from the level 40 mount to the level 60 mount.
---
If the item is highly sought after, everyone should roll need.  If you want to farm the item for yourself, then make some friends and help them do the same.  I can see how such a concept is foreign in today's gaming climate of no talk just meme, but it's the most diplomatic and fair method for handling such matters.  
---
If it's BoP, then quite obviously main spec rolls need, offspec greed.  But then we get the nerds who are back and forth on what their actual main spec is an a whim based on item drops.  
---
Bottom line is that nerds lose their shit over pixels, and it's a never ending struggle to find people who aren't ravenous and insane when it comes to looking cool.  I saw a post many years ago asking for the most common class for raid leaders, the answers varied, but I like my answer of "whichever class can use the current legendary".
---
Still not awful, play much like a pala until then.
---
Desolace.
---
Thanks this is perfect.
---
The cap of any Classic server is 3000 simultaneous players logged in at any given time, they designed the game like that on purpose so that the world would be big enough to feel massive but not big enough to get "lost in the crowd". 
---
If those 3000 are spread out in 5 zones or 50 zones is irrelevant. It's how the game was and how the game should be going forward.
---
Yeah working out from home is very convenient. For a compete rookie though I would say step 1 getting equipment should be just getting a pull up bar. Begin with pulls and push ups for some weeks to get into a routine and not be overwhelmed then continue to add in exercises.
---
full guild party or friend party, then if someone could and would use it... then let them have it...
---
if the party consists of any randoms.. I will be needing it and I expect everyone else to do the same... cuz BoE Blue = Gold and Everyone Needs Gold... sooo yea
---
Other classes with no down time and faster kill rates. Hunter, lock, priest, druid. 
---
Other classes with just faster kill rates, everything but warrior.
---
I'm gonna have me a little weenie roast at teldrasil, a little retconned forshadowing, my personal contribution to the lore.
---
Okay well let me know if you have any actual data beyond anecdotes.
---
this doesn't look that great tbh. lol
---
Elemental shaman is a great choice if you enjoy the feeling like the enemy can't let you free cast in bg's. Free casting elemental shamans do some insane burst. You can go arcane power fire mage and get some nasty burst, but while the elemental shaman doesn't rely on cool downs to do this damage you would. Trading CC for more consistent burst.  
---
If burst is what you love elemental shaman is your spirit animal.
---
Why don't you go on an design your own game that will have millions pay you monthly just be able to play it?
---
I can remind you in 6 months if you want when it's gone
---
You won't see splotches. The whole room lights up. How did it get onto the ceiling, too?!
---
&gt;or playing an interview with Ion and pausing to nitpick things.  
---
That's probably my biggest annoyance. He watches a 5 minute video but it takes 30 minutes because he pauses and nitpicks everything.
---
/tinfoil hat on
---
If there's no decline in population, then layering win stay causing many to leave. The end result will be a decline in population.
---
So not if, but when there is a decline, will Blizzard acknowledge it? They could easily continue to stay silent and keep layering as long as they wish... (Causing a further decline).
---
Is this how you keep retail alive?
---
/tinfoil hat off
---
I’m struggling with this. I believe my group is rolling alliance and I’m playing priest. I feel like I should play dwarf, but NE looks so much better while being the 3rd best option.
---
no not this one, there was one more recent
---
My first guess would be queues and offering free realm transfers, as they used to do on overpopulated servers.
---
Okay? Does that change what has happened after that? Does initiating something give you free reign to behave however you damn well please?
---
I was on servers where everyone rolled need, and then when I did it on my Horde character on the same server the entire UBRS run paused for a 15 minute bitchfest.
---
Yes please do. Then change all the petty downvotes for me ;)
---
Well its good that problast is a 6 second cast then.
---
I know this is the right way to do it, but damn man... I really want that sweet sweet Smoking Heart of the Mountain before 60 but I know it's not going to happen... :(
---
Yes thats what I pointed out. Not sure why I got downvoted.
---
For me it was MoP and the farming dailies and cooking mechanics, I felt like when I came home from work I had to do in game chores everyday.  Essentially the same as WoD wizard chores you mentioned.
---
No. A layer = an entire servers worth of players. 3000 players can be logged in at the same time, which continent they're on is irrelevant.
---
That will be a problem in classic for sure, it will be largely populated by people who have no lifed private servers for years.
---
Everytime I would be in Undercity logging out I would go to the Inn, and sleep in the coffins.
---
People don’t understand what it means to be optimized. Everything else needs to be perfect for your racial ability to have meaningful impact. 
---
Fat fingering a key, missing a single cast, mistiming your energy ticks...these things are likely more impactful to your performance than your race. And let’s face it, if you’re reading this you as a player aren’t optimized enough for your toons race to make a difference.
---
Anyway, to answer your question, for me there are certain race and class combos that I really like the look of or the animations and that gets me excited to log on. I’ve rolled bis on most but sometimes I there are little annoyances that just build up overtime and I finally just don’t want to play those toons anymore. I made that mistake with a female orc lock and male troll priest back in the day. The cast animations on the lock bugged me and I just got sick of looking at the troll in robes. Consequently, they both have been shelved for ages.
---
I see it this way: I doubt Blizzard would have made Paladins and Shamans so unique and strong in their own ways, if they were still faction specific.
---
5x5 Stronglifts and the C25k app. Thats all this nerd needs ^
---
Hadn't given you any down votes but since you're gonna be like that I have now.
---
Great podcast, been listening for a few weeks now!
---
OPist
---
^ This.
---
I have had too many cases of "I need it for my Alt" or "I need it for my healing specc" only to see it end up on the AH.
---
BoE (At least in the groups that I will run) will be a Free for All roll.
---
My GM in Classic used to live in the building next to the bank in IF with the repair guy upstairs. After raid he would AFK there, and the guild would go sit up there and chat until logging off. 15 years later and we still refer to it as "Gazzy's house". Awesome RP!
---
You didn't specify what "regardless of anything" ment.
---
Yeah, I always kind of hoped that they’d give 5 points in your main tier so you have 5 to explore with.
---
You can disable error speech.
---
Yeah. I mean, you move as fast as you do when Xxhunterxx doesn’t know how to turn pack off.
---
It's like you just defined a word, except with your infantile insults, and didn't realize it.
---
People who were in classic beta seem to claim that pickpocket method isnt viable anymore. I wasn't invited to beta, so can't say for sure. I'm just going by what others on this sub have said.
---
All lot of arbitrary numbers you coupled together - nothing of it being credible of course!
---
Wait for somebody to kill the devilsaur and sap/blind them when they start skinning it and skin it yourself. Or try to ninja the skin from your own faction after they loot.
---
Hunter and lock, sure, those are the best levelling classes.
---
Priest has a faster killrate and no downtime? Yeah, right. If you kill fast, you use mana and have downtime. If you have no downtime, you use wands and are pretty slow at killing.
---
Druid has a very similar killrate to paladin.
---
Well, then we have shaman, warrior, rogue and mage left. The only ones, where I'd say the killrate is noticeably faster is mage and maybe ele shaman.
---
Currently on beta you can sit, and AS you are getting hit you stand. Apparently this causes you to be crit, and the game registers you as standing when the crit hits, thus proccing the abilities. It's obnoxious, but currently works this way.
---
Ugh! Totems! If I have more than 4 out at the same time, I feel uncomfortable!
---
1. Yes, im talking about MY experience. But if you read carefully, you will see, that im asking others about their opinion. I dont know why you would think of greed, when im making a thread to DISCUSS,  if it should be implemented or not?? Who says i only care about me? 
---
2. Yes I'd argue that they would implement these out of greed (in a sense of wanting more than needed).
---
Because im sure, they could manage just fine, without the income of the microtransactions.
---
Yes, maybe the changes would help someone to identify more with their character. But beeing able to change everything, means ppl don't focus that much on doing things right and don't have to life with the litle mistakes the've made. And I think (my opinion) if you can't just undo something easily, you will care more about every decision you make, thus you will feel mor immersed.
---
My english skills won't let me explain my opinion more, but i hope you understood what i ment.
---
I agree. But I don't see any better option
---
&gt; I still don't think that need should be used for stuff you intend to sell, as you could just hit need on everything 
---
Yeah, hence why *everyone* rolls need. Value absolutely matters. No-one's going to care about greens that drop 12 times per dungeon and sell for a few silver. But that hot blue item which is worth 50x as much? Selling that is going to bring in so much gold that it'd benefit *any* member of the group so much more. The gold that that one blue brings in could buy a character an entire new outfit. To me, giving *everyone* a shot at that pile of cash so they can improve their character is a way better option.
---
You really gonna tell me that you'd rather a hunter rolls on a Sword that gives him +4 agility rather than someone in the group getting a shot at 500g? There's no rogues or warriors in this group and he does *need* it, after all.
---
Flip a coin.
---
If you don't like the result shown by the coin, you take the opposite.
---
That's basically how I decided what class to play. Should work on faction just as well.
---
There's another thing to consider here. Depending on the size of your server, you may end up in a situation where people can get a reputation for greed in dungeon runs.
---
Hey, Happy Cake day!
---
Will You be dwarf?
---
If the only reason you want to play alliance is because you like the zones, you could main a horde and level an alliance character just for fun.
---
Yeah the spirit doesn't bother me its pretty useless and I think both look great stoneform seems to be the only worth while difference. Casting animations are both good I guess I'll panic on the day and see what happens!
---
Tried to pick up ff14 but the leveling has got to be to most boring leveling experience out of every mmorpg out there. 
---
Only made it to level 17 before I quit.
---
&gt; It's your personal position that makes little sense because you're introducing a completely arbitrary exception.
---
So, you think it would be better if I'd stay stubborn and not accommodate? Sure, your approach is more consistent. My approach is: Need &gt; Greed, but I can understand and tolerate certain reasons to deviate. Namely: Twink BiS gear. Personally, if I was the group leader and everyone would just follow whatever rule I make (just hypothetically), I'd always go for Need &gt; Greed. Very consistent as well. But I accept that I do not live in a perfect world and thus adjust to some degree. Depending on how it goes, I might have to adjust quite substantially and regularly, but I will personally always advocate what I feel to be right. And this is what this discussion is about imo: "What do you think is right?" and my view just happens to disagree with the majority here.
---
&gt; In my eyes, if you're that bothered about every other BOE item you should feel exactly the same about twink stuff.
---
The key difference is, that it is a temporary upgrade that will definitely get replaced in a few levels. And understand now that it might be better to get 300 gold rather than having that temporary upgrade. This is at this moment just a very rational approach.
---
So overall I agree with you, for various reasons "always need" on valuable BoEs is rational. I've had enough game theory to understand this. That does not mean that I find it right in a moral sense. I prefer people cooperating when grouping and giving any item to whoever will actually use it.
---
Leveling as a group of friends and "Quick" in the same sentence. LOL.
---
Ain't gonna happen.
---
I stopped just before 4.1 came out. Early Cata with its hard dungeons and T11 raids was fun, but then Blizzard ruined all of that and I lost interest.
---
They're trying to get me. Always surrounding me. Mocking me with their impulses. 
---
I always wait until they despawn before I go to sleep.
---
The real wall, other than getting 40 people to a raid, is waiting for people to get gear. Vael was difficult because of her "soft enrage". She was a gear check. If your people didn't have the gear she wasn't dying.
---
I know, but the TPS is very barely different (unless you have thunderfury, but I won't MT so idk) compared to an Orc with weapon skill. It's a much smaller difference than the difference between pvp and dps orc/troll.
---
That being said, classic is an RPG and I will treat it as such. The character should be an extension of me and I don't mind doing 5% less dps to achieve that.
---
Hi all! I’ve been narrowing down my class choice for classic all summer and I’m stuck between just two.  Long comment but I am really close to making a choice. I just need some help finishing the decision. 
---
I started summer with 5 potential choices - one of the five meta raid dps classes. I’ve eliminated warrior, rogue, and hunter for several reasons and am now stuck between MAGE and WARLOCK. And when I say suck, good god I mean it. I cannot seem to choose. 
---
I’ll tell you guys about my wants/needs and what I see as pros and cons for both mage and lock:
---
I am going to play horde, 100%. My current plan for classic is to focus on pvp and raids. To be  more specific, world pvp of any sort will be my focus and I will use raiding to get geared and help me dominate in PvP. Also to see the content. Only reason I’m willing to play a caster in raiding in classic is because of how fun they are in PvP. PvP is my favorite thing to do and what I will spend my free time not farming doing. I will casually BG sometimes but I will not take the time to farm honor or rank up. Yes, I know about the respec cost. Now for some pros and cons.
---
Mage PROS: the quality of life of a mage is unmatched due to water, portals, cc and others. Mages are top tier in all forms of PvP for all of vanilla, and as I said, pvp is my focus. I find mage playstyle so fun in pvp. So much control and finesse and outplay potential, it’s super fun and rewarding for getting good at. Mages are great in raids. Mage is desirable for dungeons which makes pre bis easier. All around seems very strong. I feel mage is a very safe, reliable choice across the board for these reasons. Not that gear reliant, so even if I decide I don’t have time to raid I could still probably be okay. Free spell hit and threat reduction is amazing and makes life way easier in pve. 
---
Mage CONS: I fear there will be a shitload of mages running around and I’ll be playing one of the most populated classes. I do not enjoy leveling the mage because frostbolt, nova kite frostbolt is not fun to me and aoe farming is unrealistic for classic unless layering is REALLY generous. I do not enjoy the way mage tier sets look. And overall mage is not my favorite theming in wow, I’d be choosing it purely for gameplay and mechanics but not for the actual flavor. I don’t dislike mage flavor, but it doesn’t stand out to me the way lock theming does. 
---
Warlock PROS: I find locks far more fun to level than mage. Mana efficient if can be healed. Wanted for parties. Absolute beasts in PvP once geared - I would love to farm our tier 2 and play soul link world PvP vs multiple people at once. This class has my favorite theme/flavor in wow and my favorite tier sets in all of vanilla. Summons can be a pain in the ass but imo it’s worth it, makes your runs get started so much faster. Free mount at 40. Useful to raid besides just damage, which late vanilla is LOTS. I don’t mind farming soul shards. Less raid spots also mean I get tier sets faster than let’s say mages, which every raid will have like 8 rolling on gear. 
---
Warlock CONS: I fear that enough people understand classic better than we used to that on horde side, lock is actually super popular. Especially looking at the polls and such from this sub. And locks need less raid spots. I’m also concerned that I have no innate threat control like mage. That seems like a huge disadvantage. I also feel like pvp would be great once I get gear, but I’m very afraid of the fresh 60/pre bis/tier 1 stages for pvp. Like, how bad IS it before I get in BWL gear? Do people exaggerate it, or are warlocks truly mushrooms early on? I fear that I’d choose lock for the flavor and visuals and leveling fun and then regret it at 60 when mages are so much stronger at fresh 60 (if that’s true) and I struggle to find a raid spot due to how many horde locks there are. Also, I’ve never pvped as a lock in classic so I am not 100% certain I’d enjoy it, but I know with certainty that I enjoy mage pvp already. 
---
Phew! Thanks for reading and hope you can provide some insight for me.
---
Look at what race you want to play the most?
---
No good mage kept playing arcane after they got t6.
---
30% longer will put them over the enrage timer, and wipe the raid. Many of classic's bosses were gear checks with very tight enrage timers.
---
Give that sucker a racer car seat and I'd buy it.
---
Nice
---
At least i know I’m going alliance because of my friends
---
You should try to get Deep Rock Galactic! It is an amazing four player coop survival game similar to Vermintide and L4D. It has amazing devs and is great fun.
---
Hell yes!  I played an undead mage in vanilla, would always hearth to undercity and find a coffin to sleep in!
---
Did not knowbl that. Thanks!
---
3000 concurrent players? Yes they can absolutely do that.
---
20,000? That won't be the concurrent player amount after launch
---
ew resto
---
..that's the exact opposite of ninja looting. How on earth is it sneaky to announce you are going to need BOE and then need BOE? If you are stupid enough to disagree with a groups loot rules, but still join the group, the fuck do you expect?
---
I didn't but mainly because I played some much vanilla that I would just find the nearest rest spot and logoff immediately.
---
Looks like the transatlantic cable with the lowest latency is about 54ms round trip from new York to Ireland, and if they have servers in Boston that would be about...6700km from Frankfurt
---
Mages peaked in t5 when they went arcane. Prior to that Hunters were top dogs. In t6 and above it was all about locks.
---
Wanna try this build out aswell, as it has the maximum control kit with the additional pet stun. What I dont like about it is that you can't get the additional 10% more health. But since I'm gonna do pve aswell I probably won't walk around a lot with this build and rather stick to the regular 4/31/16 for PVE and PVP.
---
Thanks. I don't know why people took such offense to me just asking. I wasn't doubting it or anything I just wanted to see it but was also at work and couldn't look it up.
---
It´s not like the wall of no posters suddenly disappeared. Blizz will never do classic. Ok, but it will take forever. Ok, but it will be released in a retail content drought. Ok, but 80% of players will leave anyways and it will fail. This is where we are now.
---
I'm replaying dark souls 1. I never did Oolacile or killed artorias on my first playthrough nor have I gone darkwraith yet. I'm also messing around with weapons I normally don't use like the bastard sword, the partizan, and the halberd. That, and I recently got back into M:TG and reconnected with some old friends that play too. The 26th will be here sooner than you think. Enjoy life until then.
---
I'm guessing that no PUG groups will exist within a couple months after a release of new content. Not because a PUG couldn't clear it, but because people are too protective over their loot and don't want to risk losing a piece over a dice roll, they want to be guaranteed a piece via DKP (or equiv).
---
Most guilds get super bent out of shape (justifiably) if one of their raiders gets locked for current raid content from joining a PUG too.
---
It's an old list, the updated post can be found here:

I've felt like this the whole year, but recently started playing Spiderman on the PS4. I think the fact that this year hasn't had as many good games as the last two years also factors in.
---
Pick lock. Never get peace on mage.
---
My friend and I had a secret house we fought over all the time. It was in ironforge in the mystical quarter or whatever (been a long time) if you’re facing the portal/mages guild, it’s the house in the corner on the left with a cool bear statue in it. Was on Rexxar, I was a gnome rogue. My friend was a night elf rogue. TOM if you’re reading this I miss you bro! Used to /sleep every night before I myself went to bed. Comforting to know my rogue was asleep too!
---
What a complete shit reply.  He said he has experience tanking Vanilla already and you take a tone like he has no idea what he’s getting himself into... and then telling him he’s thinking too far into the future like this is a bad thing?  
---
Come off it dude.
---
vanilla never had dynamic respawns. thats purely a privat server/retail thing
---
Min-maxing isn't required unless you are racing for world firsts etc.... Simple as that really. There is no encounter that your class choice will define whether you can complete it or not.
---
I was going to go troll mage but I'm thinking undead now.... Decisions, decisions, decisions!
---
Wish my friends were willing to be this versatile. Instead I have a group of five friends all rolling pure dps classes.  And they expect us to play together, these are vanilla vets, they've been on p servers etc, so they are aware. 
---
And they tried to con me into making a tank so we can pve together. Meanwhile the rest of em are making dps....
---
I'd love to rock your set up
---
Office reference
---
Right, but we have a data point that the vanilla caps did an excellent job of building server communities. It's entirely possible that double that would still be good, but it feels like a risky change for very little reason.
---
Poor bastard.
---
&gt;  just a 29yo tool with body dismorphia  
---
How refreshingly honest. A like to you!
---
Most men get fat from age 27 onwards, if they weren't fat to begin with. Until 27 you can look alright while going to the gym and eating junk - after that the junk catches up.
---
I do an hour of full body circuits every other day and use downtime in game to talk to people ... that's what the downtime is actually for, you know.
---
Alright anyone willing to help me out w this dilemma? Any comments are welcome
---
I’m going to be playing around ~20 hours a week give or take, sometimes wayyy more sometimes a bit less depending on how the weekends go. I'll be leveling here and there with a shadow priest and mage possibly. We're alliance. I've always been more of a pve oriented (questing, dungeons, raids) but I'm rolling a pvp server so I'm sure I'll experience my fair share of world pvp. I’ll be in a guild from the start. I'm currently torn on what to roll as my main and my alt. I'm stuck between warrior/rogue/warlock.
---
General notes: I've always been partial to melee dps, using swords/axes/maces, leather/plate armor. I'm also a huge fan of class quests because it makes me feel a sense of class identity and uniqueness to my character, going through something that many other players don't go through, so whichever class has the coolest/most interesting class quests might also win me over.
---
Warrior: I like the idea of always being able to find a dungeon, dungeons are one of my favorite aspects of the game, especially since I'm going to be with a priest so locking down a group should be trivial to us. Again, the leveling process as a warrior is definitely made way more tolerable with consistent healing from a pocket which is nice as well. I like to be a leader and shot-caller and warrior fits the bill. I love all the weapons available to a warrior and the mail and plate.
---
Couple concerns I have with warrior:
---
1) I've been told they are incredibly gear dependent and expensive as shit to gear. I'm going to invest a solid amount of time into my main, but nothing compared to the rank 14 grinders. I'll most likely be running dungeons constantly as a warrior so I'll definitely have ample blues, but I'm worried about the gearing process over time. I want to enjoy the experience to 60, not make it a complete shitfest until I’m geared to the teeth post BWL. 
---
2) Terrible at wpvp. Everyone says that warriors blow at world pvp, that theyre easily kiteable, etc. I'm hoping that with a priest I'd be formidable enough to win some battles out in STV but I'm definitely worried about getting the shit ganked out of me if I'm ever alone or even w the priest
---
3) Most common class by far, I like to stand out.
---
Rogue: Completely opposite to the warrior, I'd be fearsome in world pvp. Hopefully along with the spriest, we'd be terrifying out in the open world and be consistent levelers. I like the stealth/poisons aspect. Great in pve as well and always lights up the charts. Big single target damage. I like the self sufficiency a lot and the rotation is appealing to me.
---
Concerns for rogue:
---
1) Rogues are a little less common than warriors, but are still a dime a dozen especially on a pvp server. They have significantly more trouble finding groups as they are pretty one dimensional but hopefully I’ll be able to compensate by using my priest to get in groups
---
2) Apparently gearing a rogue is very tough, but they are less gear dependent than warriors which helps.
---
3) Orc stun resist is broken
---
4) Pretty much 0 utility, aside from throwing in a sap here and there
---
Warlock: I like the class flavor a lot. Summoning, pets, so many spells to use in different situations. Cool class quests. Has their niche in raids but only gets realllly good in later patches. Solid in wpvp. Possibly some synergy with the shadow priest with shadow weaving buffs? 0 downtime because of life tap.
---
Concerns:
---
1) competing over gear w the priest. Still good option for an alt.
---
2) AoE and spells are not as potent as a mage's but still hopefully hellfire / rain of fire is still decent? Can't farm as well as a mage
---
3) Being a summoning bitch might get annoying after a while
---
4) will of the forsaken
---
The main thing I don't know about these classes is play style. How hard is each one to master? Which one would be best suited as my main given my situation/concerns? Which would be best suited as my alt? Let me know.
---
It's literally the source code, dude.
---
I've played extensively as both horde and ally. Mates are all going horde so naturally, I'll be going horde as well.
---
Standing on the org mailbox for me :)
---
Find a single player game you've been meaning to play and power through that. 
---
I'm finally going to finish God of War (PS4)
---
What use has your comment?
---
I'm keeping OP's expectations realistic. Thankfully the farther in-game we get, and the more phases come out. The easier it will be to tank, and the more tanks will be needed on rotation. I'm simply explaining that they won't be able to tank their guild's first MC with a bunch of enthusiasm and prior knowledge of tanking in other MMOs.
---
Becoming an MT is a very grueling, time-consuming process; and the position will be filled well before anyone reaches 60.

Life would be a hollow shell of its former glory without this poscast.
---
In-game it was Stormwind Keep, the manual did not get the updated name in-time.
---
For all those vanilla/private server shamans. How cumbersome was totem management? 
---
I was a rogue and priest during vanilla but am really considering shaman for classic. More than likely resto but maybe elemental.
---
Well if the orange evolved from the apple and a lot of people that like orange never tried apple now wants to try apples and he thinks a lot of those people browse this subreddit, his post makes more sense.
---
Yea. School was unavoidable. You had to get good sleep, go to class, pay attention, study etc.... But work? Vacation time baby.
---
As pointed out Lordaeron wasn't a concept yet, and when it was Lordaeron was the name of the kingdom. The name of the capital city was "Capital City" (yes, really).
---
Me for the past 4-5 years. Even before classic was announced. Even my girlfriend who doesnt game or really care much for gaming notices that I start games and never go back to them. I sometimes think if gaming is even a hobby of mine anymore.
---
To derail and troll your thread because he doesn't like it.
---
Yes, the World of Warcraft subscription will allow you to play the "Retail" version of the game as well as WoW: Classic. 
---
On the BNet launcher its all under "World of Warcraft" but there is a drop-down menu above the play button to select retail or classic similar to selecting Beta vs Non-beta versions of a game.  
---
Do note that Classic will require a separate installation.
---
&gt; that is funny because every mmo on the market (edited to say released after wow to take advantage of load balancing and full servers) has multiple servers and shards to handle people logging into an area.
---
That's a big part of the reason I don't play MMOs anymore. After I quit WoW in MoP I tried SWTOR. No real community, in part because the zones did not require or encourage much player interaction and in part because the layering system separated players. Tried ESO and it had similar problems with layering. I was excited about Classic in large part because it was going to be a return to one cohesive world.
---
Pre normalization and Drs they were very op after that they are very niche, good at 1v1s every few minutes and good at locking a healer down long enough to get a kill and good at stalling.
---
I hope a lot of people like you end up playing because I think it'll add to the lifespan of the game. Compared to players who will be no-lifing to 60 and burning thru that end-game(me included), I'd hate to see a huge player drop-off because everyone ran out of stuff to do.
---
I plan on making numerous alts and will still need many other people to play with. And if I burn-out and take a break, it's nice to know there will still be players around when I wanna come back. 
---
Ultimately, I feel like having enough players from every situations will be the best for the game's social environment as a whole.
---
I guess someone is a [liar](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsmu8x/kevin_jordan_confirms_that_dynamic_respawns/)
---
So basically we should trust the feels from guy that made the game 15 years ago instead of the reals from the guys making the game again right now
---
Thanks. I have now more cancer than a warrior vs 5 affliction warlocks would have
---
So I've changed my mind once again. I'll be making a Gnome Mage as my main, but I love to heal so I'm not sure what kind of alt I should make. 
---
Dwarf Paladin or Night Elf Druid? 
---
I like that Paladin's heal so effortlessly, but hate that they have to mediocre melee hits. 
---
Whereas Druid can heal well by downranking, but just not as efficient. Yet can do decent dps in PvP with Moonglow spec. 
---
I guess, which would be better to have on the Alliance side in both PvP and PvE that could also compliment my Mage main?
---
Yes. You can play all the way up to the last expansion, so Legion. You'd have to buy Battle for Azeroth.
---
And I don't recommend buying BfA.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? I didn't understand a thing you just said.
---
Mulgore is super empty compared to the other starting areas, the best options for sure.
---
I don't intend to come off harsh but just to give my brutal honest opinion here, you are WAY over thinking this all.... Yes I understand gaming can be time consuming, especially wow and more so wow classic. I am in your same exact shoes, I am sooo pumped for wow classic and when I played vanilla back in the day I was in middle school and had all the time in the world. Now a days is a complete 180 and I'm lucky if I get to hop on for even a 30 minute session of gaming. In the end I am still gonna sub again and whatever gaming I get in I'm gonna love. Whether it's a quick 30 minute session of barely getting anything done or a full random day were I have the whole day to myself. Relax, sub for wow classic, and just enjoy it. It might take you forever to get to the end result you want but you are gonna have so much fun doing it and that work you had to put in will make it worth it.

Gothic 2! It’s clunky, it’s buggy, the graphics was almost low standard back then, the UI is strange but the game, the world, the music and voice acting! Oh my!! It’s really some atmosphere over the game that is hard to explain. 
---
It’s from 2002 so just before WoW hit us and I remember thinking that WoW was the perfect replacement for me after playing Gothic 2 with expansions back in 2004. Almost like WoW was the multiplayer version of Gothic 2. 
---
The same guys did the excellent game Risen about 10 years later and it also has the same kind of atmosphere to it but with better graphics. 
---
Gothic 1 has an even stranger UI and I would recommend Gothic 2 first.
---
&gt;  The correct thing to do was make rolling need on boes bind them. 
---
ha, I like this
---
Bandwidth is not the equivalent of stability or consistency. 
---
I work in IT. Broadband adoption was around 60% in 2005. Regular interrupts, bottlenecks, and connection spikes were much more common 15 years ago.
---
Thanks. I almost fell for it tbh
---
To be honest I disagree here.
---
The heroic dungeons had so much more for you to offer and to consider depending on your group setup. Obviously that falls behind once people got T5 and was (mostly) negligible with t6. But the 5 man dungeons stand way above anything that classic has. From variation of crowd control over you kiting and charging in different directions to mitigate damage spikes (those damn dogs in shattered halls still give me PTSD whenever I see them during timewalking, freaking non-elites hitting harder than a couple of raid bosses)
---
As for marks hunters. Unless you were playing a 4:3 or 2 melee dive rotation in classic you actually had something to do and optimize in BC instead of the vanilla  'one aimed shot, one multi and then afk for 6-7 seconds' rotation
---
Yea sounds like fucking misery. I can't even imagine working 5 days a week. Fuck that. Work 5 get 2 off? What the fuck can you do in a 2 day window? You can't really go anywhere for more than 24 hours with travel time.
---
That's why you just never pay them back :)
---
Get help.
---
Started playing wow more than 14 years ago as horde and I'll die as horde
---
If everyone would commit to selling the item and sharing the profit, that would be ideal. I'd 100% do that if we agreed on it. But reading through this post I am not sure that others would do the same.
---
The Untold
---
Or to simply point out that comparing the two is a pointless exercise as they're both completely different and aimed at entirely different audiences.
---
People that prefer one will vehemently defend it as the best over the other. There's not an objective winner because (surprise) preference of flavour is subjective.
---
\^\^too bad the hallmark of a WoW player is FULL IMMERSION BABY 25 HOURS/DAY. MAHHHH MORE HOT POCKETS!
---
yeah we're all addicts
---
In 1v1 pvp the warlock is King.
---
For group wpvp mages are the best.
---
Every time. Why learn commands like /sit, /sleep, etc if you won’t use em.
---
Eh, not really. Getting to end-game is already long enough with how high the level cap is. It allows players to choose their own quest path instead of doing the same couple times every time. You can also group with people not close to your level and still contribute fairly evenly. Wouldn't have really worked pre 120 cap.
---
You can easily get a ram as a gnome from AV
---
druids in cat form have the same kill speed as rogues, which is pretty much the same as paladins.
---
Druids aren't fast levellers because they kill quickly, they are because they can kill in cat form, then heal themselves up and quickly move to the next mob. They also get travel form at 30. They are fast because of their movement speed and and no downtime, ont because they kill mobs quickly.
---
Well, i know what you are going to blame, when you get killed in pvp.
---
My undead rogue would always find a coffin to sleep in.
---
With today's technology setting up different servers should be easily done. I don't get it.... private servers can have 4 active servers and have a high population on 2 of them yet blizzard wants everyone to migrate to one server. What happens to layering on low pop servers?
---
You won't be tanking in raids if you are not consistently there.
---
Literally did this last night as I logged off.
---
The only thing that comes to mind is raid tier design so it doesn't directly go against a specific spec. Mages were not that thrilled to have a fire and a frost immune boss in the same raid tier (alar, hydross)
---
Aside from that. Your question just reaffirms my point. classic is a stepping stone to get the polished product. TBC servers in 2-3 years!
---
Is the class that can kite indefinitely complaining about melee leeway!? 
---
“BUT BLIZZARD IM NOT ALLOWED TO LOSE!!!”
---
Trash darnassus inn has no pillows on the beds and worst of all DOESNT EVEN HAVE 4 WALLS. It’s not an inn, it’s a campsite. We will never be returning, the innkeeper was also rude to me because of my race, 1/5 stars
---
I just finished rewatching The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. My cravings for high fantasy are at an all time high. Although I'm suddenly wishing my friends were going alliance so I could play a dwarf.
---
I still play some retail,  Overwatch, and Octopath Traveler now that its on PC.
---
You'd bet right my dude
---
No offense, but the purpose of this sub isn’t really to discuss classic vs retail and figure out what you should play.
---
Not to mention that your comparison is completely subjective and informed by nothing other than your own opinion, some of which is extremely far reaching in an attempt to be insightful.
---
Is your friend planning on going feral for endgame content? Reddit has a lot of opinions about feral druids; some are accurate, many are not. If he is even considering it he should come by the druid discord and get an informed look at the pros and cons. You can also dm me if you like.
---
Other than that the comp is very strong for low level dungeoning and questing. As others have said the priest and lock will have gear demand overlap but it won't be insurmountable.
---
Not only did I do this, but I also tried to line my character up perfectly so it looked legit like I belonged there.
---
So, I got this too and immediately turned it on.  
---
Mind you I haven't logged into WoW since BC. Most of my characters are still in their vanilla sets level 61 or 62.  I have a few 70s but what was weird for me is seeing 'legacy set' on many of my characters and I didn't understand the skill trees at all.
---
I have been flying around looking at the cata changes more overwhelmed than anything else.  Fun to actually get inside the game before classic comes out but this current version of WoW is not for me.  It's also VERY weird flying in vanilla areas.
---
It was different on each server I played on in Vanilla. Good luck getting one definitive answer or even everyone on your same server to go along. Just get some clarity in chat from the party leader before starting your dungeon.
---
My fellow rp, I salute you.
---
Came here for this, I've got a pic of my vanilla mage sleeping in a coffin around here somewhere
---
That just doesn't sound like what I want out of a game. I like the "choose your path" but am very much against mobs scaling with your level. I still feel like it ruins world immersion, maybe... Character immersions.
---
I would say 9 days /played is less time than  the “average” player would spend leveling to 60, for what it’s worth.
---
The kobold story was a complete joke. I think he was nervous because he was being raided by a 10,000 people-sized Asmon raid and he tried to make up an entertaining story to get chat going. He just doesn’t have the right temperament to entertain Asmon’s viewers though. I think if you watch enough of him he definitely has ebbs and flows (just like anyone), and you can start to understand why his firing was “not unwelcome”. He just wasn’t passionate anymore, and couldn’t give his full attention. His power at the company had waned and the game was moving in a direction he opposed. I actually relate to this from my experience at a start-up, and understand it pretty well. Besides, it may not be true, but what does it matter why he got fired? His ideas that he shares are the same either way.
---
I'll always say this to my group because I'm not a greedy fuck. If an item drops and you can USE IT AND YOU WILL USE IT, roll need on it. I don't care if it's blue epic or rainbow speckled. However, if I check the AH later and see that it's up for sale, I will find you and the entire world of warcraft will know of your thievery. 
---
That is the purpose of community in WoW Classic. These little shit head ninjas should be granted the opportunity to ninja, so we can find them early and prevent them from being in a guild.
---
It's 2019, I highly doubt there WON'T be a site for reporting verified ninja looters for ALL to see. It should be a thing. Someone make it.
---
Hahah oke. Well discuss... What do you think is far reaching and subjective? I think its the right sub and I noticed allot of people having these insecurity's about Classic
---
Talk shit better.
---
It's a shame you didn't manage to compare the two objectively. Which is only fair because fun isnt objective but very much subjective. 
---
Old raid content in vanilla only stayed relevant for two reasons: farming for gold when content was on farm and needing better gear before applying to better guilds. There was no real need (maybe someone needed an upgrade here or there) to go back to MC when you were busy in AQ40.
---
What are you talking about? A ret paladin is a fine pvp spec and generally considered stronger than a moonkin. 
---
By going paladin, you'll also get a very different playstyle in pvp than with your mage. A moonkin feels quite similar to a mage. You could of course also go feral druid and get a different plastyle.
---
So, if you'll get good results with both. It's just what you prefer. When it comes to what is better? Paladins are generally considered the stronger class and regarding pvp both classes don't have a high reputation. Druids are mostly sought after as flag carriers in warsong and as a paladin, you'll likely get quite a few comments as to why you are not healing.
---
I used to do this on the boat from Auberdine to Theramore!
---
It’s not that BC mages were bad - it’s that warlocks and shadowpriests became better in every single way. There was no reason to being a mage.
---
I'd say go for Warrior. With a priest, you will absolutely wreck face in WPvP, and that more than makes up for the few times you may get ganked alone. Teaming up with the priest also means that you can put together the group and chose DPS you don't compete for gear with, allowing you to gear up pretty well. This will also help a ton in WPvP, nothing is more scary than a warrior well equipped for his level. And since you say that you like running dungeons, it should be OK for you to run then a couple of time to get all the gear you need.
---
A combat swords rogue is also pretty good paired with a priest, but not to the same extent. And even though YOU put the party together, you will still compete with the warrior tank for weapons.
---
Same in retail, always standing up on log in
---
&gt; Most guilds that can clear aq40 can clear naxx
---
Gear and skillwise yes.  In terms of discipline and dedication to farming obscene amounts of consumables every week, not so much.
---
Twinks
---
Rage was definitely nerfed, but I don't recall them nonviable  just super mediocre. Thats just off my memory however and could be wrong.
---
yeah back in high school, I had 3 sports to do, school, I still chased girls
---
now I have a job with a flexible schedule and... yeah thats it
---
LIVE TO WIN!
---
Back then people had addons that did nearly there same thing the spell queue does.
---
always funny with noobers thinking that good money making methods involves just killing mobs.
---
Fuck yeah role-playing! I didn't do this all the time but it felt like the only true way to get "rested" XP.
---
Damn this sub is getting me pumped for classic.
---
I dunno why but I just don't like pyroblast that much in classic. The 6 second cast time on it really kills it for me. I like PoM paired with it. The skill on its own feel strange to use in a bg.
---
LOL OOPS
---
Basically the entire this is subjective. The fact that you try and call it objective is actually hilarious.
---
And the whole retail vs classic loyalist is pretty much total bullshit.
---
It’s completely obvious that you prefer classic so you presented the information in such a way that classic “won” in every category, and this is coming from someone who loves classic.
---
Burning crusade was horribly unbalanced, i would say from a pvp standpoint the most un balanced the game ever was. Affliction locks and restro druids were prolly the 2 most op versions of any spec ever. As for getting worse, i dont really think anyone got worse.
---
I can't give a definitive answer, but I can state a pro with mages being able to use the same spec (frost) for leveling, PVP and raiding for the most part.
---
This will be done for a lot of servers already, because it's a fun thing and wikis are easy to edit and write down info. Just like a lot of servers have great amount of information from vanilla through WLK, after that it seems to have dropped.
---
Which isn't strange since WoW went from being community driven to semi-afk button spamming with randoms.
---
Me and my friends will try and help build a great community on which ever server we end up on (plz RP-PvP!) and having it's history is quite nice. 
---
But players on each server will have to update this regularly them selves.
---
I'm sorry if I was confusing, I meant, in healer spec, aka Holy, you tend to not really be a damage dealer. 
---
But you're actually very right, I could go a hybrid route and have both dps and healer gear to do both as a Paladin!
---
I agree. This needs to be a thing.
---
Lmao yes
---
Yup, I call it a "Video game depression" where no games I play I really enjoy, and get bored with them very quickly, that is, until I saw another one of these threads (we're not alone) and tried Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark. If you liked Final Fantasy Tactics, this is a great successor. Ignore the terrible graphics though. Ive played about 40 hours so far and I think I'm nearing the end.
---
Agreed, but I would asterisk the statement by saying in a hardcore guild, it will be hard for them to raid.
---
Any casual and some semi-hardcore guilds probably wont mind taking a bear tank, shadow priest, or cat dps if the player is good at it. 
---
You're not going to be the main tank as a bear, and you're probably going to be closer to the bottom than the top on dps for most fights as cat dps, same with shadow, but you do bring SOME utility that non-hardcore guilds may be willing to accept.
---
Shadow priests arent the TBC version of themselves in vanilla, but bringing one isnt horrible. They're still useful for their shadow damage debuff to bosses. A more hardcore guild will make you a disc/shadow hybrid spec but a more casual guild will accept you being shadow and be fine.
---
Skarm is a player who loves tanking and has done all 3 classes I believe (Paladin, Warrior, Bear). He makes a good argument for Bear tanks that, while they may not be your MT, the are decent OT's that can tank just fine. A lot of Bear tanking gear is pre-bis stuff with a few MC/BWL upgrades at the start. Then ZG gets you more good gear and then AQ40 really buffs you up. But the point here is, because your pre-bis is good for the first two raids really, you arent difficult to gear up and be good enough to tank a lot of the stuff in these raids. 
---
Again, would a guild rather have a warrior? Yes. But can a bear do in a pinch? You bet. 
---
Overall though, I think the group comp of this is fine, especially because of the lock. Being able to summon people places as a group of 3 is really going to help increase the groups efficiency and play.
---
The sad thing is, if as a group they're looking to all raid, then ideally the Shadowpriest should play a mage or a warlock, and the druid should probably play a warrior or rogue, but if they want to level up and have fun and play at a casual pace, their comp should be just fine and they should run into little trouble.
---
That's a lot of illiterate action going on their.  Ohh?  Shaman?  Makes sense now.  Bein Horde be hard wit words.
---
Although this is correct, keep in mind that leveling engineering to the point of using sappers and these things has never been overly expensive, and the most logical path would be to level Gnomish and craft your death ray/net-o-matic/boots/mind control hat and then just relevel engineering and go Goblin (assuming the specialization switching isn't in at release).
---
Wrath was terrible
---
Its funny because over 1
---
Million accounts have been made on private server and i have not seen 1 person mention it as a problem the last 4-5 yrs on private servers. 
---
You will be fine
---
Very well done!
---
Dwarf. I'd argue stoneform is better than escape artist. The 0'5s cast time on escape artist is annoying, and you can get the same effect from improved sprint, which I think is an amazing talent.
---
You’re not alone. When I was younger I would find the nearest inn and sit down for 10-15 minutes and just take in my surroundings before going upstairs and logging off. The few Dwarvish inns in the game were always my favorite, the ones in Northrend a close second.
---
You lost me at *honest dialog*
---
&gt;I don't understand that even in actual Vanilla WoW tons of people dropped off within a month or two.
---
There, I quoted you on that. Sure, in real Vanilla, more people were buying the game each month and numbers grew overall. But with Classic, the core population for the game already exists. The vast majority of people that will ever play the game are going to want to try it within the first couple weeks of release. If they have a bad experience either because they can't roll on their friend's server, or they have to wait in long ass queues, or they can't get anywhere because way too many people in the zone they are not going to stick around. Layering is there to try to give these people a good experience so they will keep playing.
---
&gt;I also for some reason think that a game companies would spend hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of dollars on a game that they want to fail.
---
There's another quote from you, brilliant.
---
&gt;People that haven't played in 5 months shouldn't be counted as people not playing any more because they'll totally be back in month 6.
---
Another amazing quote. I'm so glad I quoted you on all this. You're clearly more intelligent and well informed than the average person.
---
&gt; Do the Dwarf quests, get exalted, buy ram
---
Won't work, you need to do many cloth turnins as well before reaching exalted.
---
Imagine wanting layering in a multi massive online game... these kids in 2019 are so dumb and entitled. Their words and thoughts make absolutely no sense what so ever.
---
I think u/northshorebestshore put it perfectly for ya. My addition is, since it seems you've already done a decent amount of research, to measure the cons you would be willing to live with and those which you wouldn't be able to stomach. 
---
For example if melee gameplay is much higher as preference than ranged, obviously drop the warlock; if you must make fast dungeon groups - pick warrior; etc. 
---
Thing is every class will have its drawbacks, so as you've put it, don't overthink and just intuitively pick what sounds best to you.
---
Yup, I've taken to just grinding out WoW tokens for Classic game time with the last of my subscription, i have 11 days left to lazily get another one.
---
To clarify, this was how it was often done in vanilla, to prevent ninja looting in vanilla.
---
If we’re going off of Dyatlov then the next step is that it is, in fact, very popular while they sit there insisting “no, it’s not really popular. That is impossible!”
---
I loved to do this in every dwarven inn! Those rooms are so cozy and well decorated. My character clearly got more rest due to my log location in the inn.
---
There is always another rogue who will do it for free to level the skill or just because it's easy.
---
Looking forward to crossroads barrens chat winterspring and the grief fest that will be stv. 
---
Not looking forward to stone talon or durator
---
30% spell haste every 3 minutes.
---
You wanna hear something sad? 
---
I am in the middle of completing RDR2 story now (cuz i know once classic hit i will never get around to do it) and all im thinking about is Classic while running around on my horse lol
---
The rest of your guild was just bad DPS or severely undergeared compared to you.
---
Not hard. Roll 30/0/21 and keep a healing set of gear and heal. They'll be people commenting "you gotta be resto you gotta be resto" ...you do not.
---
Can you keep 100% attendance, and always be there for your guild with only 3-4hrs playtime ?   
---
if not MT or OT might be a problem. Guilds needs tanks that can put time in and devote to the guild.   
---
If you cant they will just replace you for someone who can be there. For all lockouts and occational extra 20man raids.
---
Afaik the level is just a number after. So you would write /who c-priest 40-60 to list all priests between 40-60.
---
Thanks Josh!
---
the history of the realms are gonna be like,
---
day 92:  the 32nd level 58 was born today.  We celebrated and carried them through raid attunement. After much trial and hardship we managed to banish the elemental Baron Geddon, tonight we dream of victory.
---
day 93:  phase 2 has begun.  Today, Asmongold has transferred to our realm.  The Molten Core was conquered in under an hour, it's told that he had been farming it for weeks on the streamer realm.
---
you got more rested XP if you /sleep on the bed.  Everybody knew that /s
---
Yeah making it too complication /who 40-50 would do it now I think about back in the day.
---
Appreciate the help!
---
I really enjoy both! Both play styles are great but I don't have a reference at performance during phase one in world PvP :(
---
I have a herniated disc.  You can still train when you have issues.  Just need to strengthen everything around it.
---
S: 545 B:365 D:585 @ 200lbs bw
---
Freedom units of course.
---
-I think you're greatly overestimating the demand for Mage/Warlock Tier loot in raids. For most players it tends to be low in priority compared to non-tier, better drops that face fiercer competition.
---
-You mentioned wanting to dominate in PvP AND not rank in PvP. These two things seem to be at odds with one another unless your World PvP focus will involve only terrible or low level enemies.
---
-I don't understand this obsession people have with "over populated" classes. If you're a good mage in an ocean of mediocre ones that creates value regardless of how many other mages there are. The same goes for any class. No one is a unique snowflake, and having many mages around is not exactly a bad thing.
---
I have read your post twice, and my personal recommendation would be Mage:
---
You will be respeccing often. You said you understand the costs of that. I believe you understand the gold cost of that, but I wonder if you understand the time? A mage will farm you more gold faster than anything else. That means less time farming mobs and more time farming noobs.
---
Neat for those not in stress!
---
I hope this does not break rule #4, but this is an easy way to get your UI up and running before the game launches late August.
---
If you want to Bear tank, I highly recommend checking out Skarm's videos. He has tanked Naxx as both a warrior and a druid. Guy really knows his stuff.
---
Here's a link to his YouTube: https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ
---
Druids actually start off as slightly better tanks than warriors in 1.12, warriors only overtake them in BWL onwards.
---
Wheres mankirks wife
---
I'll make one if there's enough interest. I'd want there to be safeguards against misuse though.
---
I just wish they came up with a better argument than "it existed in vanilla" ya by WHY did it exist. There's tons of stuff they aren't bringing back.
---
Original talents in phase one plays completely differently. It changes every aspect of the game. Why aren't the same people fighting for those talents to come back? If "a true vanilla experience" is so important. We're getting a weird patched up remastered version of vanilla. Which is fine. Just come up with a better reason for certain things being excluded and others being included.
---
Same. I never once got bored in 2 years of vanilla, but TBC bored me within like a month and I permanently quit WoW after getting my epic flying mount. Classes feeling more powerful isn't everything, TBC just killed the overall feel of the game and made it very dull.
---
Since you're on the PvE server and don't really have to talk WPvP into account as much I'd say priest/druid/pally are all good choices. Paladins are very good but very tedious at 60, druids are amazing but require you to be very good with the class to really shine, and priests are just all around all-stars but there will most likely be a lot of them.
---
I agree completely. Classic/TBC Warrior tanking is so unique and challenging precisely because of the lack of AoE. And it's more fun for the rest of the group - it feels great to kite and solo an elite dungeon mob as a DPS, or perfectly manage your group's CC on a large pull.
---
The best part about this game is not level 60, from all my time playing throughout my youth the most memorable times have been from leveling up
---
I dont think you have it in you tbh. You just divert and mostly reflect on your emotional struggle that you experianced while reading my post. 
---
I think its an objective comparison of the subjective experiance a video game tends to be. Its impossible to reflect on both and not be guided by interpretations. However you can base your interpretations on the objective systems of the games. 
---
Whats objective about polish? Could you define this? Also quality of life is subjective? 
---
Maybe I base my life quality on the things I did that where difficult and challenging and not accesable and easy... So this is rather subjective aswell.
---
Don’t kink shame.
---
That's priest im going paly if only it were that easy!
---
No point. You benefit from grenadea and bombs in goblin, you get nothing after those initial crafts from gnomish, so you wouldn't do it. Unless you seriously must have a port to the gnomish target instead of goblin.
---
"free realm transfer"  and almost none will take it.
---
Rogues are definitely not shit. In PvP we're possibly the most unique and deadly class. Being able to pick your openings is huge. 
---
Our weakness is obviously having no cooldowns. Learn to use them sparingly. A good Rogue will one shot most classes from a position of advantage with all CD's up, which is tempting to do to everyone but you shouldn't all the time. EFC's, gank victims, people with annoying faces etc are all fair game though.
---
Play patiently, get first aid, take full advantage of poisons, avoid flairs and other anti-stealths, learn when to use blind and vanish. For every good Rogue there are 3 bad ones. Just don't be one of the 3 and you'll be fine.
---
OR, how about not designing raids to absolutely require a faction specific class.
---
I mean, it makes sense. I just have not experienced this back than. Maybe it's because everything was new and everyone was still discovering stuff, which resulted more in a "oh look, shiny item: congrats @player". Whereas now it's more about efficiency and because people can better estimate the value of an item.
---
Obviously being cautious of ninja looters is necessary, but it's sad that we always have to accomodate to the bad ones.  :/
---
Wheres your herniation? I got two in my thoracic. I can definitely bench heavy and light squat but the thought of deadlifting makes me cringe lol. I'm sure I could do it but the risk/reward just isnt there for me
---
Songflower buff is from felwood.  You need to collect cenarion salves in order to pick the songflower, which gives you crit and stats.  It only lasts for an hour but typically... you get Darkmoon Faire buff (when available), then dire maul tribute buffs, then port or hearth to winterspring, get songflower, then get summoned or portal to zg isle for zg heart buff, then stormwind for head buff... and now you are fully worldbuffed!
---
&gt;Anything in the ghetto of kalimdor.

---
About the only area there I didn't mind much was Tanaris, the rest of the continent, I just hated having to go to as Alliance.
---
Shamans should have stayed as a 2h class
---
Anyone can take a screenshot of client code.
---
cause none uses that, writting lock is not that much harder and anyone can understand that
---
It's about 10% of "Blizzlike" pservers. For example, starting zone humanoids on pservers can be pickpocketed for 10-40c each I think. But in the beta, it's closer to 1-4c. I tried higher level stuff, and it's about the same. Fairly weak results unless you get lucky lockboxes.
---
Against it. At least remove from lvl 20 and up, and in all pvp areas. Will not play classic if it isn't removed.
---
That's actually a really cool idea. I might announce on my server that everyone can mail me (I'll setup an email, or give people my Discord) with screenshots of historical events on the server.
---
(Really impressive raids on Stormwind that results in an epic battle, realm-firsts in anything, etc)
---
Would really help to glue together the community.
---
Yes it does. The frequency depends on the location. For example, if you're farming elementals or hanging out in STV or gankistan, LH in EPL, Sillithus.  It's hit and miss, but when it's peak hours and people are out for blood, you can expect to be taken off-task when you're farming to defend your cornhole. A lot of times it is multiple players versus you, and you're going to die and there won't be a damn thing you can do about it except leave the area. If you're not in the mood to deal with leaving an area, or even logging out to play an alt for 10-15 minutes while being camped, you are going to HATE LIFE. If not, then go PvP and it will be fine. But expect bullshit like if you're alliance trying to get a group to run RFD to be hassled and camped trying to get in and for the group to get frustrated and dissolve trying to get there 30 minutes or more into the endeavor. I kid you not, this WILL happen. Don't let people paint a pretty picture of PvP servers, because any PvP server with a healthy population means you're going to get griefed. Period.
---
Note: I'm going to roll on a PvP server.
---
I played a druid in Vanilla, I would often teleport to Moonglade to find a bed and log out there. Sure, it meant I had to use my HS when I logged back in, but that didn't matter to me.
---
If you'd enjoy both play-styles equally, and can stomach the slower leveling of a Warrior (although really Rogue aren't particularly fast either), then I would 100% say warrior especially if you're okay with tanking.
---
Bloodfury is BASE attackpower, so I assume that means it doesn't work on world buffs and similar?
---
unless you dig druid aesthetic and are ok with being more heavily hybrid taxed i'd go shaman. and also probably orc since the tauren hitbox is huge, and resisting stuns is hoog in pvp.
---
Spell cleave will compete for loot which one another.
---
This is true: MOST people. But there will be plenty that will grief you for the lulz. Be mentally prepared for that.
---
But if the number of people that want to play with a streamer is above the server cap it's still a problem on the said server...
---
Yeah the stun resist is so good. Warstomp, is so clutch though hard to not go with Tauren Shaman for me.
---
Impressive. You're really stuck in your own head
---
Agree. But everything else they fucked up, big time...
---
Maybe with a tighter server community in classic, we can get back to a more cooperative way of distributing loot even in pugs, I'll try my best convince others of it. How does the saying go? "Be the change you want to see." Anyways, good discussion.  :)
---
I was wondering if it can be ran through Wikipedia for each realm. I’m sure some people will be more active than others, but just having a designated person/group to write about their server would be pretty awesome.
---
You mistake viable and optimal. Every class is viable in vanilla.
---
I'll bite though. Tell me specs that were better defined and not just outright buffed to "feel better" on damage/healing meters.
---
You're right that there could still be queues... but I don't see how you get to the queues being longer. The two main things that make queues happen are
---
1) Everyone wanting to be on a specific server for some reason (like streamers, whether you like them or want to kill them)
---
2) There isn't enough space anywhere so you are stuck in a queue no matter where you go.
---
Number 1 will always be a problem, but layers definitely help with number 2. Blizzard could even cut off character creation when the number of unique accounts on a server hits their maximum concurrent player count. They couldn't do that in Vanilla because they needed to overfill servers to maintain populations long term but in Classic with layers if you already have 8x the population you need long term then cutting off character creation is fine.
---
I guess the point is ya, Layering doesn't completely solve all problems, but it does solve the main problem, and helps with a lot of little problems. At the very least, it doesn't make queues worse.
---
I remember feeling for the first time that I was no longer Blizzard's target audience when they nerfed cata dungeons. They were a blast at launch.
---
There are people paying for the lottery even in full confidence that they will not win it.
---
I love the fact that the pet is sad.
---
 Or being able to see low level "trivial" quests?    
---
i dont think this was in classic, added in like cata or something right?
---
Baby boomer on computer
---
Priest/Shaman give you the option to play either healer or DPS or hybrid, so if you feel like you'd enjoy that ability to mix things up I would recommend either of those (both are very strong so I'd go by play-style but you'll fight for gear less on Shaman).
---
There are gonna be a lot of mages, but honestly if you're okay with being pure damage then Mage/Warlock are both very good choices.
---
thats interesting, i thought it was added in tbc since people complained about being killed by those crazy new dynamic respawntimers and couldn't kill stuff fast enough
---
my bad, apologies
---
Yay! Witch hunting! The next step up from gearscore!
---
&gt; TBC is polarizing
---
this is what you aimed at by making this post
---
&gt; the consensus seems to be
---
you are trying to stir the pot with this. doesn't come off as you are sincerely interested in anyones opinion on the question in the last paragraph. or else, why even include it.
---
pfff I was working 40hr/week when I was legit addicted to this game. If I want to enjoy 40 hours of work, and 80 hours of WoW a week Im adult enough to know that its a bad idea and do it anyway.
---
Good post. Would a hunter with owl+ warrior be a decent combo? Screech and demo shout would be a huge debuff.
---
Yay pronounciation!  Also, "ebon" (ebb-un)  and "kris" (more like "crease")  Great video though!
---
Safeguard would be agreements made during dungeon and evidence of the accused breaking that agreement. That's all you need.
---
I am willing to bet that your average play time a day will go up with Classic. Leveling from 1-60 has a way of really sucking you into the game where you lose track of time.
---
Well sorry to say, but as someone who's been lifting heavily for 15 years, without a diet it's basically a waste of time. It doesn't need to be a crazy diet, but it needs to be some sort of diet. If you want to gain muscle, it's physically impossible without eating more than you're burning. Likewise for losing weight.
---
But for workouts - if you're talking calisthenics, (bodyweight), I'd just go with pullups/pushups/situps. Do close grip pushups to hit triceps, wide to hit chest, and regular as a fill in for both. Pullups do wide grip, hammer grip or underhand, and regular. Also make sure to toss in squats and lunges for legs. Preferably deadlift too
---
While doing these, I'd try to progress with handstands. Eventually being able to do handstand push-ups. Obviously that's wayyy advanced, so the above should be good for most people, although if they want a full workout they might need to add in some traps/shoulders isolated. 
---
For abs do planks and situps. I did calisthenics for maybe a solid year, and there's so much you can do, but a lot of it is very intense and has to be built up to. For example, pistol squats, hand stand pushups, rings, etc.
---
For ideal efficiency, you want to work each muscle twice a week. That means they may want to group something like this:
---
Monday - Pushups / Pullups
---
Tuesday - Legs / Abs
---
Wednesday - Off
---
Thursday - Pushups / Pullups
---
Friday - Off
---
Saturday - Legs / Abs
---
Sunday - Off
---
Legs should be a pretty intense workout. Body weight doesn't really hit legs hard, so you definitely want to give them some work. With body weight it's a bit different because each exercise hits so many muscles. This is why you can theoretically hit triceps, chest, back, biceps in one day fairly easily.
---
So just for example, let's say it's pushups/pullups: I'd do 3 sets of close grip pushups, 3 sets of wide, 3 sets of normal. 3 sets of wide pullups, 3 sets of hammer, 3 sets of normal or underhand. I'd also throw in some handstands or kickups (google) to build some strength.
---
 Once you get where you can easily do 20-30 of these, you can add little things to make them difficult. For pushups it's easy, you can elevate your feet. For handstand push-ups, you can do the pike pushup, which imo is very hard to do correctly form wise. You basically want to have dead legs and lean on your arms completely.
---
Pullups there's not much you can do besides doing weighted, but be careful. I pulled a muscle bad years ago doing 100 LB added pullups, so I've never gone heavy on them again. It was fucked up for a solid 6 months. I don't want to make this too long so I'll keep it here
---
It's doable if you PUG literally every week, and invite druid tanks, or tanks that already have it. You just need to advertise with "bindings reserved" to avoid any drama.
---
He was in the trifecta, Skyfang, Drama, and DnT :).
---
I’ll just macro a contractural agreement macro and spam it at the beginning of every run!
---
Killing multiple mobs at a time or in chain is where you get that speed. With a mage is easy because of their wonderful cc aoe. With a warlock if you want to boost speed you must chain pull and continually use your ressources (don't do single target kills).
---
Why should he screw himself over like that? Once put on, it is worth maybe 10g instead of a 20% chance of 500g or whatever. Most people are not stupid assholes, you just have to give them the chance to show it to you. 
---
You know, you have to put a little trust in people, there are no guarantees in vanilla wow and sometimes, a little trust and faith in other people is required.
---
This is not Eve where everyone is trying to fuck you over and it isn't retail where you'll never see each other again.
---
For some (I hope many) the community in vanilla wow was an important factor for the enjoyment of the game, if it turns into a toxic every man for himself, fuck you if you waste even 20s of my time environment, I'm out.
---
Do it up man.  If you want any criticism or help, feel free to inbox me.
---
Ps. I'm not really vain in how I look, but I hold a certain weight for strength goals and i, by no means, look like a big slug like some Strongmen tend to look like. lol
---
Most high ranks from vanilla were just good at grinding and when arena hit a lot of ppl realized they werent that good at pvp afterall.
---
I tried arena with a bunch of friends in TBC but where battlegrounds can make any class and spec sorta work, arena was merciless and many specs or classes were simply not viable if you wanted to win a lot.
---
Fair enough. You should get a cat!
---
I'm actually not sure whether you can buy the mounts without exalted. Those exmaples you saw may very well refer to the main race of the mount, who can buy and use the mounts without being exalted.
---
But in the end it's a moot point, you need exalted for the riding skill and even if you could buy the mounts before that, all you get is a full inventory slot for 900g.
---
Wool cloth is also not correct, you can do the wool turn in exactly once. The only repeatable quest is the runecloth donation and you can expect to donate 4000-6000 runecloth (or 200-300 stacks) to reach exalted. Plus, I think the cloth quest is only added in phase 3.
---
"Ah, but technically we were inside the dungeon when we made the agreement, so I'm not a ninja"
---
You can't "lock" a player to a layer because layers are dynamic.  If there's only 400 people online at 1am, there will only be one layer.  Otherwise you'd have layers with no one on them, which would be way worse for things like farming Black Lotus or chests.  And if you're stuck on that layer with your cooldown to switch not up?  Well, sucks to be you if you wanted to run a dungeon or group for an elite quest.
---
No, what doesn't make sense is pretending like every country had the same ISPs than yours. A good internet connection was very common in Nordic countries at the time already.
---
&gt;More importantly as I've already said, even if you did that would still leave you having to explain away shit like AQ being a total shitshow.
---
What? That was because of Blizzards servers couldn't handle that many players in the same area. Kind of obvious...
---
no I have doggies
---
are there pros to playing a female tauren vs male?  like smaller hit box or anything
---
Yeah there is some caster mail. Deep Earth shoulders for example will always go to shamans who want to play ele pvp. You'll get T1/T2 pieces for healing but some of these pieces/set bonus are also very good for ele pvp. You won't have prio on caster trinkets but you can still get your class trinket in BWL + ZG trinket and you're good to go.
---
The people who are completely hysteric and instist that layering will completely ruin classic are starting to annoy me more than the people who pretents layering has no problems
---
Sounds like you’ve found the absolutely worst players to watch on stream though. The good streamers most definitely know what they are doing. 
---
Imo you don’t really need a dedicated tank for trash pre-40 since aggro will bounce between melee who crit anyway. WF totem is a real killer at 32 (?).
---
What kind of fantasy are you living in? Ashenvale is like 95% Horde dominated zone.
---
Thanks, but I wasn't going to list every exercise possible, I could probably write a dictionary sized book on workout exercises lol. And by the way - 3 times a week has been shown to be basically as effective as 2, where as the difference between 1 and 2 is major. 2 is the sweet spot for people who aren't gym freaks and just want to be "fit".
---
You can verify what they choose prior to it. If a flask recipe or similar drops you really want to consider rolling need as well.
---
The only verification I need is the verification of identity of the person who is accusing the ninja looter, and I only care if that accuser is an officer of a raiding guild on my server. Officers of (most) raiding guilds get instant credibility for their accusations; anything else is a small-potatoes issue I don't care about anyway.
---
Of course raiding guild officers already know how to spread the word about ninja looters, rage-wipers, etc... among the server community.
---
I am not pretending anything. Point out where I did?
---
&gt;What? That was because of Blizzards servers couldn't handle that many players in the same area. Kind of obvious...
---
Yeah almost like the servers couldn't handle better batching. Kind of obvious.
---
#nochangesexceptwhatithinkshouldbechanged
---
What item was it? 8000g sounds insane unless youre not talking about vanilla.
---
Eh put the burden on the twats downvoting everyone that says it wont be removed. Then again they are all probably not goin to stick around long enough to matter anyway.
---
You will rue the day!
---
1. level 40 duels don't matter
---
2. saying that this didn't help melee classes, because warriors still lose 1v1s to mages is completely ridiculous. 
---
3. there will be a ton of situations, where melees would win when they would have lost in vanilla
---
Why can’t everyone change their diet right away? That’s generally the first step in any personal transformation.
---
Change diet first and basic resistance exercise second. So given that Classic is ~6 weeks away, people should have plenty of time to start eating right, then pick a few body resistance exercises they can do during gryphon/manticore flights and they’re set.
---
In fact greasing the grove with pull-ups would be perfect for WoW Classic. Buy a cheap chin-up bar and put it close to your PC and every hour or so try and work your way up to 5 reps.
---
Hammer of Bestial Fury is better
---
in your opinion
---
I had wish washy friends that started alliance when I was horde, I switched and they quit and I kept going, then they went back Horde and I didn’t. Weird at first...very weird. Now I can’t stand horde vibe.
---
That's exactly why he doesn't deserve any respect.
---
No, not really lol I'm up at 6 anyway for work and it's pretty much shower, coffee, and go
---
hope they disallow transfers for a time at least
---
I hate that place. I skip it every time. I grind some mobs when I’m done Barrens up to like 24 then head straight to Ashenvale and Thousand Needles.
---
Don't under estimate the pain of leveling a warrior, especially if you are on a PvP server. Getting destroyed by nearly every class from levels 20-40 (give or take) can be very frustrating and causes a lot of warriors to burn out. Rolling on a PvE server would remove some of that frustration, I suppose, but also some of the excitement. If you roll warrior I would plan on tanking more often than not.
---
The only answer is that you are playing Warlock incorrectly.
---
GL defining what is need and what is greed when a flask of titans drops.
---
I don't think so. Wrath was the beginning of "bring the player, not the class" with a lot of overlapping buffs and CCs, like hex/bloodlust and polymorph/time warp.
---
Why dont u go test it before you make this even more embarrasing.
---
No, the two are exactly the same.
---
What? Undercity is nowhere near as good looking as Orgrimmar. Orgrimmar is the sickest Horde city by far and is better looking than Darnassus at least.
---
Once warlocks figured out seed of corruption it was all over. I think we brought one mage for tanking illidari council (needed the spellsteal), and maybe 1 other because he was good. Once we had t6 on farm, my guild let me bring my alt warlock just so clearing trash on hyjal could go faster. 5-6 warlocks and a prot pally tank made for very fast hyjal clears.
---
Whichever is lower pop and faster BG queues
---
1 arms seems fine for the 4% dmg debuff for sure. Slam build or deep arms?
---
&gt; or significantly less of an expense for them.
---
Hunters are not bad, Druids are okay as long as you are comfortable with your primary role being versatility, but Rogue kinda sounds like the class that will keep you engaged.
---
Becouse private servers dont have leeway...
---
Yup I LOVE summer, so this is the first time ever I'm wanting it to go by quickly. Probably not the healthiest mindset. I do continue to play on a pserver because of the boredom factor, and also to keep my skills/knowledge sharp. If I don't play a game for a long time I tend to forget things. Also, there is zero chance of burnout.
---
No you don't know that, didn't happen on retail Vanilla, didn't happen on the biggest private server.
---
population only went up.
---
Nice, i was hoping for Something Like this!! Thanks a Lot!
---
more players on the realm is the reason
---
a realm with 2k players is dead compared to a realm with 15k players, people are willing to wait in a longer queue to get on the realm that has more players including all their friends. 
---
and the people most likely to pick the realms with least players because of a queue are the tourists who just want to check it out, so when it comes time for like 80% of the population to quit, it will be skewed to most of the low pop realms quitting while all the long time players stuck it out in queues to be on popular realms.
---
I started replaying the series from warcraft 1
---
Yeah ability and spec design peaked in WotLK, but Blizzard's PvP balancing (or lack thereof) was atrocious. They were incredibly slow to react, and when they did the changes they decided on were baffling to all PvPers. Changes targeted at PvE would break entire arena seasons. I moved on to MOBAs shortly afterwards, and the responsiveness and involvement of those devs was such a breath of fresh air. 
---
Broken cleave comps, Shadowmourne and other PvE gear being auto-win, dual healer, etc. So much anti-fun.
---
It’s completely different on pservers that’s why
---
I'm not against layering, I'm against phasing; the in-game layer change.
---
Almost all the problems and abuses come from the player phasing.
---
My solution to remove player phasing while keeping layers would be to let the player choose a layer in the character screen after clicking the "Enter World" button. A window pop-up would appear and show the non-full layers. Of course, we still need an incremental cooldown timer if a character wants to switch layer to prevent layer hop abuses. It is not a perfect solution and would require some refining, but I think it is still definitely better than in-game player phasing.
---
No more death caused by a random layer change.
---
CB Prep is pretty OP, otherwise enjoy not having MoD, imp sap...and long CDs, and no CoS! You better be damn good
---
lost me at Hee
---
but then again im a little slow eh
---
The only reason it is a required tool is because of threat drop mechanics in fights. It is by no means an inherently required mechanic. Other things could change first to make room for classes that work around different mechanics.
---
Paladins would be fine tanks for plenty of encounters but their bigger issue is that they have pretty much non existent gear progression. Few offset tank items, and no spell dmg plate.
---
Because that justifies everything...  Hey I am going to shoot you in th head.  It's not murder, because I announced it.
---
It is a select set of loud people who think releasing a bunch of vanilla servers is a good idea. There needs to be a solution that uses technology to solve the issue. The big complaint that people had was zone continuity and players and NPC's disapearing when going from one zone to another. So they took the complaints that were real complaints and not OMG sharding was not in vanilla........From there they developed a solution that would be less immersion breaking and more like standard servers.....Also where does the evidence support they will not hit 30..... many of the tourists play through until they hit max level and are done, some will join for raids. There different types of tourists and layering covers the majority of them and the slow trickle of wow player that will leave.
---
Hell look at your name follow the evidence, video games are full of tourists today and sharding breaks continuity. Layering does the best job to maintain continuity.
---
Same boat as you, as basic as it may be Im leaning human for lore, also my first paladin was male draenai and I always hated how goofy mine looked in tier sets next to humans and I fear the same thing will happen if I go dwarf, also fear my sweetass 2handers will constantly be clipping into the dirt.
---
 As far as min/maxing racials they are both sweet choices. I will miss stoneform, the dance, taunt, possible mechano strider, and the just straight up awesomeness of dwarves.
---
Plenty of glad warlocks were UA spec.
---
Hi self, are you me? I totally dont have 20+ characters over 100. No sir.
---
Ah this allows me to configure addons and keybindings? Great
---
I don't know who the good ones are tbh, but I'd like some links to people who do this so I can analyze and expand :)
---
The "tank" in my group also first comes into play from level 40 onwards? Is really only there for the few hard trash mobs and very few hard hitting bosses that needs a dedicated tank. If you're horde I also recommend having a shaman? Dunno if this was critique.
---
Are CDs up?  Yes - OP af. No - free honor kill.
---
First off, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you use a macro. But when do u use it? I bet it's not when you first get in the group. I bet it's after everyone has spent considerable time to get in the dungeon. If you had told them beforehand, they likely would have just booted you. Either way, you are effectively holding them hostage after you get to the instance.
---
Secondly, what right do you have to dictate loot rules for everyone else? None. But they have to go by your rules, because you need everything.
---
Third, a lot of people will just roll greed, regardless of your new rules. You see they're so used to not being a dick that it becomes a force of habit. These have been the standard rules forever after all. That means you are getting an unfair distribution of loot. You are ninja'ing loot.
---
The trick is to get everyone to agree to the rules before anything has dropped :)
---
But yeah, that might still be a difficult situation when it actually drops ... I'll see how it turns out.
---
I think in most guilds one of their core members they know are going to be around for the long haul usually already has the MT spot reserved.
---
 Summon people
---
I play games like CSGO where the time I invest in it doesn't seem like it will be wasted if leave it for a long time to play classic.
---
Against it. Layering ruins the wow vanilla experience for me. I would accept layering ONLY in starting zones (durotar, mulgore, elwynn forest, dun morogh, teldrassil, tirisfal glades). But layering through whole phase 1!? Give me a fucking break.
---
**Female Night Elf** (hunter/rogue) or **Female Orc** (hunter/rogue) \*Leaning Rogue\*
---
Night elf option pros:
---
1. Favorite race, lore, culture, asthetics, appearance and customization options, animations, *everything*. (big factor)
---
2. Shadowmeld is nice for hunter. (small factor)
---
3. Love Teldrassil, Darkshore and Ashenvale. (small factor)
---
Night elf option cons:
---
1. Played Horde 90% of my WoW time, so I don't really like the rest of Alliance's races and cities - playing with humans, gnomes and dwarves feels alien so far. (big factor)
---
2. Shadowmeld is quite bad for rogue. (small factor)
---
3. Horde have on average better racials for PvP so it might be harder especially vs orcs. (small factor)
---
Orc option pros:
---
1. I am Horde, I am home. The zones and cities are known and close to me, and I have my brethren races beside me. (big factor)
---
2. Orc racials are great for both classes. (small-medium factor)
---
Orc option cons:
---
1. Female Orc is not a close second choice, as aesthetics, customization options, animations all feel underwhelming compared to a female NE. Only reason I prefer Femorc to the rest of the Horde races are racials + the fact that I find undead, trolls and taurens even worse appearance wise. (big factor)
---
I tried to make a list with priorities, but even then I still feel like approaching it from a logical/mathematical perspective will not suffice.
---
Basically, I love NE and I love Horde. I'm currently playing both options on a pserver in order to see which way I tilt, but basically whenever I play NE I miss being Horde, and whenever I play Orc I can't help but crave to play the race which I actually enjoy looking at. *Help me?*
---
Anyone who's done the switch from Horde to Ally or the other way around, did you experience something similar? Did it pass or did you revert back to your original faction? What would your choice be in my situation? 
---
Please leave a comment even if it's something minor, I'll appreciate anything!
---
Plus gnome's dying scream is so funny
---
In response to #2 it's more like all melee lose to all ranged consistently, hardly just that mages beat warriors. And level 40 duels are all we have to compare to right now, but yea I agree that warriors will get better at 60 and it could push them over a line.
---
This leeway existed in Vanilla though, I had good internet back then and it was comical how far I could smack things as a Tauren Shaman. It may not have been *quite* as far as the current extreme examples that people are posting, but if it does get tweaked it's not going to be by a huge amount.
---
We used to do something like this when we played vanilla.
---
\- When your toon eats/drinks for a food buff, drink 1 glass of water.  Ensure you stay hydrated with something other than caffeine.  Most of the time you do this every 15 to 30 minutes so not bad, if you stay constant.
---
\- if you get a green upgrade you do 5 pushups, 5 sit ups, 5 burpies, 5 squats.  purple upgrade increases it to 10 per.  This makes dungeon runs your "workout time"
---
\- when you ding, you have to go outside as soon as possible and walk for 10 minutes around the block.
---
\- dying (not in dungeon or raid) you have to time how long it takes you to get back to your body and then you owe yourself the exact same amount of time doing a plank.   Made deaths in some zones killer.
---
\- we had others for when you killed someone in PvP, flight paths, completing a dungeon but I can't recall them specifically.   
---
Sure none of these were going to get you in shape, but the helped you stay active during those 5+ hour gaming sessions.
---
Because there is a line that when crossed makes it not that worth while to even bother to AH an item.
---
I think that a lot of people is on the same situation as you. Most of us who played back then, we dont have the same free time than 15 years ago. Anyway, Im gonna play when I can and im sure that Im gonna enjoy the experience. The only thing that piss me off is the release date. C'mon Bli$$ard, you couldn't release It a few weeks before since is when most of the people has holidays?
---
For the reasons you listed against warrior, warlock sounds like the obvious choice. Fun leveling experience, not melee, and overall a very strong pvp class.
---
Here's my thoughts. Alliance has gnomes. You have to be horde to kill gnomes. You should roll horde.
---
He's clearly trolling man. Just leave him be.
---
The launcher can and had gotten people banned as it can be used to modify assets
---
I know that I am going to roll a Tauren Druid. Simply can't decide if it will be a be a male or female cow. Very important and difficult decision, please send help.
---
good man
---
Let me guess. A flask of the titans recipe should just go to the alchemists?
---
I feel none of the warrior specs got better, but then again they were already pretty good. More or less the same.
---
For a single mob, how do you take down a mob as a warlock?
---
And what makes you think people will take the "offer"? No one wanted to leave big servers in vanilla either.
---
I recall many tough zones while leveling my mage in vanilla, but the one that stands out in my memory as particularly distasteful is Swamp of Sorrows. I have no positive memories of that place. Felwood is a close 2nd because of the difficulty of the mobs and the tough travel.
---
That's an entirely different purpose though. You should obviously not start the real client with this.
---
You've sold me with those add-ons. I've been couch gaming lately and wanted to play some version of WoW. This is a good idea until Classic hits.
---
Do they activate from your bags or how does that work?
---
[Here's a video in glorious 240p showing the basic process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsx2Zc79aR8)  
---
The Treants with flowers cast heals on the barren ones, which complicates things. Easiest way I found to deal with them was throwing on Curse of Doom, then using first Rank 1 then Rank 2 Banish. Total time of the two ranks is 50 seconds, so it's fairly easy to effectively keep them out of combat except to take that giant damage spike from Doom. Easy enough to kill once the melee Treants are dead.
---
Mm, wait until the warriors get to 60 and get a little gear.
---
No I'm not lol.
---
I work 9 to 5 and still play at least 3hr of gaming a day and I swear some days im FUCKING BORED.
---
Imagine having 24 hrs to do only things I WANT to do and not have any obligation. I would get totally mad.
---
Playing games after 8 hr work feels so fucking good and rewarding.
---
For whatever reason, this map reminds me of the Redwall series. It's been a loooong time, so maybe the maps were similar... There were maps, right? I'm not crazy/making things up?
---
I agree that spell batching is off compared to private servers, and i dont have enough info on what is wrong. Im not sure about the exact Numbers, but you can replicate what perplexity did in his video, on private servers (except tauren hitbox)
---
I fully agree that leeway is not as big of an issue as people make it out to be, but using three dueling tournaments at level 30 and 40, where casters are FAR stronger than anything else, is just not a good argument.
---
Super helpful and insightful, I didn't expect to learn anything today. Thank you
---
&gt; In my dungeons, users will be able to need on anything they can use as long as it's an upgrade AND they use it. If they don't, well, I'm making sure their name is forever known as the guy who ninja'd X item 
---
I pray I'm never in one of your groups. 
---
Mage rolls need on Emberstone staff a level before they can equip it? Ninja
---
Warrior needs on a sword, but doesn't use it because their skill is low and it would lower their dps? Ninja
---
Yeah but private servers are run by volunteers. Not companies. There's nothing at stake for them if one of them has a bad day / emotionally unstable week and pulls the plug. And blizzard is definitely going to be more adamant about shutdowns when they actually are losing money to private servers when they launch classic
---
You don't have to agree to that "rule". But if everybody accepts this rule, except for you and you roll need when it drops, then:
---
&gt; News flash:
---
you are the ninja in the group.
---
I am just stating how I feel about it, you can agree or not. And I am not scamming anybody if they agree on not rolling on the recipe. You see; In a game where the community matters and where people can build up a reputation, it might also be rather helpful to leave someone the recipe: chances are you can get the flask at cost (meaning: without the hefty premium because the recipe is so rare).
---
Anyways, to each their own ... I prefer cooperation and having a relationship with other cooperative players.
---
Uh, mining
---
Because you don't have an argument, just buzzwords.
---
WoW, even with layering, is persistent. When you level up to twenty, you're still twenty when you next log in. When you finish all the quests at Grom'Gol, you can't do those quests again on that character. When your warrior gets that Whirlwind Axe, when you next log in, you still have that axe.
---
Now, will it be possible to enter different instances of the same persistent world? Yes. But what that actually changes is relatively minimal compared to what actually remains persistent. The players you were ganking/being ganked by, resource nodes, and living/dead NPCs (Which as the latter two respawn anyway, you can argue aren't 'persistent' anyway.)
---
If that's enough to get your panties in a wad, don't play.
---
Some people would like to play feral without farming pummelers. It is possible, but I always recommend not to choose feral then or maybe concentrating more on tanking because then you will be using alot less pummeler charges, mostly for just initial TPS burst. Druid was meant to be hybrid and now that we know of the cheesy stuff that enables us to play dps and tanking roles as well, there is a cost. In my opinion it is obvious that you have to do some extra work to play something unique like that. I have run about 1500 Gnomeregan runs in 1 year and I am not bored to it, but that's just me :) You can do the gnomeregan runs without it taking too much of your time if you just plan it well. I usually do 1 set of 5 runs before i log out, and when i log in or sometimes when I just have nothing better to do and this is enough to give me all pummelers for each week easily.
---
I'll be leveling my mage with friends, and we need mage for our comp, so that's why. I'm looking for something else that still fits the criteria.
---
Well, then I just disagree. If the whole party is fine with people rolling need on BoEs, then its no ninja'ing imo. If all agree to roll greed, and one guy all of a sudden need, that's for me ninja'ing.
---
&gt; Making up your own rules is just adding another step to ninja'ing shit.
---
Or to avoid ninja looting if everyone agrees beforehand.
---
I always thought it gave me more rested xp haha
---
Assume what you want.
---
You need exalted with the bg reput, it’s not difficult once Alterac is out but yeah there must be guides to do it as fast as possible
---
Male is cuter but also bigger so this is what it comes to
---
Do you mind giving a brief synopsis of why they are terrible?
---
What would you consider to be good enough proof to put someone on the list? Two shitty screenshots of party chat before the dungeon and after the ninja loot?
---
Even if you were to stream the entire dungeon, it could still be exploited to fuck over individuals you don't like.
---
It's just too easily exploitable to be taken seriously if you allow it as a public thing.
---
You do understand that I was exaggerating to make a point, right?
---
I think arms is a better choice. There may be slightly less dmg but what you lose there you gain in utility with arms. Arms feels more consistent imo. Tactical mastery is amazing. Also the /sit macro to proc enrage wont work on classic, and many people leveling fury on private  servers would do this.
---
A geared 60 warrior was thing king of PvP... just wait lol
---
So venruki, cdew, and who won the last one
---
Been planning to main a hunter and alt roll a mage but have been tinkering around in WSG on an i60 server and I'm finding that I'm just atrociously bad with mage I guess.  I'm dead way before I can ever have a meaningful impact on anything so I've all but written that job off.  I'm enjoying hunter pvp but find myself mostly wanting to log into me elemental shaman where I enjoy being able to do some bursty damage but also really enjoy falling back to help heal (where I find myself wishing I had better healing tools available, but still enjoy the option to do both) and Warlock which is surprisingly tanky feeling for a cloth wearer and I enjoy dotting a bunch of people and being able to life tap, use healthstone, etc and can really see where to improve my play on this class.  At this point I'm debating if I shouldn't switch my main to one of these two classes or perhaps even consider giving priest a try to see if it's a better alternative to shaman for a dps/heal mix. 
---
Any thoughts on hunter v shaman v warlock v priest main from the pve or wpvp side which I'm not getting to see?  How will gold farming be for these classes?  I'm guessing warlock should be on par with hunter for single target farming but probably not instance wise, especially as it sounds like instance farming is already going to be a little worse than the pserver scene has hyped it up to be.
---
I’d bet layering in phase 2 but I am guessing just as anyone else.
---
I've seen absolutes in both camps; pro-layering saying "the game will be LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE without layering" and also #nochanges saying "I'd rather NOT PLAY AT ALL". Both are ridiculous.
---
But I don't think this subreddit's community is any worse than other communities. I've seen lot of people arguing reasonably and I agree with you that we must keep everything civil if we want to keep the discussion going.
---
Making a statement like this based off of a lvl 40 duel tournament seems like a bit of a stretch. Dueling is completely separate from any other kind of pvp and lvl 40 vs lvl 60 isn't even in the same ballpark in terms of gameplay/class balance/available tools.
---
Habit. Mental roadblocks. Availability. 
---
Lots of people binge eat due to depression or other reasons. These people will fall off the wagon quickly if they jump straight in. 
---
A lot of people eat what's available or what they can afford. In America, junk is more readily available and healthy alternatives can be more expensive depending on your area.
---
Fitness and diet are most effective when taking small steps to avoid burnout.
---
They'll still lose the tournament.
---
Snutz (warlock)
---
Yeah. I started to ramp up my playing on private servers to test out professions, see which one I want to level with. 
---
I had mining/engineering at 285. Lot of fun, got rich selling bars/stone. 
---
Then I got leatherworking/skinning up to almost 300. Not bad, but idk. Leatherworking seemed like it would be very interesting but in the end it didn't grab me. Wanted to go Tribal but not enough wildvines for that attunement crafting quest. Went with Elemental just for the 2 recipes you get taught from vendor. Made those, and unlearned both. 
---
Recently picked up herb/alchemy. At 270. Seems fun enough. As a druid I can cheetah form for quick node to node travel, and I can actually pick flowers while in cheetah form, saving time. Same for skinning, don't have to shapeshift to gather, unlike mining. 
---
It's been good to get a taste for what path I want to take. 
---
Engineering was fun, I love the trinkets. Went Gnomish, built everything they had. I might scrap herb/alchemy and learn goblin this time. That way I have all the gnomish stuff to use but being goblin I can remake the consumable explosives like sapper charge, etc. But that goblin rocket fuel seems like a bottleneck. If too many things rely on that then no, don't want to get stuck waiting on volatile rum drops then having to find an alchemist to make it for me. 
---
I think my experience will be vastly different on a fresh server. An established/inflated economy skews the AH a lot. I found leatherworking to not be the money maker I thought it would be. It was actually better money wise to pick mining back up and just sell ore/stone and buy the leather outright off the AH. 
---
I've heard that is what happens on fresh servers, that leather floods the AH and it's actually kinda cheap to just buy what you need for Leatherworking. 
---
At least with Herb things like Swiftthistle and Fadeleaf sell very well since Rogues use them throughout the entire game. Should always have a market. 
---
Plus Alchemy is consumables, so your customers come back for more. Trouble is the recipes I really enjoyed are world drops. Lot of them were on the AH for purchase at decent costs. Fresh server, not so sure.
---
They'll still lose the tournament

 "count up from classic"
---
I played vanilla to MOP as alliance and just tried horde in vanilla private server and holy crap is leveling 1-40 easier as a horde. You get some insane zones like barrens that you never need to leave 10-22+ whereas alliance have to hop back and forth 2-3 zones during the same span. Also can we talk about how ridiculous the zeppelins are in terms of world travel? That time saved levels 25-45 is really a huge benefit that alliance don’t get. I would argue that levels 48-60 slightly benefit alliance with ironforge’s proximity to blackrock mountain (searing gorge and burning steppes) and how much time you’ll spend there during those levels and end game.
---
Well we are talking hypotheticals and Ive already stated I dont think that anyone should be forced to, I think it should be done on an opt-in basis lol but to answer your question it would be a seniority thing where one person has been paying and playing longer. Same as when private servers did it they based it on seniority. The amount of time invested in a character outweighs pure money spent. I.e. if someone just reserved a named and never plays the character and it sits as a level 1 bank alt versus someone at level cap playing nightly with a big reputation built up on the server. Of course this is assuming no layering so that reputation actually matters of course so that brings us back to point 1 bahaha
---
There is no better argument? That is the whole point of this project. To recreate vanilla. Not modify it. This is what the vocal populous of this subreddit wanted, and now we are getting it. You can come up with moot points like they aren't progressing the server in exact fashion, but this is a core mechanic, as opposed to using the final balance patch as a base for talents.
---
Send voidwalker, apply curse of agony, apply corruption, attack with wand until death. That’s if they are within a level or two of me.
---
You'll need to copy your interface and wtf folders to /\_classic\_ as that will be the path for the live version
---
You can easily farm the demons (57-61 elites) in Northeastern Winterspring with enslave demon, they have a chance to drop the anathama/benediction material "The Eye of Shadow" which can sell for a pretty penny, drop a lot of other BoEs, and also have a chance to drop Felcloth. There is also a vendor in the same area that sells felcloth which is nice for the felcloth but also the ability to sell shit easily. The enslaved demons are also usesful against the bears in the area if you just want to farm normal mobs, they have good trash drops that sell ok. The demons can also be used against the frost giants in the area that drop the material needed for the melee juju, which sells well too.
---
Melee doesn't mean all warrior. Could have rogues.

---
np man we good, i dont use reddit 2 often, so i have 0 clue about like tryhard formatting etc :D
---
There's a difference between what anti-layering people (sane people) want in terms of queues (vanilla queues) and what will happen here. Of course this was too difficult for you to figure out, even though it's obvious it is not the same thing at all.
---
In vanilla, servers had a cap of how many people were allowed to make characters on there. If the server was "full", no new characters could be made there except by players who already had characters on there. This made the queues short.
---
Now if in Classic a server has 9000 players and that is divided into 3 layers, each of 3000 players - what do you think that means when layering is ended by phase 2, like Blizzard said? Queues of possibly 6000 people unable to EVER log in.
---
You thought you sounded smart in your defense of layering, retail kiddie, but you kinda just embarrassed yourself after all. There are no benefits to layering.
---
Awesome. This is good to hear. I’ve just heard gear is hard to come by in vanilla so I can’t imagine trying to get twice as much.
---
Charge ? ? And he literally said duo level with a shaman - which has ES
---
Funny how you dodged the part where I stated you can’t know who is an alchemist and who isn’t.
---
You are not just stating how you feel. You are trying to brand people you disagree with as “ninjas”.
---
Not to speak for him, but I think he said earlier that he still wants to run the show after launch. I asked him about a potential BC podcast in 2-3 years, and he said that’s probably not the scope he wants for the show, and that he’ll probably have moved on by then.
---
You should edit your comment then because the "examples" you gave favor dynamic respawns to layering. I'll also go out on a limb and say you didnt level to 60 on that other server which had dynamic respawns. I have first hand experience, and I keep seeing people who dont giving out suggestions...
---
It's been many years since I've leveled, but the quests seemed good. Literally load up with Nesingwary and go kill everything that movies. I'm a simple man, and I like simple quests.
---
Of course, that's how you bait the trap I suppose. That's why Nesingary is there. He's the warning sign that it's a trap and you will be hunted.
---
Which is retarded and is an issue caused by layering. You never had to wait long in a queue in vanilla because the servers populations were not completely assfucked by a dumb idea like layering.
---
You need therapy if you're this concerned over such a small facet of the game community, holy cow.
---
Seriously, you need help.
---
and delete the [config.wtf](https://config.wtf) afterwards. Let the real classic client generate a new one when it goes live.
---
If there's 5 layers, there's 5 times the max population, so there's probably a 60 rogue on every layer doing the same thing
---
??? Blizzard has not indicated at all that the layers will be static and the beta is all we have to go off of, and with ~month to release I can't imagine they have too many more reworks in mind.  I mean, obviously we can't be sure but right now 100% of the evidence points to non-static layers.
---
Feralas. I hated that zone and always will. Green, too much green!!!! That said I played Horde back in the days and the Feralas experience might be better on the Alliance side.
---
I raided in Return for MC  &amp; BWL and the guild master Sly actually showed me his "BiS raiding comp" that he would like to get and it includes one feral. He also said he wanted me to be that feral, but I will be playing with my original vanilla guild Blood Pressure. Return officers told me that biggest problem with ferals is that it is VERY difficult to find a competitive feral that actually puts the time and effort to it and plays it really well, as it is not the easiest spec to play well. And why it is difficult to find those is because it is quite unpopular as well. There surely are loads of people who could do it on a very competitive level, but just don't have the guts to do or aren't let to do it yet. I believe Classic will introduce more people playing feral and I'm very interested to see how other people fare with it.
---
Layering will be gone before BWL is released.
---
Ok. So I don't agree to your rules made during the dungeon and therefor I am not a ninja looter..
---
Arcane with 2 set T5 and spriest+innervate was warlock level DPS, but you could only really have one. Bit much setup, but it was certainly possible.
---
This is overwhelming, I also what to make sure I have my shit in order upon log in. Last thing I want to do is be an hour or two behind everyone else for no reason.
---
It is still absurdly stupid of Blizzard to assume that vast majority of players are quitting before phase 2. It wasn't like that and it won't be like that now. Just look at any vanilla priva, they can have an active playerbase of like 12 000 players for 2-3 years.
---
Blizzard is going to have a clusterfuck on their hands of promising to end layering within a month, but still having 12 000 players on many servers, and only 3000 of them can be online at a time.
---
Blizzard is fucking stupid, essentially.
---
Class quest at 10, I don't think you'll be able to pick it up in Bloodhoof. It's always more time consuming doing this, but I understand why youd want to. Mulgore is far more entertaining than durotar imo. And more aesthetically pleasing. 
---
Other than the class quest you're not missing out on much else I dont think.
---
How on earth do you know that Blizzard isn't putting limits on realm size? Just because there are layers doesn't mean they can't put an artificial cap on it.
---
Hahaha yeah I’ve done way too much research, to the point where I know too much for my own good. Every time I settle on one class I end up thinking the other is superior. 
---
I think this is what I’m going to do:
---
Main warrior, try to keep up w the priest. The warrior will definitely be dungeon heavy which I enjoy. If I’m ever getting ganked or corpse camped into oblivion than I’ll hop on my rogue and level at my own pace, have a more quest oriented leveling experience avoiding any of the drawbacks from wpvp. Sounds like a plan to me.
---
roll greed
---
...most aren't. I mean. 9 to 5 is like your basic day workers shift lol
---
Is this not common where you are because it sounds out of touch for me.
---
Debatable, Warriors are extremely gear dependent and Druid tanks dont get the majority of their BiS till AQ40. 
---
Druids are amazing 5 man tanks, and make the best off tanks. Fights in raids can require upwards of 5+ tanks, how awesome is it when one of you off tanks can do that, then shift out rez someone, innervate a main healer, throw some off heals or hell even DPS (a druid tanks gear is better for DPS than a Fury warrior in prot gear).
---
I’m in the same boat, I buy a game with all intentions to finish it but I either open it once or twice or not at all and spend my time just watching YouTube.
---
Another question: is the hitbox the same while shapeshifted as a druid?
---
Inconsistent play times in uncommitted amounts.   Hour or two here and there. 
---
Would raid almost never.
---
Casual BGs would be my main attraction, primarily WSG.  
---
Like 5 mans as well, getting tier .5 at some point will be a goal. 
---
Was thinking priest or Druid would fit the bill, but I’m open to all classes.
---
WoW Classic:  The Safe Space!
---
omg yessssss. getting ganked / camped as a warrior was the worst. literally no escape and insane mail/plate bills.
---
That has nothing to do with what this guy was saying. Every single person playing on the streamer server are people who want to play with the streamers. Come on, you are allowed to use your head. Pretending to be stupid does not win arguments for you.
---
5x5 put me on the map, made me love strength training. With heavy lifting and portion control (read calorie counting) I went from a 313 pound guy who could barely bench 135, to a 235 pound guy benching 345 for reps, squatting 495 and deadlifting 595 in the space of 3 years.
---
I've since moved on from 5x5 for more advanced workouts, but it's a great program to get started with, and really easy to follow. Can't recommend enough.
---
Also running sucks - fuck that.
---
Gravestone scepter is one of the very few things that matters for casters. Otherwise it's just basic stats; no extra damage other than the ability to sustain longer.
---
This is too hardcore and will get abused. 
---
You sound way too invested, and need to calm down.
---
Hmm reading your responses makes me wonder why you want to play Druid at all? I think you’d be happier rolling a mage or priest.
---
You absolutely do not need a gathering class. Take mining/skinning while levelling then drop skinning when you're 60 and level up blacksmithing. Depending on whether you can farm gold faster than farming+selling ore, either drop mining and buy your way to 300 engineering or farm thorium and sell it to buy the cheap ore you'll need to level engineering.
---
Darnassus looks amazing.  It's not organized particularly well, but it definitely looks great.
---
&gt;You can come up with moot points like they aren't progressing the server in exact fashion, but this is a core mechanic, as opposed to using the final balance patch as a base for talents. 
---
The talent changes would have an even greater impact on the game. Just look at the original talent trees. 
---
&gt;You are suggesting they remove something that was in the game from launch til TBC+, 
---
I didn't say they should remove it. I said there needs to be a better argument for having it. Do you have a source for when it was implemented or is that just an assumption?
---
I'm about to start playing through the Warcraft 3 campaign to put myself in the same mindset I was story wise the first time I played WoW.
---
??? I think you might not pick up on social queues or something, or maybe you think you're smart or something?  Literally everyone knows Activision Blizzard is a for profit, company.  I own some Activision stock for fucks sake.  But CD Projekt Red is also a for profit, publicly owned company, and they have always focused on making a good game above all- and somehow they still make profit.  Weird, right?
---
 we did the same and we'd have to rearrange a couple times just so the cuddle would align perfectly lol
---
Yeah I totally agree. I think I’m going to main warrior. One of the aspects I like about warrior is the fact that in most circumstances, I can justify taking loot since I’m going to need sword and board, dual wield, and a 2h. 
---
If the wpvp ever proves to be too much of a roadblock I’ll hop on my rogue and level at my own pace. Thanks for the help chief.
---
The login queue tends to make a few people change their mind.
---
What you are saying has literally nothing to do with the topic.
---
yeah there's a couple somewhat promising looking ones in the works, but they are done by smaller / new companies so it's like hmmm
---
I'd take those videos with a pinch of salt. The Paladin guides in particular are enlightening in how off the mark they are.
---
As for Druid vs Warrior, your Druid tank is going to gear up faster and output more threat that your warrior tank. They're also better for several encounters so any Guild worth their salt will want both.
---
For three people looking for casual raiding they'll be fine. There's always going to be Guilds looking to get people in slots regardless of whether they're MVP BIS MAX or not.
---
I onlyy ever remember frost mages being a problem. Other than that I cut through clothies like a hot knife through butter
---
Shame it didn't work at all until TBC :P.
---
This is not even remotely accurate
---
I was thinking night elf hunter originally, but the whole leeway and scattertrap DR thing, left me wondering if I'd lose most 1v1 fights in the later stages of the game.
---
Druid seems pretty great, I like the idea of being able to do everything I'm just scared of how many gear sets they need to be at their full potential, and I also heard they fall off when ppl get geared enough to burst them down.
---
Rogue could also be lots of fun and will probably feel the strongest I imagine, but aren't they too gear and especially weapon reliant? I can't imagine it being easy to get gear from pugs as af rogue. As far as I know, those naked roguecraft are from a ditfferent patch.
---
Paladins are fine from level 34 onwards :)
---
[Holy Light](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=1042) (big heal), vs Priest [Heal](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=6064) 
---
[Flash of Light](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19940) vs [Lesser Heal](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=2053)
---
The HPM for Holy Light and Heal is nearly the same, the cast time is quicker on Holy Light though, and not many priest would spec holy for reduced cast while leveling. Even for dungeon grinding, I'd argue the increased mana efficiency from disc would be favourable.
---
Flash of Light (at level 34) is their spammable heal, cost next to no mana, with a 1.5 second cast time. Crits will make you regain 100% of the mana cost. It's basically a faster and better rank 3 Lesser Heal. They are of course not comparable, but was mainly to show the efficiency of pala healing.
---
At level 34 your spec would look something like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzgR](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzgR), which means you have a free 100% chance to crit Holy Light every 2 minutes from Divine Favor, so basically whenever you need it. Really beats Inner Focus which only has 25% added crit chance and a 3min cooldown. Obviously, the priest has a much bigger kit, but paladin can be very efficient, even at level 30, though that upgraded Rank 3 spammable Flash of Light is really nice to have.
---
Maybe you need to ask yourself what it is that you want from games,  and what is it that you feel wow classic will fill. For me, it is meaningful progression.  So I have been playing factorio with extra complexity mods, and each time I progress in the tech tree, it's a major undertaking to produce even a portion of the required material.
---
lol, imagine being a leeway troll when this video was made on a private server and has no leeway in game.
---
Thanks aussieboy👍
---
I'd say warlock. You dont necessarily need to respec pve and pvp. Tailoring gains you some preraid bis. While they truly become monsters in aq40+ gear, you'll still be able to wreak havoc in rank 10 gear. Rogue is another good solo option, but you'll have a harder time going from pve to pvp with one spec, you'll be gimping yourself in one or the other.
---
No offense to OP but this seems a bit phishy. Be extremely cautious when downloading ZIP and Executable files from unknown/unproven sources. 
---
Mods should probably remove this until it can be independently verified that it works without any malicious side effects, or until its shown that it doesn't break the EULA
---
So essentially you want someone to audit each picture that is sent to confirm ninja looting? What will confirm this practice? What if a hunter takes something because it is an upgrade?
---
Then you also want a picture to show the set agreed upon rules upon initial group formation?
---
I have played long enough to say I haven’t seen enough ninja looters in my time. I think Reddit is over-dramatizing what it is
---
A bit late to the punchline considering the beta ends in 2 days.
---
Elemental specs are good for hybrid
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVtGz0czZVAGcobt
---
It depends what you're doing, but I like Blastwave better than Ice Barrier for BGs. With this spec, you can harass at range with frostbolt, and if you get jumped, you have a lot of escape options with nova, blastwave, cone of cold. maybe even an impact proc off of fire blast, which has reduced cooldown and crits big off of frost nova/frostbite.
---
People can use the add-ons they want I don't care, I just think it's funny that it was reported as a bug.
---
This is why server clusters are a great idea.  Even if the population doesn't drop, those servers act as stable, individual realms.
---
0/20/31 is good with imp scorch
---
The big servers never died in vanilla, they kept getting more people trying to join them for years and years.
---
 For sure, the one problem though with bodyweight is that it's harder to train the legs. There are ways to do it but it's trickier. Exercises like pistol squats are very advanced and takes a lot of time before you are able to perform them.
---
 A regular person though who just want to have a little bit of muscle, be lean and healthy doesn't need to do any particular leg training( controversial statement perhaps, "no leg day" meme and all that). 
---
 Just doing different kinds of pull ups, dips and push up variations combined with some form of cardio and good diet will give you a fit healthy body. Say 30 min every other day for the dips, pull ups and push ups, and cardio in the form of briskly walking for 45 min per day( combine the walk with stuff like listening to a podcast or something). Doing that is not going to turn you into a muscle monster but you will notice results if you are not someone who has worked out much.

Sift through the whole topic, but in the permalink above someone posted a screenshot from a private server showcasing that the melee leeway is the same on the 1.12 old client as it is on the beta. It's not a bug or a change. Spell queue has nothing to do with it - it's designed for latency differences only.
---
Never in all my time of playing WoW has this ever happened.
---
CoE was much much better
---
You really think thats a literal 1:1 comparison I was expressing? No one is that callus or tonedeaf. At least I hope not. It's only an analog to express a sense of letting something go when you really don't want to, but have no control over it's future fate.
---
Anyone who legitimately thought my use of that comparison was literal, needs to interract with actual human beings a bit more often.
---
Right - but I can see someone calling a person a ninja for such a thing. "you can't use that" yes I can, I can sell it for gold. I will sell it to you for a reduced price.
---
This is how I played classic back in the day. I used to PvP and raid top tier, too. Ultra comfort
---
Anyone who played vanilla and TBC know Wrath was terrible. Only Wrath babbies think otherwise.

Jesus, the hunter and rogue can get more out of a BiS BoE Warrior item, then the Warrior. Seriously what a ninja looter. Lmfao sad people have to be thief's in a game. Lol trash
---
For Alliance, probably Darnassus. There won't be as many people wanting portals, but the people who do want them will want them a lot more.
---
For Horde, probably Kargath. It's nothing, in the middle of nowhere, but it's the closest FP to Blackrock and Uldaman.
---
Zeroed made the state ofHunter seem way better than it is. He mentioned like 2 bugs and talked as If the rest are already fixed or just minor visual stuff, which is simply Not true.

I guess you have a point there. That might happen. But from what I remember in vanilla the big servers stayed crowded for many years because no one wanted to stop playing on them.
---
Don’t worry, drama will come from that advertisement alone
---
A lot of people seem to recoil at these sort of numbers, and for good reason: they're not real-world accurate. Firstly, unless you're fantastically slow at leveling (no judgement, you just seem to be keen on hitting 60), then you'll do much faster than the average. Secondly, you're bound to have a free day or evening at a weekend at some point. I work 60 hour weeks, have a long term girlfriend etc. and can still carve out days when she is away or busy. Most sessions might only be an hour, but there'll be longer ones. Or just stop sleeping.
---
Very neat that a different class won every tournament.
---
Doesn’t generalize well since it’s lvl 30-40 and the bracket draw can affect who proceeds but still cool that there’s some diversity in how OP the classes are while leveling.
---
Having pre Dire Maul items will help you progress faster which means more of dem sweet drops. At the same time having bis pre raid is a way to show you are serious about raiding and you care about your guild.
---
I see no facts here. Blizzard do not send C&amp;D because private servers distribute clients. This is an entirely other matter that they are responsible by laws to defend their IP. If they did not "take action", it would weaken their claim to classic as they No longer provide the game. This changes with classic obv.
---
Just because you caps ILLEGAL does not make your argument BETTER.
---
Not soo much after an easier life. Just kinda looking for something that isn't lower in the food chain in regards to wpvp when mc geared and whilst leveling
---
Hilarious. I just noticed that last night and want to hit the ceremonial piece pipe.
---
All I have to say is this: I'm so jealous that you get to experience WoW for the first time. Like anything in life, you can't recapture what something was like the very first time. You guys are going to have so much fun.
---
Mmmmmmmm, IDK. It'll be interesting for me to see how Druids fit in to top tier raiding now.
---
Some top end guilds, or want to be top end guilds I know of, have the philosophy of 1 druid is enough, and that druid is a resto/balance hybrid just there to make sure the raid has a GotW buff, fearie fire and that insect swarm goes up. Outside of that, they dont like the level of healing a druid brings, dont like either specs for dps (as I think most people would understand) and plan on being hardcore enough that their warriors wont gear up much slower, and will probably chug rage pots to keep their threat up. 
---
But I mean, thats purely top end, hard-hardcore raiding, and its all theory. If someone guild comes out with 1 of their tanks being a druid (or more) I wouldnt be horribly surprised. I definitely think some variation in available tanks is a good idea over running purely warriors, but thats a personal philosophical view. I havent run any numbers or done any testing. Pretty much just a feeling.
---
If the population does drop, you will have dead (sub)servers, one of the things they're trying to avoid with layering
---
It’s really a question of the stun resist or the CD, since undead doesn’t really have anything comparable to blood fury so that’s just an additional positive for being orc.
---
Most people will recommend orc, the stun resist is just a huge advantage and it’s a flat % with no cooldown necessary.
---
Obviously the UD racial is strong, but it’s a decent length CD and you have no advantage when it has been used.
---
yeah, maybe I could push 4 hours a day. But thats the max I can.
---
I dont mind having other person being the raid leader, wouldnt be a problem. For dungeons, I guess the Tank kinda "needs" to be the leader, right?
---
And i have 8 hours per day instead of 2 before I need to go to sleep compared to "most people here" at your job.
---
With 35 days paid vacation each year, and free from work during holidays with pay I can travel and do a lot of things.
---
But yeah, if he only has 1 hour per day... That's messed up :/
---
Alliance might give you the short term fix of beautiful (in your eyes at least haha) questing zones, but as you say yourself, the Horde is your Home. In the long run, you will miss your Tauren brothers and sisters as well as knowing that you belong to the Horde. Welcome back my friend and may the eternal sun shine upon you.
---
Yup it’s great. I don’t recommend raiding or grouping with anyone though if they’re trying to be serious. End up playing like shit and get nothing done.

---
Yeah it’s on private so you might be right
---
It's not really a rpg mmo anymore. Retail is a lot of fun for what it is though.
---
Will be playing an undead mage. Troll racial is considered "best" on the horde side, but offers very little additional DPS. Rather have Will of the Forsaken for fears.
---
Layering is not guaranteed to last the entirety of phase 1. That just the maximum amount of time layering is possible. It can just as well be gone in 2-3 weeks.
---
How is this not more upvoted?  I spent many hours doing this for the class I'm going to roll.  This is an insanely good guide.
---
You will pvp and pve as arcane/frost, the only thing you really lose with pve spec is improved counterspell so use your pve spec. In later phases when you are rich just respec for desired content
---
Blasphemy!
---
why not just all roll need to begin with instead?
---
Dude, you said I was branding people, who disagreed, as "ninjas". Since you seem to have forgotten already, here again the quote:
---
&gt;You are trying to brand people you disagree with as “ninjas”.
---
I just reiterated and further explained what I said when I called some hypothetical person a ninja. Here ya go with my original statement:
---
&gt; But if everybody accepts this rule, except for you and you roll need when it drops, then: News flash: you are the ninja in the group.
---
Anyways, good talk ... it has been real fun.
---
Yes, that's exactly the point. It is *by far* the best idea anyone has put forward (PS: It's not my idea, it's been floating around for over a year now). It's nowhere close to a "fantastically bad idea", that's what current layering is.
---
This could just as well be titled: The issue with vanilla WoW in 2019.
---
If it's not what you want then you don't have to play it.
---
To be fair I played vanilla hard core and I didn’t realize there wasn’t quest location tracking. I remember the blue “zones/outlines” being added later but I thought there was a small circle marker in vanilla, so I probably just had an add-on and didn’t realize it wasn’t part of the base game.
---
But working out without adjusting diet is asking to fail. Eating food better than junk is also not that expensive, especially to people who plan on playing a video game. They need a PC, High speed internet and a monthly subscription. Cutting out restaurant meals (even fast food)and cooking for yourself will save a lot of money and be much healthier.
---
&gt; what is the effect of this extra range?
---
It gives you extra range. Why would you describe extra range as 'fast abilities'? Would it make sense for you if the tooltip for the hunter talent 'Hawk Eye' stated it made your abilities go off faster? Of course not. Extra range is simply extra range.
---
I don't know what it is about people like you that causes you to be unable to ever admit you made a mistake. Check your ego for like 3 seconds and just admit that you described melee leeway poorly.
---
I still don't see how spell queuing and melee leeway are in any way related. Queuing just lets you get your abilities off in a smoother manner without having to spam your keybinds as hard when trying to get in range. 
---
Leeway just gives you extra range while moving.
---
They are unrelated imo.
---
&gt;cannandrum
---
conundrum
---
In my experience, anyone who calls everyone "kid" is generally an ignorant little shit. I did play vanilla, queues of 1 or sometimes even 2 hours weren't uncommon on friday/saturday nights. That shit might  have been somewhat acceptable back then, but it won't fly for players nowadays.
---
Thinking of going shaman over priest to level with my buddy who is going warrior. I was a rogue and priest in vanilla so wanting to try something new.
---
How annoying was totem management in raids? Was there a token ele shaman in raids similar to one shadowpriest? It’s been so long I really don’t remember if we ever used one.
---
tbh I think they did just about enough :) This video definitely makes me think better of it than I did before, at least :)
---
&gt; The group didn't agree to shit. You are just holding their time hostage to implement new rules, which allows you to acquire an unfair distribution of the loot.
---
Now you are presuming things. It might very well be the case that they agree.
---
Hahaha no you fucking nerd, grow up
---
/cybers in goldshire for six hours
---
This is new though, it wasn’t like that in retail vanilla.
---
I'm hoping I can do some AOE grinding, but since I'm going to start levelling on 08/27 and not later, single target + spellpower is going to likely be much more efficient due to AOE competition.
---
Reading is for the Alliance - who needs books when you can fight?!
---
No problem, hope you get to enjoy both the satisfaction of crafting awesome armour and the satisfaction of detonating a sapper charge while bubbled under a big pile of horde :)
---
They are bis for hunters
---
I don't believe you've never seen Karazhan.
---
Why aren't they possible?
---
Bank alts exist. How would you know it's the same guy selling it?
---
Thanks a lot man :) Glad you like my other work too!!
---
Josh's podcast was really great to be on - hopefully we can do it again one day!
---
no such thing as light resistance so that shouldn't be a issue for a priest. actually if you're going to be dpsing you'll be using mostly shadow spells so it wouldn't matter either way. also all casters have damaging spells for a few schools of magic so it will be quite rare thaat you're helpless because everything gets resisted. you may have to use suboptimal spells but it will probably be enough. also mages warlocks and priests use wands as a ranged weapon and it can happen that the elemental damage from it is from a school of magic your character doesn't even use.
---
It became the altar of storms.
---
i tried to click the red cross instead of the tab cross ... too much wow
---
Your not too far off from reality, couple of things I have been thinking about. 
---
Im taking 3 vacation days for release. These three days and the weekend Ill get 60+ hours of play time in of leveling, and nostalgia. I dont plan on all of the hours being speed leveling, as I plan to dungeon a few times, and  gather and do professions, but for the most part, this beginning stage will get me a good chunk of the way through leveling all up front. (Well actually, vaca shortly after release, because launches are always a shit show and I didnt want to waste the vaca time on server reboots fo 10000 people all at the same starter zone). so make some room for an all day sesh here and there. Take a weekend and claim it as a wow holiday and make no plans and do no chores or anything.
---
Also, follow a leveling guide. Ill do dungeons and stuff that arent on the guide, but i feel that there is always a lot of time traveling. Quest guides will ensure your travel time is most efficient.
---
Batch up those weekly taks and play time. Instead of 5x 30 minute sessions, do 2x 1.25 hour sessions and 3x days not playing. Longer play times are more efficient. I have noticed with leveling that 2 hours seems to be a perfect session length for me where I can get a decent chunk of content done. 
---
 Also, make sure your hearth is set to your current quest hub if you will be doing short play sessions. If you set it to SW or Ironforge, and you spend the first 8 minutes of every 30 minute play sessions traveling to the quest hub, waste of time.
---
I only plan to play for like 2 hours a night 3x nights a week, and I still expect to be 60 in 5 months-ish due to the initial surge of play time and the rare 6 hour play sesh on the weekend here or there.
---
I've AOE levelled a few times with stam/int stacking, but I don't think that's an effective method for Classic.  Likely be forced to do single target + spell power
---
Omg youre right, thanks!
---
Jumping squats and assisted pistols are not that hard I'd say. Glute bridges, calf raises and stuff are also nice.
---
yeah + your class trinket already removes fear, so you dont need x2 fear remove.
---
&gt; **Not all of them at once** but those of "all of them" that are currently on the same layer as you.
---
This is the problem. If you were all on the same world together it would be fine. It would be busy as hell, but it would be fine. Obviously the best solution is to split them up and merge later. Nobody is going to be bothered by not being able to meet people from other layers immediately.
---
&gt; Layering is the less jarring alternative to rapid server mergers.
---
This is so far from the truth. Server merging would happen once (or at least a finite amount of times) and it would happen overnight. Layering is something you'll have to deal with every single hour of every single day, and you get to watch it happen right in front of your eyes while you play. That is ten thousand percent more jarring.
---
Yeah none of that is truly ground breaking today. Have to remember that consoles tend to be a bit behind PC games in what they are able to do however.  Here is an interesting list of the largest game world's today and WoW only ranks #11. 
---
https://gamicus.gamepedia.com/List_of_largest_game_worlds
---
What specc would you use for both?
---
Also, do you not think being alliance makes warlock a worse option? I can imagine tremor and will of the forsaken being a pain.
---
maybe check how some druid item sets will look on both genders and make your choice. you can use go on wowhead and use their 3d model viewer
---
You are also mana inefficient and cause way more threat since you don't have frost channeling and clearcasting
---
Never played WoW but in Skyrim I would always eat, then sleep before I would log off. Sometimes I’d even get them ready for bed by putting my character into pajama-Isk clothing.
---
Super torn between maining a Tauren Shaman vs Druid.
---
Some background on me:
---
I mostly raided during TBC and WOTLK, usually maining a priest. I usually was holy, but started maining shadow in SSC, then would switch between shadow and holy depending on raid needs in WOTLK.
---
Overall I enjoy healing classes that have a dps "off" spec. I've been playing a druid recently on retail which has been neat, before that I was firming in the shaman camp, but now I'm so much less sure.
---
Any input is greatly appreciated!
---
My pleasure, man! I don't think you will run into much trouble with adequate gear. And things just get better with level with skills like intercept, and overpowered for those pesky rogues.
---
There are City of Heroes private servers now.  You can play on them until Classic releases, just like I did back in the day (and am doing right now).  Party like it's 2004!
---
The whole point of sunservers is they share a name pool and you proactively merge them before they are dead.
---
Also, Blizzard has no clue how much population will drop, so odds are you are either stuck with layering or get dead servers anyways that are not prepared to merge.
---
Im on the struggle bus myself mostly to not hop on Northdale and practice my leveling route and stuff because I know as soon as Classic launches its will be for naught. Though I will say a few of my buddies that more actively play on Northdale/Lightbringer say they wont be coming over to Classic because they have already invested so much time in the Pserver community.
---
&gt; dynamic respawning
---
The whole point of layering is so that they don't have to implement dynamic respawns.  That's so much incredibly worse for the game than layering ever was.
---
"LF 1 Healer SFK layer 7"
---
It was a joke, sort if like, it would be an insult to cancer to compare it to bfa
---
You left the campfire going....I have some bad news about darnassus.
---
A passive stun resist helps against more classes than WotF which is why I'm going orc on my rogue. A nice bonus when fighting paladins, warriors, rogues, druids, shadow priests or anyone with a grenade vs a nice bonus every 3 mins when fighting warriors, priests and warlocks.
---
I did this most in MoP where I had a specific spot I would always go to in the Horde hub. I also did a lot of that in Legion in the warlock order hall
---
Farm cloth, farm droppable tradeskill mats, farm high value grey and white drops, farm lower instances and sell/de the greens and blues, just run dungeons and sell dropables greys etc, farm the AH, buy gold, steel from your guild bank, make a naked female night elf and dance on mailboxes for tips, duel for gold, make a farming alt and do mara/DM runs.... its kinda hard to do anything in this game other than bgs and not make gold
---
Frost*?
---
Hola amigo! Yo no juego mas al WoW soy de Argentina, pero jugue facilmente 6 años de mi vida, es el juego mas hermoso y divertido que jugue por lejos... en fin para decirte que WoW y alguna q otra cancion en ingles me enseñaron el 98% del ingles que se (el otro 2% seria de peliculas y la escuela) y tengo un ingles fluido casi perfecto. Un saludo!
---
99% of the time there is no agreement, then what?
---
Until the best guild(s) of the realm leaves, because they are tired of having people in queues during raid hours...
---
That's a really good point. Good catch.
---
I still think warriors will be terrors in smaller BGs, but that has always been the case.
---
I would not play on TBC. I liked at the time, but I would not play again. Too many features that I did not like: flying mounts, resilence, raids without attunements at the end, arenas and dailys. Idk, the HE was quite good but overall for me is much worst than Vanila. Imo, what they should do is develop Classic content with the same spirit than Vanila and everyone is gonna be happy. Also they could sell this content as DLC packs and make Classic much profitable for Bli$$ard. The only thing is that they should keep the level cap at 60 and keep the normal progression already stablished, so the worst problem to solve would be the power creep. If they know how to deal with that, would be perfect.
---
Honestly as a shaman if you want to gear up quickly, try to get into a guild that doesn't have many other shamans in their raid. All guilds want to stack like 8 shamans ideally but there isn't enough people playing shaman for that so only the best guilds will do that. And if you're the 8th shaman in your raid you're never getting good gear.
---
Everytime to this day.
---
They forgot to capitalize the I in the reply.
---
&gt; Every single person playing on the streamer server are people who want to play with the streamers.
---
Well this is just blatantly false. Many of the streamers aren’t even revealing their server choice. There will be plenty of people rolling on those servers without knowing any certain streamer is there and plenty that would be disappointed to find out their chosen server has toxic streamers on it.
---
You can farm lasher packs in DM East, also farm the Demon packs in East, which drop Felcloth/runecloth and those BoP rune things that are used in several crafting patterns. You can also clear packs and farm mats for the +Int food.
---
I leveled 55-60 in DM East.
---
Can you actually tell what layer number you are on in classic beta?  I don't think there's going to be as much where people will advertise a layer...  you'd just see that as "LF 1 Healer SFK"
---
Depends if you want to initially get to 60 fast, if you are wanting to be in that top 5% of server 60s I would focus on leveling just one, maybe 2 if you are experienced enough at it.
---
I have been devouring this podcast at an unhealthy rate
---
That was one thing I always loved about FF14. You could go to an inn and "rent" a room (it didn't actually cost you anything). Once in the room you had a few options like managing transmog, playing some mini games, and there was a bad. By clicking on the bed and choosing go to sleep, it would log you out, and when you logged in it would play an animation of your character walking up.
---
It's the little shit like that which make up the living, breathing world of an MMO. No one cares as much to do the same daily chore in hopes of maybe RNGing a good purple and maybe that will RNG into a Titanforge.
---
Absolutely agreed, they simply need to open the servers up at 12k and let it all work itself out. People can change to other servers and remake a character after they see the mess they are in sooner rather than later. People playing will fix it. Layers are an illusion that keep people from migrating and adjusting to what needs to happen.
---
Thinking you are entitled to 500+ gold simply because your class happens to be able to use the item that dropped is the only greed here. If you really needed the item, you would buy it. 90% of the time, you aren't actively trying to get that item. It just fell onto your lap, and you feel entitled to have it. You might not even use it and sell it, you might already know the Flask recipe and are lying.
---
&gt; But I mean, thats purely top end, hard-hardcore raiding
---
That's exactly it though. Most people aren't in top end hardcore raiding guilds, and people posting these sort of questions aren't really going to be them.
---
There's a systemic problem on forums, youtube and elsewhere that everything is weighed and measured in a very niche environment which most people don't play in. That's not to say the information is wrong, it's just not strictly relevant.
---
This is correct. If being a 7 foot tall blue hunchback with tusks that talks like Bob Marley is wrong, I don’t want to be right.
---
Do you think there’s any noticeable difference in race choice for alliance? I know dwarves and gnomes are preferable for pvp for stoneform and escape artist but I’d much rather play human or nelf. 
---
How impactful is the human’s wep skill bonus / perception / rep gain bonus vs a night elves dodge chance and shadowmeld? Not to forget wisp form because I’m sure I’ll have to do my fair share of corpse runs.
---
yes thank god for a sensible post. I hate it when people downvote comments about layering we need it lol but not forever ...
---
Can we all agree that our voices won't mean anything when it comes to layering decision making?
---
What's the difference between leveling 2 vs 3 vs 5? Other than at 5 you can do most instances alone?
---
I had my home in IF!! I miss my home...
---
Warlocks can also farm DME lashers. It's just labor-intensive.
---
I think we all want the layering to go ASAP but its not really in our hands
---
Im my ideal world layering lasts 2 weeks and thats about it, if the server is still a bit crowed then so be it, at least most will be out of the start zones and a little spread out.
---
make shamans, chain lightning is OP with multiboxing, not only you can 1 shot 3 people with a single cast, but your survivability is really high.
---
you can make 1 shaman healer, and just cast chain heal to heal your whole party, mana totem for mana...
---
Couldn't agree more, I advise you to join the conversations in your regional blizzard forums dedicated to wow classic.  
---
We managed to convince blizzard that we need regional server and I'm sure they hear our concerns there aswell!
---
Dire Maul is phase 2, unless they changed it since I last looked.
---
But... vanilla didn’t have it. I thought you guys were looking for a true vanilla experience?
---
You two are weird. WPL and EPL are like one of the coolest areas in the game and are a pleasure to grind.
---
If you want to see depressing, look at Desolace. There ain't even undead invading the place, there's NOTHING. It's just DESOLATE.
---
Still have to try we can't just give up. Don't get me wrong I support layering but I don't want them to push it back because it benefits them. I just haven't had 100% trust in Blizzard recently.
---
I quit retail about 4 years ago, all the hype around classic made me realize that I still love WoW, I just didnt like what WoW became. When I quit I was thinking "oh, I'm just bored of raiding so i'm bored of WoW" because I didnt remember all the other ways I had fun in Vanilla. I think it just takes a while to realize how much something has changed, especially if it is an MMO you can play for years with not even a thought of quitting if you are heavily invested.
---
Still fucked up tho.
---
I cant make any promises but Ill try my best...
---
I'm imagining I will be a lot more efficient now than I was when I was a 13 year old kid playing this. I intend to do everything with a purpose, no wasted time standing around doing nothing etc.. That is the one way I am hoping to make better use of my time than previously.
---
i basically agree, but for the example of edgemasters, you can never tell if a warrior will use them. how would you even know if hes going fury or prot at 60? or let alone raid at all.
---
Serpen-tyne
---
I hate layering but it really is needed. The game will be unplayable. I do want a true vanilla experience but I think this has to be done, it is sad but true.
---
you never knew Karazhan was Medivh's tower or that it existed in-game? Also it's a massive raid in TBC and a fan favorite. They even remade it for Legion.
---
I really want to roll with a Hunter. After reading some of the posts on here about how bad the Hunters are bugged I feel like I should move onto something else. What’s everyone’s opinion on that?
---
Blade Flurry being on a 2 minute cooldown being their only cleaving ability while warriors get cleave, sweeping strikes, and whirlwind.  
---
I’m not saying it’s impossible since I know Jack about vanilla rogues, but I don’t see a lot of discussion or plans involving them.
---
Moonkin can absolutely slaughter people with just green +nature damage gear.
---
Granted you need like 6 seconds of uninterrupted cast time, and with that gear you are liable to fold like a house of cards under any pressure... But they don't rely on CDs or anything so if lucky you can just spam nonstop.
---
If the group is being pushy, the war could equip the sword, show the group, then go back to their previous weapon.
---
One of the main reasons you pick a priest to be your healer is spirit tap. You can get nearly 100% uptime on it as long as your melee are paying attention and they let the priest get killing blows.
---
Priest just stacks the dogshit out of spirit and gets boatloads of mana through spirit tap. Without this you will certainly have alot more downtime with any other healer.
---
I would di this EVERYTIME if i was in a city or small town
---
Well, look at it this way: What does protecting them imply? A GM putting invisible walls around the event and making anyone who wants to get in need a teleport? A GM using their insta-gib command on anyone who interferes? Taking account action against anyone who intentionally interrupts?
---
I don't think that anything which discourages pvp's biggest motivator (conflict) is better for a game's pvp scene in any capacity. Unless an exploit is involved (like someone killing from somewhere they can't be reached like underneath Orgrimmar), pvp actions need pvp responses.
---
Oh lol that didn't come across at ALL dude! My mistake in that case, though my point still stands for anybody else who feels the need to get offended. :)
---
it's more or less the same. just black morass is blasted lands now. Otherwise it's just a less detailed version of the current world
---
Yeah and the option to do 3 types of farming makes it less tedious
---
You really think that a 4 hour wait could be caused by load on the auth server?
---
Druids don't have any problems getting into a group - as long as you are healing.  Occasionally a 5 man dungeon will take a druid to tank, but warrior is almost always preferred.
---
^This. Their trinket doesn't remove stun and it does remove the same things as WotF. I'd rather a chance at resisting stuns than removing 2 fears.
---
Blizz has a rough estimate of how much population will drop based on their own analytics. You can also reach this conclusion yourself by looking at any google trend or steamchart for any online game in the past decade.
---
So actually, odds are they are actually doing the right thing with layering.
---
meh... I like undead becouse they look cool in end game raid/pvp armor and have sick stealth animations and attacks.
---
I don't like the stealth animations for orc
---
The other big advantage for alchemy is all your products can be placed on the auction house and sold at any time, where an enchanter has to apply the enchant through the trade window. This greatly increases the time investment for selling your product.
---
Is that true on 1.12? Think you start seeing +spell damage as early as Acidic Walkers.
---
Played druid and warlock in vanilla.  Obviously a presence of mind mage will give you the highest burst damage, but a destruction warlock can do a ton of burst without relying on a 3 minute cooldown talent.  Druids are mid to low tier for burst damage.  They can hit hard for sure, but their damage is more about control + dots, like moonfire/rip/insect swarm.  If you don't mind pet classes pick a lock or hunter, if you just want to throw spells and you're fine with playing around cooldowns, go with mage.
---
I only played Horde and need meant "I will use this on this character."
---
Greed for anything less.
---
Sadly even that seems too complicated for people at times. We might set loot threshold to blues or epics or something.
---
You keep calling a superior system greedy because you can't comprehend that it's better in every way and PREVENTS greed.  There is absolutely 0 reason for everyone to roll greed it provides no benefit and only let's people be dicks and that's the system you want to defend.  Big dumb bro.
---
Guess I should have been more specific about 'better'. Basically in terms of threat and gear threshold. A recently dinged druid can waltz into MC with random blues and a MCP and generate more threat than his equivalent warrior, whilst still being adequately durable is really what I mean.
---
With how prevalent grenades will be in competitive PvP I think we'll see more stuns than you think.
---
Intimidation and improved wing clip are not worth losing so much damage over. This build is not great in pvp and complete garbage in pve since you will do such low damage. If you want improved wingclip then go 0/21/30 and if you want intimidation go 31/20/0, there really isn't a good build that has both.
---
how would you tell? naive trust in his words or are you some kind of fortune teller?
---
Because thats the wrong way of doing it.
---
If you NEED the boe and will equip it then you roll NEED
---
If you don't...then you greed it.  
---
If the item is worth a lot you don't get to need it for money.  That is greed
---
The biggest downside to having 3 seperate servers that will merge is that those will be 3 distinct communities up until the merge. So you won't have a chance to meet 2/3 of your "server" for potentionally the entire first phase.
---
With layering you won't be able to meet everyone at once. But you won't have a hard cutoff from most of your server.
---
This just in: Classic WoW projected to be a huge hit among young moms who just need some alone time. Details to follow so stay tuned!
---
hey I mean, thats why I qualify the statement... I dont disagree, look at my original post... Its essentially saying OP and his friends will be fine so long as their endgoal isnt hardcore gaming...
---
Eh' s' obvious... good luck to anyone who blindly picks a streamer server by accident and aren't ready for 15k players trying to log in at the same time.
---
But wouldn't you be able to run a second DPS trinket over the PvP trinket?
---
I like walking, honestly. I keep a brisk pace, but its a great way to get outside and see the neighborhood/area. If I need higher intensity, I'll jump on a treadmill and set the incline!
---
One big server is shutting down, there are still 100s and 100s of other servers, with all expansions from classic to legion.
---
While standing is better than sitting, don’t confuse it with being active.
---
Hunters are great in classic, bugs have a ton of time to be fixed and the playstyle has a ton of options. Hunters and Druids are my favorite because you can switch to a completely different playstyle if you get bored
---
When I was in university I was told this was unhealthy, little did I know I was Intermittent Fasting before it was cool!
---
It is not better because it is better for the economy to not have 3 servers running at all times that are going to be merged. During non-prime time layered servers will only have 1 layer to get resources from instead of 3 up 24/7. It is better for community to have people you have seen before instead of dumping a bunch of new faces on you after a merge. Laying at least gives you a chance to see everyone you can play with instead of the 100% chance to not see everyone. Server merges are huge disruptions to the economy as there is by design less population (per server) and more resources floating around before the merge.
---
&gt; no spell dmg plate
---
Literally paladin T2.
---
&gt;How is this not more upvoted?
---
If you look into this guy a bit more, you'll see why that might be a good thing. He's... quite the character, not the one you want to give a place in the spotlight.
---
He also hangs around /v/, spamming his own videos before replying to his own posts, trying to fake interest. I guess he's posting here now, seeing as he usually gets called out and ignored over there.
---
so your reasoning is that because classic is not 100% nochanges then it’s fine to change more stuff?
---
If so you’ve just proven the slippery slope
---
You really can't imagine a leader that doesn't lose his cool?
---
I’m in the exact the same boat. I’m leaning more Druid just because they have less of a population might lead to gearing easier? But on the other hand the burst of Ele/Resto specs seems awesome and hard to pass up.
---
Is it really that big an issue though? I mean, the deadzone's area will be larger, but the distance is the same
---
Tauren or Orc warrior? I like taurens more, but everytime I pvp on an orc on undocumented servers I change my mind to orc. Resisting 5 point kidneys is nuts.
---
but you are a rouge, you can swap trinket in vanish if you like :)
---
Instead of making these posts why not keep asking how long phase 1 is going to last? They have said, multiple times, that layering will be removed once phase 1 is complete. Period. No ifs ands or buts. I think everyone would shut the fuck up about this if there was an actual date or at least a guestimation on when phase 1 ends.
---
I just remember having to read the quest text 3 times, once to know where to go and then to figure out what I needed to kill and then one last time to actually figure out what I need to kill.
---
God bless the guy who made thottbot!
---
Eh, you will be in for a rude awakening. Warriors lose to most classes 1v1, unless you outgear them by a lot. Warriors need a pocket healer.
---
Ele sham brings nothing to the table for the raid like shadow weaving does, and runs out of mana faster so their dps is kind of worse than shadow.
---
Totem maagement is the fun you make of it.  Some find that management the entire point and fun of the class, others find it an annoyance.  If you dont think you will find it interesting, then the class has very little depth left to you and I personally wouldn't recommend playing it.
---
This should be easy.  The only "off spec" for a shaman is dps.  A druid can tank 5 man dungeons easily, or off tank in a raid.  If tanking doesn't appeal to you, go shaman.  If it does, go druid.  You also get your choice of healing.  Druid hots vs shaman chain healing.
---
Which is why the post began with "also".
---
They are definitely reminiscent of the Redwall maps!
---
http://www.oocities.org/redwallhq/mapredwall.jpg
---
Kingdom Come: Deliverance
---
PvP isn't generally 1 v 1 on a battleground .  it is hard to stop a warrior with a paladin on his nuts.  Freedom and cleanse spam is just so good.
---
This is low level pleb thinking.  Ahurrdadurr I do this because that's what everyone else does!  Weak
---
Why is it "probably" a high number? You have zero evidence that the limit is too high. The only way we'll know of Blizzards calculations are correct is a few months after classic releases.
---
Orc.  You can equip the pvp trinket to get the fear break and the stun resistance is OP
---
Uhh. Warriors are the worst dueling class at 60 lol.
---
I don’t think you need any money, or much space for push ups, sit ups, etc.
---
It's very rare and far between. Not enough to make a noticable difference. Good Wands and decent mana/spirit is what you go for when leveling.
---
People are not going tp be def capped in MC. Def cap is a massive joke and threat is far more important.
---
300 ping? I had 50 ping during vanilla in sweden, anything above 100 was considered bad.
---
not entirely sure, and it seems tough to find anything reliable online; https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=45&amp;t=3950
---
It may be that you still have to re-level to 225 and then use that book, but I've never used it before, as it wasn't available in pservers I rolled on, and never knew about it in retail times. Here's to hoping :_)
---
I don't think you're understanding my point at all. I'm arguing a different concept to what you seem to be implying. 
---
Even then, classic launch will have a lot of tourists, I think you're under estimating how many people from different games will play for only a month or so. Sure the population from there on will be a steady increase, but you'll see a lot of streamers pulling in all their communities from fortnite to league of legends and a lot of them won't stay for long.
---
Because I don't worry about being "suboptimal". I just want to play the character I like the most. I've played a lot of WoW and I've never encountered a situation where being "suboptimal" meant "unplayable".
---
Where on earth are you getting this idea from? It's the opposite, it is way more profitable in vanilla than on privas.
---
On private servers they completely removed Rogue's Diaries because it was "too profitable" in the admins minds. But these 50 silver vendor trash items are very common pickpocketing loot in vanilla.
---
Also once you have full epic gear you can solo farm LBRS for "Plans: Arcanite Reaper", each sells for a few hundred gold. Also another rare nearby the one that drops the Arcanite Reaper plans drops some other few hundred gold item, I forget what it was. Only a Rogue can solo farm this particular area, even though a Hunter could also kill the elite mobs, they won't be able to navigate this room without aggroing everything.
---
there are greens that sell for 1000+ gold and purples barely worth 10g...
---
give this guy some upvotes. I m impressed. One of the first "guide" with actual WoW Classic stats and not a misleading Pserver bullsh.t
---
From what I remember can't the PvP trinket work on stuns too?
---
Yes vanilla isn't all that balanced or straight forward. Epic doesn't necessarily mean more powerful than a blue. And just because something is rare doesn't mean its going to make your character stronger than common things. There's no thieves in what I've said everyone gets a chance to roll on it.   
---
All group members get an equal chance at that power  for their character. If the non warriors win they get to sell it and buy multiple items to upgrade their character. If the warrior wins he can either equip it or sell it and buy multiple other items.
---
How did instance resetting work in the beta?
---
Not including UBRS items makes no sense and you will definitely want many from there.
---
Not to mention he did include truestrike shoulders which are actually from UBRS.
---
&gt;Classic is not going to fix your life.
---
Lol life advice on reddit, nobody here said their life was broken but good to see you've not had any excitement while looking forward to something in your life!
---
&gt;8.2 WoW isnt even a bad option as AP isnt as brutal of a grind, theres a lot to do at your own pace and Mythic + and the likes is better than it ever has been. 
---
🤣🤣🤣 - this is too funny, but makes sense now, you've never played classic and are just touring... enjoy your stay!
---
&gt;Let's not pretend almost 1/4 of every raid in mages is going to be spamming frost bolt only for every raid boss.
---
Defends 8.2 yet mages do the same thing 15 years later in the modern game.
---
Take care bud, good luck next year in 8.3!
---
Tanking is easy to pick up, hard to master.  You'll learn the role as you do dungeons while you level, so I wouldnt worry too much about having no experience (everyone started like that one way or another).
---
No, probably not.  Raid tanks need to have almost 100% attendance since they get the tank gear and the raid fully relies on them being available for virtually ever raid, otherwise the 39 other people can't even raid.  The experience wouldn't be a factor (it's ultimately way simpler in raids), but time is the big one.
---
Yeah you should learn dps and keep a dps/tanking set for sure.  Any class with more than one role should honestly strive to learn thme all.
---
* I can see their class
---
* I can see their race
---
* I can see the role they are in the dungeon with
---
Dunno why I would need to rely on their word or need to be a fortune teller.
---
You can run a holy shock/ret build

---
My buddy who was running a healer did something similar. You can PvE heal perfectly fine, your solo farm DPS isn't terrible as long as you get a weapon with a proc that gains bonus damage from spell power. 
---
It doesn't come into light until you get Judgement T2 though, since it's plate with spell power.
---
I'd suggest the southern Blasted Lands demons over the Winterspring ones. In addition to the Eye, they also drop the Grimoire of Doom that teaches you Ritual of Doom.
---
I was always told to play witcher 3 but looking at the graphics(not awful) but surely dated... I feel like I missed the boat on it.
---
If you're forced to choose a layer at character creation, there will be dead layers from day one.  
---
If they create x number of layers for all servers, some of those layers will be more popular just on the basis that there will be more people on them.  Say some streamer will be on Realm Y-1, so more people will want to be on Y-1 either to be around the streamer or to try to grief the streamer and their followers or to play on what they know will be the higher pop layer.  This means there will be less people to choose Y-2 through Y-5 because you can't move between them.   
---
If you dynamically add another layer when the previous gets "full" (which you can't even know what that means since number of characters does not equal number of concurrent players), the last layer you create will have the fewest number of people,  maybe not even 100 concurrent players at any one time.
---
All anger is comical in that getting angry is stupid because it happens because you're not getting what you want, and it makes getting what you want even harder.
---
Well, you're not getting the cloth caster items, so basically you'll be aiming for your tier sets like most shamans. Sure, you'll ignore the off-set healing items and will focus on damage items such as Deep-earth spaulders but you can't really make a full gear from off-set dps pieces until maybe ZG or AQ. So you'll want to roll on T1 and T2 like other shamans, you're just not necessarily targeting the same pieces/same set bonus. IIRC for Ele 5/8 T1 with 3/8 T2 is pretty good, while Resto shamans usually want the full set bonus or stack +healing off-set pieces. Might be wrong but I think some tier pieces only have +healing while some others have +damage and healing, you want to pay attention to that ofc.
---
Omg I used to do this exact same thing but at the Tavern in Crossroads. Something about the barrens, maybe it’s the water?
---
Nahhhh, thats some Alliance shit.. Lol
---
You can play Ret-Pally, Moonkin and Shadowpriest and find a Raiding-Guild... its really not that hard. You can clear MC and BWL with way less than 40 people and even most of AQ doesn't require 40 hardcore raiders with a perfect build.
---
That's alright, though.  Not everyone is going to be ok with every change in any evolving game, but that doesn't mean it's bad for most players. A lot of people who kept up with the game wanted scaled leveling to slow down the way they out level content they enjoy.
---
Then I'll give them the benefit of a doubt if they have not given me a reason to distrust them.
---
This is a very good and very core argument being made. I believe in Classic WoW and know myself, and others are bringing new people to play it - which in turn will bring new people to play it. Then news will spread and guess what, new people will play it.   
---
There is an estimated as many subscriber numbers for Retail WoW worldwide, as there were for Vanilla WoW back in 2005 North America alone. I could easily see a renaissance return to WoW and Classic having as much active player base as retail. Blizzard will be very confused and in shock if that happens.
---
I'm looking forward to all of it.
---
How can you be warned about that when character creation opens up 2 weeks ahead of launch?  Server size is about concurrent players, not total characters.
---
Balance isn't a good thing either. It's better game design for classes to be completely unique and play very differently from each other, than for all classes and specs to be equal in power.
---
People don't quit because of a queue, especially if they just paid for a sub.  Queues are generally extremely temporary.  Also, they could always just *gasp* join a medium or low pop server if it's that important to them... Which it likely isn't.
---
Ultimately, I want this game to succeed and I think that sensationalized view points from either side can be damaging to people's ideas of a games health. My favourite mmo of all time died because people complained about things that weren't necessarily an issue to everybody and that resulted in the "dead game" meme which snowballed and caused people to quit because they thought they were wasting their time.  I truly dont understand why people like to say games are dead on arrival, I think most mmo players are desperate for a new game to sink their teeth into but I feel like the overly demanding player base is what's keeping that from happening.
---
Ya, that's what I thought. Thanks!
---
sm/ruin is solid for both pvp and pve raids/dungeons.
---
Totems can be addressed fairly easy with pet attack macros and wotf is a 2minute cd.  So it depends, in a 1v1 duel yeah those can be really hurtful if they are used at the wrong moments.  But in organized pvp?  Alliance warlocks have paladins, which is an extra dispell class (horde will only have priest) and also pallies are great pvp healers with their buffs and heal crits and bubbles.  This actually makes horde warlocks slightly worse in group pvp because there is more of a chance that their dots get dispelled, and that the fears get regularly dispelled.  It will obviously rely on your group being decent enough to get that shit done, but if playing optimally then the alliance warlock actually has the advantage (in my opinion).
---
You should consider playing on Latin America servers. Though Blizz will not host a server for Spain alone, there will be at least one server for LA for sure (there are **thousands** of players down here). Ping won't be as low, but it might give you a good chance to further practice Spanish by directly interacting with the playerbase.
---
How are you spec'd?
---
Why no immolate?
---
Are you doing 1 mob at a time?
---
Is your wand lvl appropriate?
---
I’ll give it a try I guess thanks
---
Simple answer: don't go as a low level.  I didn't go to STV until 34 last time I leveled at it's much more pleasant.  In fact.. generally speaking try to be slightly overleveled everywhere you go.  Makes leveling much more pleasant..
---
yeah it's so big that you'll have issues going through some doors so it might be handy to have Noggenfogger elixirs with you
---
This build is very strong in PvP. Some suggestions I’d make is to get 2/2 pathfinding for faster cheetah. I find myself toggling cheetah a lot in PvP.  Also I’m a fan of humanoid slaying 3/3, for 3% more damage in PvP.
---
Avid multiboxer here.  My team will be Warrior, Mage, Lock, Rogue, and either Shaman or Paladin depending on if my wife forces us Alliance.
---
Swapping Bear for Prot and Fury for rogue is the better combo, but my wife has currently agreed to be the healer, so I can handle the added complexity of Prot vs. Bear.
---
I use ISBoxer to broadcast keystokes.  I have macros for everything, and use what’s called a leaderless, focusless System.  In other words, no matter the screen I am on, I can “take control” of the whole team in a button press.  “F” makes them all follow the active screen.  With interact with target on, tilde makes the melee run in.  I use 2 for single target spam.  1 is for Rogue’s Slice and Dice (eviscerate is handles via 2 using Gnomish Sequencer Enhanced addon).  3 is global debuff (Demo shout, curse, etc).  4 is follow the tank and cast your AOE @player macro.  5-0 are other utilities (taunt, sheep, blind, seduce, banish, Frost Nova).  - and = have to do with mounting situations.  r, t, y, g, h, z and all F keys are for warrior stuff.  When I also heal, that is all bound to mouseclicks (left, right, middle, m4, m5, and the shift/alt/ctrl combos).
---
Multiboxing Classic will be easier than live due to the generally simpler rotations and fewer requirements for disparate movement.  The number one reason I die on live is when everyone needs to run a different direction.  That is much less common in Classic.
---
My raiding main will likely be the Warrior, though I can very easily duo the Mage and Lock in raids.  If my wife decides to be the Rogue, taking a healer and two casters in a raid would be no sweat.
---
I mean most players have given up on the game. So all together the changes weren't good for most players.
---
so naive trust it is.
---
Layering is less temporary than the problems it "solves".
---
If you're playing with friends that are willing to help send you greens in exchange for enchants, it's not too bad to level. But if you're solo leveling it, it's definitely a money sink especially in the idea you won't be vendoring/AHing the greens/blues for gold. However, not needing to pay for a 40 mount helps a ton.
---
Yup. all i want to do is play classic, i cant get hyped for anything. I was gonna play Borderlands 3 until i saw its release date, so that's out.
---
I recently got South Park the fractured but whole (played stick of truth already) and thoroughly enjoying it more than expected.
---
But ill have that done soon.... then... what?
---
Ever heard of a Rogue ability called Feint? Or Vanish? You can go balls deep with DPS and instantly drop all the Threat you built up.
---
No Alliance Rogue is capable of as much potential maximum DPS than an orc.
---
NE Hunter because of T-armor looks and animations. Think it will be male
---
Do you always timestamp these? I really appreciate it with how long they are.
---
&gt;may the eternal sun shine upon you.
---
most hearth touching monologue I ever heard(read). You convinced me, I hope we will meet on the battlefield my friend.
---
Hey, I plan on playing a Troll Priest in Classic. I’m 36 myself and formerly played Classic, BC and WotLK before bowing out in Cata. I’m looking for a guild to level with and ideally would like to do some instances and raiding. I can promise to be a competent healer when I am online but can’t promise to be online for raid dates or anything. I’m planning to go hard levelling at launch if possible though. If this sounds like a fit, let me know.
---
Probably engineering and alchemy; however, will be hard to farm for mats.
---
In legion I shifted to cat form and laid down in the dalaran inn (horde).
---
It's only your pleb brain that thinks it's selfish. Logical non plebs can easily see it's just a fair distribution of loot that doesn't allow selfishness to make it an unfair distribution of loot.  You're so concerned with how you've been socialized you disregard logic.  If you lived in the 1800s you'd have have been racist as fuck to black people because everyone else was and you're too simple to do anything except what everyone else does.
---
it isn't necessary for the tank to be the leader. the person that knows the dungeon should be the leader imo but it's usually the guy that organised the group.
---
There is a handfull of quality blizzlike vanilla servers with populations big as retail classic servers. ONE of them is shutting down.
---
Not true.  A warlock will go after every rogue.
---
If I can see the rogue then I want to target it prior to it stealthing.  
---
The opening stun for a rogue is what gets us.
---
Naturally the horde would destroy sacred forests to built shitty primitive mud huts.
---
Easiest way to explain it is that BoEs are effectively currency.
---
The only problem with arms in BC was there was only room for one in the raid if your group cared about maximizing DPS.  And you weren't being brought for your individual DPS, but for your debuff on the boss buffing melee damage by 4%.  So really, if your raid was more caster heavy, arms wasn't worth bringing in the first place.
---
That's my only gripe with 25 man raids.  While I love how much easier it is to coordinate and arrange for 25 people to log in at the same time than 40, I hated not being able to being all the supporter specs like arms, survival, elemental, enhance, etc.
---
For example, we had an arms warriors, enhance shaman, and survival hunter, but only because we had enough melee to make it worth it, but we didn't really have room for an ele shaman to buff our caster group, we had one that raided sometimes, but it wasn't ideal from a maximum raid DPS standpoint.

Three points left which you can put into Frost Channeling, Imp CoC, Imp Blizzard or Permafrost depending on what you think you need the most.
---
4 hours a day is perfectly fine for dungeons and you would have a lot of fun experiencing all the content from 1 - 60.  You would be able to run 3 or 4 level 60 dungeons a night for months while you put together your pre-raiding best-in-slot gear.  Eventually, you'll transition into spending those hours in battlegrounds and pvp'ing.  Raiding is a different beast though.  You would have a hard time finding a guild that would accept you into a raid with such a low play time b/c raiding requires a lot of outside work farming consumables, gold for repairs, etc.  You would most likely be added as a "social member" and allowed to raid as a filler or during their split runs.  You'd basically be getting leftovers that no one needed.
---
Don't forget the depends!
---
I know Blizzard doesn’t care about multiboxing, but isn’t third party input software banned under their tos?  So pushing one button and having it work multiple toons wouldnt work right?  Or do they not care because you are paying multiple paid subs?
---
If you want to min/max, orc is by far the better race to pick for PvP. However, realize you'll be playing this game a ton and that character will be on your screen every day. QoL things do exist if models actually matter to you. If you hate the look of orcs, you'll probably hate seeing it on your screen daily.

The last part of your post really rings true, in the ARMY we have this saying of "Choose your hill to die on" when it comes to challenging the status quo; if youre a DPS and this instance is for EXP / quests a lot of time you are better off just shutting up and going with the flow.
---
Who hurt you.
---
I ran the numbers yesterday because I also have been struggling to decide for my rogue. BF will give you a +52AP boost for 15sec every 2 min, so it is a decent racial for PVE along with the stun resist for certain raid mobs. I myself am going Undead
---
Nice site, thanks for mentioning.

You lose the tankiness of soul link, but I think the damage is better with Ruin. I think the DS/ruin spec has higher dps with sacrificing your succubus, but you lose survivability since you're reliant on sacrificing for the extra shadow damage, whereas SM ruin is flat increase to shadow dmg. The link I posted has a few points that i just threw in for extra pvp utility, I'm sure a more experienced warlock will have something to say against it.
---
First of all stop making ridiculous assumptions because it makes you look completely retarded.
---
Firstly I actually don't care at all whether a group wants to run with any arbitrary loot rule, if there's a group for a dungeon I like I will go with whatever the consensus is.
---
Second it should **always** be established in group formation what the rules will be. You make a massive dickfaced assumption that I hide my loot intentions then ninja roll need. No. Fuck off with that shit, it's just undermining your points.
---
Third, if you join a group that states loot rule is X and you get mad because you wanted loot rule Y, that's entirely your problem.
---
Fourth regarding dictating rules, as established that's you're stupid assumption, but also right back at you. Who are *you* to tell *me* that I have to abide by your *entirely arbitrary* rule that goes against the rules dictated by the game itself? If they didn't want me a warlock to need a plate boe, why does the game allow me to? So we're both here saying "I like rule X" l "I like rule Y" opinions differ. Same as reserving a particular item. If you don't like it, join or form a different group. Nobody is forcing you.
---
Fith and finally, no it is *not* ninja looting to roll need on a BOE of when the group was formed it was established that you roll need on BOE. Keep arguing to yourself if you want, you just make yourself more ridiculous..
---
So yeah.. establish the rules when the group is made, and dont invite or join those who have different opinions. Problem is non existent to anyone with a functional brain.
---
Sorry, I replied to my earlier comment instead of yours.
---
True, if the queue is long enough. But will they want to go from Full to low? I think that's a big issue, as in my experience people didn't want to take the free transfer to a dead server. They'd rather reroll onto a slightly less populated High pop server.
---
o_O
---
Aww damn okay seems not worth it but thanks so much for the info I’ll just save the three days for the stress test
---
&gt; No it’s not. I saw the above post. 
---
I didn't post anything about how to pronounce "Kris", you moron.
---
&gt; My point is you don’t have a clue. 
---
[Ser-pen-tine](https://www.google.co.uk/search?source=hp&amp;ei=DQ4mXemqJYm8gwf-iaHwDQ&amp;q=serpentine+pronunciation)
---
The English pronunciation of the English language is always the correct one. Yank mispronunciations are no more correct than someone from Quebec mispronouncing a French word.
---
😂
---
That makes a ton of sense. Thanks for the info man! Sounds like I’ll be fine for both specs since there’s a decent amount of overlap. 
---
I just want some decent gear. A disc priest friend for the 20% dmg buff and some on use SP trinkets to nuke people. Be frickin hilarious in AV 😂.
---
False.
---
I don't mind people repeating questions. What drives me crazy is when they put it *in the title* that they are repeating something.
---
*Another boring x post*.
---
*Yet another post about x*.
---
Like, if you KNOW that you're reposting something, why even do it? Go look at those threads you're referring to.
---
Yeah you're right, and it's annoying that the top fraction is what dictates the meta. A spec can do 5% less damage and be deemed NOT VIABLE, UNINVITABLE. I intend to main a suboptimal PvP spec rogue and am expecting weekly invite rejections because WTF DAGGERS??? Despite doing perfectly adequate dps right up to AQ.
---
I'm sure many a casual raid guild could really benefit from a well played druid offtank for exactly the reasons you suggested. Especially in fights that need more than 2 tanks, which people seem to have forgotten about. Having a flexible druid that can just drop out of cat to deal with something is just a godsend on some fights.
---
Props to you for sticking to your guns and just playing what you enjoy. Too many people are bringing their baggage from retail back with them lol.
---
Because it's not *if* they merge, they're *going* to merge, even if they push layering until world bosses. You can still join guilds, join groups, raid, do dungeons, pvp, and trade all cross-layer. It would be way worse to make layers independent, then **maybe** merge them later and deal with the issues that come up with merging servers.
---
OK, don't log in until Azuregoose is loose.  That way, The millions and millions of players can experience the game at launch with layering.  You can experience wow classic with a fraction of the remaining players in a popular world out layering and a return to one cohesive world.
---
Well sounds good... but we are rolling alliance this time around so if the troll is not a set choice send me a message
---
They’ve said so long as 1 keypress = 1 keypress per client it isn’t an issue.
---
Human is very nice. If I remember correctly, most of the good end game weapons for warriors are swords. Fewer misses means more rage and aggro, so you can't go wrong with that!
---
Ehh a 20 min DMN, and a songflower, and DMF 1-2 times a month rly isn't that tedious. Remember that the city world buffs are on a timer so guilds won't likly be on the CD correctly. Even then it only ever took our guild like 15 min, exept those who cleared DMN, to get our world buffs and go.
---
Do both and buy herbs with the money you make from enchanting or grinding later.  Alchemy transmutes are very profitable and enchants can be as well.
---
Honestly from an unbiased man that you do not know. Between human and orc for warlock, orc wins. You’re pet does a little more dmg (PVP), you have a 30% chance to resist stuns, you have a rage buff that increases your spell power. Not to mention green Jesus. And I’m not even playing horde this time around. Do what you want, but brother between orc and human warlock. Orc is way better.
---
&gt;  no mounts to buy
---
So I take it you've never leveled an alt before?
---
Not sure on Tauren or Night Elf Druid still. 
---
Tauren Warstomp is probably more useful in terms of racials, and you dont face shamans which seem like theyd be very annoying to deal with. 
---
On the other hand, Night Elves dont compete with shamans for stuff and have better synergies from Paladins. Also I prefer NE animal forms and their mounts.
---
Fair point! I just more so meant that if a Warlock HAD to choose between Orc and UD, it'd probably choose the Orc.
---
There's no downside that I can think of. You'll probably die a few times trying to run through Mulgore and the Barrens at lvl 1, but you'll also get some exploration xp on the way.
---
If you meet up (in Mulgore or Valley of Trials) at level 1, you'll have to wait about 30 minutes of traveling to play together.
---
If you meet up at level 10-12 in Crossroads, you'll be playing separately for something like 2-4 hours before meeting up.
---
It's not a big deal either way.
---
It would be a slightly bigger deal if one of you played a class that didn't have class trainers in the starting zone, but Warrior+Shaman should be fine.
---
For The Horde!
---
No your not lol.   Not in my leveling “rested” xp days lol
---
Not everyone believes that, but ya it makes sense that if Blizzard is considering opening more servers near Launch if needed, even with layering, then it makes sense that layers per server will have some sort of limit. I would imagine that servers that get the brunt of the rush will have some layers, and a queue as well.
---
Scatter and trap being on same diminish returns makes hunter a no go for me.
---
This!  What a joke.
---
S4 arp was frustrating when rogue / rogue would come at you.  Especially when one of em had a warglaive set
---
If you see "not distrusting everyone" as naive, then yes. It's definitely better than being cynical.
---
Why?
---
100% minmaxed it is engr and blacksmithing.  Engr for grenades, net, reflectors, rocket boots, rocket helm, etc.  Blacksmithing gives you the glimmering mythril insignia that gives you 30sec of fear immunity.  It is good, but not great and with engr you often have better trinket options, so far more typical is engr + some gathering profession or enchanting.
---
So, you create a character early on Realm Y-1.  Turns out streamer x is also rolling on Y-1 but that isn't revealed until the game goes live.  Not wanting to deal with that, you move over to Realm Z-1, listed as low pop.  "Great," you think to yourself, "No worries about having to deal with any bullshit to play!"
---
Except 10k other people had the same idea after you, and now you're stuck on a "server" that will have a big queue next time you log in.  No way to warn for that, either, is there?  What then, they should just go reroll on ANOTHER server to avoid the queue after you already got to level 10 or 15 or 20?

Thats a pretty average quality post.
---
Alone the fact to suggest to heal 60 dungeons without illumination makes it rather bad.
---
Also you want to have „some“ Defense otherwise you’re squishy af.
---
You won’t be perfect as pally hybrid but in my opinion the best middle ground for the OPs purpose will be the 25/26/0 build.
---
Get illumination
---
Get reckoning
---
Get Blessing of Sanctuary
---
For myself I will start with 20/31/0 getting decent tanking gear and go for the above build when gear gets better.
---
And OP don’t forget to AoE Grind early. It’s fun for the last levels and nets a decent amount of gold at the right spots.
---
Rank1 baiting still works if you notice they're cleansing blindly.  Hard to do while you're beating eaten alive by melee and ttk is so fast before resi but it helps when trying to oom aome overgeared paladin bastard at an ab flag or something .

---
There’s a great book that covers increasing difficult called something like “your body is your barbell”. Very helpful and you don’t need any gear.
---
&gt;If you're forced to choose a layer at character creation, there will be dead layers from day one.
---
With server clusters they would be actively funnelling players into low pop servers as much as possible.  Also, you can't have it both ways.  Overpopulation can't be the worst thing ever and dead servers still be abundant.
---
Streamers are a very big problem in regards to overpopulation and queues, I agree 100%, but we can't bend the entire game around them.
---
&gt;This means there will be less people to choose Y-2 through Y-5 because you can't move between them
---
The beauty of this is you can merge them literally the day after launch if need be.  They share name pools.  The infrastructure to merge should be pre-existing.  The only annoying issue is merging the Auction Houses, but that's about as minor of an inconvenience you can have.
---
&gt;If you dynamically add another layer when the previous gets "full"
---
You would not wait until that server was full.  Blizzard would have to be very active in making sure this was done properly.  But like I said, if you get 100 people on a server and it doesn't seem to be growing, just merge it with another in the group.
---
I am gonna be milking the leveling content and not by choice.
---
It will probably be '"Easier" to clear this time around, the majority of the players are older than when classic was originally released and also we had a lot of time to play wow, including servers, in the meantime. Therefore, people will be able to play "better". The timing of TBC was bad, it didn't give enough time to people to clear Nax.
---
I think playing is going to even itself out again, so we are going to have very similar results as original classic.
---
Ah those times when some of you are waiting at the dungeon and it turns out the others were still questing because they thought their was a lock in the group or thought mages could summon.
---
I remember my guild had a policy that those at the raid entrance got priority(unless they were doing something for the guild, ect...).
---
Honestly I think not running back after wipes wasted more time in the long run.  No mass rez meant waiting on individual rezzes which cost a large chunk of healer mana so you'd then have to wait on regen of both the healer and the rezzed.
---
Off putting in what sense?
---
You never had beta access. So no you can’t join.
---
Priest is very good 1v1 both as shadow and in healing builds.  As a healer just expect it to take you several minutes to kill someone.  
---
Priest stuggles more from getting zerged.  I mean every class sucks if you are outnumbered, but priest lacks escape and slow kill time as a healer increases the chances of other people joining the fight.  In group fights if the enemy team does not focus you down or control you, your support is so significant that your team will likely win.  So expect to be targeted first in group fights.
---
Right, which is why I dont agree with doing it that way and think the open migrations blizzard chose were the best option and should be done again instead if layering to keep things blizzlike
---
The best rogue I knew back then was a troll lol.
---
I'd suggest waiting to meet up until level 12-15 at the Crossroads.  You'll both end up there anyway and it only take a few hours to get to that point.
---
Yeah, but in 40 man vanilla raids many classes were outright unplayable, not to mention many people couldn’t use all their abilities due to the extremely low debuff limit as well as the threat management issues.
---
TBC had 2.5x as many debuffs with less than 2/3 the number of raiders. The combination of viable specs available and the fact that a large chunk of the raid wasn’t just relegated to frost / shadowbolt spamming was a large reason I enjoyed TBC raiding more.
---
Wtf? This is really so well done!
---
I had this saved as I can't open it on mobile, but definitely didn't expect to see so much effort put into this! Amazing.
---
Imp Gouge is super necessary. The most necessary of all probably.
---
Ok cool, sounds good to me. Thanks
---
You clearly did not read what I said, because I said absolutely nothing about it being related to characters created. Read again.
---
~~Office LAN parties~~ Boardroom meetings indeed!
---
Its amazing how many time people ask, lol
---
How can you tell? I don't doubt you, just curious.
---
Memory could be playing tricks watching my friend play FF11.  Do you portal out of the Dunes in FF11 or do you walk to the next zone?  IIRC you have basically a "Wailing Caverns instance" for each zone in the game and so it would not be like some one in barrens waving or trying to trade with someone standing in the next zone of durotar.  It was like GW where you portal to everything and everything part of the game is load balanced and a fragmented experience.
---
If the person really needed the item they would have already bought it on the auction house. Similarly, another person in the group might need a different boe and can use the gold from selling it to get that item.
---
Yeah I tended to get home right before raids so I had most of them done abd just logged outsude tbe instance when possible.
---
I think not running back after wipes.  Just shows a disrespect for everyone else's time since everyone else has to wait for you to be rezzed then for you and the healer to regen Health/mana.
---
I feel like this is going to be a worse problem in classic since everyone is used to mass rez :(
---
Beta is invite only. There will be a public stress test July 18-19.
---
That did happen but I don't think batching is responsible unless the moment at which the server registers you as no longer casting is also batched, which I highly doubt. To begin with if you have 150ms of lag then you can be interrupted for 150ms after moving. With the internet speeds of many people back then this was easily feasible. I think for its time the net code wasn't bad (although certainly not amazing either), you just fundamentally get more responsive than however fast your connection is.
---
&gt;They even scaled the level of mobs? Just completely taking away the RPG feel of exploration and the open world.
---
That was actually an effort to *increase* exploration of the world, because until then all people did was power level in dungeon queue.  Outside in the world you could do a zone, and completely outlevel it before you even finished with the story in that zone, so they introduced scaling in an effort to allow the player some agency in which quests/story/zones they wanted to pursue.
---
I think it was a good solution for the particular problem, but it doesnt really address dungeon spam to be honest.
---
I was planning to just play BFA 8.2 for a couple of hours, but when the install classic popped out, that desire vanished instantly. 
---
I feel Bliz are trolling me
---
Hmm you might be right. Still orcs are better locks
---
At launch? No one was talking about at launch, this entire thread is about queues in Phase 2. You seem to have a reoccurring problem with serious reading comprehension issues, this is the 2nd time you have replied to me talking about something that has absolutely NOTHING to do with what I said.
---
You get more than enough defence from dungeon gear. Even without the defence talent I maybe get redoubt proc once every couple of trash pulls. Threat generated comes from block so boosting your defence any higher hurts your threat and therefore dungeon speed. 
---
Illumination is only necessary for dungeon healing if the tank or group is undergeared. With proper downranking mana management really shouldn’t be an issue in 5 mans.
---
In general seal of command is really nice simply because rank 1 does the same amount of damage as max rank (ignoring judgment). so dispels lose to you if they try to spam dispel.
---
Every time you don't resist a stun or face against a class without access to stuns it's a dead racial. Consider that, while less likely to happen playing an orc, it's still entirely possible to get dunked on by rogues without ever resisting a stun.
---
Not the undermine how powerful it can be, but it's something that triggers at random. On the flip side, as a tauren you get to impose one of those nasty stuns on someone *at will*. It's more powerful than it appears on paper.
---
Play what you think is cool. My first 60 was a tauren warrior and I had a blast.
---
what do you mean by that?
---
You would almost always be invited as filler dps.  Warriors are way too gear dependent.  If you somehow managed to get all the raiding tank gear, then you'd be asked to tank.  But dungeon blues?  Raid leftovers?  Odds are, you are always going to be dps.
---
I was told by the 'friend' who introduced me to wow all those years ago that you get "more xp when you rest in a bed".......I thought that is what got you the rested xp bonus.
---
Took me weeks to realize and figure it out ffs
---
Especially on Moonguard.
---
Heresy!
---
Elemental shaman does kind of rely on cooldowns for burst though, either EM or NS. Not required but if you really want to blow someone up you'll want one of those cooldowns. Especially since you can get off a chain lightning AND an earthshock crit with EM if you spam it.
---
No
---
One thing thats funny, is that hunter was clearly the last/least designed class on vanilla launch.  They had more bugs and more glaring issues on vanilla launch then they do on classic, and despite those issues they were a dominating class early in the game.  
---
I am not saying this is the case, but it is almost like they lathered on base-non scaling damage(quivers and alot of your dps coming from ammo) into hunter to compensate for some of the early deficiencies.
---
How do you know it's not from Classic? I'm not doubting it's from a private server but, as far as I can see, OP hasn't said anything to that effect. Is there some giveaway I'm missing?
---
Had the expect same reaction at the mention of def cap. @Leviison defense is a worthless stat, just use shield block n you're good.
---
Being dodged, parried, miss, then get crited and die. They are a very rewarding class to master and overcome on the way to 60. But while leveling, esp 1-40 you are going to die to some stupid shit.
---
I will, but first tell me which zone/city is this
---
I legit don't understand what you're saying. How does layering put people in queues longer than 10 hours?
---
Two rogues? Corruption on ud, fear the orc, faps, nuke ud until it dies, and then refear orc to set up shadowbolt/immolation/conflag/deathcoil
---
Related story: I was running UBRS back in Vanilla farming the [Felstriker](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=12590) because what dagger rogue didn't want that back in the day? The group I'm in is good and clearing the dungeon, fast. All of a sudden the [Scarlet Kris](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5267) drops, and so does my jaw. For weeks my broke ass has been seeing this thing on the auction house wishing someone would sell it for a price I could afford to no avail, and here it is finally in my grasp.....except not. Literally every group member (I forget if we had 10 or 15 in the group) needed on it, and a mage won.. 
---
I hit all the stages of grief. Denial: OMG I can't believe I lost that roll. Depression: man this SUUUUUUCKS.  Bargaining: PLEASE, that's a HUGE upgrade for me, can I buy it for a discount. You know, it's really not fair that you should have it, since it is an upgrade for me, this might as well be a ninja. To finally Anger: FUCK YOU ALL (because everyone but me thought I should get it) and Isolation: (hearths to Org). 
---
I don't think I ever got to "Acceptance".......Funny thing is though the I would leave the first major raiding guild I was in to join another better raiding guild of which the mage who "took" the Scarlet Kris from me was in, and he was an officer. Luckily he didn't remember me, and we (after I got over the situation) hit it off and went undefeated as a mage/rogue combo in patch 2.0 when Arena's were made available. 
---
To actually answer your question though (sorry for going on that tangent) I personally think that everything should be greeded unless it's an actual upgrade for you. Of course, not everyone rolls that way and if you feel strongly enough about it then that should be something you discuss with the party before you actually commit to doing the dungeon to make sure everyone is on the same page.
---
Kargoz was testing 2 warriors, 2 rogues, enhancement Shaman. I think it was yesterday. He also tested spell cleave.
---
WoW Classic, TBC, nor WotLK, were never about racing to 60. That's just retail WoW.
---
forsenDED V E R W A T C H
---
You win... I haven't played this game in far too many years to remember that 🤣
---
Ebbnflow the druid YouTuber has a video on this.
---
You should really go watch Restoring history: creating wow classic. I guess the title already say alot huh? 
---
They only have data for patch 1.12 so that is the only version they with confident can restore.
---
It shouldn’t have begun with anything because a standing desk is negligible difference if you’re already getting up to work out every once in a while.  Being stationary is the big problem, and a standing desk doesn’t fix that, it just shifts issues to your legs.
---
Fair, what if I have a priest accompanying me on the journey to 60? I’m sure that would help my sustainability and hopefully not die quite as much?
---
I had a night elf mount as a gnome in vanilla.  It is a very long and expensive grind.  I spent a few weeks farming runecloth for hours every day in Felwood/Winterspring, if I recall correctly.
---
Not really. You’ve installed the game, not the beta. 
---
Beta is a different client to the release version of the game.
---
i really hope this becomes a thing! i love reading about the history of old realms on wowwiki
---
It's also 25% not 30 for stun resist. But yes for 1v1 PvP orc is vastly superior.
---
It isn't a worthless stat. It is often a very good stat actually. But focusing on hitting that def cap is a fool's errand, especially with 1.12 itemization many defense values on items are nerfed. Prebis lists that seem to blindly go for high defense items without considering alternatives should be avoided.
---
Your home is where your heart belongs. As for Horde it is lvl 60 Hunter Gankjaman's lootbag.
---
Honestly you can pvp just find with combat swords, riposte/parry/imp sprint mixed in with the rest of combat makes you prettt strong. Makes pve super easy too
---
Help, i have alt-itis.  
---
I am having a big issue deciding what to play with classic.  
---
In retail vanilla i played a warrior (Naxx cleared) and a Priest (aq40 cleared, 11/15 naxx).   
---
I've played on several other servers and have decided a few things
---
1) Still going horde, Lok'tar Ogar for life
---
2) I am just bad at playing a mage or a lock
---
3) I'd like to be group/raid friendly
---
4) I will have at least 1 other 60 for pvp/farming if i am playing a healer or tank or my main.
---
5) I really enjoy tanking and healing
---
Warriors:  I love my original warrior, but tank warriors are a beast and a half to fund and farm with.  If i went this way i'd have to have 2nd character for open world farming/pvp.  I could go dps warrior.  
---
Rogue:  I like the play style and the pvp power.  For raiding its going to be in the same spot as the dps warrior
---
Priest/Shaman: Everyone loves a healer and i've played both (priest in vanilla, shaman in tbc and wotlk).  Both have good pvp or pve specs and raid/group invites should be pretty easy.  Would have to have 2nd character to farm
---
Druid:  I'm loving the druid i'm leveling right now and there seems to be a good indication that bear tanking and power shift dps are both viable, so this could give me a chance to be either healer or dps.  And either spec would also be viable for pvp, pve, and farming.
---
Hunter:  Good pvp, good initial phase dps, excellent farmer, a half blind monkey can level one.  
---
So here is where i currently am.  
---
Plan A)  
---
Orc Hunter to 60 with skinning/DE.  At 60 drop DE for herbalism 
---
Cow Druid to 60 with skinning/enchanting.  Drop skinning for alchemy and be a bear tank
---
Plan B)  
---
Cow Druid to 60 with skinning/enchanting. Drop skinning for herb and be a bearcat
---
Orc Shaman to 60 with skinning/alch.  Drop skinning for alchemy and go resto at 60
---
Plan C)  
---
Troll Priest to 60 with tailor/alch.  Go holy or holy weaver for raiding.
---
As you can see, i need help
---
&gt;Felwood
---
I hated Felwood with a passion. It always felt a bit cramped and I just remember not waiting to be able to do all the quests and leave.
---
Do you get an unfair share of loot, because of your COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY loot rule changes?  Yes.   Then you are stealing loot, and are therefore a ninja looter.
---
You are a ninja.  
---
Sorry, but them's the facts.
---
I never played on a pserver.  Most of this stuff was common knowledge in vanilla.
---
Aesthetics is never a bad reason to pick a race.  Even if you do serious pvp.  There is always an advantage to everything, and a trade-off.
---
It’s 30%. All races have a default 5% chance to resist. Orcs have 30% overall.
---
Or is prevented by the cast.
---
I once did a similar thing:  
---
Sort of like a roleplay by myself where I make the camera zoom so it looks like 1st person, Alt+Z to hide the UI, switch to walk and start on the 2nd floor in Lion's Pride inn and RP how my character wakes up at the inn and slowly leaves and goes on his adventure. xD
---
Melee did much better than they were supposed to, and it’s all because of leeway.
---
I always made sure to sleep in the inn when I was done playing for the day. I really liked the inn in Kharanos and Ironforge, they felt so warm and cozy
---
The worst part of totems is having to redrop them based on their initial short range.  Most raid fights don't move much so once you find the best place to drop them you are fine.  
---
Never elemental in raid, they oom and do subpar damage.  In addition nature damage is tied for the worst class of damage in a raid environment as there is no curse of nature and it is missing a secondary buff like weaving, winter's chill, or imp scorch.
---
What blizzard should have done, *from day 1*, was make need rolls automatically BoP. I mean, if you actually need it, then you have no reason to give it to anybody else, right?
---
I'll never understand why blizzard didn't do this.
---
Fair point; I don't recall tons of people having Engineering back in Vanilla myself due to the sheer cost, but I could be remembering wrong.
---
Ah well, I'll have a decision made by launch hopefully!
---
I've done this, but it only works if you change it at the very last instant. It doesn't always work either. That was in Vanilla, and it might not work at all in classic.
---
Copy. I didn’t watch the stream. I was thinking, one of the best spots to do this would be SM Arm, which is really handy if you want to bring 4 warriors and a Shaman and do 20 minute runs. You could leave with everyone fully geared out.
---
Knew a kid that would do pushups or squats during flight. Literally anything other than alt+tab and more doing nothing will improve your life. Not sure how you can go to the gym during a corpse run, so that isnt classic related, but the gist of doing ANYTHING during the considerable down time that is classic is a great idea.
---
Not directly, but you can figure it out. I'm sure people will organize groups to identify layers because it will be very necessary to avoid accidentally grouping with people from other layers.
---
You might not be on "layer 7", but you'll be on the layer that "Rugtug" plays on, for example.
---
I understand you're trying to apply the modern trend of game hoping to a very different beast. You don't understand the point of this thread.
---
What if you interact with the NPC, click "make this inn my home", then wait to hit Accept until after casting Hearth/AR?
---
That counts as interaction I think
---
This is sound advice. To piggyback, mage has GOT to be the easiest DPS to get a group as, even with it's popularity. I would definitely not cry if my group was three mages.
---
Wasn't it Healingstat (Shadowpriest) who won against Snutz in the grand finals?
---
Like be able to gank or hold my own optimally I guess
---
LMAO
---
Yeah make some content about stuff you actually have a clue about instead, this coming from someone whos never played rogue. Also you sound like you are talking to pre-school children sometimes.  
---
Good production value tho.
---
Ok thanks!
---
With a treadmill. Boom.
---
I intend on rolling a warrior with the intent of tanking and PVP’ing, but I can’t decide between Tauren and Orc. Tauren is my favorite race, the extra HP is nice and war stomp is sick for 5-man’s &amp; PVP, but I’m having a hard time passing up that stun resist (and orc is my second favorite race anyways). Someone help me out!
---
Sub just feels really weak leveling but has great utility
---
SoC is better with a weapon slower than 2.4
---
no if you understood it was superior you wouldn't be the big dumb bro.  it simply is superior, inherently and logically.
---
They could have 15 yards of fucking leeway and they would still lose every single 1v1 tournament. Warriors are absolute trash at 1v1 no matter how geared.
---
Wasn't there dynamic respawn in vanilla though? (obviously not at pserver levels but still)
---
I love NE 2h animation. The only one better is Troll males.
---
Look, one of the most memorable gaming moments I had was this Lineage wedding slaughter and I'm all for the good and bad that come with open world PvP and I would rather they let it all fly. I even think same faction griefing is fine.. the giant bears/mounts on mailboxes are the things you remember and just allowing all non-exploits is easier than making constant judgement calls based on... who knows.
---
I'm just saying that streamers do hold some sway and so while, to me, I would love it if they 100% honored what I grew up on.. it could end up a financial/PR decision. They also have a lot more options than what you've outlined here.
---
Streamer layer, implementing a war games like queue, changing PvP rules in a random lowbie zone, changing where duels can take place, maybe an official *event* layer/instance.
---
So what I meant by the equation.. is sure.. doing anything you listed or I listed may hurt the game.. but does it hurt it more than if they don't.  I dunno.
---
Dead serious.
---
UD is better for pvp hands down
---
People are understandably jaded with retail, but it isn't a BAD game. It's still a lot better than most MMOs out there (barring FFXIV and ESO depending on personal taste). It has unquestionably gone backwards in a lot of areas however, which is just tragic considering the solid foundations the early expansions laid.
---
The most inexcusable, is the removal of freedom and the WANT to log in every day and replacing it with monotony and NEED to log in every day.
---
Having said that, questing through the new zones and heroic and mythic raids are nonetheless, still really enjoyable. Its sad that the ENTIRE rest of the game isn't really anymore.
---
They share a sub, there is nothing to fix...
---
You really are talking out of your ass. You have no fucking clue what you're talking about. It doesn't matter that some of them are not from NA, they have all already agreed to roll on the same NA server together. You would know this had you watched any Classic beta streams.
---
Stop arguing when you are clearly in the wrong.
---
We got KJ down and I know we brought mages, and I recall them being helpful on M'uru because the adds p1 were CC able. But I also remember we had mages do specific jobs, like the drakes on the KJ fight. I think it's because we had capable people playing them and they have blink, but maybe it was the lower dps?
---
I wanted to level a warrior for classic but I may do bear just because I can't raid and the bears scale better with weaker gear.
---
Yeah i think ill stick to blizzards argument for why they do as they do, and not some random selfproclaimed vanilla expert who dont even wanna go look into the source material that is provided to him, but keeps rabbling the same nonsense
---
I bounced before legion and no I’ve never been there.
---
Yeah, not knocking their strength by any means, but a lot of strongmen and power lifters seem to use it as an excuse to let their body fat get out of control. They're naturally going to be fattier since their focus is strength &gt; physique, but some just let it go too far.
---
Tranquil Air totem in every DPS group. You can never have too many shaman.
---
So you are going to give up a trinket slot?? lol
---
I'd love to see a simplified guide to be able to pull this off with just a Warrior + Healer duo.
---
I've been curious about experimenting for the thrill of something new and challenging.
---
Literally unplayable
---
&gt; Those aren't layers at that point, they're just different realms. Why should we not be able to interact with everyone on our realm?
---
Ah see now you're getting it. They *are* separate realms, at least from the players' perspective. The entire point of using sharding/layering is to smooth the merging process for Blizzard.
---
You can't talk to people on other realms, right? Then I think the same should apply to layers. This is an MMO. A single cohesive world is the absolute top priority.
---
&gt; Should they limit the number of characters you can have per layer, so when they merge you don't have to delete any?
---
Sure! That's convenient benefit I hadn't even thought about. Each server can have x number of layers, and you can have 10 characters per server, split into the layers however you wish. Again, it makes the merging extremely simple.
---
Alternatively, they could lock your characters to a single layer per server, but I wouldn't care either way.
---
&gt; It's so much easier to abuse that idea of "layering"
---
There's nothing to be abused. Again, from the players' perspective, these layers are effectively independent servers.
---
Hmmm, I do like the sound of that. How is leveling these professions though? I would imagine it's difficult to do this while leveling your character as well since you would have to constantly buy mats at AH while leveling to level up the professions? Or is it best to just get to 60 then focus on the profession leveling?
---
Got postponed to July 25-26
---
You can say that again.  Some behemoths that legit just roll off a couch, walk into the gym and say they are powerlifters. Lol
---
Pretty sure they changed it to a week later.
---
It really does feel like someone at/near the top is nursing a grudge and doing everything they can to sabotage the project while still maintaining plausible deniability. It feels a lot like the various shenanigans Les Moonves pulled over the years to keep Star Trek off the air because he doesn't like sci-fi.
---
Again, I don't have any real evidence in favor of this, just a gut feeling. As you said, corporate politics is a strange business.
---
Weed doesn't grow in caves you pleb! That's where they keep the shrooms...
---
You might be inclined to switch a few times, but honestly I found fury to be pretty solid for leveling.
---
My first max level character in vanilla was a tauren warrior and I took alchemy/herb as professions. With elixirs, potions and first aid I was never in as rough shape as some people make it out to be. I was also dual wielding up until about the mid/late 50s when I got the icy barbed spear, can't remember exactly when I switched, but even then I was still primary in the fury tree. Some people will say it's vastly inferior to 2h, but I hated missing attacks and preferred the slow and steady stream of hits and rage generation to the big swings. 
---
For leveling you want things to be as smooth as possible. Betting on big slow hits can be frustrating when you're fighting tough mobs and you miss a couple times.
---
Ya because I claimed I was a vanilla expert. 
---
&gt;who dont even wanna go look into the source material that is provided to him, but keeps rabbling the same nonsense
---
Ive already listened to their reasons. I'm not arguing against blizzard. That wasn't the point of what I was saying. Go back and re-read my original comment. Or just keep being ignorant. Whatever.
---
If you have enough gear. You can go ham as fury. Is it as good as Arms? No of course not but, Arms is the strongest group pvp spec in the game. Fury though once you get that gear flowing. Can freaking level teams.
---
keep in mind no honor at launch, while there might be some pvp going on in the open world, it won't be near as intense as when you level an alt in phases 2/3+; 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMxcoxZG0EzbVzxfo
---
Work out during lunch at work/school, meal prep on non-raid days, buy gold for $ so you dont have to farm consumables. 
---
Or you could do slippery cheetos-finger pushups while waiting for your hot pockets.
---
Except not everyone needs.   I'd say easily 1/5 of the players won't push need most of the time.  That means you are getting an unfair distribution of loot.   That's loot you stole by unnecessarily changing the loot rules, and therefore you are a ninja looter. 
---
It's quite easy to understand.
---
Compared to the other classes in Vanilla, warrior is definitely the worst leveler. Plenty of other games have grinds that are significantly worse.
---
I asking you to qualify your statement that casters are far stronger.
---
Imagine getting hit by a grenade
---
whether they use layers or more realms or unhoppable layers the number of people that can play is the same.
---
2 realms with 5 layers at 3k player cap = 30k people playing the game.
---
10 realms at 3k player cap = 30k people playing the game.
---
however, when the player cap is lower, the queue kicks in faster and encourages players to pick another realm instead.  
---
people are less encouraged to wait in a 10k queue when the server with a queue only has 3k players, and there are many other servers with 3k players to pick from that might have less queue time. 
---
likewise, people are more likely to feel okay waiting in a 10k queue when the server with a queue has 15k players and the other server doesn't have any because we're all waiting in the queue instead of playing a dead server.
---
People will be busy leveling then farming. Lots of people in zones and groups will limit ganking to a minimum. PvP is very rare on new servers.
---
I aspire for players to say the same about me 15 years from now.
---
Does that talent (Humanoid Slaying) affect PvP targets? I've heard conflicting reports on whether the extra damage does count against player controlled characters or not. Not sure if anyone beta tested that
---
That's not my experience with the addon...  If you add the line /mttv "ability name" on the first line of the macro, it'll make the icon/tooltip show as the ability spelled out on that /mttv line.  That way it also shows the cooldown counts and everything else for that ability.
---
As far as "against the spirit of vanilla" what I mean is that the Macro language/capability was more powerful than what was likely originally intended, which led to the overhaul of the macro system and limits being placed on what could and could not be scripted.  Vanilla was great and certainly being able to spam one hotkey to clean the entire raid of debuffs was cool, but it was certainly more powerful than the devs intended which is why the scope and abilities of macros and addons was changed and made more limited to where a single button press couldn't just automatically do more than one action.
---
As far as that addon goes though, I used it quite a bit for raiding where I had macros that popped trinkets and arcane power, and I was able to display the tooltip/icon on the ability bar and see the cooldown for Arcane Power on the button much like #showtooltip would have done normally.
---
I mean, until AQ40 isn't that just frost?
---
Two out of three examples you have given for spell batching are not even due to spell batching. This is why it's difficult to have any reasonable conversation about spell batching - most people have no idea what it means.
---
Spell batching **DOES NOT** cause missed grenades to land or you to be able to run traps. All spell batching does is it bunches up together all the actions that took place within a certain time window (400ms) and executes them simultaneously. Spell batching only affects _when_ things happen, not whether they happen or not.
---
Nade hits are calculated when your nade cast is finished, not when they land on the ground and explosion happens. This means that if the enemy was within the target rectingle when your cast finished, they will be hit no matter where they move during the time the nade is flying from your hand to the target area. An example of this could be a mage blinking after the nade cast finishes and still getting hit 20 yards away from the nade explosion.
---
The wonky trap running is caused by how the client sends movement packets to the server. In vanilla movement updates had a system in place to minimize the amount of data transmissions between the server and client but without affecting the gameplay too much. As a result of this, running in straight line without adjusting your facing direction (without holding right mouse button) will make movement packets (information regarding your current location) send out to the server only every 500ms. You can notice this in the trap clip, where it's always done by the person running in a straight line (with speed buffs) to not trigger the trap. Essentially the last time the server received the player's position they were behind the trap's triggering radius, and the next time the player was past the radius. As far as the server is concerned, the player never was within the trap's triggering radius. Each player's client just interpolated the movement of the player to go through the trap.
---
Obviously seemingly missed nades landing can also be affected by this movement packet delaying, where the position of the character on server is different to where each client sees it (by up to a 500ms error).
---
Honestly though before people get in outrage about this mechanic (that for some reason nobody talks about) it really is not gonna be a big deal in any capacity come classic. Running through a trap requires very specific starting point in relation to the trap, movement speed buffs, and you to not adjust your path whatsoever. For the most part everybody PVPing hold right mouse button and turn continuously while in combat, which causes interactions like this to be exceedinly rare.
---
Well I guess he got better around tbc then.
---
Combat swords it is thank you :)
---
There's a good chance he's setting himself up for various forms of mental illness when he reaches old age. Been a lot of interesting stuff coming out in regards to sleep studies.
---
Also keep in mind community mods can fill the gap of some features we like from retail like a cloud based group finder.
---
Map overlay for quests, etc.
---
Many mod creators were in the beta getting a feel for the build 👍🏽
---
UC and TB are way, wayyyyyyyy better looking than Org
---
This is a pretty good idea. Whenever I'm serious about getting back into shape I min-max to use every free moment I have to do something slightly active. I should probably get back onto that... on the beta I've just been using my spare time to take care of things I need to like feeding cat, bathroom break, cook food, etc.
---
Hmmm that is a great question my dude.
---
Oo, very nice, I didn't know this was a thing! Thank you for info!!!!
---
Sounds great if you can rely on everyone to follow that rule. That won't happen though, so just make it easy and everyone needs BoEs and if someone really wants it they can negotiate with the winner. Otherwise it just opens up all sorts of doors for people to "need" it then sell it on the AH like anyone else in the party could/would do.
---
I think it's you that doesn't understand it. There's videos out there from people like Perplexity not only outright demonstrating it but also explaining exactly how it works.
---
Unless you have some actual evidence, like these videos. To back up your assertions that you somehow know something they don't, then I'm not defaulting to what you said.
---
DMN is the annoying one, I could care less about the rest. Songflower too to some extent, wastes 15 minutes flying around only for some asshole to click early. But I suspect (hope) raidwide songflower won't be on classic
---
That's from the last stress test which was open to anyone with an active NA sub.
---
People can still download the client for it, but obviously it's not going to connect to anything.
---
You would have got an email for the beta, and they've long since stopped inviting people. (It's also a different client)
---
This was in Sunwell. We literally had 1 mage in our raids because every single other class did significantly more damage or had more survivability with similar (within ~5%) damage.
---
I used to log off like that until I was raped by a gnome.
---
That would be an interaction thus cancelling the cast of the ability/item.
---
They nerfed the scorpid poison that would 5 stack and stay 5 stacked doing like 1k+ damage per tick when buffed.
---
Man...literally the only reason I'm hesitant to roll Hunter is that after rok'delar, you're done with anything but crossbows... Really makes me sad :0
---
They reach 63 iirc and the Enslave demon spell has a very hard time landing and then keeping them under controll in my experience
---
Up the speed every time you lose in world PvP.  And up the volume on "You're The Best, Around"!
---
What I remember from Vanilla live was UBRS could be done without a prot spec. Probably not ideal but doable.
---
Itll be really dead in a few days when its shut down.
---
I know you could reset instances in retail, but I don't remember if it teleported you outside the instance or at your hearth.
---
Keeping siphon life on 3-4 people definitely generates some decent HPS in a Bg when you have gear, but yes, melee on you will suck.
---
If there’s more than one hopefully you have a healer.
---
Once you have aq40+ nax gear as a lock you become unbeatable with soul link lol
---
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4591921/
---
There are bad health outcomes for standing too much also.  It isn’t standing or sitting that is the real problem, it’s the sedentary lifestyle.   Everything in moderation.
---
If it's the class you want to play most, you'll be disappointed when they fix the bugs and you're playing something else.
---
Leave her alone and if she likes it without feeding off of your excitement, then you've got a winner.
---
if they don't roll need thats their problem lol....  they can easily solve their problem by just clicking the other button.  super dumb bro
---
Couple looking for Semi-Hardcore Guild that will be doing both PvP instances and PvE Raids
---
TLDR: Feral (Ideally Tank) Druid and TBD Mage (Druid player has experience raiding as healer/dps/tank and Mage player with minimal WoW experience), Horde Side, Semi-Hardcore, AST (hour ahead of EST) Timezone
---
ME:
---
- male, Canadian, 32 years old
---
- Tauren Feral druid, looking to OT as bear, but happy enough as cat DPS
---
- Played from Vanilla to WotLK, took a break and played a week of Cata
---
- Raided as follows:
---
 Vanilla - Healer then DPS around patch 1.10+ (MC, Ony, BWL, ZG, AQ20, most of AQ40)
---
 TBC - MT/OT and occasionally dps (all)
---
 WotLK - OT and DPS (First few, names escape me atm)
---
- Raid leading, loot council, officer of a few guilds
---
- Willing to take up more responsbility
---
HER:
---
- female, Canadian, 33 years old
---
- Troll or Undead Mage, spec TBC
---
- A month or two on a private server to see if she wanted to play Classic.
---
- 8 months of SWTOR (at launch), cleared most of the first raid or two
---
BOTH OF US:
---
- Days available for raiding (but doesn't mean raiding every single one of those days) - Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday
---
- Times available for raiding - 6 or 7pm to 9 or 10pm, Saturday does not have the same end time restriction
---
- 2 to 3 raids a week
---
- PvP Server with an interest in doing organized PvP (WSG, AB, AV, etc) alongside PvE content
---
- pvp server preferred, but willing to change our minds for a good offer
---
Any questions or interests let me know and I'll try to answer them for you
---
Arinoth &amp; Feyara
---
How can you change to a completely different playstyle as a hunter? That was the very thing that made me not chose them, all their specs pretty much play the same at the end of the day.
---
Exactly. Make it easy on everyone and just let everyone need all BoEs. It's not that hard. Trying to hold randoms up to some arbitrary standard of ethics is an easy way to have a bad time.
---
Looks like your only solution is to roll shaman.
---
&gt;If I hear there's a big SS v TM battle, and I fly in to TM to join the fray, and no one's there because the fight is on a different layer, that's a problem.
---
I mean you can just ask for an invite to the layer with the battle.
---
&gt;If I'm LFG to defeat a rare spawn and someone invites me, but the mob disappears in front of me because the layer my group is now on happens to be a layer where said rare isn't spawned, that's a problem.
---
You invite them and you're good. They will hop to your layer and you can all fight the rare spawn.
---
These are really small temporary inconviniences that can be surpassed easily with a litle of that thing that vanilla is so renowned about .. socialization. 
---
On the other hand if down the road your server is dead cause 70% of the pop left you will not have any SS v TM battles at all. And if you encounter a rare spawn and ask for help in LFG but nobody answers. What will you do then?
---
That makes you a ninja.  Grats for admitting it.
---
Want to choose a unique class. I like being rare and uncommon sort of
---
Is it really true some classes/specs aren’t viable? How far could I get if I give max effort and have open minded people willing to attempt and execute it?
---
Druid/Paladin Tank
---
Druid/Paladin DPS
---
Druid Healer
---
I found people tend to get caught up in the stereotypes in this game all the years I’ve played it
---
If the person doesn’t have the mental fortitude to commit to a caloric deficit, they sure as hell aren’t going to hit the treadmill while waiting for a raid to form. My response to you offers how to eat cheap (a point of yours), healthy (a point of yours), and that you must start with a proper diet before thinking pushups will fix everything (a wrong point of yours). 
---
You’ve got practically everyone in here trying to explain to you that you can’t outrun a bad diet,  how simply using stretch bands at your desk won’t undo 5 cheeseburgers and a litre if Mountain Dew, and instead of taking any constructive criticism you’ve resorted to calling people asshole. Awesome post you got going here.
---
I found that taking time on the pservers was much more rewarding than blasting through on muscle memory. The early story lines are pretty lore rich if you take the time to read them, and they translate right through to the endgame content form vanilla.
---
Its not a worthless stat and you will need def cap for progression on some bosses, but nothing in MC. Once you have enough armor and dodge and your healers are geared its a far less valuable stat, but its pretty likely that when you first get to nef his crits will kill the tank 9/10 times
---
Why are you flagged for pvp in the Barrens?
---
Awh... This made me cry for some reason... Such a bitter sweet send off for such a big part of your youth.
---
Stealth is slow and you get caught more often. That's the first major difference you'll find.
---
If you're making a group to run a particular instance for a particular item and you're calling it reserved, you advertise it as such when forming the group.  If someone doesn't like the terms, they don't have to join your group, simple as that.
---
Might take you longer to form your group, but that's still faster than having to do multiple runs and losing rolls on your desired item.  If anyone gets butthurt about reserved items, remind them they don't have to join your group and it doesn't affect them.  If they agree to join then get mad later, that's their problem, not yours.
---
found the vanilla prot paladin
---
Beta invites stopped going out a *long* time ago.
---
You sure those stack?
---
 I'd be more interested if you brought a wolf and gave all the melee an attack power buff for example
---
Nice, thanks for the useful info.
---
When I first started playing wow I thought you had to do that. I would always hearth, go to the inn, and /sleep on a bed before logging off. I thought thats how you got rested XP lol
---
Just no. Actually read what I wrote. I go with the rules of the group, I have never ninjad any item, if the group agrees need boe then of course I am going to need a boe and either use on an alt or sell. If it's MS &gt; OS &gt; Alt &gt;AH or any combination I couldn't care less, the rules set are the rules abided. If I don't agree to a rule that the rest want either suck it up or find a different group. It's super simple.
---
End of the day I lean towards a preference of needing all blue boes because everyone has partaken in the effort to get there, everyone has just as much right to roll on it as anyone else in the group, whether for selling or personal use.
---
Ninjaing an item is rolling need despite agreeing to roll greed on boe or needing a bop that you can't use/have/is a downgrade. Following the set rules is not, and never has been or can be, ninjaing an item.
---
Layers are going to be merged. Layers merging is literally the exact same thing as servers merging, except you are calling them layers instead of servers. 
---
Whether merging has disadvantages is completely irrelevant because blizzards plan already includes merging all layers in phase 2.
---
Ya, I realize that as well, but I've read multiple places that it's more than 52 AP. I'm gonna look for it and let you know what I find.
---
+52 AP is like.. 4 DPS? Doesn't seem like it's good at ALL.
---
If you're purely aoe to level as a mage you should be half way done by the time you hit 60.
---
Or floating out in the Sea of Fatigue
---
Tell her that you'll gladly answer any questions she has, but other than that, don't smother her with details.
---
Having someone there saying "Do this, do that, oh, you want to go here, not there." is going to make it not fun.
---
I was somewhat against it when it was announced, and when fans described it as basically joining a server that will later be merged with other servers in a pre-determined group when the servers eventually decline.  I am totally against it now that I have seen it is glorified phasing.
---
What should they do?  Scrap it completely.  Do what they did in the past.  Population issues arise in 3 forms - servers too full, servers too empty, and servers with faction imbalance.  Offer free transfers from full to dead servers, offer free transfers of horde players to alliance-heavy realms and vice versa.  
---
Those that want to play Classic will play it.  Those that are just there to see what it's like and are met with long queue times - congratulations, you saw what it was like.  After the initial wave and when everything settles down, the queue times will drop and players can play as they did in Classic.
---
If orc is your 2nd favorite, go orc. Axe skill and hardiness are amazing. But it's been said many time before: don't let racials be the only deciding factor. You can still perform incredibly well as another race.
---
All I can say is that  your perspective will change. If you're gonna argue that you can be angry without harming anyone because you're just such a badass and you don't care, you're probably not that mature yet. Don't know what else to tell you bud.
---
+1 to this. Don’t force it
---
Do not pick her race and class.  Tell her what faction you play on and suggest she make a character there, but don't force even that especially at first.   Let her make whatever class she wants as whatever race she wants, even if it's a nelf priest or something equally silly seeming to you. 
---
Do not tell her what to do or how to do it in game.    Help her adjust a few basic settings if she asks, explain the *very basic* controls (literally just WASD, the mouse, and say...1-5 or 1-6 hotkeys to start), then get out of the way and let he be silly noob and make all the mistakes that make you, as an experienced player, cringe to the depths of your soul.  If she starts to get frustrated or struggle, help her, but dont' tell her what to do or do it for her.  Just explain what's going on IF she's confused, and offer a few suggestions.  
---
Avoiding forcing your excited plans for perfect duos on her and avoiding information overload are going to be key.
---
I dream of the day my DPS pays attention to finishing mobs off to give me spirit tap. Right now the best I can do is get lucky with a wand shot!
---
How's this done?
---
Most enjoyable? Have her wait until August 27 and then let the game speak for itself.
---
Oh does it have to be NA? I'm sub'ed to EU
---
Look up ISBoxer and the add on Gnomish Sequencer Enhanced.  Drive from the warrior and two keybindings for Pally DPS (consecrate and judgment on one and seal on the other).  Then make two buttons for heals (one on warrior, one on Paladin)—I’d suggest Alt keys.  Finally make 9 or 0 a blessing / battle shout macro.
---
Most of the time, it will feel like playing a warrior with healing spells and a wonky pet.

I tried asking this question in my own post but it got deleted for being a "low effort" question so now I'm posting it in comment sections (thanks mods).
---
As a ghost, can you run from one zone to another and rez at a different spirit healer?
---
It was released in Europe in February 2005. But yeah it's going to be far busier than back then.
---
warlocks can solo all of dire maul north and east, anywhere with demons, including the bosses. enslave demons is OP. for the bosses you kill them with a combination of kiting, curses, dots, and sacrificing your VW for the continuous HP regen(which you then turn into mana).
---
Not to nitpick, but isn't that how it was pre scaling anyway? Cata remade all the 1-60 zones, 60-70 was always outland and 70-80 was always wotlk, both pre cataclysm.
---
Oh good, its here. I’m thinking about hunter or warrior right now. I’m leaning more towards hunter since it’s my main right now in retail.
---
But ah, afaik Hunters are ok at best. 
---
But warriors, ahh I mean, imagine having the classic Arcanite reaper and melt people in bgs!
---
Will I regret rolling a Hunter over a Warrior? :(
---
Enchanthing on alt bank for me.
---
If we are talking at lauch on the fresh servers. I wont take enchanting on my main because I want two gathering profession (skin-herb)
---
My bank will be enchant / leatherworking to craft and DE.  I will keep most of mats and sell what I need to sell when im lvl 39 for my main mount.
---
Wont take any other profession on my Bank
---
I think you can, but only if youve discovered it before. Otherwise, if memory serves, youll rez with sickness at a closer one to your body.
---
They just keep layering in the game for a few more phases. Literally no downside :^)
---
Beta minibar has the battle.net icon for social panel
---
Yes I believe so. I say this because people use ghost walking to get to areas faster. Also for more basic questions try r/AzerothNoob
---
no it makes everyone rolling greed incredibly stupid.  it's like calling people who roll greed ninjas for not just passing lol.   if some people pass then you're a ninja!  rolling greed is the same as passing roll need and theres no problems no ninjas everyone gets fair loot.  you're completely and utterly devoid of logic.
---
Yeah but to be honest, without other players even streamers will have a hard time "creating content"...
---
&gt;Those that are just there to see what it's like and are met with long queue times - congratulations, you saw what it was like.
---
I see. So you're saying that new players can just fuck off. Nice! No gatekeeping here. Move along people.
---
Awesome! Glad to hear. Guess I’m decided now.
---
Aww. Youre asking everywhere.
---
It's been a while since I've made a dungeon quest guide video. This is one of my all time favorite leveling dungeons in Classic. I play a Warrior and I absolutely love collecting the Scarlet Mail set even though once I turn 40 I just start dumping it for Plate. It's just cool to walk around in all that Red and White. What I find so cool about the place is that it's four separate instances, and you finally start to see some interesting boss encounters. Mograine and Whitemane feel like a mini-raid boss almost with their multi-phase fight which is always super fun even though these days it's very easy. I hope you all like this one, and more are to come.
---
That always worked, in classic and retail. The case in classic just was, that there weren't much spirit healers.
---
Knew what this was going to be. Clicked anyway.
---
I think I'm gonna start doing this too because that sounds freaking awesome.
---
Did you play TBC?
---
I’ll probably go this route, thanks!
---
When someone in your party creates a basic campfire to do some cooking, it is basically required to /sit next to the fire until they are finished for the coziness. It is known.        
---
         
---
Also you /sit in giant chairs that don't actually have the 'chair' interaction option so you can take sweet screenshots...like in the big thrones at the end of some dungeons.
---
I for one will happily sit through my 10-20min queue to play on a populated and living server.
---
Hey fair enough man! Hence the disclaimer in the first minute of the video, stating that this video probably isn't for you then! I personally love speedrunning and preparing for a run is 90% of the work.
---
It was isolated to one single post I made but it was deleted for being low effort. But a deleted post doesn't answer questions, so I asked elsewhere lol
---
I for one welcome our tyrannical low effort meme-banning moderation staff.  May they rule this subreddit a thousand years.  Banzai!
---
I don't remember if this was changed in a later patch but I'm pretty sure if you rez at a graveyard in a new zone it still ports to the one closest to your body. 
---
I remember preach reading a drama time where someone tried this and it ported them back to the zone woth their corpse in it.
---
Lol bro hunter is better than warrior in almost every aspect
---
Everyone talking about Horde or alliance because of quests or dungeons. What about the fact that Horde races are way cooler then tinkers and iron workers that live in caves. A fucking Cow that shapeshifts!!
---
Ghost walking?
---
A lot of us are tired of the constant "I'm so excited" posts.
---
So.. no.
---
Lol I always remember reading about the giant intergalactic battle that ended up in like the $400k range for real money value lost 
---
I bet that type of thing is well worth it though, getting to participate in an in-game event of that scale.
---
Can’t wait to see the look on people’s faces when they realize quite a few staves are massive warrior upgrades
---
You are going to laugh, but honestly farming sim 19 and American Truck Simulator have been great games to play, progress through, and relax my mind while patiently waiting for classic.  I can definitely see myself still doing some tasks on my farm to make my life feel simpler even after classic has come out.
---
Yeah just park the bank alt by a mailbox in a major city, learn enchanting and get minor boot speed enchant. Mail your farmed stacks to him to AH. Be sure to study what is actually worth selling on the AH as there is many many items that are better sold to vendors.
---
Paladin tanking is a joke in classic unless you have very disaplinned dps and/ or are tanking stratholm or scholomance. It can be done but it’s difficult without a taunt. The dungeon takes a lot longer because your mana is drained after every fight. Same goes for dps. Even if you have all your pre bis for a rest pally you will still mostly get shit on by a mage wearing greens (unless you’re fighting undead). 
---
If you’re a paladin then in 99% of cases you will be healing unless the group is letting you meme. It’s something I had to accept as I always play pally in vanilla. 
---
In pvp nothing beats holy/ prot as you’re almost unkillable.
---
Oh wow that's an amazing tip, I'll be rolling a hunter so super useful don't think I've noticed that one before.
---
Just FYI, Retadin is a very very popular class. So if you want to DPS as a pally, you def can. But if being rare and uncommon is important to you, that would not be the way to go.
---
I've never posted a single meme to this subreddit, yet my posts still get deleted. Whether I'm asking a question, sharing a picture from the stress test, or simply trying to share my feelings. I'm actually surprised this post hasn't been removed yet.
---
When a BoE epic/rare drops and it's a pug group, at least one person will be waiting to ninja it in most cases. The safe bet has always been to need on items that are very clearly going to be sold by whoever wins the roll.
---
Not only is orc out of your hands, but it's not even a guaranteed anything. Also if you have to sit a full fear as a rogue you've already lost.
---
I rolled a Rogue bank alt in original vanilla.  I remember I could Disenchant anything at any level at first, but I had to level to 35 later to enchant and maybe DE at 1.12? I also leveled lockpicking and I picked locked boxes for tips.  I happened to be Dwarf too so I could see chests when I was leveling.  Maxed out cooking and fishing as well. It was a nice combo for banking. I eventually leveled to 60 anyway, PvP'd, got a title and the PvP set... Figured I could queue in the cities easy enough while banking/AH'ing. 
---
Leveling bank toons happens sometimes, so maybe pick something you'd maybe want to play as an alt later, especially BGs, in addition to use as storage?  A Mage might be nice for the portal/food/water tips... Or a Lock, for the Uber transit services?  I'm gonna make a Dwarf Rogue again for IF bank, and a Human Lock for backup banking in SW as well.
---
I always did this, also in modern WoW. And before this I did /yawn
---
It's missing the bug report interface, that's the easier way to tell it's not the classic beta.
---
I've not been able to find historical broadband coverage maps at this time. The old coverage maps that provided data, but only back to 2011, have been deprecated ([https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2018/12/07/decommissioning-national-broadband-map-and-its-apis](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2018/12/07/decommissioning-national-broadband-map-and-its-apis)) and the new map appears to not provide historical data.  
---
I'll see if I can find better information on the regional coverage  again this evening, but wanted to touch base with you. For an anecdote, the suburb I lived in through 2006 had very spotty broadband availability. Friends across town had dial-up or if they were lucky, DSL. But the QoS for the DSL provider was shit. I was fortunate to live in a neighborhood that had been planned when the Superconducting Super Collider was still going to be a thing and had cable when we moved there, starting in 96(?).  
---
Regarding the 200ms latency on dial up even for close servers, counter strike needed very little network traffic to operate. To speculate, you likely had terribly maintained and/or old phone lines for your last mile leading to packet loss and an increase in the average time for a packet to reach the destination.
---
Post high effort content. Or even moderate effort content. That means posting stuff that gives us something to discuss.
---
Most guilds that will be raiding by the end of phase 1 have already chosen their MT. Unless you plan on leading a guild yourself or are close friends with someone who will be, there's a fairly low chance that you'll be MT.
---
You talk like a 12 year old.
---
I mean you can only see so many "im so hype for classic" and " retail bad classic good" posts before it gets obnoxious
---
Not dps though which is what most people think is important
---
No particular order here is what I remember:
---
* Almost all classes prioritize stam, which fits in line with the PVP sets having way more stam than the PVE ones.
---
* On release damage dealt compared to healing done is rather low. As patches go by and raids open up, the damage increases FAR quicker than healing does. By the time Naxx rolls around certain classes will be nearly impossible to out-heal the damage of, Warlocks, Mages, Warriors, and Rogues come to mind here. 
---
* Most classes want weapons and trinkets from PVE, until rank 14 weapons become available.
---
* Money is tough as a PVPer. You still have repair costs, you have to purchase PVP gear from vendors, and PVP itself does not yield much.
---
* PVP rankers will have premade groups / guilds they use to farm honor. These guys farm BGs over and over for honor. They do it every single day for hours and hours. It's a fucking blast
---
* The faction with instant queues can afford to "dodge" premades that will cause them to get a very slow and painful win (think 1hr wsg vs their normal 8-10 minute wsg win) - it's better to lose in 10 min and re-queue
---
* The faction with ~1hr queues will try to suck all honor possible from the game. They'll cap wsg flags 2/3, hold the final flag in their base while their team attempts to GY farm you. That's when you cancel the rez and sit as a ghost, forcing them into no honor and finishing the match.
---
* If you are in the premade BG group and get a dishonorable kill, you will get black listed ASAP. This applies to everyone in the group (maybe just people near you when you get the DK) - We used to run around Ashenvale waiting for WSG queues and Astrannar is full of DKs
---
if being alive for an additional 15 years hasnt made you more cynical, i envy you
---
This reminds me of when I used to queue as tank as a very geared boomkin for 5 man heroics in WotLK... one time someone was furious that I queued as tank and then when he saw us clear the dungeon in like 10 minutes or less he asked if we wanted to requeue
---
No idea really \^\^ I'm not so interested in the speed of it - I like it more because it means I don't have to quests or solo. But I believe it's pretty competetive in an XP/hour calculation, but needs to be executed well, as you need to coordinate with 4 other people. At one point in Kargoz video he had to run to thunder bluff to train maces while the others already had done so. So 4 people were waiting for 1 guy, that's really hurting the XP/hour. But even so, I just think I'd find it much more enjoyable.
---
Centaurs, Kodos, and Demons OH MY!!!!!!
---
90% Of threads here:
---
"I'm so excited!"
---
"Nothing else but Classic matters!"
---
"What class do I roll?"
---
"Here's my 150 reasons why retail sucks compared to classic that has been posted 50 times already"
---
Good. Only thing that wants me to roll warrior is: cool gear and getting a big weapon upgrade just to see the big difference in pvp.
---
But hunter has more cool stuff.
---
In the stress test levels 1-5, I tried this in STV and it failed.  Ported me right back to my body’s nearest Spirit Healer.
---
If you’re making another post about layering or leeway, you may as well be posting a low effort meme.
---
Yea, *if* correct that was why I decided to go UD, just seems too minor to give up cannibalize and wotf. If i was concerned about PVE dps I'd roll troll anyways '_&gt;'
---
Ok so downvote them instead of deleting them? Also it's not just my "I'm excited for this to come out" posts that get deleted, screenshots and questions and discussion posts I've made have also been deleted. This is actually the first thing I've posted that hasn't been immediately deleted in a while, it's kind of ironic actually
---
They're supposed to be making sure everything works, and actively trying to push things to find bugs. It's a beta test, not a game.
---
I was listening to it more but it seems it gets so technical that I can’t even follow a lot of the time. I also don’t like how it goes right into his other podcast right after
---
How many crowd pummelers does it take for one raid night?
---
yeah casuals love sitting in 20 minute flightpaths.  lol
---
Oh, and remember DE materials post free on the AH, so they should be a decent money maker and you can repost forever for free.
---
Yes. You can travel to any graveyard of your faction and rez yourself there.
---
I like it! That's exactly how I did it on live, and it worked great. I was a rogue and was tired of dealing with constant competition for loot and ended up just creating my own groups and used reserves.
---
Didn't even know Europe got a later release.  So I guess Europe had it's own rush, I was just going off the November 2004 release for US.
---
The article is largely about discomfort, and pain in workers who do nothing but stand for 8 hours a day, and cardiovascular risk for the elderly who do the same.  Yea, no shit.  I don't expect people to come home from work and stand playing Classic for 4 hour stretches on concrete.  But if people are out of shape and sit all day at work and then come home to sit all night at the computer, well, they should definitely be standing for a few hours instead.
---
"WoW" and "low system requirements" doesn't fit together
---
My screenshot of my raid killing hogger in the stress test was deleted. Why would that get deleted? Is the stress test a joke to this sub?
---
No gatekeeping.  Everyone had to do it back in Classic.  I expect to do it myself.
---
Your best bet is being the winter's chill mage for your guild. You are able to pick up a fair amount of the stronger pvp talents such as double ice block and barrier, while still being maximized for pve.
---
Dude, I'm in the same boat. I can only play about 4-6 hours a week. So I'll be focusing on the leveling experience along with AoE farming when/where I can while I level so that I have some good mats and golds built up. I'm willing to bet that by the time I hit 60 I'll have all the golds I'll need. Just try not to focus on getting to 60 or you'll kill yourself by pressuring yourself into playing more, it'll become a chore rather than something you for fun!
---
That's more than anyone has ever played this game at any point in time. This game is 14 years old and advertising has been limited.
---
Thanks :)
---
No, it is phase 2.
---
And then your reputation is trashed because one of your party members (who also would have just sold it) decides to remove context and get you blacklisted.
---
Well I'm not going to go searching for I don't know what in hopes in finding evidence for your claim, but rest assured, I believe you.
---
Unfortunately for you, I'm not talking about leeway. If you check out 'wow classic: funniest moments (ep. 18) and go to 16:40, you'll see a clip which concerns me. I'm not familiar with traps taking that absurdly long to work, and there's no leeway at play here. I hope I'm wrong.
---
I've played 3 or 4 druids in the past, but never in vanilla. I love the versatility, but they can't easily swap spec in vanilla. I love resto healing but want to be able to solo quest at times too.
---
Shaman seems more viable for my interest but for some reason the anesthetic just never clicked with me. It feels more bland and straight forward to play, and everything is just thunder this earth that water this totem totem totem. And totems feel tedious, not nearly as fun as shape-shifting
---
I also love tanking, easily my favorite role, but I've always tanked as a pally or DK, never a warrior. The warrior sorta suffers from the same aesthetic mediocrity (for my personal taste) as shaman. Everything relying on shield skills or reactionary skills feels lame to me. 
---
Thoughts between these three class choices? (I'm rolling horde, so no pally, and not interested in priest mage rogue or hunter. Will be rolling a warlock separate from the three mentioned above, but I don't want to only have a dps only class)
---
[The tabard in question](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n8mhz5dl9dutoy2/tabard.PNG?dl=0)
---
Okay, good points. Regardless, DM isn't until Phase 2. What are you going to use until then, if not Warden Staff.
---
Basically your tip is be a high level.
---
An interesting perspective. I just have no experience on fresh servers, so I just didn't see any value in providing my own opinion.
---
Yah, you explained it quite well.   
---
"They r dumb.  Me R smart".
---
Indeed.  Even if you die you can pretty much guarantee their death as well in about 4 globals.
---
They'll see it as a cheat, even if you want to keep abusing it, and screaming that it isn't.
---
I think it will be smaller than anyone is expecting. The polls consistently show that players are 25-35 years of age. This mostly means the player base is recapturing those who played originally. Of those people, only a fraction will care to play. I project 2-3 million, with severe attrition
---
Desolace is so comfy, probably one fourth of the pop STVietnam has.
---
Is this a serious question? Do you actually consider that a quality post worthy of discussion? 
---
I smell a troll....
---
LOL what??
---
i'll test this tonight
---
Why are you even here? Go back to retail, you'll quit classic within a week.
---
No. It won’t.
---
I do exactly that, so I have a place to store my own materials for enchants I may want in the future and to sell any excess materials I collect for profits. The additional storage is great too.
---
I definetely see the merits of it, and your arguement is the arguement. I just don't believe it'll be that easy or effective. At later levels it takes a lot more wand hits to take out the last few %HP. This is either downtime, or time with the healer out of play. It not just needs to be executed well, it needs to be executed perfectly.
---
Even then, spirit tap is not the holy grail filled with endless free mana. On my 26 priest pointed out earlier, I think I'm pretty good at stealing killing blows in dungeons, but I still have to drink during dungeons. You really have to play well around the 5second rule to get a ton of mana out of it. Mind blasting for the killing blow, still puts you into the 5SR, and MB costs a lot of mana, so that's not really viable as an efficiency method. MB into Spirit tap, leaves the first 5 second of spirit tap at only half effectiveness, and then you got the last 10 seconds, where if you wanted to get the full benefit, you are not allowed to cast, which is not ideal if you want to keep moving.
---
Doing all this (killing with wands, not casting during spirit tap), I still go through water in dungeons, and that's with a normal tank-n-spank group with, hopefully, only 1 guy needing heals.
---
Alas, this is all just speculation, as we've yet to see a dedicated team do this, and I might definetely be wrong. From my experience on private servers, where numbers might be screwed, spirit tap is just not THAT good.
---
Your point around Fortitude as buffer though, is really valid. It's a big hit to take not having fortitude, but you gain other stuff aswell. Does it outweigh fortitude? No. Do they even eachother out? I don't know, I havn't done the math, but I think they do. And I think it'd be a much more fun play, with a more versatile group :)
---
I re-subbed for the stress test and decided to log onto retail to see my old characters and see how much has changed but my god... it's not even wow anymore. Retail is a completely new game and I am not a fan lol
---
Most of the southern Kalimdor areas are off my to do list, I might cherry pick a few quests but generally I'd rather grind somewhere a little greener than go to the desert.
---
No. In Vanilla, you could programmatically cast spells using only macros or addons. That's how most healer addons and Decursive worked back then. If you really knew what you were doing, you could code rudimentary bots using methods that completely were within the ToS because you were just using Blizzard's own addon APIs. That's why Classic is using the modern add-on/macro API with newer things removed rather than a genuine recreation of the Vanilla one.
---
Now, having established that, one of the things you could do back then was make an addon that would let you set a window where if a spell had X milliseconds remaining on the cast, then use the stopcasting command and start casting the new spell. Because the server had already decided that the spell had gone off, it would still cast. 
---
During TBC, even though you couldn't do it programmatically, people made macros for all of their spells that started with stopcasting and then used cast bar addons like Quartz to do this manually.
---
The net effect of all this is that having the spell queue in Classic just means people don't have to do all that crap and can just play the game normally without having to give up ~5% of their DPS or whatever just because they don't know better.
---
This was confirmed ? an LA realm? As far as I read there's no latin american realm, our ping will be huge if we have to play in the NA realms :(
---
The Orc Racial allows for a 25% stun resist.
---
 [Hardiness](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20573/hardiness) \- Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%. 
---
Blood Fury is good if you are DPS and not expecting to take a lot of damage which should be the case as a Rogue. But as a tank or off-tank the lack of healing really screws you.
---
Because the queue is better than an exploitable feature, which only exists because the developers do not have faith in the server population to grow after launch or for their ability to manage server population as they did back in 2004.
---
I consider it more enjoyable not having to run to desolace to hand in a quest that gives 500xp with no follow up. Leveling guides help avoid that type of scenario that seemed pretty common in vanilla leveling.
---
Thank you.
---
I don't agree that it's rare but even if it only happened once ever that's still no reason not to fix it.
---
In fact the blue post that announced spell batching even referred to it as relatively common.
---
The shaman can drop WF totem, drink for 10 seconds in between needing heals and have literally the same effect without the hassle of needing to land the killing blow for spirit tap to work in the first place.
---
&gt;WF is nice but it's not as good as you seem to think it is.
---
Surely, you jest?
---
Bienvenido amigo! esperemos que haya un server latino, sino tendremos mucho ping en los norte americanos.  
---
(I'll give you some spanish for you to practice =P)
---
Felt like repost bingo reading this.
---
Not that it's a particularly bad take, but this wouldn't be implemented.
---
Yeah.  Utterly ridiculous for Blizzard to announce layering with so little time to go.  No time to work on alternative solutions, plus the core group that asked for vanilla is saturated with tourists so they won't get the unanimous rejection they'd have gotten if they proposed it 7 months ago.
---
So as I'm trying every class on certain servers, the Warlock is REALLY shining to me while levelling (everyone is 10-20). I have yet to feel so powerful levelling, barely have to stop to heal/drink, everything dies so fast and consistently etc. 
---
So basically, what are you biggest cons of Warlock and why would I be better with another class? PVE focus btw
---
&gt; If you have enough gear. You can go ham as fury. Is it as good as Arms? No of course not but, Arms is the strongest group pvp spec in the game. Fury though once you get that gear flowing. Can freaking level teams.*
---
*Pocket Healer not included with purchase
---
Because now Im going to multibox
---
damn this is a great idea. farm my sub for the next few weeks
---
Do alliance almost always have thr instant bg q? For the two servers i played as horde that was the case, since pvp pop on horde side tends to be larger due to better pvp racials
---
30 sec wait only for use trinkets right?
---
times have changed you're nutty if you think the average person is going to play classic and be like yeah this is way better than retail!  this is the problem with reddit too many people get confused and think that reddit is representative of the whole.  reddit is the people so excited by classic that they sought out the fucking reddit for it, the millions of potential players are going to play for a week be level 17 and be like wait this fucking sucks why is everything so slow when do I get my mount all I do is fucking walk everywhere????
---
This game will have a smallish dedicated fanbase and nothing more.
---
WoW was made for casuals, play 1999 Everquest then hop back to classic, it’s a walk in the park by comparison
---
Warlock you typically dot up one mob and pull the next.  If you are constantly at full health and/or mana then you aren't warlocking correctly.
---
Dude thank you I would have never known about this
---
Agreed. I've never had a post deleted for rule 7, cause I don't post garbage.
---
I mean, if you're leveling smart you shouldn't go straight from Redridge-&gt;Duskwood-&gt;STV.  If you try that you'll be underleveled for everything.  Better to travel more and complete more zones.  There's plenty of alliance leveling 20-30 so you can easily push into the 30's before needing to move on.  And then you can do Shimmering Flats or Hillsbrad before going to STV.
---
Basically what I'm saying is, lots of players get a fixed idea of where they "want to level", and force it even when they're underleveled and it's miserable.  If you level more adaptively you can level at things always below your level until about level 40 or so, where doing every quest possible becomes mandatory.
---
So yeah, don't be so eager to do the "fun" zones you skip the "unfun" zones and make yourself miserable.  STV, Westfall, etc I find are much more enjoyable when you're overleveled.
---
Go Orc, stun resist and blood fury for a rogue is way more OP than the WotF. You already have a pvp trinket that does the same
---
No, Paris
---
read the entire sentence before hitting reply next time
---
Especially with the 25-35 year old generation. the effects all these multimedia options we have will definitely show when we're 75+ lol
---
Shimmering flats... oh boy those grindy quest, those vultures are nightmare fuel
---
Complicated? You mean like the massive amount of tweaks they are trying to do to Layering as we speak to fix bugs and exploits?
---
This really isn't that complex.  For all intents and purposes for the player, it's just individual static servers.
---
he does talk about the quest order he is doing is designed with a shit load of people in mind if you just watch the video
---
&gt;that is what makes it all so entertaining
---
\*If you pick the good ones of course.
---
you're a minority, everyone thats on this sub in the minority.  most people want instant everything I'd bet money 90% of people don't even make it to 60 before quitting.
---
&gt; If you use the old graphics,
---
But its running on the new client. Of course it wont be high hardware requirements, but it will be significantly higher than the pserver client, right?
---
You do realize that one of their 3 is a warlock right?
---
Leeway compensates for inaccurate transform data between 2 objects (player-player) in the game world.
---
Being able to queue an ability has nothing to do with range as the ability can only go off when in range.
---
you're too inept to even read.  bye
---
Same reason I'm rolling a Mage on a PvE server. Great lvling speed and I don't have to worry about getting ganked by everyone higher lvl than me lol Just need to decide Horde or Alliance
---
Well, at least I can say I tried, and have something to link to anyone who says there's no other solution or that all we do is complain.
---
What server did you play on? I sat through many multi hour queue times to get into Illidan on Friday evenings. Often times I would end up just playing something else because of it.
---
Huh, played BC and never raided Karazhan?? You missed out!
---
Casual for the genre is not the same as casual for the broader 2019 gaming audience.
---
In every case I recall in vanilla, Horde had instant / faster queues than alliance. I played both Alli and Horde in vanilla so I was on two servers in different battlegroups - Darkspear (A) and Magtheriadon (H)
---
Not in Venezuela indeed
---
One thing I realized on my most recent trip to 60 as rogue is that you have to fight a lot of elemetals while leveling. It really sucks to fight elementals when you're relying on bleeds and poison for a lot of your damage, because they are immune to bleed and poison.
---
So are skeletons, ghosts, and a few other mob types.
---
If you go hemo for leveling you're really going to hate the quests that send you after those mob types.
---
It's a screenshot of a lvl 1 raid that killed hogger in classic wow stress test, how is that not something that should be posted on /r/classicwow ? 
---
No, I don't consider it a "quality post worthy of discussion," but it's still *relevant* to the game. I didn't sip my tea and tilt my fedora and say "hmm yes the chaps over at /r/classicwow will fancy a chat over this." I was excited and wanted to share my experience with people who would understand it. But I guess that's low effort, so I'll just have fun playing this game by myself.
---
I have an i5-4460 and an R9 280x and played in Uldir with lowest settings to have it rather smooth without big fps drops. And I always had problems with WoW compared to other "low system requirement" games.
---
That's awesome to know thanks you that info, I can't wait for this experience, it's going to be awesome!
---
I don’t agree at all with them, but probably things like Flying, Dailies, and Badges.
---
I say 2H is Stronger in MC, but will be Overtaken at the End of BWL. But You can Play 2H even in Naxx.
---
Some other screens: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/8lRkEL6.jpg Farming Tyr's was pretty easy.
---
https://i.imgur.com/hFCWLR2.jpg Showing the crazy range on regular hits.
---
It was extremely fun to see insane numbers popping up but obviously completely broken for PvP, I think I once hit a warrior for 6k with a shadowbolt with just MC gear.
---
A queue is not good, but it is better than an exploitable system.
---
If you think otherwise, I really hope the queue is in place.  I don't want to gatekeep newcomers, but I am happy to gatekeep the type of players who are willing to compromise on game integrity.
---
"Mileage may vary" Fantastic lol
---
In how many threads are you going bitch about your threads getting deleted? Christ, I hope they just ban your account from the sub.
---
Literally like two months ago?  And it's been filled with bugs, abuses, and awful experiences and been reviled the entire time?  They clearly announced it without enough time to test it and replace/remove it.
---
True multiple accounts is less great but a warlock summon bot is always useful in a raiding guild - guildies can have clicker lackeys and locks next to green dragon spawns for example
---
MEATHEALS.COM ... You CAN heal from your maladies.
---
With that being said, hell yeah dude. Thats awesome you were able to save enough to take a nice "life break" now and just chill out. Look into that website I posted about though... For real... Guarantee this can massively reduce your problems if not eliminate them entirely. And the heightened focus/energy you get from the carnivore diet will only carry over into your WoW prowess ;)
---
I can only see one of your posts being removed as Low Effort, and that was by AutoModerator. If AutoModerator removes something you're encouraged in the removal message to modmail us so that we can review. 
---
We're reliant on the filters to keep things even remotely sane, but they do occasionally flag things incorrectly. We don't mind reviewing removals, from AutoModerator or another Moderator, in the slightest. That's not to say we'll repeal the decision, but you'll get a second opinion and we are always happy to over rule each other.
---
lots of people are going to be on at once, maybe even too many people for a certain area. to fix this, blizzard proposed "layers", basically a different temporary server within your server so you aren't competing with 100000 people for killing a mob or harvesting a herb.
---
some people suspect it will be bad for immersion, and you might even get put on a "layer" by yourself
---
I wish dude.. My wife is the farthest thing from someone who would ever play a video game lol It's literally the one thing we don't have in common. I would love for her to play though. Would be awesome
---
I just don't get the thought process of some people, it seems with all the talk about classic people have really forgotten that Blizzard dropped the numbers to 10 and 25 man raids because guilds had so many issue filling a raid. Now people are on Reddit down playing anything not deemed the APEX of "insert role here", I hate to break it to y'all but if you want 40 people you're going to be taking some undergeared/non BiS equiped, non optimal speccd, literal bodies, because what does less DPS than a Moonkin? An empty raid slot.
---
Kushrooms!
---
Something fun my girlfriend and I did on a private server was spend a lot of time exploring water based zones with the water walking guardian elixirs. She had alchemy. It really gives you a different perspective in zones like Stranglethornvale, feralas, and hillsbrad. I enjoyed this a lot.
---
Thanks! I will try and find a way for it to work on mobile before I post anymore, just a lot of info on that tiny screen :O
---
Get one of her friends to play so you can make it a threesome!
---
Im in the same situation here. Basically rotating between FFXIV, Warframe and Retail WoW just to burn time till Classic.
---
Not a lie.. I didn't rush to 60 by any means - I was very conscious of the looking cost of the mount and focussed on affording it when I reached max level. In retrospect I probably could have made the money more easily once I reached level 60.
---
I think I still have a screenshot somewhere of me playing in a 50-59 wsg with my epic mount which would prove my claim. Unfortunately id have to wait until I can check my other PC to see if it still exists.
---
Also, I know you're being tongue and cheek with "send it to Blizzard", which there's no way to do, but if I saw J Allen Brack eating dinner at the same restaurant as me I'd write this shit on a napkin and slam it down in front of him.
---
The fact that this dishonest tantrum was over one post makes it even funnier tbh.
---
Holy crap I used to do this as a kid lol
---
Not in classic WoW specifically but omg when did I stop doing this
---
I've seen people transfer servers because they were falsely "outed" by someone who wanted their raid spot. Any sort of community blacklist gets abused - trying to give one credibility ends up being a huge burden on the server community.
---
It is not the same issue though. Don't get me wrong, however small the impact of this movement thing is i don't think it adds anything positive to the game in 2019. But when you complain about spell batching and 2/3 of your reasons for removing it have nothing to do with spell batching it makes you look unknowledgeable and weakens your argument. Especially in Blizzard's eyes were they to read your post. If you wish to be taken seriously with your feedback at least educate yourself on what you are talking about.
---
Thank you for the reply. I did have a post auto-removed earlier today, but it has happened many times over the past couple months in the rare occasion that I do decide to post here. I understand things can get chaotic here, I would just like to say that the requirements needed to be auto-deleted seem to be extremely easy to accidentally meet. Sorry for this mess of a post, I'll do everyone a favor and delete it myself.
---
Been there, it was awkward.
---
the fuck is this rofl
---
From my experience it's actually pretty hard to get "enough" defense on your gear without sacrificing too much other stats you want to have as a tankadin.
---
With healing it is as you say... it largely depends on your group composition and skill/ gear of your tank. Since we're starting on a fresh server and I assume he will do a lot of pugs healing without illumination will feel like healing as an offspec. Even till mediocre performance and gear level of your tank. And then you have no group heal and so on. 
---
My advice would be to do more taking or more healing and choose your skills accordingly. 
---
But 25/26/0 will be the middle ground if you want to do a bit of everything and still being a good healer. Because that's the role you'll be expected to fill. 
---
Too much offspecc healing pallys out there that make your 5mans a pita.
---
Yeah, though there's a decent chance you'll have some +hit from gear here or there, so you can often get away with fewer than 2 points.
---
That said isn't additional +hit is supposed to reduce the effectiveness of talents that reduce chance to be feared like unbreakable will for priests? I'm less clear on how those work, but in theory I think if you have +18% hit chance (+3% for hit cap, +15% for the talent) you totally mitigate a priest being 5/5 in that talent?
---
Obviously that's not worth it, but I think it's possible.
---
They vendor for 2s on the beta. That's the point.
---
This is great advice and many others have said the same thing. I’m going to help with basics but I plan to largely let her do this herself and I’ll be there if she ever gets confused or frustrated.
---
For the HORDE!  Great choice!
---
Oh god that would be cringe worthy and so unhealthy.
---
Funny that Edit 2, Divinity: Original Sin 2 was the only game in that period that I thoroughly enjoyed. Everything else has been meh!
---
Absolutely, my wife play together and we always log off after laying down together
---
Get her into being a hunter, no one can not like having a kitty at your side. :)
---
You're a lot nice than I am. I'm betting 90% of people won't make it to 40.
---
1-40 is a long time to go walking. I'm guessing a lot of people won't be able to handle the slower pace of Classic and it taking several hours to gain a single level.
---
Imagine that one day you'll go and /sleep in the hammock and never come back.
---
Arms is pretty bad in raid content. You probably wouldn't even be using Mortal Strike since it eats a debuff slot.
---
Gotta prime those senses.
---
There were multiple human nations.
---
&gt;I believe the release of Classic WoW will be a turning point for the gaming industry and the rebirth of the genre as we know it.
---
Can't tell if troll or serious.
---
It's going to be greatly successful, but that's because modern wow sucks and there are no mmorpgs that are like classic in 2019.
---
Yup. I love Classic as much as any one else on this subreddit, but this subreddit is definitely a huge echo chamber.
---
&gt; From my experience it's actually pretty hard to get "enough" defense on your gear without sacrificing too much other stats you want to have as a tankadin.
---
The deathbone set alone gives you more than enough defense for 5 man dungeons.
---
In another thread i've read that it is not possible T here it was about the Nightelf route to IF.
---
Yeah that’s my string haha. Sounds like itl be a non issue. Gnomes better be wary of this taurens deez crits
---
Very interesting. Not calling BS or anything, but I'm also in automotive manufacturing (parts, not full cars) but we only ever get off work for vacation or 1 week in July when the big auto manufacturers switch over to producing the next year's models. Other than that, it's 60 hrs/week year-round (Five 12s, usually).
---
Not to knock you trying to do something positive, good on you, but there is a version of this post like every 2 days.
---
What was mentioned as common in a bluepost?  I don't believe that "the pathing thru a hunter's trap" issue was ever commented on by Blizz(source?). But regardless, that issue has nothing to do with spell batching, since they're trigger events based on the location of trap, trap's radius, and location of player. The only thing that is batched is when the trapped is placed, the triggering of the trap only has to do with the server/client communicating the players location, which it only checks at certain intervals, and when they player is running straight I believe those intervals occur less often.(what perp demonstrated)
---
The thing I remember about the spell batching bluepost is that players can cast spells/abilities which can trigger at the same time. Even if one players does it slightly faster than another, if both occur during the same window, then both will resolve simultaneously.The hunter trap or grenade issues are not related to spell batching 
---
Also, I'm not commenting here to argue about what one may prefer and if it should be just like vanilla or if it should be updated/change. So I have no interest in phrases like "It's absolutely ridiculous that I'm having to defend not purposely making spells less responsive." The responsiveness of spells is up to the devs.
---
I always wondered if an MMO would be possible with real, adaptive populations of animals who could go extinct if the players overkilled.  I know something was attempted in a 90's MMO (maybe Ultima Online)? and the players killed the animals to extinction like immediately, but that was also with 90's tech.  I wonder if an MMO today could make it work.
---
IDK, maybe part of the issue is that MMOs and all video games in general are power fantasies, where you can easily kill tons of monsters and humans and heal up in 2 seconds like it ain't no shit.  The reason humans didn't wipe out the planet in reality is because killing shit in real life is dangerous and hard and there's no healing spells.  So maybe the video game genre itself is simply incompatible with realistic population dynamics.
---
Only move faster as a wisp from NE but yes you don't have to get attacked as a ghost.
---
Glad you're a mind reader and can determine what a Realm population will be 3 days in the future.
---
Just a word of warning from someone who has multiboxed. Five mages is bad because you're screwed if a few die. Try to get someone who can Rez. 
---
 I'd put a priest in there.
---
Affli was so bad lmao. What are you even saying? That was legit only viable in some 5s combos and even there it was far from op. 99% of all locks were sl and that was more lame than it was op. Resto druids, ok, they were a tad too strong, although ds was superior if you ask me. Overall tbc was a lot better balanced than classic tho. Classic pvp was never meant to be any competitive. It was purely fun.
---
All of this advice is good, but I would suggest re-binding A and D to strafe, not turn.  Kill bad habits before they even form.
---
Set appropriate graphics settings too, resize chat window text, etc. Change all those weird camera settings.
---
Other than that, just let her lead.  It actually helps immensely if you play a class/race you're unfamiliar with too so that you aren't hyper aware of all the things she's missing / doing "wrong" like killing the wrong mobs because she didn't read the quest or whatever.  Trust that the game will draw her in, you don't need to do anything yourself
---
Hell yeah, gotta be first to 60 to farm the gold necessary to buy out all the cheap twink blues and all the future patch resources before anyone can, that way you don't have to worry about gold later on in the game, having secured enough money to price fix and play the ah.
---
Not in beta, so only experience I have is the videos and other discussions. From what I have seen, it does not appear to be working, at least not in a realistic way.
---
It looks to me like it needs tuning as it gives "unnatural" looking results to encounters between melee and casters. 
---
It also looks like you can do things to avoid AOE and trap like triggers just by moving a certain speed or angle, again, looks like it would feel unnatural.
---
You just should not be able to hit someone from that far away just because they, and perhaps you, are moving.  
---
I get why it is needed, but it looks like it could be tightened up a bit.
---
I kinda disagree. Mages/locks/shadow priest are still among the best dueling classes at 60. So casters would still dominate.
---
I personally think of it in terms of activated (WoF) vs passive (stun resist) being kind of advanced and easy, respectively. If you are a control freak then use WoF, if you are lazier/willing to rely on RNG instead of button presses, then stun resist. Personally, I think undead look better and cannibalizing and WoF are more my style, but grabbing the zerk in Warsong and popping blood fury is undeniable fun.
---
For pve, yeah its good for soloing dungeons and PvP. It works great for pickpocket farming as well as grinding mobs. It isn't a DPS spec it is for PVPing and leveling as per the post requested.
---
Wine 🍷
---
Alliance will probably have faster queues. All the casual hardcore pvp players will pick horde, but all the real hardcore pvp players will pick alliance, then get geared faster as will because paladins are ridiculous raiders.
---
I disagree. Give people the opportunity to be a jerk, that way you find out who the jerks are and you can avoid grouping with them in the future, as well as letting everyone else know what a jerk they are.
---
A high enough number to warrant layering if they are expecting a massive drop off of tourists. This is just logical.
---
Warlocks - quest to unlock voidwalker - think that could be pretty cool.            .
---
&gt;Leeway wasn't on mobs in vanilla
---
[Except it actually was](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8eg81/to_all_of_those_who_claim_melee_leeway_wasnt_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Not all of vanilla mind you, but it did in fact exist. The big difference in how it feels has a lot to do with pings being better now so the argument becomes is it fair to the people with bad ping now to alter leeway in favor of a more "authentic" experience for those with good ping at their expense.
---
Vanilla Warlocks were a party unto themselves. Get a priest friend and you can kill almost anything out there.
---
In original vanilla if you die of fatigue as ghost you could respawn at different spirit healer
---
&gt;Very much so, this is why that whole part of the argument is made under the assumption that blizz is relatively correct in their estimate
---
But if they were correct in their estimates they could just use static servers!
---
&gt;You could have outlier servers, like streamer servers that could prove problematic even under that case, if those realms do end up massively bloated (well, they should put a cap on it),
---
People have the *choice* to play on high pop servers.  We shouldn't alter the game because of streamers!
---
Standing for 4 hours on concrete would be my night with a standing desk.  I am out of shape and standing for 8 hours, perhaps I took this suggestion, and applied it to my situation mistakenly, not thinking of the situations of others.   Sure, if you sit for 8 hours straight at work, a standing desk at home is an option, but the better (and cheaper) option would be to not sit for the 8 hours straight at work, or the 4 hours straight at home.
---
Druids are for tanking my dungeons as I level.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13167#dropped-by
---
or
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13372#dropped-by
---
Totally agreed.  MMORPGs should feel like the wild west, not a streamlined esport.
---
Yet balance seems to be blizzards goal in class design all along.  My conclusion is that vanilla was a real MMORG by accident.  If blizz understood their own game well enough before it went live we would have had TBC class design in vanilla.
---
Yes, you can rez at any spirit healer.
---
I keep going back and forth between wanting to play the same class I did in vanilla (warrior) and trying something new this time around.
---
It’s a hard decision, because I loved warrior then and I think I would again. But a new perspective is appealing too
---
Apparently, attempting to rez at a different spirit healer ports you back to the graveyard closest to your corpse.
---
Was Hammer of Rag not better?
---
Pathetic.
---
In T5 content arcane was the best spec. So it didn't matter that hydross was frost and a'lar fire immune. Overall arcane performs exceptionally well from T5 onwards.
---
If they rolled need, they equip it for the group to see. If they refuse to equip then thats a ninja and you can kick them and put them on the ninja list
---
Oh I would.  I'd have someone videotape it and post it on this sub too.  Total dick move, I know, I'd be thrown out of the restaurant.  Of course, I'm in a completely different state than him, so he has nothing to worry about!
---
Arcanite it is like 24 hour cooldown. Salt shaking is 3 days.
---
I wont choose
---
the guild will
---
Let's not forget the increased latency and low framerates of 40 mans back then.  Today with faster internet and no lag, fights won't be so hard.
---
Plus it's easier to learn fights, with better selections of youtube videos.  Youtube explanations were not common in vanilla -&gt; tbc, good videos were a godsend.  I still remember the flash game for learning shade of akama, and getting so good i could help weaker raid members clear their ghosts since I could do it so fast.  But now a youtube video can teach the slower members much faster.
---
On my server it was that way too. No one rolled need unless they could use it. Seems most of this need on everything is a private server thing.
---
Probably call out a bunch of the servers in discord and when my friends finally agree to one, that’s how I will choose a server.
---
and smoke lots of weed
---
&gt; So everyone can at least experience the story side of raids, even if they can barely play
---
Such a big mistake IMO.  A big part of what dragged me into hardcore raiding in the early days of WoW was wanting to be able to say "I saw the content" - felt like a real accomplishment and something to be proud about.  Doing a raid at mythic tier didn't feel better, and talking about it just felt like pointless dickwaving more than a real sense of having done more.
---
So if you're talking DM and the quelserrar book drops, everyone is free to roll on it then?
---
Different state is nothing. At least you share a continent. 
---
Tag me on the video post. :)
---
&gt;But if they were correct in their estimates they could just use static servers!
---
What.
---
We're both operating under the assumption that there (potentially) will be a sharp drop in players. Meaning dead or dying realms.
---
Classic will be bigger than Fortnite.
---
Layering and sharding are the same thing.  They just trying to call it something else to put a spin on it.  NPC and players pop in and out around you while playing the game.  Same thing.
---
Gf being ok watching trash on netflix...I’m banking on this or shopping for stuff on her phone. My computer desk is in the same room of the tv so that’s key
---
My guild officers will post the server choice on our discord.
---
Ye I wonder this too. I play on a laptop notebook and I've been playing pservers for quite some years on it, both vanilla and wotlk, without any problem. But recently I tried to log into my f2p character on retail and apparently my fps is really spiky and also my cpu gets really hot on medium-low settings.  
---
   
---
Hopefully this wont be an issue in Classic...
---
On the other hand, you don't have to redo everything at launch. That's why I stopped playing on something that shall not be named a while ago not to burn out :D
---
It doesn't give you an unfair advantage because any raid can get the buffs and any decent size group of pvpers can prevent any opposite faction raid from making into the raid with the buffs.
---
exactly huge release, then it will dwindle down to the the dedicated few that will sustain it
---
It is evidently still possible to do it by dying to fatigue in the ocean as a ghost first. This apparently moves your real corpse around even if done as a ghost. If you can use this trick to make the intended rez graveyard be the one nearest your corpse then you can do it. All this has been tested by mage powerlevelers who for a variety of reasons want to level their mages in darkshore.
---
&gt;I mean you can just ask for an invite to the layer with the battle.
---
And that's a massive problem for those who are against layering. It takes a lot of immersion out of the game.
---
These are really small temporary inconviniences that can be surpassed easily with a litle of that thing that vanilla is so renowned about .. socialization.
---
They may be small temporary inconveniences to you. And while I enjoy socializing with people, I don't always want to be grouped to participate in something. I used to join Redridge battles on my own on Nostalrius when people in world chat mentioned they needed help against the Horde.
---
Game. On. Motherfucker.
---
Are these not much worse than Warden Staff? If Warden Staff is the true BiS, why not just get it ASAP if you can afford it? Phase 2 is months out from launch.
---
You did say you were going to compare the games objectivley (facts, numbers, non-opinionated things) then immediately use the phrase "challenging epic journey" which is.....super subjective. Someone could say; I found classic easy, boring and short and they wouldn't be wrong, it's their opinion. 
---
Objectively comparing the games would be: price point, amount of items in the game, average hours played, how many levels, etc. 
---
Don't mean to flame you but...yeah.
---
&gt; So, in summary, just make more realms.
---
That's fine too, but I'm not suggesting that.
---
&gt; That's not happening. 
---
Of course it's not. Blizzard wants to keep their costs low, they don't care about doing things right. That doesn't mean it shouldn't happen.
---
&gt; The only reason to go with this is if people enjoy server mergers
---
No one enjoys them, but they are a significantly better option than layering. And when I say significant, I mean reeeeally significant. They aren't even in the same ballpark of acceptability.
---
I think that specific one was CritLine that came with Titan Panel but it was pretty buggy, there will be better ones for sure.
---
Stop acknowledging this is beaten to death and then continuing to beat it to death even further.
---
I'm almost certain the form of melee leeway on the beta isn't accurate. This is all from 9+ years of memory so take this with a grain of salt but I seem to remember leeway not affecting mobs, only PVP combat. You would gain +3 yards leeway, but only after entering 5 yard melee range would this leeway be added. So if you're chasing after a caster, you catch up to them and manage to make it into 5 yard melee range. You're able to melee them an extra few yards as they run from you. If you leave the 8 yard radius, this extended range is lost and you need to again re-enter the 5 yard zone. The idea was the leeway would help melee stick to casters who are kiting them, while not giving an unfair advantage. Think: you open on a mage and he frost novas and runs from you, the leeway gives you one extra melee attack just enough to finish him off. This was the concept that was in mind when designing this feature. It was never meant to flat out extend melee range by 3 yards. When you frost nova a mob they shouldn't be able to melee you if you're at max range. Right now on beta this is not possible.
---
Bagspace
---
Be careful, my original main in vanilla was a troll rogue, by level 60 I was so pissed I didn't roll undead. Gear looks goofy, stabbing animations look goofy. If you really love the troll then go troll, just my experience.
---
Hey, what platform were you listening on? That seems very odd, no one else has mentioned any issues so I’m not sure if it’s something on your end. Let me know, cheers.
---
You might have the same feelings about them but they are in reality not the same thing. Do some research into it instead of just listening to the circlejerk cries.
---
Are you me? Also, it was a lot of fun but I had to create a new account and character after it was apparent she was in it for the long haul.
---
That’s fine. You roll greed and I will give the flask of titans recipe to my alt or the guild’s alchemist if I win it. While you enjoy your reputation I will enjoy the taste of my flask.
---
I am in general a very nice person. But we are 10 people in the UBRS. Chances are every person rolls need or a lot do. Nobody can tell who is an alchemist or who isn’t so it makes really no point to think that way.
---
And I honor agreements. If you communicate this with me prior, then I will honor that agreement. Because I could not agree more with you: Your reputation is very important.
---
I hate ninja looters. It’s just that in a few cases the term is not clear. Every situation is different. I usually wait before I make a choice. And if the truefaith pattern drops and the priest promises he is a tailor, then I will pass it to him as long as he seems trustworthy to me and is not a total jackass. If the priest communicates his need on this BoE prior, I will always agree to it. And honor the agreement even if the priest is not trustworthy or a jackass.
---
my guild chooses the server.  it will be PvP because we are not a bunch of scrubby carebears
---
The warlock mount quests are also really cool.

You and me both. I'll re-roll if I see a single message in trade chat about where asmongold is

Some of the better quests, even if they’re a little slapsticky
---
Horde =  badass looking races and lore. Honor, glory. Lok'tar Oghar!  
---
Alliance = Rainbow happy friends that hate each other on their backs.
---
Same here. The guild leaders are making that call.
---
I was responding to someone saying no one brought mages to raids in TBC. Take your victim complex somewhere else.
---
This is the way to go. One mage needs to apply winter's chill. Their DPS is typically lower as a result of no AP cooldown.
---
I'd be surprised if they didn't fix world buffs for classic release.  It's far too exploit-y to be left in.
---
You two civilly arguing with facts and numbers has been great to witness :)  No name-calling, swearing, or passive-aggressiveness.  I learned new insight from this, too!
---
Anyway, carry on and thanks for being community people :)
---
I have seen no1 mention the flame elementall boss in BRD. You could disenchant the blues and sell on AH.
---
Having a guild before it's even out sounds excellent. Happy to hear the hype is high and tight-knit
---
Lol not a chance in hell
---
I want hope so. I really do.
---
what wotlk server
---
If you think a server with 3k cap and 15k players would have a 10-20 min queue...
---
Play Druid.  Maybe roll shaman after if you don’t like it. Druid OT is viable. Check out Skarm tank.
---
Plenty of people care, hence all the posts.
---
Layering sucks ass, period.
---
Server clusters are better in every way since you have a static realm and controlled populations.
---
That's a pretty good one not gonna lie lmao, but I can deal. So I guess it's lock for me
---
Yea endless hours of free promotion was a poor decision. No, you’ve got that wrong. The poor decision was not inviting more people period. Here’s to hoping for a short but sweet open beta.
---
Find out which ones are west coast servers and go from there I guess.
---
Alliance: Gnome (racials: expansive mind, escape artist). Horde: undead (racial: will of the forsaken).
---
 I personally played an Undead Mage in classic and loved the animations.
---
I read a really thorough guide the other day that could help.
---
[Mage DPS Guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-classic-wow)
---
That would ruin the best part of the game...

---
Yup, I've replied to so many posts here about layering.. submit or go back and they're deleted.
---
I don’t feel like you’re reading any of the posts responding to this thread.
---
Let me be as clear as possible: At level 30 and 40 casters are so much stronger that any advantage leeway may possibly give to melee is irrelevant.
---
Let’s say, hypothetically, melee are at a power level of 10 without leeway, and giving them leeway they are at a power level of 15.
---
Casters, comparatively, would be at power level 50. The +5 from leeway doesn’t matter. It’s a huge gap.
---
The recommended PVP server. Otherwise RPPVP servers If they exist.
---
If WoW classic plus becomes a thing, simply adding Karazhan but tuned to level 60 (and maybe a 20 man?) I think would pop many boners.
---
That's the thing about WoW Classic: it's going to bring back a lot of us who have long since quit wow but have been playing together as far back as the 90s.  And it's not like we're old fogeys. I'm 34. I just started playing MMOs when I was in elementary school and basically have been playing with the same people I met online in middle school. The hype is definitely high amongst the long-time, tight-knit.
---
I'm not in the no changes crowd, and I think this particular issue has really put a harsh light on what that no changes even means. I think at it's core we all want the experience/spirit of vanilla even if we disagree on the implementation of achieving that.  
---
I think we all agree there is some intangible thing that embodies what vanilla wow was, and I don't think spell batching or leeway will improve our enjoyment of that thing. So, like everyone else I'm not a fan of spell batching or leeway. But in general, I want people to critically think about how many other things they previously shot down because they were "changes". Consider the game and experience as a whole, and perhaps be more open minded about them because these effects show that sticking to the letter of vanilla isn't always correct.
---
&gt;And that's a massive problem for those who are against layering. It takes a lot of immersion out of the game.
---
I believe "massive" is a bit of an overstatement given that layering is temporary. I would agree with you if it was permanent tho'. 
---
However If you want to keep immersion think of it as asking for a summon.
---
And if you want o be solo you can leave group after you are summoned.
---
It's really not a problem.
---
Pfft if it was strong it'd be in smaller bottles. Those furballs wouldn't last in Canada
---
What do you not understand? Your posts and comments get downvoted. Posts saying you are wrong get upvoted. 
---
Layering sucks, but it’s better than clusters and anything you suggested. 
---
The number of people caring and posting is irrelevant when it’s all the same garbage solutions that would be worse than the current design.
---
Stop. Posting. The. Same. Bullshit.
---
Was not a warlock in Vanilla, I was a druid, but I can confirm farming these guys was instrumental to making me a wealthy individual on my server. The eyes had a decent drop rate too.

---
lol at the downvotes.  I see lots of people saying im wrong, no one actually giving a reason why though.
---
Yeah lol the wpvp from it is great, can become a world class salt miner.  Just don't think being able to accelerate content so much will be good for raiding
---
Wait, there's no pvp/tank hunter spec?
---
Why do you worry how long it takes to reach max level with limited time if your time does not allow for max level content? Enjoy the road to 60 and be glad it takes a while.
---
And that's how you get carpal, kids.  I know from vanilla experience.
---
Thats cool.
---
Makes a lot less sense though than 4 people losing 100+ gold to a random rather than doing the normal tbing and all rolling need thus eliminating the problem before it happens.
---
Yep, always timestamped :)
---
This is not true. Until WoTLK it was possible to script (using a lua unlocker) stopcasting into SPELL\_CAST\_SUCCESS, since there was delay between SPELL\_CAST\_SUCCESS and SPELL\_CAST\_APPLIED.
---
Half of these clips were during the first days and during the first stress test. That video is worth nothing...
---
The guild actually disbanded shortly after Christmas holiday and i quit myself slightly before that happened, cus I had already cleared all the content earlier as a cat dps on the previous server and wanted to save my energy for Classic.
---
It was nice to be able to raid BWL for the first time with every single world buff, including WCB as well, and had pretty good results. I never got proper loot there though, so I was playing with half green half blue gear, but at the time when world buffs were enabled in BWL i was #9 of all the rogues on the server on my druid, competing against the rogues with all the items from MC and whatever they had time to gather from BWL during the month before world buffs were enabled.
---
Victim complex?  I'm not the one spouting off blatantly incorrect information.
---
Take your projection somewhere else.
---
You are mis-remembering. Frozen Shadoweave tailoring set made Warlocks and Spriests godmode for season 1 until other classes got their drops.
---
Even better than I thought (me not gud at number)
---
Paladin: Avoid letting salv and kings fall off me for the duration of the raid. FOR ONCE.
---
I hate the idea of layering in Classic but this is one of the stupidest ideas I've seen to fix it to date.  You just invented separate servers that get merged later, essentially having no layering.  Actually I take it back, it is a good idea.
---
heh, thats kinda why i cited when blizz put them into the original world.   
---
The argument being that even blizz thought these changes helped base azeroth.
---
I still enjoy playing Ark a lot and I'll keep playing that alongside Classic.
---
Also Classic doesn't give me that "Epic Single Player" story feeling, ever, since I'm playing WoW for community stuff, so I still really enjoy good single player games.  Guess I don't feel the same way :P.
---
Not sure if RE games were ever up your alley or not be REmake2 was absolutely fantastic and you should try it.
---
LOL same dude. The only excitement I can find from games is if I play some CS:GO matches and get matched up against some skilled LE or LEM ranked players. I come home everyday after work and much like everyone else, clean the house, do the laundry, and watch Youtube videos about Classic. Yard looks nice and I'm slowly running out of things I am interested in watching on streaming platforms. /firstworldproblems

I loved Legion. So. Fucking. Much. I fell in love with the game again, I played from start to finish and with like 8 characters, trying to do as much content as I can. It was the most fun I had since vanilla.
---
I know it's not vanilla...the design philosophy etc. is different. But it was full of fun content. Artifacts were such a great idea (and I know, RNG legendaries were a bad one) , the entire game revolved around the artifacts. And some were very cool with kickass backstories. 
---
Legion rewarded you with something every step of the play. AP, Legendaries, Weapon skins...There was so much to do. Especially the weapon skins. I hunted weapon skins like crazy. The dungeon ones, the raid ones, pvp ones...I did all I could. It was so fun to collect stuff, I loved matching artifact skins to sets.
---
M+ was sooooo much fun. If I had nothing to do I would do a couple M+. Dungeons were nice and well designed, with a ton of strong lore. Wardens, Nightmare, Valkyr, Vrykul, Old Gods, Legion...even the fucking Deathwing was there. Affixes were rough in some weeks but overall, it was fun to push keys.
---
But most important of them all: Legion made you feel cool AND powerful. The weapons had pretty cool traits that made the classes really fun. My favourite example is the Resto trait that dropped a healing totem when you casted Riptide. It wasn't much, but damn it did make me feel like a Shammy! Even some legendaries had unbelievably kickass effects. The X'anshi cloak for Holy and the Shard of Exodar for Mage are two good examples. It was fucking awesome to burn another bloodlust for some sick dps, and having an oh shit button as Holy Priest made you feel extremely powerful.
---
Then BfA released. It shat all over it. The classes sucked ass since they did not replace FOUR game systems (Artifacts, Legendaries, Netherlight Crucible and the Class Sets) after removing them. And that was basically enough to turn me off once again from the game. How they managed to fuck it up this time must be taught in schools or something, because it such a spectacular failure imo.
---
WoW literally does not need "free promotion". It was a bad call. But whatever.
---
There's also no need for open beta. I'm not even convinced those are a good idea, because people don't beta test. They play the game to get a quick fix. That's not as valuable data as it might seem to be.
---
Three hours... I'm excited
---
You also assumed I’m a kid yet you make a post talking down to me? Do you talk down to kids often? Thats some psychopath shit. Sorry your dad wasn’t proud of you.
---
But the dots don't tag the mob until they do damage. In high traffic areas it's tough for a lock to tag mobs.

Casual content is more plentiful in vanilla than bfa

Thought it was more than 24, the other ones are 24 like essences. So yeah it will be a lot of gold off the bat to get that LHH.

No one cares about the broader MMO audience, they aren't who Classic is being developed for.  Not to mention MMOs as a genre have for a long time now been usurped from their popularity throne.

If I have to, I will tune into Classic streams and then /who and make sure not to be on those servers. I will find a way. I'm not going to have this game ruined by a bunch of people looking to make a quick buck and their zombie hordes.
---
&gt; 10-20min queue 
---
Hahaha, you weren't around for TBC or Wrath launches were you.
---
As someone who played an Human Lock, yeah I kinda wish I went Horde. But I also was constantly in BGs instead of raiding. If your main endgame goal is raiding, then I wouldn't worry about it. Don't get me wrong, there a plenty of other ways to get around WotF, it just complicates things. Pvping on an alliance lock is very doable, its just annoying.
---
I  like the time zone idea. Thanks

Resist gear will still be absolutely necessary for the raids it was before.

The picture you linked says the code checks if both people are players meaning leeway in vanilla did not apply to mobs.

Unless you're a no-lifer rushing to 60 as fast as possible, this won't be an issue.

Wait a minute. Now I even feel like a noob.  Didn't /sit always activate stuff like reckoning? Hell, I've seen people talking about it everywhere and didn't give it a second thought until I saw this.
---
Hey... No worries, my pleasure!
---
Regarding the human paladins there should be an aim for 5% hit when sword/mace is BiS. This has been discussed before and from what I understand the racial will cover 1 % hit. That is crazy OP in it self. Giving them 3 would destroy all other races. When axes are BiS they will have 6 % like dwarves.
---
I decided to use Terazan instead of Onslaught because of Onslaught being BiS for warriors throughout the whole game and only one phase for rets.
---
Afaik the trinkets do scale with spell DMG. Proccrates may be horrible, which is something that has to be found out when retail hits.
---
Being killed by a mob 12 yards away is a very bad experience and should not be in classic. Based on video evidence it is pretty clear that in PvE Mobs did not have that long yards melee range.
---
Blizzard is making a huge error in adding "Lag Simulation". This is not what people come to classic for. The majority of players will take good responsive gameplay over lag simulation any day.
---
I vote for responsiveness and competitive balance over "hey this feels like im playing on a 56kmodem"
---
Look around at the other mmorpgs, you have final fantasy, and elder scrolls online. That's it. WoW will never be a niche market. Any other fantastical predictions you care to share with us?
---
I've been playing all beta, played all AV weekend, and fiddled around on the stress tests since the Beta servers were down.
---
I don't mind it at all. Playing a Hunter and a Mage when it goes live. If there's less ranged because people are worried about this, then let there be. /shrug
---
But Im of the opinion that there was always going to be a few boogeymen. This is just how it works. There were always going to be things people worried to death about.

it mostly helps a guild farm the raids faster.  people tend to die too much on progression to keep the wbuffs.

I don't think it is as long as you have the flight to Southshore. If not then you're walking from Menethil Harbor to get the FP at Refuge Point, Arathi Highlands. Arathi to Southshore FP. Then from Southshore you brave the road to Eastern Plaguelands to get that FP. Now you have all the FP's to get as close as you're going to get. From EPL stay left and swim across the pond to get to Tirisfal Glades and avoid the high level bears and spiders. Once you're in Tirisfal Glades you're home free unless there are Horde there looking to kill Alliance.  
---
So after writing all that I change my mind. It's a pain in the ass to get there, but it's worth it.
---
I don't know who you are. Or whether you're a man or a woman. I may never see you or cry with you or get drunk with you. But I love you. I hope that you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better, and that one day people have roses again. I wish I could kiss you.

!remindme in 1 year. I can't wait to tell you how wrong you are.

not true.  people are less reliant on resistance gear as they were in retail vanilla

I leveled one of the new allied races back at the end of Legion, and it both had its pros and cons. It was basically the system they’d used for Legion leveling, where it was a kinda smart move, so you didn’t have everyone start the expansion in the same zone. 
---
The pros were that you got to play out the zones you wanted. Zones didn’t really become obsolete, which was good, since I basically got level 20 to ~35 (iirc) done just in Hillsbrad. 
---
The cons were that I didn’t *feel* my character get stronger. Sure, my numbers grew very steadily, but I was so freakishly overpowered anyway. All of my gear was either heirlooms or rares/epics that were decently level-appropriate, even if I almost never did dungeons. I played a rogue, so I couldn’t solo 5-man group quests (the ONE I came across) - but I still had an ability called Crimson Vial, which was basically the health potion straight outta Diablo. Healing like 40% of my health over a few seconds for no cost at a 30 sec cooldown. Nothing could stand in my way, it was absurd.

So...which part about my statement is incorrect?
---
You get the nochanges vanilla experience you always wanted with hour long queue times to play the game. Hehe.
---
In reality they will most likely offer free server transfers like they did back then. Nobody wants to pay for a game that's unplayable due to overcrowding.
---
Do you have evidence of that?
---
Sorta, you have to sneak into the zone to complete the quest at which point you can just pickup the FP. Cool quest if you like collecting keys but not necessary at all.
---
Every time in whatever Inn was near me. /yawn /sleep
---
your tanks will need fire resistance gear for some fights (rag and firemaw. not sure if there is one i am missing) and i know some melee who use fire resistance on firemaw.
---
melee will need nature resistance for aq40 (huhu soakers)

the entire raid will use frost resistance for saph and KT in naxx

I'm in the process of buying a squat rack, incline bench and a 300lbs Olympic bar bell set. It'll be set up in my basement next to my computer. Hopefully I'll be able to sneak in some reps on flights and shit

Such a cool quest. She doesn't even trust you when you bring back proof of killing the elite. Sends you off to have it verified IIRC. What a mean dwarf.
---
I did this every time :D
---
What are you comparing this to? Let me guess, private servers? 
---
...Where the numbers are made up and resistances don't matter? (Yes that's a who's line joke)
---
Snutz may have won but 2-4 were all Spriests
---
No harm done and no offense taken.. Here I was thinking I had had some great big brainfart too. It can get a bit heated. Aand I noticed the edits, now let's see if I can make some quotes work:
---
&gt; You get this with Layering every day, that's what I've tried to get you to understand.
---
I do understand this, but okay, the way I see this is kind of.. Let's say the new people you meet is a constant thing throughout the time layering is active. It's a river. You'll also meet the same people too unless RNG or whatever really hates you. The important part is that it's somewhat constant, the ratio of new people/old people you run into should remain about the same, with running into old people increasing constantly as you meet more people and layers decrease.
---
Now with a merge it's a really this huge sudden flood. The imagery might not be entirely accurate but it's how I kind of see this.I'd really be interested if you do have a different view on this or if not why'd you think the kind of sudden flood would be better.
---
Now, why I to some degree think that layering wins here is a combination of factors. Some probably psychological. I tear bandaids slowly too. But I prefer the constancy, for me layering would only be active mainly during the time I level, which is a time you meet new people constantly since people already level at different paces. Do different zones at different levels. So adding in an extra factor to that doesn't feel quite as bad to me.
---
&gt;People have the choice to play on high pop servers. We shouldn't alter the game because of streamers!
---
Very much so, that point was admitting you do have a point in the problems of determining a player cap especially given that there will be these outlier servers. But yeah. After it's done, you roll in high-pop, that's your problem, you know or should know what that entails.
---
"Smallish" in terms of WoW might as well be "gigantic" in other games terms.
---
Having over a million active monthly subscribers would be fantastic for any other subscription based online game, but that is considered *bad* for WoW.
---
Now I'm not going to presume to know how many subs will come back purely for Classic, but we're definitely going to see a spike in overall subs (I doubt Blizzard will differentiate retail vs Classic playtime) after August 27th.
---
My favourite reply in quite some time haha well played!

Lol. One of the biggest fights we ever had was when I thought she stole my mining node afterimage died trying to get it. Lol
---
The issue with that mod in later patches was you had raids or other circumstances/buffs that would let you do insane amount of damage with your normal skills :/
---
So youre not allowed to get bored of a beta that gets wiped in a few weeks and your progress doesn't save, and you've been playing at level 40 for 2 months. Ok, realize how stupid you sound.

So I'm a bit unfamiliar with vanilla warlocks, how does enslave demon help you kill demons?
---
I’ll check it out, often times like these it is something on your end so try giving it another go or on another platform, sorry it did that!
---
Yup. Unless there's some other arrangement, it's fair game as a BoE item.
---
BRs are notorious for being bad at video games, this doesn't bother me. More free honor.
---
people substitute fire resistance gear with fire protection potions. more dps and thousands of damage points absorbed.  
---
which fights do you think require resistance gear that differ from the comment i made in this section?
---
As a tank who will be running TONS of dungeons, I will not be deviating from the standard need-if-need. But of course you must be able to use use it immediately, then and there. Equip a weapon. Learn the pattern/schematic, etc.
---
I'm not going to *be* a ninja to prevent ninjas. I don't care how much the item is worth. Someone in the group MAY want to use that item. Someone might be running the dungeon specifically for it.
---
Ninjas will be dealt with in a much more effective fashion now days, by documenting their behavior and posting in the appropriate Discords/forums.
---
My friend is going warrior, and I've decided to be one of the three healing classes (Horde).
---
\- Shadow Priest

\- Ench shm
---
\- some form of druid

Can all 3 heal dungeons well, even if not resto/holy specced?
---
Any suggestions as to which is the most fun "pocket healer" to play?
---
we are now the houseman, hurray emancipatiom HURRAY
---
Minion Masters is a great F2P Steam game I've been playing. It's not P2W, doesn't require a huge time investment to be competitive, but is endlessly replayable and addictive.
---
We want him to return for classic tho, not disappear forever.
---
Druids could solo the idol boss in BRD pretty easy so I don't think it's impossible to do most/all of it with the right gear.
---
i listed the fights that require resistance gear in my other comment.  go check it out and tell me what you disagree with
---
I mean the default is to roll need on boes.
---
You don't have to make it clear because that is what is expected.

Wasnt this beta though? And nerfed in retail so you couldnt have negative resists.

do you log on to find all your gold gone because she needed to go shopping for things?
---
You enslave a powerful demon and then use it to kill other powerful demons.
---
Never finished doing this sinse vanilla times.
---
That's why I'm not looking for a guild now. I won't follow if they choose a streamer infested cesspool.
---
In terms of these issues though, I think a problem with arguing for "keep it close to your experience, not the technically correct values" runs into an issue where people had different experiences back then. Some people had slower connections and never saw the issues this caused, or we pretty much expected this level of responsiveness from MMOs and hadn't been spoiled by modern ones yet. Others had good solid connections and actually remember these behaviors. When people said hamstring kiting was harder in the Beta, I tried it myself on there. It didn't feel any more difficult for me now then it did back then. I always remembered being several yards (never measured the exact yards) away and getting hit or dazed. So changing it modern fidelity changes how the game will feel for me from my recollection, which is also in-line with the technical details.
---
So we get into arguments about who had good connections v bad and what was the percentage? And what was the average? What could we expect from network performance from 2004-2006? And at the end I just think if we are debating about whether we should preserve the experiences of people who had slow connections, versus those who had fast connections, then we should just leave it alone and keep it as is. Either way we're gonna be altering someone's experience, so just leave it alone. 
---
Now if the argument is instead "It just feels better to increase the responsiveness" that's a different debate premise (just heading off whoever wants to go there, I don't mind I just want to be clear what I'm responding to).
---
My guild is intending to have MC 100% down by Saturday night.
---
Your comment is fine but you are contradicting yourself. I say resistance gear will be necessary, you say no it’s not, then you proceed to list the fights it is necessary. 🤔
---
Now that's going into the cringe collection
---
And then you release yours when it’s 1 shadowburn away from death
---
It’s cute in a Vera Bradley kind of way
---
week 2 is for casuals, the speed runners will be aiming for 1
---
Yea, not sure starting on retail is a good idea if the plan is classic. Early on it's probably not bad (&lt;lvl10), but the little differences could confuse. The two games feel so different. Wait for it, so close.
---
I mean, if it lets a guild clear easier content faster so they can spend more time on progression content, it still helps progression.  IMO still an exploit..
---
People are more skilled today than they were in 2004 at RPGs/WoW specifically but that doesn't matter because alot of that skill is 'excess' or 'overkill' skill for vanilla. That excess skill won't all be used because there are fewer mechanics at play. It especially won't be used to negate the need for resistance gear as most of the damage you need resistance gear to mitigate is unavoidable damage.
---
General skill being higher will slightly improve the MC/Ony/BWL/ZG experience but it'll stop there.
---
The guilds that were in AQ 40 and Naxx, the raids where many guilds turned to requiring resistance sets for the entire raid, had 30-40 highly skilled players in every raid back in vanilla. Their healers won't be so much better today in classic that they can heal through 10-100s of thousands more damage in encounters.
---
Good point. Would 2h furry work? I'm mostly trying to avoid competing with a billion rogues and warriors for 1h swords.
---
well my guild is pretty anti streamer so I am guessing that they will be avoided at all costs
---
And then someone walks in and needs on the 1k gold boe epic.
---
Gz you just lot your epic mount.
---
I think only some fights. I remember even in Vanilla we used as little resistance gear as possible to do more damage on fights like ragnaros. We supplemented resistance gear with fire protection potions. I imagine it'll likely be the same, perhaps even less reliant on resistance gear.
---
Play lock, there really isnt any good mage spec for both untill fore becomes viable
---
No o e can tell if you're an alchemist, but we can tell if you get the recipe, you're expected to learn it then and there. So no need rolling on recipes that are too high level, and you can't learn yet. Because then you could definitely sell that. So you would need to roll greed.
---
Keeps people honest.
---
They have classic planned. Maybe TBC and wrath. This questions gets asked too much.
---
Look for the classic + sub.
---
Obligatory I'm not in the beta but from what I've seen...
---
Why would you EVER want this? Imagine if there was a poll on adding it into current wow? Do you think over 2% would say yes? 
---
It feels so terrible and unnatural. It's artificial lag. It's being added just cause "it was in vanilla lol".
---
I'd be glad if it was removed entirely but at the very least, tone it way the fuck down. Cut the batching to 100ms, leeway to 0.75 yards.
---
Blasted Lands while leveling. By far my least favorite zone to level in. The zone itself isn't bad. Kazzak and the Dark Portal are cool parts of it. But the quests to grind meats for consumes gets really old after doing them a few times.
---
I don't think this thread is going to go as you intended it to. 
---
Personally, I hope they release BC (I think this has been somewhat confirmed?) but release it with classicesque changes. IE, no flying mounts, no dailies, ect.
---
Ill be very happy if im wrong
---
2 months is long enough to launch! Just don't press keep playing after that....if you can
---
Even-though spell batching and leeway are exactly as they were in 2004, I'm somewhat worried modern internet speed will break that mechanic.
---
Back then it was common for players to have higher ms than they do now, some played regularly without ever seeing that green coloured bar, and it was precisely because of that higher ping that melee leeway and spell batching functioned correctly.
---
These days players have substantially lower ping and the vast majority of players have green ping , while some have almost no delay at all with single digit pings , this is why both of these vanilla mechanics need to be altered accordingly to match the accelerated ping, maybe halving the time and distance for both spell batching and leeway respectively.
---
Nah it was no accident, they just have very different people in charge now. Remember that they merged with Activision in 2008. Half a year later, we get Wrath of the Lich King, an expansion that utterly fucks everything up.
---
No I always stole from her. Ha ha
---
Your keybindings confuse me
---
You know what people with almost two decades experience in online releases do when they have an upcomig release?
---
They prepare for it. They look at the past an learn from their mistakes. To prepare nothing, to change nothing, to learn nothing from the release 15 years ago is, as you aptly put it, a setup for failure.
---
then roll for class too?
---
But what you were suggesting is that they are guessing too high, which we have no information about.
---
Depends on the raid. You can get by without FR for most of MC if your tanks and melee use Fire Protection Pots, but at the very least, having FR gear on Rag will make it a lot easier.
---
Who suggests Tauren warrior to a guy who has only been a Gnome warlock?
---
Sounds like a moo point.
---
You finish that LASO run yet?
---
I guess it's your choice to not agree. But if you need toll on something you can't use immediately (and prove it), in my group... then YOU are the ninja. And I will screenshot/document the incident, and then plaster it all over the applicable Discords/forums. 
---
What you're describing is LITERALLY the purpose of a greed roll.
---
I’m positive LFR has mechanics that if one person fucks up can wipe an entire raid to this day.
---
48hr
---
The plan is to make money.
---
it's going to be a disaster. 2 months after servers will suffer from inbalance and broken economies.
---
i'll stick to private servers. can you retailers tell all the Hardcore Classic raiders. Our data is shit, made up and bad. Please stop requiring your guilds to log on to your own private to guarantee your day 1 clear.
---
What are you talking about? NE rogue is legit the worst Rogue option you can pick on alliance. Goes Gnome &gt; Dwarf &gt; Human &gt; Nightelf
---
Not necessarily. We can't say for sure anything about lvl 60 pickpocketing based on comparisons between lvl 40 pickpocketing in the beta and on private servers.
---
What I do however see are old videos from real vanilla, of Rogues making great profit doing pickpocketing runs in dungeons. If Classic is different, then there are some bugs Blizzard needs to fix to make it more like real vanilla. Because Rogues sure as hell got a LOT of Rogues Diaries from pickpocketing back then, and each sold for 50s at a vendor.
---
Why. There is a literally a layering discussion posted by the mods for the next four days, and people still keep posting this stuff,
---
Why does it have to last forever?
---
Time zone for me for sure since I’m west coast and mostly late night
---
What's your point though
---
pro move to have a level 5 bank alt that disenchants your boe
---
Are rolling ignites not the be all in AQ forward anymore? Honest question. Don't know if different things were discovered since the original progression.
---
2real4me.
---
Lost my virginity to one of the mages in guild. I was a class lead, she was not - so she wasn't in on loot council. But, she heard that I voted against her getting Neltharion's Tear (loot council) and it caused a huge dust-up. She ended up leaving the guild and quitting, for at least a few months.
---
Ironically she requested to be my realid friend a few weeks back, presumably to play together again in classic, and I declined. Told my wife about it, who just said "wow you're a fucking nerd".
---
Stack on the surgers in MC
---
Not class specific, but fuck its annoying
---
Oof
---
Ha ha ha ha
---
demonic rune farming for casters as well
---
Saw her mouse clicking abilities during raids. No more raids. Also no more girlfriend. Totally unrelated though.
---
how do i forget the lock tanks when i am the lock tank. lol...
---
i dont use nr for visc.  it doesnt hurt though.
---
Def. think WF is better for the extra rage for warriors. Other than that I don't think the damage difference would be much different. But the rage from WF really adds up to a lot of extra abilities. So in a non warrior group it might work out for the better, though even rogues get extra poison applies from WF, so prob. not.
---
This isn’t a recruitment post.
---
I don't really care to be honest, I will be playing to talk to people, level, do some dungeons and maybe some raids if I don't lose interest.
---
From what I've seen from the Classic devs they are doing a wonderful job and I'm accepting whatever way they decide to go with.
---
This is the correct answer. All other answers I've read are just discussing specs in general or PvE vs pvp
---
It's worth noting that Paladins require something like half the amount of int per crit compared to the cloth casters (I usually see people say a little less than 30 int per crit versus around 60 for cloth casters). So about every 30 int is going to give you an extra percent chance to crit anyway.
---
I've played wow with gamepad and it's fun, don't expect to be able to do every little thing but the leveling experience and gathering are really more immersive because you are chilled in the couch.
---
I played too much back then to get a girlfriend. Now I am just too angry and drunk to get a girlfriend.
---
Mists was actually an extremely good expansion that was, unfortunately, wrapped in a world setting that many people couldnt get past in order to see the good that had actually been done. Thats not criticism either, taste is subjective.
---
Mists was actually the era where I feel that gameplay was at its most fun. Classes felt powerful and complex, but not overwhelming. The world was well designed and the story delivery was well executed... IF, you enjoyed it. And thats the problem, the IF. If Mists had been mechanically identical but wrapped up into almost any other world and plot setting it would have been universally regarded as the best expansion ever made.
---
It’s all to do with how often command procs. You see, the slower the weapon, the less swings you do which increases the chance it will proc because it has to proc say 5 times per minute (I think it’s 5 but could be 7). If you are using a faster weapon then that is many more swings where it won’t proc which makes crusader better. 
---
So for shit wording
---
melee will need nature resistance for huhu in aq40 (soakers)
---
was my comment on resistances.  i forgot to add 2 warlocks need some shadow resistance for twin emps and you can use it for visc but its not necessary so i didnt list it.
---
i raided both retail vanilla and on pservers.
---
Did you even read what I said? 
---
LFG Monday is also for people looking for guilds. Do you think every person looking for a guild should make their own post about it? Or does it make more sense for them to...wait for it...check the LFG Monday post to see what guilds are recruiting.
---
All perfect examples of why retails is trash...They should just port it over to ps4/xbox and be done with it.
---
I feel like it might be best to hit 60 and then join the most established guild with the most 60s.
---
Iirc most guides of time suggested ~100 nature resist + hunters/shamans ot so to reduce damage.
---
Its really easy. This is how it worked. You can inspect people. If someone need rolled a boe, they were expected to equip it immediately.  If they refuse to. Then they just want to sell it and they are a NINJA LOOTER.
---
Wow arena has one of the highest skill floors in any game. Its an extremely complicated equation that demands it be answered immediately or you die. It was always something i admired in others, but i mever put in the time to react to all the different classes and mechanics.
---
r/suddenlygay
---
There actually ARE undead there - skeletons and ghosts, in a canyon to the south. And a quest to kill .. 40? of those ghosts. There's also a fanatical cleric at Nigels Point trying to recruit you to the great cause of scarlet crusade, who offers that quest I think.
---
I like felwood because of all the world buffs
---
I mean, it's better for most of the people that play the game. People who leave the game aren't still lumped in with the "most" category. Scaling got a very warm reception, just like heirloom and not having to go to a trainer. The biggest things that have had impacts on the playerbase were talents being removed, and the story of some of the xpacs. A lot of QoL changes were just that.
---
Those are xpacs.  Overwatch and HS are not Triple A

Lionheart should be in phase 1, but the pattern drops off raid bosses, so it’ll take a bit before it’s available.
---
&gt;Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other’s original location.
---
&gt;We think it’ll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.
---
If that's Blizzard's reasoning for keeping a large batching window, that's pretty pathetic. Yeah, it'll be good for a laugh the *First* time you see it, but then it's going to get really old, and really frustrating. It's funny to see mobs in Everquest roar over hills and clip through just about every object to get to you - once - then it just makes the game look unpolished and janky. These sorts of "fun" designs are only going to make the game feel clunky and outdated. Once the PVP patch hits, or if not before, I believe we'll see batching reduced because we'll all have had our fair share of laughs and giggles courtesy of Blizz for wanting to keep a feature meant for decade old technology.
---
Ok, I’m done with this.
---
To summarize:
---
A. you are saying I am in fact right, resistance gear will be required.
---
B. Your estimations for NOT needing gear come from private servers, which are inaccurate.
---
Good talk.
---
I don't think it is going to be 400g, tbh. The demand is from the least played class in the game. I'd be shocked to see it at 100g or more. 
---
Also, who cares if someone "no life's" it? I can play a game 7 hours a day / 5 days a week and still have my full time job and a social life. Some people get home from work and plop in front of the TV the rest of the night and no one really bats an eyelash. I'll still have my weekends.
---
Nope, we are talking 2hand weapons here. Crusader&gt;righteousness
---
Bro you are not ready for classic at all. Lucky for you there is still time to get your life priorities in order!
---
Some decide not to follow the beaten path and march into the unknown to the beat of their own drum!
---
I'm not sure when they removed it but I even have screens in ZG with vulnerability so it took a while. Most have forgotten about this being a thing or straight up never knew so I thought it was interesting to post.
---
Yeah if an expensive BoE drops - needing that shit. 
---
Too many times I’ve seen some warrior roll need and claim they equip and I see that shit on the AH not 2 hours later.
---
Killing the ogres in dead wind pass is pretty viable, lots of cloth and items to vendor. Plus, they drop the +9 str to bracer enchant which will always sell for a lot
---
I doubt it will be very interesting with layering turned on. And by time its gone, most won't care.
---
I don't think you even read the post
---
No. I will not become a ninja looter, to prevent ninja looting. 
---
Ninja looters will be branded as such, and evidence of their deeds plastered all over discords/forums.
---
If you do what you described, above, then *you* are the ninja looter. And evidence if your deed will be plastered all over discords/forums.
---
It's impressive how dedicated you are to that disconnect from reality.
---
Same here, but I was still playing cs 1.6 due to being poor haha. I'm thinking the guy above me must have played on a low pop server, or at least not on one of the top servers. Illidan was a complete shitshow around 6pm EST most days.
---
I already have a guild from playing on pservers that I enjoy playing with. Theyre not the sweatiest neckbeards but we've decided to at least try for server first. I i feel like I am the only 60 i might do the 1st raid reset with another guild. 
---
Your approach is great though, that was my original idea aswell
---
to summarize...you struggle with reading comprehension and haven't provided any substance to this conversation
---
Yeah iirc it was pvp target negatives that was removed my bad.  that was nerfed in last phase of beta.

I remember seriously wanting to die doing all of them in Nagrand. Thank God it was in one of the most beautiful zones or I may have just said screw it.
---
You would. It all depends on every person, and how much you're eating. It doesn't matter if you're eating 1600 calories of Twinkies or 1600 calories of lean meat. If you personally have maintenance (stay the same weight) above 1600, you will lose weight. The bigger the gap between how much you eat and your maintenance calories, the more weight you lose. 
---
Working out increases this gap, but not much. Of course working out is good, but you will only burn a few hundred calories with a solid one-two hour workout. That's just 1 candy bar. Likewise if you started working out, but started eating 5 candy bars more a day than you usually do, or an extra cheeseburger, you will gain weight. Some muscle because you're working out, but some fat. 
---
Working out can't possibly outwork a diet, it's just used to supplement it and for muscle gain. Hope this helps.
---
I hated Desolace on Alliance, but really liked it on Horde.

---
Hire me to act like your dad to check to see if you’re asleep in the middle of the night. Keep you on your toes.
---
&gt;but if arguing for no changes means there will be changes to some others' experiences, then the other side of the argument falls apart too.
---
Eh, not the way I see it. Making the change requires answering many questions, leaving it alone requires none and leaves it the same for people who already had good connections back then (and I would say that's not an insignificant number, many people willing to shell out $15/month for an MMO likely had decent connections). 
---
If you go ahead with the change you have to determine:
---
How do we change it? To what extent? What window should we aim for? What feels good, but also feels Classic? What did that mean for most people? Do we have to measure that retroactively? 
---
And then you have to consider any bugs or interaction conflicts that could arise from making the change. So overall if you are torn between two options, go with the simpler one. 
---
Then if you do consider the other side also asking for changes like guild banks, again I go back to "Are there complications there, and is it in-line with our goals?" Both questions are much simpler there. There would be complications to shoving a guild bank into Classic buildings, and it is not in-line with the goal of reproducing Classic. The leeway discussion is a much blurrier line in terms of what feels Classic, but is clear in what complications can occur, and how much effort would have to into tuning the new values (at least from the viewpoint of making those decisions, not implementing them).
---
Yes, and the reasons as to why are obvious.
---
&gt;Finishing is what you have to do. If you don't finish, nothing is worth a damn
---
WoW had nearly 13M active accounts in the same time, during Cataclysm. At that time, most of all classic players didn't even play the game anymore. We will be surprised.
---
Are u sure its removed? I did a mistake and it was pvp targets i meant before. Last phase of beta players couldnt have negative resists
---
Anyone who will be a leather worker should start refining deeprock salt ASAP (I think level 270 is when you can start). If you do nothing else on that character, just rip that cooldown. Cured Rugged Hide is such a bitch when it comes time to craft massive amounts of gear... Hide of the Wild takes 3 to make, which is 9 days of cooldowns. If you have 30 banked before you get the recipe, you can cash in pretty quickly.
---
Thisll create a weird divide. Normally with the introduction of a new expak people are able to get to the endgame relatively quickly. But can you imagine the power difference between these players, its gonna create an elitist meta, that i for one will be glad to be a part of.
---
#nolife
---
Cdew was able to get 39,000 xp/hour for level 35 in a random dungeon group with a enhance shaman and warlock. It's quite possible a good 3x mage group could sit on 45,000 - 50,000 xp/hour through the level 30s. That is absurdly fast xp, and with absolutely no competition or worries about being ganked, and the guild gets a warrior and healer power levelled as well.
---
Good point I didn't think about the rage. Do they not get rage from the flametongue damage? I honestly don't know. I was thinking about this in say, a group with a sword and board warrior, a rogue, and a hunter for example.
---
The best strategy is to get to level 60 before you go to Durotar.
---
I was like 99% sure they were about 50s in vanilla, and this is the price pretty much all database websites have listed for it, but I can't look at Rogue's Diary on archives of Thottbot or Allakhazam so I can't confirm it, unfortunately. So now, I'm only like 50% sure. A lot of Rogue mains from vanilla do remember it as around 50s though.
---
Either way, even if it's worth a lot less, you can make insane profit as a Rogue by farming those Arcanite Reaper plans. It's a 7% drop rate from an elite mob you can solo, worth very much. The nearby other elite has a 6% chance to drop Pattern: Robe of the Archmage for epic robes. So basically on average once every 15 runs you will make like a thousand gold. You can do one run each 12 minutes.
---
You can actually reenact the South Park episode!
---
Good luck and stay strong my friend.
---
I think I'm even more confused lol but whatever works for you!
---
It worked a lot like it does in the beta.  Due to lag you could repeatedly sit/stand and it would sometimes proc it. It was fixed in 2.0.1 to not proc at all due to /sit.
---
Then i remember it wrong, because of some weird settings on a private server. Sorry in this case.
---
Brilliant suggestion! This is exactly how I enjoy playing the game even to this day.
---
I plan on getting to sixty by end week 2/early week 3 (taking the week after off work to grind instead of launch). I haven't prepared anything to in-depth outside of class/professions I'm going to run. Focusing on making gold more than anything at the beginning and getting herblore as high as possible.
---
See you in STV! (hopefully)
---
You are extremely confused.
---
Then what's the point of layers? It server then and server merge again.
---
I'm convinced half of the active subs are just doing this instead of playing the game.
---
I just put up with it. All my friends and I played alliance Vanilla-WOTLK. Then we call quit, but they all joined back up right at the end of Cata (they didn’t quit for long) and rolled Horde. I got back into it in Legion and had no choice. I’m not happy about it at all but it is what it is. We’re rolling Alliance in Classic for max nostalgia and I can’t wait
---
&gt;The important part is that it's somewhat constant, the ratio of new people/old people you run into should remain about the same.
---
Actually this is where it's an issue.  Since layers are not static you have significantly reduced chance of repeat interaction.
---
So yes, you'll statistically have the same number of *encounters*, but those encounters are *extremely* unlikely to be with the same individuals, since odds are, either you or they switched layers since your last encounter by either logging off or joining a group, etc.
---
&gt;with running into old people increasing constantly as you meet more people and layers decrease
---
Well... Yeah. If there's no layers, no problem! ;).  But... with 2 layers you are 50% less likely to have a single repeat interaction with a player that you would have had otherwise.
---
&gt;which is a time you meet new people constantly since people already level at different paces.
---
This is actually kind of the problem.  You will still meet people... In fact, you'll *meet* more people.  You just won't see them again.  Ever.  Like you said, it's already rare to run into people multiple times, now you add layering in the mix, and that chance is decreased by a factor of how many existing layers there are.  (Of course, you *could* run into them again, it's just extremely unlikely).
---
It's the same problem retail has - its such a revolving door of people you psychologically don't attempt to create any lasting bonds.  When I join LFG, yeah, it's new people every time, but what's the point in talking to them?  I'll probably never see them again, and if I do, I won't recognize them in the sea of people I've played with in between.
---
Plus, there's so many things that are just stupid with Layering. "Anyone see the defias messenger?" " Uhhhh, what layer are you in?"
---
Someone gank your alt?  Well let me get my main.  Oh, I can't because when I relog I'm on a different layer.
---
Trying to get a battle started at Tarren Mill? Nah.  People just want to level.  They ask for invites and switch layers.
---
That's just random stuff off the top of my head, but surely you can see the implications.
---
Who needs quest helper if you remember 75% of quests and can vaguely remember another 20% . Amirite? Ha ha
---
Congrats you're a ninja looter. Everyone has alts they *want* things on. You're confusing (intentionally,  or unintentionally, I don't know which is worse) need with GREED. Want is greed. Need is **can and will immediately, on this character**.
---
Yup, and some people level up to max level killing only boars.  Some prefer slow, inefficient routes!  Nothing wrong with it, just offering advice to people who want leveling to be generally pleasant.
---
You can crunch the numbers if you want, but I don't see much reason to spec enhancement at all. Improved Weapon Totems has been shown to be an extremely minimal gain, and there's damn near nothing else in the enhancement tree that would benefit the group.
---
Whereas, the 1.12 resto tree for Shaman is exceptional.
---
i slept in the westfall inn or on the sawblade next to it
---
Yeah my p server is going Alliance which is what we did on K1 for hardcore raiding but now I’m ready to return to the horde which is what I did back in vanilla days.
---
I always had to do this. Just felt wierd not to. In fact I stil do this in every mmo I play
---
He obviously isnt looking for a guild or recruiting for one, just getting info of what other people plan on doing.
---
I recently got my wife into Wow, she now plays a lot more than me and hit 60 on a character and asked me what discord is and joined a guild to raid with.  It was better than I had hoped.  The thing that really hooked her was the social element.  So I would say, let her interact with people as much as possible.  In line with that my wife loves playing priest, mostly because buffing other players was an easy path to levelling in a party.
---
I have a playgroup that is in the same boat. There are 6 of us with jobs and/or families.
---
We only get 2 to 3 hours a few nights a week.  Maybe more if we plan ahead for a dungeon night.
---
It really is not a big deal and we still have fun everytime we play.  Classic leveling has a bad reputation of being long and that being bad.  This is because WoW leveling has been awful for a LONG time (thinking cataclysm) but leveling in Vanilla is much more of an adventure that you don't need to rush through.
---
That being said.  we all plan to take some PTO around release to get a bit of a headstart on those months it'll take to get to 60, maybe we can cut it down to 2-3 months from 6+.
---
You can’t enslave a demon if you have one summoned unfortunately
---
Even in a guild run that's not acceptable. That's a reason to make space for a better person.
---
Enslaved demons are the same as pets so you can't enslave while you have a pet out.
---
He edited it after I responded, did the same on the comment.
---
Since when did r/classicwow become filled with turds like you? GTFO. I played Classic on the day of release. Just because I didn’t do a specific dungeon you did or stopped playing after a certain expansion doesn’t mean shit.
---
Yeah apparently lol
---
Nah, it replaces your regularly summoned demon.
---
Pick one of the handful of EU PVP servers. I dunno.
---
Both of them seem wrong in some way. The batching is just blatantly way, way too much. The leeway shouldn’t work with mobs and shouldn’t work if one or both players are slowed. Seem like dreadfully easy fixes, but these people can’t even fix simple animations.
---
What are you talking about? Server cap in original vanilla wasnt bc the game was "designed that way" they have said it numerous times the only reason the servers were capped at 3k was bc of the available shitty hardware they had to run the servers with back in the day. The new server cap will be at least double probably more like triple.
---
No ChAnGeS 🤪🤪🥴🤠🤡🤡🤡😎😎
---
We were doing 2s in arena and she took her hand off of her mouse, reached across her keyboard, and died before she was able to press her divine shield ability.  The pettiest fight I instigated in my entire life.  But, she should have known better.
---
Who cares about that? Raids are such a minor and irrelevant aspect of the whole experience, it's only there so you can get amazing gear. Raids are nowhere near as important as world PvP and other stuff like that, which was ruined in TBC.
---
It’s more complicated than anything. Retail is excellent in a lot of ways, but completely disgusting in others. A lot of it boils down to bad design choices.
---
LFR, level scaling, leveling becoming pointless mechanically, titanforging system, artifacts and legendaries in general since wotlk, zones that aren’t sure if they’re designed for flying or walking, way too many raid difficulties, transmogrification, interesting cosmetics being put in cash shop and handed out like candy for easy tasks, removal of tier gear and unique appearances, titles becoming pointless flair, dungeons being relegated to diablo style mechanics, PvP being complete shit since arenas were introduced (probably the biggest flaw of BC), constant attempts at badge systems, trivializing all content that isn’t mythic, creating dungeon journals and fostering a community hell-bent on removing all mystery from entering a new zone or dungeon for the first time, removing master loot- the list goes on.
---
Really a lot of the game’s problems are traceable to Tom Chilton, Activision, Jay Wilson and so much of the Dev team coming from the disaster that was Diablo 3.
---
So much is great and incredible and... and so much just fucking sucks.
---
Probably end up as a DPS, but do a lot of tanking while leveling/level 60 dungeons.
---
Not at all how I remember it. Blizzard would offer free transfers from high pop servers to others, and people would refuse to do it because they wanted to stay on the high pop.
---
My first time leveling as a noob was 8 weeks calendar time on a Paladin.
---
Kirin Tor. Lower population RP server.
---
Exactly, it's far more fun trying to remember or having to figure out quest locations all over again.
---
&gt;What do you not understand? Your posts and comments get downvoted. 
---
I clearly do not give a fuck. Ironically, on the main layering thread, it's the opposite.  Anti-layering is upvoted, as is right and good.
---
&gt;Layering sucks, but it’s better than clusters and anything you suggested
---
It's not, and since you won't discuss it, we just have this dumb shouting match.
---
&gt;The number of people caring and posting is irrelevant when it’s all the same garbage solutions that would be worse than the current design
---
I disagree.
---
&gt;Stop. Posting. The. Same. Bullshit
---
You. Don't. Have. To. Read. It. Or. Vote. Or. Comment. Why don't you just go comment on the 30th post about someone asking if rolling dwarf is necessary if he wants to be an Ally priest?
---
I can only hope my wife will fall in love with this game like that.
---
And a massive wasteland of only one color, grey. Nothing but grey as far as you can see. Even the sky was grey there. Fuck Desolace.
---
What I've noticed with myself and games is that once I get to a point in a game where the experience becomes repetitive it becomes a chore to open. For instance, there was this one game I was playing where I got pretty far, but then in order to progress it was essentially "just do these things over and over, then you will progress the story where you get to do those same things over and over again! What fun!"
---
I've noticed this with a lot of games! And yes, WoW is definitely repetitive, but there are so many things that you can do in the game to break repetitive cycles to enjoy different aspects of the game. I think this is why I like WoW so much because it is repetitive, but there are many different ways to break repetition within the game.
---
Thanks
---
People were just as good in Vanilla.  Resist gear is needed much less because of patch 1.12 rather than the fable of private server skill increase.
---
I've been playing online games with my husband since UO days. Thankfully, he didn't make the mistakes many people do when they try to get a significant other to try and play online games with them.
---
First, let her pick Alliance or Horde. Don't choose for her.
---
You're excited to get her to try it out, great! Don't let that excitement ruin it for her and the chance to enjoy online gaming together. 
---
Keep your advice to yourself...at first. Talk about the classes and what they do first, or better yet, point her to a site that will give her this information, or let her jump in and start playing around with classes. 
---
Do not overload her with information, she will just let it go in one ear and out the other, get intimidated, and frustrated then could give up before giving it a chance. 
---
Do encourage her to ask you any questions she may have. 
---
If she picks a class you know a lot about, PLEASE don't tell her how to play it. She needs to learn a bit on her own. Try to remember your first time playing, messing up a lot helps you learn, just like anything else in life. Later on you can give her tips. (Don't trespass her ears.) A lot of times people can get so excited that they get their significant other to play the game, they forget to just be quiet and only give advice when asked for it.
---
Make it a fun time, don't yell or get mad when she goofs up.
---
Can’t have 1 out but you can still benefit from a demon sac
---
Who said anything about 15 layers? Even 2 layers will make the server severely over crowded by the time they turn off layering.
---
There were very few cons, but Locks were a lot less flashy than some of the other classes. It was along time ago but here is what I can remember.
---
- You can be overlooked for other DPS classes in groups while leveling; other classes were more useful in dungeons in terms of versatility. Sap, lock pick, conjure food, etc. This is from what I recall in pre-60 dungeons, though.
---
- Gear: while leveling I remember always having to roll against a priest or mage for some cloth item/staff/wand. It took me forever to get the gear I wanted.
---
- Low mobility
---
- Soul shards
---
- DoTs and rotations aren’t as fun as a mage’s or rogue’s
---
How did you make your gold? I have nothing to do until classic.
---
Yeah i wanted to go horde this time around aswell. Just happend to be so that my guild wanted to do the same.
---
9 days sounds like a decent compromise between efficiency and "smelling the roses."  I'll be hoping for closer to 6 days for me this time.  
---
For reference: my first two characters had like 20 and 15 days played on them when they got to 60 in 2004-2005. That included boatloads of inefficiency as well as goofing around exploring, playing world pvp, or falling in the lava in Ironforge.
---
Warlock: Orc or Undead?
---
Undead have the obvious aethetic match, but orcs have the lore. The sweet sweet lore.
---
What the hell are you talking about? No shit, working out is always better. And no, you're bat shit crazy. The only way you're gaining muscle while losing FAT, is lean bulking. You technically don't lose weight, but you gain muscle while losing fat at the same time. It's extremely hard, and absolutely not something anyone here is going to want to do.
---
And what the fuck are u even talking about? Did you say you can be in a caloric surplus AND a deficit at the same time? I've been lifting for 15 years, my numbers would scare you, and you're some little keyboard warrior. I know my shit, piss off kiddo. 
---
BIG P.S: I DIDNT SAY YOU CANT WORK OUT ON A BAD DIET. I SAID YOU CANT OUTWORK A BAD DIET. Learn to read genius. It's physically impossible for someone to lose weight if they are eating terribly at a surplus. Working out while eating junk will allow them to gain some muscle, but it severely decreases the amount of muscle you can gain based on your insulin levels. In stupid terms for you, the more fat you are, the less muscle you'll gain and retain from working out.
---
I definitely didn't do this most of the time, but now and then I just figured I'd get all cozy in bed before I log off.  There's nothing more comfortable than a Tauren hammock made out of fat scratchy ropes.  Throw a blanket over that and you've got some quality sleep coming.
---
Layering?
---
You're describing layering.
---
But with more steps.
---
I used to do that all the damn time. Not since early bc though.
---
I plan on it, however I’m waiting until I’m 60 before looking for a guild that is ready to raid, as many top guilds will still need bodies.
---
Exactly! School, homework and parents saying you can't raid all night.
---
Now I have a 37 hour job, and a wife that doesn't mind me playing wow while she watches tv! It's gonna be epic!
---
Remember that if you roll Horde, you'll have deal with paladins and their Cleanse.
---
Hunters are the best world PvP class and honestly one of the best PvP class in general. They aren't as amazing in premades, but they do an amazing amount of damage without needing amazing gear and provide plenty of kiting. 
---
For PvP I would choose whichever race you prefer, shadowmeld has it's uses especially if you have a cat with stealth too, stone form also has it's uses.
---
Useful tips. Thank you!
---
Lol since forever?
---
Nope. Just don’t wanna get up.
---
Are there any week 1 rag guilds that are still recruiting at this point? I’d doubt it.
---
Paladins I guess. 
---
Casters can use wands.
---
"Checks if caster and target are players".
---
You should understand your link before you reference it.
---
"I have been averaging about 5-6 hours a week, or 30-60 minutes a day."
---
Yikes, yeah only playing 30-60 minutes per day isn't going to be very quick leveling.
---
The spellbatching system from Cataclysm/Mop was way better. It was dynamic between 1-400ms (average 200ms) and there's no batching applied for interrupts/object triggers and spells casted on yourself. (well technically there is, but it's a different batch that is executed every ~20ms or so)
---
I haven't played the beta but a static 400ms batch sounds horrible. Having a high spell batching window also allow bots to do things like auto Blind a Deep Freeze or auto reflect a magic stun, etc. This is doable as the spells being casted are sent instantly to the combat log, but actually proccessed on the server 400ms later in the batch tick. See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4zBx0cG3Ak&amp;t=0m27s) for example. All of that was done using a bot. These bots were mainstream in arenas in Mist of Pandaria and I do not want to see them again.
---
Especially if both had 2 pc tier 6 and the raid trinkets. Only counter to it was a glaive rogue.
---
I'm mostly the same exact way.  I am a serial downloader of games.  After I download and install them half the time I never even launch the game or if I do launch it I play for 15 minutes and alt + f4 after getting bored.
---
The problem is that most games are literally just a copy paste formula or are such fringe indie games that we can't get into them.  There is just so much junk out there it really waters down the gaming scene.  If a game doesn't capture me in the first half hour I'm never picking it back up.
---
The games I've played for longer than a half hour in the last 2ish years are:
---
Dark Souls, Banjo-Tooie, Pokemon Red, Slay the Spire, Resident Evil 2 Remake (absolutely fantastic game), several VR games, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, a bit of Toontown Rewritten, and that's pretty much it besides vanilla private servers.  
---
I'm looking at the "best games of 2018 list" and just don't see anything that interests me.
---
That’s my plan.  I’d rather join with people who’ve demonstrated they can hit 60 and are still playing than watch a guild implode at 53 when people start burning out because they thought playing WoW 60 hours in 2 days was a good idea.
---
Probably just pick a PvP server with a cool name.
---
And then gearing through 5 mans takes another 2-3 days playtime.
---
I've been playing that on switch! I'm trash but it's fun.
---
it is nelth tear after all, arguably worth for a mage ; )
---
Exactly, my friend convinced his girlfriend to play, right away he was hovering over her shoulder telling her what to do. She eventually said 'do you want me to play, or do you just want to play through me.' He left her alone and they leveled to 20 together. She quit because he was just trying to bum rush through all the quests to level asap, and she just wanted to play. So he was basically that asshole in group screaming 'GOGOGOGOGO!' while the healer is drinking.
---
That logic operates on the assumption everyone can afford BOEs they need which is really dumb.
---
It's an extremely different gaming market than 15 years ago. People who enjoy slower paced mmos play on private/old school servers for a reason. Today's RPG is yesteryear's ARPG, fast paced. That's why BRs have become king. Classic is gonna drag in a lot of us 30+ people, but a lot of us have kids, work, and other stuff to do. You throw a kid that's used to Fortnite into classic and his eyes will be in the back of his head.
---
To be honest, I can't remember the earning rate since it was over 10 years ago, but I had enough money to get mounts and things for the rogue and my other alts. 
---
As for trade skills, I did start with engineering and mining, for pvp, as you need the mining for making engineering things, but after a while, i just focused on making money and switched to enchanting so i could get the best return on items, and kept the mining.
---
With mining, you can go into the caves and elite outdoor areas and mine nodes and get chests etc without having to clear the whole cave on the way in and out. 
---
To be honest, I really enjoyed that part of the game, I really felt like a rogue, sneaking and stealing, and of course pickpocketing the mobs with pockets.
---
This is literally the second thread posted on this exact same topic today. Maybe people don't care to use search, okay. But maybe they could scan the first couple of pages of the sub?
---
And you're out of your damn mind if you think professional athletes aren't on a diet. A diet doesn't mean you can't eat anything unhealthy at all. It just limits how much you can have. It's not gatekeeping to give people a realization - if you eat 3000 calories a day, and your maintenance is 2000, that 200 calorie workout isn't saving you. Sorry. If you're working out for muscle, completely different story.
---
It was just about 8.2 mats before flying- can still make gold - just have to check prices and see what worth farming!
---
This is one of the things with classic.
---
There really isnt any other ways to gain gear upgrades.
---
If you want to pvp sure do pvp, but there is still pvp upgrades from raids.
---
PUGs will happen, will be successful, and will be more fun than raiding with neckbeards.
---
I will absolutely be organizing and leading Friday Night Drunken MC PUGs, and hangover Saturday ZG PUGs.
---
There’s all kinds of stuff to do.  And like  the last post said you don’t need to be a hard-core raider.  I was never a hard-core raider at all and I did plenty of dungeons and a and raids.  just find a casual group you’ll be fine
---
&gt; It's enough to completely miss grenade throws and have them still stun, which you can see in the duel tournaments that happened recently. 
---
Don't grenades stun based on when the cast starts not when the grenade lands?
---
But... how?
---
I didn't specify classic, I said WoW itself. Maybe you should learn how to read before calling anyone stupid.
---
He's playing the game of Life wrong.
---
Mostly like combat, I've played so many open world games with similar combat since its launched and not that it looks clunky but it's just a little dated, maybe it's different when playing it but was never something that made me think I have to play it.
---
So, I will agree that the leeway or hitboxes would be in my classic experience.  I too remember dying a lot trying to run away, being far away but still getting to corpse run.  
---
I don't really agree that I experienced spell batching in the same way I have seen in the beta.  It seems really bad to see a 3.0 second cast take 3.2 seconds to finish casting, or a 2.5 second cast be interrupted between seconds 2.6s and 2.8. I feel that ruins having control of your character and in some extremes makes you feel really bad for essentially a limitation that is no longer relevant.
---
Do you think spell batching at any update interval is acceptable to have in wow classic?
---
Get her to roll pocket healer.
---
Was the mounts not taken out in 1.4.0?
---
Pretty bold of you to assume people playing wow have a gf/bf
---
!remindme 1 year. Let's wait and find out
---
They were cool, but they aren’t going to be in. Not much to discuss
---
I've only been able to enjoy Zelda games and smash brothers. I even made this sweet Orc Shaman in Morrowind but I just couldn't do it and I fucking love Morrowind. But BotW and Ocarina of Time suck up the hours.
---
Hilarious 😆
---
Without greed there’d be no game. Unfortunately.
---
Greed from a company that ALSO cares about the game &gt; greed from a company that doesn’t care about the game. Hopefully blizzard fits the former for classic.
---
I won’t even be max level within the first month.
---
You check out my old guildy's post from vanilla. Your post reads like the good old gospel of the alliance from Azgalor.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/User:Banduril/Gospel_of_the_Alliance_Azgalor?useskin=oasis
---
The batching is way off. Its borderline killing my excitement for classic. 
---
&gt;Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably
---
I ONLY played classic and barely remember interactions like this happening. I definitely don't think "somewhat reliably" is an appropriate standard. Once in a blue moon seems better for everyone involved. Not to mention that interrupting spells seems to be ridiculously broken with this large batching period.
---
The leeway seems a bit too large as well, and seems to be working on mobs too (which seems to NOT be blizzlike from vanilla WoW). Reduce the leeway and make sure that it doesn't work on mobs.
---
Oh, I know what you specified, which is why I called you an idiot.  This entire post chain is about Classic being a niche market and you went and planted a flag on a different hill on the other side of the mountain range to defend.  Not only are you too incompetent with words to know which point to defend and attack, but you seem to be unhinged.  Pathetic.
---
Probably, yeah
---
This test is basically meaningless without you providing your schedule.
---
Average Work schedule start/end time
---
Sleeping schedule?
---
etc
---
I work m-f 7:30am to anywhere from 2pm-8pm - due to nature of my work average 4-5pm though
---
I dont go to sleep until about 1-2am.
---
2 kidsm no girl (fwb on call)
---
So i can essentially get about 3-5 hours a night if i wanted to but most likely ill only put in about 2-3. Ill probably play 3 or so days during the work week, just depends on if i get caught up reading, documentaries, tvshows etc.
---
This time would probably stay the same on weekends with the occasional no life day thrown in here and there.
---
There is no rush for me. Ill get there when i get there and ill make friends with relevant people during my game.
---
World pvp was never a large part of classic though. BC was hands down the best version of wow because all the classes (and most specs) were actually playable and every class was elite at at least one major aspect of the game.
---
I don't believe there was ever dynamic spell batching.  According to [this blue post](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#131814318748), it was always a 400ms tick rate, but they eventually modified the system to just process "as fast as we can".
---
I still have A and D bound to turn. and Q and E to strafe. I don't keyturn.
---
Some were a month ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvoww6/unarmored_mounts_should_not_be_removed/
---
I couldn't care less, and most seem over it.
---
It's 1.12
---
Gw2, runescape, ever quest, black desert online, swtor, star trek online, eve, are all true mmorpg. The thing is, most multiplayer games fulfill the MMO category that wow started out in. Needing internet connection was niche when wow released, now it's mandatory for most games. MMORPGs a la wow haven't really been popular in the modern gaming atmosphere.
---
Oh, that sounds so cool. I'll consider it. Didn't you miss engineering after dropping it?:(
---
My memories are consistent with yours. I never remember it being like this.
---
I don’t even know how that is supposed to work.  Either its pre-existing poopsockers who know each other and the fact their living conditions give them huge amounts of free time, or they’re recruiting a bunch of people who may or may not follow through and they’re going to have recruitment issues at 60 anyway.  
---
Imagine 2 try hard guilds both planning to have a roster of raiders in the first week.  Maybe half of them get there, and suddenly you’ve got a potential full raid and guild leaders butting heads over how they’re going to get that week 1 rag kill.  I can already see people sniping other guilds of their 60s and watching the drama unfold as people still leveling get told they just lost their raid spot to someone who leveled faster, or that they’re not going to make week 1 or even 2 because all the level 60’s bailed to join some other try hard guild.
---
Ovie is the most likeable islander of all time.
---
I never played vanilla. However I pugged my way through raids in WOTLK. Got all my BIS gear aside from the heroic versions or shadowmourne. I killed the lich King in a pug. I’m not a raider. I can’t commit to multiple nights. However I don’t see why I can’t put my way through again. Just guna mostly pvp and dungeon. I’ll befriend guilds and pug raids when I’m available.
---
I've no better reasons why or why not so i'll go with it cheers for the help!
---
I only started in TBC, but I feel like the game was more about journey than destination back then. You weren't meant to skip a bunch of old content to get to max level ASAP so you could start playing the game. Leveling *was* the game, experiencing the World and meeting people while doing so. Online gaming was nowhere near what it is now, so I feel like this was a pretty big deal and a different mindset. Not saying it's better or worse than what we have now, just how I perceive it.
---
I did and didn’t see it. If you don’t want to be helpful then don’t comment.
---
Q and E are super useful keybinds for people who rest on WASD.  I personally shift my whole bar down 1 so it starts on ```, and then `e` is right below your pointer and still very useful.
---
Make sure to let her know you appreciate her giving it a chance and that most of your excitement comes from getting to do something together that both of you can enjoy for years to come. :)
---
My priest from vanilla onwards was a dorf so I guess i'll go back to my roots!
---
I always ask if it's okay to need before I need a blue item. I'll typically link my current piece when I ask so that people can see that I'm not being a ninja. Then I immediately equip it. This is not "the only way" of doing things but by doing it this way people dont think poorly of me. If you dont wanna go through all that, just see what other people roll and follow suit. You dont wanna be labelled a ninja looter for some shithole blue like khoo's point.
---
I mean, you're just gonna use whatever the best ranged weapon you have is. Particularly for leveling. If it's a gun, use a gun. If it's a bow, use the bow. And I mean there's not really that many good guns dropping from high end raids, so if you're pushing endgame content you'll be using a bow just because those are the stronger weapons. But don't worry about trying to use bows early, you'll eventually want (and easily get) max weapon skill in both. Dwarves get the +5 gun skill racial which is helpful for hitting, but ranged attacks dont deal with glancing blows like Melee does so it's a lot less important as long as you have 300 weapon skill and a couple pieces of hit gear.
---
Okay dude, private servers don't matter. Show it to me on live and I'll be impressed.
---
People didn't suck during Vanilla. There isn't really a skill gap...  
---
Yes, people were noobs early on but they learned the game. As usual, some players are better and/or more dedicated than others.
---
Soloing BRD? There was a video of a rogue doing solo Emperor runs, yes.
---
As for resistances... wasn't there unavoidable damage in some fights? Skill doesn't help against that.
---
I initially rolled undead but when the server crunch happened on the Stress Test I rolled Troll with my RL friend. The only Troll name I could remember was "Zen'kiki" so I went with that. I hope it doesn't upset anyone, but after reading about him I really love the character and I think I'm just going to stick with it.
---
Really struggling to decide between Mage/Hunter and Priest. 
---
On one hand, I’ll mostly be PvPing due to real life commitments and not being 13 like I was 15 years ago. Ergo, Mage and Hunter make sense. However, I’d be running the occasional 5 man and hopefully MC/BWL PUG, and I fear that being DPS will add a lot to my group funding time. 
---
Equally, love the Priest fantasy and I’d be happy to heal, but I feel like being Holy will mean months before I can afford a mount, while being Shadow will result in groups wanting me even less... Help a poor man with his choice please?
---
It doesn’t feel great to me. I think both game mechanisms are overturned in their current state. They should pull the opposite of a Jay Wilson and cut them in half.
---
Yeah I made a spreadsheet just for engineering and it took me about 10 hours with all the research.
---
I’m not linking it since it contains all of my secret strategies to rule the World of Warcraft.
---
Blast Wave is a mind game as well! With Barrier, you've gone and given away exactly what your spec is in its entirety by running around looking like a snowflake, so enemies will know exactly what tools your spec provides, but it's always a huge surprise when a mage who already blew several CCs busts out a blast wave too. I never missed ice barrier as a frost or fire mage.
---
ooo cheeky

Learn a flask recipe and sell flasks for tons gold -&gt; Sell a flask recipe for tons gold. I don´t see any difference here.

I usually have different bars on shift+1, shift+2, shift+3 etc and that way I get alot of space for binds.
---
Which is funny since Kalimdor is the home of the oldest races and heart of the OG Troll empire, in a way.
---
Lmfao
---
I'd be okay with Blizz adding them if they also guarantee they won't ever be removed from Classic / Classic+.  If they are ever to be removed though, it makes more sense to never add them since they would be a very un-classic item with big economy/play style impact.
---
Soo nice
---
Seems like you're right. It was dynamic as in 400ms + client/server latency but not 1-400ms it seems like.
---
However, the batch ticker was ~400ms, but if you cast a spell when there's e.g 50ms left on the ticker your spell will be processed immediately after 50ms and not 400ms. People should check if this is also the case with the low priorty spell loop on the Classic beta. If the batching on Classic always delay it 400ms no matter what it obviously will feel off.
---
In one of my picture's there's a dwarf flying though the air because of his wing buffet. I lol'd after thinking "Keep yer feet on the ground!".
---
Private servers had almost every number wrong for everything.
---
I've levelled from 1-40 in the beta, and I haven't really noticed either that much since I haven't PvP'd much at all. I doubt that either one will be that big a deal in PvE.
---
From what I've heard about its impact on PvP, though, it really should be changed. Spell batching should be decreased by at least half, if not a quarter or less of what it is right now. Leeway shouldn't even exist. Melee is already king in Vanilla, they don't need to become all-powerful conquerers of the universe or whatever.
---
Good point.  Do we have reports of anyone actually pulling it off?  It’s ridiculously simple to set up a pserver these days.  Has anyone actually started a server, said “we’ve got one week to down Rag.  Go!” and then pulled it off?  
---
I don’t doubt someone will manage it.  I just doubt most of them will.
---
Then again, I’m just being a negative norgannon.
---
Not pissed because barely anybody kept those mounts and you guys didn’t Give a shit about them then so no reason to give a shot now. You only think they are awesome and want them because you are blinded by the bias created by all the videos out there talking about rare mounts. Hype based on rarity only. You guys want the “prestige” of hanging on to them when the time comes to trade them in when you never cared in Vanilla.
---
Not sure what to play for classic wow. I was young when I first played the game(Wotlk), so I never played vanilla wow. I am only going to have about a hour or two a night to play, and about 8-10 hours total on the weekend. The class I want to play the most is rogue. But I hear that its hard to get into raids/dungeons because there are so many of them. I am going to play on a pvp server, and also plan on doing more pvp then raiding because of the limited time I have to put into the game.  Whats it like to level a rogue, and get gear once you hit 60?
---
The thing that has me wanting to play the rogue the most in getting to go invisible and being able to gank people(dick move I know). I can just imagine sitting in my chair sipping coffee on a Saturday morning, waiting in a bush for someone to run by and gank them. I also prefer melee instead of range. This would also be my first time maining a dps only class. I was a dk tank in mop and loved every second of it. Does the rogue sound like a good fit for me?
---
My guild hosted Aq40 pugs up till twins... and a yearly naxx pug which took out like 6 bosses. :D im a casual now, but ill pug bwl and mc.
---
https://discord.gg/w5975U
---
I was given this when i asked  about guilds. Seems very active and you will most likely find what you're looking for
---
What? Did you play on a normal pop server or something? A lot of servers had 4-5 hours queues for months after release. New servers usually had that for months as well.
---
Yeah, this makes me think twice about my race class combo. I really don't want to waste months runecloth farming, especially as the mounts are 1000g each, rather than the universal  skill being the costly part, so 'just getting 2' is 10x as costly for the second mount,  with the rep grind being 2x as long.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Not true and Just disrespectful in regards to the Work those pserver devs have eine for the Community.
---
Im thinking about starting as a warrior, since I love being in a group for the most part of pre 60 and doing dungeons. Problem is, i don‘t know most dungeons at all and I feel it’s way easier to fuck up as the tank than as dps/heal. Is this a legit concern? I heard most dungeons are quite straight without abilities/special moments you have to look out for. 
---
I heard engineer is kinda mandatory for tanks, is this correct? This newbie is grateful for any hint!
---
On the bright side there won’t be many people who buy a 2nd account to be able to whisper the opposite faction on Classic
---
me either, on my server it was always roll what you want on BoE's cause it can be sorted out later, everyone pass on BoP unless you can equip it right then and there and you're gonna use it. Everyone else passes and then if no one needed it you /roll for it and whoever wins loots the body. 
---
This opens up more holes for ninja looting though so I can see the logic behind rolling need on BoE's and stuff. I guess I was just lucky enough not to ever get fucked over by a ninja looter too bad. Def had some arguments but I was never the one in the middle of the problem.
---
imagine being uncomfortable for 15 years when there are desks and chairs for gaming instead of recliners...
---
There’s an add on called storyline, I’m hoping it comes to classic, just makes the quest givers and he conversation a bit more animation, I enjoy it a lot compared to the standard.
---
Of course- but it isn't 400ms AFTER your cast- it's every 400ms
---
fuck streamers
---
It really wasn't an unpopular opinion at all. The amount of people doing AQ and then Naxx basically fell off a cliff in the last year of vanilla's life. It was very obvious 40 man raids with increasing difficulty and as the only way to progress your character was not sustainable at all.
---
No problemo friend. Have fun!
---
Below is the guild I’m in fantastic mature people, they also have their own private server for mc raid testing etc say refuted sent ya!
---
LF Classic guild? |NewGen|EU|Hardcore|PvP| Recruiting for Classic launch the 27th of August! Raid times Mon/Wed/Sun 19-23 CEST. 2 weeks vacation at launch req. Aiming for top 50 rag. Apply over at http://www.newgenguild.com/
---
I mean, it is true. The beta has shown us that. It’s not disrespectful at all, the people who did the work certainly tried their best but the numbers just aren’t accurate.
---
Hope it works out
---
Unfortunately as a mage I can't go elf so I have no choice. But forget about Runecloth farming, that shit won't even be in right away. It wasn't in vanilla until later. 
---
For Darnassus you can still do Morrowgrain turn ins, but if you want to be exalted with other factions you're screwed.
---
Honestly, if someone gets upset over you naming your character 'Zenkiki', are they really worth listening to on the matter? It's fairly inoffensive, and they'll probably end up using some edgy, ironic, stupid shit (I know I've made my fair shares of Stregenqt, Stregenqtpie, etc) over the years after Stregen was taken by my main...
---
tldr, name your character whatever you want.
---
So you work all day then play all evening/night and sleep 6 hours each day?
---
The 0.85 hours left you somehow fit in bathroom breaks? 
---
All of your food is prepared for you and you eat and drink while playing? 
---
Genius!
---
How could you even CONSIDER that?! There's GOT to be another way!
---
Completely misplaced question and hijack, dude.

---
Tauren for pve orc for pvp.
---
Yes its been done on private servers before.
---
I find using ctrl / alt / shift makes moving while casting a lot harder due to hand position.  Having a mouse with even a couple buttons as "modifiers" is a lot easier for me, so mouse3+`, mouse3+1, etc.  
---
This time around I plan on using a lot more macros for things since I'll be playing a priest instead of a warlock.  Downranking and targetting macros at the very least
---
Same with human paladin. Any mount other than horse haha.
---
You won’t be disappointed in the warlock.  They are just fun.
---
bad timing. Tell the group the situation and they might let you have it and trust you. Or they might play strict and say that doesn't count.
---
Yea 200ms average seems wrong for Cataclysm and beyond, but some sort of dynamic period between 1-10ms based on server load seems reasonable.
---
If you need a boe then why didn´t you buy it from the AH?
---
Going solo as a warrior isn't as bad as people say, but having a healer sure does make it a blast. 
---
I find being aloof to be the best way to get pug pocket healers. Telling a retribution paladin to do whatever he wants gets them healing me every time, but telling them to throw me a heal gets a bitter, unreliable player and it isn't worth the effort. 
---
Usually healers just latch on to whoever makes a decent effort at controlling the battle, whether it be killing real good or peeling rogues off your lifeline.
---
We both needed on crimson felt hat.
---
Play what you want. I never liked the tauren aesthetic, not to mention I thought their introduction and even existence in Warcraft 3 was super weird.
---
my hype keeps building!! haha altho i definitely am a little late to the party tho real gamers have known for a while
---

---
Alright interesting, I was thinking of [that post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsmu8x/kevin_jordan_confirms_that_dynamic_respawns/?sort=top)
---
It depends on how spillover reputation works.  I recall being able to get a Kodo back in Vanilla on an orc without having to do a bunch (if any) cloth turn ins, but as I recall it also involved doing every damn quest in the game to maximize spillover rep.  
---
It also entirely possible by the time I did that they had released the cloth patch and I just dumped a bunch of runecloth and forgot about it because it was so easy.
---
If you're gonna go into dungeons with items in your bag not equiped solely for the purpose of tricking the group in the small chance that item drops....I say you earned it at that point. Go for it.
---
Dwarfs are like the Russians. Always drunk, live in cold snowy regions, dancing Kazachok and kinda suck at the game.
---
I'd put week 1 and week 2 guilds into separate categories.
---
Week 1 is pushing the limit and will require a lot of preparation, as in:
---
1) Account sharing (having multiple people play a single character during the 1st week).
---
2) Recent practice leveling and clearing MC (i.e. pserver players).  
---
Not that MC is hard, but clearing MC in 2005 or watching someone's youtube guide is not a replacement for recent practice where you can do it in your sleep...or in green gear, which you will have for week 1.
---
3)  A coordinated rep farming plan.  This means you need to be 58-ish near/at the front of the pack so you don't have competition from other guilds trying to farm rep, then also and sacrifice some leveling speed by grinding elementals, and actually get your roughly 2 levels + honored rep there then ALSO do the steps inside MC which is going to slow down your clear (yes even with warlock + summoners parked in azshara.  And do all of that within the first week.
---
Number 3 is the hardest part out of those since it's kind of unknown how much time it will take if the mobs are contested.
---
-----------------
---
Week 2 clear is pretty basic.
---
1)  Have 60+ people who are taking time off from work to level.
---
2)  Have at least 30 of those people make it to 60 by around day 7 then get some decent gear, farm rep.   Have some stragglers get 60 by day 10 and get attuned.
---
3)  Allocate time, let's say days 12-14 for for the people who haven't played on pserver recently to re-learn some of the quirks in MC.  (ex Garr) and to get through the 'pain' of clearing MC in a lower than normal gear level.
---
Week 2 should be pretty painless if you have an established group of reliable players.
---
Any guild that is publicly recruiting promising week 2 I'd be skeptical of.
---
Not that there aren't some good ones out there, but if you're recruiting a bunch of random players you're relying on just that...random people who may or may not even be good/make it to 60/stay in your guild/etc to clear MC by week 2.
---
I'd imagine most groups like that will have to pug with other guilds to get it done week 2.
---
Never heard of it, I'll take a look. Thanks for the tip!
---
&gt; Unfortunately I can't check Thottbot because I can't find this quest in the wayback machine.  
---
Doesn't matter anyway because the database websites back then never thought to track reputation on their pages. The source you seek is the comments.  
---
There are hints out there of the true numbers, but it's really up to you to decide who has the right data.
---
Someone ran a test comparing the time they hit their action button to when the combat log event came in from the server, and they were seeing variable delays from ~80 to ~350ms, so I don't think it's just delaying 400ms.
---
Neat.  Here’s hoping they can pull it off on live.
---
Off tank is probably doable, main tank slot usually requires a lot more experience / knowledge depending on the guild. Tank spots in general seem in very high demand.
---
Even as a DPS warrior, you will end up tanking 5-10 mans to gear up though and while leveling, so you will get to practice!
---
the more realistic numbers are around 120 than 40 lol.
---
you need account sharing, ppl who stop at lvl20 just to fish for materials, locks parked at important places etcetc. It's a lot more complicated than just "40 peeps rush 60 ggoogogo".
---
Also ppl allways credit wrong things like the rep farm. Rep farmr is srsly no big deal a couple of mages will do it in 3 hours.Biggest obstacle is magg as the raid will only have a SINGLE tranq shot in week1 and killing him with only 1 tranq in green gear involves a bit of luck/good rng.
---
Horde is better because horde is best.
---
If she asks for help or has questions about the game, answer with all the information she needs.  
---
Otherwise you just leave her alone and let her do as she pleases. If she doesn't like it, then oh well - it's just not her for her.
---
I think it is a World Drop off 61+ elites (Raid trash?)              
---
            
---
80x Thorium Bars              
---
10x Blue Sapphires              
---
12x Arcanite Bars              
---
4x Azerothian Diamonds            
---
                
---
Even if some super duper Classic meth eating freak of nature levels his character to 60, gears him well enough to start clearing trash from MC ASAP in his no lifer guild of 40 like minded folks and has good RNG luck getting the pattern to drop AND through lack of sleep from what i'm assuming is a mixture of Adderall, Monster Zero and Testicle shock therapy also has his Black Smithing maxed out to learn it then he still needs a lot of mats locked behind CDs which good luck knowing that many Alchemists or having that much gold on hand to buy the mats.          
---
             
---
Honestly if I see anyone wearing the Lionheart Helm in phase 1, I'm dragging them to a mental institute where the walls are padded.
---
Wait do you not use your mouse? Or do you have to lift your hand all the way off the arrows go use your spells?
---
Warriors are generally expected to lead the group in pulling and whatnot. That being said it's hard as hell to find tanks usually, just make sure you are up front with your lack of experience and generally someone will step up and lead it with explanations in exchange for not having to look for a tank for another 30minutes. 
---
Engi is very strong because it helps warriors with their weakest thing in vanilla tanking, aoe threat. A grenade or sapper or engi shield makes large pulls waaaaay easier.
---
This is a joke right?
---
That's true, you are correct, the only downside to that is insulin plays a role. It gets complicated, but once you get to around 25% body fat, your insulin levels go up and your protein synthesis goes down. 
---
This means say the average lifter can gain 2 LBs of pure muscle a month. That person that has higher insulin levels may only be able to gain 1 pound. (These aren't real numbers, just can example). More of the weight gained after a certain point will just be fat. But yeah fat *is* also strength, which is why the world's strongest men are usually a bit hefty
---
Cool. I think the progression makes it worthwhile. His description of proper form is clear and accurate. 
---
The book is great for the practical side of calisthenics but his science is not up to the minute and the early chapters on theory are not worth reading imo. This doesn’t diminish the books value which rest squarely on the practical stuff. 
---
I find a lot of books on exercise are total crap, this isn’t one.
---
I understand that. I cant blame anyone for wanting an edge. See you out there :)
---
lmao wtf
---
Also keep in mind that Feral is a *lot* more viable as a tank at endgame than many would have you believe. Skarm does a lot of great videos on Warrior and Druid tanking and he strongly believes that Feral can perform very well for many bosses. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo
---
I hope we can establish this somehow. The community needs to realize that Warriors aren't the only tank in Vanilla, and that Feral can do great if not better on resist fights especially.
---
I will never watch an Alexensual video.
---
We won't even know, blizzard doesn't release their numbers. There will still be millions of people subbed regardless of classics player count though.
---
Ganking scrub alliance in STV.

They're coarse and rough and irritating and they get everywhere.

We won't even know, blizzard doesn't release their numbers. There will still be millions of people subbed regardless of classic's player count, though.
---
Hello. I started out as a rogue on a vanilla server recently and I have had to read a lot of info the past couple weeks as I was in the same position as you. For end game 60, you can pvp and pve In a combat dagger build, daggers are amazing I’m pvp and although swords are better for pve, you will still do just fine in 5 mans and raids unless your group is absolute min max. As far as leveling goes and the wpvp that comes along with it, I have rolled combat swords and opted to use some talent points in a few different spots to make pvp a little more enjoyable. I have improved backstab and switch to a dagger in my MH to open again most clothies and then switch to my sword right after BS. most people would not get improved backstab for their combat sword build but I wanted to get the most out of WPVP while leveling so I tweaked my build a bit. At 60 definitely go daggers or hemo spec but until then I find combat swords with some tweaks to work just fine for leveling and pvp
---
The combat log events should be processed "as fast as we can" (hence the bot exploits mentioned earlier being possible) so you can't check that alone. Not sure how to test it properly tbh.
---
IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US!
---
&gt; I wouldn't worry about pulling out the tricks. 
---
Ok, phew.  I was worried I'd need to do something crazy to farm gold.
---
&gt;Myself I boxed 3 accounts and did DM boss runs for shards and made a killing for months, and never once saw Furor's sadly. But I made enough to buy it lol.
---
Oh, you pulled out the tricks, huh?
---
destroyed
---
Attempting to get your BIS in crafting items is just plain fiscally irresponsible. Given we need our epic mounts for when WSG comes out, that should be everyone's gold focus, but hey, I'll go alchemy and everyone can give me 500g for my fucking arcanite bar CD. Lol
---
Fake, no way a paladin killed that many boars before they started respawning.
---
&gt; I believe it can be fixed
---
They can't get sharding right after 10 years, you really think it is likely they can get this right after a few stress tests?
---
I have four friends who are returning to WoW after dropping off in TBC. I’ve played since Vanilla but missed a few xpacs along the way.
---
Regardless— I’ve put by far the most hours into the game of my old crew and have the deepest understanding of the lore, mechanics, efficiencies, etc. but none of us will be going the min/max route.
---
That being said, I’m looking to play a class that will enhance my friend’s experience. We’re going alliance and they plan to roll a hunter, mage, warlock, and rogue or druid respectively.
---
What class would be the best to support them? I expect we won’t ever all be online at the same team, so I’m not looking for an optimal five-man, just wondering what would make the experience best for others.
---
I’m leaning paladin or druid, but thought priest might be cool as a sort of pocket healer.
---
Let me know your suggestions! Thanks.
---
Could be left handed maybe?
---
Oh yeah.  It was clunky when it came out and I forced myself to play through the first intro zone before quitting and never picking it back up.  The movement system is god awful.
---
Isn't this where the 12k shadow bolt crits meme came from?
---
The game is brutally hard.  I got to the third major boss, but died.  If I had one card with block that turn I would have beat him.
---
&gt;I looked and it's still a few weeks not until phase 2. Maybe you have the wrong info here.
---
They initially said a few weeks and then updated it to being removed before phase 2.
---
&gt;It's not completely static but it's predictable.
---
It's not static or predictable at all!  What?
---
&gt;Accepting invites is voluntary =&gt; layer hooping is voluntary since they are performed while doing a voluntary action.
---
Sigh.  I'm getting a bit frustrated here.  People =/= you. **You can do nothing and still have people in your layer constantly changing as *other* people join your layer and leave it.**
---
&gt;That's just normal server merging with extra steps and same downsides
---
Basically, except it's a proactive approach in which no one loses their character or guild name, and merges are done sooner rather than later.
---
&gt;It's not really that biased. It's actually one community able to communicate at any point in time vs 5 separate communities that can't communicate and might never meet if clusters are not merged like you suggest.
---
It's completely biased.  The implication that servers in server clusters will have an average peak population of 2k is insane, especially when I have suggested to aim for peaks of 6-8k max for a high pop server.
---
&gt;To each his own I guess. I still see it as one single community. Just because I can't always see them it doesn't mean they aren't there and when layering is gone I will be able to see them every time
---
And if a few weeks from now, your server has 25k people, what's the plan then?  Will you just have a close-nit 25 thousand person group of familiar faces?
---
&gt;. And if layering works as I think it does you should be able to see the same people consistently even with layering
---
Layering is not static.
---
Let me simplify this with a 20k population. A 12k server and 8k server with layers vs assorted cluster servers, an 7k, 6k, 4k 3k.  We'll use example of 40% drop and 80% drop.
---
You are on the 12k server.  The population drops 40%.  Well shit.  You're still stuck with 7.2k people and layering. What do?  Not so bad if you're on the 8k server, in which you get dropped to 4.8k.  Do they still take Layering out?
---
Let's say the population drops 80%.  If you're on the 12k server, you end up with 2.4k people on your server and no layers. Not bad!  Your 8k account is not so fortunate.  It drops to 1.6k pop.  Not great.
---
Now for server clusters.  40% drop. Immediately merge the 3k server with the 4k.  You now have 3 thriving servers, 2 of which didn't need to merge at all, and the two that did were done as soon as possible, with no name changes, mitigating the damage.
---
80% drop. Merge the 7k and 3k, merge the 6k and 4k.  You end up with two 2k servers.
---
You are probably seeing the benefit of server clusters: FLEXIBILITY!  Whether the population is declining rapidly or not much at all, you can have static servers with healthy populations.  Ironically, not true with Layering.
---
Dude this legit hit me hard.
---
It would be very handy if there was a source out there with the right numbers tho. Then I could figure out which quests and how many rep I would need and at which lvl it would be possible to get exalted. I hope the data on Classic WoWhead is correct.
---
Inn didn’t matter as long as I had a bed. Oh to be 12 and playing in 2004 again lol
---
I just herb farmed for most of my gold.  There was no fucking way I was going to pay 3-5k for Furor's, so I decided I would farm it by 3 boxing for the book in DM.  It never dropped, but I earned 5k doing that shitty grind so bought it in the end.  Would rather have had 3k and the book drop lol.
---
Sure. They’re pretty huge though in pvp. Similarly, the market for faps will be pretty active too as they are cheap enough to buy on the ah to not bother wasting a profession slot.
---
I'll pick some German PVE server that sounds cool or is based on a lore char I like
---
They had to guess, remember, or watch videos to try to see what numbers worked where. Have you ever run a private server on your comp? It's a shell of a game without the back end set up.
---
Eh, just pick up pages as you do the hunts, then go to Booty Bay AH and spend 1g to pick up the missing pieces, easy as hell if you dont mind losing a bag to pages while youre questing
---
It was during retail too. I managed to one-shot some people with ToeP, CoS and a good shadow bolt crit thanks to it. I think I could hit up to 4.2k damage by then. I just checked my PVP vid and I didn't have crazy crits there, but it may be worth checking early Drakedog vids. It must have been fixed between 1.6 and 1.8.
---
"End Anger Things"
---
Female Dwarf ponytails have sick animations! Do it for the tails!
---
I listen to it on Spotify so I don't ever have that problem haha. I love the technical talk though. People are so knowledgeable and it's great to absorb the knowledge!
---
Nope.
---
me too. i think the space between the D and the A is throwing us off. it looks disconnected.
---
BoE's are easily sold to make gold. Everyone needs gold.
---
This truth means needing on BoEs will be standard.
---
How can you not credit them for coming back? Blizzard themselves have stated that the popularity of Nostalrius and other pservers was a hugs part of them moving forward with classic. 
---
I wont debate you on the numbers, but pservers are a huge part of why we are getting classic.
---
If the druid is a healer, your group is missing a tank.  
---
If the druid is feral and reasonably willing to tank for 5mans, you need a healer paladin or priest would both work great. 
---
If the druid goes rogue, or is exclusive cat you might have a problem.  Maybe go healer and hope your group can recruit a tank.  Honestly if you all played vanilla you can probably do most dungeons while leveling without a tank as a fun, hard-mode type experience anyways.
---
Ya I figured that with a Warrior/healer settup it must just feel like you have a pet that you can heal yourself with
---
I may be misremembering exactly what they were doing, I can't find the original post as it was buried in some loosely related thread.
---
_r/sbubby would like to know your location_
---
Go find Mankrik's wife.
---
He misses her.
---
Orc for both due to axe spec. Unless you're tanking. 
---
Undead for PvP is another option. Cannibalize is highly underrated and has saved me countless times. Stun resist is nice and more reliable than 25% would have me believe, but Cannibalize has usefulness basically everywhere, and it's fun to eat your opponents even if you're at full health. You can create a stam set to fill up your entire health bar too.
---
The beta uses a physical 1.12 server to check numbers, I would have to guess its right.
---
If youever want to do dungeons with them it depends on the rogue/druid. If the druid is bear, go pally or priest for heals. If the druid is a healer go pally or warrior so you have a tank. If the druid goes rogue or feral, probably go pally for general support and heals. If the druid is a boomkin god help you all
---
If you don't know the dungeons I'm guessing you're a newer player, meaning you didn't play WoW in the Vanilla-WOTLK era. I'm just going to warn you on this, even as a tank, it's a lot harder to power-level in dungeons than it is now. Like A LOT harder. It's doable, and I think it's actually efficient, but just don't get the idea you won't have to quest like the rest of us meme-specs.   
---
As to your actual question: yes it's a lot easier to fuck up as the tank, but even then it's not actually a hard job to do (as long as we're talking 5 mans). The game starts small and works it's way up. You'll be fine. 
---
I don't know enough about engineering+tanking to answer that at all.
---
I like it a lot, and appreciate its power spike in tbc but I couldn't main it in that expansion. The tree looks ridiculous and all your fantastic tier sets are hidden by it :(
---
minimum, I think it could reach 50 million if they market it well
---
^^^^^^/s
---
I was in Desolace farming/skinning mobs while waiting for my wife to join me.  Killed a mob and a blue ring dropped and the loot roll box popped up and I was thinking *'WTF?!?'* so I rolled need.
---
Lost.
---
My wife had just entered group range when the ring dropped so she got to roll on it.  I asked her to give me the ring and she laughed at me.
---
It has been 15 years and I am still stewing over it.  I bought it up the other day and she laughed at me.
---
Mailbox dancing, same as everyone else.
---
Yes, write some more paragraphs about ppl being unhinged plz.
---
It's pre-bis if you're not a filthy poor and plan to just buy gold with real money for it.
---
Keep in mind private server TPS is too high for feral. Still good tanks but on wow classic wont be doing the insane threat skarm pulls. Also anyone who has been here a while has already been drowned in druid tank information so most know they’re viable
---
Count me in as well. I'm the only one I know who plays with the numpad + arrows.
---
thats good, i dont want filthy humans/gnomes and dwarfs using our mounts and overpopulating our starting zones
---
This isn’t Vanilla this isn’t p servers. When bosses go down in classic they will be for the first time ever because Classic wow isn’t vanilla and it’s not p server.
---
Interesting that you think the concept of a paragraph is something the mock.
---
The guild i'm going with is aiming for week 2 maybe 3 if things go slow. I already did rag day10 on a pserver and I quite enjoyed the grind for it so I'll try again, but ultimately I looked for a good guild whether or not they do 2 week rag isn't that big a deal.
---
I think I am going to have to! Playing a rogue in vanilla/classic sounds like some much fun, especially for pvp. How is pve content playing a rogue?
---
Thanks for the kind words, I’m glad you’re enjoying the the show! The plan is definitely to keep going after launch, but for how much longer I couldn’t say. I don’t plan on doing Countdown for several more years, I will likely try another gaming podcast project after :)
---
Lol there is absolutely no way it's worth it to level a warlock just to grind mobs to get linen so you can make a wand on your priest.   
---
Priest is perfectly playable for 1 day with no wand. You will survive, just use deep breaths and cast smite. Second day you log on, go and buy one off ah for 30silver.
---
&gt; Pretty sure my guild heard the whole exchange over ventrilo
---
That is why i always use push to talk, so guildies don't hear my wife nagging me.
---
&gt;YOU are the one who needs to provide a source for your claim, you don't get to make shit up then go tell other people to do your work. Ion said they "promise" to remove it in "a few weeks", and that it can't last until phase 2 because of world bosses. How you got "yep gonna last the entire phase 1 no doubt" from that is beyond me.
---
Ok smart guy.  How big are layered servers going to be?  How big is the player drop going to be?  Oh, what's that?  You and Blizzard have no clue?  Then how do you know how long Layering will last?  Also, when is Phase 2 *exactly*?  Is that a guarantee?
---
&gt;Peak population is 2-3k concurrent players, your numbers are completely unrealistic.
---
???? What?  The whole point is to plan for drop offs.  Obviously without Layering you'll have some pretty big servers, which I'm trying to account for in my example.  I'm certainly not saying 9k is ideal.
---
&gt;You're super wrong here because the community of 10k players DOES EXIST, because they can chat with each other. By your own logic, people on the other continent are not in your "community" because you simply won't see them. But if they're in Darn and your're in IF, you can still talk to each other. Community is so so so much more than just seeing the same people all of the time.
---
To be clear: in a 10k layered community...
---
1. Increase in the number of people in chat.
---
2.  Significant inrease in the variety of people you run into out in the world.
---
3.  Significant decrease in the consistency in which you run into people multiple times out in the world.
---
#1+2 aren't bad by themselves, it's #3 that is awful.  Have you queued for LFG or LFR in retail?  Do you ever give a shit about the revolving door of people you're matched with? How about when you level as you're sharded in and out?  When we know we are unlikely to see someone again, we don't give a shit.
---
I'm not saying it will be impossible to make friends, but what I am saying is relying on general chat to do that is not vanilla.
---
Just trying to show you how silly you sound. You seem very unintelligent.
---
Yea at that price ... everyone "needs" it.

---
no it hasn't? From my knowledge the fastest is day 10 by progress
---
Only like 5% of the playerbase were raiders back in vanilla. There is so much else you can do besides raiding. Not to mention there is plenty of content that is PUGable and you can do it on your time.
---
Not to mention leveling itself is a huge part of the game that most overlook. Leveling is going to take you forever, learn to enjoy the journey
---
You dont need to be holy until 60, and even then with some healing gear you dont even need to get off shadow unless you raid.
---
I stay shadow all the way to 60 and have no problem healing.  Maybe later on strat/scholo/ubrs give you a bit of a hard time but you can adjust then, and always find a guild group with better players.
---
When I played vanilla, I afforded my 40 mount at 40.  I dont remember when I got my epic tbh, but I know I did have it.
---
200ms was the average delay from the spell being detected in the combat log to actually taking effect on the player, atleast from my experience. If you used Interruptbar (interrupt tracker) in earlier expansions it was common to see the interrupt icon on the addon before your player actually got interrupted. (Funny thing, you could abuse this to always get a fakecast off if you had low ping)
---
I thought this was the batch tick itself but seems like it was just a side effect.
---
This is incredible, thank you so much for sharing it! Aug 27th can’t come fast enough. Lok’tar!
---
Private servers of course. They have gotten so many things wrong that it's amazing that they have the audacity to call it "blizzlike".
---
Nope
---
To some extend. Your MT will need FR on rag, your tank and melees will need some NR on huhuran, warlocks will need SR to tank twins, and everyone will need some FrR for Sapphiron no matter what.
---
So, a cohesive multi-sentence thought is silly and unintelligent to you.  We've circled back to that unhinged and dumb as fuck check list.
---
It's a picture of Mankrik's wife
---
They're boiling hot in the middle don't you worry.
---
Yeah, never doubt the power of weaponized autism
---
We will know the streamers servers before launch
---
I don't know what pot you're smoking lol.
---
If you care about aesthetics, just pick what you want.  If you care about racials, orc all the way, because rogues are your toughest matchup and 30% chance to shrug off stuns is nothing to laugh at.  Also in serious pvp everyone is going to be engineering, so they'll all be trying to stun with iron grenades.  There's just a lot more stuns in the game than there are fears.
---
Think it's fire / arcane after aq launches if crit is high enough.
---
It is true, spoken by the Devs. Specifically Nano, the lead dev of Nostalrius. He said most of the data was estimated/guessed. They didn't actually know the correct values, sorry to burst your bubble :(
---
I had someone try to mind control drown me once.  Joke was on them, I was wearing an underwater breathing helm with helmets turned off.
---
This was all I needed to see, thanks so much
---
Ok so no one wants layering and it's used to prevent queues. So what happens in phase 2 on full realms?
---
So basically, "Im right you're wrong, don't ask me why".  Very convincing.
---
More steps?  You mean like the constant bug fixes, exploit fixes, promises to remove layering, etc?
---
Also, yes it's similar to layering because it's designed to solve similar problems.  And the steps are there to try TO MAKE THE GAME AS GOOD AS IT CAN BE GODDAMNIT I'M TRYING TO HELP HERE!!!!
---
Yep definitely unhinged. Anymore emotional projection from you today, or are you good now?
---
It's damn disrespectful to the accomplishments of guilds like Nihilum to claim world firsts 14 years after the actual world firsts.
---
Not really bursting my bubble, i guess i Just have a different understanding of 'almost Every number for everything' :3
---
You do understand though, that I'd also be passing on a pile of gold if something drops for them, right?
---
And you always have asinine comments with nothing to back them up.  Layering is clearly awful.
---

Pretty much what everyone else said. Don't try to  play for her and, realize. She's not on your level and, isn't ready to be. Let her learn the game and enjoy it in her own way at her own pace. The beginnings of being a wow player is the best part.
---
Yea it definitely wasn't the most graceful introduction.
---
Contrast that with Night Elfs introduction. That was pretty cool. Chopping down lumber in Ashenvale and all of a sudden the woods are talking to you and grunts are freaking out and Gromm is like "shut up and chop pussy".
---
Tauren was more like "Hey greenskin Thrall. We're the Tauren. You and I are friends now. Cool. Let's go kill some Centaurs and stop being a nomadic race and build a massive city."
---
With that said, I still really love the tauren.
---
It's clearly not the software version that prevents you from running naxx, the release plan does not add content that wasn't in 1.12.0. It's not the same as saying you want a horse added to the game, which is an item that couldn't be obtained in 1.12.0
---
People will know where they're at 5 minutes after they create their characters on the seventh.
---
I thought character creation was the 12th/13th?
---
But you do have to put in a lot of time if you want to do anything.
---
That sounds exactly like my first guild back in classic. The guild leader was the wife who mained a priest and was overall really great at the game, had multiple lvl 60s. The husband had one level 60 warrior that couldn't/wouldn't tank and wasn't that great in the dps role either. We might not have ever progressed very far raid wise, probably my most favorite guild I have ever been a part of.

You don't have to spend money to work out.  I would recommend a cheap pair of dumbbells, though.  You can find them at thrift stores or garage sales all the time for a couple bucks.    Body weight exercises don't require anything.
---
She knows about classic. Tonight is the night where she decides if she even wants to play classic. She normally doesn’t play video games at all.
---
Even the casting animations look cooler
---
Just played through both myself and felt the same way! I love the lore of the earlier WoW universe so WC3 was a great way to get even more hyped
---
I just did class race on a random number and got dwarf priest.
---
I dont know, like we all are nerdy, play video games and post opinionated posts on the interner are we not all losers.

I get he has a pretty toxic stance towards classic but i feel its an interesting perspective to see what the otherside thinks.

Can't wait now! Thanks for the info!
---
Right? I work between 40-50 a week, live with my girlfriend, and get at least 6 hours of sleep per night and I can still put a few hours into WoW if I really want to. I might cut a bit off my sleep but that's if I want to put in a good 4-5 hours on a weeknight. Then I usually have most Sundays minus taking the dogs on a long walk and doing a date type thing with the lady. But that's still at least half the day for me.
---
so it wont be the same boss then?

Elwynn forest, Westfall, and Redridge. Done them too many times, and the quests are mostly shit.

Apparently that’s not the norm, no. At least not amongst those I’ve encountered. xD 
---
I’ve only seen a few other players do it, the most have asked me why I do it. x)
---
It could, but bloodthirst doesnt scale with weapon damage which sucks
---
Bgs and WPvP. I’ve spent many years on WoW, played since vanilla, and I’ve finally come to realize that I no longer like the PVE aspect. It’s gotten so stale and boring and I’d rather fight other players now. It’s funny cause back then I hated pvp but now it’s the opposite.
---
Priests are in a unique situation, where the RACE of the priest you play will effect which RACE SPECIFIC priest abilities you get.  
---
This lists the priest racial abilities for all races.  
---
All of the abilities are relatively flavorful, and so at least you have that going for you. There are, however a few racials which are pretty significant, and so it's probably best that you check out that list and figure out if there are any racial abilities which "Are so good that you would feel bad not to play that race."  
---
\--------------  
---
DISCLAIMER: I think these values are correct, but I don't know. For all I know, the effect duration or cooldowns of some of these could be off, so consider that.  
---
Here are the priest racial abilities in classic:  
---
\[Horde\]  
---
Undead:  
---
* Level 10: [Touch of Weakness](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19266/touch-of-weakness) — The next melee attack on the caster will cause 64 Shadow damage and reduce the damage caused by the attacker by 20 for 2 min.
---
* Level 20: [Devouring Plague](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19280/devouring-plague)  — Afflicts the target with a disease that causes 904 Shadow damage over  24 sec.  Damage caused by the Devouring Plague heals the caster.
---
 Devouring plague is an extra DoT effect which also heals the target. This ability is just simply amazing in any pvp or solo situation. Ok in 5 man situation. I'm not sure that this effect is all that important in raids, but it's clear you can't go wrong with undead. Touch of weakness is good in pvp situations or soloing, useless otherwise.   
---
Troll:   
---
* Level 10: [Hex of Weakness](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25816/hex-of-weakness) — Weakens the target enemy, reducing damage caused by 20 for 2 min.
---
* Level 20: [Shadowguard](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19312/shadowguard)  — The caster is surrounded by shadows.  When a spell, melee or ranged  attack hits the caster, the attacker will be struck for 116 Shadow  damage.  Attackers can only be damaged once every few seconds.  This  damage causes no threat.  3 charges.  Lasts 10 min.  
---
I think trolls hex of weakness is, for the most part, just a better version of touch of weakness. This ability is directly cast on to an enemy, and so therefore you have more control over who it actually lands on.  
---
shadowguard is a very unique spell for priests and serves a similar role to shaman's lightning shield. It is decent in pvp, but probably less so than devouring plague. Because of the haste that priests get from their normal racial, trolls are overall better than undead in pve situations... I think. Both are good choices, but undead slips ahead for pvp because of devour plague and will of the forsaken.  
---
\[Alliance\]  
---
Dwarf:   
---
* Level 10: [Desperate Prayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19243/desperate-prayer) — Instantly heals the caster for 1324 to 1562.
---
* Level 20: [Fear Ward](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=6346/fear-ward)  — Wards the friendly target against Fear.  The next Fear effect used  against the target will fail, using up the ward.  Lasts 10 min.  
---
 Desperate prayer is a self-only burst heal. Effective, but notable cooldown. Humans also have desperate prayer.  
---
Fear ward is a major reason why many people go dwarf. Fear ward is notable against locks, warriors and other priests in pvp, and in pve is generally not very useful, except when it's absolutely insane in a few raid situations. (So, potentially great in raids) For pvp, dwarves also get stoneform for armor and anti-poison, so they are a solid choice  
---
Human:  
---
* Level 20: [Feedback](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19275/feedback)  — The priest becomes surrounded with anti-magic energy.  Any successful  spell cast against the priest will burn 105 of the attacker’s Mana,  causing 1 Shadow damage for each point of Mana burned.  Lasts 15 sec.  
---
Desperate prayer has, I believe, the same cooldown for both races. Feedback is pretty mediocre, but humans enjoy a 5% spirit boost, which is nicer for priests than it is for any other human class.  
---
  Night Elf:
---
* Level 10: [Starshards](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19305/starshards) — Rains starshards down on the enemy target’s head, causing 936 Arcane damage over 6 sec.
---
* Level 20: [Elune’s Grace](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19293/elunes-grace) — Reduces ranged damage taken by 95 and increases chance to dodge by 10% for 15 sec.  
---
Perhaps the underdog on alliance. Starshards is an interesting ability with some decent potential uses. First, if you are in a raid as an off healer, so you're not spending ALL of your time healing, but moreso you only step up healing when things get worse, then you may happy to know that starshards is the most mana efficient dps ability available to any priest race. It's not particularly bursty and needs to be channeled, but it can also serve as some extra dps for healer priests in solo or pvp situations. Starshards is an ARCANE ability, not holy or shadow. This means that starshards MAY be useable in shadowform(unconfirmed by me), and that starshards can be used even if your shadow or holy spells are kicked by a rogue.  
---
elune's grace is actually great for pvp. The ranged damage is not the best, since I think it'll only effect hunters..I don't think it reduces magic damage taken. But the 10% dodge is actually fantastic against melee classes, as long as you can manage to keep yourself facing them to actually dodge.  
---
\-----------------------------------  
---
TLDR- Lots of priest flavor. I'm split between maining a hunter or priest in classic. If I was to play a horde, I know i'd go undead because I personally prefer their abilities AND I prefer their casting animations.  
---
Alliance, which I will end up going because that's what my friends are doing, is a lot harder for me to choose.   
---
Dwarves are the most survivable in pvp, their is no doubt. Fear ward, prayer and stoneform are three things that dwarves can do to keep themselves alive. They are likely the safest pick if you will mainly pvp. Their fear ward is also mvp in a few, rare pve situations.  
---
If you were ONLY ever PvEing, I wouldn't recommend dwarf unless it's for aesthetics or because of fear ward.  
---
Humans 5% spirit boost synergizes nicely with a priest talent 'spiritual guidance', which gives you bonus spell power based on a percentage of your spirit.  
---
Night elves have the more unique and flavorful racials, even if they are a little stranger or harder to use. Nightelves of course have nice regular racials, ...faster death run times and shadowmeld to avoid deadly situations to begin with. If you want to be scumbag, you can shadowmeld near a cliff, and mindcontrol people from stealth, and run them off a cliff. Ah, decisions decisions.

---
I very well could be wrong, my brain has the seventh on it though, I'd have to double check once I get home.
---
Yes, it is a common way to get around difficult zones.
---
Apparently that’s not the norm, no. At least not amongst those I’ve encountered. xD
---
&gt; If you don't know that, how do you know how long Layering will last?
---
As I said, Ion, the Game Director of World of Warcraft, said layering would last "a few weeks".  That's the BEST information we have right now.  Stop trying to dance around you being 100% WRONG in your assertion.  
---
&gt;???? What? The whole point is to plan for drop offs. 
---
You said "Peak population" of clusters would be over the amount of characters any single realm is designed to handle.  What are you unclear about?  You said A-1 would have 9k peak, which is between 3 and 5 times the amount of players any realm would ever have on it.  
---
&gt; Have you queued for LFG or LFR in retail? Do you ever give a shit about the revolving door of people you're matched with?
---
I have met a number of new people to play with queuing up for LFG dungeons in BFA.  Mostly because I actually make the effort to socialize in them (well, sometimes).
---
Maybe have her start in a different zone. When she realizes the journey necessary to find you maybe that will hook her in enough to keep playing, also she won't see you progressing beyond her contest-wise since you're in different zones, apart from the level ofc
---
Did the exact same thing lol
---
Yeah it'd be nice to stroll into Barrens for the first time with an Arcanite Reaper.
---
Take my interpretation with a grain of salt because I don't think I understood all of it either, but I think he was saying:
---
* Battle shout may or may not have threat in classic. It does on private servers, but they patched it out late in Vanilla. If they leave it in Classic it may allow warriors to tank the magic emperor of Twin Emps, which is unintended design. 
---
* Thunderfury will likely not be the threat monster it is on private servers because late patches in Vanilla removed a lot of the threat generation. This means rogues and dps warriors may have more use for it than most Countdown guests have been implying.
---
* Something about rage normalization in a later Vanilla patch that changed how Warriors gain a flat amount of rage just by hitting something - I think he said dual wielding became better as opposed to 2h crit focus that was popular before? 
---
* Deep prot warrior talents may be better for tanking than on private servers. Specifically Shield Slam's dispel causes a very high amount of threat whether it actually dispels anything or not. 
---
I haven't listened to the rest carefully yet.
---
I consider starting in Mulgore to be a - because the quests are spaced poorly. Maybe I just haven’t found the right path tho.
---
FYI, I see no evidence of this post in your posting history or in our moderation history, so I cannot tell you why it was removed. My guess is that you pasted an image link in a text post, which would have gotten caught in our auto-mod filter for a low-effort text post. But, again, it's not in your post history so I have no idea.
---
The Orc Warrior circlejerk was born from years of theorycrafting on private servers that didnt have this bonkers Tauren hitbox.  That didnt have this insane melee leeway. 
---
The combination of leeway + Tauren hitbox is straight up oppressive. 25% chance to resist a stun vs gutting the ability for some classes to kite you makes it much closer for PvP, with Tauren being strictly better against classes that dont heavily rely on stuns.  
---
Here's a discussion amongst some beta testers discussing Tauren vs Orc, start at 2:58:00:  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/434547744](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/434547744)
---
And Ratchet.
---
Piper perry?
---
right? if it were a new instance that was made just for classic, sure call it a world first. but bragging about killing hogger as a world first just because its different version of the game is kinda weird.
---
Yarrrrr, takin back me boats
---
I remember playing on Greymane US in a small guild named Flying Phoenix.
---
We ran Strat UD a lot, with occasional Strat Live and Scholo runs, and also started going into LBRS/UBRS. I remember the guild leader, and I think that our tank was his young son. We also had a hunter who had satellite internet with a pretty high ping.
---
I don't actually remember any names, though.
---
BC without flying mounts would have been perfect , obviously changing the flying requirement quests or giving a temp flying mount for the duration of the quest
---
Thank you. I am aware of these, and decided that Dwarf or Undead are best for me. However, I was wondering if there was any difference raiding as horde vs. as alliance. I read, for example, that some alliance priests were frustrated by paladins
---
Priest(warrior is close 2nd) is the class most effected by factions. 
---
TLDR:  On horde priest triest to fill the paladin role, on alliance priest tries to fill the shaman role.  
---
In pvp, on horde you are the only CC dispeller.  Shamans can make good offhealers, just without as much support as paladins.  They make up for it with good damage.  As a result on horde priests play as a main healer, whose main goal is to remove CC while losing or ranging it to prevent yourself from getting locked out.  You will get focused whenever possible by the enemy team, shamans can help heal you for awhile, but not for ever, and you have to keep dispelling while getting focused.  Your aoe fear is more effective as horde because no wotf or tremor, but you got to watch out for fear wards if enemy team has dwarf priests.  
---
On alliance, you are now the only purge.  Paladins can heal for days with flash of light, or for very high HPS with holy light.  Cleanse is very cheap and paladins multiple forms of immunities and bosac to prevent some forms of CC.  As a result you let paladins do far more of the healing.  Instead you are primarily there to purge enemy teams and help buy time for the paladin heals with liberal use of PWS.  You cast plenty of heals, but you should be looking for opportunities to add some offensive support.  What kind depends a bit on spec, but I would typically spec imp mana burn at a minimum.  Getting a couple into enemy shaman or priest can quickly end the enemy team.  Just like horde you are likely to be a focus target if the other team has the chance.  While your fear is likely to get broken quickly, your racials stoneform and desperate prayer almost makes up for it.  Being able to give a melee on your team fear ward makes the horde all breaking your fear feel somewhat less terrible.  You can expect a bop from a paladin, so a big key is to be ready to range or los enemy shaman so that it does not get immediately purged.  
---
A lot of group fights go to the team that gets the first kill, and the primary target is quite frequently a priest.  A big reason why a lot of people think alliance is better then horde from a perspecitve of balance, is that they that alliance priest has more survival and should die later, and in the event a trade/tie on first kill the paladin is far more capable of solo supporting his team then the shaman is capable of doing.  
---
In raid the differences are kind of similar but much less pronouced.  Dispelling matters more on horde then alliance.  Shaman are great aoe healers with chainheal, so horde priest tend to downrank gheal spam the tank.  Paladins make great tank healers and will whack a mole with flash of light, meaning priest is better are aoe healing and trying to counter big hits with their slower gheal.  
---
Horde you get mana spring and mana tide, on alliance you wisdom and kings.  I think the mana from those two alone is quite similar, maybe alliance being slightly better if you are deep holy since spirit gives spell power.  Worse though, is that not every group gets a shaman.  You can move them around during a raid so some fights you might get multiple mana tides, others you might not get either spring or tide.  Also for horde you kinda want to match your MP to the bosses HP% as a judge for your mana to the fights remaining duration.  Alliance priests can kinda power regen with their higher spirit and by wanding the boss with judgment of wisdom.  So as alliance it might be better to burn off mana then regen it back up over and over.  Maybe even pairing up and taking turns with another priest.
---
Please man. This is flaming and ignorant   Just Google what objective means. Yes you can call something a Challanging epic journey while trying to be objective. Because that's what it is..  
---
Those things are certain, not only objective.
---
I don't have a beta key, I'm not a streamer, so I'm not sure what you want from me.  If layering didn't have those problems, there wouldn't be video of them.  We don't really know how much of that is fixed either.
---
Imagine i was trying to sell you a car, and showed you a video if it driving and all the wheels fell off.  Then I said "don't worry, I made that video 20 days ago, they probably fixed the problems".  Would you still say the video was worth nothing?  Would you buy the car?
---
I don't know enough about the Layering CD to comment on it, other than I am skeptical it will solve many problems.
---
So whats this mean? Warriors are even more OP?
---
Locks just got so OP in Sunwell
---
This is the text font I was wishing would return to classic. They changed it at some stage in vanilla to what people are begging for, but this is the OG font.
---
You mean I won't have the mental capacity to sit there in a wheelchair and play bingo with my retirement home?!?!
---
Was removed in patch 1.10.  Same patch they added the spell penetration trinkets to WSG and changed Nightfall axe to +15% spell damage instead of -60 spell pen.
---
Would have been nice to hear why it doesn't match up.
---
This is the biggest barrier with my wife,  whenever she's seen me playing and killing wolves / bears she doesn't like it.  Thinks theres too much killing,  I don't think it'll happen with her.
---
You can blame it all on me
---
For a beginner, which class is **easier** to play effectively and have fun with: **Warrior or Rogue?**
---
Playtime: \~4 hours/day (solo or with 1 friend).
---
Goals: Raids, BGs and Dungeons.
---
Thanks bro! :D Lok'tar indeed! See you on the battlefield ;)
---
&gt; Always drunk
---
&gt; kinda suck at the game.
---
I think this is a cause and effect relationship
---
Any chance you recall how much each one costs on AH?
---
Personally I'm just going to join the first server that catches my eye when they go live and see if the name I want is available, if not then on to the next.
---
Fantastic luck lol
---
Also. Not choosing server for a guild thst desolves for the same ressons as you have stated.
---
World first classic kills are going to be a thing along with server firsts. FYI
---
No problem.  Glad to help.
---
I've been thinking about this exact setup.
---
I felt it would be druid healing until 20 when bear cleave comes online, then the shaman takes over as primary healer.  Shaman dps early on would be superior, and dont really need the druid tank yet.  
---
Druid would spec primarily all bear tanking and bear dps increases, (with secondary resto) all the way up to Lotp. 
---
Warriors would go fury till sweeping, then respec arms for sweeping.  I agree on the improved BS and Dem shout, could even sync the warrior specs and have one guy spec it while others spec more dmg etc.
---
Shaman I'm not sure on spec.  Early on wouldn't matter so much, definitely resto later.  How beneficial would it be to have the enhanced totems early over resto?  I'd think wouldn't matter too much until WF?  Shaman healing would be awesome later as chain heal would be great for all the melee clumped together.  The +armor heal buff would be even more synergistic for a bear tank too.  Druid tank dropping heals on slow small pulls while shaman drinks would really decrease Downtime too, even later on the druid could pull that easily.
---
The synergy of this group is amazing.
---
As far as gearing goes, your druid would get off-pieces and leather.  Druid and shaman could take all healing gear.  And warriors take all the dps and weapons they want.  Yes you'd have to run the same dungeons over and over for all the warrior pieces....but you are going to do this anyways, as you are grinding these dungeons for xp.  
---
And some of the ones you want to run over and over....are great for melee cleave.  SM?  RFC?  All great for melee cleave and loot drops and xp grind.  I don't really see that as a disadvantage at all.  Most dungeons have the mobs in packs perfect for cleave tanking.
---
Professions, definitely want some DE.  Pool the cloth.  You'd make alot of money, definitely more then questing.
---
Only downside is lack of CC.  This will change how you pull and prioritize targets, and most likely dungeon selection and possibly some bosses skipped.
---
Advantage over the spell cleave is you can actually do all the dungeons to completion with this group, instead of just grinding and resetting trash.  And safer, less chance for error.
---
Undead Warriors are gross though
---
I'm only taking the day off on the 27th.  From 6pm eastern time the 26th I'll play through the night until the end of the day on the 27th.  My goal is to get to 20 within the first day.  Then, get to 30 by the end of the first week and I can ride the wave until maybe 40 within the first 3 weeks and 60 within two months.
---
Isnt the axe spec better for tank aswell? Increases hit rate by a lot which means more threat? At least early on
---
The pvp reward gear is good, its just super hard to get. I think you need at least rank 7 for the first set.
---
Why does this sub have a "LOL Privateservers are WRONG" mentality? If it werent for pservers we wouldnt have classic.
---
Nothing in Eckbert’s post was disrespectful nor did it claim absolute certainty. Get over yourself.
---
Never post on this sub again, we don’t want you
---
These images can be used for Discord bots (item links, raid trackers etc), websites, apps and whatever else they might be useful for. If you're a developer and you have a scenario where you could use these, feel free to use them for whatever without any requirements from my side.
---
No offense but have you done that much research? If you are down to play elemental in pvp and resto for raiding, once you get your full tier 1 or 2 shaman set you’ll be pretty far ahead of casuals just using that as elemental and being patient on the more dps focused pieces once the mages and locks get em.
---
Spell batching was perfectly fine in vanilla due to the garbage internet everyone had, but for Classic it seems to be slightly a mess, unless Blizzard adds in some artificial lag I'm not sure how it will feel right in Classic. As for Leeway it seems fine EXCEPT
---
I get why you're doing it, it's still doing exactly what a ninja would do, *by definition*, rolling need on something you can't use. That's literally the purpose of the greed roll. 
---
And you're removing the ability for someone who CAN use the item, to be able to need roll it, by rolling need yourself. 
---
Yes, there are bad people in the world. But but you don't lock everyone up before they have a chance to harm you. You deal with it if and when someone does something wrong.
---
You can roll however you want. But if you do such a thing in MY group, you will be accurately labeled as a ninja looter. I will let the server know, discords/forums, etc. I will let your guild leaders know. And then anytime I see you looking for a group, FOREVER, I will let world chat know that you're a ninja looter. Because that's literally what a ninja looter is. Someone who need rolls on something that isn't an upgrade, that they can't/ don't use IMMEDIATELY.
---
So good luck with that policy.
---
That's true I suppose. But I mean you should be doing every quest that awards Darnassus rep, no matter how little, anyway. Before they turn gray.
---
I recovered my account in anticipation. Hunter is so different than vanilla I wouldn't be a le to choose it based on how it is in retail.
---
&gt;Maybe people disagree, but I don’t feel any real sense of gratefulness to private servers or the people who run them. I don’t credit them for classic coming back, but if you do that’s fine.
---
Say what you will about private servers. Some of them are just total garbage, run by slimeballs that sell R14 characters. They are still the reason we are getting classic. There's not arguing that point, it's a fact.
---
No, we aren't all losers.  Just because we play games and post online doesn't make us losers.  Alexensual has never been involved in anything enjoyable.  He is constantly bashing everything, no matter if it's classic or private servers.  His opinions are based in feeling and nothing else.  There is no insight to be gained from listening to him at all.  I'm more than familiar with his horrible opinions from 2-3 years ago and I will never, ever watch another one of his videos.
---
The Rogues 'Murder' talent does work on players and so does 'Humanoid Slaying'. Its definitely better than 3% parry chance.
---
So the ability is poorly worded. What base attack power means is your strength which counts strength from items and procs. It excludes any +ap.
---
People are saying that Classic will have a faster experience and it isn't as hard as everyone remembers.  Private servers were overtuned.
---
Don't fucking boost her or give her anything. People often make that mistake and the new players just run after the friend and loot stuff and thats boring as shit.
---
And don't let her play Retail!
---
The way I read it was 1% to crit is less than 1% to crit on higher level mobs.
---
I don't think number or sources matters. Like getting 6% to crit is not inherently better than getting a 3% to crit from one talent and another 3% crit from another wholly different talent.
---
Neither class is hard to play so that leaves it at which class would be more fun.  In that regard, hands down, the pick is rogue.
---
Stealth, sap, blind, pick-pocket, distract, poisons, you name it.  Everything about the rogue is a lot of fun.  The warrior just... smashes things.  /shrugs
---
In raids both classes will be a dime a dozen so neither class really has an edge there.  In dungeons a rogue actually brings CC which is needed in vanilla while still bringing great dps so you'll actually have an edge on a warrior there (unless you're willing to tank as a war in which case you'll be in high demand but as a beginner you probably don't want to start out with tanking).
---
To clarify, yes, wow classic has an updated UI so the current retail mouseover macros will work for classic.
---
The cool thing about spell cleave leveling with one priest 4 mages...all those cloth drops...tailor everyone gear and fill holes with drops and dungeon quest pieces.  You'll be better geared then the guy questing to level, and richer.
---
Yet 2 weeks later you always collectively parrot me. I know its a struggle for you.. You dont have to read my post if they are to difficult for you. So imma just do me.
---
They aren't even a huge part. They ARE the whole reason we are getting classic. Most of them are poorly run bags of garbage pretending to be fan friendly and are doing shady shit behind the scenes. People can spit on them all they want, and in most cases rightfully so. They are still the reason we're getting classic.
---
Bwahahaha 😆
---
Ah I missed the word modifiers and read it as just crit was reduced against enemies 3 levels higher. Makes sense, thanks.
---
And some great spots to farm Runecloth. I murdered so many elfs just got a horsie for my gnome.
---
How would they be able to get it right without the source code?
---
Man I feel like it would be buck wild to roll for 1. Faction 2. Race 3. Class 4. Gender 5. Talent tree and leave your whole role up to chance. What else could you roll for realistically? I thought every talent point at first but boy that would tough.
---
That's pretty much what classic was... but many played for a year or more and never made 60. There really was something for everyone
---
People place the dumbest weight on certain things with warriors. Axe, sword, 2 handed axe spec, who cares. None of this matters. What does matter? Swole-ness. Who chugs more creatine, who drinks more fight milk. It's all about that swole. And it's so obviously Tauren that is most swole. Look at that girth.
---
Because lots of private server players think they know more about vanilla wow than the company who created it.
---
"Mitigation isn't important, only TPS is important"
---
Dead tanks, dead tanks everywhere.
---
Thanks for your reply, that seems about right. Sera seemed quite knowledgeable but his accent made it difficult for me to understand it all. It'll be interesting to see how blizzard messes with the threat values of abilities. If battle shout had the ability to build threat on twin emps then presumably it will have that same ability in classic.  On my second listen through it seems like Sera got most of his information from TBC patch notes that fixed vanilla efffects. This means we will most likely keep them the way it was in 1.12 and have a beefier battle shout than seen in pservers. He also said that pserver devs never knew the threat value of battle shout. So there is some uncertainty but it will be valuable for any tank wanting to know the mechanics.
---
What are you on about mate?  Literally no comment in this entire thread says anything like that.  
---
Are you making up things in your head or are you just so combative that you have to pretend that there's another side to the argument so that you can argue against no one?
---
What’s the OG troll empire? Always thought it was Zandalar
---
You did your best mate 😅
---
Because an overwhelming majority of private server players think the world owes them a thank you and they are superior to people who didn’t play.
---
Not to mention that from the start of beta it has been a constant flow of “wow classic sucks it’s completely inaccurate,” whereas we now know it was the private servers that were wrong in almost every instance.
---
It’s less animosity towards the private servers and the people who made them and moreso pointed comments at the elitists (not everyone) that played on them.
---
If someone is that paranoid, can always follow up with a conversation with their guild and see what profession they are.
---
But maybe you are right about profession drops. You are right in that there is no way to be 100% certain, there.   That was how my server handled those type of rare tradable profession drops in Vanilla. Never heard about any issues with it.
---
The idea is that everyone rolls need not just one person. If somebody, like yourself, isn't up to date with the general loot rules, you can roll afterwards for your chance to get it.
---
Played alliance from end of vanilla through a few expansions. Had a break came back to a horde guild. Was SUPER weird for a long time, didn’t know my way around cities and yeah things just felt different. Tried leveling some fresh toons and had no idea! Didn’t even realize how well I had gotten to know the alliance starting areas and the next few after that. Player horde for 2 expansions, took a break came back to an alliance guild, it did feel ‘Right’ even after the break. 
---
I am now really unsure for classic as well. Both sort of feel right to me. Alliance has the nostalgia but horde also calls to me now.  
---
To hopefully help, yes, after a while I did feel more comfortable after my initial faction change so I am sure it will work out for you if you choose to go alliance. 
---
Whatever you do, good luck!

although those female orc thicc thights hnnnggg
---
But DW tanking is still viable! \s
---
stealth is fun. I personally think rogues are more fun than warriors.
---
This will be my last response as you have proven over and over again you are unable to read anything I say and grasp what I am communicating.
---
The game will be better and more authentic when layering is removed. 
---
As a temporary solution, I have no problem with layering whatsoever and will have 0 negative experiences with it. You, however, will I’m sure find a reason to bitch constantly about it. 
---
Literally nothing I have said in any way suggests I want “the boat to sink.” Everything I have said suggests that your solution is a worse one than layering, and that guess what...you’ll be the one who ends up unhappy. Not me.
---
So quit your “people who disagree have a mob mentality my solution is so good” bullshit and go on about your day.
---
Axe spec is good for OTs who can use Axes.
---
Main tanks Troll haste racial is BiS for threat because your MT will eventually have Thunderfury anyways. Daggers tanking is also not bad and you can get the Dagger skill from Corehound gloves, DM:N mugger's belt, or if dual-wield tanking, Distracting Dagger offhand.
---
Yeah as i said i feel he makes good points for his perspective. 
---
If you were to get into politics would you just listen to one side or would you see what both had to say?
---
Warhammer Online is still the best PvP MMO that graced us. (DAoC just behind, but same creators)
---
WoW is a great MMO and the PvP while an afterthought is still fun.
---
Do I wish they would take more from Warhammer Online than just Public Quests? Hell ya, there's a lot of cool PvP features WoW could rip right from Warhammer if they wanted to.
---
WoW PvP is still a lot of fun, Warhammer Onlines PvP is definitely far more fun, but that game you truly feel like part of a team, a soldier in an army where in WoW you feel more like a superstar fighting other superstars.
---
Sometimes I want WoW PvP, other times I'm craving the team based WPvP from WAR.
---
Which is why I still play the WAR Pserver "Return to Reckoning"
---
The difference is if you are in a group earning loot, and something you can use drops, then you get to roll on it. And if you can't use it, you don't. 
---
It's crazy I even have to explain this. That's literally the whole purpose of the need roll. You're trying (for whatever reaon) to effectively get rid of the greed roll, by not using it, and having everyone roll NEED. Which makes zero sense. Except for the idea that you don't like the idea of people getting things they can use, and getting an upgrade, so you want to greedily get a cut of it by rolling on it. Shameful.
---
I'd replace one of the three warriors with a mage.
---
Free water for you healer, especially with a shaman would allow them to more freely pump out some chain lightnings/magma totems, a tick or three of water after every pull, while the warriors/druid collect up the next pack and get aggro, should be plenty.
---
Past level 40 you get portals so you can port back to a city and sell/train/repair, then hearth back.
---
If the mage spec's frost you also get the control a 3rd warrior with piercing howl would have, while also getting the emergency frostnova if things go wrong or HP starts dropping too fast and the melee need to disengage to get healed.
---
 Because all the pserver players talk like they know the game inside and out and have everything figured out. They constantly use the phrases "viable and optimal" They make YouTube videos about the optimal raid comp being 15 fury warriors and a fury warrior tank and 5 fury warrior healers with bandages. When the version of the game they learned everything on is half accurate at best and wholly wrong at worst
---
Yes, for auras. And another for gear and another for talents.
---
They can still be wrong, just because they were popukar doesnt make them right.
---
100% server economy dependent. You'll have to wait and see
---
* Reduce the batching window
---
* Keep leeway
---
* Layering deserves way more attention than leeway
---
I'm gonna laugh my ass off when the first (and last) dw tank gets destroyed in 3 seconds :D
---
Troll is actually the best Maintank because top Horde guilds are dependent on Tank threat, and Berserking haste is insane for threat.
---
Your main tank will have Thunderfury eventually anyways, so Axes don't matter for him. In the meantime Daggers tanking is also not bad and you can get the Dagger skill from Corehound gloves, DM:N mugger's belt, or if dual-wield tanking, Distracting Dagger offhand.
---
Ok let me ask you one thing. What is the size of a layered server, combined total of all layers?
---
I leveled a rogue to 15 in the stress test and had no problems, my talents were messed up tho. 
---
Anyway, the idea behind leveling combat swords is because you have more opportunities to get good swords through the leveling phase and because you're better at dealing with 2 mobs at once, right? But is sub daggers that bad for leveling? Won't you do at least 40% of a mob life just in the opening with ambush? Also, it seems so much better for PvP and even doing dungeons as you can backstab forever.
---
Personally I'd say Warlock or Shadow Priest. I'll be running one or the other as an alt eventually but both are the best classes for 1v1 pvp or world pvp in my opinion. Shadow Priests can heal a good bit of dungeons while leveling up and Warlocks are always in high demand for their summoning. At the end of the day go with what your heart wants.
---
Lmfao man, the crowd of people saying private servers are going to be harder than retail are losing steam daily...
---
Same reason there's an anti streamer mentality. People are upset that modern users get to interact with something they considered sacred.
---
they have been just placeholder models till they finished the designes. like the t2 set... nobody complains about t2 not looking like a lvl 10 item anymore.
---
only difference is they made 3designes and let you choose which one to get (or none)
---
Sounds like -3% from your base chance, and -3% from your total auras, so -6% total unless you are super unbuffed.
---
OT: Orc &gt; Tauren
---
DPS: Orc &gt; Troll &gt;&gt; Undead &gt; Tauren
---
MT: Troll &gt;&gt; Orc = Tauren &gt; UD
---
It's just not the "cleave group"-mentality of tearing through mobs. Swipe is an instant cast which deals 18 damage to 3 targets whereas cleave is a queued attack that deals weapon damage + 5. So lets say you hit for 100 with your 2.5 speed bear claw, and the warriors hit for 130 with their 3.5 speed weapon.
---
For a swipe you did 100 + (18\*3) = 154 damage
---
For a cleave you did 135 \* 2 = 270 damage
---
Pre-level 30 warriors will also have a chance to proc flurry from it, and as they are getting hit, may have enrage up for an 25% extra damage.
---
Post level 30 it gets even better with cleave and weapon specilization.
---
But do what feels right :) I just dont think the dungeons are going to be hard enough to warrant an actual fulltime tank at the cost of 3 warriors being rage starved and an extra DPS/utility chiming in. More damage means more die faster, means healer wont be healing as much - is my take on it.
---
&gt;anyone in a raiding guild is a neckbeard reeeee
---
Its certainly not one person, you are right. I see more than one person in this thread who shares your opinion. But you are wrong if you think the system I have just described is not the vast majority. 
---
This is how it worked in Vanilla. This is how it works NOW in pservers. This is how it will work in my groups. And I'm pretty sure it will work this way in most or all servers in Classic. Though no one here can predict the future. 
---
I'll say it again and maybe think about it a bit....
---
The definition of Ninja Looter is: rolling need on something you can't use (equip/learn). Period.
---
[That's because we are](https://i.imgur.com/HLNRq8m.jpg)
---
same, finally
---
I imagine far more will make 60 that in vanilla by proportion.
---
Hit level 60 -&gt; join guild looking for more members that is beginning raiding and suits your raid times.  
---
Voila you just joined a raid guild that actually exists, isn't full of first month drama, and play a similar amount to you.  
---
Unless you're looking for the pre-release hype/theorycrafting, skip all the *semi hardcore discord guild* recruitment.
---
Ad hominem attacks won't help you especially when you have no idea that I have lifted weights for over a decade and competed in weightlifting for the passed 3 years. Checking your history indicates that I can put your max deadlift over my head(and I have done it in comp...while weighing less than you you can see a 5 year old post of me hang cleaning~50 lbs less than your squat...then putting it over my head). This isn't the point. 
---
With all this knowledge you have aquired it appears you have no concept of the fact that muscle burns 3 times as many calories at rest as fat. So as the person builds muscle their TDE(if you know what that means) will increase overtime and therefore eventually they might end up in a caloric deficit and therefore lose weight. They will absolutely see a change in body composition as they gain muscle and lose fat in the process.  
---
On to your macros point/can't outwork a bad diet. It seems like you didn't comprehend when I said collegiate athletes and swimmers. You are out of your fucking mind if you think all college athletes have perfect macro tracking. Yet they are still jacked/athletic/strong. This is an extreme example but it still makes your claims invalid. You 100% can out work a bad diet(you might not be "healthy" but your bodycomp will be fine and you'll be athletic). It's difficult and improbable but it is possible which therefore makes your statement invalid. 
---
On to the gatekeeping part. My point is that SOMETHING is better than NOTHING. And that SOMETHING can lead to more working out or motivation to get on a diet or a more structured program which I believe is what the OP intended this to be. You literally took something good and decided to shit on it for no reason other than your ego. Stop trying to make people second guess their decision to start their fitness journey. We all have to start somewhere.
---
WoW PvP was great/popular because you could take all your hard earned loot you got with your friends in PvE and use it to completely dumpster people in PvP. One shotting people is a lot of fun.
---
I don't get how people can even think that pservers are more accurate. I played on a lot of servers, also during vanilla. Even back than, when they had the information readily available, they were far off and seemingly every pserver had it's own quirks and bugs. The first pserver I played on, Soulstone just wasn't working. The next had no abilities for my pets. Another had a bug with fear, preventing dmg from breaking it and yet another had shaman totems only working for themselves. Raid bosses were not scripted and were tank and spank mostly and damage values were pulled straight from the ass of whoever made the emulator.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if developers of emulators and pservers buffed and nerfed classes based on their on preferences.
---
*An overwhelming majority of private server players think this. 
---
*
---
On this sub I rarely ever see these people your strawman pre supposes. I rarely see people claiming private servers are more correct and blizzard is wrong.
---
What I do see are posts like this that have a smug attitude and berate some mystical angry private server player about how they are wrong.
---
Daze
---
No. Just one total. Read the follow up.
---
That's not correct either. It's 3% reduced base crit, and 3% reduced crit from the total of all abilities which give crit. So a total of 6%.
---
That's fine for you to have that opinion. Just saying you better let your intentions be known beforehand. Or you will be branded a ninja looter. The amount of value something has doesn't change the principle.
---
I'm quoting the blue post.
---
Well we just found out crit suppression is basically doubled from what we thought, so we’ll see.
---
You must not read this sub very closely, it’s been nonstop since beta came out.
---
What does this have to do with private servers at all? The post in question doesn't mention private servers, it mentions doing some basic math with some basic observations while following the available tooltip information. Arriving at the conclusion that they arrived at seems to me to be a natural one. 
---
I would understand wording it like this if the post was about comparing something on the beta with something on a private server, but it is painfully clear that this is not what has been done here. All of the testing made has been done on the beta, and I greatly appreciate the time and effort these players have put in to make sure that bugs in the beta don't make it to live.
---
It is a beta, blizzard did not make a beta to "prove" their game is perfect, they made a beta because they are fully aware of the fact that there are multiple bugs present which need to be fixed before a release. Shaming the people trying to help them with this is ridiculous at its best and harmful at its worst.
---
Do it! The PvE rotation is more interesting than many other classes in Vanilla, IMO.
---
Exactly, man. That was my initial thought also. That guy's research had nothing to do with pservers but still gets given a title like this...
---
Because it's Embriel. He has it out for anyone who has ever played on a private server, when in reality he wouldn't even have this subreddit to talk shit on if it wasn't for private servers.
---
Ah, gotcha. That's interesting. Well, I think it is true that they may be frustrated by paladins, but there are still reasons to take them. Paladins don't have ANY aoe heals, while shamans do. Priests are less common on alliance I THINK since some people don't want to get stomped by undead, so that could mean less competition for you if you roll alliance. In addition, the fear ward is a necessity sometimes. Best of luck
---
Talents are auras. All abilities which affect players are auras.
---
Its -3% base crit and -3% crit from the total of all abilities, for a total of -6% crit.
---
You aren't seriously this dumb are you?
---
People pick races based on how they look, what racials they have, and what class they want to play. Pretty simple
---
Exactly.
---
Lol half accurate. Try 98% accurate.
---
All things which affect a player's stats are "auras".
---
Well theres a massive amount of reasons why not, but you definitely should play what you like
---
I'm currently remaking that old site wow-loot.com (Kalibans Class Loot Lists) for classic and, my dude, these are the shit. I will definitely be using these.

I'd say EVE Online is one of the best PvP MMOs out there. In EVE PvP actually matters. You lose your ship if you die and a lot more if you get podded. But that's a small part. What really makes EVE PvP great is that you have player created Alliances which basically function as small countries. PvP is about defending or acquiring resources, territory and prestige. Great wars with thousands of participants are involved in some of these wars.
---
That's quite different from zerging mid in WSG.
---
I used to do this as a dwarf.  I used to do it in Ironforge.
---
Cool, ping me when it's up!
---
DW will be the norm because Classic won’t have highly overtuned bosses that do way too much damage and use their abilities far too often.
---
I think it's because pvp was an after thought that it's so fun. Balance is secondary to your class fantasy. When you feel like a warrior. Killing people is 10x better. When you feel like a warlock it's just so good. I Also really like the pacing of pvp, pre-Naxx. It's fast and, furious not the twenty minute long affair modern pvp is.
---
I also think there is something to the luck element of wow pvp. By this I mean no matter how much more skilled another player is then you are. You can still win. I think thats a bigger deal then people think.
---
I go back to the rats for that one. The smaller rat has to challenge the larger on to play. If the larger rat wins more then 70% of the time. The smaller rat stops playing with him. I think that's true with humans too. I think that helps it as well.
---
Doesn't look like they'll get destroyed judging by how much weaker dungeons appear to be on the beta!
---
That seems reasonable. I guess I was thinking it'd be easier to level as a healer in a guild. I want to do some dungeons along the way instead of just leveling as a dps spec.
---
Undead \^\^
---
I know there was a lot more bugs going on, sorry I didn't get to mention more of them or remember them all at the time. I just have faith that blizzard will be fixing most of those things in any case, mostly wanted to cover the hot topic issues that I hear people talking about. You're right that hunter has quite a few problems left to be fixed.
---
Private servers heavily nerf melee dps anyway. Melee dps will be significantly stronger in Classic.
---
Too much effort, I just press mute instantly whenever anyone walks in.
---
I'll take "shit that never happened" for 400, Trebek!
---
This makes sense as to why tanks on private servers were able to dual wield fury builds.
---
Shadowmeld isn't bad for rogues. It lets you eat while stealthed.
---
Will do!
---
I will once I’m more sure on what I’ll be played :)
---
If not a shaman, a priest is definitely a good second choice.  I just think totems synergy with the warrior cleave is so high it would be worth the spot on that alone.  But that said, if you had a priest as healer, having an enhance shaman instead of one warrior would be worth it.  Backup heals and Rez too.  But less dmg.  It would come down totally to downtime differences.  
---
In that scenario I would think you'd go sham/priest/3war.
---
Until Classic releases and everyone sees how right they were.
---
How is that ninja looting? Its a BoE, I get just as much value out of it as anyone else, why should the good fortune of it dropping only be a chance for some to benefit from and not others?
---
How does this info effect what we know about weapon skill? Does each 5 skill change this crit calculation?
---
Mages was the bar-none best PvP class in vanilla-wrath and we all took it for granted.
---
There's a stigma against retribution paladins as well since most "smart" players will be playing holy, leaving a few good players and a ton of bad ones. Generally, a warrior who is decently skilled will have a pocket healer because they play intelligently, and it's fun to heal a damn good warrior. Those without skills will go solo, creating a bad impression of warriors as a whole. Most of the stigmas in this game are the result of a common practice by bad players, such as the hunter weapon meme, but once you find a decent player, the stigma no longer applies. 
---
Basically any dps class becomes a badass with a pocket healer since they don't have to sacrifice survivability to deal tons of damage, and a warrior is just the largest step up due to the high skill ceiling for surviving the common melee PvP scenarios (and the lack of mana).
---
You don't tank in berserker stance so this doesn't affect dw tanking at all.

HELLO FELLOW HUMAN. I ALSO LAUGH ONE VOCALIZATION AT A TIME.
---
HA. HA. HA. HA. HA. HA. HA. HA.
---
Whoever claimed that private servers were correct? 
---
Everybody knows that private servers are reverse engineered.
---
Holy shit this is dumb to a level beyond explanation.
---
According to Kevin Jordan (who, of his own admission, does not have perfect memory) there were built-in priorities for spell interrupts. This would mean that if a spell interrupt went off before a spell finished casting and both entered the spell batch together, the spell would get cancelled.
---
?????????????
---
Avoid big streamers at all costs.
---
There isn't a doubt in my mind that rogue is easier than warrior. Stealth/blind/sprint/vanish/sap are just some of the incredibly safe abilities rogues have, stealth being the most powerful in general ease of play. Your ability to choose fights is convenient if someone is newer to the game and might struggle with over pulling enemies. Warriors additionally are often pressured to tank, which is the most difficult role in the game imo.  
---
The main downside to rogue are a) other rogues which serve as competition and b) general pressure by your group/raid to always "do more damage" That's the rough thing about being a dps with few utility spells, especially if you're in a guild with less tolerance, is that your worth becomes your dps meter.
---
ill take fresh any day over classic.. .
---
Nagrand is hands down my favorite zone in the game. I used to always log out on one of those floating islands
---
if you are not into raiding there is no benefit to rushing to 60 and getting bis gear asap.
---
so you can do every quest, every low level dungeon, every high level dungeon, max your professions, get your epic mount, get your t0 set as style gear, explore the world, interact with people or treat it as a single player game.
---
treat it like a endless sandbox game and set your own goals. Dance on top of a mailbox till you get gifted 100g, run a quiz in ogrimmar, get your char drunk a d try not to pull mobs in dungeons. try soloing elite mobs.
---
even if you just stick to do all quests solo you will get 10-15days /played for a 15dollar fee. quite a good value fir a game these days
---
Staying at gold mine or lumber mill in AB
---
Tauren gotta keep dem hooves.
---
It could be done, but would require more effort.
---
You could also just buy your shaman alot of good milk.
---
&gt;It's funny to see mobs in Everquest roar over hills and clip through just about every object to get to you - once - then it just makes the game look unpolished and janky.
---
I like that example. It absolutely makes the game look clunky. The people that aren't reading forums and just log in day 1 are going to think there's some massive lag or buggy shit going on.
---
You do owe us a thank you for getting Classic, yes :D
---
Dwarf &gt; Gnome imo
---
You already have imp sprint and vanish for removing roots, Dwarf lets you counter blinds, bleeds and other poisons. They're insane
---
Gd dude that’s some great advice.
---
This forced spell batching they have is not blizzlike at all.  We can see this from the vurtne vids where he uses blizzard and then compare it to tests like these:

---
Would not be bad. My main concern is the mage having to drink between pulls. Especially in the 20-30 range where you mana pool starts going up, but you dont get a decent conjure water upgrade for some time.
---
Having 1 DPS out of the game for every second pull really makes it unsynergetic, but it's a tough call as the free water, disaster recovery and mobility outside of dungeons is extremely useful. I really wish the beta-tubers had taken testing this further.
---
That's because warriors were changed a lot in vanilla, they weren't in the 1.12 OP DPS state until naxx patch.
---
Every time I leveled and alt, I would always start a six pack right before entering STV because I needed it just to step foot in the hellscape (I can’t wait to go back)
---
Most things are wrong in Classic so I suspect this to be wrong as well.
---
Druids really aren’t bad at all in vanilla. They’re one of two tanking classes, and their healing is just fine.
---
Not really, the demo and the beta were released riddled with bugs and a lot were fixed due to reporting. That's exactly how you point out inconsistencies. All we can do is report differences and that passes through Blizzard who confirms whether it's a bug or not.
---
So I'm having trouble deciding between Warrior or Priest as a Forsaken. I have only played bout 2weeks of wow on a Pserver to try out the classes and managed to narrow it down to those two.
---
I prefered the look/feel of the warrior during regular questing, but I absolutly love the feeling of seeing some poor soul who is about to die and just coming up behing him, heal and just go: "Not yet Kameraden, not yet".
---
I'm thinking of going Warrior as I would wager that most Forsaken will go soft classes for minmax and most horde Wars will be orcs (tho than again the fantasy of an undead warrior is so popular they made it it's own class). Plus cloth on Forsaken looks just meh.
---
Warrior? Priest? Pretty sure I'd be happy with either, but what do you think? Since I only tested both for a bit what's the difference later on, besides Warrior gearing being a pain?
---
"There is not a per-aura modifier... There is a single modifier placed on total Critical Strike gained from auras that increase Crit chance."
---
Murder + Improved Slice and Dice is better than Remorseless Attacks and Improved Poisons.
---
God i hate all these private server players doing complex tests on the beta to double check mechanics.
---
I played wow for years, I honestly don't think I have strafe bound anywhere. I cba logging in to check but I'm pretty sure that you can strafe by holding down the left mouse button and pressing A and D or something, changing how they work.
---
Yea I agree there. Getting rank 7/8 playing casually will be tough. 
---
Ill probably end up staying in Black Dragon Mail the whole time.
---
&gt;It feels so terrible and unnatural. It's artificial lag. It's being added just cause "it was in vanilla lol".
---
Ya they have to come up with a better argument than just that. There's plenty of other things that didn't make the cut, so why does that argument not hold up for other things? Just ridiculous already
---
So wait, you actually gave her ANOTHER ring?
---
Thankless indeed.
---
This seems correct.
---
Crit chance is actually 6% lower than on private servers. Bosses have a static 3% reduction they don't have on pservers and also all aura's a player gets have a 3% reduction that isn't there on private servers.
---
Nice, just getting into this podcast.  Just a heads up, wanted to start from the beginning, and can find all the casts on your site. But, when using an Android app called Pocket Casts, looks like the episodes start on #13 missing the first 12.
---
Not sure if they just cap at 100 or if something funky is going on with whatever "repo" they pull your podcast from or what have you.
---
As the other guy said, +spell power is practically worthless for AOE.  
---
Lets be real, when we say Spell cleave, we're talking about Frost mages casting blizz, arcane explosion and flamestrike.
---
None of those spells get much out of +spell damage, having 100+ frost damage results in +2\~ damage per tick of blizzard. Having tested it personally, for AOE you switch into +int/+stam gear for AOE farming.
---
TLDR, Mages are not gear dependent, unlike melee.
---
"Who the hell is walking into the Barrens for the first time on an alt with Arcanite Reaper strapped to their back?" - Me upon seeing this meme.
---
Bud, if that's you in your streams, you're fucking tiny. You took what I said out of context to try to be a big man. Also - I don't dead lift. I can bench more than I can deadlift. I have a bad back, and I've never been a fan of deadlifting. I can also probably curl more than you can even bench (175). Am I cool yet?
---
You're the only one strutting an ego. Everything I said is valid. You're nitpicking bullshit trying to seem alpha, when you're a little as fuck. I'm giving people a realization that DIETTT is key. It's 90% of losing weight. You are acting like I'm saying dieting means CLEAN food only. Diet literally means tracking calories, and watching what you eat. If you love Pizza, and you have 1800 calories at a 1000 daily deficit, then you can go ahead and eat 3 slices for dinner and work around your meals for the rest of the day. It's YOUR diet. You can eat 1 meal a day that's 1500 calories, it's still a fucking diet.
---
Jesus Christ, stop trying to pick an argument when there isn't one to pick. There's no hidden secret here - if you are working out to lose weight, you are going to be pretty upset if you're eating 1000 calories over maintenance every day. Nobody is lean bulking when they are overweight, that doesn't even make any logical fucking sense. You have to cut the weight off and start fresh.
---
When you switch to your main and get killed by the ganker then it is just game over. Time to log off WoW for a bit and contemplate your life choices.
---
I won’t choose, the streamers will. In other words, I will be where they aren’t
---
You can, sometimes, but it would depend on your group and your gear.  
---
Priests can farm DM solo (dme lasher farm), and that's not even a shadow spec, but yeah priests can make money once DM comes out (even without /camp reset).
---
Generally you can make money doing anything.  Drops from dungeons, solo farming for felcloth or stuff like that, or solo dungeon farming, etc.
---
Yeah, and ensure quality control cause Blizzard decided to outsource half the work to the playerbase. On a game they have a reference client of.
---
Warriors also become particular strong because they don't run out of juice. Most classes even with a healer are limited to a certain "pre-set kill limit" Dictated by their mana supply. A warrior isn't like that. They never run out of juice until they die. 
---
For instance they are both really amazing at pvp. However for Shadow priest and, Ele Shaman. Pocket healer or not. They can kill like 2 players before they have to stop for some juice boxes. Other classes can go a little further but for a warrior. As long as some one can heal you. The murder rolls full steam ahead.
---
Man it's sad how easily this can be applied to anything nowadays. "Oh we're garbage at league of legends and getting absolutely destroyed? Probably related to that guy in mid who's playing something I'm not used to seeing in mid!"
---
1) Chaotic but very rewarding. Healers are only as good as the people they heal, and damage dealers are only as good as the healers that support them. 
---
2) Yes, absolutely. Disc priests, holy paladins, resto shamans stand a lot to gain from the items and also have the flexibility to go with damage specs as well. 
---
3) Yes
---
Stuns in vanilla include non-stuns like rogues gouge, engineering grenades etc.
---
Hardcore enough to raid? You mean you can't set aside a few hours one night a week to enjoy your hobby with your mates?
---
It's just Embriel on his anti-private server crusade again.
---
well probably 90% of people playing the lottery swear the next jackpot goes to them.
---
pretty much the same
---
It’s how it’s always been. It’s how it was in Vanilla through Retail.
---
Otherwise each individual instance of you gaining crit being nerfed due to attacking a higher level mob would cripple the player. You might as well just stack AP entirely and forgo crit entirely, since it’d be so devalued.
---
We're not really demanding it, instead we'll probably pick up some pugs in week 2 and see if we can get anywhere in MC.
---
yeah though you need to prepare yourself that hunter in retail is waaay different than vanilla hunter. you gonna have mana again and deadzone and melee weapon and all of that shit. you gonna have a lot of spells but a big chunk of them won't even be used frequently. I'd still roll hunter over warrior though
---
I should have said "Loot tables from kills" are different. I didn't look at the items from the pickpocketing however, just the copper.
---
Can raid trash even be rooted? I doubt it would matter in pve. Maybe in dungeons but melees aren't getting one shot in dungeons off of a root that's gonna last half a second before it breaks.
---
Gonna leave this here for reference

I'm pretty sure it picks the selected customization options on the race you're transforming to. For an example, if you selected Hair 4 on human, it will also pick the Hair 4 option for the Orc morph.
---
&gt;  could you have X number of them to keep refreshing the duration? Does it follow the same rules as other trinkets? Its not unique so it is possible to own multiple of them.

I really doubt anyone's gonna have more than 1. It's very difficult to get one in the first place.

And yet hasn't been mentioned by anyone until today.

To be faaaiiiirrrrrr~

Haha ^^

Endless? I've encountered people you describe maybe 10 times at most in the last 2 months.
---
If you could link some of these "endless" posts, I'd appreciate it.
---
ITT: y'all fucked up
---
As much as I love and prefer my deep prot mitigation tank, you are so fucking annoying to listen to.
---
I think its all the people that never played private servers, that are a bit insecure about their knowledge of the game being able to say "ha, you all wasted your time, and i know as much as you" 
---
Not sure how i can write that w/o sounding like a dick, but i think its gotta apply to some of these posts.
---
Tauren hitbox is only marginally larger tbh.
---
I mean that depends. On if you gradually increase those push ups and, build muscle. The answer is yes. Every pound of muscle you build. Will burn an additional 70 cals a day. Beginners pack on muscle super easy. Your first 20 pounds can fly on in less then a year if you work at it and, that's an additional calorie allowance of 1400. Just think of them hot pockets!!!
---
OP is just one of those people that like to bash private server every chance they get, regardless of how relevant it is.
---
The only thing this means is that people will have slightly less crit from buffs/consumes.
---
To add to this "auras" includes talents. He specifically used the cruelty talent as an example.
---
Calling raiding guilds neckbeards then saying you'll be spending your Friday nights raiding.
---
alright tell me what race you going for warrior
---
Have you played on a private server before?
---
Yeah, I wish there were casual guilds recruiting in LFG Monday as well. I’m a father of two (toddler and baby) and will probably get to play 5-10 hours a week. Most guild posting I’ve seen are for semi-hardcore/hardcore. Which makes sense, because they need dedicated numbers to accomplish their goals. 
---
I’m keeping my hopes up that I will find a family friends bunch of peeps to raid casually when Classic drops. I just hope they are typical on all servers. 
---
But that aside, I plan on having a main to 60’as fast as my casual play style can afford and then having a couple alts. That should keep me having a load of fun for a good 6-9 months. By then, I hope to find that casual guild or be known as a staple in a couple PUG groups that will de some Ony, MC, ZG. My sort of long term goal is to kill Nefarion and collect my T2 set. I hope that is reasonable!
---
Literally everything else in the game...?
---
&gt;I go back to the rats for that one. The smaller rat has to challenge the larger on to play. If the larger rat wins more then 70% of the time. The smaller rat stops playing with him.
---
wat
---
Sort of? It was more mana efficient and you could cast it on the run, but it had lower HPS. So like I said (and apparently like you keep downvoting), it's very much a niche spell. It eats some but not all of PoH's lunch, and PoH was a spell you very rarely used.
---
Yeah hold on dude let me go collect dozens of links to comments and posts to appease you, this Reddit conversation is THAT important to me. 
---
Just wait, be sure you don’t go anywhere.
---
Dude, don't mess up this opportunity like I did. Let her play. Be supportive. Answer questions form a "teachable moment" perspective.
---
I totally messed up my chance, ran around with my main, and killed crap with her. That one night was awesome, and she never logged on again.
---
Make it an event, get take-out, flowers in game, flowers in real life. Shower the cute Pug pet. Tie all that shit up with a bow and keep it rolling.
---
Ur single right?
---
Calling people who get overly serious about Classic raiding neckbeards and casually raiding while tipsy for 3-4 hours a week is a chasm of difference.
---
Most likely because it wasn’t a concern.
---
The best way to think of it is that every item you equip applies a buff to your stats in the form of an “aura”. When a talent is chosen or procs, the benefits gained are done so in the form of an aura. It’s the blanket term within the game for anything that affects your character beyond its base stats.
---
Wow Classic is a different game
---
Looking through your post history you really seem to have an irrational burning hatred of not just private servers, but private server players.
---
&gt; What does this have to do with private servers at all?
---
I think it's more about the clickbait title, than it has to do with pservers. OP knew this would be the only way to get reddits attention.
---
A title like, "Analysis of 5178 hits shows ~3% lower crit chance when fighting +3 lvl mobs in Berserker Stance!" doesn't have the same ring to it like, "HOLY FUCK GUYS! PRIVATE SERVERS WRONG AGAIN!"
---
At least, that's my impression.
---
enjoy that ping
---
its 3% less than people thought, people already knew about the -3% base critical chance against +3 mob.
---
I came here for the comments
---
i'm going pvp, so i'll choose based on the names. eg go the horde-named server as horde will probably be more populated there and vice versa for alliance
---
&gt; I’m not going to get too deep into the specific math on this one, but for the sake of clarity, **I’ll say that this is not a per-aura modifier** and it is separate than the 3% suppression that is baseline against +3 level creatures. 
---
&gt;There is a **single modifier placed on total Critical Strike gained from auras** that increase Crit chance such as those I listed in my last post.
---
i don't know why i said purple, actually i do, it looks purple to me, but im color deficient so i am not even sure if its purple QQ.
---
This is actually different.  OP has spell pen that causes npcs and pvp targets to be vulnerable creating huge damage numbers which was then removed from 1.9
---
Preprogrammed vulnerabilities to specific elements was not affected by the 1.9 patch so these guys in BRD just have a preprogrammed weakness.  Just player specific penetration no longer creating negative vulnerabilities and huge numbers.
---
Spell batching might actually do me good, hah
---
I am arguing against the fact that a company wants something they are actively working on to fail.. that's just not true. Blizzard would love wow classic to succeed, arguing against that is just stupid. Companies don't make decisions like this in the "hopes that they will fail".
---
Owning stocks means shit all rofl, you don't work in upper management, you just watch their share price move, the fact you even brought that up means you've got no clue.
---
Yes it does... What do you think he is comparing his experiment to? The same experiment on private servers lol
---
No beta UI (bug reporter etc.) means it's not the beta, widescreen resolution and good quality means it's almost assuredly not an old video that just happened to be uploaded now.
---
And most crucially the player he's attacking has a Chinese name.
---
Human is also the only race in the game that had Nazi-esque lore tendencies. We could have had fully sentient Goblins four years early and no need for blue squid people from outer space, but noooo, you Humans had to be so fucking racist that the Blood Elves that had been your allies for thousands of years, gave you magic, and fostered the relationships between those "midgets" and your own kingdoms - switched to the Horde.
---
Damn that’s what makes me like them. I love the 2h stance so much
---
I main Blood Elves in Current 🤔
---
It was a follow up to the original post.

https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-berserker-stance/196414/11
---
Anyone practicing Molten Core on private servers prior to Classic's launch, and trying to fill out guilds for progression raiding for 15 year old content are absolutely, unequivocally, NECK BEARDS!
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure it picks the selected customization options on the race you're transforming to. For an example, if you selected Hair 4 on human, it will also pick the Hair 4 option for the Orc morph.
---
While that sounds plausible, I don't think this will be the case, as several races (i.e. nightelves) you have the option of 0-8 skin color choices, but on the undead you have only 0-5. Unless there is some catch like it just assigning NiF skin colo value '6' to UnF skin value to '0'.
---
Maybe I should go dig up some really old WoW videos of people fiddling around with the Orb of Deception to see if the results are the same. I'm quite sure the armor is chosen at random.
---
Yes
---
to a certain point. But the need is not reduced to 0. Try tanking rag with 0 fire resist
---
You gotta be faster with the lip ;)
---
After reading the initial comment chain with the OP I figured I'd try my hand at explaining it. 
---
I think the first step to understanding it might be to, instead of calling it "World First" think of it more as the "fastest official time." 
---
For example: the current Olympic record for the 100 meter dash is 9.63 seconds. Now I can go to my local gym and say I ran a 9.59s 100m. Heck, people could watch me do it, or even video it. But it's not official. That's essentially what people on private servers have been doing for the last 15 years. Training for speed runs, opening brand new servers to see just how fast they can get it down, and even documenting it. But its never been official. 
---
So, back when World of Warcraft officially released, Ragnaros remained undefeated for 154 days (according to my Google search). Obviously the competitive scene of WoW raiding has changed monumentally and is light-years more competitive than it was in 2005. People have been training and unofficially beating that record for nearly 15 years. 
---
Now, imagine it was announced that the world was going to have JUST ONE more Olympic competition. One more chance to set new records. There's obviously gonna be a handful of server firsts, and those are neat, but there's only gonna be one guild to set the new official World First (read: fastest) Ragnaros kill (and all the other bosses of course). 
---
Hopefully that helped lol. I had a lot of fun hyping myself up typing it out, and at least it used up a few more minutes of my 7 week wait for Classic to drop. I'm not pushing any firsts, I like to take my time and do my thing while I level, but just like watching Lewis Hamilton go 225 miles per hour in a formula one car, sometimes it's just impressive to see just how fast people can go.
---
You definitely can join a guild to level up in, it's fun doing dungeons with the same people regularly. Just take raiding guilds forming with everything worked out that have never played together before with a large grain of salt.
---
No troll beastrace - I like how you think
---
To be feeaaahh
---
Normal Brain: Ganking a lower level player
---
Big Brain: Corpse camping a lower level player you ganked
---
Colossal Brain: Running away before the lower level player brings his main
---
Galaxy Brain: Immediately logging into your main and ganking the lower levels main when he comes to gank you
---
Supreme Transcendant Brain: run around on your alt as bait while your homies lie in wait in the shadows to corpse camp the guys main
---
So it's being "tipsy" that makes it "not neckbeardy"? I guarantee the "neckbeards will finish the raid in half the time "tipsy raiders" will, ergo less neckbeardness.
---
Well I'll be running my groups and I'll have a macro stating the rules. And that will be that for a need roll on bop must be prim spec. And need roll for boe/tradable items must be equipped/learned immediately.  No rolling for your alt. No rolling for a lvl 55 weapon if you're lvl 54. No learning a 300 enchant item when you're 225. Just so there are no misunderstandings...
---
But I am telling you. This was the norm in Vanilla. This is the norm on pserv. And I'm pretty sure it will be the norm in Classic. 
---
But you're certainly free to start your own group and have your own rules. I'm just saying you might want to make sure everyone knows those rules before a drop happens. They have a right to know before they group, really. Because what you're describing is *the point and purpose* of a GREED roll. Rolling on something you want to sell. 
---
You're the one who will be going against the norm,  not I.
---
No, this guy has a hate boner for people who have played on private servers for some reason. Just look at this post history. 
---
Someone hurt this person :(
---
I mean it was terrible the other way you had spiders in WotLK that were higher level than Vanilla bosses. The whole immersion doesn’t make sense when you raise the level caps and keep content at its previous level. How you gonna tell me a yeti in a cave is tougher than Arthas? The immersion always sucks when you have this type of progression. They just said to hell with it since it already makes no sense and make the mob scale.
---
God forbid players test things on a test server
---
If I clear molten core before the end of the year I'll be amazed with myself. I definitely wanna take my time with the leveling. 
---
I imagine that there will be a good few people that do attempt it, though; just for the bragging rights alone
---
A corporation that big isn't some being with one mind, as you seem to think.  I think that in general they want it to succeed, but it doesn't mean they give a shit about "the vanilla experience" etc.  They've shown with retail they are perfectly fine trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator of player.
---
&gt;Owning stocks means shit all rofl, you don't work in upper management, you just watch their share price move, the fact you even brought that up means you've got no clue.
---
I mean... I've made money on it? So i guess you're wrong?
---
Wangchief over here really stirrin up a ruckus.

He's comparing it to the tooltip.

Like 60 guilds cleared Naxx in Vanilla retail. I doubt any of them were the "casual laid back" type.
---
Lol bud, you can bench my bench (375) plus my squat ? Or did you mean each separately? Either way, if you're the guy in those streams, you aren't benching anything more than 225. You can lie to the internet, but I can tell by looks. If that's a decade of lifting, Jesus Christ man, give it up. You look like you've been working out for 3 months.
---
 I never said it's too fucking late you retard, stop trying to turn this around and make it like I'm some elitist. It was a simple comment, that obviously I exaggerated. Doesn't change the fact that if you eat more than u burn, you aren't losing weight. Period.
---
I am always willing to help people get started both online and irl. The problem is, irl people listen to me - they see a massive guy with arms bigger than their head, who knows wtf he's talking about. Online, however, it's you kids who have been working out on and off for like a year, who think they are broscience. I'm done responding to you, you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
That’s your interpretation. I need it as much as anyone else. Whether I respec into alchemy because of that recipe or have an alt that has alchemy or share accounts with my guild alchemist.
---
None of that is any of your business.
---
I also have no way of verifying if you are actually an alchemist in that moment.
---
So no. I need it as much as anyone else there.
---
You have your opinion I have mine.
---
And that’s just one example. What about caster items and priests? Or melee two handers and hunters? Need are four letters, friend. They don’t convey the entire complexity of hundreds and items, millions of possible group compositions and God knows how many general situations.
---
**Nobody is talking about selling that flask drop**. That point is irrelevant. There are other options than being an alchemist at that moment or selling it for mad profit. What if the alchemist is missing 10 skill points? Is he suddenly not eligible? What if he respecced two days ago and is at 150 skill? What if he planned to respec anyway?
---
Who the fuck cares about a blue SM drop on a server they is literally dead?
---
&gt;	If they refuse to, they would be kicked from group and branded a ninja looter. It's that simple.
---
People like you deserve to be banned from social media and chat rooms. You don’t get to define what is a ninja. *The entire community does*.
---
It's still an overall reduction in crit compared to private servers where that spec made it's name.
---
Going Gnome mage!

Thinking Tailoring + Skinning then later drop skinning for Engineering.

In order to level tailoring as I level I will ignore First aid. Is this suicide?

I learned in the beta that (for Horde after lvl 32), 2 warriors, a rogue, an enhancement shaman, and a priest is basically perfect for all dungeons.

No what? I can't see what you said.

Hey guys, hope you're all good! I'll be playing classic as a new player. Got to like level 50 on retail last year but didn't really click with the game. I've heard a lot of gassing about Classic and honestly it's sounding SO much better. The big thing for me having not really experienced the game is the no map markers thing. This sounds super fun to me - actually having to explore the map and follow NPC directions sounds WAY more fun (even though I guess I'll probably group with randomers who have done the process thousands of times and know the game like the back of their hand). As a new player on retail, dungeons were crap because people blasted through them at a million miles an hour, where as I was learning the mechanics. I'd die, get flamed, wouldn't get a res, respawn and try to run back, get lost, accidentally pull mobs the group had skipped , repeat (it's fair enough though I can see why people would want to blast through them). I also felt that there was a lot of stuff that was in game but completely irrelevant (class trainers) and the whole experience jsut felt a bit too hand holdy.
---
It seems like Classic is going to fix a lot of issues I had with the game so wanting to give it a blast. I have a couple of questions though and would appreciate any and all help.
---
1) I levelled as undead before and probably will do so again (I really liked the purple/green aesthetic of the towns/undercity). Are these starting areas going to look the same/have the same quests (I remember Silverpine Forest going into the Hillsbrad Foothills were good, F Orkus). I'm vaguely aware that there was a big rework to starting areas a few years ago (around Cata or WotL?) but not entirely sure of the details and I may have even made some of that up.
---
2) Are there going to be any RP servers? I'm light on the lore but have experience RP'ing through DnD - I'll get reading before I dive in. RP'ing ingame sounds really fun to me.
---
3) Mage vs Priest - really struggling between the two. In games I usually play AoE burst with some CC (basically frost mage) or a healer. Was tempted by Shaman but not too into the melee aspect - I think I'd want to go elemental and even then I don't think I want to do this as much as Mage or Priest. I'm leaning towards Priest, just because Mind Control sounds mega jokes.
---
4) This might sound like a ridiculous question, but how important is gold farming? People say mage is good/priest is bad at this. Does gold ever become a choke point when naturally progressing through the game? I was under the impression that gear mainly came from raids and you didn't really spend your gold on gear? I guess you'd buy consumables, but what else do you need gold for (that's important). Are spells THAT expensive?
---
Thanks in advance again to anybody that has helped!

It's not like you brick your character going tauren. It's tougher dealing with the dead zone in melee but you get the extended range at max distance making your hunter really have 43-44 yards. And you get an aoe stun for peel which is great if you don't have intimidation. It's probably not as ideal as orc hunter but people like troll hunter even in pvp. Flower picking is also decent if you go herbalism with aspect of the cheeta.
---
Female tauren aren't that big either if you want to be small in the background
---
Do you want to heal or dps in raids? I'd say if you want to dps on ally go hunter, warlock for horde, and if you prefer healing for shaman for horde, priest for ally
---
Do you have the accurate numbers then? Tens of thousands of people have combed through years worth of footage and discussions from vanilla. They are as close to correct as is possible without have the real vanilla sourcecode which nobody but Blizzard has. 
---
Maybe bosses on private servers are too easy, maybe they are too hard, truth is that nobody but Blizzard knows for sure.
---
I don't have any money or gear, but I have a big list of people that I think are jerks.
---
Asmon has more viewers than Ninja. Classic will be the most viewed game on Twitch for weeks and that'll bring it an untold level of fandom, the likes of which it didn't even see in its original heyday.
---
JOIN THE HORDE BROTHER. WE SPEND PLENTY OF TIME ENJOYING THE "SCENERY" IN ALLIANCE ZONES! HAHAHAH
---
Orc stun resistance OP
---
&gt; in almost every instance
---
quiet an exaggeration pservers are still probably 95% accurate. We are just talking about a view values beeing off. 
---
For pservers who admitted from the beginning that almost all their values where guess work they did an amazing job.
---
pservs already did the original 3%, just in a mechanically different way.
---
Stupid comment.  He doesn't know what he wants and is asking for advice on which one is better.
---
Going to do that quest is almost definitely a time loss over just using whatever green twohander you can get to random drop from DM and staying at the grind.
---
Plus, you need to run those dungeons a lot of times. If you start at deadmines at 16 or 18, by the time you move on to stocks or SFK you're almost certain to have gotten a hammer for each warrior in the party, and the shaman too if you're a group of horde far from home for whatever reason.
---
Unless you only plan to start with the dungeons at 20 when the warriors get cleave. That could make sense.
---
He wasn’t even close to the edge. Your making stupid assumptions.
---
It sure is. I've had a dual monitor setup before, but life happened and I was forced to minimize. I still have my tiny living space, so I've opted for a vertical setup. =D
---
This affects dw tanking absolutely 0%
---
I hate to burst your bubble, but it’s pretty much confirmed that number is more like MAYBE 10% accurate pserver numbers.
---
Orc for pve too.
---
+5 axe and blood rage
---
MISHA!!!!!
---
I mean she already had TOEP and ZHC, the guy we gave it to had better attendance and was still stuck with an Eye of the Beast, 10/10 would do again.
---
Well that was video worth opening for once
---
None of those were essential to raiding. Int buffs did not compensate for the dps difference just bringing more locks would. 
---
I’m just stating facts
---
It’s common knowledge that private servers grossly overtune the raid bosses because private server players are dedicated and can appreciate the increased difficulty.
---
"aura" is wowspeak for anything applied to your character, yes. Buffs, equip effects from items, talents etc. etc.
---
Orc &gt; tauren for maintanking
---
+5 axes &gt; 5% hp
---
\^ this
---
is there a list of all the differences ? fury will definitely not be as good
---
Damn, worth the sacrifice though I think. I've never dreamed I'd have a family until I met her so it's definitely something to think about for sure. Won't be having them for 3-4 years though so I'll get my wow classic time in at least!
---
Spoken like a true Neanderthal.
---
Nope. Nobody even knew it was a thing. Unless you mean they accounted for it without knowing about it.
---
It is clear you don't know much about private servers then, because we know for a FACT dungeons in the beta were much easier then on private servers.
---
FWIW you may want to look at some of the other replies here.
