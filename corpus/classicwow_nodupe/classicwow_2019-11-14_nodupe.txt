I'm largely playing an alt at the moment on a pvp server, level 30 on this character. I'm not too fussed. If im getting ganked so be it, I'll log off and do something else until it dies down or just find an out of the way spot to grind xp.

Actually the comment was about being influenced. This is when someone like a Twitch streamer or Youtube personality shines light on some product.  This is very common when people watch streams of a game then determine they would like to purchase the game.  It could even be reinforcing your choice to play the game. Or even deciding not to purchase the game.  Anything that positively or negatively affects your decision to buy a product you see on stream is being influenced. It is the exact same thing as a commercial.
---
Their reasoning makes no sense. Retail doesn't have options. I can choose to be a heart of the wild healer if I want. Or a healing prot paladin for blessing of sanctuary. I can tank as deep prot, arms, fury, and fury prot. Warlocks can spec for damage or threat reduction and utility, ect. ect. Their whole argument was built on a lie.
---
You realize if it’s a roll they don’t do anything and never have. It has to be a raid leader that ninja looted using MASTER LOOTER, dummy!
---
Cries in shadow priest chugging mana potions
---
Really?  The economy getting absolutely fucked because people are farming gold they couldn't otherwise farm isn't screwing other people?
---
He got fat af.
---

---
even more so. damn.
---
Agility on your gloves is arguably the best enchant for a priest, but it's so insignificant that you'd be better off using mount speed.
---
lava runs skip everything and go straight to the torch room.
---
People generally do them for Emp/MC attun/Dark Iron Forge.
---
They put you just past the 7 dwarves, but you can't backtrack to 7d or flamelash because the door is closed.
---
Who lets a shadowpriest raid?
---
Bigdirty spends all his time despawning the hunter demons for both factions so... yeah I don't think toxic begins to describe this sad guild's failiings.
---
Get finessed, nerd.
---
Vanilla had corpses spell out their site in orgrimmar
---
My main is level 54 and I've been trying HARD to get higher levels quickly by questing even greens at this point
---
Ahhhh yeah my bad didn’t catch that. It’s whatever though we don’t really care, just funny at this point
---
It's quite obvious after playing on priv servers myself that it handled spells and character movement differently (it felt way better than classic).
---
Then again... Joker was suspended from method for being a dick. I kind of like this timeline.
---
Now they just need to make a post on their website. Method unwelcomes jokerd.
---
&gt; Logging is really only used to compare epeen sizes
---
Yeah, you have no idea what you are talking about fella
---
Druid mana burn for one. But there is a plethera of others for each class posted on the forms. Another player has even taken up running the "known bugs list" since blizzard has stopped doing so. they don't all relate to pvp but some of them do. There hasn't been a single response to any of them for months. But most people aren't knowledgeable enough about vanilla to even notice them. I suggest you check them out
---
Are you saying classic is harder than retail?
---
I'm a 49 undead rogue on Herod. Not really worried, worst comes to worst I'm confident in my ability to run away
---
Rouges are overpowdered
---
Unfortunately, you still get notified when you block a channel
---
Well he played a lot more retail than he ever did pservers, so he's a retailer too mate.
---
Also dodge chance and armour.
---
Gotcha, your first paragraph was a bit confusing.
---
I am definitely not saying all this to hate on retail, btw. I don't downplay the amount of preparation these guys put into the game at all. In a lot of ways they go much much further than Classic players, even if they don't tend to play the game as much.
---
I think for the average player--and I've argued this before--that classic can be pretty casual-friendly because the biggest time sink is front-loaded. I just don't agree at all about the most serious players. Whether or not those players HAVE to no-life the game to achieve what they achieve is up for debate I guess, but either way most of them choose to.
---
Yeah idk about that when we have healers like Zaelia in the game...
---
CS - Hemo - KS - Hemo - Blind - Sap - CS - Hemo - CB Evis
---
Hmm, I had one of my pserver characters for over 3 years and cared a great deal about it. Maybe don't talk about something you know nothing about.
---
Bigdirty, same-faction griefer? He still one of yours?
---
If I get ganked on my new hunter, meh it's not the end of the world. If it happens a lot, I'll log off &amp; do something else for a bit, again not the end of the world. Few weeks from now, the 'newness' rush will be over &amp; can carry on as normal
---
this. It's what I did
---
How does one with that serious addiction find a partner/relationship and even father a child? I’m not judging or anything, just genuinely interested.
---
OP is alliance though, so pretty much 99% of rogues jumping him will be undead.
---
Im not worried at all  gankers gonna gank, anyone really ranking wont bother with low levels under 50. And anyone in the 50-60 still has a fighting chance.
---

They were like 14 when DM released

Good, I wouldn't want him representing my brand if I were Method.

Geez check out the thirst on this bootlicker

We can only hope that people who buy gold from a seller get banned.
---
I knew someone who said they made several hundred USD per month from selling gold in original WoW, though; if they didn't get banned as a seller, I doubt any of their buyers got banned.

My guild has gotten leaf 4 times and only one eye. QQ
---
Omg someone posting with a normal practical looking ui
---
6 leafs on the first 6 kills, then finally a first eye….
---
By taking an item in a videogame. Wow dude, lock him up, amiright?
---
You can be more than one thing?
---
Q1) "Multiboxing is only allowed because Blizz gets money for those accounts"
---
A1) Patently false. Even now, with it being easier to do so, Multiboxers are a small fraction of the playerbase. They ban more people for "being toxic" in chat every month than they have multiboxers period. They recently banned a multiboxer friend of mine (before the layering exploit - was for some other abuse before that), so they can and do ban them, if they do something illegal.
---
Also, everyone who says this doesn't realize: 5x chars farming gold in Retail = buying 5 Tokens and NOT PAYING BLIZZARD A DIME. Sure, Blizz still makes money on the initial token purchase, but you have to realize this was bought by NON MULTIBOXERS with the intent to sell it to whoever buys it, 9 times out of 10 being other normal players. Makes 0 difference in profit whether 5 players or a 5boxer bought it.
---
So kindly shut the fuck up with your lazy excuses because a player was bad. This has nothing to do with multiboxers specifically and happens in pug raids too with idiot players.
---
It is a term used in marketing to describe someone that is in the public eye and can be used to sell their product. Celebrities were the primary influencers for a long time.
---
They're using the phrase correctly, schlemiel.
---

---
You can't deadzone in classic due to how the leeway mechanics are implemented, your melee range is bigger than your charge minimum range when moving forwards (You can melee from about 9 yards). The leeway affects the minimum range of charge as well, making it around 11 to 12 yards, but you can instantly turn it off by letting go of your movement keys and the minimum range will shrink back to 8 yards.
---
I created a troll but org seems way less populated than the stormwind in this pic
---
I absolutely had an item returned to me that was stolen by a guild hosting a pug after I won the roll. It was the train boss in WoD or whatever. I opened a ticket and received the item a day or two later in the mail. I forget how I know this, but pretty sure the master looter got a 3 day ban.
---
Holy crap how on earth did I forget this happened.
---
No. It was because he was acting shitty in general. Read the posts.
---
You got downvoted here but I very much agree. No one likes to hear the truth I guess.
---
Yeah, Staysafe is a sperg and so are his followers so it shouldn't shock anyone.
---
Aww shit. I played with you guys during BT progression for us. Elgaler, fury warrior. Cool to see you guys playing.
---
It’s basically to ensure the integrity of the community.  Black listing is only somewhat effective, someone could potentially get away with ninjaing multiple times and this just erodes the communities trust in joining random groups.  Basically isolates everyone to their guild or friends if it’s allowed.
---
Tbf, to most of the world, all streamers are nobodies.
---
Stormwind is not this populated normally. This is a weird moment he screenshoted.
---
Oh my bad, I thought it was a different class.
---
It’s already horrible on Arugal. I’m a 55 Mage.
---
2500 queue to get in last night, every quest location was full. Multiple 60’s from opposing factions patrolling popular questing spots and ganking on sight.
---
This is greaaaat...
---
But for some reason, I’m still enjoying the challenge. If it gets too much I might just have to start levelling other alts waiting for some of the hysteria to die off.
---
Weekly Feenix BWL GDKP is how I kept my consumables funded for Naxx back in the day. I'll never forget Empowered Leggings selling for 12.5k to a priest.

---
Then why are you commenting? You're talking out of your ass
---
It's funny, I play in a guild made up mostly of private server veterans and find a lot of the retail players that have joined our ranks to be exactly how you describe private server players. They've given retail players quite a bad rep among my group of friends.
---
I feel like the loss of community that retail experienced because of things like the dungeon and raid finders and everything being x-realm has made a lot of retail players not care about the way they act.
---
If they can't compete when it comes to the easiest things then how good can they actually be?
---
Ironic...
---
I’ve had an item returned to me this exact same way. Should try for another GM.
---
This guy gets it.  If you read a review and decide to get it because the review was positive then you were influenced.  If you buy a Snickers bar because you laughed at the commercial with Danny Devito then you were influenced.  People are influenced all the time and they don't even know it.
---
Naw the way chat works now and all the combat log options was not like this in vanilla. Comes from the client classic is built on
---
But #nochanges right?
---
Hahaha got em!
---
Im not, 1 DoT and im generally dead vs casters.
---
That's fair, although that's not really the point of my discussion with Toast-Orange
---
No one is being locked up. Proportional consequences are happening. He's lost his sponsorship over his actions.
---
His choice now is to change his behavior and become a better person or stay oblivious and be ostracized from the community forever.
---
Don't you have a server discord and reddit?
---
Try finding the server discord
---
That's no worse than their outcomes in a DKP system. If all mages have 200 more DKP but no new gear, it just makes bids for the next item to drop higher, cancelling out the extra DKP.
---
I get nothing, 100% of nothing. Everything including all the trash that drops is auctioned off and put into gold pot. I do however provide the repair bots etc out of my own pocket
---
I hate the 6 hour CD on the buff. Too many guilds want that buff for their raid, but can't get it. My guild currently is playing around another guild to try and get buff for raid, even planning ony head turn in 12 hours in advance to make sure they get it.
---
Basically end game raids only drop 2-4 items per boss. Often it’s specific for one class. Usually for guild groups they use some type of system to assign loot, for random groups they typically roll for items. Taking an item outside of the rules or without wining the roll is considered “ninja looting”
---
/u/araxom one last happy customer it seems.
---
Glad to hear you got unbanned, I've been where you were and I know how awful it is.
---
There are plenty of gdkp runs for brd/ubrs etc right now
---
I still dont understand why it matters one way or the other. The only people who seem to care about it are people that want to dump on method. 
---
I'm glad they hyped up the world first race and classic.
---
We have 2 Eyes and 5 Leafs so far... We have 1 more hunter to get a leaf for before we start handing them to alts or selling them to other guilds.
---
 He doesnt know....
---
You clearly didn’t test mana burn “extensively” because for example the mana burn explosion in dm wear affects druids in form.
---
This guy is a major piece of shit. Probably account shared to get world first 60
---
I am not a fan of method. I do not follow their gameplay. I do not know anyone on the team by name.
---
I do know, that they have by far the most quantifiable wins and "firsts" of any organization, group, or team. This is what makes them the overall best. Because these things are quantifiable and objective, they are the best, without argument.
---
We had two warriors gquit last night after downing 2 bosses because decision was made to funnel our MT and OT gear they need to push the raid. It's not even a new decision. I was known and discussed in previous raids, it was restated again in discord before the raid. It wouldn't be free, they were charged the average DKP price of gear based on bid history.
---
&gt;	In response to Jokerd's actions, namely his offensive and unsportsmanlike behavior, we have removed him effective immediately from our Twitch Team, and he has been suspended from Method pending further investigation into the future of his contract as a WoW Classic Influencer. 
---
Well, damn.
---
I'm a priest main and I've heard the rumble about druids getting burned in form. I was super curious and decided to test my self. The way mana burn  with druid works (based on my testing) is;
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you start the cast for Mana Burn while the Druid has a mana bar, wether it be travel or regular 'humanoid' form, mana burn will STILL go off even after shifted into cat or bear resulting in the mana being drained, and them losing shapeshifting mana. ONE burn + shift left my buddy (my guinea pig) with 45% mana. 
---
I WAS NOT able to start a Mana Burn cast while they were already in cat/bear.
---
Yeah, failure on management bigtime
---
My favourite part about classic is, the game isn’t shit like retail is.
---
It's because were playing the the AQ catch up patch, so most of the blues are better than the MC drops (except for weapons) Same is happening in my guild for the most part. One of our mages is waiting for the mageblade that hast dropped yet. It's the only thing he wants
---
We also have Mcconnel though.
---
LOL please tell me you’re trolling
---
Dope so it's cool he'd fuck a child?
---
This looks....normal?
---
Wand wand wand wand
---
Are you friends with MLMs or something? The fuck kinda friends are trying to influence you.
---
This is rad, but what's even more rad are those lil dancing sprites
---
5+ hours fo us too as far as I remember, we just CCed everything ,if it’s human it’s getting sap/ sheeped ,elementals getting banished, back in the day we were all scardy cats.
---
There's a few that have been active for that long and still are active, but the one I'm referring to was Elysium/Light's Hope. The specific character I was thinking about was actively played by me for about 2 and a half years but I had other characters on that server that had been transferred over from Nostalrius that were technically well over 3 years old when Light's Hope willingly shutdown shortly before the launch of Classic.
---
Point being, many people put a lot of time into their private server characters and definitely cared about them, even if they did know there was always a chance the server could get shutdown.
---
From their official response:
---
In response to Jokerd's actions, namely his offensive and unsportsmanlike behavior, we have removed him effective immediately from our Twitch Team, and he has been suspended from Method pending further investigation into the future of his contract as a WoW Classic Influencer.
---
So, we still thinking that "Streamer means any attention is good attention"
---
Inb4 "this is all PR they'll add him back in a day or two"
---
I pray you don't play hunter.
---
How can I tell a fury warrior used hs and rage starved himself and thus delayed a BT/ww?
---
People complaining about classic loot need to drink some bleach and kill themselves
---
On my server (Grobbulous) BRD is a meat grinder. AT this point though I may as well since the XP is good. The only thing im torn on is dropping LW even though its at 280 since LW gear rellay isnt that great for engineering
---
Yeah if you have aggro on anything up top before you jump down, it pulls them all down below and then it bugs the whole fight.
---
And when it isn't true that no one has heard of you things like this happen:
---
Which, like.....how do we spin that as "this was good attention"?
---
Usually it’s decided before the raid, but most common methods of obtaining loot in a pug group is to roll for it. He just master looted it. Aka ninja loot
---
Switch Fear Ward from Holy to Discipline so it can be cast in Shadow Form.
---
A professionally sponsored team like Method has no business keeping a member who intentionally violates ethical sportsmanship so deliberately, they will conclude he's not a reliable representative of their brand.  I would if I ran it, he'd be outta there but I'm sure they need to vet it with their legal team assuming there is some sort of SLA in place.
---
Resubbed after 1,5 months to continue my adventure with enha shammy. Swapped wf for rockbiter and it seems more solid for leveling. I am at 42. How do guilds handle memespecs usually? I know enha barely has any loot in mc but i dont wanna heal. Is there any hope for me or is it reroll for 3rd time?
---
That’s what I think every time I’m in org on faerlina. And for whatever reason, it still lags when it looks like that.
---
Same. :(
---
Troll shadow priest is very powerful with shadow guard+blackout. Rogue will stun himself and give you a 3 sec window to try and turn the tables
---
What are your goals in the game if you can't do dungeons? (which means no raids either). Just to hit 60? If that's the case, grinding yetis is fine, theyre easy to kill and spawn very fast. Doing the plaguelands is ok too if you havn't been there yet. There really isn't much nondungeon questing to be had in Burning Steppes.
---
My guild uses a round robin wishlist system. You have three items on your wishlist. You are guaranteed a role on those items. If you win one of those items. Then you can’t win any more from your wishlist baring one or two circumstances. 
---
Tier items are on a separate roll list. If they drop. Everyone from the class can role on it if they don’t already have it. Once you get one. You have to wait for everyone else of that class to get a tier piece before it resets and everyone can roll again( it has happened. Cleared to Shazz last night with 3 hunters. 4 tier pieces dropped.)
---
Finally if a item is not on anyone’s wishlist. Then anyone who can use it as a upgrade may roll on it. This is how I won the Salamander pants for my pally last night. My guild leader was pouting over discord because he has been trying to get that for several weeks now and it dropped in the first run of our raid group 2. 
---
So far this has been quite fair for both guildys and the pugs that join us. Only one outstanding issue so far is one specific warrior has been raiding for 6 weeks has had terrible luck with rolls and still hasn’t gotten a single raid item. There are talks about putting in a fail safe for situations like that. Even if it is just pulling some mats or cash from the guild bank to compensate such a dry run for so many weeks. Don’t know if it will actually happen. 
---
But this is just my experience so far.
---
6 Leaves, 1 Eye. 
---
At this point we have any hunter 55+ with MC attunement on standby in case it drops to get it.
---
Last night a hunter in his first ever MC raid got it.
---
"Suspended" which means once you idiots are done malding, he'll come right back and everything will be back to normal :D
---
oh boy am I drinking those salty tears of yours
---
&gt;Also that little controversy about him cheating to World 60? I believe that 100%. This guy is an absolute sociopath
---
Fake news:
---
https://twitter.com/Jokereed/status/1167688013389946881
---
Calling him an absolute sociopath is also a bit much. He's just a young guy who got into the spotlight and wasn't really equipped to handle it.. and thus went a little overboard.
---
What he did was douchey no doubt, and he deserves the hate.. but calling him an absolute sociopath? He's just an insecure teen who got 'famous' and went too far. Toxic, sure.. but sociopath? Relax.
---
Why?
---
its called hentai mom! and its art

&gt;Does anyone else feel borderline empty after hitting level 60 late in the game? 
---
This is a pretty common sentiment. 
---
Without Battlegrounds or stuff like dailies, all you can do is really farm for gear/materials/rep.
---
&gt;I really want to run some dungeons, but pugging is so painful and all my guildies have moved on to alts.
---
Pugging can be fun, try to stick with all 60's and go with your guild whenever you can.
---
&gt;Am I alone? Any advice?
---
Try an alt, they're a lot of fun.
---
That being said, tomorrow honor launches, so if you like PvP you won't get bored for a while.

Dark runes &amp; Demonic runes are a lifesaver! :)

Roll-for-bis

Priority for item goes to the class where it is BIS for the most phases.
---
Bullshit, i know underlevelled/undergeared groups that have taken 8+ hours to get through a FULL BRD run. That place literally has 18 bosses (not including rare spawns) and is the size of a full outdoor zone.
---
I've done runs of 5 bosses (with key so skipping the time consuming detention block) which have taken close to 3 hours.
---
Yeah he could but I doubt many would see it that way.
---
It's not well-defined because the goal is to match incoming dps and there's no universal model for that.
---
For spam-healing, it can often be modeled as a curve based on the mix of spells you have to use to address a certain level of incoming damage. For cast-cancel, it's more about the interval and the mana regen.
---
In either case, the primary issue is the selection of discrete states rather than the efficiency within those states.

Don't they have a CD refresh? I forget (vanish again)

These times are more for a group that isn't geared or optimized
---
Lol im sorry. I didnt know there was pserver experts that would take offense to misinformation being spread.
---
Calm down boomer.
---
When do bags come out ?
---
If they are so good why can't they compete AT ALL with any top classic guilds?  I don't care about regular WoW at all.  It's a separate game.
---
Not sure how it will look tomorrow, but last night on Whitemane they were mostly on the Thorium side. I ran in from Morgan’s Vigil and got all the way down to the Mc attune Giu before getting got, which isn’t that terrible. Guessing it’ll get worse though.
---
Yeah, every system has its downsides, and this is a major drawback to DKP. Decay doesn't really solve this problem either.  
---
  
---
Having a separate DKP for tier pieces might be a solution, but that makes things complicated.

Where would someone report something like this. I've always only heard that blizzard does nothing for instances like this.

Guy on my server is pretty infamous for being an insufferable asshole, and he just ninja'd a T2 helm from Ony a couple nights ago.

I run around with pw:shield up 24:7 so not worried.

Ahhhhhhh, I'm 51 (Alliance). I tried questing in Searing Gorge earlier this week and I got ganked and then camped for about 45 minutes. Ended up finding a couple of other Alliance and we fought back for a while but I've decided I'm just going to level in dungeons from here on out...... if I can't get a group I'll level an alt and keep an eye on /5 for groups.
---
Imagine throwing your whole career away for a second best in slot weapon LOL
---
If i ever spend 4 hours in a single ST run i'd hunt down my group and delete their characters.
---
They essentially walk up to the boss, get smacked sub-50%, pop berserking.
---
It's a solid threat increase for the duration, and everything counts in a hardcore min-max guild. The other horde races offer nothing useful from a threat perspective racial-wise.
---
I h8 chickens.
---
You are almost at strath/scholo level so running those might be easier
---
Maybe Blizzard should consider renting those same servers as well, considering pservers didnt have any type of subscription necessary to play them. If some russians could rent those servers on donations only, I bet Blizzard could find a way also.

---
The problem isn't really about people hoarding for the next tier, it's stuff like Mages skipping upgrades so that they can win a Mageblade, things like that.
---
Oh, I've met people with that exact same behaviour and attitude in real life. They have to be sociopaths.
---
&gt; Does anyone else feel borderline empty after hitting level 60 late in the game?
---
Dude, it's like the 2nd month in.  People are still running tons of dungeons and doing all types of content.  Your complaints sound like you just don't like the game.  You don't want to farm or run dungeons with PUGs?  What do you want to do?
---
That's not what that's not what bis means means
---
My thoughts as well. I’m like 10% or less to 58 with a bunch of rested banked because of Death Stranding lol

I mean you’re not wrong. But there’s something to say for the loot too. What he did would be like an armed robber murdering someone in a 7/11 just so he can steal a pack of bubble gum. Not only is the dude scum he’s stupid scum too.
---
&gt; I feel like the loss of community that retail experienced because of things like the dungeon and raid finders and everything being x-realm has made a lot of retail players not care about the way they act.
---
Urgh yeah you're not wrong there.
---
I was playing when all of that got put in place and the shift was IMMEDIATE. From people being nice and respectful in dungeons (usually) to "lol fuck you". People rolling need on everything and giving no shits because they had an infinite group of players to screw over.
---
I had always enjoyed joining random groups and making new friends... it really didn't take long at all for me to stop that and only run with friends / guildies.
---
It's sad. People lamented the loss of vanilla because of the amazing communities, yet *so many people* have apparently forgotten that making a good community is 100% on all of us to do. Blizzard can't do it for us.
---
Lol you think anybody cares about retail and Shadowlands ??Gonna be another bust.Ppl will play classic ,tbc or just quit wow
---
Ew...
---
Remember when people just played video games and that was fucking it?
---
I uhh, just walked really far
---
I think that may be a fair middle ground, I can't speak for how the top players choose to spend their time, I only mean to speak to the time they needed to spend in order to compete.  I can also concede that most of the non-essential activities you can do in Classic (ie the things these people would do of their own volition, not because they need to in order to compete) are more impactful and hold more value than retail. That's generally because value in Classic is spread over all content, new content in Classic doesn't immediately invalidate almost all previous rewards like retail almost always does.
---
Shiiiiiit I don't even remember that. Maybe I selectively forgot due to shame now that I know better haha. I do remember that the one week I didn't show up for MC, Giantstalker legs dropped, which was the last piece of the set I needed. I was pretty salty about that for a while. I'm on Deviate Delight Alliance side now.

That group makes Friday night magic regulars look cool
---
I’m getting mainly heavy leather now but I’ll get that add on not too sure on how the AH works tho, but thanks mate
---
Dude is whispering as he streams so he doesn’t wake up dad. Pretty sure he ain’t bringing in the bucks
---
Ah. That's one of the differences between the NA and AS servers. For us, raids are generally PUG based with raid guilds on the side. As I understand, in NA raids are mainly ran by guilds with PUGs on the side. Hence the need for tangible penalties to stop people from leaving the raid once they have what they need
---
Why go back to private servers ever?
---
The apparent definition of my username is irrelevant; you can either get to know me, or let my argument stand on it's own merit.
---
Ok i went out and made you a twitch video of a sample run for you. It was around 1 am , forgot my water and was specced in half holy for raids and in pvp gear, oh and i forgot to turn off the music . But it should give you an idea of how a run could look like.  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/507971297](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/507971297)

As opposed to being influenced by this subreddits hate boner for streamers?
---
There is no better enchant on gloves atm ,he was so clueless.
---
Sell 2 slots to buyers, one to each class. A fee to reserve their slot until they get the item and an actual price for the item.
---
Ninja'ing was rampant during classic. I'm not sure if people never played classic, but this shit was going to happen irregardless.
---
During classic, Blizzard didn't give much of a fuck with high profile ninjas. I really doubt they'll care now.
---
I mean, they'll suck the cock of China but hate democracies, so idk why'd they'd listen to us.
---
Oh right, ty
---
God I hope you're kidding. 
---
Stop attributing people being assholes to something that isn't their fault. More likely the dude is just an asshole. 
---
Blaming every fucking thing on a mental health issue degrades those actually suffering from ones.
---
Would that not remove mining node/herbalism tracking? I could see that being annoying for gatherers if so.
---
Because it’s in a different language
---
U mad?
---
Ur a joke
---
Sounds like a pvp set and arms/prot pvp spec, so he most likely is just a better player than the other warrs, as well as if they are fury and he uses sweeping strikes well then he'll do good damage in mc for the aoe fights.
---
Infinite mana on a mage. We're so underpowered, it's really a common sense change.
---
Chance Starshards into a instant DoT, I cant stand this channeled thing.
---
You're interpreting my critical opinion of a popular individual as "extreme jealous rage" incorrectly.
---
Yeah good thing this guy left EU,no cancer streamers means EU is bliss.
---
I usually assume the great audience for streamer influence are pre-teens and teenagers.
---
Yeah even for casters stuff like Mageblade is honestly overstated for a 1handed caster weapon.
---
Is death stranding any good? I've heard such mixed reviews from people who hate it or people who love it.
---
On the contrary, my opinion on the subject seems rather unpopular here so far.
---
Got away with it.. fucking awful
---
No-one's gonna play shadowlands tbf
---
Hunters destroy rogues.
---
But honestly it's because rogues just love ice. They can't resist...
---
I heard they like kites too.
---
I spend most of my time in dungeons anyway. So I'm not too worried. Though getting to said dungeons is a terrifying thought.
---
The average warrior in that run did more than double the damage of their hunters. Trueshot aura for 3 melees doesn't remotely compare to that.
---
I wouldn't worry much.  For Lv 60 people, only level 48 and higher actually give honor.
---
What argument? "It isn't satire if you're not funny"? I would have assumed that you weren't actually being serious with that and just using it as a snarky comeback because you had nothing else to respond with, humour is subjective and you are either suggesting that you are some kind of arbiter of what is funny or that nobody finds it funny. Both are outlandish.
---
Too bad he can’t ninja loot a girlfriend
---
No. This Subreddit DESPISES streamers. Before classic wow even came out people were demanding to know streamer servers so they could avoid them and upset that some streamers didn't want to choose ahead of time, or couldn't decide immediately because they were coordinating with others.
---
Allegedly. We don't know for sure what happened, or?
---
Nvm found it. Thnx.
---
Someone might need to do a wellness check on you.
---
So now that BRD is literally camped to death what should I do? I'm 58.5 and wanna hit 60 soon. But access to LBRS is nigh impossible with Phase 2. Last night had 80+ ally at the door. I wanna do Scholo and Strath, but a lot of Strath groups won't take a 58 (despite the fact that I've cleared Live and UD at 56-57 \[granted with a good tank and a good DPS\])
---
Nope.
---
A hunter talent tree spec that removes dead one. It's especially stupid when using guns.
---
One is mean to people in a video game, the other harasses women irl and even threatened one with a knife. The fact that you think this is acceptable and just label it "creepy" is insane.
---
I do if it involves defending another person, I have way more important things to do than lose potentially an hour to corpse camping
---
Source for this?
---
7 weeks consecutive leafs.
---
Not at my pc atm but if you just change the line to /use spellstone it should still equip it, and then will use it when ready.

Holy shit how do people feel so entitled?! It's only a game but holy shit says ALOT about you. Good on you Method.

And dps warriors dont even roll or need their tier pieces so thats at least 8 pieces they dont need to spend dkp on.

I bet he paced around his room and screamed into his pillow as to not wake his parents.
---
It's 10x safer than the Thorium Point FP, which often can turn into a bloodbath if you fly in when an enemy raid is sitting there.
---
Not in raid it isn't. Best is to have swap in pieces for riding.
---
Idk trY A TABLE BUD?
---
Fake news, only the popup stops. You still get chat messages like the picture provided
---
They don't even have a guild in classic, or participate in classic content outside of leveling some characters when it launched. There's nothing competitive about PvE in classic WoW, so why would an esport organization participate in it?
---
Also incorrect, the methods by which people sell currency have also adapted to Blizzard's system. Instead of a couple of Chinese farmers hording a lot of gold, gold sellers function as middlemen now, transferring gold from legit players to buyers. They make money off the arbitrage now. No communication is needed in game. Back in the day, having a lot of gold would have your account flagged, but now, by splitting transactions up between multiple accounts who function in more than just gold farming, it becomes really hard to trace.
---
Not only that, I've raided with some people who didn't know basic fight mechanics in MC because their server patched out things like not having the adds in the Majordomo fight become immune to sheep when there are only 4 left. The guild mages were getting bitched at for not doing their job by the raid leader and when he was corrected was just like, "is that new or something?"
---
I only got Searing Gorge FP, so F
---
THIS.  I AM NOT A FOOD TRUCK.
---
He trashed his Elemental Mage Staff, too. If Blizz responds (they won't because it's Method) their action will be to delete the loot in question.
---
What an a absolute tool. Sadly, American politics show us that people will actually cheer on a morally and mentally challenged buffoon, so I don't expect him to lose much followers over this.
---
“Suspended from method” what does that mean? He got kicked out? They all blocked him? He just can’t do raids with them?
---
I guess he got what he fucking deserved.
---
Is that the dude with the pink sparkly testicles or am I mixing up dramas?
---
Personally I LOVE it. For me, it’s like they took my favorite part of BotW and gamified it further. I can definitely understand how some people wouldn’t like it, but for me it’s so zen and relaxing. Plus the soundtrack fucking rips
---
Here is a \[Soul Shard\]. Summon someone that cares.
---
New Activision Blizzard stopped doing anything and punishing people who exploit the game.Hell even if you use bot to earn thousands of gold they will only ban you few months and you can play again .
---
Ninjaing would also get you banned in vanilla but apparently not here another example of how shitty they become
---
"Hey buddy, wanna see the new movie coming out tomorrow?"

Like come the fuck on, at least put some effort into understanding the core concept we're talking about.
---
This is why personal loot is just simply better. But hey, "classic experience"...part of that is getting ninja looted. And no, reputations mean less now than back then, that is not a good way to police this sort of stuff.
---
i want the staff simply because then I only have to click on 1 item to repair my weapons instead of 2.

Except when you go too far and suddenly you're not a streamer anymore.

What small little lives you losers live

Give shamans a casting/channeling animation while maintaining Far Sight.

Lol I'm a skinning priest.  I was going to drop it for something else, but then I got Finkel's and now I'm kind of pot committed as I'm only one of two people with it in my guild.
---
I try to be as efficient as possible with it though.  Drinking takes priority, then I skin if I have time.  I can usually get away with it in UBRS because there's usually another healer.
---
Lol, arrogant fuck got himself banhammered
---
Our fucking pally has one because there were no mages in the raid the night it dropped.
---
You are horde on Herod, you guys will be fine. Its the alliance that are going to suffer. I anticipate not being able to do anything in open world for a few weeks starting tomorrow lol

Man, fuck you! Er all har crazy hours om day1, but this is bullshit. Yesterday i did not have to wait

&gt;They think I care about my reputation is a fucking American server.

Says the guy who lived in a basement and only got famous because of his speedrun, who now risks losing a good amount of his following (and money) because of pixels on a game.
---
Ok since it isn't a 'regardless' issue, the rogue didn't break any rules because there weren't any rules about KEEPING people out of boundaries, only for FORCING them out ie: fear. There's a google docs link for the rules somewhere check it out. Was he supposed to afk and patiently wait for Ven to walk back? At the very least it's hard to deny that the rules didn't clearly define the thing that happened and Ven decided he would passively encourage his viewers to dole out justice anyways. And if the rogue was the big streamer instead I guarantee the issue would be handled differently.
---

Dont exist.

AR just had a new wave of transfers.

no :)

Lesser, Greater Magic Wand, random greens of Shadow Wrath, and the full Shadoweave set.
---
Alliance, not surprised at all.
---
A two second doesn't let you get a free root/heal off? That's news to me.
---
Sounds like a good way for all rogues to wait till the minimum bid is like 1-10. This is why the system has to be all or nothing because people will game it.
---
Got that fool!
---
Good, happy someone did something.  It’s fucking ridiculous it’s even happening in the first place but I’m glad he is at least suspended from his guild, whatever that means.
---
This comment is funnier than what happened in the video. You actually think anyone's going to play retail garbage, especially someone like him who played and streamed private servers for years when they weren't even allowed on Twitch? Holy shit, you have the mental capacity of a drooling monkey.
---
Pardon me, but why wasn't master looter being utilized? Even in a PUG, isn't master looter generally used? The reputation of the master looter does indeed matter, but if everyone knows who the master looter is, and the master looter has a reputation for being fair and awarding loot according to /1000 rolls, why not use master looter in a PUG?
---
This sub is full of people with low confidence. Insulting others is how they feel better about themselves. 
---
Its unhealthy of course
---
Escape artist is CHANNELED, while WotF is INSTANT. Difference is huge in PvP.
---
If you have the chance to log on at odd hours, sometimes you can get lucky and get it before the automated buyers get on.
---
Otherwise I'd suggest buying it, you could potentially spend hours camping it and not get it, meanwhile it wouldn't take too long to farm up 40g~.

force reactive + oil of immolation + thorns + thorium shield spike + sapper charge + retaliation

Pretty funny. I didn't even realize it was an alt. Somehow even more pathetic being an alt.

&gt; Based on the Reddit phase 1 survey only 30% of classic wow redditors have cleared MC

46%...

I have 2 characters, one at 52 and the other at 49. Tbh even though the patch hasn't hit, I already can't step foot in searing gorge without being killed/camped by 60s constantly, so I'm not too worried about it getting worse. I've already had to stop playing since I can't progress, and if/when I do start up again I'll just plan to do all dungeons I guess.
---
I don't understand why everytime someone post a personal opinion piece someone has to link this /r/ it is intended to be for self gloating and misinformation.
---
It is the reddit equivalent to "I know you are but what am I"
---
Well tbh Method should have never even have started a contract with this guy. Everyone could tell even before he hit 60 that fame was going up his head... 
---
(Tho "fck Method" comes off as a bit extreme yes)
---
Rip
---
Idk I'm a rogue
---
Just wondering about battlegrounds I hear that alliance generally have shorter ques and better premises is this true or should I still just roll horse because of the racials?
---
You know what's BIS in the "Not looking like a moron" slot?
---
Reading comprehension.
---
Deadmines took like 5-6h for me and a friend. Was first dungeon for us (didnt play wow before, true wow virgin). Last boss (on top of the ship) was really hard, but eventually we killed it. Found couple of cool guys to help us who were patient enough to teach us what roles each should do in a group. After probably 10 deaths I understood why it is a bad idea using aoe spells on big groups of mobs before tank can do anything. We had so much fun. :)
---
\^ This. I have mining and herbalism and I simply just change the tracking between them every now and again. It's a slight pain, but having two gathering professions and no gold-sink professions helped me get my epic mount money by the time I hit 60 (last night :D).
---
I use Gathermate2. At first I thought it was kinda useless because it was just showing me spots where things might be but often aren't there. The big benefit is really just seeing on the map generally where things will spawn and will help guide you to effective farming paths.
---
Yes because all servers are PvP
---
replace "devs" with "accountants" and its probably accurate
---
I thought the vanilla custom service was always pretty good
---
I've made three classic tickets total and the responses have all been awful
---
one told me to get another another player to "layer" me to resolve the bugged outhouse quest in WPL... the server only had one layer
---
Let’s be real.. how is this any different than the other streamers looting themselves the items but claiming it’s “loot council” lol

Wow what a surprise. The guy who got internet famous solely for being the first 60 in classic WoW and with no real discernible personality would turn out to have an inflated ego.
---
I'm gonna say it. If you play on Faerlina, at this point, you're a no life loser obsessed with either becoming a twitch streamer or obsessed with twitch streamers. I'm not sure which one is more pathetic.
---
Are we talking duels, or are we talking when the warrior has 25% hp and a mob on him?
---
Because I know when I see the most rogue/warrior pvp happening.
---
Or rogue/anyone.
---
Simple fact is, rogues get to pick their fights. And most rogues don't spend much time picking hard fights.
---
I dunno about reputation meaning less now. Considering he lost his only sponsors over this who are trying to protect their reputation...
---
During a hilariously failed Maraudon run I was tanking, I noticed the healer was pretty low on mana during a random pull, and I cast Innervate on him.
---
Except I did that classic panic fat fingering and Innervated the hunter's cat pet instead.
---
I did NOT hear the end of that until the run was done.
---
Are you joking?  Ten years before Twitch, our main tank's wife slept with our guild leader.  People are wild animals.
---
Even if people are at the door, worse case die as close as you can, then Rez yourself right next to the instance and walk straight in. Might take you 2-3 attempts, but no one can stop you entering. 
---
And yes, it can sux, but you’ll get there
---
Not when he ends up losing his sponsor because of it.
---
because purple caster items usually have shit +dmg. only thing that matters is +dmg. you get mana from runes/mana pots.
---
Then I bang ur mum
---
No way. 2019 internet and 2004 internet are completely different. Back then, almost everyone was completely anonymous and proof was super hard to come by.
---
Nowadays, everyone is streaming. Voice comms are the standard. Anonymity is low. Social media (and I'm counting things like Discord and Reddit) are extremely popular.
---
Shut up BIRD!
---
I'm now a Method fan.  Couldn't care less before this about wow guilds as a casual player who doesn't enjoy the arena/mythic stuff, but now I'm a Method supporter.
---
I apologize for assuming you had a baseline understanding that all decisions are influenced so we don't need to bust his balls for shitting on "people who get influenced," but rather consider the context in which is was said.
---
Yeah, it's for the $enediction quest line.
---
So ninja-ing loot is ok. Good to know.
---
Who the fuck buys a keyboard or watches a TV show just cause their friend did?
---
I think they mean sociopath
---
take off all your gear and res your way in, buddy. It's gonna be bad.
---
Yeah this is something that I wouldn't mind as a change. Just to stop the gold sellers.
---
Who cares just leave the raid next time things look bad.
---
Just roll horde. The racials far outweigh queue times. Also I believe blizzard confirmed cross realm queuing for battle grounds so wait times should not be significant.
---
Undead rogue kills human/gnome warlock ue to WotF, but human rogue is still food to druids.
---
Always more leaves than eyes :p
---
Very worried.. currently just hit 54 and am parked inside BRD probably just gonna try and dungeon farm the next levels up.. hardest part will be walking out of BRD, lol.
---
I guess. I'll take off all my gear, too.
---
Also not playing with &lt;18 year olds help. We're running loot council as well and I've never heard anyone complain about anything. As long as a guildie gets an upgrade it's all good for the guild, doesn't really matter if I get it or someone else. We'll all get decked out eventually.
---
For the real no changes, shouldn’t we have GMs randomly showing up to freeze people?
---
Yeah loot council really works great if theres transparency. The loot should be evaluated and decided on before it even shows up on the body. If you have to stand around for 15 mins discussing loot discussing pros and cons who gets what, its already a mess.
---
100% his reaction, all while flailing his arms wide-eyed
---
I play a troll hunter using a bow. Racial ability gives me +5 Bow skill so 305 Total. From what i've read this puts my chance to miss at 5,40% against lvl 63 targets. So i only need 6% hit to reach hitcap?   
---
Can someone confirm this?
---
I main shaman in retail and although its fun having all the totems to use I want to experience something new in classic. My top two are Druid and Hunter. 
---
**Druid** because of the utility, versatility and beast boy aesthetic. I do not mind healing at all and being very useful in bgs for flag running seems. 
---
**Hunter** because using a pet seems dope and collecting pets and the rarer pets seems like a lot of fun. This class also gives me a chance to check out dps roles in dungeons and maybe raids. 
---
Which would you suggest to a semi casual player?
---
5 eyes, 1 leaf. We've got one more priest that needs an eye before we start selling them off. I was really hoping to kill those demons before phase 2, but oh well. We've gotten a ton of hunter tier gear though, so at least it isn't a total drought.
---
Having pet control comes with practice. The best thing you can do is bind mouse up to pet attack/pet passive macro and mouse wheel down to pet passive. This allows you to have great control and an immediate oh shit button nut just scrolling down.
---
Your gear does not take durability damage when you die in PvP. So you should leave your gear on to survive that extra few seconds to get closer to the door.
---
You don't take durability damage from dying to other players.
---
Great.  Yay, someone did/said the right thing!  Keep going Method, how ya’ll feel about Hong Kong?!
---
Got me good
---
Mage t1 is not BiS for the most part. I’m not going to drop DKP on an item I’ll replace quickly only to miss out on an item I’ll likely have for 6-10 months
---
it's the limit on classic right now.
---
Whenever I don't get what I want from any customer service I ask them to help me cancel my subscription/remove payment methods and I find my problems become something they can fix.
---
Game is just too good way better then crappy retail.Also bit addicted to it
---
All leaves not one eye yet
---
he got hit 8 times in 2 seconds. he had 5 straight parried attacks and on top of that geddon has thrash blade effect
---
I wish we had armory.  I agree with #nochanges and not displaying the gear or talent spec, but maybe basic demographics like name, level, race, class, and server would be ok.
---
Get a girlfriend
---
Mage t1 is not BiS. I think it’s only good for the 3-piece. After that some blue dungeon gear is literally better for PVE. I wouldn’t be wasting my DKP on a junker item over a weapon/trinket/ring that I’ll be using for the next 6-10 months either
---
And you need to learn to be wrong, sport. Your self-centeredness will get you into trouble.
---
what does OT mean?
---
Basically he stole loot from his group that should've been "rolled" on by everyone that could've used the item. Typically not a problem if you run content with a guild or friends. This problem doesn't really exist as much in retail WoW, but can be a problem in Classic if you're unlucky enough to group up with toxic players.
---
Probably not something your wife will need to worry about if she plays with a guild or people she knows.
---
I'm not saying I like it or admire it really, just saying that there are really only two ways to prove superiority in gaming. Do something harder, or do something faster. There is nothing harder in classic, so the only option is faster.
---
This man child can't even be an acceptable human being in the game he's dedicated his life to, uh oh
---
pls enlighten me in what fight do you cleave trash with boss lmao
---
This. If I were playing a shadow priest mostly just interested in PvP I would definitely pay for it to get Anathema. Super worth it.
---
Sure thing, just as long as you stop getting so offended, it's really not good for you.
---
20mp5+BofWis or just 20mp5 total?
---
It was years after they gave that statement that they changed it for the authenticator guys
---
Aaaannnd it's gone.
---
Activision customer service is dog shit.. didn't wanna return me my account from 2010 despite me having all evidence and cd keys...
---
First time seeing a comment section?
---
It really doesn't take that long if you have a half competent group.
---
Haha that's right get fucked Allia - er, ninjas!
---
I mean what do you want them to do, give it you on good faith?
---
Druid. Better utility and you'll find it much easier to get into group content on a casual basis.
---
Does he not know its the BiS enchant at this stage, i thought he was a professional
---
Download necrosis, grimoire keeper, and whatstraining addons.
---
Necrosis adds a menu with warlock spells, demons, and a soulshard tracker. Grimoire Keeper lets you know which pet skills you've trained, and whatstraining lets you know your upcoming spells.
---
Do your succubus quest right at 23. Join the Warlock discord server and look at the leveling sections. Look into drain tanking, and plot out your talent build around it.
---
Depending on your gold situation, buy as much +shadow gear as possible as lifetap has 1:1 scaling. I would level your first aid to 225 right away, then transfer a bunch of heavy runecloth bandages.
---
Yeah it's pretty time sensitive. Not only will activity go down, it will drastically drop the moment we get BGs as well, which is a fair likelyhood considering how they handled DM.
---
I would think not as i believe nothing contributes to wand damage apart from the discipline talent and wand skill. But I'm happy to be wrong!
---
[Same thing happened to me](https://i.imgur.com/KUvMnuG.png)
---
No one cares about the pussies who rolled on PvE servers
---
Just another reminder not to engage with people like this to encourage their douchebaggery.
---
Plenty of other streamers on twitch to give your money to.
---
I know nothing about wow but is this the guy that reached level 60 first with his weird fucked up gnome character?
---
Make him destroy the staff he ninja'd if he wants back into the guild.
---
Bro you are not getting in the right groups. If you know where you’re going and are an appropriate level (52-58) then it should only take an hour MAX to do 5 bosses. While the dungeon certainly is big, if you have one person who knows what you’re doing, then it should only take 3 hours to finish the dungeon. The hardest part by far is the room before Emperor as mobs respawn quickly so you need to co-ordinate well with your group. I can understand wiping on that part, but the rest shouldn’t be too hard.
---
Also if everyone is below level 55, you probably shouldn’t be attempting Emperor as it is a hard fight. Much better to do Arena&gt;Angerforge&gt;Golem runs which take 20 mins and contain some of the best gear.
---
H I G H E R!
---
I'd go with moneymaking professions. So basically mining and herbalism. These can get you pretty big stacks of cash, they are however both active professions meaning you have to go out there and find the things.
---
There are a few professions that can make you money passively however the earnings dont come close to that of mining and herb. Tailoring, alchemy and leather working all have abilities on long cooldowns that people pay for.
---
You should also ask your guild if they need something like an axe Smith or armorsmith. It's always appreciated when people step up and cover needed professions.
---
Surprise bitches!Queen sends her regards. love it,seems like a fun world pvp
---
Every decision is influenced somehow.  I apologize for assuming most people understood this concept and we were talking within the context of the video posted in this thread when he said people who get influenced need to get their shit together.
---
no it does not, but shadow weaveing will.
---
Reddit just hates anything that wasn’t its idea.
---
Reddit will happily be influenced by Keanu Reaves and do whatever he is paid to promote to them.
---
It’s marketing and we are exposed to it all the time. It’s just easier to cry about it when they have “influencer” in their title
---
Method had nothing to do with bringing classic WoW back, they're just cashing in on the hype. At least those EU welfare streamers did something for this community.
---
Who said it was?  All I said is he is exploiting to do it.  To farm it as efficiently as possible.  Before he figured out he could exploit the pathing, he was doing 2 pulls.  Now he is doing it all in 1.  He effectively halved the time to make the gold.  
---
No one gives a shit that he is farming in ZF.  People give a shit because he is farming ZF by using pathing exploits.
---
Off Tank
---
It's likely method jumped at the chance to terminate his contract because he wasn't really great for them anyway, why would you want this guy on your brand?
---
It's the same on my server. At peak times it's actually harder to find DPS than healers.
---
Retail does too until flying gets implemented. 
---
100% ground mounts just like classic....
---
Rogues are always overpowered, especially when they are evasion-tanking a warrior...
---
It would usually be a part of a conversation but I felt that didn't fit into the flurry of examples so I condensed it to a single sentence. Here's a Simulated Conversation For People on the Spectrum^TM.
---
Setting: you're on discord with a group of friends, you're leveling together and doing Gnomeregan.
---
You: "ugh, I need to buy a new keyboard man. Almost every time I tab the button double-clicks and I tab past the mob I wanted to target"
---
Friend #2: "I know the struggle, I've gone through so many keyboards too because I would just buy cheap shit but I actually spent some money on a nice mechanical one and I haven't had any issues"
---
You: "oh yeah I do the same. Maybe I should spend some money on a nice keyboard too, but I don't know which ones are good and I really don't want to wade through reviews and shit"
---
Friend #2 "well I use a Ducky Shine X, I recommend it heavily"
---
Friend #1 "hell yeah I have a Ducky Shine Y, don't buy the Corsair or Razer trash that they push on you, go for a Ducky"
---
hahahahahahha oh nononononno
---
 returnofcrybaby hahahaha
---
What a dickhead.
---
I dont think that should stop you from rolling a hunter. It was something i needed to adapt. But because it's kind of embarassing to cause a wipe i quickly learned to keep an eye on my pet and leave it at my side / dismiss it at the right places. It's definitely something that you'll have to deal with tho. Not a idiot-exclusive thing
---
The single ghouls and the elites in the big packs see through stealth. It is possible but don't expect much of a difference because you have stealth.
---
After getting through the fight itself is easy, also be aware of eyes they do not create a message when they see you.
---
Regen is not a constant value and depends on your ability to maximize 5sr and said ability is correlated to how powerful your spells are by virtue of not needing to cast as often to achieve the desired hps.
---
I think that is often not considered and will skew your effective weight more towards +heal
---
I mean hes not the 1st person to do it, So whys he getting loads of hate for it?
---
Yes
---
The quin ninjaing thing was fake the other stuff was real
---
Thanks!
---
the amount of neckbeards playing this game is terrifying
---
Or you could be prepared and bring jungle remedies.
---
oh nonononono fleeceman told them on reddit huhuhu
---
I was hoping that it did, so I used to use a shadow wand with shadow weaving.
---
I never saw an obvious improvement in wand damage or crit.
---
I tried also with and without shadow form and didn't seen an improvement.
---
I'd definitely love to be wrong and go get me Oblivion's Touch.
---
It must be lonely to be you. So little to say and so desperate to get a reaction you like.
---
Yup
---
It's a video game, why do people talk about streamers like they're pro athletes or Nobel prize winners?  Weird shit man.
---
This only works out of combat
---
Layering was to avoid the large player drop off we were supposed to see from the tourist players.  To do this they increased server cap to accommodate more players on the server and they needed layering to accomplish this.
---
I recall seeing added damage on my wand when I had spell damage, but I haven't played for about a month
---
If you spend all your time listening to someone, and then someone pays them to tell you things, well... maybe spend less time listening to them. They've sold your trust in them to someone else.
---
Method absolutely did the right thing here without hesitation. Wise decision. Faith in Method is redeemed.
---
I can see you're lashing out because you're offended, this is why I suggested you stop getting so offended. This sort of negative attitude is probably why you are so upset.
---
You can search the AH for heavy leather.  Talk to auctioneer to open up the AH. Either type the name into the search bar or you can shift click on items in your inventory to put the name in the search bar. This will show you all the auctions currently active for the item.  This give you and idea of prices. 
---
If you get auctioneer, go to AH and do a scan.  Do this frequently, like once at login and the at log out, and the add on will keep track of prices.  The more you scan, the more accurate the pricing.  Also with the add on, when you hover over items it will give you an idea of AH prices (based on your previous scans).
---
BiS how and when?

Announced like 4 PVP realms for the entire EU population. Morons.
---
Have you ever watched Jokerd? fail
---
It's because the yell is zone wide, but if you're not close enough then some shitty sharding tech or something Bliz put in over the years means you see this instead because it doesn't know if the priest if male/female. If you're close to them it works properly.
---
I don't know enough in regards to the context of this raid. Was just sharing a high level overview of how the system usually works.
---
Boss move
---
Meanwhile there is currently a 3-4 hr que atm
---
Just keep on running through, everyone on unbalanced servers has to do the death run to get into the instance.
---
Joker was become irrelevant again after his 10 second of internet fame, guess he was desperate for a thread like this
---
A warrior can come nowhere near a pally tank spamming blessings to gen threat in both single target and aoe. In 5 mans maybe, but not in raid when a pally becomes exceptionally more overpowered with threat.  Paladin tanks have the single highest threat potential of any tank. And the skill required to achiev this is very low.
---
Thanks I’ll do that next time I log on :). Need to start making some gold lv 33 with 15 gold ain’t good :/
---
What a fucking joke. Ban this idiot.
---
Man pshero is a very good Rogue but actually watching him is the worst
---
How long can a pally do that?
---
Damn why am i sad??Be free kitty
---
*Clip of joker bragging about ninja looting plays, then camera zooms in on method suspension email, cuts back to joker looking surprised... Curb Your Enthusiasm theme stars to play*
---
&gt; Now no one will remember this guy in a years time
---
Didn’t know him before this. And I’ll probably forget this was a thing as soon as this post gets pushed out of the front page.
---
Hitting 60 last week felt slightly down at first. 
---
But now refocusing on new things to do.  Hoping for some mild pvp, working on an alt very slowly, doing some fishing, doing a few quests and dungeons to round out gear.  Also helping guildies!
---
Umm
---
So I /rolled on gear and won the roll. I find out from a guildie that the other guy really wanted it. If it was a top tier item, that would be it. This item was meh so I told the master looter I passed. It was looted to me anyway. I traded the item to the other guy. Then he traded the same item back to me.  It's just basic human decency by both of us you usually gain after 18 years of growing up. Sometimes I get enjoyment from something other than getting loot, and I still ended up with the gear I won anyway.
---
I get this could have been a poor publicity stunt, but it misses the basics of playing in a multi-player game that was learned long before 2004. A ninja of this proportion isn't going to be forgotten.
---
I like the guild I'm in and already forged relationships with many people in the server. Yeah I ain't gonna transfer.
---
Why even make this post if not to influence people?
---
Conflag is nasty in pvp, but requires a bit of gear. You're a glasscannon, so you benefit heavily from increased spellpower and added stamina of some T1.
---
Soul link is great for solo play but has limited damage.
---
SM/Ruin keeps you 100% raid viable and is still solid for pvp.
---
Basically every warlock build is dope in pvp except for DS/ruin.
---
I'm currently respeccing nightfall/conflag, then back to SM/ruin for raid.
---
Try turning off interface clicks and just use world clicks. My game didnt like interface clicks
---
1/3rd finding Jed, 1/3rd waiting for rend.
---
A phase 1 second BiS lol
---
I wish berserking troll talent affected wand speed....
---
I'm looking to roll alliance on a new PvP server, what server has high population, and close to 50/50? 
---
Yes I realize this is probably not the best time to roll an alt on a PvP server, but oh well. I've been getting that alt itch, and want to try a paladin or warlock to take a break from my warrior.
---
That dude always gave me vibes of being a creepy weirdo
---
Imagine being in that good of a guild, and then completely destroying your reputation to get 1 piece of MC gear
---
LOL
---
Suspended while they look over his contract for the phrase that will let them fire him outright.
---
**Ohh god all the crybabies who have no idea who Jokerd is and what he does for a living hahahahahaa**
---
As far as I could tell, yes.
---
I bet you PvE’d to level, PvE dungeons for loot and I bet you even PvE raid.
---
How embarrassing for you, you little PvEing bitch.
---
Late 30s and into 40s, you start making more gold.  Quests start giving more rewards and drops start adding up. 
---
Learn first aid and make bandages to vendor.  Turtles in shimmering flats are decent for grey drops. Try to get biggest bags you can do you can keep all the grey items for vendoring.
---
/r/Arugal would appreciate your services!
---
Census data sporadically collected from 1-2 members of each faction shows 60-40, while [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) shows 53-47 and people are taking that as gospel.
---
I made a mouseover macro for Innvervate/heals and boy was the first dungeon run I did afterward rough. Took me so long to get used to it.
---
There's nothing major, just a few breadcrumb quests thrown in to make you aware you can go to the other zones. It becomes more prevalent from about level 45 onwards when Tanaris/Feralas/Ungoro will eventually lead you to Hinterlands/BRD/elsewhere for one thing or another.
---
Don't have to praise them, but maybe don't talk out your ass about how they encourage the behaviour, when they don't.
---
"Ninja'd for the drama" - whelp... they weren't wrong.
---
"Oh no I cant get off to griefing dozens of people for my fun" boo hoo
---
“Man” is a bit generous
---
Pretty much all of them if you want to clear MC in 27 minutes.
---
You sound like you have some kind of stock in this conversation.
---
Warlock knowingly smiles back at you
---
Get rekt noob
---
Horde have a small advantage in 1v1 because of stun resist and WOTF but Alliance have the edge in group PVP because Paladins are a completely busted OP class in Vanilla.
---
It was for sure different back then. Just like Reddit was different before the Digg migration. Or Facebook before they allowed your grandparents to join (at least without a college email address).
---
The internet is so accessible today that people don't realize that it wasn't until smartphones became widespread (early to mid 2010's) that we had everyone pretty much online. Back then, it was definitely a different demographic. Not the least because you had to at least care enough about internet to figure out how to work a computer and set up your 56k. You also need to actually learn how to even get on the internet from someone, it's not like peole bought a computer and knew to hook up the internet, open browser, and go on yahoo.
---
What happens if you die ? Can you resummon him? Does quest need abandoning?
---
Awful. Haven’t played my main in like a week because I am 47 with no hope of getting through the 50s quickly.
---
I stopped leveling my hunter at 39 to Snag Broken Tooth so I could just level with him, it worked out pretty well.
---
This is the classic wow experience.
---
If you don’t want to get ninja looted, don’t do pug raids or do raids just cause a streamer is in it.
---
Usually these streamers aren’t good? Or they are only good at PVP but can’t follow mechanics in raid encounters. 
---
Find a guild, raid with them and you won’t have to worry about ninja looting. 
---
Y’all cap so hard for these dudes that you get pissed when they show you their true colors.
---
You missed the context as to why they brought up the loot.
---
Everyone is mate 12k upvotes and 2k comments insulting the guy. Fuck this website is cringe
---
I'm guessing suspended might more mean. "we need time to look over his contract before we can let him go"
---
just pointing out that the other guy is also talking out of his ass. both are assumptions but the assumption that he’s getting paid is way more unreasonable.
---
It is sad, it's sad that he's this dumb.
---
I don't play WoW but what's ninja'd mean?
---
He didn't get the triumphant ending that Joaquin Phoenix got in the biopic about a similarly named clown.
---
Ok kiddo
---
why are you? lmao
---
Pretty sure you don’t take durability loss from pvp. Or if you do it way reduced. I’ve had a few rough runs in and got in with 99%
---
I just like informing people:
---
5-second rule for priest: 
---
     13 + (Spirit / 4) MP2
---
That right MP2 not MP5
---
And another fun fact: MP5 GEAR ticks MP2 (10mp5 = 4mp2)
---
And a final fact:
---
* Channeled spells of 5 seconds or shorter will start the 5 second rule from the START of cast
---
* Channeled spells of greater than 5 seconds will resume regen at the END of cast (ie a 10-second channel turns the 5-second rule into a 10-second rule)
---
Lmao at social anxiety and mental illnesses. developed at a young age amirite
---
Damn. My life just turned around.
---
Wait, for real? Lmao!
---
Gotta love the elite gamers that think everyone is required to play this game, if you arent full mc gear by the first two months of release then you aren't a true gamer! Give me a break.
---
Speaking as a lvl 60 warlock main, I would roll Spriest. Warlock is great for solo content, but in terms of pvp, dispel makes your dots pointless, and the shard system is a 15 year old system that was phased out for a good reason. Warlock doesn't feel like a complete class, more of a fantasy class they slapped some gimmicks on.
---
Alright, I already have a lvl 60 Druid that I am playing as a tank and am now looking for a pvp alt, because I don't really want to play a tank in battleground nor do I want to respecc every week!
---
I really enjoy using a two-handed weapons, which in my case would mean an enhancer shaman or an arms warrior and for the love of god can't decide, what to level. I really love the feeling of killing someone with windfury, but my fear is, that other than rng, the potential of enhancer shamans in battlegrounds just isn't there, which would make the arms-warrior the better pick, but windfury tho :(
---
Can any enhancers and or arms warriors chime in to give me a better perspective if enhancers really are just a highlight-video specc? Thanks in advance!
---
Kodos. Integrity and ethics is a rare commodity.
---
This definitely happened in vanilla. It's general server congestion or the instance servers being down from back then so one would assume something along the same lines now
---
Perhaps.  I'm actually curious as to what they'll do.  The "politics" interest me a bit.
---
Sure, but not back to full servers
---
He was just being nice
---
Getting to the mid 40s to 50s is when it really takes off, I would say keep it at your own pace, I had friends who got burnt out at lvl 10 so you're doing good, just play 2-3 hours every other day and let your rested experience carry you through the muck
---
Are the guards at lights hope chapel supposed to only attack horde or is that a bug?
---
Just run into BS from Redridge, flight point is just a bit East when you come in, not too hard to reach
---
That’s what’s not is what best in bis slot means
---
Hahahaha.  Everyone knew it was coming.
---
Jokerd himself.
---
it's not a perspective, that's literally just their position. Like, this isn't a matter of debate or what you or I think, that's just policy.
---
Essentially stealing a drop.
---
Some quick napkin math lets say your raid has 8 mages that means you generate 864 threat per cast, this is before reflect damage before auto attacks and seal of the righteous. You easily gen 1100 threat every global.
---
I'm surprised anything is getting disenchanted. Wouldn't people throw in a super low bid? Like 1?
---
Nah dude. If you're trying to do the condescending clinical thing, don't make accusations that are obviously untrue. 
---
And by the way, you're trying way too hard. You're wearing your insecurity on your sleeve, and it's painfully obvious to anyone looking. You're a one trick pony but you're bad at the trick, it's sad. 
---
You have a good night. Drink some juice, take a nap, read a calming picture book. I honestly hope that you've still got a lot of growing up to do. What a waste of skin you'd be if you've already finished.
---
TIL ty
---
I mean, there’s already a mass shooting in the USA more than once a day.
---
Felwood is a warzone, I advise against it personally, but thats a me thing maybe
---
Keep defending a pos. You can go play with a thief and scumbag of a person.
---
F :(
---
Those elementals hit like a truck, so I'm all about CCing those.
---
True that
---
Nope, otherwise all streamers would just be asshats who ninja stuff and toxic trolls. There is a line you can cross where it ruins your streamer career.
---
So... Move it to PMs? You're on a public site, posting public comments you numpty.
---
The king of manipulation
---
What kind of stock?? I get easily annoyed by dumb shit people say, it's easily one of my worst traits. My comments on said dumb shit are (probably) excessively harsh and abrasive.
---
Low grade meme catches low grade fish
---
Yeah I’m not talking about buffing just before someone goes into combat, I mean like minutes before and still getting agro from their tagged mob occasionally.  Agro is totally broken in classic.
---
do the lashers pull with the imps is that why you need to clear them first?
---
It wasnt fame, just his head got to his head
---
This! Horde players are so Damn smart lmfao
---
For the fucking horde
---
or if theyre all green can u just 50% the boss and reset
---
Honestly that’s why I love my server. It has been tradition to publicly shame ninjas. People have been kicked out of guilds and even changed servers because they were constantly blasted in the LFG global chat. I don’t love that that is the way it is, but the public roasting seems to work. 
---
I’m never worried to join a mostly guild pug because no one wants to be person/guild on blast in the global chat for ninja’ing.
---
Well I mean they just hired him two weeks ago. Game streamers don't tend to need a very high bar ethics-wise because their fans are kids who love the shock value of "breaking the rules". Likely wasn't a big enough problem until this thread exploded and made him one.
---
It’s not even close to 50:50 m8
---
You're misunderstanding the word influencer i think. I can watch this guy be a dick and it will influence me to be a better person as a response.
---
Everyone takes media in differently, it isn't just people copycatting and idolizing those on screen. 
---
It's just a catchy title applied to popular internet figures because no matter how you spin it, they have an influence on at least some of their viewership.
---
Honestly, I was already struggling a lot trying to reach 60. Between layer removal and the hundred ganks I'm about to catch, I'm thinking about playing retail or other games until it dies down. 
---
But at the same time, it seems like a ton of fun to be 60 right now. Huge raids in searing gorge, tons of wpvp happening. Ill probably try leveling and see if I can get some good wpvp in. If it's not productive that's no biggie, I'll do something else. Haven't been taking classic super seriously lately anyway
---
You would be surprised. 
---
Orgs like method will promise you exposure and access in return for wearing their brand name.
---
What a piece of trash. Good to see he ruined it for himself.
---
Most dungeons on average take an hour at least. Brd full runs can go for 3 hours.
---
At the end of the day he’s a moron to jeopardize his sponsorship and real revenue etc... over an in game item that’s not even considered BIS for his class. 
---
What a clown.
---
6 lockouts so far, first one we didn't have enough "fire entinguisher". Then it goes like leaf, eye, leaf, eye, leaf. Hope this pattern continues for us.
---
Classic is like playing poker with your high school buddies in your parents basement and Retail is like going to Vegas for a long weekend and wanting to leave Saturday afternoon.
---
You have no idea who Jokerd is LOL
---
Bullshit.
---
Blizzard wont share that information as it goes against the Data Protection Act.
---
You are not entitled to know the details of a ticket between another person and Blizzard.
---
xDDDDD
---
thanks to the pet the leveling is quite similar. but endgame and especially pvp feels very different.
---
It's not unsimilar to how shadow priests level.
---
Throw your DoTs and use your wand. Let your passive mana regen kick in after 5 seconds.
---
Keep upgrading your wand.
---
bad player bruhuhuhu told them on reddit
---
Two dots and wand you will save man and life tap less
---
Now do the pally math factoring in Crit heals fully refunding mana cost...so I don’t have to. Haha
---
The cross out \*and\* the bold.
---
Anything over 1 hour for a group of 60s is criminally slow.
---
I have a 7:30-4:00 Job with a 2 year old and constant wife aggro and I'm 60 with a few MC and onyxia clears. 
---
You can totally do it but I understand where you come from. People usually quit around 30-40, it's like hitting a wall. Sometimes you just have to keep pushing
---
Seems about right. Hardmode was when t0.5 gear was actually something people wanted. We run around in AQ catchup gear right now and 30 min strath is definitly not too fast.
---
Over all server yeah it is
---
Yes then no to those accusations.  I'm talking within the context of the thread, I explicitly said I'm not talking about definition of influence, aka semantics.  In context, dude seems to be calling out people who get influenced to steal by shit head influencers like in this thread, not saying anybody who gets influenced ever is weak minded.  In a vaccuum, sure what he said needs some clarification.
---
I already got 1 ring, do I need 2?
---
A legend
---
*Bird up*
---
That’s exactly what they mean by looting disputes tho
---
I seem to remember being able to leave my Imp phased and just using it for mana and Stamina
---
no it doesnt. that shit happened all the time. Like do you *really* need to know the specifics for this guy's story? Theres a reason for some people not liking girls in their guilds because some dudes are just unable to contain themselves and it causes a guild to implode. Ive been in 2 guilds personally where this has happened by 2 completely different parties.
---
People confuse “logging in” with “actually leveling”
---
People can easily get half a level with an hour playing. Even in the higher levels if you’re actually playing.
---
But did u die
---
Not even saying if its okay to cheat or not. Of course it’s wrong. I’m just letting him know why he did it, that’s all
---
&gt;They're recommending Duckys, it would be a fair assumption that they have an above average interest and knowledge in keyboards. It's not exactly a mainstream brand.
---
Lmao. I know it's a hypothetical, but still. I firmly believe the hypothetical "you" probably shouldn't just trust the first person you ask for an opinion... that's how we've ended up in a world where Instagram is a viable business model.
---
&gt; And we have reached the core of the issue I took with your original comment: you have such a narrow understanding of the term "influencer" and "influencing" that you don't consider these situations to fit.
---
I actually think it's more that you don't quite understand the meaning of the word "influence". My original point was against the following:
---
&gt;you probably are influenced to do shit by your friends
---
This is just simply not true unless you're actively wishing to be "influenced", it's not some sub-conscious thing that happens.
---
Did they kick Josh too? He always did really arrogant things but seemed to get a free pass...
---
Guys an idiot and he got his just desserts.
---

there you go
---
Yea I did a dozen or so pugs/guild runs with no luck when I decided to just buy the rings.
---
Lmao that got me to the r/Kanye subreddit
---
IKR. Kudos to Method. Well handled.
---
You can get a fishing rod from those lobster traps that is in high demand on the auction house. And I think it's players, not bots. If you were baiting tho, well done!
---
Apparently tourists don't play on servers with 3 hour queues. Who would have thought.
---
What do you mean? Why would you be totally fucked because you can't play today?
---
Thanks for that! I didn't know I had access to that.
---
I could be wrong, but I believe it relates to your reputation with them.
---
At neutral, they will not help you at all.
---
Not potential, he legit lost future money because of it.

\-Guild Leader M. Scott
---
Dunno, but i went in his channel to shit on him and got a random gifted sub.
---
What dots do you use? I've been using Immolate, CoA, Corruption, and  sometimes Siphon Life if I get aggro.
---
Should have named the guild &lt;Never Gunna&gt;. Then you could have had Tellalie in there.
---
Made a few gold handing out ports before a giant Tauren /yelled AUTOBOTS ROLL OUT and they all took off
---
Thanks. The thing is though, I vaguely remember old Vanilla developers talking on an interview (either ClassiCast or some QA panel) and when asked that, they even spoke about the old torch skill/profession for dark areas like Duskwood, but I don't remember who said it, sadly...
---
There I am!
---
Corruption and agony if you life tap do corruption and siphon life
---
Nothing better than fighting a dagger spec rogue that tries to stunlock my druid with 11k armor, 18% dodge and 6.3k hp unbuffed. Good luck out there!
---
I don't think there's enough tallents to take sl and ruin, and even if you could I don't think you would want to since you miss out on improved corruption, and improved life tap.
---
You blame college girls for getting raped at parties, do you?
---
What level are you and are you specced for drain tanking?
---
Up until you can get dark pact you will be better off dotting and wanding, after dark pact you shouldn't need to drink/eat very often at all. I didn't really use siphon life much, just CoA/Corruption then life taps and drain lifes. When you get death coil that helps too. You should be able to go a fair few pulls before needing a quick bandage.
---
Nope, he got the gold and then his epic mount by selling a freezing band, he never sold the gauntlets, was a fake drama.
---
I'll give it a try, thanks
---
&gt;Sounds like a personal problem.
---
U/Rollz4Dayz, sounds like a dick response to someone basically asking if it gets better or how to enjoy the game more.
---
Its gonna be a real classy affair
---
You're four levels deep from where ever you came from, acting like the outcome of this comment string has some kind of significant bearing on your life.
---
Most of my commentary is just responding in kind to people making irrelevant criticisms of my initial argument.
---
If people instead brought some kind of meaningful response, I would engage in real discussion.  But they don't, so I don't.
---
k
---
I actually have only played gnomes for so long that I can't really stand any other race. The POV from taller toons is super annoying, gnomes have a nice perspective of the world. Oh yeah, we also have a huge advantage for mountain climbing too :D
---
Never liked this guy and never understood why he managed to get into the NA just chatting community like being friends with knut and John Zerka and rajj contestants etc. Hes just a scuffed eu nerd lmfao he streams from a barn in malta u can see the brick wall behind him haha probably got a goat shiddin on the floor while he be steamin hahaha

Removed my own thoughts. It was 4am and I wasn’t really thinking straight. Not trying to defend him. Ninja looting is wrong by all means. Was just trying to share my own thoughts, but i saw how it can seem like im defending him. My b.

Why move it to PMs?  I have nothing to hide.

Hah!
---
Use Swift boots + gnomish invis trinket + lesser invisibility potion and you'll make it thru half of BRM before being seen. Or at least nifty stopwatch + gnomish invis trinket since those aren't consumable.

If he has played 2-3 hours per day and is only in the 30s he isn't doing it right though

Troll, undead are lame AF.

Getting suspended from your professional gaming organization for a single WoW Epic LMAO this dude is 5000 IQ
---
What's he lost? I hear his subs had plummeted anyway and in the past he's deleted his level 60 and talked about how he doesn't actually give a shit about wow/streaming. Seems like a dickhead but it's not like method would have been paying him.

&gt; One bad experience in an MMO playing with other real humans who are sometimes dickheads and they say the whole game is toxic and they won't keep playing.
---
because obviously there are no repercussions to scammers. Why bother? There are some mmo's out there that do ban scammers. If you like a game full of scammers by all means keep playing, the op on the other hand doens't like to play with a bunch of cheaters.

I stone skin your blind and dot as a spriest. How would you react?
---
Originally it was planned for it to work that way. WotF was a passive that made undead players well, undead. This meant they were immune to many types of cc, but were affected by Paladin's undead only abilities. WotF was eventually made an active because it was too powerful as a passive and they were made humanoids so they were no longer affected by Paladin's undead only abilities

nah if he runs into some 60's farming honor on his new sparkly mount hes fucked, lets be real.
---
I don't get why people are acting like he must be mentally ill because he did this, guy just looks like the usual asshole who has spent too much time on the internet and things it makes him above everyone else who doesn't put in the time he does. Add to that a little bit of celebrity going to his head and yeah he's a dickhead.
---
Yep.  And you're a victim blamer, you pathetic shit.
---
Well at that point the parents are living with their kids.

He presses his heal buttons so well, I bet the world would love to see that in action. 
---
Maybe on mixer.

oh no dude its now 15min instead of 25min.

surely those extra 10 minutes he saves is "enough to fuck over the economy."
---
literally crying just to cry.

As they say, "One for the road"

I think he means he will just play on EU servers more any way.

Yeah dude thats it.

Fair enough, I wouldn't dispute that it isn't as active as the other bigger servers.

Hell, my new laptop did an auto update,  kicked me out. It was 4k an hour ago. Fml lol

It's not double, it's 1.5 times, but you have the right idea

Yeah there's a big difference between living with your mom and your mom living with you

If that were the case why do they still have Josh on their raid team?
---
lmao
---
Because they like being superior to fresh faces who don't have much experience playing vanilla
---
Doubt they would have even done anything unless for this reddit post. Let me see someone post about someone of their stature taking action due to someone personally reaching out with solid proof such as this.

Yet, all these people are out to get him over "pixels" -- how hypocritical.

Or even one where Dee becomes a streamer so the guys try and copy her.

and?
---
It's actually passed BRD. You can heal raids in early phases just fine and even sometimes better than full resto with HotW/NS. It's because swiftmend is mostly a pvp spell (still useful) but isnt as good as having +20% int from HotW. Especially in earlier phases where druids benefit a lot from having a larger mana pool in raids. Only one druid should be full resto in a raid.
---
Further on this is that early content (pre 50) is a lot more gear reliant than spec reliant.
---
If you have healing hear with int and spirit and then you have agility/stam leather for tanking you can fulfill any role in a dungeon while you level. Cat dps is actually just fine in dungeons as well and they bring a lot of utility especially if no other druid is there.
---
TLDR:
---
Healing touch is your main spell. You will down rank it as content gets harder. Regrowth and rejuv and good together later in the game when tanks want to do bigger pulls. Or for bosses that hit very hard/in a row. HoT the tank at about 60% then start healing touches.
---
Have both cloth/leather Int/spirit gear and some good agility/stam leather and you can bear tank or heal or cat dps as feral spec. You go 30/31 into feral then 21/20 into resto.
---
No one knows what it is where I live

Are you talking about the the various scandals like hot coffee and such? I feel like those aren't bad press for the people actually buying their games, only the media and angry moms, bad press with gamers would hurt them I think (like microtransactions that probably pushed some people away from GTA V)

I just scroll down reddit threads on desktop my dude, I didn't expand any long comment threads or anything. I just saw some dumb shit being posted so fueled by annoyance I replied. From the flow of conversation it seemed like, when you said "let my argument stand on it's own merit" you were referring to
---
&gt;It isn't satire if you're not funny.
---
which as I pointed out is ridiculous, that's it.
---
I doubt he had real sponsors, he didn't seem to have the best social media presence or personality his stream was apparently dying and he only was famous for hitting 60 not for being engaging or entertaining.

The source you linked has UBRS and Ony keys classified in the same category

On Arugal someone parked old Borelgore’s corpse in Undercity for a few days

He was a feature. People started praising Borelgore. The slimy one.
---
Everyone always says this bro. But I never believed it. Still don’t. What’s the point of a 52 DPS to emp? They’re 7 levels below. They’re doing no damage at all. I’d only do this for guildies wouldn’t take Randoms at 52
---
Hahahaha don't take the red pill

I've played a lock for 15 years and have not seen a feared target fall off a cliff a single time. Everytime the feared player will be stoped at the edge and when the fear wears. The player may then attempt to move and falls off the cliff but I've never seen a fear end and the player instantly fall off a cliff. I could be wrong but I'd be extremely surprised if fear can make you walk off cliffs.
---
That why josh is still in the main team?
---
lol the cringe when you resort to using boomer
---
Gotta stay relevant till BC leveling comes out
---
&gt; But you'd still pay what the other player bid. That's important.
---
But as per your own explanation of price should somewhat match the items worth to you, he has valued the item less than me (or was trying to save resources). Why should he then get a chance to buy it at the value I perceive it at afterwards, and how does that not incentivize erring on the side of being cheap? In the case of the 510g/500g bid, the chances are barely 51% of the person actually bidding the highest winning the auction. I don't see why anyone would want a closed-auction system where you don't actually win auction by being the highest bidder.
---
&gt;He'll only have a ~0.05% chance to win the roll even if he decides to go for it, though.
---
And that's pretty significant! Lowballing by such a huge margin and then still having a non-zero chance of losing the auction seems totally asinine. If he wanted to win, he should bid to win imo.
---
&gt;To me, it's important that this is a zero-sum system. 
---
All GDKP is by design zero-sum. Your proposed changes don't affect that at all.
---
&gt;If you lose a bid by 1 DKP and are disappointed, it's because you didn't bid what the item was worth to you.
---
Exactly, and because the system we were using was just plain blind auctions, I suffered for it. Under your proposed system I, despite having lowballed the bid in an attempt to save points, would've had something like a 40% chance of correcting that mistake and snagging away the item. That would imo be a worse case than what actually transpired, because I was significantly more motivated to spend the amount of DKP, or even more, than I valued the item because I'd be afraid of missing out on a desired item in the interest of being cheap.
---
I’ve been solo killing elite mobs in dungeons in preparation for the honor system. Nice and chill just a little grindy.
---
Ive hit 60 got my epic mount now i only log in to raid on sundays for 3-4 hours max but this pve grind is killing me i might even just stop playing til bgs drop as thats the only thing im intrested in really
---
Brembos won’t hear it from my TV
---
The added damage seen on your character screen is a glitch and does not represent true damage. I know on my warlock, the shadow type wand "appears" to gain damage from my shadow damage stat, but never shows for it in combat.
---
People like sonii digital do the same thing. How is it even fun if you’re a streamer and just feel entitled to steal all loot? Makes it no fun. I don’t support sonii now he’s trash.
---
Nor should they.
---
VANISH WOULD MAKE YOU DROP COMBAT AND TURN INVISIBLE
---
Some offer for free. Some charge 1g. I say at least cover the cost of your mats.
---
Those stories are from prior to the 1.12 client and the Druid reworks. Innervate used to be at the bottom of the Resto tree so it was part of our schtick to give the Priest healers mana back... but definitely never a Shadow Priest lol yah right.
---
I need the hunter one
---
Oh I had my suspicions but yep, /r/iamverysmart
---
Good thing it's totally up to you which raid you join then, isn't it?
---
They basically have kicked him, the “pending investigation” is code for a million things potentially, but insta-kicking him from the twitch team and then leave him on the org? Makes absolutely zero sense imho. It’s inevitable they are putting on a show to make it look like they are really “thinking” about it.
---
Nearing 60 on my holy priest but I don’t have alchemy so I was wondering for raid consumables if it’s more time efficient to just grind gold to buy them off AH or grind out the mats and pay an alchemist in guild?
---
Divine plea for paladins

Had no trouble getting strath groups myself. If you are 58.5 you can just do EPL/Winterspring or grind that out in a day.
---
Seeing this makes me want to aoe to see how badly I can burn him. This must be why I play a warlock.
---
So it never dropped but you 'did the right thing' by deciding to roll it off if it hypothetically dropped?
---
rofl
---
&gt;hilarious that people are still this loot hungry in an 15 year old game.
---
And what about the adult men who go into hysterics over streamer loot drama over pixels in a 15 year old game?
---
You got that right.
---
This already happened on my server!! What started as a small skirmish in the yeti caves ended as a multi-60 battle for tarren mill. Fucking awesome.
---
&gt; Please tell me this hypothetical is reasonable to you, that you have felt something along these lines yourself.
---
Afraid not, I don't drink soda.
---
&gt;The guy drinking the can of Dr Pepper effectively influenced your decision on which soda to buy. Maybe he himself really did prefer Dr Pepper to any other soda, and that's why he bought it. Maybe he works for Dr Pepper and he has a weird contract that stipulates he can only drink Dr Pepper in public. Maybe he was influenced by someone else. You see where I'm going with this, hopefully.
---
I see where you're coming from sure, and I'm sure these people exist, but I've never really felt the thing you're explaining myself. It's therefore difficult to internalise.
---
Do people watch Asmond for the memes or something? I tuned in for about an hour a while back and all he was doing was wiping and talking dumb shit while begging for money in-game. Oh and talking about manipulating the AH, which I had a 7 day suspension for doing.. But it's okay when he does it, apparently because he has an audience or something.
---
FML
---
What are you smoking, 10-12 hours lmao.  When my full group was 55 while leveling we ran a full run in 3 hours, you must be running to bosses in a veeeery strange order for it to take longer than 4 hours if you are underleveled/undergeared or everyone in the group just right clicks a mob and goes afk.
---
No, it doesn't. Unless you are a trained psychologist, you can't just say someone is a sociopath based on some videos.
---
Your weapons both look like fish.
---
it did this back in vanilla too, so its not modern tech to blame.
---
In your chat tab setting, the option Channel is ticked by default. Untick it and you won't get the notifications. I think it's under Other (the third option once the menu opens). At work atm so can't check but browse around and you'll find it.
---
&gt; Again though I'm not really sure what we're arguing about because I'm not sure what your central point is. Perhaps it has been too long since I visited the thread.
---
Lol yeah, that's what I meant with my first line. I was originally just trying to argue that slow leveler = bad player isn't true, but you seem to have been in a different headspace when you replied and most of it was regarding effort = reward in the game.
---
I think we best just leave here :)
---
Gotcha
---
No bait. (Puns maybe) I've seen the same names there FOR WEEKS. Any time I swing by there. Day or night. The same names swimming in the same loop.  Even better are the bots who have their pathing messed up and drown over and over

As a player on the alliance side of a unbalanced server “horde dominant” I can only imagine the ganking that will begin.
---
I got to 57 as a pally.
---
Method doesn't even have most of their main roster players playing Classic because they obviously don't give a shit about old content(they even haphazardly play Classic). Classic mechanically compared to Retail is a fucking joke. Being good at Classic is nothing special, sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Classic has more players than Vanilla did? Doubt...
---
Yes it is.  But you wouldn't know that from the flood of people complaining about what streamers are doing when people in the raid know what's going to happen.
---
Always been suspicious of that guy. I loved the fact that he obviously didn't stream any of his XP abuse when racing to world first 60, too. He comes across as a typical sociopath to me.
---
Gained a lot more respect for Method, too.
---
Not rly true. All top speed clears are done with 10 healers. Burning trash while also fighting bosses and having 1 tank means you need to not run out of mana and you need more healers for that. Less healers means you stop completly for mana.
---
This is hilarious.. gg jokerd
---
What do you mean throwing his career away ? He's still on twitch, he can still play WoW. He's just not getting the Method money, that's all.
---
Wasn't this guy game first 60?  That's where I heard about him, thought he was going to delete his character.
---
you prob got denied due to your stupid ticket behavior, next time think twice before threatening like \`omg omg i will not play\`

i am super serious

He did nothing ban worthy lol.
---
sadly no one will see it because #healerlife
---
God bless you bonethugZ
---
Did he really think Method would let him get away with that? lmao
---
&gt;or grind out the mats and pay an alchemist in guild?
---
In my experience most guildies don't charge for crafting potions, so this would be the cheapest option unless the market on your server is really messed up.
---
If a dude scams you in real life and the police can't do anything do you give up and shoot yourself?
---
You move on, most people aren't scammers.
---
In WoW there's a community too, you tell your guild, you can tell the scammers guild, you can post it on your realm discord/reddit, you can mention it in trade chat. 
---
Some people will listen ignore list the guy.
---
Or maybe they are putting on a show, then unsuspend him after it all blows over, which it will, in about 2 days lol
---
The best part is that you deflected and never answered.  I bet you would blame the victim every time.
---
If it lends any credibility to what I'm saying, I have a master's in economics with a focus on microeconomics and market interactions. I know this stuff.

ITS JUST A GAME OMEGIELULIES 😡
---
I’ve never heard of these people but dude was a total douche bag!
---
I noticed on Faerlina there are so many people in Org that it won’t render everything. Like I’ll take two steps forward and 40-50 more people render. I think the screenshot is misleading.
---
I'm curious how he knows the timing. Itd be much better than relying on dbm, but I don't see anything during the Rag fight to indicate that he's about to use Wrath.
---
Imagine not being able to raid with Method anymore, and no other groups willing to take him...
---
DPS Warriors dont spend gold on crappy tank items and Bindings are bought for copious amounts of gold, ez.

You really need to not have anything happening in your life to not only care about drama, but drama that happened years ago.

---
Warriors do have some abilities classed as a spell, but i think they're just their shouts and taunt, basically just the abilities which use their voice, so counterspell would stop them being able to use fear, which could be useful after a nova so they can't fear you.
---
Nah these GMs are just lazy. Back in wrath there was PLENTY of intervention when someone master looted stuff to themselves and ignored set loot rules. Make more tickets and ask for a supervisor, this is something blizzard has done in the past, specifically with master loot.
---
Alliance
---
Yep start of classic did a run with 2x lvl 52, 1x 53, 1x 54 tank then priest healer 57-58. Took us bit over 4 hours  with 0-2 wipes. Not including Emperor as we knew we would be too low level to deal damage to him.
---
I actually just made a thread about this too. Been happening to me all day. I reinstalled which fixed it for a few hours but it just started up again
---
Yeah I tried restarting the client like I said, nothing happened. I don’t have directX I searched it and it said “install app” do that can’t be the issue either. I just keep getting stuck on the logging into game server
---
&gt; Casters Don't need the head for loot so every tank,
---
Why not? The onyxia ring is way better than what I am using, Songstone of Ironforge and a 12 int / 5 stam ring.
---
They won't look at any of that shit. If it isn't in their (Blizzard GM) game logs, it didn't happen.
---
engineering is fantastic for warrior tanks in PvE but not too useful for fury warriors. 
---
the problem with vanilla professions in my opinion is there is very, very little self-use gotten from them. it doesn't truly matter what you go with because 90% of craftable items can be used without having the profession yourself so you might as well get the items crafted from another person. the only notable self-use professions is engineering for warrior tanks / PvP players and tailoring for casters because of some BoP items and the bloodvine set later on. 
---
the only other reasons to pick professions that i can think of is for guild-use / self-convenience / moneymaking. 
---
for guild use it's always nice to try to have 1 of every profession in the guild so that you don't have to go looking outside the guild, so if you happen to have 0 blacksmiths or leatherworkers in the guild then that might be an option. 
---
a self-convince profession is something that you can always get repeated use out of for yourself, the primary example being alchemy. you will always need potions for raids and having alchemy yourself cuts out the middle man in always having to find a crafter, which is very convenient. other examples are enchanting for enchanting your own gear &amp; blacksmithing for making your own sharpening stones, but alchemy will always be king of self-convenience due to how important &amp; reuseable potions are. 
---
monkeymaking is self-explanatory, the best ones by far are the 3 gathering professions (primarily herbalism &amp; mining). you can also get some small passive income through selling cooldowns (for example transmutes for alchemy &amp; mooncloth for tailoring) but these won't get you as much as gathering professions. pretty much the only way to make substantial amounts of gold from production professions is to get lucky and be one of the first people on the server with a very rare pattern so that you can dictate the charging fee, but gathering professions will always remain the most reliable.
---
The similarities end at permanent pet and mana bar. Even some warlock spec don’t have a permanent pet.
---
If you're gonna be solo leveling mostly the best options are rogue, mage, or hunter imo. Druids are super survivable and can be fun in wpvp especially with other friendlies around, but the damage is a little weak
---
Apparently I'm the only virgin in my class
---
4 eyes, 1 leaf.

Melee scales better with world buffs so just stack them and shit on everything
---
Classic wow won’t die for a few years at least. And there will always be the hardcore dedicated classic fans playing with people filtering in and out.
---
Close. He got kicked from the twitch team.  He only got suspended from Method.
---
Oh you’re right you did mention that, I’m not too sure then since it’s typically the servers or client for myself. Give it another 30 or so, if no luck you may want to reinstall
---
Shaman is difficult to level in that range. Are you enhancement then? Try a respect to elemental for the instant shocks. I played shaman in retail (enhancement) and I am noticing a definite slow-down on my grind.
---
And finding a buddy really helps. Does your wife not like WoW? She could be that buddy.
---
Try also a quest tracker addon like Questie or there's one (I'm not sure the name) that actually suggests where you should go to level. Hopefully someone will see this comment and respond with its name (I don't use it but there are others in my guild who do). 
---
If you were looking to slowly level I wouldn't suggest addons, but it seems you want to be 60 like your buds. So that's probably the best way to go.
---
Reddit is the only reason I'm aware of it's existence :P will check it out tho
---
My game was fine I was playing and the game started acting like it would if I was gonna disconnect. So I alt-F4 because it wasn’t disconnecting. Just no NPCs were attacking me. My spells wouldn’t fully cast. And I couldn’t talk to NPCs. Which is what happens when ur ab to DC so I closed the game and trying to log back in this happened.
---
I member :(
---
What do you do with ingots / lava cores etc?
---
Killing everyone level 1-60 
---
For the horde
---
Hahahahaha haha... oh wait you’re serious.
---
Guildies should do it for free unless you are in a way to big guild.
---
Our alchemist makes us greater fire protection for 1x elemental fire, so he uses his own dreamfoil and vial. Good guy guild alchemist
---
Just because something isnt exclusive, doesn’t mean it’s equal. If 1% of one group does something, and 95% of another group does something, I think it would be reasonable to generalize the second group as being the primary perpetrators of an action yes? 
---
Numbers made up before you focus on that.
---
Suspension is lame. Ban please. Guy is a scumbag.
---
No, but you're complaining about someone else commenting in the chain. On a public forum. When you have the option to argue where no one else can see it.
---
Do people normally have to spell everything out for you like this?
---
Gold auctioned as one lump 'trash item' bid, and it goes into the pot
---
I mean that is one way to look at it. Or you could say the overcrowding is due to everyone leaving their medium to low pop servers and cramming into already full servers. If you don’t want to wait in a line then join a lower pop server. I don’t know. Am I missing something? What is the logical reasoning behind the layer hating? It just seems to me like it makes the game play smoother.
---
Id bet he is regretting the lost association with method right about now though.
---
Ninja looting is not a bannable offense... the smack talk might be tho
---
I have 2 of them, both in WSG:
---
We did a match one night after a raid and we were up 2-0 and crushing the opponents. We then decided we would all WALK across the field to cap the last flag. They tried to stop us but we did not fall. It took quite a while to get across the field, but we made it eventually.
---
And second was my guild was doing premades and we kept running into the top horde premade on the server who would crush basically anybody and everybody. We lost the match, but it was over an hour long and it was a 3-2 game. I capped both flags.
---
Good. Times.
---
Pro tip from anyone still pugging raids: if anyone, streamer or not, is leading a pug raid and happens to be part of a highly progressed guild on your server, it's because they plan on ninjaing items and didn't want to (or couldn't) do it from guildies. There's literally no other reason to pug a raid over running with guildies.
---
I think a kick from the org was unnecessary. It‘s just a game and as far as I heard ninja‘ing was part of the game and part of the risk attending a raid eventhough I never played Classic myself. I understand that you‘re annoyed by his attitude but I think Method shouldn‘t have kicked him!
---
I'm feeling like that unless I'm in a good sized group, I'm just gonna level my alt
---
How?  Wand is ranged dps.
---
Completely different situation
---
I'm already pretty used to getting camped on my 50 Druid.
---
I honestly kind of enjoy it. Most level 60s aren't good enough to even kill me. Good practise for WSG flag carrying!!
---
A know it all in my guild insisted that Blizzard changed it for Classic.
---
Lol, same way you blame a person who got ninjad for being ninjad.
---
Good job understanding why you're a dipshit.
---
Well don't call it stupid pixels if it's bannable to steal it. That kind of defeats the argument that it's bad to do.
---
Get boosted for BFD wand at lvl 19
---
Same with the voidwalkers "taunt" I'm pretty sure
---
Yeah what that priest doing in shadowform theres a Strat UD group looking for a healer RIGHT NOW
---
Walk into traffic you crazy fuck I think the world would be a lot better off without you.
---
&gt; Years in retail and I never really noticed how good this game's world looks
---
The wording really makes it look like you're shitting on retail.
---
Anyways ... I don't know why it didn't hold your attention. Maybe you mean flying mounts ? Because as I remember it, from wotlk onwards, almost all expansions forced you to run around with ground mounts in almost all the zones before you could fly, especially WoD and Legion where you couldn't fly at all for months.
---
My mind was blown when I first set foot in Suramar. Or Deepholm. And that was with or without a flying mount, tbh.
---
It entirely 100% depends on whether or not the loot rules were clearly stated in chat before the run started. If so, they will intervene. Numerous examples of this can be found. If the loot rules are not stated beforehand, there's nothing they can do.
---
It’s more that in the min/max community they talk about only bringing “i1-2 druids” to the entire raid. So in that situation they don’t get to use it. That knowledge kinda spread(also because the min-max types are the most vocal) and so it stuck as the “way things are”. 
---
Boomkin getting to use my own innervate, almost never have mana issues with minimal consumes.
---
Classic will last longer than retail wow lol
---
no it wont
---
Very cringe
---
As all multi boxers are
---
What did you pay for it?
---
EPGP is my suggestion.  It's similar to loot council in that loot has a predetermined destination and can priority to each role/class as you see fit.
---
Very similar to dkp but it is less about saving up points to purchase highly sought after items and more about making sure loot is distributed evenly amongst people of a particular row.
---
Basically EP or Earned Points (boss kills, on time bonus, donations, progression wipes, etc) are rewarded for doing stuff.  GP or Gear Points are a fixed point value rewarded everytime you get loot, based on that loot.
---
EP divided by GP will give you a priority value.  When loot drops it can automatically being given to the person with the high priority within a specific class/role or you can allow people to bid then look at the highest priority to determine who wins.  Though understand letting people hoard priority is a similar issue to DKP, anytime people are passing on direct upgrades should be examined internally though.
---
Lot of macho acting dorks in this thread. Jesus Christ guys, look at the shit you're writing.
---
It really was fucking clueless
---
Imagine being a millenial who hardcore PvPs
---
It’s also a geographic thing I think. OP is from France, I recall seeing somewhere that EU leans Alli and US leans horde, which might explain his perception of equivalence.
---
How many level 60 characters does everyone have? I got none yet. Have 6 ranging from 10 to 24.. :)
---
I'd say it's not needed if you have like all mooncloth bags, but I like having one anyways
---
I'll play hard for a few days and then take a few days off, I have a 55 pally, a 40 rogue, and a 33 druid. There really isn't such a thing as being behind. It's your game. Play at your own pace or you won't enjoy it. You enjoying it is the most important part. I find the few days of playing is just enough time before im burnt out, the few days off keeps me wanting to play.
---
The guild leader of the guy who was in the party that wasn’t in Olympus negotiated a duel between himself and Royson and won. So the 4 Olympus members lost their share of the gloves. Justice was served in my eyes.
---
I don’t get it. Is there something about those two servers that people are complaining about?
---
Cute!
---
Yeah, Warlocks are way WAY more OP than rogues.
---
ITT: angry boomers who are jealous they can't make money playing video games
---
They're not thinking it through. There are plenty of servers, but people only want to play on the popular ones. They could add 50 more servers and it would have changed nothing.
---
Everyone needs gold exactly as much as everyone else. If someone wants to equip the BOE they can buy it!
---
But I haven't actually taken any loot so am I really?
---
Sulfuras. Just sayin.
---
They don’t have a warlock :|
---
Boomers dont know the internet
---
Damn someone’s a little edgy
---
At least this phase gives us something extra to do.
---
*Laughs in pvp server*
---
At 3 hrs a day it would take exactly 48 days to get 6 days played.
---
i reject what? guess English is not your main tongue. nvm its fine
---
this comment is for the owner of that ticket obviously. if its not you why the hell you even care
---
Yeah it's kinda funny that they are making fun of him for having no life and then they voluntarily spend their time to go on twitter and tweet at Method sponsors to try to get him kicked over taking an item in a shit pug raid.  I watched the whole stream and the OP is exaggerating on a lot of this but he knew he had to if he was going to fan the flames for the witch hunt.
---
Or just coil, fear and stack dots, dots dont breack fear so you can just fearlok them to death.
---
yeah it might be if people were machines and put in 42 hours a week for fsrming zf.
---
except nobody does this shit.
---
and there are far better farms out there. do those farms destroy the economy too?
---
again, crying just for the sake of crying.
---
Oh, no rogues have done this, they are dumb af then.
---
Comments don't go in time order you fucking moron
---
personal loot is a garnage system
---
Damn people are really upset about this huh?
---
He is just providing a true classic experience.
---
Perception is a hell of a thing because a lot of that exonerates him, and after watching the vod I feel less inclined to want to flame him. He was leading a raid, he’s entitled to distribute loot which he did to other castes before he took a NON-bis item. This is way over blown, people love drama.
---
Even better tip: in phase 1 fights are so short that most pieces of gear will offer more Mana if they have int compared to any mp5 gear. Look up high parse shadow priests, the only mp5 they have is on anathema.
---
oh fuck off
---
Apparently doing anything for your own self interest makes you a sociopath.
---
Can I xfer there? My sever is barren.
---
Ye but that's been a while.
---
Just selling leftovers now lol
---
Nowadays I never use my laptop without an external fan between it and my lap. Those processors really get chugging with today's games and the built in fans are pathetic.
---
Blizzard does not take action against 'ninja looting', or any player-caused loot distribution issues in classic wow, just as they never did during retail vanilla, either.
---
Still better than Vogon poetry.
---
Well, the warrior and pally did. We just vanished
---
Holy shit you people are out of touch.
---
looking at his videos on twitch, they only have a couple hundred views
---
You're so angry, maybe you should take a break and try a different game. Maybe retail wow?
---
sounds boring af bro
---
10 paces, pistol shot to the groin.
---
wrong. completely wrong.
---
I’m in the same boat as OP, just quit last week. I have an extremely addictive personality, I can’t half-in on something. I think he’s likely the same. If I try to cut back, I’ll always end of cheating it here and there until I’m back to way beyond a good amount of play. I really wish I could moderate it, but that’s just not how I’m wired. Have a nice day. 
---
Good luck OP!
---
I'd hate to be you. I don't know what you're struggling with in life to be redditing this hard but you're in my prayers
---
They do nothing about ninja looting in classic, everyone saying they do is delusional and thinking of a period in time during retail that they did, but blizzard never did during vanilla and they do not enforce loot rules during classic.
---
I was never that fast. In the 40s I take about 6 to 8 hours to gain a level.
---
If you include BoK it gets a bit better, also, you're not equipping for MC, we're currently equipping for BWL and I think that int and stats are well suited there than a naked +dmg cloak.
---
Isn't ninja looting part of the vanilla experience that everyone wanted to bring back?
---
I know what they meant.. as it already said "sociopath".
---
But no, he isn't a sociopath. He's just an edgy fuck. You can't label someone a sociopath just because they act like an asshole. That's dumb as shit. Only people who don't actually understand what a sociopath is, do that.
---
After about 250 +Healing, lower rank Heal/Greater Heal is more efficient than higher rank in all cases assuming using the most common talent choices.
---
After about 350 +Healing, lower rank Flash Heal is more efficient than higher rank in all cases assuming using the most common talent choices.
---
Depending on how many points you put into improving Renew, it will be more efficient than Greater Heal Ranks 2, 3, and 4 after around 550 +Healing. It might be more efficient than Greater Heal Rank 1 after around 950 +Healing.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that Renew can't crit while the heals can, but I didn't bother taking that into account because crits are rare and often result in overhealing anyway.
---
Power Word: Shield is less efficient than every other spell after around 150 +Healing.
---
At very high +Healing, low rank Flash Heal can overtake Heal/Greater Heal in efficiency, but Flash Heal Rank 1 doesn't overtake Greater Heal Rank 4 until around 950 +Healing. I don't know exactly where the other Flash Heal Ranks start getting more efficient because I stopped calculating at 1000 +Healing and am too lazy to work out the math since reaching that amount of +Healing won't happen for a very long time.
---
Swiftmend? we dont do that here.
---
Indeed, that's why I know 20mp5 isn't merely enough.
---
because he has a large following.....all ninja looters are equally trash
---
Found the main tank.
---
Hey, make it 199 999 viewers, I only watch because it's interesting to see the encounters. Not because of them getting world first.
---
I ran into an old guildie from another mmo that was using the same name, and he remembered me as well. My reunion wasn't as exciting though, we just were like yooooo, added eachother, and have been silent since lol
---
For a shaman? No lol those don’t exist. I’m still waiting to sneak a soft res in for ToEP for my shaman.
---
What is doing it right? Ignoring professions?
---
If that's the case I'm not playing the game right either I guess.
---
and this is why i don't allow mages in my ubrs groups
---
This will make him more popular.
---
Breaking the 5 second rule to mindflay rank 1 spam is worse dps than wanding and using the additional mana regen to cast actual max rank spells? This is true at all gear levels in phase 1.5. (Provided that you are using at least a 40 dps wand.)
---
(Base stat priest with aforementioned 20mp5 is sufficient regen to maintain weaving, casting only max rank mind blast)
---
Yeah rationalize ninjaing shit to yourself however you want you're still a ninja.
---
That's an extremely selfish attitude not to mention your point is completely non-unique. You can make money off literally any drop BOP or BOE, but if you need on a BOP for money you're a ninja. The principle isn't any different with a BOE just the price.
---
It does increase crit chance for wand dps on Classic.
---
What's the last thing asmon ninjad??
---
We had that issue. All the guilds were waiting for the head to expire to  put out the new buff. Right before the scheduled turn-in happened, the server became instantly laggy as several hundred people spawned in one location. Then the buff went out and Orgrimmar instantly depopulated as people logged off to save their buff timer.
---
You cant compare murder/robbery to a ingame action lol.
---
Oh no! Now they will HAVE to remove him!
---
lol dope.
---
As long as you're on a balanced server. If you're not you'll have just as little to do - just now you'll be competing over alliance players like a herd of mobile Black Lotus. Black Loti? Black Lotuses?
---
Outplayed

👏👏

---
is ninja looting tos breaking behavior in WoW classic? Because it's not a reportable offense
---
Nice!
---
The big thing for classic for me is leveling and exploring.
---
As long as I've got character slots and $15 to spare, I'll keep coming back for that amazing leveling experience I crave.
---
....It’s a hyperbole in a facetious comment
---
Cool.
---
Gonna ninja loot then, no real 'punishment' besides a bad reputation. And most people will just forget in time anyway, ninja loot a BIS then log off the character for a week and play a different one.
---
Literally no reason to not ninja loot then.
---
Corehound tooth?
---
Also need more people with levelled alts, like once my alt hits 60 this is what I'll be doing one night a week
---
Looks hot
---
Like the congress of the United States considering strengthening laws to prevent sales of the game?
---
Maybe that's where I went wrong. I played it for 2 months straight and havent picked it up in the last month while i play other games in my library.
---
Not on jokers side, but literally everyone „abused“ layers even the guys who competed in method. Jokerd is a p server who makes a lot of speedruns. His Stream is on VOD 1 - 60, the only time he abused layering was at his last levels when he got 100k +  Viewers and got streamsniped. 
---
The ninjalooting he did was a dick move and he deserved to get suspended by method, but i dislike people like you who just make things up. You prob only watched his last levels and assumed he abused layering all the way to 60
---
yup
---
scatter into deathray crit x)
---
But guys, most of the playerbase isn't 60 yet! They shouldn't be adding honor this week!
---
I see people on this sub still don't understand how layering worked lol
---
Everyone 48-59: "hehe, i'm in danger."
---
Oh! So that was what the whole -" freeze or ice cream!" in Stormwind was all about.
---
Poopsockers
---
This is my absolute Classic dream, the talents part.
---
Alright bot.
---
Content will always be there, people will be gearing alts, still trying to finish sets, or are playing at your pace.
---
I'd recommend less reddit more grinding to get to 60 if you are worried about phase 2 pvp tomorrow.
---
Even with professions you should have either hit 60 or been close to hitting 60 at this point if you played 2-3 hours a day since launch.
---
Is this a custom construct by Blizz devs or something native to an engine they are using? I mean I know it’s just a shorthand conditional statement, but its a slick implementation.
---
I didn’t even manage to log until day 3 and boy did I try
---
Skyrim memes will be relevant still in 2060.
---
Took me till day 3 to get in lol
---
*You, and you, and you, and you, and you...*
---
Depends on my mood to be honest. Most of the time all. People are there for the gear. If they get butt hurt they can form there own group. No skin off my back.
---
Basicbitch pet, yawn.
---
My advice: level through dungeons. You should be able to get into SM and grind it out to 42 before switching to ZF till 52. I actually find the group environment more entertaining than lurking in the wild doing random stuff. There is some instances where questing is fun... I had a lot of fun in Darkshore in the tens and Un’goro in the early 50s there is so much to do. But there is certainly some bumps where questing just feels like a godaweful grind. Dungeons are grindy but at least you got other people there and even with breaks you generally get better XP/hour and gold per hour unless you are min-maxing your quest route to a science trying to 60 in 4 days.
---
They are both dead servers obviously /s
---
I probably would have been 60 by now if I didnt stop playing about a month ago.
---
Shaman - 
---
Stormstrike is a buff on the player, not a debuff on the mob
---
Nature added to Curse of Elements, as it was supposed to be (they admittedly just forgot)
---
Mana Tide becomes baseline (rather have water shield, but at least this is keeping with classic abilities)
---
Same thing happening to me
---
Community, 100%. I’ve added so many random people to my friends list, and we talk almost every day. I had one person who was away from the game for over a month sign back on and say he was sorry for being away, and we spent 10mins catching up.   
---
Starting tomorrow a bunch of us are going to form PvP groups and wpvp. WPvP is basically dead on retail.  
---
I’ve seen people on my server whom I’ve never befriended, but I recognize from when I was first starting. Now we’re 60. It’s really neat to see people again and again, it feels like an actual community.  Like I see the same people sometimes as my grocery store, but we’ve never interacted. But we recognize each other, and that’s cool.
---
The second clip, looks like someone has been in that room to long and is missing oxygen to his brain.
---
ohh I want to make fun of your for saying that, but I kind of know what you mean.
---
Who knows what his euro character name is
---
I’m 52, not too thrilled to get back on for a little while
---
Ah the Jokerd meme finally becoming irrelevant 😂
---
Right? How boring it must be to put zero thought into your character. Follow BiS talent list, BiS gear list, BiS pet.  You even see these dorks NAME the pet BrokenTooth. How basic. 
---
Did everyone forget the RPG part of MMORPGs?
---
Mad props to all the hunters out there with unique pets.
---
You realize that these servers are running more players than the game mechanics support right?
---
There are 4 songflower nodes that respawn every 15 minutes for the whole server lol.
---
it's just a simple conditional replacement parser for stored strings
---
And the context generalizes all of these things, which is why it's a stupid comment in the first place.
---
He'a not toxic, he just uses edgy 4chan memes.
---
[Looks like Pagel is](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community)
---
In my wrath raiding guild, one (female) shadow priest slept with three of the five officers. She had to travel thousands of miles to accomplish this, but she sure did it.
---
One of the others wouldn't go for it, so she slept with his identical twin brother (who was the healing officer in another guild on our realm).
---
All while she was living with a guy who raided with us as a resto druid and was carrying a torch for her.
---
I think it was the raid leader who ended up putting a baby in her.
---
I rarely use it honestly. As affliction I just dot and then drain tank. My voidwalker holds aggro enough. 
---
As destro using searing pain and shadow bolt Id pull agro every time. Maybe there’s no difference but I have a lot more fun affliction spec.
---
Proving my point
---
Nice Karen
---
Q.e.d.
---
I’m waiting for custom games on Reforged.
---
Yea I mained a lock back then as well. You could get em stuck but thats it. OP ran off, either due to camera movement and accident or on purpose
---
Thank you all &lt;3
---
Because it's not as popular in Europe, and I'm guessing it's not plentiful on a tiny island nation in the middle of the Mediterranean sea.
---
But there's no "numbers" on how many "private server players" have done a certain thing. It's literally just generalizing based on personal anecdotes.
---
Don't they all look so unique with their hard to get mounts!
---
&gt;Using very slow weapons doesn't give you extra damage.
---
I think he's talking about this statement. Its just untrue and it gives the wrong impression to people who read your post and don't know the math on it.
---
If only people realized how easy gold farming is in retail, I don’t have to pay for my wow sub for 3+ years. And I barely played bfa.
---
No, not everyone has ninjaed an item before. Speak for yourself and for others subhumans like you. Guessing by the "TV" in your username you are a wanna be streamer aswell? Is he your role modle?
---
yes. open enrollment for this game has been closed. blizzard will no longer accept your money
---
Yeah you're right, almost every lock/preist knows this too
---
Yeah.... when your mom's living with you, you don't have to whisper while you stream.
---
wow im blown away that this guy, who had a very good opportunity to make potentially millions streaming with sponsors gave it all up over a fkin MC T1 Staff that has a decent drop chance but is worse than mageblade.... wow, I truly feel sorry for him now. I hope he enjoys working a shit job for the rest of his days because he blew it big time!!
---
Awesome, I'd love to know, thanks buddy :D
---
You play during your work time AND free time...?
---
Do... you do anything else... other than play wow?
---
He says a lot of racist and homophobic stuff I'm surprised he hasn't been banned yet but twitch did make him a partner overnight when he hit 300k viewers.
---
I thought that was a person rping tbh. lol. I thought it would be odd if the pc made $$ signs etc.
---
What? There's a bunch of solid daggers in P1. Gutgore Ripper is great for PvP but outside of MC you have the Shanker, Keris of Zul'Serak, Heartseeker, Felstriker (rare I admit), Shadowfoot Stabber, Specter's Blade. 
---
Then you have several fast offhands with nice debuffs for PvP like Fang of the Crystal Spider or Scarlet Kris which has great stats and awesome damage for a BoE.
---
The fact that the Shanker is soloable for all rogues in their high 50's makes it the obvious choice of course but there are a ton of choices out there. If you seriously think you need Perditions to play a rogue I don't know what to tell you.
---
Anyone know the song in the first video clip?
---
Contractual obligations most likely, crossing their t's and dotting their i's. Gives Joker a chance to present his case, and if he fails to do so then makes it a slam dunk if he later comes back to complain about his treatment, legally or socially.
---
Yes it isn't in raid, but vanilla isn't a raid log simulator. 
---
There's a lot of traveling, farming, world pvping involved which makes riding skill bis over the laughably insignificant agility enchant for casters.
---
Mage is the best at AoE grinding. For ability to take on multiple mobs and elites, I'd say hunter or warlock.
---
Hardest classes to grind levels would probably be a disc or holy priest, or prot warrior.
---
The only problem u have now is looking at the worst character model. Hope it’s not too late to change your mind 😁
---
Yeah, that assholes will probably key the side of it while he's at the inn.
---
Just chill, enjoy the ride. Don’t feel obligated to level to 60 ASAP. Stop and smell the flowers or go level up ur professions, do something completely unrelated to grinding levels/questing. The truth is there is always something to grind for specially once you 60, you’ll forever feel like you’re falling behind or whatever, but tbh just enjoy the game at your own pace.
---
Couldn't they just sap you and kill your pet? Then stun you to death.
---
There was a dps caster asking in LFG for heals for a jed/rend run with briarwood reed on reserve. kek.
---
The guild and org are two separate things. I believe Josh is out of the org but on the raid team in the guild.
---
pve healer: troll
---
pvp healer: undead, though troll isn't far behind
---
pve shadow: irrelevant
---
pvp shadow: troll
---
trispec: troll
---
if you don't want your super expensive DoT/HoT dispelled accidentally by paladins: troll
---
Tell us what you really feel
---
In vanilla when it was my turn for a leaf, we went 12 weeks before seeing one. My luck.
---
Recommend a warr tank 56 minimum. Emperor hits so fing hard man.
---
That joke stops being funny after the millionth time.
---
I suppose it kind of depends on what you are getting out of the game. I guess if you are really working toward raids etc then maybe high pop is ideal. I am level 24 though and I am just appreciating how much more significant things feel in classic. I need to go buy thread for my leather working. I gotta feed my pet. Vendors sell me things that are useful in every town I visit. A new green might mean a significant upgrade for a few levels or something I can get good silver for on AH. Maybe this will all settle down and blizz will leave the free transfers open for awhile so people can kind of disperse a little. I don’t know if that would ever naturally happen but over time maybe.
---
The reality is you would have found some other way to fuck your life up.
---
It’s payback for the alliance on sulfuras that are sitting in hearthglen dispelling Horde disguises as they try to start the In Dreams escort
---
Depends on group. I avg 20 min arena anger runs 30 min including golem lord. Full clear is tough tho. Can take 4 hrs
---
&gt;Prepare the lube.

The industrial 5 gallon drum of luuuube

Wailing Caverns 40 minutes?...

---
I mean, he did day "They think I care about reputation on an American server"
---
He really didn't take his new gig seriously.
---
who are they and what did they do?
---
I’m running Herbalism + Engineering. Engineering is just insanely good on a warrior (well anyone) but them too, to not have. Since you’re on a PvE server it’s a little devalued (because even PvE warriors take benefit from it on PvP realms to actually fend off attackers). But PvE it’s really up to you, it adds nice DPS boost and if you ever wish to tank it definitely adds a ton of value. Even if you are DPS if you want stuff like your savage gladiator chain good luck getting someone else to tank dungeons for you. You are expected to tank for your own epics pretty much.  
---
There is also just few professions to take over it. You can double down on Mining + Herbalism to generate gold, but I find it too tedious to constantly pay attention too lategame. Maybe on a Hunter alt running solo Mara? I do have Alchemy but it’s on a lvl5 bank alt. I mail herbs to it and it honestly makes it nicer to manage vast quantities of herbs than trying to do them on your main.  
---
Tailoring is useless for you.  
---
Skinning is decent but you’re not a class that can solo devilsours easily until geared so your ability to make most of it is limited.  
---
Blacksmithing is kinda nice but more of a gimmick than anything. If you’re ahead of the curve or one of the few people with stuff like a Lionhelm Pattern you can make insane money with it but for most people it’s probably not the case.  
---
If I was PvE server I’d probably just roll Mining/Herbalism for most money generation. Herb/Eng for endgame content. Or Herb/Enchanting as alternate if you don’t wish to use engineering.
---
This is before WoW, i remember it in Warcraft 3.
---
Sulfuras has been said by many to be strongly balanced with still having high population sans queues. If you want west coast, look into grobbulus
---
Smells like wet dog in there
---
Lol that's why I switched. Just to shadow weave really.
---
You’re awesome!
---
??
---
Not in classic or actual vanilla. It may be a ranged weapon but its not affected by ranged dps enhancing effects. Just another feather to the "things that were wrong" private server hat.
---
It's really sad that we are in 2019 and people still don't know how to be in a guild with a female lol.
---
So what you're saying is no rogue has every beaten a shadow priest or lock out in the world?
---
Let's put it that way, Healing Parses are relatively useless. We could all burn HPS, but we'd o it into thin air as there isn't a lot of raid damage taken usually.
---
Ha! Nerds!
---
You’re wasting your own playing time to set back... a bot. That’s probably monitored by someone for 5 minutes each day.
---
I mean, on a balancedish server people are just going to flag up and fight.

You can always just not watch Twitch?
---
I don’t disagree with your sentiment but he’s using reject as a noun FYI
---
no not necessarily.  WoW was better than real life,  but unfortunately it doesn't last forever.
---
Theres not a whole lot thats better.  Not even drugs
---
I'm only influenced by bullshit.
---
This. As a heal priest, I always make sure I have the most up to date wand for my level and always wand stuff down when I’m not healing, making sure to only attack what the tank is attacking as to not draw too much threat
---
Rogues can beat warlocks. No class is untouchable with the right amount of skill and know how.
---
He did state rules while lfming " no loot res " you see it in vod before mc
---
Yes, MC is notoriously difficult. Only the TOP PLAYERS can get through that place!
---
I rolled PvP server for ganking and dealing with being ganked. That's what I enjoy
---
Ah shame, even showing the disparity between census and [IF.pro](https://IF.pro) on stonespine is great though.
---
Might as well unsub so you dont get too influenced by blizzard.
---
Can you link?
---
you still just spam frostbolt on those so yes it's still beter
---
Activate your windows please :P
---
If you are going to do this shit, why not just go shadoweaving disc and be useful?
---
Upon reading the formal statement, I'm thinking he's suspended instead of kicked for legal reasons.
---
Specifically:
---
&gt; . . . pending further investigation into the future of his contract . . .
---
To me, that reads like they're waiting for a lawyer to say "yeah, you can reasonably terminate this without losing a countersuit".
---
Play GW2.
---
But seriously, I like your idea and almost -almost- wish Blizz would copy GW2's realm v realm system with just a couple of servers just to give some added flavor to the game.
---
&gt;I can't afford to keep respeccing every week
---
Oh man you picked the wrong class lol
---
No. Idiot. 
---

The frence would play allies...
---
Worst show on tv
---
Huh? Wtf are you even saying? lol
---
So basically nothing of value was lost
---
I've played with some of the coolest people I've met on private servers. I've met some awesome people on classic recently. Today in fact.
---
I met some of my favorite people in vanilla. I've also dealt with total pieces of shit in vanilla.
---
So to point the finger at private servers, or any flavor, as being the problem is like saying forks kill people because someone killed another person with a knife.
---
They shouldn't be able to do anything without a trinket.
---
Context: 3-4 horde were camping the portal to BRD. Me and a druid were trying to run through, and for some reason they are attacking the druid and ignoring me, who goes into bear form. I start frostbolting Gnomebeater, no one tries to stop me, and he went down pretty quick.
---
Wait what?
---
Where did you hear that about scammers? AFAIK if you state the terms in chat, they'll honor the trade for you.
---
Doesn't work outside private servers
---
Wait...I dont watch his streams now.  Do I have to start, then stop, or can I just never start?  These rules are confusing.
---
If the men can't control themselves...why would you punish the innocent bystanders (women)?
---
Without trinket you should never be in control of your character to fear vs a good rogue. 
---
True min/maxers just have a druid outside the raid buffing people as they go in.
---
Shadow weaving increases it
---
someone tell me why people engage in this gold wasting activity when honor isnt even out yet
---
3x p priest is sleeper dungeon composition.  The two shadow priests were outhealing my disc priest lol.  So much so I ended up just renewing the tank and casting smite ERP.
---
TFW I realize there are 30-40 year old neckbeards that care so much over a fucking game
---
You too. Sorry your favorite streamer is a bad dude :(
---
Go donate more of your moms money,maybe? 😂
---
Agility boosts wands though
---
Buddy and I are going to start playing classic, finally, and duo level. Recommendations (other than 2 mages lul) for what class we should level as? I know Warrior and Shaman/Pally is probably best but we both mained warriors in retail. Would Shaman/Lock be viable? Any suggestions are appreciated.
---
Gotta waste their world buffs before they go into MC. 🤷
---
First time I did jailbreak for onyixa attunement took maybe 45 min to clear every pack around the cells then someone in party accepted the escort before I could talk to marshal so I got no credit for completing escort. I was ropeable had to run whole thing again with a different group.
---
You're*
---
Hmm, maybe to a degree. Still though, every guild had a forum, everyone hung out on Irc, realm forums were active. If you ninjaed from a raid, everyone knew.
---
Sounds like your client is struggling to create/overwrite your cache. 
---
Try deleting your WDB and ADB folders. You can find them here: `C:\[...]\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Cache`
---
Didn't like leveling as alliance, it was the most dreadful experience. It's been 3 days since I've switched playing 4-6hours a day and I'm already level 27 with 42g mostly from selling bronze bars and copper ores :D
---
if you post "?\[item\]" in guild chat, your auctioneer addon will whisper the auction data to that person.  
---
If 40 people in your guild have auctioneer and are online, and you do this, you will get this exact thing, 40 times.

---
just go soul link orc lock, ez
---
Haha brilliant
---
What server is this? For migration consideration purposes
---
I tanked SM Lib at 32 and I am very surprised we did not wipe. About the only thing I hit was the first maul and a few taunts, everything else whiffed him.
---
Start queue remotely before you're home to cut down/eliminate queues and wait for queues to drop.
---
I stayed on Sulfuras and waited it out. ORG + UC are packed tonight. I guess I was judging the server based on early on the weekdays. I will never do that again. Thank you everyone for ya support!
---
Not trying to defend him. But why do you care so much. You can just run the raid the next week and get the item, also wow is not an esport.
---
its the orc with the largest dick in the world, poor guy
---
&gt; shitty sharding tech
---
Nah this is from batching
---
"This guy said the guild was hype and supported his actions" 
---
Taking an item for yourself without discussing and gauging the reaction of a few of your fans is not nearly the same as actually seeing if they all agree on the decision. 
---
Of course he said the guild reacted "hype" to it.
---
Thrall + reaghar
---
Because taunt refers to any spell with the mechanics of warrior Taunt?
---
Also dwarf rogues are best rogues alliance side. Although orc stun resist can be a pain.
---
My main is level 26 and soon going into STV, should be fun...
---
You had your balls cut open, drove yourself home in standard; and are now here to dispense some sage fatherly wisdom to the next generation. That’s some man shit right there

Horde on Remulos have 2 hand of rags In different guilds so your just dead wrong

I've waited until now to level my rogue alt.
---
The best enviorment for it.
---
I don't think you understand what he's talking about. Layering tech allowed blizzard to increase the total SERVER population cap because they could essentially split the server into segments (like you said). Blizzard did this instead of having more servers at start for two big reasons: 1) It was cheaper/easier than spinning up more unique servers. 2) It would be much easier/cheaper to remove layers once everybody left after the first month.  
---
One big problem: Not that many people left. Now blizzard is still trying to remove layering, a temporary fix, when they SHOULD have just had more servers from the beginning. Blizz didn't think classic would be as popular as it is and now the players are paying for it.
---
Hunter
---
You have a pet to tank for you, Aspect of the Cheetah makes you less stressed about affording mount
---
Can solo Dire Maul Tribute runs which is very good gp/h, even though It may be challenging at first It's very rewarding
---
Lol what? This dude has been a piece of shit since day one. The problem is cringe kiddies only care about people accomplishments and not how shitty the actual person is and raise them up on a platform as if they are better than everyone else because they did something in a game faster than someone else
---
Yea man, I guess pretty much every piece of dramatic storytelling ever made has only been consumed by no lifers.
---
He means horde I'm guessing
---
Actually, dispels make your DoTs even more worth.
---
If you downrank your Corruption to Rank 1 while fighting Priests, Corruption will only cost 35 Mana for you, and the priest will always dispel it, which costs about 250 mana for him if im not correct
---
Blizzard could gift me a lvl 60 gnome with full raid bis, epic mount and id still delete it then reroll a dwarf/human. Maybe nelf.
---
If you wont roll allie then whi cares what you think about the Alliance?
---
I am Greek.
---
I got loads of money.
---
I live with my parents.
---
It rocks.
---
Well, in that vein, my instructions were to shave my balls beforehand. I'd only shaved them once before in my life, and that was more than a decade before, drunk, in a dark shower, during my freshman year of college. 
---
Side note: shaving your balls and then applying mentholated powder is... an experience. You should do it at least once.
---
But, this time around, I was stumped. I didn't want to risk applying a Mach 3 to my sack, nor did I want to use a hair removal cream. Fortunately, I was talking to a friend, the topic somehow came up, and he suggested getting a beard and nose hair trimmer. Worked like a charm. And you don't need to larger your nuts and apply razor to them. Then, bonus, you have a nose hair trimmer, which is a thing you have to start worrying about at some point. 
---
I think the one I got was around $10. Look for a pen trimmer.
---
So... you want retail. It's there waiting for you, and it's improved a lot since TBC.
---
Fuck no, layering does not belong in Classic.
---
He took a fake thing from me!
---
&gt; you are actively telling a person he cant play with his friend
---
I'd be fine with this as long as such server were available for those of us who accept it in trade for balance.
---
Meh, what ever happens happens
---
&lt;Risen&gt; held down the mountain for about 4 hours tonight. A good time was had by all. Except the Horde.
---
Did you not just see me list a bunch of daggers? Plus BWL has a great dagger from the Vael that's only slightly under Perditions for PvE and generally considered better for PvP and super early in the raid so very likely to be available. 
---
What exactly is your complaint here? There's a shitload of great daggers in the game for both PvE and PvP.. what's more is that you have had **15 years** to check this stuff. If you wanted to be top melee PvE DPS then you should have rolled a warrior. If you think what rogues have isn't good enough for PvP then you're insane.
---
“Bro relax” = “I don’t get upset about things unless they affect me directly then I act like a huge bitch”
---
same
---
What the fuck are you talking about? Classic released with 2 fucking PvP servers. Get the fuck out of here with that "there were plenty of servers" bullshit.
---
Why gold wasting? PvP deaths aren't durability loss? Do you mean grenades and stuff?

---
You sound like you work for blizzard.  
---
If you didnt get the joke, that means this is a terrrrrible idea
---
He had thousands of subs just from the world first 60, so he definitely did well. It just won't last.
---
If you wont roll Alliance then who cares what you think about the Alliance or any of their gameplay? You sound more than ignorant

---
Is this his first like real negative thing he did while hes been on classic? He may be dog shit at every other aspect but leveling.. but has he done anything else tjat could qualify as a ban from the Method Org or Twitch in anyway? It seems like people are out for blood because its juicy online drama that they dont get in the real world.. let it gooooooooo its a fucking dog shit staff that gets replaced next tier anyway.. or will possibly drop next run..    
---
This is some shit to blow up and completely piss all over him for.. HE put together the raid, HE brought a couple people to douse.. WHERE THE FUCK is your aqual?? Huh??? HE passed on several items through out the raid as stated... give him the fucking staff???????   
---
   
---
Get real people. He may be a pompous dbag on camera.. but so arent a lot of other streamers. Hes one of the top tiered classic wow streaming has in terms of leveling content that was entertaining even the second go around.   
---
Mute his stream and just watch the content. Guaranteed if there were absolutely no coms available for the video, a lot of people would understand why he took the staff in vods. But since he had coms on, live on twitch, he "jokes" around with his words since hes kind of new to the platform.    
---
Get over it.
---
Classic with layering: REEE NOCHANGES LAYERING BAD
---
Classic without layering: REEE QUEUES TOO LONG WTF BLIZZ
---
Blokes*
---
But yes :P
---
Hard to put into words. I guess Deviate is a bit more relaxed. I spend way more time there, though, so that probably has a lot to do with why I like it more.
---
Layering is horrible, for multiple reasons.
---
And the queues might aswell be a product of Phase 2 coming out, queues will die down once again
---
Fuck that.  I've been happy af with layering the entire time.  It hasn't been a problem at all.
---
You troll, bro.
---
No, u/ShamanLifer is absolutely correct. Internet usage simply wasn't as prevalent in 2004.
---
For example, [This](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183614/us-households-with-broadband-internet-access-since-2009/) shows US households with broadband access from 2000-2017. 37.5M in 2004, 110.5 in 2017. That's almost 3x higher. 
---
Or [this](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/) showing, among other things, an increase from 68% in 2005 to 90% in 2019 of adults that even USE the internet, but contrast to 29% up to 73% of adults that use home broadband over that same period. This means that in 2005, 32% of the adult population in the US didn't even USE internet, and 71% weren't using it at home through any type of broadband connection.
---
And yes, there were non-broadband ways of getting on the internet, but you simply were not spending the same amount of time online through a dial up. 
---
There is so much more data out there, it all supports the same thing.  And I'm betting non-US data will show the same as well.
---
It's a lose lose, they keep layers and people get pissed that the layers didn't get removed.
---
They remove them and people are pissed that there are que times.
---
Yes, they are better. No more layering to exploit mobs or run from PvP. You're playing a popular game on a popular server, if you don't want queues change servers.
---
JUSTICE IS SERVED!   
---
Now it just needs to be forever.
---
cringes.
---
A quarter of your races moo
---
Well Twisted Leagues is out tonight and I can't make up my mind what grind I should dedicate to.
---
&gt; It also affects Alliance players who believe they have a disadvantage in PvP and should avoid PvP servers.
---
Some of the PVP servers that i avoided because of this ended up 80%+ in favor of horde. It was ultimately a good move, can't control what everybody else does and rerolling your whole roster onto a new server isn't fun.
---
  I think that depends on if loot rules were established. If so im fairly certain he can get at least a temp ban.
---
Have fun paying your rent moron
---
Nah your just another piece of shit with no morals, probably a cringy little zoomer.
---
No way did this really happen.
---
Do MC bosses resist fire like the Fiery enchant? Debating whether I should enchant Fiery or Crusader on my 2H
---
ok boomer
---
This is wrong, gnomeregan should say 4h - 24h
---
i wish i was trolling.  i had a lot of smart friends who fell off the wagon because of WoW.  Even my brother who was top of his high school class ended up addicted and dropped out of college
---
Who?
---
How else will baby learn to use more dots and kill the fucking whelps?
---
You just called someone a sub human because he ninjad loot in a video game lol chill
---
Or that it's real easy to do anything without challenge, grats on easy work
---
FontDamageChanger addon lets you use whatever font you want. just drop the font file in the folder and rename it
---
You can sub with game time cards
---
Nah that's a good deal for a frame that size
---
Yes, most resist fire.
---
Daggers are better for pvp, and they are much more fun to play! Swords are for lazy pvers
---
I think he's being stalked down by a horse. They're kinda scary, ya know. Much faster than a tauren.
---
How does a PvE server determine who gets the world boss? Is it just a server-wide game of tag first? Pretty lame if so.
---
Can some of you please come to anathema my server sucks
---
Before this patch, I don't feel that happened all that often. I do know I'll be jumping in fights I don't belong for free honor come tomorrow.
---
dumb question, is there some kind of lock on how many times you can turn in onyxias head and get the buff? surely with all the raid groups on high pop servers theres someone handing in her head every hour... why is handing her head in such a huge event? (i understand the buff, i dont understand the limit?)
---
I think you still take the durability loss for getting hit, just not the 10% for dying. I think.
---
Looking at this subreddit everyday... isnt that every pvp server? Haha
---
Gotta stack the whole group and they won’t charge. Hilarious how that worked in the last room
---
Rogues, Warlocks, and Shadow Priest require zero skill. EZ mode specs
---
There was also that huge wave of layoffs early this year, IIRC.
---
That almost exclusively hit HR and customer support IIRC.
---
Hahaha this is funny
---
&gt; Which is what the downvote upvote system is for, if enough people’s personal anecdotes resonate with a post it goes up, if it doesn’t?
---
People agreeing with an anecdote =/= multiple instances of that anecdote.
---
Generalizing based off of an anecdote is still bad.
---
Stop trying to defend stereotyping and generalizing.
---
The looking for group channel was never separated
---
Imagine completely destroying your reputation for a piece of MC loot
---
I just like the fantasy of it. I used to not, but now I appreciate it a bit more. I also enjoy being a very humble and kind gnome since the general conclusion is that they're all shitheads. Feels like I make a difference in my server.
---
You're the majority. Don't give too much credence to the very vocal minority

Yep. The unfortunate thing about the internet going mainstream is that it’s been flooded with idiots.

That’s call conspiracy to kidnap

---
I know, but you can see more people outside of dungeons and whisper, ask if they need anyone. I find sometimes with the LFG channel you can get overlooked pretty quickly unless you’re running a very popular dungeon. On my server it still took almost 2 hours during peak times to find a group for Blackfathom Deeps.
---
Life without a child is immensely easier though. They're a massive financial burden with terrible ROI and the emotional burden absolutely eclipses that. Temper snapped after being asked "but why?" for the 700th time in a row? Welp, that's an emotional scar for life. Wanted to facefuck your wife but forgot to lock the door? Enjoy raising a fucked up pervert. Your $100 for a few years is nothing in comparison, and thousands of hours is still less than literally the rest of your fuckin life being responsible for another person who, statistically, is way more likely to be somehow fucked up than hitting the elusive target of "somewhat normal".
---
Me too
---
I wasn’t too keen on the idea of layering to begin with, but now I’ve experienced before and after, I do prefer the layers from a gameplay experience standpoint. 
---
I tried to get into BRD today and couldn’t zone in because of the insane lag.
---
However, giving a timestamp of the event is huge because they can filter their logs to find the event you're talking about. But yes, due to photoshopping and other editing techniques they do not accept screenshot proof
---
Payment for thme pvp god.
---
No changes should die in a fire.
---
Ok boo

How binary!
---
Give something to shadow priest to enable kittle more mana sustainability
---
The one on the right has too much skin.
---
Maybe he sticks entire zones in his socket, if you know what I mean
---
I like seeing crowded cities. Gives a kind of visual "fuck you" to the whole "you think you di, but you don't" attitude.
---
I would vote for shaman for slower gameplay being effective. Totems are long term buffs so you don't have to cast them often, healing is 1 buttonish, dps while leveling is 2-3 buttonish. You're always welcome in groups, questing is somewhat slow but rather easy, healing is the preferred group role for shaman, and you get to run fast starting at 20.
---
Good luck in azeroth!
---
that sounds like something they cant do instantaneously upon creating a character, and globally to all players
---
Me *am* that kind of orc
---
We can jump boss run with 3: priest, shaman and mage.
---
Haha get shit on
---
P2 won't impact the price of these gloves at all. They are pve gloves. There are limited replacements for the long foreseeable future. They hold their relative value. The price will go up however what you can purchase with that gold will not. 
---
At the moment they are worth 5 oranges and each orange costs 10g. In the future they will be worth 5 oranges and each orange costs 20g. You will get a higher price but the same buying power.
---
This is an amazing move by Jokerd lol. Some people take it too seriously.

Only hordefags say that

And you a nerd with your sports stats and fantasy football LOL

Try again but escalate it, ask the CS on the phone if you can get a support agent that is able to help with a really awkward account restoration from years ago. Be patient and be nice and *usually* it's pretty clean. Blizz CS can do some insane account restorations, but sometimes you get a bad CS person
---
Hi everyone! Ex heroin addict checkin in. WoW, especially classic WoW can feel very similar sometimes. Luckily it’s not as expensive :p
---
Thanks mate.  This gave me good chuckle right before bed.
---
Wise words.
---
It sure is 15 years old game. But classic is classic, it is 2,5 month old. When everyone has a fresh start it becomes a new race to become the best geared, and it brings all the shady shit like this to the race.
---
Is there a tab somewhere to show world PvP stats now that honor is a thing?
---
It's called a ternary statement. Most programming languages have some version of it.
---
? Right now I do around 1000dps aoe dmg. This thing will increase my aoe dmg by quite much.
---
Vs single target it is obvious bad
---
Blizz has not done shit about bots until mid legion
---
It's going to be both.  Every time an raid gets rolled for an hour straight, they spirit rez, hearth out, and take their frustrations out in hillsbrad.
---
Good post :D You're the kind of person that don't get invited to parties (not in-game, but in general). Ever wonder why that is? :D
---
Says the ninja looter
---
Good I hope they stand by it. I won’t support Method if they let him stay. He’s not a good human, something is wrong with him.
---
The struggle is real, that's for sure. Our guild is struggling because there's just no one to recruit. We are hovering at around 15 to 20 members at level 60 nightly, but that's not enough for MC.
---
We've debated merging with other guilds, but most aren't interested in losing their guild tags, officer statuses, and assignments. We don't really blame then either; we don't want to go back to "Grunt" rank ourselves.
---
Next few months are going to determine the long term status of our guild.
---
6 hour cool down to get the buff.

Black lotus farming is so competitive it’s not uncommon to have multiple people trying to pick the same lotus at the same time. Within seconds any lotus is gone. It’ll be 4-5 hours after server reset and the lotus spawn timer is only up a couple minutes. 
---
You spend more time getting less, but it’s worth more, so it kind of balances out. I don’t think there’s a happy medium for server pop. More farmers means niche items are more readily available, less farmers means better farming yourself. 
---
Personally, I go with high pop for the pool of players to fill rosters.
---
Oof
---
Feel like pure shit. Just want Bonethugz back.
---
Yeah that's the one I was leaning towards too.
---
Fucking gold dawg
---
Check the deposit. It is probably very little of none, so there is no issue with trying to charge a higher amount. If is probably unlikely someone would buy it for too high, though.
---
Ha!
---
He's right. Race literally doesn't matter unless you're at the highest level where every point of damage counts. Enjoy being a troll.
---
BWL is 4-6 months away, plus the time it takes for your average raider to see it drop &amp; actually win it.
---
You use retaliation on a Garr 8 ball. It gets you snap aggro + the parrying keeps you from dying in the first couple seconds of the fight while everyone is getting setup.
---
Incendius yuppp
---
Not giving a shit  stop overreacting
---
LOL, rng not on your side that day
---
Indeed. There are plenty of times I don't go for people because the odds aren't in my favor.
---
But when that warrior pulls three mobs and dips below 50%.... 
---
Now you got a stew cookin, baby
---
Maybe add proof a vid clip or screenshots just saying that you were wronged never holds up.
---
One of my guild mates was in a pug where a binding was ninja'd.  Blizzard did nothing despite most of the raid reporting the guy.  Apparently loot rules are only official if stated in raid chat.  Any other chat doesn't count.
---
I really hate that FFA now means that nothing is locked. Because that's not what free for all is.
---
Sounds good. Three replies says it all lol.
---
Yesterday night I had no problems, but I’m on a PvE Oceanic server. I think my yesterday night is likely your morning, depending on where you’re from.
---
Legit same
---
Balanced.  As all things should be.
---
I thought that was %g, like how if you target someone and say %T it says their name.
---
While leveling in wetlands as a priest with my friend as a hunter. ?? Shaman jumped my friend, so I just kept dispelling frost shock and healing him. We ended up killing him and we still talk about it 15 years later. 
---
Bonus: after TBC came out we did an arena and went up against the famous warrior Pat (from Pat pvp) and we killed him. I think my friend might still have the screenshot.
---
This post breaks so many rules it's a surprise it's still up.
---
No, I don't. During Vanilla people were ALL OVER YouTube, and before that forums and P2P programs.
---
Inaccurate. 
---
Someone ninja-Ed my group during SM Armoury. Got the fuckers suspended and had their items removed.

Took plenty of screenshots and it worked.

.. I swear to god Reddit some days. Yes sp is prio, I'm saying that for CERTAIN BOSS FIGHTS running pieces that are only frost sp isn't BIS and you'd be better off swapping a piece for example.      
---
Also it's not running int for purely the purposes of mana, it's just that int is better for aoe.
---
Yeah it's silly. If you bid on everything you will end up doing far more damage than the person who hangs out for a weapon that might never drop. 
---
In vanilla I saw one Perditions (which I won thankfully), zero mage blades. Friends raid never saw the dredger. I never saw CHT. And so on.
---
I made sure to keep a good enough stockpile of DKP to win Perditions (that I got last night woo!) but I was already 6/8 T1 and the only reason I wasn't 8/8 was that me and the other rogues have been pretty good about sharing upgrades. For example CHT dropped last night as well and I left it for the new rogue as I had Gutgore and Distracting already so it was way better for him.
---
But what they're doing is really silly.
---
Honestly most people I see Overhealing a lot are not with Greater Heal. Few use that and when it's used it's usually because it's needed. It's HoTs - Priests and Druids - which are normal culprits but can often be used better. People use them to top people off instead of just a small direct heal, so they have a lot of avoidable overhealing. Or sometimes people overheal a lot on tanks because they'll just spam even when the tank doesn't need it instead of at the very least cancel casting. But what's also a problem is when all the healers don't have Healcomm, so you don't know a person is being healed until it goes through, and that screws over everybody.
---
I have a 60 on incendius and faerlina. Faerlina is grand and exciting,  always full, but it has no soul. If that makes any sense.  Incendius *feels* classic and it's very well balanced.  Check our discord too.
---
this is why women arent allowed in the best guilds
---
Riding speed is only 1%, so it's pretty insignificant as well.
---
My cat is 1.2% attack speed and with Frenzy it's even better. I don't think I've ever lost against a caster.
---
As one guy tweeted, “guy just speed ran his career” lmao.
---
He lives in Malta, rent is super expensive.
---
And horde across the board is fucked. Alliance Will have instant queues, and horde anywhere from 10-25 minutes. Likely 15+. All the massive PvP servers aside from like 1-2 of them depending on region are all horde dominated with 65-90% horde.
---
this post was made by the "No friends" gang
---
EPL 100%
---
Yeah, fuck Vanilla D3.
---
I believe you wanted to answer someone but failed in doing so.
---
Variety of methods.  There's a need/greed system where you roll dice with need taking priority.  Or raid leaders can take all the loot thenselves and then distribute it how they see fit, usually with dice rolls but sometimes pre-selecting people for specific items.
---
So in other words, dude just snatched and ran without giving the raid a chance to win the item fairly.
---
Blizzard will not do anything about ninja looters. There was a blue post confirming this.
---
The guy spends his life in his parents attic doing classic speed runs. Think about that. I feel like there is some underlying mental illness at play. Now by no means does this make anything he did right and everything that’s happened is a consequence of his actions and he will have to face that head on. I hope the kid gets some serious help. Unfortunately you can’t meme your way out of this one Jokerd.
---
Pallys are great in group PvP. Freedom, bop, sacrifice, heals, bubble, and CC. Pallies have it all.
---
its a company based on WoW. why would they not sign someone because of their "ingame " achievements?
---
"it was an event they clearly didn't care about winning." "Ofcourse they wanted to get it." Nice contradiction there bud. I was watching pretty closely as well, and I know they didn't put in much effort. My question is: Why not? Because according to you, Classic is a joke and not that much effort was required anyway.
---
I’ve seen that video *many* years ago
---
You're probably just better then them bro.
---
Yes and some people just sing and they are famous like who cares bro I have vocal chords too get a real job
---
lmao imagine playing video games for a living. Sweaty.
---
Ally or horde rattlegore?
---
Get in a BRD group and spam
---
Even the best rogue can't consistently win against a good SL lock or shadowpriest, quit your bullshit Thomas.
---
Thanks for all the constructive input guys. I am going to try really hard and listen to all the advice so i can maybe get a little bit better.
---
Eh, rogues are completely fucking useless after using Sapper in a team fight that big anyways. The only possible thing you could have maybe done is sat by the healers and if somehow a rogue got through you could protect them.
---
You need some iron then :D
---
Just grind dungeons!
---
Blood clot check too. A lot of people sit for hours and hours without getting up, stretching or taking 15 minute breaks. Don’t wanna die all of a sudden from a pulmonary embolism during a raid do you?
---
I believe you are right.
---
Layering is for streamers
---
You're at the main entrance in you're screen shot.
---
I don't see a problem with what you did. Merging was a good choice if there was a good chance that the guild would falter otherwise. If they're feeling left out you could always help them run through lower level dungeons in your free time to help them level a bit faster. That would probably help them feel like they're still part of the group. I don't see much else that you could do under the circumstances.
---
Nice to see that Blizzard has invaded reddit and are trying to make even more money off a product that they already put less than the minimal acceptable amount of effort into.
---
Except that barely even worked after they made a change to how fast you layer.
---
Gotta go fast!
---
People will forget about this stupid ass drama in a few days and he won’t lose any viewers. Change my mind
---
Nah they were just tired of having to die 5-10 times to get into UBRS or BRD
---
Did you fuck that last part up?
---
Yeah let me clarify a bit - you don't want to put just any greens on the AH, but only the ones with stats that line up with specific classes. Anything Of the Monkey you get is gold, since you can sell it to hunters, rogues, and feral druids. But there's certainly crappy greens that should be vendored.
---
Good :)
---
I dont know how useful it is for locks. But I sometimes got myself MOTW 1 hour and other such buffs before going out to aoe quest. On low levels these buffs from high level people can literally double your HP and Mana.
---
World first kick from Method!
---
Nah, massive numbers are to be expected around new phases.
---
I don’t remember the exact date, but it was the day that Stalagg and Skeram dropped to one layer. I think it might have been a few day’s before the blue post about the state of layering. Regardless, this was 3ish weeks ago. 
---
On that date, spawn timers of things like devilsaurs, black lotus, and RTV were cut in half. Devilsaur from 30min to 15min. Black lotus from 2hr to 1hr. This occurred on every server—the servers that had long since been one layer, the servers that had dropped to one layer that day, and the servers that still had multiple layers. 
---
The fact that it occurred on the day that layering was removed from many servers is the reason many tout faster spawns without layering. It probably was layering related. It’s just not 100% accurate because even servers with multiple layers saw reduced respawning times beginning on that day.
---
Same on Zandalar Tribe. It's so annyoing. While doing hour or three of BRD pickpocketing I get at least 3-6 invites. Why would people even risk their account banned? It's not like you need tons of gold if you are in the end game to begin with.
---
Maybe so, but the only solution to this is adding tokens which is an abysmal idea, as the amount of people buying gold will increase tenfold, if not more.
---
you can always make afk gold, level arcanite/mooncloth 35 alts, also support the battlefront with cheap pots and affordable enchants to fight the enemy :)
---
Sounds like the people is your issue, since you say you want to run dungeons, being 60 doesn't seem like your problem... Maybe join a different guild or find people you like to dungeon with some other way. Not sure why your pugs are painful, maybe there something you can do differently there, with communication.
---
ELLSBETH! Thanks for the mount money, you and Sif are the best!
---
Wow needs some kind of dedication.
---
As a pally. I cant stand orcs... fucking filthy greenskins resisting my 1MINUTE FUCKING COOLDOWN THAT DEFINES MY FUCKING CLASS at a 30% clip. Fuck yourselves.
---
Uh yeah they can. Skill and gear matter quite a bit in this game.
---
Is there a min bid amount? They should still be bidding 1 or 2 points.  Or if anything in case of no bids you could open up the items to a roll, just so the idiots don't end up staying in greens.
---
What addon gives that text a shadow??
---
Does Method have a history of doing that?
---
Mages can now use blink in mid air or use it to cross gaps between platforms. If only...
---
Don't die in the opening stunlock
---
You really want to go listen to a podcast called “Countdown to Classic”, specifically the episodes/segments featuring Kevin Jordan (an original game dev) because a lot of this comes up. Really good show all around, but the episodes with various wow designers are top notch.
---
See if you can convince an arena/angerforge farm group to do him. They're usually desperate for healers and it is just 4 trash pulls (and a mini boss) more if nobody asspulls.
---
hell yea i can go from paris during the 1800s to paris during the plague
---
Play ele. 
---
I'm shaman class leader in my guild. I'm willing to allow an ele but not an enh.
---
Enh. Shaman is just such absolute garbage, it is not even funny anymore. The only reason we sometimes take an enh. Shaman with us, is because we need another shaman to buff with totems. Guy got decent gear and an epic weapon. Also does about 20dps more than the tank.
---
Did Twitch ban him? I went to message his twitch account in discuss and it said “This account is no longer active.”
---
Our priest class leader was dating the warlock class leader, they been at it for years. She goes to meet up with a paladin and hunter buddy from our guild, she fucks the hunter guy. Our MC runs was kinda fucking wierd for a bit after that, then we lost our best geared lock.
---
Priest and Hunter guy is still a couple today
---
Which weapon combination for orc fury warrior?
---
Vanquisher Sword MH and Sword of Omen OH
---
Or
---
Force of the Hippogryph MH and Sword of Omen OH
---
Wanted to see what people thought. Also, is Lifeforce Dirk a decent OH? I've never used dagger before on warrior.
---
Is it? Back when I played in Legion, I had to farm herbs for quite a while to afford WoW token.
---
I also felt meh at first. Now I run 2 man DM East jump runs and sell UBRS runs with a few guildmates.
---
we dont know what his contract with method looks like. they might legally have to say theyre doing an investigation. we have no idea but its probably in methods best interest to give him the boot
---
Stuck too..Heartstriker : /
---
Warlocks got buffed!
---
It's not about the Ninja it's about his attitude. He acts like a complete arrogant child. No professional workplace would ever accept that. No question about it that method should have kicked him
---
Mostly the issue is changing the system after the fact. It becomes u fair to those who have given up items so they can save for something they really want.
---
I've actually done this with other friends when we've gone through guild mergers (or even seperated due to me being toxic and blacklisted from a number of guilds)
---
Cdew is an absolute beaut.  Shout out to the Hoagies.
---
Imagine his dad how angry he will be now 😄
---
Uh very little of it is intentional and certainly none of the jank.  They definitely wanted classes to have strengths and weaknesses but to call them well balanced is beyond insane to me.  Sure you can look at any class and say well shamans have windfury or paladins are better at aoe tanking but when you add up their pros and cons it's clear some classes are way better.  A lack of homogenization somewhat forces every class to be used but that doesn't make them balanced.  Tbc didn't have homogenization but class balance was undoubtedly better.
---
Not sure who that statue is, but speaking of statues/monuments in ashenvale, go check out Grom Hellscreams monument, pretty cool i think.

---
Half of your races need help reaching the top shelf.
---
The true sad part is that the staff is bad when compared to Magethiefs spellblade.
---
Travel in packs. Find a nice secluded hole to grind mobs in. Don't make yourself a convenient target.
---
Alternatively, be a tank. Log off in Sunken Temple and just do that for the next few levels, then do the same for BRD.
---
The second boss of bwl drops a dagger..
---
Gankers will gank regardless, I really don’t think it will make any difference, the same people that want to kill me now will kill me in phase 2, and the same people that just mind their own questing will mind their own during phase 2.
---
Your gear is all over the place.  Jack of all trades master of none.
---
I would double or triple out of combat Mana Regen
---
Their are a lot more men playing than women... not saying it's *right*. Just stating their reasoning. It's easier to replace all women in a guild, because there are less of them than to replace all men. /shrug
---
to secure the loot? maybe he went with the intention of ninjaing something from the start, something he couldnt do in an oficial run.
---
I was in that before MC you guys killed 4 of our raiders and ruined their world buffs lol!!! Cant wait till phase 2 tomorrow :)
---
As far as p1/2 raiding goes there are 50% more daggers than swords
---
Got any good hunter pvp tips? My first char this round was hunter and I never played one to 60 in vanilla.
---
Makes little difference. Guy at number one won’t spend any so they can drop it all on whatever, guys below won’t because they hope the one on top does or at least let’s them keep their position.
---
DKP is a great system but like literally ever system it can be fucked up by the people using it. The problem is this guild is one of culture, not math.
---
My guild uses DKP and we rarely DE anything unless nobody actually wants it/everyone already has it.
---
To bad if tracked him from his mama total
---
Lol I never thought of it that way but you're absolutely right. I love when I see a jam packed city in the game, makes it feel alive.
---
They do if the lock doesn't have a succubus out
---
Also First of the Month
---
That album is so good
---
Yeah, just blizzard. It's slower but very easy. I'll probably swap to FS/CoC when I get more comfortable with the spells' ranges. I'm a rouge player with zero prior WoW experience, so I'm still not very good at staying out of melee distance while hitting everything with Cone.
---
The cape is definitely from Sunwell.
---
I really hope they hadnt sent it yet.
---
Kids should find real friends, know it's hard tho
---
He's a paladin :D
---
Thanks just clarifying. It does seem like the safer way to farm. I am a warrior main and will probably be farming with this spec as well.
---
... take your upvote ffs
---
Uhhh, welcome to advertising. Being an influencer is advertising. Every kid ever is stupid at some point. You think those Reebok pumps are going to make you jump higher, dumbass? Sure as fuck do! Better hit the parents up for Christmas! These guys get paid to actively advertise a product.

hahahahhaahha who caaaarrreeesssss

ive seen this movie

what time does honor release tomorrow?

Damn, why are you guys so mean to the dude?

Level through tanking dungeons almost exclusively.

Dude was being a shithead in a video calm down. You’re acting exactly how he wants people to react to his troll.
---
How is he a toxic sociopath?
---
I am Error.
---
its a "feature"
---
of classic ;-)
---
If a lock doesn't have a pet out, get ready to get seduced by an invisible succubus.
---
I know victim blaming is bad, but thats why you should avoid toxic streamers.
---
Its not much at all, thought it was cool as hell seeing/talking to this crew while we waited for the respawn.
---
I'm sure I could go through the ToS and find something about treating other players respectfully, but it's not worth my time. This is common sense.
---
Lol well stated.
---
Thank you! :3
---
I mean, money is also just paper or metal. People give it the value. It’s no different with a game. If people value something and you selfishly horde it then you shouldn’t be all surprised Pikachu when they get mad.
---
Largest gathering of unemployed people in game*
---
That post is dated 9/14, so two months ago. Wonder how things look now.
---
aaaaaand its gone.
---
What classes are guilds on the lookout for at the moment? Maybe rolling on a lower pop server to level with a mate and I want something that is less common.
---
How?
---
Mah eyes!
---
Not a bad idea. I actually had this issue recently... saving my DKP for perditions and we got a bunch of new rogues who opted to go daggers. They got all the drops the rest of us already had super cheap and built up a sizeable DKP amount, while the amount I had to maintain to ensure I could win Perditions just went up and up as my minimum bid had to be whatever the closest rogue was plus one.
---
Of course with your system the instant they hit the cap it would come down to a roll and I couldn’t secure it at all, so there is a downside... I’m all for fairness but seeing my dagger go to a new rogue in greens and the 3 other items he got for minimum bid would be... rough. 
---
But there is no perfect system so what can you do. And Perditions dropped last night so I’m super stoked either way!
---
Did they really say this year? That is incredible
---
fuck method
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding
---
With everything going on in the world, I am really starting to believe the world ended in 2012 and this is just some weird alternate reality. At least that is an easier pill to swallow.
---
**Rounding**
---
Rounding a number means replacing it with a different number that is approximately equal to the original, but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation; for example, replacing $23.4476 with $23.45, or the fraction 312/937 with 1/3, or the expression √2 with 1.414.
---
Rounding is often done to obtain a value that is easier to report and communicate than the original. Rounding can also be important to avoid misleadingly precise reporting of a computed number, measurement or estimate; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is usually better stated as "about 123,500".
---
On the other hand, rounding of exact numbers will introduce some round-off error in the reported result.

They would just bot the characters to lvl 10 in a couple of hours. It would not slow them down in the long run.

Totem recall spell.

Somehow I don't think dumping dollar bills into a server will make it run faster. I'm no expert though.
---
Thats not the point.
---
Laughs in felhunter
---
isn't that true of every streamer before they make it big??? unless you are jack black or something
---
We had 29 bg chars and were dueling in front of booty Bay, when a whole ZG raid graveyard rezzed... We killed 4 before they even realized what was going on.

Why is this subreddit getting more upset about a streamer stealing an item in a 15 year old game than they've been about people dying in Hong Kong and Chile

I’m gonna come kill you. Horde in incendius

I've found theres always way more people farming epl than felwood. I would try felwood at a quiet server time.
---
thanks
---
If the loot rules are clearly stated in chat (we roll 1-100, highest role wins) and then somebody ninjas the item after the roles, of course will blizzard take action.
---
A lot of people, its better quality than youtube.

I was leaning towards shaman if we went horde so this is good to hear.

Death to the alliance on incendius

Hurt + your feelings

Did you put a watermark on this lmao

Not true. Any damage has a chance to break fear. If you need to bandage, it's better to let him run around with less chance of it breaking.

This argument is like saying people shouldn’t ever be upset over something if it’s legal. It’s not illegal for me to lick the dip off my tortilla chip at a super bowl party and then dip it again, but it would be pretty stupid to be surprised when other people get upset and tell me it’s a shitty thing to do.
---
Imagine logging out looking like shit then logging on looking like that
---
Maybe but only very short term. Joker is definitely among those who burn bright but goes off the rails quickly.
---
His viewership already plumeted since right after his world first, it used to be 5-10k, now he's lucky to pull over 1.5k. I've also seen him with under 1000 a few times already.
---
Dude is only funny to actual children and will very soon feel the consequences of his behavior.
---
I’d suggest deleting your account and restarting.. this is a common bug
---
Source? The above says suspended, no? So this is just wishful thinking?
---
Yeah because it’s SUPER awesome to see the new guy win every roll of the night and you roll badly seek after week after week. Or have the gear you win based on how much gold you can farm each week.
---
You have to have some form of system that allows people to get gear at a reasonably evenly distributed rate. That guy wins one thing, someone else gets the next and so on.
---
In my case it was definitely just WoW.  After quitting wow I advanced in my career drastically, got married and have been generally much more satisfied in life.  So here I am back to the game playing almost nonstop since classic released.  /wowaddictionisreal
---
Did you read the post?
---
haha its that joke that other people said but in a video game chat
---
I love the incendious love here. I play horde but it feel soooooo even.

*Womp Womp*
---
You're getting exactly what you paid for: You picked the most popular ride in the most popular amusement park, and are upset there's a line (despite every warning from Blizzard + others that this would be the ride with the absolute longest line).
---
Get in a different line. Or go to a different amusement park.
---
Garbage for you but better for me.
---
Why are you so nervous? *starts prowling in stealth 24/7* on lvl 56.
---
What bird model was it out of interest?
---
he lost sponsorship with method, that's a decent hit
---
how come after i turn in Centarion Plant Salve for whippler tubes or corrupt songflower, they dont disappear from my inventory?
---
Yes, I took the screenshot, cropped it, and added the blur and watermark.
---
Definitely had new models before aq. I think those were placeholder prelaunch
---
I bet you're the kind of person who gets pissed when tanks reserve the first orb...
---
No, rolling is the least accountable. That’s not the same as fair, at all. Rolling works best to avoid drama in guilds that can’t actually be fair and mature about loot, that’s it.
---
This
---
Give streamers cancer. Bit harsh to say such thing, glad I did.
---
i thought he was just 'suspsended pending investigation'
---
I would factor late game loot composition more than early game leveling composition. Reason being is if you wanna play with your mate all the way to 60 and get gear together, you're gonna have to do twice as many dungeons if you require the same gear.
---
The classes are not balanced at all they have strength and weakness but I remember every patch they tired to balance them a little more and always ended up fucking one class or two up and had to try to do someone for those classes which just keep repeating till TBC and beyond
---
It’s a fortnite dance
---
I’m new to the game. I mean I played a little retail with a friend but didn’t like it. 
---
So I tried a server with him, tried a couple classes, then changed server and faction... I enjoy the RP aspect even if I don’t go hard on the role play, as I have a lot of fun acting/being dramatic.
---
Now I have another alt and she’s level 34 warlock. I like it especially because I can hold my own in PvP. I haven’t been focused on professions with this character but will start so I can “chill” on something. I have a lot of time in the game but split between now like 5-6 characters max level 34 warlock, then 32 priest, 28 priest, some low 20s rogue and warrior and a few ~5s.
---
It’s also been interesting programming the add ons and fixing bugs that crop up in the LUA hehe so I do that too!
---
I have a lot of friends who's lives were at the very least put on hold because of wow.  GPAs dropped, academic probation, lack of motivation generally to advance in life, weight loss/weight gain, loss of focus on athletic goals.  Anyone who doesn't think wow is addictive and potentially destructive is delusional.  Having said that I embrace our wowclassic overlords in sucking my life away.
---
Every time I see this I just type in /general “ you got this $g priest:priestess;. !
---
xd
---
Loot council are never fair. They are always biased and will distribute loot to favorites. DKP is just shitty. Rolling is by definition fair.
---
If you dont receive a item because of a bug it does not show up.
---
I had quest rewards not being rewarded, with free bag space and customer support told me to eat shit.
---
I love how he tries to play it cool but you can easily recognize how tensed he is. What an edge lord.
---
Really glad to see method respond the way they have- honestly toxic behaviour like this is so bad for a community on the whole and almost normalises that behaviour when popular streamers do it.
---
Oh thanks lol
---
WoW is still a subscription game. If people don't like the experience then it makes sense to stop playing. Your analogy to suicide is absolutely absurd. If someone doesn't really care about the gameplay that much the prospect of dealing with a bunch of assholes with the hope of eventually finding a good community probably doesn't seem worth a subscription.
---
WoW really isn't for everyone and that's fine.
---
Oh i read your original comment as solo leveling, just join a roaming raid group it'll be way better than trying to build honor solo. If you still want to grind solo your only real option is to be a sadder and kill low levels trying to level. Look to areas that are around that 48-52 level cap.
---
No that was t2 until 1.9 patch. Your guild cleared bwl after aq.
---
I'm 54 as well. I'm scared. And a bit excited. Not looking forward to my increased corpse running time in the evenings though.
---
so basically 80% of the server was there?
---
Quid pro quo?
---
Something for something?
---
What current event are you referring to?
---
No, that is how an economy works.
---
Same kind of
---
They are not doing anything. They have said that you should just be aware who you run raids with. Only thing they have mentioned to be punishable is that if you actually change loot system (like from Group Loot to Master Loot) without warning. But if Master Looter is just being douche, it's one of those "Do not play with them anymore"
---
That's why I get up for a smoke at least every 90 minutes! Don't want them blood clots to get me!

If you get to kill a level one that would be impressive

what's more sad is the pathetic horde community you guys got on herod that wont back him up. My hordies on faerlina would come in a heartbeat just to shit on olympus

If this was a malicious act, and Blizzard has proof from the community. He should be permanently banned, and IP banned.

The game doesn't need filth like this.

I wish I was a viewer of his so I could prove you wrong... but I'm not.

Right. So Fred and Bob are two mages in a raid. Fred attends every raid each week and is on time, with all his consumables ready to go, without fail. Bob has made it to 2 raids total and never has any preparation done. 
---
4 mage items drop in the raid. Both Fred and Bob roll on them and Bob wins every single one. Fred gets nothing.
---
So. How is that "fair"? It's not. They both had an equal *chance* at the loot, but it was in no way a fair distribution in an event that requires 40 people to complete and is greatly benefited by preperation.

Well you see when flight paths are long it's something to reas

I remember doing the opening in T2 and it did not look like this. Maybe there were passed release later release serves because I definitely had my mud shoulders before opening the gates.

I think you guys really overestimate how many "kids" watch Twitch etc. See a lot of people throwing that word around, like you people cant wrap your head around the fact that there's dumbass teenagers, young adults and adult watching dumbasses like this.

While you might be low on the charts do you know if the math works out that your buff to casters is a positive vs just another caster? (Its a party only buff right?)

Kinda like a shaman with their WF and str totem. Though I suppose a resto sham could also fill that role so it isn't a huge difference vs an enhance sham.

You will kill mobs at least as fast as Affliction, or even faster. However, you will have much more downtime since you'll need to drink a lot.

You can now experience how inconsistent it is too, yay!

Puhh, its in the settings somewhere. I guess it's a sub tab thats called editor or something. There you've the option to let grid2 show the actual raid rather than what grid2 thinks is the suggested group size.

Agreed

I heard they fixed lava surgers so they now properly dash on ranged players insetad of only melee.

Seemslike it had secondary effects.

I'm horde on Pagle. Ive always played PvP servers but some IRL friends got me to play on Pagle. It's been fine. Basically warmode off

Without streaming it's much better.  Streaming attracts extrovert douchebags and an audience that likes that, so just avoid that. A nice serious- casual guild and endgame is the golden combination.

Temporary suspensions are always PR bullshit, thank you for pointing that out.

You didn't fall for the second part. I was hoping you'd take my pseudo-intellectual nonsense seriously and then go on to make some specious arguements, but you didn't understand it. Failing that, I was hoping you'd say that 'unexperienced' is a word, then I was going to point out it was an Americanism, which you are clearly not a fan of. Come on man, it's like playing tennis. Return the serve.

Seeing as you don't get it. I will be sincere for a brief moment.

We were making an observation that gDKP pugs are the norm here, not that it's a brand new concept. That is mildly interesting information, better than another meme. You are projecting your internal biases onto this. You have a problem with Tyler and Josh et al. going on TV and YouTube pretending to be fascinated by inane nonsense to manipulate people using their national pride. 
---
On OP, he is a genuinely nice guy. He is friendly and well mannered. Through the guild he created we have met some interesting and kind people. Making assumptions about people you don't know is foolhardy, childish and crass. There is nothing noble in claiming superiority, moral or otherwise, over other people. Don't be better than OP, be better than yourself.
---
Now, I'm going to make an assumption: that you are having a bad day; that you aren't usually this hostile and bitter. 
---
The obverse would mean you are a grumpy, cynical wretch. Who'd want to be like that? Try to cheer up.

No, in the history of wow from vanilla to present, ninja looting has never been a reportable or bannable offense. Full stop. Just because you feel it should be doesn't make it so. One of the nice things about the game is the living community aspect, and part of that is the community policing itself. People ninja loot? Don't group with them, blacklist them, whatever. Tired of random ninjas? Build a community of trustworthy people to work with, even a guild maybe, or organize between multiple guilds for groups where the guilds hold their members accountable.
---
This is not a TOS issue, it's a community issue. That's the way it's literally always been.

Alliance priest mage and warrior tried to gank us (spriest(me) + warlock) while farming trolls in STV. We pulled a mob and they attacked - i silenced the mage, lock feared the priest, i shielded lock then psychic screamed the warrior and mage, then shielded myself.  They all had a full compliment of dots a few seconds later while our pw:shields still held. Their priest was feared in the opposite direction to the mage and warrior.
---
I put some distance between myself and the warrior by running past my lock mate, mana burned the priest and we started nuking him down. By the time we got the priest nearly dead the others were back and started wailing on us. 
---
Warrior had a bleed on the lock, and was tunneling me. Mage was tunneling the lock. Lock got a fear off on the warrior while i got a shield on the lock. Once the shield was down he got off a void walker sac then finished off the priest, which led to the mage trying to frost nova us, and he was oom soon after that. I mind flayed the warrior coming back, and got a blackout proc. 
---
Mage was wanding me, lock finished off the troll mob, i tossed a renew on the lock and started wanding the mage before the warrior got back on me and killed me.
---
Thankfully i had a soulstone and once the warrior was halfway to the lock i popped back up, psychic screamed warrior again and topped off the lock while he started punishing the mage. Mage stopped wanding and started running but mind flay kept him in range long enough to get finished off.
---
Warrior started tunneling me again, but by that stage we had enough health, mana, fears, and slows that we coud control anything he threw at us. He was resigned to his fate and accepted the death.
---
We grinded there for a while and saw them rez and run away. We felt invincible for like the next 2 hours.
---
His twitch account is under investigation for an issue unknown to us, it’s incomparable

how are rogues getting 90%+ parses on warcraftlogs on MC / Ony raids? i bring almost every buff, get world buffs like onyxia / songflower and yet ive only been getting about 65-70%? what am i doing wrong? and im talking about ilvl parses so even though, my items aren't the best, for my ilvl, its only 65-70%.
---
I'm a married and close to 40 years old. No one fucking talks to me. You surely have a lot of anger issues.
---
I remember a DK made the mistake of attacking my holy pally in WotLK. He killed me initially since I wasn't really paying attention and chose to hang around and "camp" my body for when I rez'd. So I came back half mana and life, threw on a couple PvP items to make my life easier, then buckled down to spend the next 15 minutes duking it out to eventually kill him. 
---
Having a shield, high armor, unlimited mana to heal and "dps" with means there wasn't much I had to fear in 1v1's. Just a matter of how much time either party felt like putting into the fight.

I Just came here to say that all ya'll are a bunch of whiners.

Get over it, its a fucking zero or a one on a server somewhere. You're not going to get anything out of this post except gratification of people agreeing with you. Blizzard isn't going to do anything about it, you can't do anything about it. There is nothing that can or should be done. The guy got the item, go do the raid again and hope that you get another one to roll on. Don't play the game with this guy anymore. There is a lot more enjoyment to be had in the game than complaining that you didn't get the shiny thing.   
---
End the circle jerk.

I work, so prime time is when I can play. So not really the solution for me.

People will skip gold farmers if there are viable alternatives.  It won't fully cut it out but selling game time that can be traded has reduced gold farming by droves.
---
Fair enough, I was leaving it open the possibility that the policy changed, since I was most active from 04-end of wrath (2010?) And start of cata. I thought maybe, though it seemed unlikely, that blizz had changed that stance on retail since they've seemed to in general be more restrictive and casual-friendly as time has gone on.
---
But I suspected the policy had remained the same if for no other reason than it would be a complete shitshow and waste of massive amount of GM time to investigate every single instance of ninja looting or perceived unfair distribution of loot case.
---
Yeah, if I had to choose between a pserv player or a retail player, I'd choose pserv player every day of the week and twice on raid day.

I can’t believe you didn’t buy it. This piece is fucking incredible. Crystal clear resolution

wow what a surprise the reddit mom psychoanalyzes ppl based off internet comments lmfao
---
sorry to offend you lady, try not to send any nudes for loot!

 Gnomeregan is horribly wrong. It takes far longer than e.g.  Temple of Atal'Hakkar  (more npcs to kill, more punishing ncps to kill, and a way bigger dungeon). It is similar to BRD full.

Get rid of survival tree as a Hunter. Add the +3 hit into mark. Change arcane shot into a tripple shot, single target, that the third shot does extra dmg and/or 100% crit. So you'd have a spread shot, aimed shot, and triple single shot. Change volley to physical does and chance to crit on humanoids.

You can offer to pay a warlock there to summon you. I believe you can also swim up from Azshara to avoid dying a thousand times in the Furbolg cave.

---
1. Whatever you want, you don't need to save for a mount since you're a warlock. Buy your class skills, train your professions. 
---
2. alchemy and herbalism is good. It can make money, it's not particularly difficult or annoying to level up, and it's useful while you level.
---
3. You'll use lifetap. Try stretching your wings and fighting multiple mobs at once; throw your pet at one, DoT it up, DoT a second one, fear it, then blast it with shadowbolts/wand. Once you get that down, work on managing a 3rd mob, too.
---
4. Tell the group you're new. Hang back by the healer. Kill the skull. Don't throw your DoTs on everything; they'll prevent crowd control, and your tank probably won't be able to manage aggro on multiple mobs. Shadowbolt, shadowbolt, shadowbolt; this is probably where you'll start lifetapping.
---
I can see how that would qualify.
---
Wait, you think this was a troll? Lol found 12iq Andy over here.

This will help with the mount issue anyway:

---
if they remove the suspension and get him in i don't think that's going to be a good look.
---
Not suspending him for life could be a safe move by Method. Maybe someday he can become a Ninja of Wow classic, so no reason to burn the bridge entirely.
---
They try and find lucrative out of the way spots to avoid detection for as long as possible. Report them all ingame and move on. They'll be there for a while until Blizzard decides it's time for a ban wave.
---
You can search for Blue posts that explain their reasoning behind ban waves.
---
It's almost like the community is made up of different people with different wills and wants, and not a singular organism with only one voice.
---
Quite the opposite. PvE servers are full of adult people with jobs and families

Confirming the belief that you are also less fun

Sadly, gnomish death ray does damage to you even with bubble(both divine shield and BoP).
---
I found out the hard way after I stunned a rogue with both of us at low health and I bubbled to death ray and died while channeling it lol

Now THIS is podracing.

That's why I never fight on my rogue.

Org straight up broke for a lot of people. Getting off at the flight master took several minutes, NPCs not loading. It even took me 3 minutes to log off so i go on an alt.

Exactly this, nothing will happen. Nobody cares about some shitty staff in an pug run. People are so dramatic.

Underrated comment.

Who wants to loose a bis piece by 1 dkp?
---
Repricing is only effective if players start spending. If you are saving for bis, then its to your benefit that others spend while you save. Most dkp systems have the dkp record visible to everyone, so people track what theor competition is doing. Those saving for bis will keep their points above the competition.
---
Dkp and ep/gp systems with flat prices are the worst option. At least run a bid dkp.
---
NO KEEP HIM THERE!

I bet he made more money than you tho...

finally one of these pieces of shits gets what they deserve

Hey free honor
---
For adults, it's a question of time. Paid server transfer is what, $15? That's like 30 minutes of work for me. Why would I reroll and waste countless days getting two characters to 60 and geared up again when I can take an hour's worth of income to save literal days worth of grinding? Not logical.
---
yeah, seems like the reason I didnt use Lifetap was that I didnt use shadowbolt in the first place, it just seems to me like its channeling for so long, that I can fire 2 wand strikes and it is almost the same, maybe I was holding down my DPS that way...  
---
Thanks a lot for the reply, really appreciate it. The number one thing I like about WoW is the community.
---
SAY “INFLUENCED” AGAIN...
---
I've sent an item COD, if it doesn't get accepted, when will it return?
---
They could just as well used a different markup and then parsed it when entered in the console.
---
Fine if we're using time commitment to determine difficulty than Method is right up there with Apes by comparison. Do you not think they are equally if not more so organized and dedicated when preparing for new content or racing for a world first? This whole point of this conversation was in regards to Method being "best" organization in WoW, and in particular them being better than Apes overall (obviously not when it comes to Classic specifically)
---
Not at all if you read how the system works
---
the warlock set looks kinda decent
---
Which was named so, because it isn't a complete 8-piece set and seen as an intermediate step.
---
Also has no relation to your claim t0 was called t0.5 at any point in time.
---
Imagine ninja looting in phase 1 lol
---
Yeah we’re not standing in potato lines right now.
---
Would giving prot Paladins taunt be considered a big change? Seeing as they have a tanking tree with the usual defense/armor/threat increasing talents. I’m not even saying give them challenging shout, just 1 regular taunt so they could be viable on bosses that require a tank switch like 4horsemen.
---
Nah, just hoard dkp at the cap.
---
Which is the same reason that when people lose interest in watching WoW streams, no one is gonna give two shits about him if he tries to move on to other games. They only watch him because of the game he plays, not his personality, because he is a turd. His twitch career is a fad, and so is he.
---
Obviously not, that has nothing to do with what I said. A community is a community, ofc it's going to have different types of people. What are you on?
---
I remember Acidix! I also remember a big post he made on the official realm forum 'explaining' why he was such a giant toadstool lol
---
Bro. Time to go outside and see the sun.
---
Netherwind. Come roll a character during off-peak hours and see how long people fight to get a group going. At the same time of day, compare on a full or even high pop server and see the difference.
---
Wrong.
---
Classes like rogues and warriors have inherinetly advantage of limitless resource bar. They have no resource to worry about managing, allowing them to focus more on actual combat. 0 energy or rage in pvp means you are probably doing well, 0 mana means you messed up somewhere, didn't drink during the fight, used wrong spell ranks, etc. 
---
And please don't say you manage energy as a rogue, get real you guys spam that sinister strike button for 3 seconds before you get two ticks to actually perform a sinister strike.
---
Totems wont be destroyed with blade flurry. Same as AOE effects.
---
Make sure you have as many quests as possible for the place.
---
If the player clicks return (to not accept it), it should return quickly, like maybe 45 minutes or so. Otherwise I believe it returns automatically when the mail expires, which I think is 30 days.
---
How do you not understand? It sounds like you have at most an anecdotal and narrow view of who raids and how many are bad.  The vast majority of guilds in MC really are not downing rag pre submerge.  I am in a guild that does, and it's still easy to see it.
---
I played a Tauren Druid named Johosaphatz (from my username) for all of vanilla through Wrath, when I swapped to a shaman named Pharmaecopia. I eventually transferred  the shammy but Joho's still there, waiting to get through Pandaria... Eventually...

"Super casual" "Never wiped in MC"  K bud,if you want to blow smoke, go out and have a dart.

Depending on your wand, it might be more DPS to wand instead of shadowbolt. Divide the average damage of your shadowbolt by the cast time, and compare that to the listed DPS on your wand to be sure.

Sweet fuck that ninja

COD expires after 3 days, in which time it will be returned to you. They can reject/return the COD sooner if they like.
---
Are you the guy that likes leveling up only warriors? I think I remember your post from a few months ago
---
What strategy? You're a level 40 getting ganked by a 60 rogue. You die and suck it up. Go somewhere else if they stay there.
---
You got it?!

Nope, you can make a decent living as a partner even at a few hundred veiwers.

COD is 3 days.
---
They messed up the string replacement in several places. Like e.g. if you turn on XP messages in chat you normally see something like „Boar dies, you gain 120 experience“. But if you are not (!) rested you currently get „1s dies, you get 2d experience.“.

Hope you all had a good Questing Eve! Sad that overland travel is being deleted for Alliance players, it sure was a fun game while it lasted!
---
Some items are simply so desirable that people will go to extreme lengths to get them as soon as possible.
---
I personally only min-bid on stuff I wanted until I got my Benediction which was my p1 goal. The next raid I got like 3 pieces of t1 for 1\8th the dkp I spent on that staff.
---
But I will be using this staff until we CLEAR AQ, replaced by loot from C'Thun. I will literally use this staff for months maybe even a year depending on when these phases go live.
---
make exorcism on paladin usable on any target something like mortal strike or just give them 1 more button to press or just get their a bit nerfed beta form into the game. In last beta I played about 2 months before release in 2004 2 ret paladins could easily kill up to 10 people so they were broken as fuck with old wisdom stuff but just toned version of that would be great instead of seal of casino shit right now.
---
But sexierv when they are.. hehe
---
Youre a weird classicwow cultist.
---
If you don't have Jed it is not a Jed/Rend run. Would you go to a Jed/Rend run if they said they were only going to kill Jed then the group was gonna end? Probably not because you want items off Rend and expect to kill him in an advertised Jed/Rend run...
---
/u/PARisboring If target is undead: Still seduce on opener, but wait about 2.5 seconds so the seduce lands right when Cheap Shot is ending. They can now choose to WOTF the seduce, but you would instantly Death Coil at this point, dot him up and fear after the 5 seconds. If they choose not to WOTF the seduce, you would probably open with Shadowbolt/Soul Fire into fear -&gt; dot him up, and again as soon as he uses WOTF you Death Coil and kite/fear after. 
---
Basically if you got succ out and got death coil ready, a rogue without trinket won't beat you in a fair 1v1 - a non-UD rogue in p2 will be treated same as UD rogue in p1, but they're weaker since trinket doesn't give immunity to fear for 5 seconds, so you can pre-cast fear again.
---
It hurt to read that....cringe

Imagine not using the word imagine to begin every other sentence, you unimaginative weirdo.

Yeah, and trade, and lfg (not LookingForGroup ch.) and some ppl uses and addon (dunno the name) to look for a group so... Not everything in one place unfortunately.

Ahahah this didnt age well. Hope you enjoyed your few hours of fame while it lasted ;) beaten by Progress LOL

just make exorcism usable on any target and we are 10x better
---
Question is, why did they invite this guy in the first place? Didn't he berate and make fun of them on his journey to world first 60?
---
For starters he lives on malta so 50k is like 200k in america, 2nd streaming is a job like any other, but still better to play games (not just wow) than most jobs.

Maybe you can, and *decent* is relative and subjective. But the math simply doesn't even come close to the numbers you provided. I.e. why you're full of shit.

Here’s the thing I could never understand as someone who started with WoW, then LoL then back to WoW for classic.
---
WoW as a fucken Esports? Fucken OmegaLuL indeed. Now I’ve been playing WoW Classic and subscribe/watch Classic related videos I noticed there’s actual communities... to PvE? Like watching people do the raid? I’m sorry but that’s just hilarious because its lame and boring af. PvE is, and can never be, an Esports. World first achievements for raids is essentially just those charity twitch runs of some old Mario game from 20 years ago where they speed run it. Its not that exciting or fun and it’s novelty af because you can’t make an Esports out of it to last years. No-one is going to get excited because John the gnome Mage got a 1.8k crit on Ragnaros with his frostbolt, he didn’t fucken outplay anyone, he didn’t show skill, he’s just following instructions and spamming macros. 
---
I would’ve said if it was for WoW Arena but fucken WoW Arena is not easy to watch or spectator friendly, horribly imbalanced and worse of all asking Blizzard to balance a fucken PvP game is impossible. They had the casual PvP king in HS but that went to shit, they even had OW but that went to shit cause they’re too slow and too lazy to keep the game updated. A PvP game like OW can’t be treated like one of your shitty expansions like WoD or BFA. *You need to update it regularly*. And that’s why LoL and Dota 2 is, and still are, Esports kings.
---
Don’t think he was.
---
See my other comment. I explain what I mean by 'balanced.'
---
it's blizzard so don't expect this to get fixed ever
---
yea, i clearly remember when me and my dad were using turn undead on undead players in beta 100%.
---
Gold trade is a univiseral problem, there are people who buy them and so there are people who farm golds. And it one of the reasons why old-school MMO are falling and pay-2-win games are rising. Rather than to see the gold farmers making money, game developers would take the pay check themselves.
---
A good solution is to make stricter rules and strong enforcement, I used to be on a PS and the rules were super strict to crack down real money trade, any break of the law will get a permanent IP ban, the community was quite nice and clean. It's a waste of time to persuade people not to buy gold, so they just simply keep those people out. Howver I don't see any chance that Blizzard could take responsibility to maintain a nice in-game community. What they want is to sell more subscriptions.
---
Tbf, we did BRD on a much earlier patch, clueless, with absolute garbage talent balance and gear.
---
The second VOD - this guys a legit POS
---
And still one of the most watched streamers on Twitch and I'm sure this will only inflate the view count.
---
How stupid do you have to be to say and do that on your own live stream. He knows he did wrong just look at his face right after.
---
They should. Go winterspring to west camp and test
---
Theres no need as even 50k is speculation as is his 1k veiwer count. At peak times hes up to 3.5k. Its not really possible to accurately state the earnings.
---
Also very very unsustainable as a career.
---
He has basically no employable qualities once his stream dies.
---
It's just the way Brits are, true friendship is made by initially being an arsehole. Any recommendations near 잠실 that aren't currently bloody freezing?
---
They’re usually banned in waves but as long as the game sees success, there will always be bots.
---
people looking for group in trade channels are cancer
---
[Is this countdown accurate for both EU/NA?](https://wowclassiccountdown.com/)
---
I guess what im asking is, Is Phase 2 a Global release in 11 hours 50 minutes?
---
If you do it all including getting the key, I could see it takes around 1hr with a proper group (skipping some trash).
---
1 leaf 1 eye, raiding since third week
---
To clarify: enemy npc totems *will* be. Player ones won't (or shouldn't at least).
---
What's with streamers and being toxic? Feels like that's all I hear about. I saw the clip of Jokerd laughing about getting the Staff of Dominance over someone else, saying you'd rather power go to powerful people. Like, the fuck man you sound like a dictator
---
That’s where I am now/ what pushed me to post lol
---
Oh trust hiding in elwynn sniping lvl 1 is my shit
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA. Twitch VOD better than youtube HAHAHAHA.
---
Yeh thats why i stopped posting comments or cut down.
---
Cant take holidays? Thats why hes in the bahamas now with his new staff.
---
Flameguard gloves/onslaught/Eldritch legs/might boots/might bracers/mightor valor shoulders/LH helm
---
Ah =D well if it doesn't work there then no.... But feels buggy?
---
Those are some made up numbers if I’ve ever seen some
---
I reported something similar in the first week - still not fixed...
---
25% is nothing without an isignia. Im orc 2 and ive been stun locked with prep multiple times
---
Glad to know a maltese account frequents this board.
---
Right, was just thinking of Player Totems. Ty :)
---
Is he streaming from a prison cell?
---
Flameguard gloves/onslaught/Eldritch legs/battle chasers greaves/Battleborn armbraces/LH helm. Chest is mail and shoulder is leather. Not bad
---
quite opposite considering the amount of crying we hear coming from pvp servers :)
---
Multi shot works on ai totems
---
What kind of benefits package does twitch provide their streamers? I’ve heard the health and dental plans are top notch and the 401k match can’t be beat
---
When he first started streming i think most of twitch viewers cheered him ON to get world first, to beat all those famouse streamers. And he did. Everything he did after that was, self centered, toxic, just simply unbelivable, i stopped following him 2 months ago, altho i stopped watching even earlyer, it was unbareable. Method sellout, and now he gets lkicked, how fkin ironic. One of EU's worst, def...
---
I mean, it's not exactly like the game broadcasts the existence of this channel in any way.
---
Ypu're doing the right thing. I quit retail coz i had a kid on the way (and retail was shit). It shows you have your priorities straight. I found enough time when i quit wow, despite having a newborn, to go do a masters degree.
---
Once you have the kid she feels somewhat compelled to stay. Then you get wow.
---
Yes, it's my understanding that blizzard does not, and to my knowledge has never intervened in questions of loot distribution among players, preferring to let the community deal with this issue (for various reasons which people can disagree on!).
---
&gt;Gnomeregan (29-38) 3h45 - 5h45
---
#FTFY
---
Don't be the Warlock that life taps and expects everyone else to heal him.
---
Wtf mate? I thought blizzard was about equality n’shit
---
75% horde, feelsbadman
---
sounds like some butthurt alliance will stop playing in p2
---
Check out a board game called Dungeon and Dragons, Blizzard employee's played this game religiously prior to Diablo 1 and so fourth.  It gave them insight into making games that are for masochists like ourselves.
---
That's what I did before transferring. Discovered one of the servers was pretty much a ghost server and the other was full of life and very active. Even found a raiding guild with an open raid spot for my class/role before transferring, took about half an hour but well worth the time.
---
Bro ✊
---
I cannot stand to see his face for longer than 2 seconds, so I've never seen him do anything tbh. But he seems like the same kind of guy as Jokerd. But hey, nice guys streaming are boring I suppose?
---
Layering was removed?
---
This depends very much on your server so look it up first on AH, but on mine, blue pearl sells for more than 1g each. They can be farmed from clams in stv. There are lvl 38 elites close by but they are easily avoided and there are plenty of clams to loot. Just take with you some water breathing potions as it can get quiet deep.
---
The faction balance is pretty solid, the end game raid scene has a solid population, lots of raid pugs daily. Pretty stable ah. World pvp is off the chain right now. 
---
Tuesday’s Blackrock mountain is a server wide battle.
---
i love in Silithus there is a giant dragon skeleton that the Silithid slew as kept as a trophy and you can read the whole story on WoWpedia.
---
Imagine getting the one in a million dream of turning your pathetic NEET life into a free career and you choose a staff in a video game.
---
But I'm already on a pve server
---
Holy fuck stop crying alredy the staff is shit and its 15 year old pixels jeez
---
Blizzard could learn a thing or two from methods leadership.
---
The biggest ones are more like 40/60.
---
But PvP servers always have had a majority horde side, while PvE/RP has Alliance majority. Not really sure why.
---
40 druids picking up the same herbs = a lot of gold. That's how they can afford this.
---
im doing all those but thanks for that rupture tip for onyxia
---
That sounds tedious as fuck.
---
Hey man we can still do dungeons and find a nice cave to mob farm for xp. It's just gonna take a bit longer but we casuals got no stress to hit 60
---
They don't do anything about ninja looting if it wasn't in breach of a verbal (ingame chat) agreement about loot.    
---
So if they break their promise you can petition it. But if there is no promise, just douche behavior, they don't do a damn thing.
---
What a pathetic child.
---
Missing out on all the fun!
---
Ah yes, the good ole virgin shaming. Gotta love reddit.
---
Hate him because he is an asshole, not because he didn't do something you did.
---
Unfortunately I work 3rd shift, so I highly doubt I'll ever raid. Just farm gold and PvP. Good to hear it's a bustling place.
---
I Quit wow 3 hours ago. Bought a new car, I have an amazing girlfriend, I make a shitload of money and I'm buying a house this spring. I party every weekend, I'm never home. I'm enjoying life. Do yourselves a favor. Stop trying to make fortnite cool.
---
Method is certainly a contender. But performance is what counts. Apes got world first, Method didn't.
---
It's actually scary how many people are not only upset about ninja looting but also start to insult him personally, etc. I would not be surprised if there are some crazies out there trying to send personal hate messages/death threats to him like it always goes with reddit threads like these.
---
I just logged off and saw an interview pug forming on a Wednesday at 2:30am lol
---
IIRC, It's considered a cast in vanilla/Classic and doesn't benefit.
---
YeS! I got it on my rogue! Then I died 20 min later, kek
---
This is good news!
---
If he's really making bank he wouldn't live with his parents you'd reckon.
---
During september and early october horde were dominating but it’s 50/50 now i think
---
I mean MC and Ony are easy content. Once AQ40 and other raids come out, if you want to progress quicker it might be a good idea to innervate a healer. I'm not saying anyone should have to, but it may make things easier at that point
---
Back in Vanilla people were removed from dungeongroups and raids due to their reputation. The only people they could ninja from were their own guildies (and generally you don't last long in a guild, unless you're th GM, if you ninja from guildies)    
---
So "back then" I've seen characters get completely blacklisted due to their reputation. Having to reroll a new character and level it to 60 just to be able to play again.
---
It's a massive part if the class' flavour.
---
Maybe in the Fortnite section. But the majority of games and the entirety of the just chatting section are pretty much 18-25 year olds, as indicated by many demographic surveys.
---
By charter, fo you mean like a guild ethos? Work as a team, Dont be selfish etc
---
You cannot get higher than rank 4 after the first week
---
Kurtalos, you worthless husk!
---
Swastika is still the religious symbol in some religions
---
Succubus pet out with invisibility. You charm the rogue after he cheap shots you. Now you have options usually you run to max range and cast a shadowbolt, into a corruption or curse of agony depending on spec and fear finish dotting shadowbolt and shadowburn and the fight is usually over with your death coil on reserve and your health stone ready.
---
Lol no it's closer to 50/50. MC been dominated by Ally and horde, taking turns each night
---
My guild on ally side &lt;materia&gt; has been doing 2 separate alt Mc pugs on the weekends. It’s basically alts and people who got sat and pugs and they still clear 10/10 in a solid time
---
Herbalism and alchemy are a good option. Herbalism is one of my professions because i can make some money with it and it also allows me to get my consumable for free since i farm the herbs and give them to my Guild alchemist, the other profession i've is Engineering which allows me to use Grenades and powerful trinkets to give me an edge in PVP, your other options are Tailoring and Enchanting.
---
There are some spells that you wont be using most of the time like Enslave Demon/Banish or ever like Eye of Killrog but Life Tap isn't one of them, in raids and dungeons its going to be your best spell and the reason why every healer hates you, it's pretty good while leveling too, especially once you start draintanking, you spend less time eating and more time getting XP thanks to Life tap.
---
In Dungeons you shouldn't use DoTs unless you're fighting a boss because tanks are low and you wont find a real prot warrior until level 50+, you'll end up stealing the mobs if you dot everything so just shadowbolt like crazy whatever mob the tank is attacking.
---
How do you know?
---
They did
---
The way he behaves/talks for one? Just watch the Twitch highlight of him ninja'ing the staff - hardly comes across as a nice person
---
Considering he blew up and made money only 2 months ago and spent about 1.5 months in LA id say give it some time.
---
Or keep making weird arguments that dont really have any basis in reality like some weird cultist, OMEGALUL
---
I am happy too, now I can finally try to get my friend onboard. He said he wouldn't touch it until it's removed.
---
Sounds like you're a shit engineer.
---
Ye
---
That 74 - 112 damage staff against whirlwind axe? Dude it will drastically lower your damage. Sure you you can use staffs. I used WC last boss staff until 30, looked like an undead warlock all the way. But you need to understand warrior mechanics. Always go for the slowest, highest damage weapon for leveling. When you get your hit capped at max levels, you can switch back to DW fury or whatever you want. Just learn your class.
---
I just thought it was cringey, not trying to hate on him at all really. His stream blew up and the day after he was still has insane amounts of people watching and he was just cringe AF.
---
Rip that guy's kids.
---
Just Checked, we cleaned BWL in november so quite a lot before AQ opening in january, I'll check my folder and see If I have my druid's t2 before revamp.

When is Honor coming out exactly what time?

---
You are allowed to transfer a character from 1 account to another if the legal last name is the same on each account. 
---
So if my neighbor and I have the same last name I could pay $25 to give him my character just like a faction change would move it from server to server but instead its acc to acc.
---
It's not that much worse tbh.
---
what? the casters are literally only there for the JED of the JED/rend run. do you think the casters are there for the memes? why would they waste their time doing a dungeon when the people with them cant even bother to help them look for one of the 2 bosses needed.
---
How the hell do you turn up missing?
---
The mythic+ esport event is more like a sprint or relay race, pvp is more like a boxing match. Both are interesting to different people for different reasons.
---
Damn that’s busy.
---
Those pesky horse rogues can smell you from a distance.
---
lol he is much more tame and sane than your reddit post history
---
Only if flagged for pvp, otherwise they are blue
---
I must have missed where WoW said they were trying to be the king of esports. Golf will never be my taste nor will it ever be more popular than the nfl. Doesn’t mean people can’t find enjoyment in something you don’t. It doesn’t make them lame for enjoying something with a slower pace than what you’re into. Maybe they find the speed runs informative, maybe they won’t be raiding but enjoy watching the content and hearing the streamers. Why does it impact you so negatively?
---
The wow team is actually under fire right now because that PVE mode no one cared about brought in a higher prize pool than any of their other games, but it wasn’t handled well. Totally get why you don’t like it, but there’s definitely a reason why it’s bringing in some of the larger prize pools in competitive gaming still some 10-15 years later.
---
Pretty sure he was just trolling there, he thought it was funny and so did his whole chat. Look at the logs. Kind of how Jon Zherka or xqc play up being mean for fun. Take a look at a lot of his other streams and he's pretty down to earth, especially the RL streams.
---
i just found out that u shouldnt compare parses of other people from different raids because if they finish raids / boss fights faster, their parse # will be higher than if ur raid goes slower
---
As a casual, thank you!!
---
You're not wrong about that, but that's not what you said. You implied that a diagnosis is required to be a sociopath, which is wrong on its face.
---
He does seem to have zero signs of empathy though, so I have no qualms with someone suggesting that he *might be*.
---
Telling someone they can't accuse someone of being a sociopath if they're not literally a psychologist is... like challenging someone else on a geometric assertion of theyre not *literally* a mathematician. I don't need to be, to say 2+2=4.
---
Maybe that guy's right and maybe he's wrong, but you didn't exactly provide any sort of argument why he *is* wrong, did you? Like provide an example of showing empathy in a previous video, etc.
---
You just called him "not a psychologist", which is kinda douchey, and without merit.
---
Let me play you the song of my people.
---
garbage
---
Read my post again and try to comprehend what I said. I didn't say there was only one Horde guild with an MC clear; I said there was one Horde guild with an MC clear on warcraftlogs.
---
 I know there's guilds that don't log. I posted this because that was the lowest number of MC logs for any server. Some servers have 50+ guilds logging MC, probably over 70 guilds on those servers with an MC clear.
---
It was nice of you! :) - Hawk
---
How dare you come to a Mage thread and not mention Ziqo
---
Yeah, back in wrath. 
---
Classic is not wrath
---
I only recently found out too, when I was creating an SM group I would stand at the entrance of UC so I could spam UC General and Trisfal
---
People having different interests than you boggles the mind? Ok.
---
My warlock will never be the sultan of swing :(
---
Thanks for this Future\_Viking.  I'm sure there are many others like me that are simply infuriated with this issue.  This has been a problem for years; Very ridiculous on Blizzards end.
---
One problem with your script is obviously if you 1) Hold left click. 2) Use right click. 3) Release left click.  (Or vice/versa) then the mouse will still teleport.  My most common situation causing this is : While moving mounted, holding left click to pan the camera around me, then clicking right click to start moving in a new direction. I see that you pointed out this situation in a deleted comment. 
---
I can think of several ways to eliminate this issue, but I can't do it myself. I'm sure you could modify your script to start a loop when left or right is clicked, and to only end that loop once the "initiating mousebutton is released".
---
INCOMING PSEUDOCODE (I just scribbled this up. I'm sure a lot is wrong, but you get the idea.)  
---
\`var MouseReturnPos (0,0) //x,y coords  
---
var MouseCurrentPos  
---
var CursorLoc  
---
while {WowActiveWindow:True  
---
when LeftClickPress,  
---
if {RightClickPressedStatus:False AND WoWActiveWindow:True,   // Check if rightclick is already being held and verify wow is still active window  
---
setMouseReturnPos MouseCurrentPos,                                    // Set the X,Y position of the cursor when the click is initiated  
---
when LeftClickRelease,  
---
setCursorLoc MouseReturnPos,                                         // Set the CurrentCursorLocation to the stored ReturnPosition  
---
}  
---
return;  
---
when RightClickPress,  
---
if {LeftClickPressedStatus: False AND WoWActiveWindow:True,  // Check if leftclick is already being held and verify wow is still active window  
---
setMouseReturnPos MouseCurrentPos                                  // Set the X,Y position of the cursor when the click is initiated  
---
when RightClickRelease  
---
setCursorLoc MouseReturnPos                                       // Set the CurrentCursorLocation to the stored ReturnPosition  
---
}\`
---
Theoretically in this example, you wouldn't be able to jump into either if statement if one of the mouse keys is already being held.
---
OR you could probably also use the MousePos coords for a reset:  
---
var MouseCurrentPos (0,0)  
---
if {MouseReturnPos: (0,0) AND WoWActiveWindow:True,         // Check if MouseReturnPos is at the reset position (0,0) and verify wow is active window  
---
setMouseReturnPos MouseCurrentPos                              // Set the X,Y position of the cursor when the click is initiated  
---
when LeftClickRelease  
---
{   
---
setCursorLoc MouseReturnPos                                    // Set the CurrentCursorLocation to the stored ReturnPosition  
---
setMouseReturnPos(0,0)                                               // Reset the IF statement parameter to 0,0 (set MouseReturnPos back to 0,0)  
---
if {MouseReturnPos: (0,0) AND WoWActiveWindow:True,       // Check if MouseReturnPos is at the reset position (0,0) and verify wow is active window  
---
setMouseReturnPos MouseCurrentPos                            // Set the X,Y position of the cursor when the click is initiated  
---
setCursorLoc MouseReturnPos                                  // Set the CurrentCursorLocation to the stored ReturnPosition  
---
setMouseReturnPos(0,0)                                             // Reset the IF statement parameter to 0,0 (set MouseReturnPos back to 0,0)  
---
Theoretically in this example, once you press left or right click, it would change the MouseReturnPos to something other than (0,0), thus it wouldn't be able to jump into the second if statement when you press the right mouse click, while the left is already being held.
---
Anyways, this is still so much better than dealing with either of the other bugs. I'll be following this thread! Thanks.
---
What the fuck?
---
I thought honor in a raid group was really bad? Plus you run the risk of someone being dumb and getting a dhk
---
It's not a wipe, just bubble yourself before it lands.
---
as i said, good guilds dont invite girls :)
---
Josh is in my guild and he's a legend.
---
She treated him like shit also, I don't think he was banned for that, because she was not the first girl on his stream, and he even got in car crash with previous one. I'm sure there was something else that get him banned and not just treating some girl bad.
---
Well first off: Lok'tar O'gar!*
---
I don't think Ben Stiller's team could write this, although I'd be curious to see who would be played by Owen Wilson.
---
One of the more recent stinks has been a person who skates in the UK, who did PR for their team, and had a reputation for going hard after any scandal of any other team, in fact having recently been calling really hard for some people to get band from the sport. And then one day...unexpectedly, a press release from this person. about an incident they would not name, and that they did not remember, but which sounded like something that they would have done. And like Kevin Spacey trying to draw attention from child molestation by coming out as gay, this skater admitted in their apology that they had groped many women's breasts and asses, but they'd had a good think on their actions, and the person who reported their actions was ok with it, and so everything was ok. And PR for the skater's team had this skater's back 100%, deleting any and all comments that were not 100% in support of this skater. And in the circles that discuss such derby drama, there were bloqs that said "they said they learned their lesson and they apologized," and there were others who said "hold the fuck on: if confessing to being a serial groper is the *plea agreement* in their apology, what the hell did this skater do?!"
---
And then an oops: a comment made on the Skater's team page on the behalf of the team's PR was posted on the Skater's account. It turned out that the Skater WAS the PR team, and was the one making the posts defending the Skater, and deleting all but positive comments about that Skater. So much for being suspended.
---
There were some smaller oopsies I forget at the moment.
---
Then the big oops: the skater who reported The Skater, whom The Skater had said was cool now, everything was cool, came forward saying it was NOT cool. The incident reported was that at an after party, sporting the heady aroma of bout stank (if you've never played a sport with lots of padding that never quite gets clean, if it even gets cleaned, that mingles with the sweat of other people and their pads that also never quite get clean...just substitute any other smell that you think you might, in time, develop enough tolerance to not to vomit on contact) dropped trow and surprise rubbed their bits into an opposing player's face.
---
And then it goes on and on. Like everyone figured surely, surely by now they would no longer be part of the team, certainly not the PR team, because other local teams were refusing to play against them while The Skater was on the team. But there The Skater was, posting in a PR capacity looking for teams to substitute for other teams who refused to play for them. And then the UK champs tourney was to happen, and the UK champs had kinda heard, but thought things were cool, 'cause The Skater wasn't on The Team anymore and wasn't gonna be there. And then people pointed out the posts of The Skater recruiting for The Team, and apparently several more allegations of yet more incidents were privately conveyed to the UK Champs tourney. And it turned out there was even a jurisdictional question of whether The Team could play at the UK Champs, since the UK Champs required affiliation with the prevailing organization for UK roller derby, which The Board for The Team for The Skater, who was also on The Team's Board, had formally withdrawn from just a few months back, as it turned out, so that it would not have to fulfill its obligation to report The Skater.
---
So the UK Champs tourney was like (a paraphrase): "Wow. Uh. Ok. Thank you for letting us know. There was, uh, there was a lot we were not aware of. We have offered The Skater's Team a chance to reconsider their participation in the tourney, and they have graciously agreed to GTFO. And while we must stress that we will never, ever encourage our volunteers to put themselves in harm's way, if The Skater does show up on the premises, the Director of the tourney has personally committed themselves to being the Phillip Banks to The Skater's DJ Jazzy Jeff."
---
Suffice it to say, there was more tea this summer in UK roller derby than even the British were prepared for.
---
*I say Lok'tar O'Gar because this entire comment is completely off topic, which is actually thrilling in the sense that when this comment is removed this may be the one time the mod team here can actually say they managed to follow their own guidelines and be decent mods instead of, say, locking a thread where a bunch of people all gave personal anecdotes about the irony of all the fucked up times blizzard banned people for other peoples' hatespeech, and then without a shred of irony banning those posters denouncing hatespeech for hatespeech, which of course many leading experts and as well as people with frontal lobes agree to be very problematic. But hopefully a couple orc noises will throw them off the trail long enough for you to enjoy the read.
---
P.S. Do you think Ben Stiller could milk Baine Bloodhoof?
---
Things to invest in are Lesser magic wand and Greater magic wand - those are crafted by enchanters and often sold on the AH, and they have exceptionally good DPS (damage per second) for their level requirements. I find myself wanding a lot at 23, but comparing the DPS of your newest Shadow bolt rank to that of the wand from time to time is sensible. I am leveling as affliction, and generally DoT up the main target in dungeons and put corruption/agony on another and perhaps a 3rd mob and wand/SB until I have to reapply corruption (unless the mob is close to dying). You should however see if your tank keeps up with this or if you draw aggro - if you do, you should chill on the subsequent targets. 
---
A DPS who does a moderate amount of damage while managing threat is a lot more useful (and appreciated) than one that pushes higher DPS but pulls aggro off the tank all the time. The latter makes the life harder for tanks and healers and may inadvertently cause a wipe because of the careless playstyle.
---
so glad this dudes 15 mins of fame are over. he was irrelevant for his whole life and in three months gets partnered for an obsolete achievement in a 15 year old video game, meanwhile there are better and more ethical content creators out there for wow who bust their asses trying to get noticed. juat because you got 60 first doesnt mean youre special.

---
The farthest I’ll tap in dungeons is down to 50%-60% life unless the healer specifically tells me to tap all I want to. Has worked out pretty well so far. If the healer doesn’t have the mana to toss out a 1k heal or a hot out the warlock every couple pulls then they don’t know how to play their class.

Going to a mainstream server because of streamer fanboying and complaining about queue times. Well played.
---
He also quit university to start streaming full time and he was waiting for a new PC from Method so he could start streaming other games as his current can only handle WoW.
---
SM/DS is garbage for PvE so you'll have to respec anyway. SM/Ruin is the only spec that will work for both PVP and PVE.
---
Some items in MC are so shit that no one should be interested in them. You’d deal with this the same way you would with other loot rules. Lower the cost or shard/vendor.
---
DAoC also had a way more simplistic way of handling actions, movement etc. They offloaded all LoS checks to the clients. They had some uhhh questionable design decisions on their server side and lag was quite common...
---
Incendius is really an amazing server, my group lucked out rolling here instead of Herod. Come on over, can't wait to kill you!
---
Upvoted this so hard
---
I'm curious about people criteria for detecting bots? I spent 4-6 hours a day in the same grind spot for like two weeks and got quite a high amount of accusations and even questions like "What is your favorite color?" and "What's the name of the bot?"
---
I'm a resto shaman so my grinding is right click and wait for WF procs, it might look a bit automated? 
---
I understand for some people such mindless grind might be hard to accept people are able to do.
---
So whenever I see these claims I'm not sure how you identified they are bots or why you think they are?
---
Did you honestly enter this thread without having read the actual post or the links provided, and then proceed to accuse someone of something that was reasonably inferred from the evidence provided? Fucking calm yourself .
---
Agree, its a great podcast, especially that one you mention with Kevin Jordan.

not to mention a 5% crit loss if arms

I'm at level 51 (Alliance Druid). Are dungeons the fastest way to level to 60 now? If not what is then?
---
Just finished leveling a warrior to 60 and am currently leveling a druid for flag carrying wsg in phase 3. I don't plan on leveling every class to 60, but I do want to build my optimal character roster (a farmer, a high damage dealer, a pvper, a tank and a healer) ideally with as few 60s as possible.
---
Honestly, if you can, go 6/8 Shadowcraft and 2/2 devilsaur. That set bonus is big damage. Proc rate is insane
---
Can anyone please explain? :D
---
Ronaldo is just kicking a ball around for a living.
---
Going from rank 13 to rank 14 alone requires 3 weeks as the top earner on your faction. That's 54 weeks (over 1 year) for all 18 of those Warriors to take turns going from rank 13 to rank 14. And it assumes they have no competition from other members of their faction.
---
Good luck with that.
---
Yep. Most of the top parses are from well geared players in well geared, structured guilds who have the bosses on farm status, and they most likely cut down on the number of healers and/or use fury/prot tanks to push the kill times further. In addition to using consumables and being buffed to their teeth.
---
Can anyone remind me what "ninja-ing" actually is? What makes it that he wasn't eligible to roll for it? (Is genuine question, I don't know).
---
You have my heart. I've been itching to play D2 recently even though I have WoW Classic and have played D2 too many times to count. You're never done with these games.
---
The staff is terrible for warrior.
---
When picking a warrior weapon, don't look at "damage per second". Look at "Damage".
---
[Whirlwind Axe 102-154]  VS [Ironshod Bludgeon 74-112]
---
This is the damage used by your main abilities like Mortal Strike and Whirlwind.
---
He has a legally abiding contract of employment with an organization. They have to investigate the matter and go through his contract to terminate it. Otherwise lawsuit. It’s not just a guild anymore, Method is an e-sports organization.
---
My Husband!
---
Alliance Druid. What spec is good for both PvE and PvP?
---
Y'all are so angry over stupid item in a 15 year old video game. You should really go out from time to time.
---
I mean just to start look at his name. It’s all in the chat. He never turns, he almost follows a coordinate system. No guild. No responses to any message. You can attack and tag the things he’s killing and they’ll finish them off but then when they realize they can’t loot they move on. If you get people calling you a bot just do anything besides continuously moving on or regenerating (assuming you need to), it’s really not hard to tell a normal player from a bot.
---
I already enchanted my night slayer gloves:( also have nightslayer leggings
---
Yeah most of these are very wrong but helpful for new players.
---
I'm calm while your tone conversely isn't. He was trying to be funny, take a look at his Twitch chat as it happened. Compare him to someone insulting ransoms/pubs like Doctor Disrespect, xqc, Jon Zherka. There's a real hive mind mentality going on here and a lot of you are really hateful about it. I only assume it's because you're young.
---
i like og priest look more everyone else seems to have gotten an improvement
---
Josh have respect for method and doesn't even try to stream on other platforms after getting banned on twitch. (I don't see any other reason to not do it)
---
He also is healer in main raid and participated in last 5-6 raids.
---
You can still get the 6/8 bonus with the other pieces but you'll probably end up replacing it soon anyways it sounds like it
---
Got this macroed because I'm cool
---
You want another joke mur-ray?
---
Weapon speed doesn't affect anything feral, so it doesn't matter if it's fast.
---
You can still get the 6/8 set bonus just no devilsaur but sounds like you will end up replacing it soon anyways
---
Especially when playing hunter.
---
There are a bunch of hunter bots on my server in tanaris and ferelas. You can tell their bots because they have Chinese symbols as there pet name, and remain logged in killing shit for like 30+ hours straight. 
---
 
---
If you kill their pet, usually you will break the bot. Me and another dude went around tanaris breaking bots for like30 minutes one day. Was pretty amusing lol.
---
A lot of cringe first-time vanilla players who don't understand that ninja-looting isn't bannable so please stop saying he'll get banned. Method cares more about reputation than anything else so it isn't surprising he got kicked. Other than that nothing will come out of this. Hate to burst bubbles but any serious guild doesn't care about reputation when they have good players and can progress without needing randoms.
---
If the people in the community are saying that then that's literally the community saying something. People make up the community, who would've thought.
---
Thats interesting, I had no idea.
---
😂😂😂
---
He reminds me of Macauly Culkin tbh - pretty sure hes homeless and addicted the some shit in the streets of LA soon.
---
isn't mograine ally-heavy
---
I think he'll be remembered as world first 60 who made a bad joke. The community here is really toxic and I don't think it's representative of Twitch as a whole. Worse has been done to Joker on the behalf of twitch staff/Method than he's done to them. People here like to blow things out of proportion.
---
I think it entirely depends on how much time you spend. Playing WoW is just a hobby like anything else, you'd probably have poor social skills if you lock yourself in your garage trying to make the perfect pottery vase as well.
---
Genius. If only they were Horde, I’m gonna have to get some ally enemy guilds here (we’re friends with a few horde guilds)
---
All.The.Time. #justhunterthings
---
Mograine is balanced
---
I've seen one in wintersping by the owlbeast cave in the east side on Bloodsail. Still running around doing the same shit. Even had it do my killing for me.
---
Do you even know what an isp is
---
"for1 5 years" nah, that's a lie. For the majority of WoW's life, scammers have gotten punished.
---
It's not "bad" to people who care about being more than a glass cannon. Mageblade + Grimoire has more total stamina but still provides fewer intellect than Staff of Dominance.
---
As another guy stated you get free mount at 40. So only thing I’d recommend buying while leveling is maybe a big soul bag and 3 runecloth bags, aswell as grimoires and skills. 
---
Should also save a bit of money for your epic mount. It doesn’t cost 900g, but it’s still not cheap for the items you have to buy in/prior to the quest. (Around 500g depending on prices)
---
That's a pretty funny joke post +1
---
&gt; ~~Warlocks BiS gear~~ *the random online guide I read and use instead of thinking* uses 0pc of T1 for raiding.

That is a beautiful set of mountains

Lmao justice feels good
---
I mean, Preach's Drama time videos have covered countless incidents like these. I don't watch those videos anymore, some of the stories are fucking immensely depressing.
---
I used to play on a private server that first implemented this progressive patch system.
---
The private server I played on became hell on earth when honor released.
---
I will stop playing Classic completely except 1 day per week when I will be doing raiding until they release BG's.
---
Mages, able to blink successfully when going over an obstacle
---
Yes true, but when would a community as a whole want something 100% together?
---
Complaining that thousands of people have different wants is, for me, confusing. And it is kinda of a moot point. (Think that's the right word for it)
---
Didn't mean to come off as hostile towards you btw.
---
Some other people (not me) may wonder why you even play classic when there is a lot of improvement to be made in real life. Instead you sit in front of the computer for unhealthy amount of time and spending your youth leveling your virtual characters.
---
You guys know of any addon that can add 2 additional action bars on my screen? Wanna have 2 buttons for consumables
---
where my druids of the flame at
---
Now people read one guide with green trash and think 1800 max HP and mana are good for raiding just because their Shadow Bolts crit for 100 more. Until they get oneshot by weak AoE ten seconds later.
---
No, no you would be surprised how common it is.
---
How much of a difference is there in dps between 2H fury warrior and dual wield fury warrior?
---
All good points. Thanks for that. Still, it would never be worth much at vendor, maybe 2g?
---
ok
---
Hahaha, bless you!
---
No arguments, no discussion. Cya fanboy

I think a friend of mine was in your guild. TBH though, I can see things like this happening often.

You need to buy some gold mate, maybe there is a website for it
---
You think MCC is going to end up homeless and an addict? Or Jokerd? 
---
MCC is sober AFAIK, he's the CEO of a podcasting company, is still acting in small roles, and has been with the same girl over two years now.
---
What's speed got to do with it?
---
I'm curious: really scammers pay 13€ a month to spam gold selling websites in channels?
---
Feral.
---
Depending on your play style you can look into Omen of Clearity from the Balance tree or put some points into restoration to be a more reliant healer. Especially the tier 2 talent which reduces cast interrupts from getting hit by 70% can be damn useful in PvP and PvE.
---
You won't ever be as deadly as a Rogue, but you will be hard to kill and mobile as fuck. Annoying as hell to play against but very funny to play as.
---
It's like people didn't understand that vanilla is pretty tough because you're fighting against a faction and your own faction for gear. If you join a pug with master loot then you're asking to get ninja'd.
---
&gt; dagger rogue
---
We've been talking about raids.
---
Spoken like a true hobbyless person.
---
 i actually thought that his ninja loot was hilarous lol
---
Yes good spot there sir
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
It's not about "one bad experience", it's about the fact that they don't punish loot scammers in specific. Yet, if this guy who got scammed tried to get revenge on the loot scammer by advertising him an enchant and then keeping the materials, he would get punished for that. They pick &amp; choose which scams are okay and which aren't, with the most severe scams being a-ok. 
---
Personally, I wouldn't quit over this, but I totally understand why somebody would.
---
??? Okay 10 million people with the same goal and he beat them, your inital statements were that he was bad at the game, im now asking you to back this statement up in the face of him outdoing the worlds best guild at the time?
---
def quit asap
---
I think this is all being blown WAY out of proportion. This seems like an adequate response, if this doesn't assuage you I think you're way too invested. 
---
It's one piece of loot from one MC run in Classic, we can all move on now.
---
inspecting people will usually give you an indication of their guild's raid progress
---
Man what a entitled brat. He really thought he deserved that staff, just cus he plays a lot. Srsly stuff like this make me hate me method more and more.
---
Worked perfectly when I was there
---
Man for the past 20 years I always come back to these games !! I lost so many gaming diamonds but I never regret !!! Hail old school Blizzard !!!
---
At one point in time (Wrath, maybe BC, maybe after) GMs would enforce loot rules posted to raid chat.
---
Seems like they've just decided to do zero handling of anything with Classic.
---
Stealth and invisibility are two different things in wow Classic. The buff doesnt help to see rogues in stealth
---
But your were defending him...
---
But at that point, it's a scam, not a ninja loot. Not respecting a roll = ninja loot. Lying = scam.
---
I was primarily interested in using it for tanking, but maybe I'm off with that idea.
---
The top earners on one server are around 10-14 players depending on population. That is the same amount of players who can theoretically hit r14 the same week.
---
Sociopaths
---
You're not taking into account able minded people. Lowbies are the worst when it comes to dungeons.
---
Wailing Caverns can be done quickly if people know what they're doing. If not it's a long ass shitshow, basicaly nothing in between.
---
It's to fast for anyone so it's a nice stat stick
---
You can't talk to Highlord Taelan Fordring without the disguise. He's hostile.
---
After you talk to him and the escort begins, you can remove the disguise.
---
I'm spec for prot, so I was considering it as a tanking weapon with more stamina.
---
You should look into partnering with another guild for the time being that way you can keep your guild as it is until you recruit more.
---
I know, the non-thinking guide-lovers are a big community within classic.
---
"The key of leveling a warrior" might exist for people that do everything to optimize, but as OP is a guy that is in his 40s 3 months after release might not care about perfect optimization. 
---
Hell, he might even play a warrior that is not Orc or Human because he actually *likes to play his race instead*. Your head might explode realizing this.
---
It's moronic to devalue an epic drop when talking about Wow
---
Jokered. I MCC seems to be in a good State now but From what Ive heared je was t for a long time was he?

70g? What about the 4 blue sapphires.. Those alone are 120g on my server
---
All of our 30/0/21 shamans log like shit compared to our 5/46 shamans and it’s getting noticed. No ones dieing because of it, but people are deluding themselves if they think 30/0/21 is capable of keeping up with main healers let alone properly specd shamans and it’s going to be a real issue in BWL, which is more mana intensive than people like to admit here.
---
Early on, wands + dots are better for keeping uptime than spamming shadowbolt. Which is good. You should look into the drain tanking build as that is pretty much best for leveling until late 50s! But at 60 you should probably respecc to something like sm/ruin, ds/ruin, as dark pact hinders your dps pretty much as you have to sacrifice 100% crit dmg on destruction spells (ruin talent). 
---
Dark pact is very nice between pulls as you basically just drain your pets mana to you. (And using the imps fireball in dungeons isn’t really worth it IMO as the damage is negligible) Making healers not hate you. :)
---
Will phase 2 make low level questing easier since high levels don’t want to gank you because of dhk? Until lvl 52 of course.
---
Apple? Lol
---
Go to the cemetery by the ally FP in Western Plaguelands. There is an NPC there that gives you a 30 minute disguise.
---
Here’s to a good game. Good luck everyone.
---
That’ll learn em
---
I can't say that it will generate better aggro than whirlwind axe. But if you want to kill mobs faster, whirlwind axe is surely better because of your instant hit skills like overpower.
---
I don't think so, druids in bear form can't either, which gives them a nice advantage (also in sunken temple and probably lbrs, haven't done that one yet).
---
I guess him recording himself doing it, confessing, and narrating his reasoning weren't enough. Time to let this shitty human being step out of the limelight for a week until we all forgot about it and there end up being no consequences.
---
Tes imps pull the lashers. A reset with lashers is possible but it takes a death or portal reset (i do portal resets usually). Killing the lashers is a bit longer but alot more consistent.
---
I mean if you PvP you would appreciate being able to use Skull of Impending Doom and Furbolg Pouch without having to use a blue-quality trashcan sword/dagger
---
Definitely used, but it's also a terrible indicator of viewership. Vod numbers in general are incredibly low compared to concurrent live viewers.
---
Half of the instance is chasing Pusilin around for the key, quest and recipe.
---
You do not get a penalty for killing players, regardless of their level. Only civilian NPCs.
---
He was already struggling to hit even 1k
---
Holy fuck you're embarrassing. Stop?
---
stalagg was known as the nonstreamer server, and has 0 popular streamers.
---
Your abilities scale off weapon damage, not damage per second. Your whirlwind and mortal strike etc would hit like a wet noodle with that staff.
---
Some time ago as druid I realized that Abolish Poison and Cure Poison have exact same mana cost. So I had both on my binds for a long time and I only used Abolish Poison when there was stacking poison and Cure Poison if there was only one stack of poison.
---
They're not averages, it's called a span. Nice try though.
---
Works perfect unless you get ganked.
---
Aight. I made a toon on mograine yesterday but I might switch.

Nice system to avoid crime!

That's life

Or someone tags your npc at the end of the RP.
---
I've heard of some ST runs taking 6 hours in Vanilla. I have no idea how.
---
It is though. Say you're going vendorspec for one or two items each run, it really adds up. Especially later on once items give 5-7g. Two items a run and you are getting an extra 10g.
---
I've never done this myself :\^)
---
lol, guess you never stop learning, I always played pvp servers
---
But it is worse because they haven’t received the income from which the system uses. So if an item drops that is shared by multiple classes, the mages are more likely to get it.
---
Although I don’t know of such an Addon, you should try leatrix plus. It has an option to clean up the crafting tab while retaining the default appearance. I’m not sure off the top of my head if it adds a search function though.
---
Act like a cunt get treated like a cunt.

Blizz doesn‘t ban these bots. The mentioned ban waves affects exploiters and other hackers but if you run a normal script bot, you are safe and always will be.

Playing a bald gnome?
---
I mean he has a point. People are such babies. Outrage culture at its finest. Just look what the current "drama" is on this sub. Some streamer ninja looted something and people, even though they claim that they dont care about streamers whine about how awful he is. 
---
People complain about the smallest things and make a mountain out of a molehill.
---
They make it back easily. They make a ton of money because so many players are too lazy to go and grind it themselves.
---
Yup, that's why wands are resisted instead of missing
---
"Hey, when you post about me ninja looting, can you refer to me as Joker?"
---
Classic diablo 2 inc...
---
Watch how many people truly enjoy "world pvp" once battlegrounds roll out. 
---
Once they are out, the only thing that differs on PvP servers is that you get dicked by level 60s in STV when leveling alts or when trying to enter inatances.
---
Dispel is a %cost of their total mana. It's a smart tactic for 1v1's, but not so much in group pvp. Also mp5 scales hard, more than a priest or pallys mana pool so this tactic only gets less efficient the more geared they are.
---
Pahhh W Omegalul W drama
---
What do you do for entertainment?
---
definitely my favourite questing zone
---
Still have to buy the token on 40 accounts
---
what? no dude this is classic
---
You basically go to the gnome in the south infront of the Ally-town.
---
She will give you a disguise for 30 mins with which you can walk into the elite zone and talk to Highlord Taelan.
---
Hes going to tell you to remove the disguise and help him kill the mobs.
---
DONT DO THIS, keep it on, he wont attack you.
---
He will solo everything and wont die.
---
Later on he will approach the tower with the ?? Elite priest, dont come close to this guy, he knows you are in a disguise and is going to attack you, so keep distance to him.
---
They will kill Taelan and a minute or so later his daddy turns up and will clap some cheeks (dont help him here either, hes going to solo it)
---
After hes done clapping he will talk for a while and a minute or so later you can turn in the quest.
---
Join your server's Discord channel. Usually there is a subchannel for guild recruitment where guilds post their openings and another where people post their wow resumes and guilds can scan there.
---
Also blizzard official classic forums has a recruiting forum you could post in or look for guilds recruiting in. This is cross-server though, so I found it easier to use the sever specific Discord.
---
Run pug groups. Keep track of who plays well and nice, what guilds they are in. Which guilds have people being nice in chats... etc. 
---
Lastly, check warcraftlogs.com. Make sure to switch to the classic mode at the top. Then you can browse logs, see how guilds on your server do, what raid comp they run.. etc. Probably the best performance eval you can do.
---
Yeah MC is literally impossible without the Onyxia buff. Especially if you lose it to a trash mob wipe on the way to Lucifron.
---
No, they operate on BiS lists.
---
Gz
---
Every single rogue I've grouped with always rolls need on lockboxes. So I do as well
---
I completely agree. After 3-4 days of played at my lvl 60 priest I am just raid loging and playing other games now. There is nothing to do except farm mats for progress raids that will come months from now.
---
You might keep an eye out for recruitment messages, and make sure to talk to / chat with people from the guild to get a feel for their goals, their attitude and maybe also get an idea of the average age of people. If you're in your mid 20s or up it might get pretty annoying if the rest of the guild is way younger, or vice versa. 
---
If you happen to stumble into people you get a long with in a dungeon, make your best effort in that dungeon and check if they want to run some more, and chat with them a bit about their guild and whether they might need some more people. I found my current guild by running as a healer with a warrior from there and found myself healing 4/5 guild runs and eventually joining them.
---
If only money would cause streamer fanboys to not fanboy for once and pick a server they like themselves.
---
Exactly. Even imaqtpie once one of the top rated twitch streamer pulls around 2k viewers now. Used to be constantly 10k+
---
You can get full preraid bis in like 3 days of played np with some classes.
---
i mean, domo is there so rag is up
---
Or players.
---
yeah trade chat is one option probably better to /join lookingforgroup (be prepared for constant spam) as a lot of raiding guilds advertise here.
---
also the wow official website forums find your server a you will probably find a few guild ads on the forum. 
---
do lots of dungeons together and meet people. scouting happens a lot and you may find people ask you to join their guild.
---
I wish you luck with finding a good guild !
---
Hummm, no ? What seemed embarrassing to you ?
---
 Pwowetry. I love it.
---
He rolled down the hills of hinterlands and just kept rolling.
---
&gt;You are litterly exaggerating it by a factor 30 almost
---
No one cares. It was a hyperbole, on the internet, about an image of a video game. Are you actually this pedantic?
---
I am a programmer, I do plenty with maths every single day.
---
You could go back to retail
---
Oh woops. Looked like they were on the way out. My bad.
---
I actually just got that. It is better then the 14 shadow damage and 5 int warlock weapon wasn’t it.
---
I understand what you mean. I think earlier expansions it used to be more about the raid doing some sort of mechanic correct together. These days it's 100% about the individual doing mechanics. Some dude does 1 thing wrong in 10 minutes the entire raid wipes. Used to be that if 1 guy does something wrong they just die. and you continue the fight.
---
It also depends on what type of server you're playing on. While rogue is one of the most popular classes on PvP servers, it's one of the least popular ones on PvE servers.
---
I'd quit as well if someone ninja looted the Onyxia bag.
---
nahhhhhh
---
Druids are naturally being led to the EK by their class quest at level 14.
---
I've seen that one, it's trouble. I asked the city council more than once to help fix it, reply was budget constraints. After all, they are not a billion dollar company.
---
That's simply a skill/gear issue.  If you still need mana tide totem with the current raids, then there's an issue with your entire raid - healers are either overhealing or the boss isn't dying fast enough and people are standing in bad.  If you need the flat healing increase of purification for your shaman heals, then your shamans aren't properly gearing themselves with +healing power.
---
I was deep resto until I upgraded my healing set, and added +200 healing which well outpaces the flat increase from purification ( especially when downranking heals ).  Really look at what the talents are giving you and determine the benefit to a raid that's on farm ( and as easy as MC/Ony ).  I also log well for healing on the fights where I'm purely healing, in addition to being able to DPS with my spare mana on the easier fights.  
---
Naturally I plan on going deep resto for prog on BWL, but once it's on farm and I have additional healing I will swap back.
---
*laughs in Warlock*
---
No threat reducing talents at all, and one of the hardest hitting and highest threat generating spells in the game. Oh, and that spell is also your entire rotation.
---
Yeah there's certainly the odd pull where the group keeps going while I drink. 55 mage water is a must. Aggro can be an issue, fade doesn't seem to drop dps threat at all.
---
But you can come anyway
---
Who's the guy using a spray bottle the 17 seconds in?
---
Not even 98 guildies could cause me to transfer to a dead server with half of it's population being exiled ninjas where problems are even bigger than on the old server.
---
Someone running away from a 44/56 population because his whinyness is over the top to end up on an empty 20/80 server full of whiners and ninjas must be one of the funniest darwin occasions ever.
---
A game in which people put time and dedication to. When something unfair happens it's unpleasant, even if it's "just a game" bud.
---
Lol nice. I also kited him around he big trench in EPL. Got him to \~20% when a human rogue intervened to dps him down (I'm a horde hunter on a pve server). It's quite easy since it stops to cast the acid spit or whatever and you can safely outrange.
---
Rogues who do that are idiots. Can't fault a non-rogue for doing it to try and contest the need roll, but don't make need rolling a standard - merely a counter for when it is needed.
---
The NPC is at the way up to Uther's Tomb, southeast of Andorhal.
---
Get that nullable int outta my face.
---
I agree, almost every comment on this post is either ”Fuck him” or ”lol”
---
Anything but 'enjoying the journey' and going for your full t0 is private server/retail attitude and therefore not tolerated
---
They're investigating their contract with him to see if he's done anything to breach it.
---
Sadly we're alliance, so we thought about giving it to a pala
---
I once got stuck in a hole in STV at the arch on the way to bb.
---
To make things worse i was a ghost and couldnt even HS home.
---
After 10 minutes of jumping and struggling i finally found out of my misery.
---
Not early level dungeons if you’re running affliction. And really depends on what level you are. Checking hm dmg each of them do /s is smart when you’ve recently upgraded skills as one is not stronger than the other 100% of the time. Also if fight is long -&gt; coa, if short -&gt; corruption, but predotting coa on next target(s) usually bumps your dps up.
---
&gt; 10 nature res
---
Nightelves have that too btw :D
---
No, all for it actually
---
it is boring that one cannot ninja loot or break promises?  I think with personal loot you have the least loot drama. 
---
It's a shame that such loot behaviour doesn't get punished enough. It seems that you can do anything you want and get away with it.
---
What do you get when you cross a mentally ill streamer with a soon to be replaced epic drop?
---
YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE
---
rujnescape does it to. bots keep logs of literally every input and output that happens, and many people who bot bot on several accounts. If they were banned immediately upon detection, botters would be able to find patterns and better script their bots to avoid detection.
---
Yup people only show character when put in a  stressful or power situation
---
Since when is he a member of Method? Wasn't he like super trolling them and fucking them over at the race to 60?
---
Completely different scenario.
---
&gt; I mean wow.. Over a Staff of Dominance from Phase 1? Even a Mageblade and offhand is better.
---
I'm not a WoW player (r/all) I get the impression this was a relatively rare item but don't really have any context for your comment, could you put into context how stupid this was of him?
---
Staff is bad for warriors, and 2h is bad for tanking.
---
And yes you messed up the mechanics by releasing your corpse before everyone rolled.
---
Of course it means nothing. Levelling fast takes no skill, only dedication. Sleeping 8 hours in 4 days of your race to 60 isn't making him a great player by any stretch of imagination.
---
Gnomes are the very best mage 1vs1 class. 3 of their racials offer advantages in the matchup. Xaryu literally wiped the floor with him while removing most of his items on his UD mage. He's a really bad player overall.
---
13g 86s ain't shit :p
---
you write here but there are people starving or have no water. go there and build a well or something.
---
Does reporting these people do anything? If not then I'll follow your advice, thank you.
---
If it does I'll continue to right click, report and then hit my macro to say "goldseller/phishing channel invite"
---
He was the maintank ofc he taking it its not even a  ninja move lol
---
Oh no I always wait untill I see atleast 1 need roll before rolling. I do the same with BoEs. If a mage Rolls need on a 2H axe the so do I
---
Because horde have by far better racials etc for pvp (wotf being biggest factor, stun resists, warstomp), while alliance has a lot better stuff for pve (blessing of salvation, fear ward, human sword skill to name a few).
---
That’s just the vicious cycle of twitch. A lot of the big streamers from 2013-2015 are slowing down now after the twitch explosion in popularity. I almost always saw Sodapoppin or Lirik at 30k viewers now they hover at 10k. Eventually it’ll just whittle down until they quit. Twitch to me now is basically: Get into some scandal that gives you exposure, milk it for a few months, then work with the scraps you have leftover rinse and repeat
---
*neverlina
---
Wow you're really squeaking in at the right time!
---
I play on an official server and this bug is pretty common too.
---
Even if you're 60, if you do't have your epic by now you're gonna get ran down and murdered over and over by groups.
---
This guy reminds me of Eddie, the temporary roommate from Friends.
---
Woof. Well thanks for being straight with me.
---
How much kills is 5000cp more or less do you reckon?
---
The items are definitely hit or miss, depending whose online and needs the items. The rings always sell, I've never had to vendor one. So that's a 25-40g guarantee on drop. If they're not Druid or Rogue, I tend to charge a little more for my escort service (like 5g). If it's a non-stealth class it can take a good amount of time and effort. 
---
The potions are from the chest. You get 2 slots for potions. I'm not sure the exact amount that rolls, but I seem to always get 5+ per chest. (3 mana 2 hp, 3 mana 3 mana, etc)
---
You always get about a stack each (16-20) of Morning Glory Dew and Roasted Quail. 
---
You get 2 blue items minimum from King Gordok, with a chance at any of the DM books, arcanums, etc. These blue items are not sellable, and are always vendored. (unless someone is present for the king kill, but I haven't heard of hunters doing that). Lowest possible value is 3.14g, highest value (without rare items) 10.94g.
---
AVG: 6.175g
---
You get 2x green items from the chest. I haven't tried to sell any of these to players, but i'm sure some of them are decent enough to be able to. Lowest possible value is 1.97g, highest possible value is 8.24g. AVG: 4.367g
---
You get 3x blue items from the chest (assuming you talk to Kromcrush before spawning chest). Just purely vendoring, lowest possible value is 2.48g (includes Engineering pattern, which can roll on a blue slot). Without pattern, 3.79g. Highest possible value is 20.31g. (not including epic axe).AVG: 9.602g
---
Epic axe sells for 200g+
---
So the AVG for a run of purely vendoring is 20.144g. Doesn't include potions/food/water/cloth. 
---
I spend about 1g per Large Seaforium, 1.6-2g per Invisibility potion. I just switched to Lesser Invisibility as I'm much more confident with the runs now. So roughly less than 3g per run, with 17g avg profit. I do runs in about 20-25 mins, so 3ish per hour. 
---
Making the grand total of this wall of text: 51gph AVG purely vendoring items.
---
ret paladins were a meme in vanilla  aswell bro.
---
High level players have no more reason to kill you now than they did before phase 2. They don't get punished, but they don't get any rewards either.
---
Are there any addons that let you see guild chat when you're logged off or is that a retail only thing?
---
We've all been there, so no worries :D
---
Oh lawd
---
AS a Warrior i can agree, Rogues are by far the most overpowered class i can think about. It gets absurdly crazy when they use evasion I can legitimately not think about how overpowered they get with this buff, HOLY.
---
Why did you make that plural? He levelled up fast by abusing layering. That's the only achievement he's done.
---
&gt; Nah they were just ~~tired~~ *excited* of having ~~to die 5-10 times to get into UBRS or BRD~~ *no balls*
---
Had a few people get known for ninjaing shit on my server already. I keep track of the ones I know of, it's hilarious to me watching them not able to find a new guild or quit. Consequences are why I came back to classic. Love seeing the deserving suffer them.
---
Imagine ruining your carreer over a piece of Molten Core loot which will be outdated when BWL comes out.
---
Why would you need more than 6 bars? I'm a hunter and use 3 bars, including consumables. Also ItemRack.
---
Try combine stuff with modifier macros. RingMenu gives some extra buttons as well.
---
You aren't wrong but the way you worded it made it sound like it's the womans fault because they are sluts. It's the opposite end. No female in a top 50 guild because all the neckbeards will literally stop focusing and try impress this female who plays vidya games. Same reason women couldn't serve on the front line, men will be inclined to help a female who is wounded/down when it may compromise the entire squad in doing so.
---
That's because you're a nerd
---
It is exactly to avoid botting. They are doing it to kill not just individual bots but bots in general
---
Whirlwind and mortal strike do an instant attack with your weapon, slower weapons have a higher dmg range, while faster weapons might have identical dps, but lower dmg range. Ww and ms can "cheat" extra attacks in, so the slower weapons benefit more from this.
---
Yeah you also there so we don’t have to disenchant the loot as well
---
Except a SL lock can isntantly summon another pet
---
There's space for 1-2 Enhancement shamans in most raids simply due to the fact that they bring improved WF and Str totems for 4-8 other players, and they push OK damage. 
---
If you think you'd want a swing at healing, they are some of the most competent raid healers across the board. Sure, with the sick items priests can get their hands on (Benediction, Truefaith vestments) you really can't compete with them on mostly single target fights, but on fights with high raid damage you can give them a ride for their money. It does seem a well geared priest should always beat you, but you can push some very strong healing while bringing a crapload of utility to most any situation.
---
also, theres /world an equally popular channel if not more so than Lfg channel.
---
Context?
---
They are balanced for what they were intended to be balanced for.
---
I'm obviously speaking of the future. The world first 60 isn't hold by Method since they picked him up after. They wanted him to make them achievements in the future.
---
Raids are basically always done via "master looter", where one person does all the loot distribution. It's easier to trust one player to distribute it fairly and honor player /rolls, than to trust everyone in the raid to not need on items they aren't supposed to get. But sometimes the master looter pulls something like this and it sucks.
---
Didnt you guys do SM cath less than a week ago? That powerlevling tho
---
This is satisfying.  How small are the margins of your life that being good at WoW turns you into such a ponce?
---
Bro warriors can do 600 and the 300 dps lock will pull guaranteed
---
5000
---
Source? All I have is their [official response](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr2h8q) that mentions "he has been suspended from Method pending further investigation into the future of his contract as a WoW Classic Influencer"
---
You're making a large assumption if that's your takeaway from that statement.
---
I assume the investigation is to see if his actions violate the terms of his contract to warrant permanent removal. There are tonnes of talented content creaters that can take his spot in Method within days if he's removed and saving face in the content world is more important for Method than Jokerd's contributions.    
---
If the actions violate their terms, he's done. If not then they can't get rid of him, just refuse to renew his contract when it's due.
---
But lets be real, if you are a streamer who's mum lives with them so you can take care of them, all your community/everyone else is going to say you live with your parents, I'd rather not address it unless it came up on stream
---
Its 28 sp worse than blade, thats 5-10% of most casters total sp. It not that good, pre bis is +7sp &amp; -1 crit for warlock and +2sp -1 crit for mages. Its a decent upgrade to pre bis but its not a good weapon.
---
And what does this have to do with anything i said?
---
My guild had a few women in it during our time on top in TBC/Wrath.
---
Super interesting! Never heard of that, but it‘s actually a very cool concept. This makes every raid and the time spend worth it for every participant. How often did all of us went raiding and left the raid with nothing but rep costs. 
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
I love this reference
---
Yea happend to me to a rouge ninjad chest of valor in UBRS becasue he lost a roll om dalrend got gkicked as far as i know and i Will keep hunting him if he joins a new one
---
Ah, that's really just 1 kill for 1 CP. Ok, I did not expect that.
---
I honestly think that like 95% of asmongolds stream is scripted at this point. There is no way most of it is legit.
---
Right now you can get 20 more sp with Spirit of Aqua or 11 more sp and about the same raw stats if you used the fire-etched grimoire(?) Going into BWL you have access to the AV oh which you should bring out anyways for 34 shadow damage. 74 shadow damage and 1% crit or 40 spell damage and 1% crit. Easy choice in any situation
---
Depends on player and weapon. If you have the 2h sword from Ragnaros you can dish out quite good dps because of the armor ignoring buff. In comparison, The Hand of Ragnaros on a fury warrior is equal or worse DPS wise than dual wielding the UBRS rend weapons. 
---
Basically 2h can be awesome but is more heavily dependent on having just the right weapon.
---
The joke is that Jokerd ninjad it. Then acted like a complete twat on stream. So Method suspended him pending investigation. So he paid for it with his career.
---
ok I see :) I'm much more in favor of individual loot, removes the head aches :p
---
Negotiations take time
---
Oh dear. T0.5 is called T0.5 because T0 and T1 already existed and T0.5 is in between those, so the only possible name is T0.5.
---
Why do you assume T0.5 and T2.5 are .5 sets for the same reason? The whole point of a Tx.5 set is that it is an intermediate set and this can be either because it was released later than other sets, as is the case with T0.5 (released after T0 and T! were out for over a year) or because it's not a full Tier set, as is the case with T2.5
---
Just chillin here nice subject by the way
---
Yep far better, int is pretty bad for us in pve really as our mana pool is not relevant due to lifetap. 60 int is equal to about 1% crit which at full pre raid best in slot is equal to 14 spell power, with crit being less valuable at lower gear levels.
---
I guess you mean Blasted Lands? The Blasted Lands buff do stack if you log out during the cooldown.
---
/join LookingForGroup is the official blizzard global channel, you can also join it thru the settings/options from chat tab
---
Could it not be balanced around fitting those roles? Balance can mean a lot of different things in video games.
---
You must be a blast to play with
---
What is the etiquette for rolling on dark runes in scholo?
---
In my run the mana users all needed and me and the two rogues greeded.
---
About 10 dropped, they are worth quite a bit - how do I know the mana users won't just sell them?
---
Phase 2 I'm guessing. Senseless honor killings and such :P
---
”On an american server” Sir, you just endes your whole career.
---
I outheal everyone else in my raids so it's better spent on myself if there's a chance I'd otherwise run out of steam.  
---
Mostly I innervate a priest in bad shape because I generally don't need it myself.
---
I outheal everyone else in my raids so it's better spent on myself if there's a chance I'd otherwise run out of steam.
---
Get out of here with your retail character models
---
A smart hunter always have a trap down all times
---
Likely wouldn't force you to change if you were called coca cola and just playing the game, it's free advertisement! But if you were called Coca Cola spamming racist shit in org and Coca cola got wind of it, they for sure would make blizzard make you change the name. It's about brand image more than anything else
---
How's that going to end his career, unless Blizzard steps in? Like it or not, but twitch feeds on drama and this incident won't cost him many viewers.
---
The guy above isn't right, but not quite wrong either. 
---
HKs give CP, the amount of CP you have determines your rank and the rank gives certain amount of RP.

My 40 wives! :D

what a sad loser lol

way to ruin your only income for pixels

Laughs in reck pally

Youll outlvl the weapons too quick for it to really matter, but if youre minmaxing look for axes as an orc
---
The thing about asmon is that everyone already knows the loot is going to him beforehand. There's no surprise.
---
&gt;WoW Classic Influencer
---
For the love of God.  Fuck off.
---
they definitely made it to live, i remember seeing the Rogue t2 helm
---
Sign for a organization who has a reputation to uphold and then go and do stupid shit like this. Offcourse youre gonna get kicked out.
---
i beg to differ. I mean female Trolls aren't exactly beautiful but i think hunter suits them very well. It just looks right when they're shooting a bow, you know? Plus i think it fits nicely fantasy wise.   
---
If i was looking for a "nice" looking character then i'd probably have to roll alliance but i don't like sitting on 12 inch dragon dildos and that was a requirement to join i heard?
---
&gt; Ony head buff
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22888/rallying-cry-of-the-dragonslayer
---
Got ya. I appreciate it.
---
Always crusader on 2h unless youre a hunter. Think of it as "Chance on hit: Gain 200 Attack Power"
---
whirlwind axe is better than that staff for warriors. The only next upgrade you should be looking for as a warrior is Executioner's cleaver, and after that the BRD axe.
---
I'm 54 and for the past two days there were already some level 60s quite obviously practicing for this phase.
---
I've been contemplating rerolling for a while now because I stupidly believed my friends would play with me and after they've all quit and those 60s won't let me level I said fuck it and just rerolled to another faction on another server.
---
I will now level a new character in peace until the p2 dust settles. Ganking doesn't even phase me as much but those fucking corpseruns man... Everytime I'm forced to do those long ass corpseruns it feels like it's another 30mins on top of the already ridiculous time it takes to go through a level. And just as I get back into the flow of it BOOM another corpserun. Fuck that.
---
How are you bird?
---
Wiping loads in BRD without any idea where to go is the TRUE vanilla experience.
---
Wait what's the first then :O
---
Every time the Onyxia bufg comes an entire city lags
---
ah, I thought you meant retail xD, sorry, I get it now, well yeah that is one way to look at it
---
Holy shit mate this is waaaaaaaaaaaay too important to you. 
---
My server called it the blue set t0.5, just fuckin deal with it, jesus christ.
---
You are bigger joker than the actual sreamee OmegaLul indeed.
---
Not possible, blizzard changed the api for a ton of things in classic to keep the classic feel.
---
Method guild leader's gf used to raid with the main roster for a while, didn't she?
---
If you don't want to use addon, you can right click the mount buff icon to cancel it. For emergency abilities such as blink you can macro it:
---
    #showtooltip Blink
---
    /dismount
---
    /cast Blink
---
Oh yeah this was 15 mins before the buff :)
---
Trust me he ain’t normal. Did you hear his music playlist when he was about to hit 60?
---
it just refreshes
---
People like crowded places. No ones blaming blizzard for that cause it's fun, I think people are blaming blizzard for not making the game playable when it is crowded.
---
No runecloth bags? Oh, jackasses are still botting Qia on your server too? Neat.
---
Much of classic pvp is like that through. Imagine pvping with engineering.
---
Perfect place to hide out pvp patch until BGs get emergency released!
---
What a complete douche, this is embarrassing for Method. I hope he doesn’t get let back in, and I’m glad this issue has gotten the traction it’s got!
---
Well you tried
---
Ele is supposedly better for leveling after 40ish (trying it now on my shammie).  
---
Personally our guild doesn't have an ele or enhance shammie.  One tried it for a week or so but it didn't go well even on short MC fights.  It doesn't help some bosses like Garr are either mostly or completely resistant to nature dmg which basically means an ele shammie is going to twiddle his thumbs and throw out subpar heals.  Not sure if later raids have similar resistances (AQ40 seems like some might have some nature resist).  Mages can swap between fire/frost but ele shammies are pretty much 100% reliant on nature dmg.
---
2h is more threat than 1h. You just need to notice if you are lacking threat or mitigation
---
....i dont even fucking play wow. you might be a bit too invested in this game. take a breather, go outside or some shit. get a new damn hobby.
---
Can anyone who has followed him after his 1-60 WF tell me how he / his streaming has developed? I watched him a lot when he "trained" for the Classic launch with multiple 1-60 runs on private servers. There was no camera, little voice and just him playing plus good music.   
---
After he hit 60 on Classic I just tuned in once in a while and most of the time it seemed he had nothing really to do, was in some game house in the US from the looks of it and seemed to be chatting up some female Swedish Twitch streamer. 
---
Has he shown any indicators of being able to become a good &amp; entertaining streamer?
---
I do scholo runs ignoring jandice in 35-45min.
---
It's funny when two( i presume adults here) write as patronisingly as they can while somewhat ignoring each others responses.
---
Same. &lt;3 Esfand evening VODs.
---
Did you read realm forums back in vanilla? Massive nerd outrage over the tiniest slights is in the DNA of WOW. It has nothing to do with "outrage culture".
---
Ninja loot and broken promises should and usually is punished in one way or another. The boring part of personal loot system is that effectively you can’t play with other people using it. It punishes good players for willing to help others. 
---
We had the Azhara trinket dropped for our healer the other day and despite her best intentions to give this trinket out to the dps and increase overall raid potency she couldn’t do that because she didn’t had appropriate dps trinkets before. It’s boring at this point of expansion, but loot rules still in place in order to protect people from loot drama in a world where blizz remove lots of cs people to help resolve those manually
---
No, THAT'S irrelevant. That post says that Blizzard will not transfer items from player to player. It doesn't say anything about refuse to ban players who abuse other players.
---
Being in your place with a wife, kids and job. I understand. Though I believe my wife is more understanding as she likes to play retail (she didn't like classic). My priest is 60 with quite a few epics. Im also slowly leveling my rogue which is 32 atm. I can tell you 30-43? Is the most painful I find anyway. Alot of running around and doing each zone multiple times. Just keep pushing you will get there. Just take it at your own pace and have fun.
---
It's dirt cheap on Golemagg EU though, it's the ONLY way to actually win vs a rogue opening on you, so yeah, you carry this shit over pet food kek
---
It's not gatekeeping, it's a dose of reality and a much needed perspective
---
&gt; So... you want retail. It's there waiting for you, and it's improved a lot since TBC. Seriously, go try it, it sounds like exactly what you want.
---
I tried retail. 
---
You can't fly.
---
Professions are meaningless/pointless.
---
Nobody's doing anything other than spamming mythic+ , as high as possible, with the most toxic atmosphere you could imagine; you can't even get into groups thanks to some addon that means nothing. If your class is not fotm, forget about it. At the end of the week, you get an item you never wanted in a chest. 
---
Instances are just ugly AND stupid, there's basically no work put into them.
---
Raids are even dumber. 
---
I can't imagine what made you think I wanted retail. Nobody I know wants to have anything to do with "retail". Even the worst wow player I know could tell you (and Blizzard) that it's all wrong and generally a waste of time. Unfortunately, nobody at Blizzard thought of asking anyone...
---
Yeah this screenshot was taken after a while :D 
---
After I realized it's taking so long that I have time for one WC3 game, waited 5 minutes there and then got the idea for the screenshot :D
---
On Bladefist EU during vanilla the entire hillsbrad zone was nearly off-limits for questing due to the ever ongoing Tarren Mill vs Southshore battle raging on.   
---
And even after AV came out it was a frequent place for big showdowns.
---
Yeah, I do. I'm just saying there could very likely be 20 players better than the Method roster (in terms of execution/ability), who just can't put the time in to world first raid. So in that regard it's the same as classic;  the biggest factor is having the time to play, not skill. If the most skilled raider in the world said to method "Hey I can only do 2 hours/night for 3 nights during progress" do you think they'd take them?
---
Did you completely misunderstand the context? /u/cippopotomas clearly quoted "acts like a douche" which wasn't a reference to the ninjaing of the staff, but rather his attitude and behaviour afterwards. At least put in minimal effort to understand the context before trying to belittle someone else.
---
Doubt it. He isnt really worth anything to them anymorem his stream is trash since he hasnt done shit since he hit 60. Not to mention the fact that he's garbage at the game.
---
Well i think he aint getting that pc anymore. And he lost some good sponsor money over it too. But, people watch tyler1 too so he will have an audience.
---
Dw, I remember a time I bought Rune Thread off the AH and complained about the price so...
---
kill if before it lays eggs
---
Staff of Dominance - 40 Spell Power.  
---
Magehand + Off hand - 60 Spell Power
---
&gt; How is this any different than what Asmongold does every raid? 
---
On the streams of him running MC on his Warlock? The loot rules are clearly established beforehand (Asmon takes everything he can use) and everyone joining the raid thereby accepts that. Therefore he cannot be ninjaing. 
---
&gt; But isn't this the same behavior?
---
Regarding behaviour, are you referring to "ninjaing" or acting like a toxic douchebag?
---
&gt; I'm thinking about the stuff you couldn't get: Scarab Lord, Hand of A'dal, Raid mounts (assuming they do Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, BFA servers).
---
I got those - except for Scarab Lord - at the right time. I still have the Hand of Adal title on retail, the Kael'thas phoenix (Alar) and god knows what else. But I'm absolutely fine with having separate realms for classic and bc; I wouldn't want to take classic away from classic players. If that's what they prefer, that's what they should be able to play.
---
Just look at the top end damage. That’s the only stat you’re gonna care about
---
Had the same thing in brm, stealthed up and hid from a few alliance, yet a gnome warlock had no problem seeing me despite not being close and to the side and dotted me right up. Only conclusion I can think of is invisibility buff.
---
Weak threat to try to force the hand of the GM, could have worked on another one. It mostly come off as whimpy though
---
And then blowing a sweet kiss to your career as it floats away out of reach.
---
You loot policed some trash blue no one cares about five levels down the road? Maybe he wanted to catch up to 2h swords because that is an utter pain in Classic.   
---
I bet the players really just wanted to not ruin the group for a dungeon that is hard enough to group for because everyone rather runs SM Cath at that level...  
---
did you even steal from the Paladin in return, or did you take robes of the lich from them?
---
45min strat ud sounds about right in my experience since you can skip most packs
---
Can I lost points?
---
He's been taken off the stream team.  And suspended whilst they investigate the future of his contract.  Meaning they can't simply fire him straight away if they have a contract.
---
Real men have angles!
---
Method: "Hey Jokerd, how 'bout a magic trick? I' m gonna make your partnership, disappear.. Taaadaaan and, it's gonee"
---
What about it was hilarious? And in what way? I'm genuinely curious.
---
“Speed ran his own career” LMAO
---
An organisation like Method will drop him like it's hot because that'll get them the good PR. He wasn't briging in the big viewership (anymore) so after this stunt he is literally detrimental to them.
---
Just FYI it is also really full and has large queues pretty much every day

Some people do it even for free though.
---
Well just saying, he made money before method, hes guild loved it, hes wievers loved it.
---
Its fun Reading the comments, everybody says that they dont care, still they type up 4 page essay to explain how mutch they dont care?
---
So to sum this up, he dont care, he will still have the same  size of wievers he will still make hes money even if method has suspended him.
---
He will still get sponsorships because he generates wievers and this sub will always hate himand this sub is helping jokerd right at this moment by not stop talking about him, ppl (wievers, sub reeaders who does not kow him will not have a reason to look him up and now he has a chanse to generate new wievers because of you :D have a nice day :)

You spelled warRior wrong.

Sorry to burst your justice bubble but high end raiding is only about being good and knowing people. Most top end guilds players probably find this funny and even more so how the casual community reacts.
---
it is too long :(
---
This guy is from my town and went to the same high school as me. He hasn't changed at all. This isn't shit compared to the other things he has done in the past.
---
Haha
---
yea thats what i was getting at, i dont doubt some women play into it but a majority of the blame is on weird horny internet dudes, its easier to just say 'no girls allowed' than deal with the drama it can create, maybe im a bit jaded cuz ive had guilds in 3 different expansions implode over woman drama lol
---
and its fun to get the same cookie cutter angry responses from middle aged women ngl
---
Get a dog, everything else is dodging a gigantic life ruining bullet.
---
casuals am I right...
---
But then you have a kid though... /s (or is it?!?!)
---
Free publicity
---
Haha, that is naughty! Damn
---
Shouldn't he what? Be booted from Method? Absolutely. I just said that gaining a few viewers wasn't worth it *for him*.
---
I'm on Pyrewood as well! Ironforge was glorious when I was on last night. Takes me back.
---
This is my thinking too. As long as it isn't painfully egregious like rolling on intellect items, I think needing should be fine. Otherwise we're just scrutinizing every looting decision.
---
I think WoW is a lot like Super Smash Bros. Melee. A lot of things were put in intentionally, but no one had even a vague idea of how the various pieces would interact with each other if you give players enough time. This game hasn't seen development in 15 years, and when that happens and players are looking to change the status quo or the meta, they get innovative. That's how things like MCP for Druids were discovered.
---
wow sounds like a decent gold farming strat
---
All NPCs are not civilians. So I don't think you are much safer in any regard.
---

---
Tipsouts family company that was a big fraud
---
You're pathetic
---
If was just as busy, crazy
---
Good decision from Method. I get the feeling they may have been looking for an excuse to get rid of him anyway.
---
And Asmongold's response to the tweet is : "Should have waited for mageblade". When being famous excuses you for shitty behavior...
---
He might not care about his reputation on the server. But I guess the financial and other benefits he got from Method will hurt.
---
That's what you get from not understanding that such a huge organization doesn't like bad PR and has no problem cutting people out who hurt their image.
---
Bloodrage on cooldown* for phatter dps!
---
*Assuming my survival is not remotely threatened.
---
Yea it makes a lot of sense for pugs, but for guild runs it takes away a big part of the game and excitement imo.
---
You're a huge cunt do you know that? Going out of your daily life to write such a comment and wanting others to feel bad about themselves only because they care about a subject.. lowlife pathetic cunt

---
I am happy I left Noggenfogger for Judgement. I think I halved my time to get to 60 thanks to the switch, leveling was smooth. Problem with Judgement is that it's pretty deserted compared to Noggenfogger. It's already decently hard getting a group together for dungeons at max lvl, it's literally impossible to form one when leveling an alt. Still got all the elite quests from Redridge...
---
yeah in like 10 hours or so
---
Points for you
---
People are snowflakes.

I mean look at pve servers, the entire reason pve servers exist is snowflakery.

It's a gnome, you smart guy!

Fun ghing is people on retail thinks classic is a failure
---
Am I blind or is Brutality Blade from Garr missing?
---
Yeah they just fixed them this week after everyone got used to them doing nothing.
---
You can also do /join World and there's another chat that everyone's in
---
If you are talking about the multiple attacks instead of the guards not retaliating. This is due to a "clever use" of Reckoning. [Here's a demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MHIkMhSfc)
---
&gt;Live your own life man, that right there is a waste of time.
---
Are you being sarcastic by posting this on classic wow thread?
---
Is it nice for hordies mate? I can’t decide if i stay or go this realm
---
Also some people are really stingy with money, and even if they could easily afford to pay their own place they'd rather live rent-free with the parents.
---
Blizzard doesn't care about ninjas, lol. Try to report one, you'll see.
---
Haha neerrrrrrrrrd
---
T1 also had a first design. I remember getting my T1 gloves on my shaman, they looked like giant red mitts to take a hot dish out of the oven.
---
How is Shaman DPS (Melee or Caster) in raids? Are they just not as good as others, or is it so bad that it makes no sense to take a damage shaman to raids?
---
He doesn't raid with method lol, he's an "influencer" on their stream team. He raids in Power and I'm pretty sure staysafe won't care about what people on Reddit think about Jokerd since they're friends.
---
Does druid tank need 9% hit to tank?
---
I'm not sure why tho... I understand it's annoying but since it's a game mechanic it's nothing that should be punished. It's like killing lower lvl players in world Pvp, maybe wrong but it's a part of a game so just deal with it and go ninja'd items from someone else I guess
---
It usually ends up being 1 player per faction per server, but not always. Dont be surprised if you see 3 or even 4 hit r14 at the same week in the beginning. For a rundown on how the system works, I recommend checking out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw
---
The stacked raids are only run for speedrun attempts, usually once or twice every 3 months or so. The rest of the time, the raids are balanced range/melee.
---
2 days ago, I was in BRD and was adamant guards and spectators drop aggro when you jump in the arena, and it was not the case at all. They just ran by the exit ramp and went through the closed door. Was it a bug?
---
I watched some vids and it seems like he doesnt give a flying fuck about being "fired" from method. Dunno if it was because he was tilted (6h+ raid) but he didnt seem to care much about what could happen after.
---
Quilver doesn't work. But agility crit still affects quote tooltip "all weapons". Wands are not spells, they don't get affected by spell dmg or spell crit. They are affected by weapon crit!
---
I did the quest chain for Vectus to make his room easy, and killed him dozens of times and finally the +shadow neck dropped from him last night.   Vectus, with dawns gambit, doesnt take long at all.  5 mins tops.
---
I love scholo tbh but i aint setting foot back in there for a little while. :)
---
What time is the scheduled maintenance today?
---
I play Alliance on PvP server with 60:40 ratio in Horde favor. It is fun when factions take turns wiping each other at entrance to BRD, but it gets annoying if you need to waste 20 minutes every day to be able to simply walk into the dungeon.
---
Nahh Ele isnt viable. It is just more viable than enh. Because you can heal better and deal a bit more damage.
---
You will still ride the back end of the DPS, have to use Major Mana potions and Dark Runes on CD and still wont deal damage on most bosses. 
---
Basically, heal shamans are an asset. Except for one enh. Shaman, the other speccs are just taken as buffbots for the characters that actually provide stuff for the raid.
---
It’s in the very name. Instanced dungeon. Instance
---
SP rotation while leveling relies on wanding but raiding/endgame dungeons do not. I only ever use my wand at ony otherwise i'm spamming rank 1 mindflay when oom to keep up shadow weaving and do more dmg than wand because of all the +spell power.
---
For raiding you may find it tough to find a spot, even more so at this point where those few SP spots have been filled in guilds.
---
nah the sm cath was ages ago, just didnt get around to editing the vid until last week :-)
---
Passionate over few pixels to the point people'd like to punch the guy? Y'all need help.
---
You are jumping to conclusions. 
---
They changed to masterloot with the intention to ninja.
---
also getting laughed at by hundreds or thousands of people every day alone in your bedroom probably isn’t great for mental health
---
This happened on my first attempt, he got wrecked by the patrol. Second solo attempt I was able to finish the quest though.
---
Because you claimed I missed a decade which seems to be aimed at my statement:
---
&gt;it wasn't until smartphones became widespread (early to mid 2010's) that we had everyone pretty much online.
---
He's trying to explain to you that the overwhelming vast majority of people back in 2004 either did not use internet at all or the way we use it the way we relate to today. The people who knew how to use computers fully (and not just follow instructions), who knew how to use the internet and set it up, who knew how to play games online, and who further invested into communities built into these online games were VERY different from the general population. It may not seem like a selective group by today's standards, but trust me, the group back then were a much techier and nerdier group of people.
---
It was really around 2013 when I started noticing the influx of "casuals" in various online communities. There was a sudden dilution. I believe the main cause of this is the widespread use of smartphones. Smart phones are much more accessible and much simpler to use than setting up a pc + modem + accessories. The OS is also much more intuitive and simple. People constantly accessed the internet vs waiting until they got home from work and school.
---
&gt;I mean, there's not much else to investigate, what he did is pretty clear cut.
---
Right, that's why it just seemed like face saving bullshit meant to appease troubled minds while they wait for things to blow over and continue to gauge public reaction. If people forget in a week and his sub count goes up then I don't think they'll terminate anything. 
---
&gt;But if he hasn't done anything to breach his contract, they can't just terminate it.
---
Stuff like this happens all the time in esports and people get canned constantly. It's a multi-million dollar e-sports team contracting a small time teenager to play classic wow. Take a look at that power disparity between these 2 parties, you think they wouldn't have a way to terminate that contract if they so much as feel like it? All they'd have to do is call him an at-will employee and they fire him whenever they want. 
---
Their reputation is far more valuable than any one person and they know it, these boiler plate contracts were made with this in mind.  What is he gonna do about it, negotiate a better deal? As if somebody else is gonna come along and make his dream come true with a more fair contract. Or there aren't another hundred thousand kids willing to sign that contract if he doesn't.
---
Someone told me you can only progress 1 rank at a week, is this true?
---
His guild on classic is unrelated to method.
---
&gt; Just ends up being who has a more co-ordinated Zerg that spam AoE before the others and get insta-gibed
---
That's literally mass-scale PvP in classic though. Whoever is better prepared and better organized wins the fight. Numbers help of course but time showed again and again that 5 people with sappers can wipe a raid of 40 if they clump up
---
1g
---
DO YOU KNOW HOW I GOT THESE SCARS IN MY FACE?
---
You could try sell it on the neutral AH for 1000g+ I think there are some shamans who would pay even more than that too
---
Working as intended. Dont jump down.
---
He never raided with method
---
Just need to do what we did in the old days, spread the word about them. That's a nice ninja loot mate, good luck finding another group on this server for that toon. 
---
Communities can soft ban characters of they work together.
---
That's pretty cringe dude.
---
PvP and PvE are 2 entirely different playing fields, it's absolutely stupid to even compare the two. There's tons of Mythic Raiders who wouldn't have a clue on how to PvP, and there's tons of PvP players who couldn't do mythic raids to save their lives.
---
Strategy making and raid decisions are a HUGE part of mythic raiding, especially if you're trying to compete for World First like the hypothetical here. Method is literally responsible for making most of the strategies that are used to kill most bosses. Take them out of the picture and suddenly it gets a lot harder to clear these. There's a reason why so many guilds were afraid of streaming their progression, they know how much of a hit it would be to reveal their strategy.
---
I'm sure that many of them could come to retail and be competitive, but as a group/organization, they wouldn't stand a chance against Method or Limit for at least a few raid tiers. What they do to prepare for classic is light years away from what retail progression looks like.
---
The analogy to SC2 is beyond stupid, since transitioning from Classic Raiding to Mythic Retail raiding is tenfold harder, whereas completing the campaign on hardest difficulty is something that most people can do with some level of awareness, let along top professionals who probably already have done it for fun at some point.
---
I don't think they only do it for loot. Some people dig who ever is in charge.
---
Its like a real warzone in warcraft. I love it.
---
Good ridance, people like him dont need the attention
---
Well, that made my morning.
---
I’m sorry I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just when you are addicted to wow and spend all your free time playing, when do you actually find somebody?
---
How does a soft DKP decay remedy the problem? If you're first on DKP, you will still be first on DKP after decay. I'd rather waste millions of DKP to get my BiS weapon first.
---
Dungeons are instances, not layers.

&gt; “They think I care about my reputation on a fucking American server”

\- Jokerxd, ***WHILE STREAMING ON A GLOBALLY ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE***
---
Did he seriously not expect people from all over the world to be watching?
---
You have to be Exalted with the Winterspring Trainers. Basically you have a choice from several repeatable kill-quests in Winterspring. A couple of the quests are easier and can be solo'd, but there is also a quest to kill the Elite Giants in the south that gives you more rep, but requires a party and has a longer travel time back and forth to the quest giver. 
---
Someone calculated the rough amount of quests you have to complete from Neutral -&gt; Exalted as;
---
Soloable quests: 840 turn-ins  
---
Elite Giant quest: 760 turn-ins  
---
So you're talking a substantial amount of time not only doing these kill-quests over and over, but also the travel time between the Q-giver and the quests themselves. I don't know the hour count but it's crazy long. It's the epitome of "Vanilla grinding".
---
This guy did.  
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokySpinelessDonkeyBudStar](https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokySpinelessDonkeyBudStar)
---
I was reffering to pulling accidently but you answered that aswell! Didn’t think about pets beeing lower level which might attract other packs. And yeah if you set your imp on passive and don’t order him to att it’s pretty much a stamina/fire shield(if no thorns) buff to the team. Lesser invisibility/phase shift only works when not attacking however.
---
Okay so you just can't go on an Arena run by the door if you have a underlevel healer ? You need to at least clear the different pack and some of the spectator then
---
When he dinged 60 he didn't do a damn thing. HE could have turned on his comms, answered Q&amp;A, chatted with people, explained things, developed a personality and started interacting with viewers and having a good time. He would have made BANK. He had 400k people listening to him. There is no single better time for him to develop his own brand. So yeah, he could have done a lot lot lot more than he did which was say nothing, then delete his character and turn off stream.
---
dunno
---
take a look at Hyubsama, was averaging 1.5 now cant break 300
---
$g being a boolean wouldnt fly these days. Would need atleast a ten member enum.
---
Since there’s no definitive answer I’ll give it to you. Rank 4 is the top rank possible after week 1. No one should hit rank 14 until week 13.
---
I saw online how to do it and happily went to solo him, horde didn't gank me. Good times and then the 4 wacko'a showed up and fucked my boii. Second attempt was with a group and one guy dies, Fordring keeps walking and he fails the escort, rip. 
---
How did you get past those guards solo? :o They completely wrecked my pet and me, even pre-trapping didn't work
---
im fun at parties too
---
Don't forget any dungeon usually takes 20% more whenever the group comes up with shortcuts and brilliant ways of skipping packs.
---
It means he is temporarily kicked out until Method can make an official investigation on the events and check if they violate any of the rules in their contract. If a violation is found, he will be punished accordingly (most likely permanently kicked) and if there is no violation, then he has the right to continue in Method.
---
Heh I'm the opposite.  Let the idiots duke it out for the next mage blade.  Meanwhile I'm picking up ToEP and volatile power robes cheap.
---
also if you're that amazing of a programmer to write THE BEST WOW BOT EVER CREATED 7001 then you probably have better shit to do idk
---
Well, i rarely seeh them for some reason ;)
---
No, that IS excessive.
---
I got stuck in a chimney in Silverpine in the farm north of Ambermill.
---
Yeah all those swimmers carpenters and photographers spending 18 hours a day alone practicing their hobbies.
---
They are both pretty dead so I thought I'd try my luck here as well
---
How can you cast bolts while you're busy finding it?

Can't be too large if you're using a random comment in a random thread to brag about your Details! optimization.

what nice!! can i have your addon list pls?
---
Survival was intended to be a profession to make things like torches and mobile camps, yes, though I concur that I also knew of the darker Duskwood, though can't remember if it was from the Kevin Jordan vid or just hearsay
---
What about Tarren Mill, it won't defend itself? Go get it, champion.
---
He managed to f it up after just two weeks. Nicely done!
---
Origin in Vashj EU? :p
---
Layering for dungeons *isn't* okay. In fact weren't layers for dungeons fixed much earlier when people were found to be abusing it?
---
IF however you're talking about people finishing an instance, then resetting it and running it again from scratch....that's not layering. They're putting in the same effort for each run (more or less) to achieve the same chances at loot.
---
If you're talking about layering as in one guy stationed at a boss, killing the boss, then switching to another layer while STAYING AT THE BOSS' LOCATION, then yes, that would be layering and it's an exploit. Either dungeon layering was removed earlier, or my memory is off and this is an exploit that IS punishable (I think. It is an exploit regardless and people are not okay with it).
---
1. Layer is used to reduce lag and large population by blizzard. If 100 people were in the starting zone they will have trouble trying to get mobs, with layers there is let’s say 4 layers with 25 people in each. Layer 1 can’t see layer 2, 3, and 4 people. 
---
2. BoE is binds in equip so something that is tradable
---
3. BoP is bind on pick up so something that is instantly bound to you when you receive it.
---
Yeah even Mograine had about 1k queue at 6.30 pm yesterday, so Gehennas is gonna be even worse
---
I am going to get slaughtered for the next couple weeks whilst I level up my last few levels, time to pay for dungeon runs I guess 😂
---
Lmao, only edgy kids watch him anyways, I mean I didn’t understand why Method hired him in the first place, he is just known because he was first 60 in the world, wow, apart from that he is a super average player to be politely.
---
When you try to be sarcastic but make the correct point.
---
DSM-5 clearly states that ninjaing items in a videogame is a telltale sign of sociopathy.
---
&gt;something small

---
Reminds me of when Fratley would make videos then shit talk guildies when shit talk people for failing in full groups. Those were the days.
---
Fucking hunters, always causing shit
---
I hope he had an alt called harmony
---
Considering it's their own engine, what's the difference?
---
It's not only op, it completely screws class balance. All of a sudden you can't sheep a Rogue. You can't balance idk WL vs Priest around shackle.
---
The streamer server will always have unique player behavior, but I don't necessarily disagree
---
Reset fight and kill the pet again.
---
Incorrect, my friend got banned from Ninjaing Dbw from ICC in a pug he ran.
---
The GM linked him back the chat, showing him stating the loot rules.
---
So back in the day, you did get banned for ninjaing.
---
&gt; if the tank isnt fear warded
---
Doesn't happen with 98% of all alliance priests actively abusing dwarves.
---
&gt; or stance dancing
---
Tanks that aren't doing this are either really bad or too used to dwarf abuse.
---
just look at how people treat hybrids here, on a 15 years old game which content is trivialized.
---
As a resto druid your survivability is based around mobility. You get away from the damage more than survive it, there are a couple of talents that let you do this, namely Nature's grasp for melee survivability and swiftmend for a non hard cast heal. Of course against a group this probably won't save you but very few people will survive against a group, especially as a level 50 versus 60s, you're basically boned in this scenario no matter what.
---
As for gold your best bet is dungeon farming, resto druid grinding is hella slow
---
To clarify: They shouldn't sign someone *just* because of their ingame achievements because of the risk of something like this happening. JokerD was always a wildcard, not exactly what you want to represent your org when you are trying to get legitimate sponsors
---
If your talking about instantly dieing, paladins can stack up reckoning charges (talent in protection tree), that lets them store up to 5 attacks.
---
That's what she said
---
Guy in the screenshot didn't even mention any specific names or rough timestamps. If I was the GM and saw such a ticket I couldn't be arsed to look into it, even if they'd resolve it usually.
---
Justice boner using so much skin that I don't have enough to close my eyelids anymore.
---
Just rerolled with some friends on Golemagg Eu last night as alliance, hope the hype will slow down when I hit 48+ :). I am craving for the stv pvp though. Still hope they will add bgs untill I hit 60.
---
Literally the 4th word of an one-sentence post, your comment alone is longer than my post, if you're not interested in the post just fuck off and don't waste everyone time by commenting mean and irrelevant things...
---
*does an instance run for items and gold*
---
*spends quadruple the gold earned for grenades, for the sweet genitalia boost of Details!*
---
Why they remove layering?
---
That works now, but not if you hit a raid that requires progression then ppl will earn 0 dkp while putting in a lot of effort.
---
&gt;  clueless
---
It's the biggest difference. Even now a run could easily take 5 hours if none of the group members know how to get where.

Not sure about drop rate. We had our first mc with no BoE after the surger changes.

Usally 3+ boe per a run

How? And where? Nobody is outside anymore
---
It is gunna be a mad house at first, I wouldn't expect it to settle for quite some time. Might want to stick to dungeon diving with groups and running as a group. If you plan on doing brd at all tomorrow log off inside.
---
Best piece of advice I can give you is to stock up on some free action potions pop them when you expect the gank, use natures grasp, and travel form away(or cat form dash away into stealth). If you aren't concerned about insta death which has been my experience with most (im not good) you can kite them in travel form and insta cast roots then dps a good bit.

Who is this?

Wtf... Any sauce ?
---
How about you study a little bit of French history ? We provided the biggest alpha males to humanity.
---
 Cheers for that!
---
I get the layering now, so for example completing a quest chain and another player hasn't, so you'd be on different layers in the quests location?
---
Ironic how people bashed layering for not following the Vanilla way, yet the moment it's gone, many are instantly complaining about overcrowding. Blizzard saw this coming a mile away.
---
Its sad how many (potentially) good memes get lost because of this stupid Rule 7

I expect twitch streamers to be twitch streamers. How come your feelings are hurt? I'm not even speaking about you

Don't. Guides tell it's super great for profit, but unless you have a guild that actively shoves formulas up your butt it's far from profitable. Also, I'm sick of all the loveless braindeads spamming trade chat advertising for their two formulas (crusader + x) every minute while not even bothering to collect others.

That makes you really lucky :)

something about european accents mixed with douchebaggery just makes it a million times worse
---
To be fair the people who streams games for a living, and done so as their entire adult career, don't tend to develop normal cooperative behaviour, in fact a lot of them seem to be rewarded by their own stream when behaving like manchildren
---
I posted in the previous megathread:
---
"When doing BRD pickpocket runs and you jump out of the window to reset combat, how do you get back in? Only way I have found so far is past incendious and that path takes longer than just doing a ghost run back to BRD."
---
I got the response:
---
" You can walk /jump on top of the thing/window. Use the casting circle of distract to more clearly see the terrain. "
---
I am now standing outside the window, where I have been trying to jump on top of the window for 10minutes. How on earth are you able to do that?
---
Hordes in this thread hahaha! Did someone steal your lunch money?
---
Like dining max lvl puts you to safe zone. When you get ganked 2 v 1 enemy would attack you because they seen some green crap gear crying out loud, that you are fresh lvl 60.
---
Not necessarily. Consider that growing up we had actual role models to lookup to. Kids these days don’t have even their parents to look up to so they rely on the internet for this.
---
As a priest you can chain mind vision from the side entrance to check both spawn locations.
---
Good plan! However I made a group with the guild and after 3 runs it finally dropped and they all passed it for me..
---
no more UBRS |:D
---
See, people must imagine there are little elves living in an old boot somewhere reading Blizzard Reports and holding grand jury on what action should take place. When, in reality, if Joker gets X amount of reports he gets a ban, there's nothing else to it.
---
Mad\_Maddin spelled it out as straight as it can be. Ele does some great DPS if the fights are around 30s, but anything longer will have you OOM. You could alleviate this with potions and runes, but those only wash so far.
---
Enh also runs into mana issues sooner or later, and will have to depend on their WF+white hits/Flurry. They do however bring improved WF &amp; Str totems, which usually means there's 1-2 spots for Enh shammies due to the added utility of those. You'll probably also have to drop Fire res and/or tremor totems when applicable.
---
Why do people use the term "piloting", just say play
---
being told im a basement dweller by some guy who posts about nintendo and kids movies

this is why i post, thank you

I thought it'd be funny too and wasted an hour running away from him until I reached Undercity.
---
He finally bugged out when I used the elevator.
---
He also failed the Kandy and Nova missions.
---
What is it with priests and warlocks? We had an international guild BBQ back during Vanilla, spawning a few days at a campground. Ended up with one of the priests getting pregnant of one of the warlocks...
---
If you don't care about balnazzar this is easily doable as hunter + mage. Currently doing a series where we duo most high lvl instances.
---
I mean, at least they stayed together, that's a plus I guess...
---
I had a RIFT guild dissolve back in the day because the guild leader's wife fucked two of the guild officers at a meetup and then bounced from all three of them, emptying the guild bank in the process. She was a stone cold bitch.
---
&gt; if you mess up your jump to get in the arena you will die
---
Are you saying those spectators will drop aggro if you jump down?
---
is there like a armory thing for classic ?
---
Why would they mooch off of anyone? Have you mooched off of anyone in WoW, or have you gotten the stuff you have by yourself? Are they incapable of making things happen themselves so they have to ask kids to do shit for them? Sounds alot like some brainwashing cult
---
Its not even BiS

Restorative potions will make locks and priests east kills
---
He had 1600 viewers yesterday. Yes, dead streamer.
---
While Hunter farming Maraudon it occurred to me that they could not have designed a better single player experience for Hunter if they tried. That, the bow quest, and DM:N are just an incredible package soloable content for that class. Very demanding and unforgiving and filled with constant opportunities to fail and, eventually, constant opportunities to succeed and improve.
---
Most people can't handle fame, evidently JokerD is one of those people
---
Im tanking lvl 60 dungeons and off tanking in mc and ony. Do I need to be prot?
---
It's not like method wasn't known in the americas, what a dumbass.
---
OP you have responded very well to the criticism in this thread. I'm not gonna beat a dead horse, the other posters got it covered. Go on and be the best warrior you can be
---
They are, but from what I've seen he talks more shit than any other streamer probably because he was completely and utterly irrelevant before world first 60
---
I dont think you know what whatsapp is
---
hey thats cool, care to share a link?
---
Same here, he even pulled 3 more mobs while spawning the others and just healed himself back to 100% after getting low, didnt attack one single mob and turned in my quest.
---
people saying that your dps will not be high enough forgot that you should add the WF proc your group get to your own dps while considering utility to the group.
---
same with nighfall (the main reason to have at least one enhancement shaman)
---
when it procs, all the casters get +15% dmg. their dps get a boost, but you are the reason for that.
---
spot granted in a raid is not a a matter of high dps number but overall utility. a good guild knows that with your WF totem and a nightfall in  hand, You are the reason of most dps dealed.
---

I wish we had a better leading figure in WoW than asmongold

Wouldnt be surprised if in a few years the WoW section is called Method: WoW as they sign up every single person, guild, pvp team, mdi team, etc.
---
I was able to do it from the first time as shadow even though it wasn't that perfect

https://youtu.be/YLE9Jupk5Qo

On guild runs these are always passed to the healer (for us at least), but pugs don't necessarily do the same. If you're healing you could try to ask kindly if they'd consider passing, but no real guarantees there.

Dude there was someone who advertised herself to get a mount link[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/350au6/girl_trades_sex_for_wow_mount/)
---
Pretty sure it’s TOC era Wotlk where every piece of gear looked the same
---
agreed. Though I would replace that with 'less questing greens'.
---
Nice how everyone is predicting his carreer.
---
We havent edited it yet. Only raw footage on my stream in Norwegian. :)
---
This is what i was wondering
---
Hell yeah!
---
Problem is going to be finding a group that will take you. 
---
You should be good for front half of BRD easy!  
---
Just watch out for dogs, they can smell your stealth ass!! 🤣
---
what do you mean lol no
---
Thank you for the tipps. I chose this path and I really don’t want to give up just because now it could get slow and painful. 
---
So I’m trying my best to find compromises now 
---
What about farming materials for crafting my bis gear or other pre raid stuff I need. Do I get everything in dungeons? Should I buy some things from the AH?
---
ah, ok well good luck then!
---
if there was no WOW, Duke nukim would have come out on time and actually been good :(
---
&gt; Some of us play to be the best in PvP
---
Some of us do that, spend a shit ton of gold to learn and re-learn engineering, spend another shit ton of gold for free action potions or whichever items their preferred tryhard guide told them to do, even picked their race only by racial abilities and then still fail all the way.
---
I like it. It's cute.
---
I dont entirely see a problem with this. They horde, others get upgrades and they drop down the rankings waiting for a specific piece. 
---
Eventually they get a talking to about their lack of dps and either bid on gear or get benched assuming your guild is willing to cut those not playing to best help the raid
---
Bigger issue I'd see is classes with limited upgrades like ferals hording and getting to  relatively uncontested bid on Band of Accuria, Drake Fang etc
---
So long as you're in the same party, you're on the same layer. However if you're not on the same party, there's no hard and fast rule for whether that guy would be on your layer. I have an IDEA of what you're talking about: You might be thinking of the death knight starting area.
---
There's nothing like the death knight situation in classic. The world doesn't change regardless of how you've progressed through a quest (there is no world altering quest).
---
An example here: I don't know how this goes alliance side, but IF I'M CORRECT, Onyxia can be exposed as part of a quest in Stormwind. She'll take on draconic form and make a speech, but everyone in Stormwind will be aware of this when it happens. They can also go and watch it happen as well. There's even a quest in Searing gorge where you're tricked by a dragon to do stuff for him and then he takes on Draconic form. Once he's done with his monologue, a short while later he'll reappear in his spot and you won't be able to take quests from him again (because you've exhausted his quests), meanwhile other players passing by the area can WATCH HIM take on Draconic form. When he's in his human form, anyone who hasn't done his quests can accept/complete them. Layering does not affect this at all.
---
So you essentially want an addon that adds 2 extra buttons or one extra action bar? I don't know if this exists - there's a TrinketWatch addon or something similar which adds in 2 buttons for the trinkets, but I am not sure those are interactive or just for showing cooldowns/availability. TellMeWhen can be set up to show CD/availability. If you want 2 clickable random extra buttons, I have no idea.
---
If I were 13, I’d pick the 18-25 age option. Honestly the fact that you’re siting demographic surveys is hilarious as hell
---
You're dueling bad players. A good mage will eat you alive without trinket. Sheep-&gt;Reset. 2x Block if you ever manage to get the advantage. They will run you oom.
---
dont know why
---
Are you able to do Marcos with different actions? Like I currently have a macro set with harm Target it will cast Max rank Mana burn, and if not it will cast fishing. That works fine but I tried to set a modifier of shift and where it would equip staff/fishing pole if shift was used depending on harm or not but pressing shift doesn't do anything.
---
Back when I did it the first time, there was a no-life shaman who waited behind the boss, himself disguised ofc, dispelling anyone who tried to talk to the boss. At some point he has to go and get a new disguise, but the escort took long enough for him to be back before you could end the quest. Fucking terrible design, fun for the shaman I guess.
---
Our goal is to 2man all current 5man content. Tried UBRS as well, but it kinda stopped at the first boss.. :o
---
Yeah reckoning is pretty funny, when they receive a critical strike it gives them a charge. It’s like shamans wind fury proc however it’s not a RNG on swing but from receiving crits.
---
They'd be breaking EU laws if they don't release this by the end of this year.
---
Found the salty server transfer dude that didn't fix anything but made two servers worse.
---
Hahaha fucking great
---
Tell the group that you need a moment to get aggro. This is especially important in places like Uldaman where every pack is 5-6 elites, no single pulls.
---
If the mage wants to snowcone the whole pack and get one shot after I only have 1 sunder on each mob; then it’s his own fault, and be sure to tell them that as they’re corpsewalking back
---
But seriously, tell the group to wait. You decide the pace of the dungeon as a tank.
---
Sounds extremely annoying for sure. I'd try to organize a ganking party if he set up camp there..
---
Happy cake day!
---
People eat dog, fact. Korea’s not poor, fact. You’re weirdly overly angry, fact.
---
A totem twisting enhance shaman should easily find raid spots and its a really fun play style so long as you're not totally focused on dps meters. You add so much to your group's damage.
---
It's a tough path but hopefully you enjoy it!
---
Things are pretty cheap on a lot of servers so buying off ah isn't unreasonable but farm what you can just to save some money
---
Wooow what a terrible human being. /s
---
if you are a paladin with reckoning, drop a blessing of sacrifice on the warrior next to you in pvp, every time the warrior gets crit, you get a reckoning charge :), excellent when the warrior is engaging a hunter or rogue that is critting so much that all the extra reck charges literally allow you to delete opponents :)
---
Wake up, wake up. It's the first of the month. So grab your check and come up.
---
The song Land of the Heartless off Eternal East 1999, I'd say is one of their gold standard songs. Another being Notorious Thugs and Handle the Vibe.
---
I'm good, how about you?
---
Mostly getting Shaman and warlock loot from every boss... was hoping onyxia was gonna be different but then 2 ten storms dropped
---
Just listen to Bone Thugs all the time and it's fine.
---
Ever heard of Anathema?
---
He'll probably need that mana though, otherwise it's pretty quickly over once he meets a priest/hunter. All Depends on the playstyle. In that gear I would go healer/dispeller support first and Reccbomber second. That should be perfectly fine. 
---
While that reccbomb won't delete anyone even with hand of Rag it will drop them fast to easily clean them up afterwards. If in doubt, switch to S&amp;B after using the reccbomb.
---
Yes, *suspended*, not *kicked/removed*. Give this some time, when it blows over he'll be back in full swing under Method colors :)
---
&gt;Senseless honor killings
---
wat  
---
It's not senseless if there are tangible rewards. Unless I don't understand the word to its full extent.
---
Just don’t join those then
---
Sorry I should have been clearer. 
---
Just a single target taunt, as I feel prot AoE toolkit and the amount of reflect damage they can do is enough to justify not having an AoE taunt. Giving them both I feel would not be considered a “small” change if we are working with OPs guidelines :p
---
Also I feel it works out with the classic style of why some classes have certain abilities, it would make sense not to give Paladins AoE taunt as they have better means to hold AoE threat. 
---
Here’s hoping classic+ might introduce some things :p
---
As suspected, turns out this guy is your garden variety basement dwelling sociopath. 
---
The crazy part is that he doesn't seem to understand the true consequences of his actions. He boasted that he "doesn't care about his reputation on a U.S. server", yet was streaming to the entire world, so it's completely irrelevant which server/region he's playing on. He literally just damaged his reputation on every server on the planet.
---
Also, this very much undermines his WoW Classic legacy, and compromises his place in Method. He could have just been that guy who got the world first 60, and went on represent Method. Now, he has relegated himself to that guy who ninja looted an item, and got suspended/fired from Method. What an absolute tool.
---
Thanks! That is it! :D
---
Should just earn currency for Bosskills.   
---
Put a Vendor at the start of the instance and maybe even a tab for each Boss.   
---
Once enough kills of a certain Boss are aquired you can buy one of his items. Fair, fun, still grindy.     
---
The entire randomness for raiddrops sucks in my opinion.    
---
We never had a T2 Priest set drop in our classic raids so far, we got shamans with full t1 and sell boe pieces in the ah while other classes didn't even aquire 3set t1.
---
Its so fucking good you can't change your name, all these pricks have to level a whole other character to be accepted back into raids
---
&gt; Because it's not a guild where the GM can kick you and go "lol fuck you", it's an organisation with which he has a legal contract. It's a job.
---
Where I come from, your boss can gkick you.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment
---
&gt;At-will employment is a term used in U.S. labor law for contractual relationships in which an employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason (that is, without having to establish "just cause" for termination), and without warning,[1] as long as the reason is not illegal (e.g. firing because of the employee's race or religion).

This. This is why I was confused.
---
I’d tell you to stop posting shitty memes and that you aren’t clever.
---
Several pickpocketing guides, but every single one shows that you can use the window to reset, does not show how to get back in. They just skip on to next 'trick'.
---
yea not a surprise
---
Clearly didn't look at the video and just assumed the content.
---
No
---
I'd say its quite balanced to be honest.
---
Wow you’re so cool pretending you don’t understand someones simple spelling mistake. You must be an absolute blast to hang out with 😑
---
I need to level from 53 to 60 inside BRD going Gor'Shak runs to escape ganks, but I can't escape ganks if I enter BRD. The paradox.
---
Probably why it's showing the entire thing instead of priest or priestess
---
Smite
---
It's a joke m80
---
But, isn't that how builds evolve?
---
You plug your numbers in you analyse your hit cap/crit/gear specs and try to get the best rotation and dps you can based on the optimal gear, right? Right pots, food buffs etc etc
---
Then the guides go up on Icy Veins and the majority of people go with those.
---
I personally don't watch anything on Twitch, nor do I follow people on YouTube because I would rather read a guide than watch someone talk about it.
---
Influencers seem like such an odd thing to me, but I'm old :D
---
Should happen, though. No mercy for assholes.
---
That ratio is waaaay off
---
In the Blizzard Activison earnings call for Q3 they said it would release in December, so hopefully then.

You can tell when someone changes their comment.

Maybe two but its hard to remember 3rd-5th grade.  
---
His statement applies equally to people buying basketball shoes well into their 20s.
---
mmmmmmm imagine getting kicked from lucrative video game team cause you ninjad an item in classic. no sympathy for someone that stupid.
---
wtf? you bought a lvl 60 char? wow, i did not know that people really do that AND are even genius enough to tell others about it.
---
For world bosses and the launch period is over.
---
Was that in Herod? I swear I saw a train of alliance players riding frostsaber mounts at a distance while I was leveling in Burning Steppes yesterday.
---
Sexist
---
Plus he was streaming to the world, so framing his statement about his reputation around one server/region is utterly moronic. He literally just ruined his reputation with every region/server/guild on the planet.
---
Oh No, it's Chris Hansen!!!
---
Consumables? Damn, too bad I'm cheap. Maybe I'll level alchemy on one of my guys for it. Have 2 manned most beginning instances while leveling ourselves(except gnomer we out leveled it and didn't bother with it afterwards) as a war+druid. 
---
But it's good to see that this may be something that we may be able to do.
---
No, that got introduced later, believe it was Burning Crusade or even Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Nope, came with TBC
---
Warlock - just give us little bit of shadowbolt hit% in our talents.
---
Earthshaker is a reallt good realm. 
---
Feel welcomed
---
Yes yes
---
\-Things people who didn't play Vanilla or read the Blizz forums back then, say.
---
had same problems in vanilla, changed who created the raid a few weeks and got other loot drops, no idea if it's that coincidence or not but heard alot did same with good outcome..
---
I think Power is the name of his guild.
---
Missed opportunity: Casualt
---
It's of course for those 14 week stretches where only leaf drops.
---
It's funny, literally the mention of p2 has gotten everyone together to start pvping, even before honor gives anything.  BRM has been a skeleton fest with guilds just duking it out back and forth all the way from thorium point to mc / brd entrances.  It's glorious and I love pvp servers.
---
Make sure to hotkey your shapeshift and cancleform macros so you this becomes second nature to you. Travelform, Renjuv, Natures Grasp ... Use the shapeshifts you do to get out of Frost Nova etc with some useful gcd.
---
Has DM Tribute farming for hunters been nerfed?
---
I tried yesterday and couldn't make the first jump onto the ledge after starting the instance. Even with no mob pressure, I simply could not jump onto the ledge anywhere
---
That is a fair metric if asking about PvE. But what about PvP?
---
Goddamit Dee
---
It’s crazy, you are absolutely right. But so many people already see me from far away, even though I use stealth. I never know why, because the ranges where they see me are ridiculous. I always get killed in neutral cities and get stunned before I can even change to bear form. 
---
When I get the chance. Even bear form can’t save you from lvl 60s and fleeing is hard when they only need 1-3 hits. 
---
Of course it’s even harder since I switched from feral to resto 
---
I don’t have anything against a fair pvp fight, it’s so much fun even if I lose. My problem are ganking and camping lvl 60 rouges and lvl 60 groups and how to avoid the areas (or flee from unfair fights) where they camp and still be able to level. I already found a solution for not using the ships :D
---
LC works if the ppl distributing loot is fairminded people. Fortunetly it doesn't take long to figure whether they are or not.
---
There really are 3-4 devs on the Classic team huh
---
Just did almost entirety of Un´Goro last night. Not one gank.
---
thing is, most raids dont have many WL/Shamans/Druids... we use to run 4 warlocks but there were almost always 8 mages and likewise amount of rogues, priests, warriors.  
---
Otherwise you are just unlucky.
---
Most of the time druids are off tank. So you got plenty of time to build threat. When main ranking. Yes you Need the hit. If your guild wants you te be you should get the hit ring asap
---
That must not've been working properly then, I've been defended at neutral standing. Unless being in town is different than out and about.
---
OOF
---
&gt; between STV and Ashenvale
---
🤔
---
Let’s be honest he’s too stupid to have done anything productive with his life
---
Isn't T1 belt better for priests anyway? If it's not BiS for one class specifically, let them all roll.
---
Agreed. It's just like with a sports game: you shouldn't lose your job for cheating in a sports game, unless playing sports is your job...
---
I prefer my shaman. If we all die I can get up again every 40 minutes and revive people.

Had this happen once. we calmly explained that's not how it is done usually. He really thought otherwise but once he saw everyone else in the party disagreed with his roll, he stopped needing on it. honest mistake. Why is this even tagged with Humor.

Take a look from the opposite side. You don't have kids that you didn't plan, with the wife you didn't want. Dog is nice tho! :)

I'm using an english client and I don't have that bug.

Yeah a lot of weirder content is really done well. Like two manning DM East. Really fun. And perfect for a shaman.
---
Take upvote 400 you peasant and get out of my sight
---
i dont care
---
Cool
---
This is a pretty stupid question but I'm hoping someone can help me with it. 
---
Simply put, I don't want to be a Priest, but I like the toolkit Priests get, specifically things like their HoT Renew, and their panic button in Power Word: Shield. I also like them for the aesthetics, I like the Priest kind of archetype. 
---
But, I hate shadow magic, it ruins the class for me because I can't enjoy it. It's too dark for the way I play and image myself in the world, and despite my best attempt to get past it I just couldn't. 
---
So, simple question, Druid, Shaman, or Paladin to capture what I want with the Priest?  
---
On a closing note - I won't just not-use-shadow-magic on the Priest. I have tried but I just can't get past removing an entire part of my toolkit just because I don't like it.
---
Obiviously some, but i feel it's wrong to measure popularity on vod views
---
Nice that was my plan anyways! I shall do that then :) thanks
---
I never liked him and never will was my opinion before this happened soo... yeah. Dudes got such an ego but for what? Thousands of hours on a 15 year old game and good at aoe farming to 60? Like good on ya but that won't do anything for your damaged mentality.. grow up kid.
---
Here's another little tip: Install the addon Puggle. It will scan the LookingForGroup channel and present the LFG/LFM's in a nice list, grouped by instance for you so you get a quick overview and decrease the chance you miss someone. You're welcome :D
---
yeah weird that a server that was bought online long after launch and communities had established isn't getting a large amount of traffic ... use your brains please people.
---
Right, but the reason they used layers instead of having more servers is because they thought a significant number of people *would* leave and they'd be able to remove the layers and still have a full server that wouldn't be overpopulated.  (As opposed to not having layers where if a significant number of people left they'd have a large number of dead servers).
---
&gt;  all I want is the Burst of Knowledge trinket
---
Honestly as a shadow priest you are better off grinding briar + mindcap or 2x mindcap.
---
Ok thanks. Probably that‘s why this is still not fixed, I guess no dev is annoyed by this because they all use the english client...
---
Millionaires have rooms distant enough to talk without waking each other up though.
---
Don't mind me. I obviously meant Stonetalon, not STV. Proofread your posts!
---
I feel like I'm a slow player, but most of these are pretty much spot on for me (well, I'm still way closer to the right statement than to the left of course).
---
I guess I just look at it as what's more replaceable next tier.  You'll use TOEP longer than mageblade, hypothetically.  Also TOEP is just infinitely more fun in pvp.
---
There is a way to change your name; have lots of people report your name. Works like a charm.
---
Barrens chat, always a treat
---
Probably more dungeons.
---
It's like we killed janitors in our sleep or something and have 19 keys.

BIS gear lists determining what you MUST have. In Vanilla I was a rogue in a Naxx raiding guild and had never heard of HoJ (or if I had, certainly didn’t have it/ had never farmed it). Now as a rogue in a raiding guild HoJ is my p2 BIS so I “have to” keep farming Anger, and 30+ runs later I hate that it is a thing. Same with Bracers of the Eclipse out of DM:W (in Vanilla I was happy with Nightslayer/Bloodfang) and Cape of the Black Baron. 
---
In Vanilla we were much more flexible with how we chose to maximize our stats and more open to multiple ways of doing things. In Classic we all look like clones and people are snootier about BiS.
---
U mean 85% of the playerbase metagames and follow their best BiS lists? Surprising.
---
Looking forward to it! Already seen plenty of action. I'm lvl 56 so prime time.

Only place I'll really be avoiding is Thorium Point.

Yeh im all about adding power to comments, OMEGALUL

Yeah that isn’t near as scummy. As long as they are up front about it, it isn’t unethical. If you need the item, don’t join. The run will be filled with others that don’t need the item.

Yeah its something we as officers are going to have a meeting on. But it seemed to cause a HUGE fight lol. Ty for the reply.
---

---
That's children... If I live with my boyfriend I'm not a child hopefully
---
Ha we had the same thing, did split raids for Ony and DE 2/4 of the heads that dropped. Our Druids are looking like their treey selves, Shamans 8/8 and Warlocks don't even want Felheart anyway.
---
Justice is sweet

I tried that a couple days ago and it didn't work. It wouldn't let me restore until I deleted the new same name character.

This is no different to VAC. Botting or hacking is treated the same. Banning in waves stops hackers knowing which hacks triggered VAC. In this case it would be what aspect of the bottling software was compromised.

AMA request
---
I just want to know why they called this 'layering' this time? IIRC wasn't it called 'phasing?'
---
He is part of the organisation method but they don't even have a classic guild, the actual method raider only play retail.
---
Holy shit could this guy be any more creepy. And Method still work with him? Wow
---
I’m bird.
---
you see, thats a problem with hybrid classes. Most of them are fucking nuts with mana problems
---
My wife's guild in tbc was very similar.
---
It was an all girl guild with a couple white knights / boyfriend's thrown in. One primary member slept with at least 3 of the guys in the guild. I'm talking distances from Florida to California
---
My wife (gf at the time) found a rogue "friend". Keep in mind at during this time I was raiding about 20hours a week in a different guild. Anyway, this rogue friend of hers either didn't realize that she was taken or just didn't care and bought her a 1 way ticket to aneheim and a pass to blizzcon for the year. Of course he wanted to smash..
---
Shit was the wild west back then.
---
No no no. Going from for loop to 2.5k lines of API is going in the opposite direction. The fact that you think the answer is to write code at all is what I mean by “little to no ability to articulate practical software concepts.” 
---
Regardless, he’s right.  It’s not called mirroring, it’s called “key broadcasting,” and it indeed involves catching inputs and sending them to the other processes you specify.
---
However, his original argument is completely false—whether you call it mirroring or key broadcast, it’s completely within TOS and is not the sort of automation that is illegal. 
---
Good luck in school. Sorry for being a dick. We all start somewhere.
---
Sounds like you want a Paladin. I respect the dedication to your class fantasy and that's a totally valid reason to back out of a class.
---
We're getting A LOT of Druid loot. Very annoying since we only have two Druids.  
---
Also I don't understand how streamers like Asmongold get multiple Eyes AND Bindings. We have seen neither drop once....
---
well i guess you're on some shitty ass pve server so i can see why you think that would happen
---
Try to disable her stealth ability. That helped me.
---
You know that heart was pounding at least 120bpm and his hands were shaking from the adrenaline of that quick steal lol
---
I’m not sure if you’re trying to dispute what I said here, or re-enforce it, but you’re just repeating what I said?
---
There must be some mental issues like depression or similar which is making him unable to take the consequences into consideration or just not caring about them.   
---
Obviously his team would care if he ninjas an item and obviously it would get on Reddit so every server knows. Even a 11 year old would understand that.   
---
 We will probably see him streaming less now I believe.
---
I was in IF recently and i had a dwarf priest just follow me and spam /thirsty for 3 minutes straight. Never whispered me or said anything. Eventually he /ty and went away after giving up.
---
Is it really so hard to properly talk to players and not just spam them with stuff like that?
---
Felt pretty degrading to be honest.
---
In other news, water is wet, and the sun is in fact hot.
---
“Only”
---
I just realized their hair is not wet
---
Completely turning the tides with a lvl-up is one of my favourite moments too!
---
Sounds reasonable. Too bad this subreddit is not filled with reasonable people
---
I'd say it is 55/45 in favor of Horde. As close to 50/50 as one can reasonably expect on a a PvP server.
---
🎶 Forever in two jeans, yeeeeeah! 🎶
---
10% drop rate for an item all holy priests want as well, while this staff is up for grabs? Might as well use this for months before you can get your anathema.
---
TIL
---
Was doing a full BRD with some guildies last night. Had a level 56 druid tank. The rest of us were 60.
---
Warlock ended up tanking most of the dungeon, haha.
---
Tier tokens became a thing in aq40 and naxx actually.
---
he already got fired from method. I think the predictions were spot on.
---
This is the moment where I like being a rogue
---
That’s a good idea.  Stay in the dungeons
---
Interestingly, even when horde are objectively worse, they are still way more popular. Perception is king in arena to get the opener and in wrath I would argue that gnome is better overall than undead.
---
Oh nice! I didn't make it past Bwl back in the day before TBC dropped so I missed that.
---
???
---
Obviously it's not acceptable, as already acknowledged by /u/DewRat .
---
The thing we are saying is it's not as easy as some people make it out to be. And the answer certainly is not "reduce anti cheat", whatever you might or might not mean by that, lol.
---
Instances and layers are fundamentally different. There is a reason blizzard started banning people who were abusing layering inside instances.
---
* Instances allow a group to complete strictly PVE content in a controlled way(limited players) to maintain content difficulty/reward.
---
* Instance loot is adjusted to accommodate multiple groups farming at once so that the server isnt flooded with epics/fat loots. Notice that even at the end of p1 seeing the dreadsteed from Strath is quite rare yet within 30 days the AH and evil hoarders' banks were full of black lotus, arcane crystals, limited recipes from world vendors..
---
* Instances are completely optional content. many players only step into a hand full of dungeon groups while leveling and dont see entire dungeons during their experience. WE ALL log into the overworld and were FORCED into layers that prevented PVP content and allowed for the economy to get manipulated so that some people have 7k gold right now and are geared and decked with all gold can buy, while even others who leveled within the first 2 months cant afford the lv60 mount.
---
Wow now I feel super unlucky, damn fordrings
---
Hell of a life to live.
---
This is the first week ive raid logged... i need something else to do besides level a third character.
---
Out of the loop here, what did he do?
---
It might be that mob grinding in some remote, unvisited location might be the most efficient xp/hour - not sure why LBRS/UBRS would be less susceptible to ganks than BRD, as anyone who camps BRM could camp both. 58 and up for UBRS anyhow. It's not a bad idea to do those dungeons, but it might be more likely you'll run into problems when entering/resetting those dungeons.
---
Back in the day we solved that with a fixed decay, for example 20 DKP, that became the attendance bonus. 
---
That gave attending raiders an incentive to spend effort on progression. While those that didnt join progression raids would fall behind on the race to the Big ticket items. 
---
To be honest, i dont see anything outside Naxx and late AQ to pose such a Challenge that 0sum will not be a very viable alternative. 
---
Could also be solved by not having it be a 0sum system, by rewarding progression by giving out first-kill bonuses.
---
You need a friend to make a char with your name. You don't do it yourself
---
Three staffs, two blades with fewer clears than that.
---
Very funny. Post about your divorce in a few months, now that'll be hilarious.
---
Mind flay is shadow damage. And smite can crit...
---
You understand that there can be hundreds or thousands of people on just 1 IP?
---
This is literally what sexism means...
---
Ah, witch hunts are fun.
---
man, that's a good troll.
---
Idk If I'm a noob but I've literally never seen anyone on those signs to the left  
---
thats pretty bad ass if you ask me
---
I actually respect him for looting. Really shows that he isnt a sellout unlike the rest of method.
---
As a prof warrior, I’m so fucked :(
---
There seem to be some bug in teh game, Asmond could tag elite mobs in Hinterlands and have his army kill it, he got over 300k exp/hour that way.
---
I believe it only works if someone else takes the name. So ask a guildie to create a character with your name.
---
Wow these are big words for stealing pixel staff, based on online persona.
---
Thanks. Good to know
---
But that don't say anything, if the item hv a 1% chance or 50% it still can happen that way. There are chances that the 1% drop item drop more often then the 50% item in that time.
---
It's one thing to not care about your own rep, but I think he forgot that whenever he streams, he represents method as well
---
Pretty sure method didn't officially try to participate in world first 60 so yeah
---
Seeing all the consumables needed just to make it through basic trash I'll never take my priest/mage comp for granted again
---
That rank 14 status isn’t going to earn itself, son!
---
Our guilds 3 staff dropped yesterday. 3 week in a row also. No mageblade tho.
---
This is so much worse than you think it is.
---
Have a human rogue that is named "Notrouge" after seeing it spelled that way so many times.
---
Level 58 PvP gear will be available. No worries! You can join in on the fun and keep grabbing hella lit honor points for great set pieces in a few weeks.
---
You need a second account or a friend that uses the name. It can't the on the same account
---
Asmongold is a streamer asshole, but is he really arrogant if he knows he's a streamer asshole?
---
Classic:
---
I have a list 24 (at the moment) of tried and test players that I know are 8/10-10/10 at there class and trust to not get BoE rage when a world drop occurs. 
---
Same list of 24 people ask me for help or if I want to come alt raid with them if they need a spot filled for a dungeon. 
---
Guild I am in has standards and if you act like an ass hat you get show the door. 
---
People in guild respect each others time and make an effort to communicate there absence and/or being late and no one gets upset. 
---
An upgrade is very much an upgrade and there is no hopes to RNG Jesus that the affixes work in my favor. 
---
I dont have to log in every single day (or feel like I have to) if I dont feel like grinding AP.  Once I have consumables set for the raid, if its not a coordinated run for world buffs, I can use my time to do what ever else I want to do. 
---
Retail:
---
Im a name on a LFG board hoping to be picked for a spot in a pug that may or may not down a boss. 
---
Being in a guild may as well be a gym member ship that I paid for but dont use.   Very few folks are actively on outside of raid. 
---
Most dont care to talk/socialize unless its for there benefit (they need something). 
---
If I get a drop that is 10ivls diff it may not be as good as that old item due to affixes and folks still get on you for your ilvl being 3 points short of there desired magic number.  Even though your output is enough to be at middle of the charts for the dps. 
---
QOL changes are nice but I really did miss having to put effort into prepping for raid and or having consumables at the ready.
---
Want to hit this ranch brotendo?
---
Not really even close imo.
---
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🙈🙈🙈👌👌👌😩😩😩🍑🍑🍑🍆🍆🍆💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯😎😎😎
---
Never heard of the girl who gave buttsecks for an epic flying mount via craigslist?
---
Actually smart.
---
Same tbh, it's almost as if someone working in a shop told a customer to go fuck themselves unprovoked. It's going to be fun to see the shit show after the decision as well!
---
Yeah cause rolling again 39 other people for something you'll see once a month is really good odds
---
I believe the higher the damage the higher the chance to break fear.
---
i love you low key saying, several times, that Classic will be dead in a year. You probably were one of those saying it would be dead in weeks at release as well right? lol
---
Misspelling =/= mispronouncing
---
Speaking of failing, those are two differently distinct things things.
---
Spelling is written or typed while pronunciation is spoken or verbal.
---
Victim mentality at it's finest.
---
Gehennas have decently long queues between 4 pm to 10 pm, peaking at about 7 pm where there might be a 3 hour queue. If you struggle with queues you can easily set up Chromecast to queue from work or school/on your way home. Queues really only are an issue if you make them an issue yourself.
---
But
---
Ninja=Lying
---
Lying=Scamming
---
Which would mean that ninja is scam.
---
As of WoD expansion and earlier, if you specified the loot rules, Blizzard would take action. I don't know about after Legion but it's almost impossible to ninja in current wow which means blizzard probably doesn't have that support anymore
---
You timed quite right to start classic right now. Have Fun leveling through while wpvp comes down :D
---
Ice barrier look fine on gnomes. Source: I'm a gnome mage
---
Yeah I was watching a lot the first month he hit 60 and he was very fair with loot and even gave it away a few times when he won the roll.
---
No, he was right. Layering was the solution invented to avoid servers depopulating after the tourists were done. It was great design, as long as their premise was correct that most people would leave.
---
PvP? Waste of points, there's better stuff to get. Typically retro doesn't even go past 10 points in Holy.
---
Why bother counting on your luck to have a 1 in 10 fear resist when you can bring a Glimmering Mithril Insignia or Shadow Reflector and resist/counter fears with 100% certainty?
---
Do people like these have any friends though?
---
*surprised Pikachu face*
---
They *try* to start those runs. Which is why you see them spamming all the time.
---
Imagine being this much of a virgin loser you cry over pixels xD
---
This!
---
If all I want to do is grind mobs for cloth, them log out I can!
---
Vs 
---
Must do 15-20 dailies for them loots! Cuz possible upgrade!
---
I think it's they got rid of that support system when current WoW got rid of it.
---
dw, this publicity will get him tons new viewers. drama sells
---
It can be faster if you are good at clearing the dungeon fast. What you need to do is get 3 other people around your alts level and run them too. WOW uses an average level to determine EXP. Having 3 other low levels will lower the average level, thus giving you more EXP. You also get a group exp bonus.
---
Someone is divorcing lolz.
---
GM's are very different in what they will or will not handle.
---
The gatherer add-on (or gathermate, I can't remember the name) keeps track of schools you've found previously and puts a marker on the mini map.
---
But it won't show you what is there now - that's not available afaik
---
I am a druid and i did get 1 piece in 2 Months of MC running (only heal druid). Missed a guild run went random got 5x t1 ...weird
---
Being ironic. Sorry. My true haha’s are “lol” “rofl” and other such letter combinations. Ha ha ha or he he he is my way of expressing the “this is fine” dog in the burning house.
---
From how terribly he handles his stream I'd assume he doesn't care about sponsorship or money in general. Or at least has no idea how to make it
---
Try having a different person start the raid for their raid ID. Might change it up a bit
---
Thats a dumb reason tbh. Do they also allow rogues and warriors to roll on the mageblade then? Could be a damage upgrade for them.
---
Theres a bot that continuously grinds in azshara on my server (arugal), a warlock named snicks. Every day he posts Golden Pearl's on the ah. Every now and again I go down there and mess with its farm, tagging the mobs as it dots them. Just wish itd get banned already.
---
&gt; You mention playing a rogue but I would avoid that if you intend on doing any PvE content at endgame.   Ranged DPS are generally preferred 
---
You are so wrong. Rogues and warriors are as of now the strongest dps classes in the game, both in consistency and burst. Mages and locks will not keep up until Naxx. There is legit no endgame content where you need x amount of ranged and x amount of melee. Actually the more SemiHC and Hardcore guilds that "prefer" specific classes prefer more rogues and warriors then casters at this point. 
---
The reason you might have harder time getting dungeon grps is the simple fact that rogues share their BIS gear with warriors and hunters (enha shamans on horde), people simply dont want to share their gear when they make a group. Its not because mages are better in dungeons. The same will happen if a mage makes a group for lets say Scholomance for Witchblade. 
---
The only time a mage is preferred over a rogue is doing dungeons while lvling, due to the spellcleave bonanza that have risen.  
---
Also, if you are looking to get well geared and like to raid. You will have such a hard time as a mage compared to rogues. Phase 2 BIS gear for mages is blues, 6 epics and 4 tier pieces (3x tier 1 and tier 2 legs). The 6 epics all caster classes want, you will not get that fast if you will ever get it. The few tier pieces are so good that every single mage in your raid/guild wants them. So they will use all their DKP or loot prio to get those. Rogues on the other hand, their BIS gear is legit the Tier sets, which they only share with ROGUES. All rogues are interested in the tier pieces and all the rogue gear will be distributed evenly among the raid/guild. Since all the gear is in demand.
---
Also, if you are interested in PVP. Mage PVE and PVP bis is totally different, while rogue PVP bis, guess what. ITS TIER SETS.
---
You are asking the right questions. You could replicate this to a certain extent if all members in your guild have an addon that takes care of this, but it would never work quite as well as it does on retail.
---
On the other hand, time spent looking for the buff should be included in the clear time. What's the point of doing a super fast run you have prepared for just as long.
---
&gt;No, it sounds like a response to your post
---
I understand user names are hard...
---
I didn't do the original post.
---
Also, you might not have liked the question, but there weren't any disparaging remarks about the game or anything. Nothing in the post required that level of douchebaggery.
---
The SC2 analogy cracked me up.  SC2 pros could complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty while cooking dinner at the same time, it's literally not even comparable.
---
Back in 2005, my raid changed raid leaders every week. It so happened that certain raid leaders (as in: the one who invites) would get certain loot. Might be we had a weird randomness, but we would start an ID, check if the first 2 dropped what we expected, then sell the rest of the loot in IF chat - to great success.
---
I figure if you don't like it, make your own group where everyone gets to roll against you. I'm more than happy letting someone reserve an item if they go to the effort of putting the group together so I can even run it at all. Not selfish.
---
Not that I know of.
---
Spy is the only one I recommend. Some people call it cheating. Who knows, but it's very handy.
---
boo hoo you missed out on an item that drops every single run oh nooooooooooooooo blizzard pls help this man and give him restitution
---
Voidwalker&gt;sacrifice, congrats you won
---
Imagine if Blizzard fixed bugs
---
And who, exactly, does this negatively affect? 
---
I guarantee the time invested to level the characters significantly reduces the spam, and there is still zero negative impact
---
So the first patch will be after P6?
---
I'm not sure whether it works for yell and say. I believe not since it would make no sense and is complicating things since you gotta be near to each other. I'm no raid lead so I don't the exact name. Try  searching for autoinvite addon on twitch mods.
---
Many League players turned to streaming in this exact same manner. Dyrus is probably well known over multiple games as he played Dota, OW and a bunch of other famous titles. Pretty chill guy, too.
---
I mean, yeah.  Although if you're a professional streamer and supporting your parents on top of that, you do what you gotta do.
---
lul
---
I'm glad to see you take it seriously. Wish you luck going forward.
---
So you don't think the ppl who spend up to multiple weeks of attempts to clear new content should have an advantage over gear against ppl who just sit out and join in when content is on farm?
---
why are you so salty? is it because of your UK teeth? 
---
have you ever thought about why 90% of your comments are downvoted? probably because nobody likes you, except your obese teenager friends in a keyboard subreddit lmaooo
---
This is exactly what it was. People treat GMs like they are morons. "Maybe if I say these magic words I'll get what I want".
---
Hilarious!
---
Nevermore!
---
Funny, i have a wife, Kids and a dog because of Wow!
---
I would be a loser without it
---
I don't know, I'm just quoting what my atlas loot is telling me.
---
Morgraine is good as well and also basically 50/50 horde/alliance.
---
think we just got our 4th leaf only 1 eye. before guild raids I saw 2 leaf 1 eye.
---
If you got slaughtered yday you gonna get slaughtered today too.
---
Uh, I'm guessing you didn't do Lich King in WotLK?  Because one guy messing up defile would wipe the whole raid.
---
Yeah I'd be more interested if they looked better. Unique sure, but that's not enough for me to justify the mind numbing grind.
---
Cheers boss one last question, can I play as soon as I start download like retail or do I have to download the full 5 gig first ? I'm feeling the hype
---
Have you heard of Greater arcane protection potions?
---
Who really cares? 
---
Dude needs to grow some better facial hair though for sure. Looks like a 6th grade getting some new stubble or something.
---
only 1 blade for us
---
Well a sport does require competition. So while it is entertainment, as you say, it isn't necessarily a sport (esport)
---
I don't play WoW , but wanna know what the fuck this title is saying
---
Lock/Rogue/Druid here, not complaining, I'm a rogue lol
---
had a rogue called sapthat ninja a skullflame shield and has hasn't been on in maybe 2 weeks. server straight up blacklisted him from everything so he probably quit.
---
That's a good idea, thanks! Which ones should I go at 56?
---
Yeah it'll take 'literally' a couple more hours tops.. and mob spawns are way less contested now regardless.
---
Shoulders, Bracers, Gloves, Boots.  The rest is trash imo.
---
It's not even something that impresses most WoW players lol
---
Yeaah but my OCD tells me to be part of the bogger faction and I know that alliance is maybe 1 to 2 percent in favour. I think I'll stay at mograine and tell my ocd to frick off.
---
I want to level an alt as tank, but I dont really like warriors. As a paladin, would I have any difficiulties tanking dungeons(holding aggro)?
---
I feel so bad for all the warriors. Before it was hard to not pull random mobs as soon as there was a Warrior in your group and you had to help your poor warrior through the dungeons. 
---
Now they are open field targets :D 
---
But you’ll get through it!!!
---
You're correct.
---
These are fine. Not scummy at all. Just don't join them.
---

---
I believe you have to download at least a part of the 5 gigs to play. Not sure about the amount, maybe 2 to 3 gigs? You should be fine to play within half an hour I guess.
---
Thank you! I thought I didn’t have beta access as no email either but I have it.
---
While lvling as BM i would used the pet stun for saving the healer. 
---
The let growl did jack shit to save the healer 🤣
---
I just hit 50 last night and made my way to Feralas/Un'Goro. Glad that I'm done with Searing Gorge, but can't say that I'm looking forward to Winterspring.
---
Yeah except this is about Classic WoW and method got stomped in the race to 60, and first boss kills in Classic.  I don't care what they did in retail because that isn't relevant.
---
Nah, it's like that when you're too far away from the priest doing the quest, because your client does not know whether or not it is a male or female priest.
---
that is disgusting.
---
Yes it does. If you go to your chat settings it will by default show you the LookingForGroup Channel as well as local defense etc.
---
It doesn't however tell you how to join them or type in them or teach you about custom channels (like world or lfg)
---
The new class rouges added in phase 2 will make your enemy see red.
---
There should be a spawn window, just because it can spawn doesnt mean it has, it could be but probably wont be up right away
---
Do you mean ozium?
---
Yup!
---
Concussive shoot FTW!  Give the healer 2-3 sec to run to the tanks.
---
NVM you don't get the point, it's not a post uninviting males, simply a reason, why I want a female friend. No way did I hate on men, simply stated never works out "in my experience"
---
Oh you poor thing, that ain't helping you
---
I seriously hope that isn’t their mentality haha.
---
dear diary
---
Well the guild I was in literally died last Sunday during the raid because a Mageblade dropped during bad times with drama and our DKP system. I think that was more expensive!
---
Yikes rip
---
Your main issue will be having to drink after every pull as you burn through all your mama. Threat won't be a huge issue as long as there isn't an aggro dump (which there are some), in which case you better hope you have an offtank since you won't be able to reaggro.
---
Ty
---
Did he cost wow tos, or was he just a piece of shit?
---
I really love the design of Tier 2. Besides a few exceptions, most of them are so iconic and just fit the theme of the class perfectly. Ten Storms, Stromrage, Judgement, Dragonstalker, Bloodfang,... Who needs transmog if your raidgear looks like this?
---
Too bad AQ sets really looked like crap and imho Tier 3 was mostly not as great as T2 too
---
Would correct only one thing from “an issue” to “ your issue” 🤣
---
So I subbed to that discord and over the last few days they've only talked about things barely off meta (elemental shaman being by far the most discussed). And even there I can't find melee priest discussions
---
"In the settings" doesn't really count as broadcasting imo ;)
---
But yeah, it *is* possible to find it if you for some reason open the chat settings.
---
26 percent drop rate does not really mean much since its a raid drop. Possibly with many contestants and only one raid per week makes it a difficult item to acquire. I have only seen it drop once since week 3.
---
Yea i hope they do it and wait awhile before they release bwl.
---
\*Confused Rogue Noises\*
---
I can only refer to retail on this matter. I camped houlon for days and also past server reset. He didn't spawn instantly, so I guess server restart is not seen as the a countdown to spawn time. Might be wrong tho.
---
A lot of steamer would be loser in irl. Most of them if not all of them don’t have a education
---
It sounds like you need a game with daily Quests...
---
Yeah I know I was kidding :)
---
In C#, int? compiles to a nullable integer.
---
Which higher level bosses are soloable as a rogue? I saw a video of someone soloing Mara Princess as a rogue, but the video is from 2018 and I haven't seen anything similar since. Any info on this, or some BRD/BRS/DM bosses that rogues can solo?
---
I'm pretty sure in tbc/wotlk there were a ton of suspensions being handed out/items removed from people ninja looting shit. I feel like it's mostly based on what GM you get tho.
---
If you state loot rules in a pug those should be the rules, Otherwise master looters by default have everything reserved. So even then you wouldn't be protected from guild groups that got their 3 IRL friends on loot council.
---
Is there a subreddit for player/guild recruitment specifically for Classic?
---
Again you are just assuming things. Im just telling people here are overreacting. There are a lot of streamers who do this.
---
This is the exact reason less realms and more layering was the answer and people still bitched about it. Dead realms are far worse than temporary layers.
---
This.
---
maraudon and diremaul will have rogues camping there 24/7, most zones would not be populated for now since most streamers will be leading a raid team doing big world pvp.
---
most pvp actions should happen around the entrance to maraudon,diremaul, scarlet monastery or zulfarrak due to leveling and gold making from other people.
---
BRD will be fucked.
---
Streamers will most likely dictate where everyone will go, since they lead a bunch of people and people from both factions wants easily accessible pvp
---
My server has a guy who ninja'd Bindings and then a felheart belt "because the lock didn't deserve it". 
---
Everyone knows him now.
---
&gt; There are a lot of streamers who do this.
---
Does that make it okay?
---
You can probably play it on your car keys at that point
---
You played wow for 13 years but your bf is in high school? Yikes.
---
it took me a couple of reads an even so I had to read the post to find out the order of those words.
---
Holy shit that screenshot is depressing

What exactly is "ninjaing"? I understand it's when someone gets loot in an unfair way but I'm wondering how it can happen? Don't we always get to roll on items ("need or greed") when looting them in a party?
---
Is ninjaing rolling "need" when you should have rolled "greed" or is there some kind of a hack involved or?
---
Deserved it, watched the vod and damn is this guy an entitled douche.
---
Things he said about other players or him making "big bank" is horrible
---
Well not simply this. It has a lot to do with some people wanting it and others not.
---
No no no no, you only stay if your fire resistance is high enough to tank the flames. That tank clearly did not have enough fire resistance and so should have backed away like everyone else.
---
I never thought that it would start to get awful 3 days before, even one day before removing layering. After removing the layering it was hell at one evening. I was so frustrated I went to bed angry.... to realize that I really got affected by a video game so much. Since then I try to find tricks around it and try to stay positive and believe in reaching my goal of getting to 60 and raiding for the first time in my life. So I’m really thankful for every Tipp and all of you people helping me to feel more save again.
---
haha get fucked

Yep

Good one, enjoy being a fat virgin playing pubg and wow classic while I'm smashing life and making bank. I recently bought a keyboard for $1400 just because I can, you've probably never even owned that much money in your life lmaoooooo putting lmao really reinforces my point doesn't it?? Wow I'm so cool

Well he made a huge pigs ear of the last time he was there so I wouldn’t put it past him.

No, unless they changed it less than 12 hours ago. I did it yesterday.
---
You people take this way too serious. As for the name, I made that a long time ago when I actually used to stream.
---
Even with bigger numbers on the Alliance side, we had the exact same issues. Most people wanted to pug with us until their freinds’ guild’s raids started in December. So after getting enough pugs to join the guild by giving them priority to raid invites, we made it guild only last week.
---
My guildie won this but 16 people rolled. 25% drop rate means you'll see it on average 1/4 runs (once per month) and if 16 roll then you have a 6.25% chance to get this item every month.
---
That's one way to do it, but in raids there's most often a loot master who has control of distributing the loot according to peoples' DKP bids or peoples' rolls, depending on the policy. The loot master is often the raid leader, or a raid assistant/guild officer. If that person doesn't follow the praxis but loots the items to himself (or arguably a friend/guildie who loses the roll), that's considered ninja looting. If it conflicts with the raid-established loot rules it's a reportable, and bannable, offense.
---
We had one in BC as our guild had too many members for one so we ended with 2 guilds. One for mains and another for alts.  Both had linked chat and you cld join with any char if you choose and see the feed.
---
I have zero recollection to the name of it though as we only had it for a short while till blizz upped the max guild members and we cld fit all into a single guild
---
How are you resetting the fight with a fistfull of dots ticking?
---
Drops roughly once a month, it's not class bound so you're rolling against 7 to 14 others, reasonably... Just spitballing numbers. 
---
Yeah it's pretty rare.
---
It’ll be much harder for them to recruit when all their slots are filled up by people who can’t commit.
---
maybe you might have more luck if you didn’t phrase your tickets like a whiny loser
---
This is why there are so many more PvP servers than PvE servers right?
---
Needing on gear you dont need. For example a Mage needing on Best in Slot items for a Warrior purely for gold. The Mage doesn't "need" the item.
---
Then youre not so smart hunter
---
i enjoyed gehennas, no queuess, insta everything, so it was o.k for someone working 8hours a day. but now i'd need to wait like 30min-2hr to find a group for stratholme, while on gehennas when 1st grp was done i insta joined another group. i got baited into this shit by blizz and my guildies and i alrdy lost the will tbh. played on eough dead servers
---
I never stated you have a good chance at winning it. I implied you have a good chance at seeing it drop since \~26% is pretty good. The fact that you've seen it drop once in 3 runs means that you're already above average.
---
That's literally a thing. Look up speed golf
---
fastest way is to solo him to 15, learn how to agro and do stockade , possibly 1 level per hour. Then scarlet, learn how to pull, repeat. Mage is really good with pulling the entire low level dungeon for xp so it shouldn'r be  a problem
---
Grind in an unbusy area until 52 and then proceed to do what you already described.
---
Dont avoid STV mate will make leveling in the 30's eand early 40 sso much harder. its gots to be done unfortunately.
---
Yeah not really saying men are bad here, like be nice just have someone in the guild who understands I can't pee in cans and my boobs are sore lol jk but girls I can talk about lot of things just can't with guys and vise versa. 
---
Just like guys can only talk a certain way or things. It's different talking to your own gender.
---
Wow, just imagine being as upset about Blizzard supporting Hong Kong police attacking a pregnant woman as you are about this ninja’d staff.
---
[HK Police Pepper Spray abs Tackle Pregnant Woman](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QhrZH2PLY6c)
---
Blizzard makes it okay by keeping this mechanic. Rest is fruit of it
---
Your comment should be the first with the most upvotes. This explanation is a lot more reasonable than "Blizzard are lazy/dumb lol" or whatever stupid shit people posted in the comments. 
---
It'd still make sense to just exclude the last word from the sentence if your client can't decide about the gender, resulting in "Be healed!" for people who're farther away. 
---
Then again, it's not like that's something high in priority, although it also shouldn't make a huge effort.
---
There is a perfect solution for it in retail called personal loot. The funny thing is, as much as some people hate on personal loot, had it been in the game originally, nobody would ever think to ask for master looter. They would just have accepted it. IT really is a great system for dealing with loot drama.

Idk, maybe some people have even a shred of social competence?  It's all well and good to say "I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks about me, I'll do whatever I want" but if that's truly how you think 24/7 then you're a detriment to everyone around you.
---
How am i making it a generation thing? Outrage culture doesn't imply young people only.

You're one of those ppl read between the lines to get out a weird sentence. We're both 27yr and 28yr, adults.

So you are telling me that, when traversing from point A to point B you always lay a trap and only move within the trigger range of said trap and once you reached the edge of that trigger range place a new trap?

---
What do you mean by boomer? I'm not middle aged.
---
I'd be willing to bet that the priest and the hunter didn't just hook up out of the blue...
---
On a mob you can kill once per week, so on average you have 1 drop per month.
---
Add to that, that in an average raid 10-15 people will be interested in the staff (druids, warlocks, mages, shaman) and that 25% droprate doesn't look that great.
---
Besides, droprate isn't everything. I've been ubrs around 50 times now (aronud half full runs and the other half rend runs), I haven't seen a single battleborn armbraces (10% droprate), but 3 dal'rend mainhands (4% dropchance), also 0 Lightforge spaulders (19% dropchance)
---
As a Horde on Whitemane, Horde on Whitemane are hilariously bad.

If you are interested in PVP, find out how the class you are interested in act in a PVP environment, if that is something you find appealing go for it. Rogues are great in PVP and are also a fun class in general. The corpse ganking is as mentioned earlier over emphasized, there isnt that much corpse camping. Sure some 60s will kill you just to kill you, but very few will devote their time to gank a random lvl 35 in STV. 
---
As of lvling you should just level where you want to and where you need to, you are interested in PVP and you shouldnt avoid it, its how you learn. If something happens just avoid that area for a bit. Also if you are questing and meet a player from the opposite faction questing, most likely you both want the same thing, to quest in peace. There is no need to run around in the world scared of a PVP encounter, if it happens it happens, if you die you die. The first place you most likely will encounter equal lvl PVP will be Hillsbrad or STV, doesnt mean you should avoid them.  If you are interested in alot of PVP while lvling, rogue is pretty dominant.
---
I'm 1 1/2 bars from 51 and already prepped for Phase 2:
---
I purchased a dumpster truck full of KY jelly and have my snuggly pillow ready to go.  I made some adjustments to my set up so that I can remain laying on my back while playing.
---
&gt; Shamans are great for every other class thats why not many people play them.
---
Yeah tokens would be 🤢🤢🤢
---
I was on track to hit 60 but I took a promotion at work and I'm 43...
---
???????????
---
I got the mageblade on my first ever MC run because our GM treats loot fairly. You get to roll on class items you want and even the gm has to roll. Everyone gets a fair chance at the loot which is how it should be. I don't get how an item is so coveted that someone would basically steal it from everyone.
---
What patch was it?
---
For everyone claiming that this post isn't true. Read through this post from a few months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8avbb/investigations_vanilla_tier2_graphics_changed_in/
---
peope want their logs
---
People seem to think the horde side is dead. A few more xfers and we are golden.
---
It's not that rare considering you have to run MC for a year until BWL comes out, if not longer.
---
It's disheartening to see how lying, scamming and ninjaing can go unpunished, it's even rewarded (via the loot acquired). Do we want to kill any trust between players? Because that's into what it could spiral at some point. Fortunately most players are decent. No consequences for such acts can lead one to think "Do I want to be part of this?".
---
Shaman - Raid bosses stop being immune/heavily resistant to Nature Damage.
---
The OP said "name a more prestigious [WoW] orginization"... No one said it was specifically about Classic.  I don't think anyone is arguing that Method is better than Apes in just Classic wow.  Just like how no one can actually argue that Apes is better than Method in WoW overall.
---
I'm just worried that I'm so far behind I will spend all my time there getting ranked by bored horde
---
You did all that in 3 hours?
---
just remember guys the player drop off in this old and inferior game will leave it dead a month after launch.
---
 How are you bird?
---
The video quality is great.
---
The aoe is super RNG isn't it? If you resist the final ticks you're all good, if you don't it's a big ouch. Our tank takes no damage most of the time, but on a rare occasion he eats a 5k tick and possibly dies.
---
How can you even filter logs for SF? Apart from that, yeah - many of those top 5% parses have boss fights lasting 15 to 30 seconds, so no Rogue spec w/o Adrenaline Rush will stand a chance, as total DPS will be 40% to 20% lower.
---
Someone clearly rides the bench.
---
Tried mythic raiding recently? Compare LK and Mythic Argus or KJ.
---
Yeah I'm leveling a mage alt already :3
---
More and more I play Classic, the more I want Shadowlands.
---
Oh the dramaaa.
---
The game is 80% drama about loot or anything and 20% playing.
---
I love BFD and PvP but tbh, when I'm trying to get to the dungeon I find the horde more of an annoyance. Mainly because Alli are outnumbered 9 times out of 10.
---

But but every loot council is amazing and works flawlessly with noble and just raid leaders!
---
phase 4
---
Most servers will have several "cesspool" guilds - just large. anonymous guilds who invite whatever and whoever. If that's not your thing, check your server's Discord.
---
Also, just socialize. Fucking **talk** during a dungeon run. Be involved.
---
I intend to.  Actually it works out pretty well right now because my wife and I moved to Canada and I'm waiting on my residence application to go through so I can't legally work.

Had a guy ninja mageblade. Found a new guild instantly because now they don’t need to give a mage mageblade.
---
Ah fuck, he brought science into this
---
I was surprised by how fast it is with 10 people.
---
Any relation to the helm of dominance?
---
We went until last week without getting any Paladin T2 pieces.  In the last 2 resets, we've gotten 5 pieces (out of 8 total). 
---
It does even out in the end, but also class distribution can make it look like some pieces are more frequent than others.
---
Don't be surprised if that changes :)
---
It's not certain(nor likely) it will spawn right after 8pm, that's just when they will be able to spawn. With the spawn time being several days(unsure if it's the same as pservers?) its more likely that itll spawn on friday I reckon
---
Why not Druid?
---
Yes, and that entire concept is utterly idiotic and I can't believe Americans have let it be a thing.
---
Or you know it shows that you know your class and have done research to be able to do your role optimally in a raid. And that you’ve put the effort into getting gear instead of expecting to be handed free epics. Nobody likes carrying dead weight when they can instead take someone who will make the raid faster and smoother.
---
Reminds me of this classic (or should I say Vanilla meme):

Well, for me as a PvE player, layering is actually a good thing. I can play on a large, thriving server and still be able to farm. But i do get people who want to wPvP that hate layering, people can literally avoid you by joining another layer, which is honestly stupid.
---
The biggest issue with no layering for me is that the game mechanics, especially respawn times on mobs, are just too freakin' low to handle so many players. Usually, everything's just dead all the time, which isn't fun and makes things ridiculously expensive, e.g. over 8g per GFPP on Morgraine (Horde) atm. 
---
You (more or less) can't farm efficiently outside of dungeons, which is honestly pretty stupid. I'd love a smart layering that only layers the areas which are in highest demand that week, e.g. you'd join another layer if you farm in felwood, but as almost no one farms, say, WPL, that'd be mostly one layer only. It'd even out prices and force people to visit other areas to find lucrative arms.
---
Asmongold is an arrogant, talentless hack who spends most of his time doing very bad reviews of Youtube videos done by actual creators. Why people watch him is beyond me.
---
While all gnomes deserve to die they're still better than the other mage races on Alliance.
---
Like you can have one food buff and one drink buff at a time. So some buffs can be stacked if you figure out which slot they fall into because all items are either food or water but not both so even if it says it give mana like Halloween candy it’s still classed as a food item.
---
I think you have to do them manually/upload the info yourself somewhere.
---
Steal his look: robe of the void + felcloth shoulders + any red turban

It feels kinda buggy
---
not nearly as exploitable as DKP mate, the lists are publicly viewed and people adjust their picks accordingly. If you want to roll against someone you can do that, or you can choose to go for an item you won't have to roll against and will be yours. I see far more complaining with DKP than with LL
---
with DKP you still have the issue of people hording. decaying dkp doesn't really fix that. LL spreads loot around better and is not nearly as taxing on officers to manage
---
as for how we do it, if an item is on no one's list, its free roll, however you are limited to the number of pieces you can win per week
---
Yall treat it like this is some warcrime lmao
---
Thanks for the laugh this early morning! That’s hilarious. I did something similar when I first started playing CS:GO. I didn’t realize the voices with accents saying “nice shot!” and stuff were computerized, so every single time I’d reply into voice chat saying “thanks” or whatever. Eventually I started getting annoyed and told him he didn’t need to compliment me every time, when some guy in voice chat went “it’s a computer you absolute moron”. Needless to say I laughed my ass off when I realized I’d been talking to a computer (I had been smoking the herbal remedy as well)
---
Hasn’t it quite literally just started raining in this scene or one right before it?
---
So given that #2 is on the list, he’s most likely racist also. 
---
Noted.
---
Good to know me and my hunter buddy aren't the only people like that, after getting the arena chest we figured why not go duo lbrs for ubrs key and then farm the first boss for his truestrike... 
---
Got the key, cleared ubrs trash and looked real dumb once we reached the first boss.
---
No, it shows that you avoid thinking at all and still claim to be good.
---
Welp, time to start a guild.
---
You don’t have to have been “influenced” to be able to name products. You could just go to the grocery store.

You stop at the nearest/next FP. I used it maybe once or twice and it worked as it should.
---
Atlas loot says 50%. Either leaf or eye drops.
---
TL;DR most of the things you see that seem weird are the result of stuff like DPS meters existing and people trying to always min-max everything and theorycraft the "best" which often isn't the design intent. Hybrids weren't intended to just heal, for example, but do multiple things during an encounter (see why T1 is usually a mix of benefits). Min-maxers determined that their DPS was low and focusing on healing didn't take away the extra stuff you did, so hybrids got pigeonholed into healing. Stuff like that mace were never intended to be farmed to give better DPS, theorycrafters just figured out it helped and then it became the "best".
---
my guilie did it with sucsess. main point to get to min req lvl to enter dungeons like rfk and esp sm. u can farm those on a lvl60 for decent amount of gold while getting free exp for your alt
---
This dude deserves a lump of coal straight up his ass for Christmas.
---
Why exactly is Ninja'ing an Item so serious that hes getting kicked out of his team?
---
I never played WoW is there some more to it
---
Bird up!
---
Yeah it's pretty lame tbh. I'm not gonna lie, if I need a particular item I'll try not to invite classes that would likely roll on it but I've never just straight up reserved an item
---
All these misinformed classic players.  You are wrong.  It was aq.  Patch notes + I was there and saw the place holders in game
---
I allready wear the robe and shoulders but because of my guild tabard I didn't notice it's the same robe
---
haven't seen a single turban drop yet tho
---
I'm not sure if Raiding groups will take a Paladin as their main tank.
---
Or you know the other mages with soulshards and shit
---
well, the good news is that after 1 dungeon you are already better than 90% of the mages I have grouped with!
---
People get paid to play this game, so yeah, big deal to be a dick.

What can memers do against rule 7?
---
LBRS, Strat UD, BRD, at 58 you can go wherever you like, but don't join jump runs for DM:E, and UBRS groups may be somewhat picky. UBRS is also very poor exp.
---
It would have been better when WoW was more topical, when it was younger and all the real addiction stories where making their rounds around news outlets. Now days. Most people wouldn’t get it. 
---
Mobile games and their issues are still relevant, since they’re shit is still in the news spotlight.
---
Here on Transcendence EU several Bots in silithus and azshara. Me and other guildmates have reported them several Times over the Last couple weeks they are still Farming at the same spots
---
Your math is assuming you roll against 9 other people EVERY time it drops, which is not the case unless you're only running with pugs. In a guild, every time someone else gets it, you have less competition the next time it drops. In your example, 12 drops in a year and only 10 people who need it, every single person would have one and 2 of them have been disenchanted.
---
Do you use spy too?
---
You must be every tank I've ever healed since release
---
Soon.
---
I’m not entirely sure your statement makes sense bro.  Cate to explain?
---
My guild uses logs for review... And to compare Epeen.
---
Some of those look decent, not extravagant like the updated tier, of course. And then the warrior and pally ones just look hodgepodge.
---
I always wondered why the 'LFG' channel on my server is so barren, when some guy in the channel advised (this was well after I hti 60) that the actual LFG channel is called 'LookingForGroup'. Joined that and it has more messages in a minute than 'LFG' in an hour.
---
*shrug*
---
It was pretty good to be there for it, I don't need to be believed :D
---
Yea, it can be pretty lame when its 3 groups vs your 1 group lol. Organising a raid to combat it, isn't really practical either !
---
How do you kill that wich has no life?
---

His speed run was a complete sham. Having groups of people help you and warlocks summon you to place to place is not world first. Also this scrub doesnt even have freezing band. Of coarse he sucks.
---
Same thing last night on Razorgore waiting for Ony head to get popped, buff didnt register for about 10 mins after it was used, brutal.
---
Hopefully he doesnt cry too loudly so he doesnt wake his parents and yell at him. LOL
---
Fun fact : the 6 troll bosses will respawn.  If you joined a group that did 6 trolls then basement then waited 30 minutes for new players, those fuckers come back.
---
Yep. Way too many people want to blame whatever game/hobby that is taking up all their time instead of recognizing they have a problem prioritizing their time.
---
Thanks I reread it again and it makes sense now.

You can make patches to the client’s memory address space, you just have to intercept warden’s scanning procedure and replace it with your own.

I’m a holy pala in raid just that mc is not that hard so might aswell lose 20 hp for 35 sp and use the wepon for pvp and holding agroo in dungeon’s

We do this in my raid group too.

Rank 3 OMEGALUL
---
Everything is hunter loot.
---
I would really like hunters damage to scale more with stats instead of only weapon damage. That way they would possibly not be below average DPS from now on.
---
Apart from that, I would really like to have more than 3 pets. I have a wolf for raids, a cat for dungeons/solo content, but I would also like a tanky pet for farming elites, and a tallstrider for AFK show off in IF
---
You should be good for brd 58 for last tier of 5mans usually
---
Yes but OP is getting dismounted mid-air, that's not something you should be able to do at all and can be very abusable.
---
Thanks &lt;3 It is fun to share on Reddit.
---
I think he'll actually be remembered as the idiot who got world 1st 60 in classic, and then got booted by method for ninja-ing a non-bis staff during phase 1.
---
If you pug it, maybe you won't get it if you're unlucky. If you're in a guild every dps will have a weapon before BWL comes out. Some will have the Staff and the Sword.
---
I’m literally shaking rn
---
Just because they’re hosting a world first event doesn’t mean that they’re actively shooting for world first.  They did it for views and publicity.
---
It's the level difference, it directly influences the distance of stealth detection. This makes it rather hilarious when you see a lowlevel player trying to hide from you and you can see him clear as day from like 20m away.
---
Just wondering, do mages always prioritize +spell or when is +1% spell crit better? How do you compare the two?

Yes with honor ranks, grinding to 10 to get the full set is going to take a LONG time without bgs though.

---
Would go for 58 for the rest. You can look up the last boss levels for the other dungeons on wowhead or some other page, if it's 4 levels higher than you (or more) you'll be dealing very little damage to it, making it a 4 man fight instead of 5.
---
I liked him but i think the greed got him aswell withe little giblins, just my opinion
---
Perfect time to roll alts and meets in barrens

In short, yes you need to trust them. when it comes to enchants you can try to find an enchanter that have the mats and you trade the mats and fee at the same time as he enchants your item. But if they're willing to do that for you they're most likely trustworthy anyway. When it comes to normal crafting you can try to find a crafter that is selling an item they made and trade them mats for the item they allready made.
---
Seems fine to me
---
He wasn't on cam. Almost certainly had someone playing for him while he slept
---
And as I originally said, prestigious isn't the same as the best.
---
Method is the most prestigious, and I'd assume the best on retail, but they aren't the best at Classic and apes already proved that.
---
Yea as a guild me might!
---
Layering didn't exist in Vanilla so layerhopping=cheating. 
---
Or at least that's the mindset. I think that's a silly way to look at things, but hey, no matter who got the world first or how, somebody would be mad about it.
---
This as well. But replace mats, makes it more complicated to find enchanter for example since he has to have the mats.
---
It’s just a “heel turn”, ever watch wrestling?
---
Cats and bears don't have the thumbs required to open potion bottles.
---
Right click chat window options and enable status messages. I have a window that has everything on except /1 /2 /4 chat.
---
A curious thing it is, this streamer culture we have nowadays. It always makes me remember that famous quote from Lincoln.
---
"If you want to test a man's character, give him power."
---
I have seen many a streamer growing from humble to asshole with rising viewer numbers.
---
Ah one my fellow 1 in 16.4 billion rogues who's bothered to level it. Big up!
---
Nah, hes just an every day, run of the mill, cunt.
---
Does it never drop your framerates?
---
This is a great side effect of the system. Loot drops, people roll, continue the raid. No drama, no arguments, just a lot of grats in chat to the person who won.
---
Even running with 100% pugs and never raiding with the same people twice, which is absurdly unlikely, there will STILL be less competition over time because there will be more other people on the server who already have them. It may not be guaranteed in that scenario, but your odds will improve over time regardless, which is the point I'm making.
---
And again, let's not forget that's an extreme example by assuming you never raid with the same people twice in a year. Even non-guildies tend to develop develop regular groups they run with.
---
Yeah, the only boss to drop tier items themselves past Nefarian is Kel'Thuzad, who drops the tier 3 rings. But those were "optional" in the sense that you didn't need them to get all the set bonus', they were there so you could equip 1 piece of off-set gear.
---
But yeah, Blizzard recognized the trouble that bosses dropping tier themselves showed.
---
"thats a hunter girlfriend"
---
Agreed. Reputation is everything in WoW period. I’ve enchanted or created more items for people than I can count. Never once cheated them. That said, make sure you tip them for the work, either in mats or gold.
---
I give it a try thank you
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
I love the server too. I managed to find a guild a few days before release (Chromatic) and we've been crushing the content. People overall are pretty cool as well.
---
I've slept with 2 guildies I've met raid leading them a long while back on retail.
---
Women are just attracted to power and confidence, even if it is just bossing around sweaty neets and flexing in a virtual world.
---
It would take that long because I don’t think 52s to 55s could kill emp.
---
Except that you don't get full XP if that happens. Otherwise you would just tag mobs higher level than you and a higher mage would instant kill them all and get in a second full XP from 10 mobs. And it doesn't work that way. You get only partial XP from the kill.
---
I think if you search the AH for headwraps you'll find some turbans, I'm pretty sure that's what they're called in-game
---
For mages it's like 20-ish spell power for 1% crit I think, for warlocks you need quite a bit more due to Ruin talent. It heavily depends on how much total SP and crit you already have.
---
It can, WB have a chance of spawn each X mins
---
The way in which evaluations are done is based on media coverage, fucking duh.
---
There are a couple of fishing bots in The Barrens on my server fishing deviates. All level 10 with weird names. I’ve reported them but they are always there no matter what.
---
There is also the common "/join LFG" because a lot of people isn't aware of the 4. Looking For Group. So you end up with two lfg channels. 
---
I have three tabs, first is for general/say/etc. Second tab is for damage. Third is for LFG channels (no say, no party and no raid channels).
---
If you're not terrible, pretty much everything takes an hour.
---
I can't believe Bonethugz is fucking dead.....
---
Actually using game mechanics instead of blindly grinding is cheating now?
---
Accomplice would be a better term.
---
Hahaha
---
Now you know how us colorblind feel!
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
What’s crazy is to think this guy is a grown man.

This is so true it should be at the very top

This small indie company is putting their entire might into recreating the mystical lost technology of the ancients. Please understand.
---
Or a rogue on a horse
---
I have a chance of getting dismounted whenever I cross the border of a region (the moment I enter the chat of the region mostly). Sometimes it happens at first crossing, sometimes a bit later. For example I flew from OG to Ungoro twice, once I got dismounted the moment I left OG, the second time however it took me till thousand needles before it dismounted. Then I flew from thousand needles to Ungoro again, crossed the shimmerings without problems and then it dismounted me at Tanaris. Super random.
---
Uh...what? Maybe the first week or two, but if they're serious at all about ranking, even just like rank 10, and they spend even 4 hours a week "raid-zerg-wpvping" instead of honor farming the smart way, its gonna take them a loooot longer than people that aren't doing that kinda shit. What is your logic behind them "not losing honor" while in those raids? I don't get it.
---
I've literally never had someone steal mats from me. Besides the reputation of being a high level thief, I'm pretty sure blizzard takes action against mat thieves.
---
Honest question, why/how is Asmongold toxic?
---
You should update your addons. Atlas Loot had a lot of incorrect drop rates.
---
If it look like a ban, sounds like a ban a feels like a ban does it really matter if it isn’t a ban?
---
it did work that way for years after they introduced the self restoration, though.
---
PS WOTLK 11 years ago? It just came out on retail at that time.
---
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about.
---
Assuming you want the buff? Just turn it in 12 6 hrs before hand that way you have a idea when the next buffing opportunity will be ready. 
---
I tell ppl in the 3 ony groups just turn in get your neck we will save heads come later content where the buff means something.
---
BIRD UP!
---
The worst show on television!
---
So glad they won't. I understand you're sad that so-and-so stole your thingy. but it's not like they'll be able to continuously do it. name and shame people.
---
# NAME AND SHAME
---
It's like the only people you can do dungeons with are those on your server and if you piss them all off he'll be forced to quit, make a new character or move entirely.
---
/y  Be healed, $g priest:priestess;.
---
Ya something something nerzul something something burning legion. Arthas then got in a fight with a giant lava giant and said “wtf am I doing with this shit I use swords” so he smacked the giant in the face and said “I’ll have my peasants handle you. For all eternity people will kill you for your fat lewts that they don’t even really want but will inevitably pity grant to casters waiting for something else.” and then he threw the staff at him and left.
---
Just because layers wasn't in the vanilla doesn't mean it's cheating to use them since they were in Classic. Everybody had the same conditions.
---
No one is sponsoring him after this in the near future. He'll have to rely on his hundreds of viewers. Not all publicity is good publicity.
---
Which server is this?
---
Having 90% of ENH Shamans AoE dmg being behind totems that pull agro and die to 1 hit from grey mobs. (Yes, I know you can stoneclaw first, but it has a cool down)
---
Seriously, trying to run my mates through WC is embarrassing. They rather run it normally!
---
I haven’t done that dungeon in a decade but isn’t there skips in it.
---
 [https://it.classic.wowhead.com/guides/blackrock-depths-classic-dungeon-strategy](https://it.classic.wowhead.com/guides/blackrock-depths-classic-dungeon-strategy)
---
The trick is to put them on a pedestal and beg them to answer your prayers :3
---
Why can't he stream? And how do you know how much method was paying him?
---
probably meant leveled through dungeons with a carry the entire way.
---
If you discuss the deal in chat form first, and they take your mats and run, won't blizzard do something about that?
---
&gt;  The biggest thing he has lost here is a potential streaming career
---
His streaming career went downhill anyway. The only way for him to be somewhat relevant is to create drama.
---
Yeah, but there really is no other option. Most enchanters will have a stockpile of mats for different enchants, so it should be doable.
---
Otherwise just find the ones with a good reputation and a decent guild, they should be trustworthy enough.
---
It's got nothing to do with social competence, I can play the social game all day long and pretend I care if it has a purpose for me, but I don't go into a pathetic existential crisis if people don't like my latest IG post.  I don't need social validation to thrive, if anything, social interactions are almost always a net drain and not worth my time.
---
Even responding to this post would be an utter waste of time if not for the fact I have nothing going on at work currently and this passes the time faster than twiddling my thumbs.
---
Uh.. not inviting competing classes IS reserving the item, just without stating it. This is some weird moral high ground that people keep trying to take.  
---
I'd rather people reserve the item they're looking for so I can run with them if I already have or don't need it rather than that group refusing to invite any casters when hunting ban'thok or AP dps when hunting HoJ.
---
You can also go to reputable people. We got a pretty famous guild on our server that has most recipes. I don't think thay'll risk their reputation by scamming people and they don't invite randoms. While I likely pay more for their service, it's worth it for me.
---
Payed 50g for my Hide of the Wild crafting instead of taking one of the dozen people spamming that they craft it for tips.
---
Same:/ oh well
---
I thought that was the odds of it dropping.  The chance/probability is the drop rate.  No?
---
One in hillsbrad too
---
Were there any stops shown on the original path when you took in in Org?
---
This is correct. Blizzard will uphold agreements made in in-game chat. But without evidence of this (screenshot is best, but give the Rep a rough timestamp, and they can typically find it) they won't do anything. And anything said over discord, even recorded, doesn't count typically. The agreement needs to be made in the in-game written chat.
---
YES
---
yeah ill be hanging back and healing and just building stacks and then unloading on some random person. this follows the logic of "spellpower reckoning" you could say. the build i showed was literally just high stamina tier gear cause I heard drakova mention that its pretty good for this gameplan due to the stamina/armor/intellect allowing u to hang back and take that damage while u build stacks and heal.
---
What happened? What did he ninja? Is there a video?
---
rOfL yOu RoLlEd On A dEaD sErVeR?
---
It's breaking a contract which will get you dropped faster from any employment than cheating would.
---
Yup. First timer here! Haha. I’m, near as damn it, level 35 now and only found this out yesterday! Luckily I’m pretty good at laughing at myself, which has been a LOT playing this game... :)
---
The absolute majority does not give a rats ass about the fact that he ninjaed a staff.
---
His career with Method might be over, and his streaming career might take a hit, if he even had one to begin with. But you seem to heavily overestimate the amount an average WoW-player cares.
---
His friends (You can argue that he has no friends, but thats on another level) most likely does not care, so as a normal player he is as fine as ever.
---
Mankrik-US Alliance
---
Honestly pretty surprised by that. I recall that being a thing during Wrath, but I really cannot remember hearing about it since then.
---
crazy right bro?
---
I was hustling!
---
Thuggish ruggish booooone
---
Likely not as it promotes abusive behavior.
---
Imagine screwing up some aspect of your life cause of a fucking T1 staff in a video game. Dude deserves what he got.
---
Sorry don't know horde FPs so I don't know if that is a direct flight to camp mojache
---
I'm new to this whole RP thing, but I'm not sure why that name is not in the spirit of RP
---
The future is now, old man!
---
So much to learn!! I’m having fun doing it though :)
---
Not necessarily true. I'm in a large guild on Incendius and when either a guild or player does anything that warrants being avoided word gets around quick.
---
Atlasloot had the wrong numbers from the early itemization at first.
---
&gt;is there some kind of a hack involved or?
---
&gt;Is ninjaing rolling "need" when you should have rolled "greed"
---
That's the most common form, and a reason why they added need restrictions in later expansions. Another variant is what Jokerd did, being master looter and ignoring loot distribution consensus by giving items to yourself/non-eligible players.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_ninja
---
I think the WoW community enjoys ninja drama. Look at Asmongold, it's basically the foundation on which his stream was built. How to ninja loot in World of Warcraft is a classic video.
---
Strat, scholo, DM W/N, and UBRS groups would probably only take 60 rogues. It's doable at a lower level but many 60 rogues are available for these dungeons, so slot competition is high.
---
BRD and DMe is doable at 56 (or less, with a strong group). LBRS at 58.
---
I’m a 43 and it’s already bad for me as well. I like pvp but I was farming some mats in red ridge last night and it was a tank fest. Bunch of 60’s kept raiding the inn. 
---
Still never understood how it’s fun for a lv 60 to kill obs 15’s over and over. For like a half hour I guess I can see the appeal but these dudes do it literally all night. 
---
I don’t get it.
---
I love cannibalize. Makes me laugh every time. I haven’t won a pvp battle yet though, so haven’t had chance to use it in that scenario.
---
Once again, you overestimate how much people care.
---
If I were in charge of a guild, I might consider not recruiting a guy cause he ninja-looted something, because he is obviously the center of drama, and I cant be bothered with that, but I'd say that the majority, atleast over half of potential guilds would not care at all, no matter how much you spam trade and forums.
---
Spamming trade/LFG and forums just makes yourself look like a fool, and gets you ignored by a shit ton of people.
---
Method was most likely paying him to stream or by being with Method he got access to sponsorships that he could utilize.
---
Also if I remember correctly, shaman has the worst uptime for nightfall.
---
I don't believe I ever said you would be guaranteed anything. I said your odds improve over time if you're regularly raiding, which is 100% true regardless of fluctuations in an individual raid. And no reasonably competent guild anywhere is ever going to allow an alt to take gear that someone's main still needs. If I were running with a guild that did, that would be the day I started looking for a new guild even if I were not the one who got screwed.
---
Yeah, my guild has gotten three bonereaver's and no spell power rings. How does that work?
---
I mean, if you want. I rather just talk to them like a human being.
---
Lol. No wonder society is like the way it is with people like you. You excuse any type of personality flaw as an issue with mental health.
---
BWL isn't in a year, it's in 3-4 months. MC will continue to be ran up to Naxx though.
---
They're both good in different ways, but if you don't have Viskag, I would go daggers.
---
Paladins are just very strong.  On demand windfury, with 2 extra hits.
---
he lost his sponsorship/team org that were paying him, iirc
---
I really dont understand how people think he can just do it again.. Like you said uncontested mobs is 99.99% of what he did, aoe grinding that way is not hard in anyway, it is all about having the mobs for yourself. Literally 1 other person being there will make it much slower than just standard questing.
---
There is simply no way he can do it again, now he cant have areas for himself.
---
On older servers, it's pretty barren until the late 30's/early 40's. Alt's are starting to populate though.
---
Future money - lost sponsors/ad revenue/other things
---
The only thing I've heard that blizzard will uphold is in-game agreements for trading, such as trading your materials to have Lionheart Helm crafted, and agreeing to pay a fee. As long as it was typed out in the in-game chat and agreed upon, if the person then runs off with your mats, you will get the mats restored to you, and they will get a temporary ban (of varying length depending on if this happened before, up to 3 months).
---
So screenshot all important trade agreements, though I've heard that giving the Blizzard rep a rough timestamp of the agreement also works, I'd bank on the screenshot.
---
Ninja'ing loot, however, is something they will not address. It adds an interesting dynamic to the game, and yes, there is risk, but in the end, its just gold or gear. All can be earned in time.
---
Each time it drops, you should be rolling against one less person.
---
The most important part is knowing when he died, then you know when you don't have to look. Other than I'd recommend having a BM hunter with you. Their pet can move at 200% underwater.
---
So randoms don't deserve loot?
---
Not a fair comparison, he was already an established figure in the community pre-classic, he already had his audience and fans, they already respected and knew him.
---
Jokerd is a new thing, he blew up during classic, he's a classic player, that's his only identity.
---
I see what you did here and I like it
---
Totally agreed.
---
Good bot :)
---
You're free to not do it
---
There is RCLootCouncil which does something very similar to what you're after.
---
It requires some or several players to decide though.
---
Ganks are always gonna happen, especially in BRM. Just accept it :D
---
That said, dungeon grinding or playing at off hours should help.
---
Back in the day i took up skinning.  Then i would only farm mobs that i could skin.  That way there is no trace of you.
---
Essentially, kill the mob, skin, stealth.  Then make sure nobody is around before the next kill.
---
I grinded the last 5ish levels to 60 like this in wintersprings.
---
Any char over lvl 20 has to wait 30 days for name to be released.
---
Try RcLootcouncil
---
Options pop up for party to select “bis” “need” “minor upgrade” etc
---
Then everyone sees the rolls and raid leader gives it to highest roller or whoever else based on an LC system 
---
Everyone needs to have it installed though
---
That's pure biggotery
---
WPVP isn’t just going to die, people are morons for saying it. Guilds and groups of friends will still have some fun and group up to go raid an opposing factions town/city.
---
Well if his stream does take a hit its a heavy price to pay for a shitty staff. Not even the mageblade.
---
I get the logic behind this, but it seems odd that someone can mess up your character restoration if you happen to accidentally delete a character with a popular name.
---
Also, according to this comment https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20745354364#post-13
---
&gt; During that cooldown period you are not able to undelete that character if another character **on your account** has that name.
---
Note the emphasis. Surely they wouldn't mention it if it didn't matter which account the character was on?
---
Chiming in on the [Elixir of Water Breathing](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5996/elixir-of-water-breathing). They are only a few silver at the AH, and vastly improve your QoL under water. During leveling I bought a stack of 5 at some point (I think it was when I did Faldirs Cove), they lasted me all the way to 60, including leveling Lockpicking in Desolace and Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Y'all need to take a statistics course.
---
My client hasn't been updated at least so they seem to be telling the truth. It would be pretty dumb of them to patch millions of clients around the world when all the configuration of the phases is done server side.
---
In wotlk, in ICC there was this melee dps trinket that has a chance on hit to change you into different forms (like a worgen) and the raid leader Ninja'd it from me and proceeded to give his guildmates the tier pieces. A lot of us reported the situation and I received the trinket from blizzard. So i know for a fact that this can be resolved in the "victim's" favor.
---
Side note fuck that dude, Titankrs from Spinebreaker. Guy wasn't even good.
---
I don’t like the idea of ninja’ing being a reportable offense. Is this a new thing? I haven’t played WoW in years but I did play it from day 1 through several expansions and Ninjas were very common. You learned to play with people you trust and set loot rules with people you trust but even then it still sometimes happened.
---
When it did public condemnation, blacklisting by guilds one the server, hunting him for PvP (good times remember hunting ninjas) was all part of the experience and the fun and yes even the frustration.
---
But hoping to have his account banned or punished when he didn’t do anything outside of game functionally? That part seems wrong to me.
---
Everything else though... keep blasting him in social media. That is as it should be!

Druids (as well as priests) have spirit based mana regen of 13 + (spirit /4) per tick. A tick is 2 seconds.
---
So, 4 spirit are 1mp2 or 2.5mp5. This leads us to 16 spirit yielding 10mp5, or 1.6 spirit for 1mp5.
---
15% of that means that 10.67 spirit equals 1mp5 while casting.

The only way that we can make a difference is to teach our children to be different. My parents were abused by their parents. Did they grow up to abuse me? No. But they did teach me how much harm a person can do to another, and to value others highly. They taught me empathy.
---
Playing this game all day, yes, won't do anything. Bitching about snowflakes won't do anything. And honestly, most people you come across are too set in their ways to change. All we can hope for is that the next generation does better than we have.

[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-healing-stat-priority-classic-wow#spirit) should help. In addition to that, Innervate is Spirit based, right? If you can innervate yourself often or most of the time, that should also be taken into account.
---
You'd be surprised...
---
I have heard no such thing and haven't noticed any difference. I know they work like many other mobs, where they only charge at another player if they are "X" meters away. 
---
I strat is to have everyone stack to avoid charge, another is to have tank chain taunt it in a rotation since they won't charge if they constantly taunted.
---
DejaExtendedStats show you "current regen" and mp5 separately.  
---
And if you cast something, this "current regen" would be reduced by 75%.  
---
IIRC for druid weight of stats is next:  
---
1 mp5 = 3  
---
1 spirit = 0.43  
---
So coefficient between spirit and mp5 is 7: +10 mp5 equals +70 spirit

I leveled a warrior to 60 and collected 90 percent of my prebis using /join LFG which i thought was the main lfg channel. I complain on discord to my guildies saying I can't find pug groups, that while the server has a huge population it seems I see less pug group forming than on the private server i played on before. They all reply they didn't feel like it and that there is loads of pug groups.  
---
A few weeks later I start forming a UBRS group with guildies, we need to pug a few, therefore I start spamming LFG and World. 10 minutes into looking, one of my guildie whispers me : "/join LookingForGroup"
---
The flood of pug group adverts blew my mind.

---
As a warlock Crit is valuable , however spell power wins out most of the time because of the low hit ratings casters can acquire in phase 1/2. We won’t be able to hit cap in this patch. You’d rather take a bunch of spell power and some Crit when you can conveniently. Most players will do trial and error to find their sweet spot anyways. I prefer to just stack SP and if Crit fits I take it
---
Just dont be afraid to waste reconning stacks by switching to S&amp;B. Otherwise I don't see the problem with your gear. Like i said, don't plan on hitting as hard as Drakova does. I'd say under battlefield conditions you'll be hitting 2k max with a full stack. Do think about dropping one of your DPS items for extra healing gear and put the disarm immunity gloves from strat on. Disarms hurt Recc fairly hard and you'll likely wont put a chain on hand of rag.

Thanks to WoW, I went from making \~30e/day to making \~800e/day. I went from having shitty gfs to having the best woman ever. I went from living in a shithole 4th world country to living in a pretty good one and I went from having basically no understanding of the economy to actually understanding quite a lot of it. That's on top of two foreign languages that I am now able to speak much better than before (thanks, teamspeak and ventrilo - they're like discord, if you're that young!). I went from actually working my ass off (for the 30e) to browsing random stuff I don't even care about for this amount of money (which is what I'm doing now; yes, I'm at work).
---
I'm not even joking.
---
Abusing an exploit in layering isn't using in game mechanics. It's an exploit, that's why it was patched it because it was never intended to be used in that manner. Exploiters are cheaters, that's why in every online game ever, they are treated as such. Not only did they abuse layering, they abused the 10 man raid bug that allowed them to do things like run SM graveyard over and over only having to make 3 pulls. They exploited bugs within the game, they did not use in game mechanics as intended.

I think he's talking about the second *their* as in "You can tell *their,* they are, bots".
---
It's chat parser. How it could drop frame-rate?

Do you think he will share?

Son, I think we’re all playing on an official server now.
---
The amount of people that don't know the auto unstuck character feature is too damn high!

I believe this time it\`s "we wanted to kick this guy anyways but now we have the excuse for it".
---
Abusing layering was so powerful that optimal gear all the way to 60 isn’t even close to compensating for it. More int is just going to let you cast more blizzards which after a certain point doesn’t matter because the mobs die after a few blizzards anyways. Also he will no longer have the aoe spots to himself. Before, he was so far ahead of the leveling curve that he had no competition.
---
Exploiting bugs within the game, that were subsequently patched.
---
Literally got like 7 druid drops last night at our MC. Was infuriating
---
In terms of what?  Retail?  Presumably method.  Classic, so far it would seem to be apes.  Overall?  Apples and oranges, the game isn't the same so the comparison is pointless because I guarantee that if method gets stomped in every classic raid release, they and their fans will just fall back on "well they're the best overall" when that isn't even the point.
---
"Man you got stomped in that baseball game"
---
"Yeah well I'm the best at soccer so I'm the best overall at sportball"
---
"Those aren't the same game and are only related as far as the fact that both uses are played with a ball"
---
I’m jokerD and the jokes on me!
---
If someone mentions wPvPthey're obviously not talking about PvE servers.

Stop inserting yourself into everything PvP related if you don't care for it.

I don’t want hots on me as a maintank because it pushes down my world buffs. Idc about ur mana but don’t kill my buffs thanks

It’s been suggested that some US servers are upward of 100k (Pagle for example) I saw some numbers a few days ago but can’t seem to find them to reference currently, also no saying how accurate they are cause I believe they weren’t directly from blizzard
---
Really? People actually have swallowed the "it's good for workers" thing?
---
&gt; Even with At-Will employment you can most certainly sue (successfully) if your employer fires you unjustly.
---
This only ever happens with overwhelming evidence of them firing a protected class. As in they straight up admit it. As someone who's seen workers rights abuse in action it's shocking what companies get away with so long as they simply don't give a reason, or be extremely vague about whatever one they go with.
---
&gt; It also has the benefit of allowing you to just walk out one day if your company pisses you off enough and there's nothing they can do about it.
---
... are you under the impression you can't do this regardless? This is **always true**. Outside some very specific examples that would have legal contracts drawn up anyway, if you don't want to go to work? Don't show up! Had enough of their shit? Walk out! Nobody is rolling up to your home and dragging you back to work. I'm sure there are a couple exceptions (government/military/jobs with a duty of care or whatever) but by and large if you don't want to work there you just say "fuck this I'm done" and walk right on out. At worst you lose any separation benefits in your contract if they require notice, that's it.
---
"At will" employment is framed as being good for workers, when it quite literally is just the removal of workers rights.
---
Botting is way worse than you know.  There are quite a few people (over 10) I know with 100+ bots in their farm all on classic.

We had a priest rage quit in our 4th mc raid because we didn't let him roll on t1 bracers because he had already received 5 pieces of loot in our runs including benediction first raid (more than any other priest at the time). He quit the game entirely over it. Haven't seen him log on since.
---
My first MC raid coming up and I'm tasked with at least 100 fire resist.  Any tips on good sources of fire resist mage gear?

What are all the 2h enchants available at this point? I'm only seeing +int and wanted to make sure that was the only option before I went for it
---
Why is he done. I missed something

Nice generalization, boomers or any other generation are not better. A boomer radio-hos said that the word "boomer" is like the n-word.
---
Isn't there personal loot or something in retail?  If so then there isn't a point if everyone gets their own stuff that isn't shared.
---
Okay, if you insist.
---
I hope so
---
I can think of more than that. Risk, Bane, Surreal, Nilla Wafers, amd Asgaard are all clearing MC with no issue. Some have multiple raid teams. I'm in a smaller guild (Retro) and we just started raiding as well last week. We've killed everything but Ragnaros who we are going after this reset.
---
Stormlight is leaking.
---
I kinda feel like you just want to argue at this point. Whether it's 100% certain or not, odds are much better than you're implying that if you're raiding every week, you will eventually get the staff. Will there be some people who get unlucky? Probably. Does that mean it's an incredibly rare drop worth ninja looting and ruining your reputation for? Probably not, which is the entire topic of this post.
---
The question is how many people can be logged into the server before the Q goes into effect. 100k is the amount of charters created on that server.
---
Wow that guys voice is annoying
---
Where? :D
---
We have 4 in guild. Killed Ony 6 times.
---
Definitely, but it was an additional source of revenue that got burned. Even if he wasn't being paid at all by Method, just being affiliated with them increases his "brand" and brings in more viewers and potential subscribers/donations.
---
Sounds like a great plan.
---
fishing levelling speed is unaffected by zone. You could go from 1-300 in a starter zone.
---
The nubmer of required fish per slillup increases though, it's 1 for 1-50, for 290-300, you need 10.

I've at least twice seen a hunter and his pet out hunting, realizing the "pet" was a druid only after the "pet" changed form back to a humanoid.
---
yes, as I guess we all do. But between the bound gear, bound consumables, maraudon sceptre, UBSR sceal, keys, various reputation bound items I'm saving up for later when i can't advance reputations by killing alone, and every thing else "bound" that you can't even send of to a mule, well that's it. Bank is full, inventory is half full, and all non-bound items are just permanently kept in the mail, to be available at any time.
---
And to think at first I was deluding myself thinking I could keep my mail armor monastery set as a souvenir !

AGM on average shields for 1000 damage. Say the frost bolt doesn’t crit, on average you’ll probably absorb just under two frost bolts (I’d say their average damage is 600) and you will be slowed by these frost bolts. In the case of frost reflector, not only do you stop 600 damage, but you inflict the damage back at the attack doing 600 damage to them AND slowing them, creating a 1200 hp difference which is MORE than AGM. Also, the reflector slows them instead of you! This is huge! Frost reflector is by far better, for this reason alone. But on top of that, it gives 15 frost resistance which is better against a mage than dodge.
---
The more players the more exp gained so your better off running a full party of lowbies. You can get upwards of 40k an hour on SM libs with a group of mid 20s there. You should look at some XP breakdown spreadsheets it's very interesting to know.

&gt; That's because Seal of Command could only proc 7 times per minute
---
I'm wondering where this is from since I don't remember this info from the spell itself?
---
The spell power coefficient for blizzard is crap, having the extra int needed to cast an additional blizzard is way more useful for AoE farming where you drink to full after each pull anyway
---
Apparently more then usual for such a mounted defense
---
Looking at girl ass all the time &gt; looking at dude ass all the time
---
Not true, back in wrath I was in a group running for ashes of Alar.  The mount dropped and we rolled for it, I won the roll but the raid leader gave it to himself. I put a ticket in and they took the mount from him and gave it to me. I know cause at the time I got a very hateful whisper from a man wishing death in my family.
---
The spellpower to damage ratio is just extremely low. I takes a ton of spellpower to make a small difference to the damage of your blizzard. Leveling gear generally has one stat or the other, and in most cases it makes more sense to have more mana to cast another Blizzard than it does to have more spellpower to increase the damage of your blizzard.
---
I'm not trying to argue for the sake of arguing, I'm defending my original point when people respond with counter arguments. Just because I'm responding doesn't mean I'm needlessly contrarian.
---
Yeah actually
---
you wish, the fact you can't jump servers means everyone playing like assholes should go back to retail to love in their douchebag very. anyone worth anything will keep it known in the community.

I‘ve seen a bunch of Chromatic! We‘re Symbiosis, and we even have a lot of original members making it a pleasure to play :)
---
What's your /played?
---
Boy I sure hope you've never bought a single product in your entire lifetime, or this is sure one hypocritical rant.
---
It's such a minimal boost you're much better off going for int and stam. But if you have enough int and stam to survive and kill the mobs consistently, you don't really need any more of that either.
---
On the internet.

It's a grind go at your own pace hit some dungeons if your questing and change things up.

Leveling and most of wow isnt really hard. It is all about the time investment.

alright you got me that was pretty good

bb means mining, right?
---
I'd say keep tailoring, you'll need it in phase 4 again and ore isn't that expensive. Only arcanite is really expensive, when it comes to metals and that's a rare chance anyway.
---
Great comment, man. “Do nothing because it won’t change anything anyway” is killing our culture and society. And it’s bad for WoW too!
---
So it's picking up speed? ;-)
---
Nah. As a tank I've made dozens of groups. The handful where something is reserved tend to fill up equally fast as the others. Mages and locks don't care if you reserve BSR, they just want the run.
---
I’m getting there! Stuck at about 150 right now. Been PP farming SM (I’m only level 42) to get as many worn chest as possible but the levelling is slow!

What glasses were you wearing?
---
I don't suppose there's a way to increase it beyond what's available in settings, right? It would be really helpful when checking for some rare dungeon spawns.
---
That's not true? I literally deleted my level 20 druid, got my mate to make the char, clicked the icon to restore and was prompted for a name change.
---
Because dungeon layering can be abused LMAO.
---
Mohawk and no jaw, or frontflips. Those are the options you're really looking at.
---
100 is too much.

~70 is good balance between DPS and suitability.

I did it yesterday having my friend make the char and login whilst I restored it and I was able ot change the name np.

Maybe, maybe not but the fact remains that he (and possibly somebody helping) was still first to reach 60.

You can fight back better?

Unless your server is not 50/50

Hmmm I ended up meeting up with one of our priests who was the druid officers wife..... And she moved in and we dated for like 2 years after her very sudden divorce. Those priests just can't resist the locks!

Nope, giving players server information has caused them issues in the past.

At the same time I've been in other raiding guilds with female members that were perfectly drama-free. 
---
It's really less about boys vs. girls and more about adults vs. children. The drama queens/kings gonna drama regardless of what the gender comp is.
---
Similarly in the story I posted above - any one of my guild officers would have been considerably smarter to kindly demurr when miss shadow priest raised the prospect of coming to visit their home city and 'see the sights'.
---
My guild uses EPGP. Got Mageblade and Mana Igniting Cord in one night. (Granted now I'm basically bottom of the mage PR lol)
---
Enhance is one of the worst solo specs in the game. You don’t even really level past 40 solo as Enhance.
---
&gt; You're the exception to the rule good Sir. And that's absolutely good for you but doesn't negate the point being made.
---
Give a man fishing rod and he'll catch fish and eat and whatever.
---
Give it to another man; he'll take it apart and stab someone with the sharpest part. 
---
Give it to a woman and she'll complain that it doesn't taste good :)
---
It's not the fishing rod that's the problem. That's all I'm trying to say.
---
The fuckups people were talking about were always going to be fuckups. They simply lacked the opportunity until WoW came along.
---
So instead of getting a toon to 60, I got every horde class to 20. Now it’s time to really pick I think. 
---
I’m between Warlock, Rogue, and Hunter. Im planning on mostly solo leveling but I do have a guild (I’m just too far behind them right now). I’m fairly casual, I would raid not that often tbh. I’m also pretty interested in PvP but I’m worried about not having raid gear (I don’t have to be the best and losing, I just don’t want to always get dumpstered). 
---
I’m almost thinking Rogue since I’m late here at Phase 2 and can pick my fights and sneak past groups?
---
No idea but Frostadamus is also in the same boat. I reckon it’s because on the private server friends he must of made before classic.
---
Succubus or felhunter.
---
It's the thuggish ruggish
---
Thugstas that pump slugs. Give it up give it up give it up
---
It's gonna take longer than a few weeks to get any pvp set items
---
When you organize a raid you declare loot rules beforehand and are expected to adhere to them. If you promise to distribute loot by rolling (with main spec having priority), breaking that promise is considered ninjaing.
---
in private servers he lvled up for 2-3 days. He literally can get another mage in few days.
---
Imp weapon totems is like 25 DPS and you’re better off just getting an actual DPS class there. Most overrated talent of all time probably.
---
The OP is wrong, they absolutely did not look like this before AQ.
---
Pretty sure Succubus for the charm. Or does that fel pet manaburn?
---
World bosses have the ability to spawn anytime between X and Y amount of days after the last kill. My guess is that at 20:00 server time EU it starts at time X and it can come up anytime between then and time Y hence being completly random on each and every server.
---
How do I get this one to load inside classic? Copy to the Addons folder?
---
Organization is not a guild. I don't recall APES paying their members to stream.
---
Bonethugz
---
It has good stats especially if you care about pvp
---
1% crit is worth approximately 1% of the average damage of your frostbolts. If you're hitting for 800, then 1% crit adds 8 damage on average, which is ~9 spell power.
---
In Lootcouncil runs we also like to call it the Staff-of-no-mageblade because when you get it Mageblade will always be a bigger upgrade for your competition.
---
As has been stated above, your math is very incorrect.  It's clearly stated earlier that the 100 is a soft cap, the depreciation is intended to be a limiter for participation only.  The on time bonuses are the edge required to get over the soft cap.   I would have to open my spreadsheet but believe the point beyond returns was 133DKP in this system.   It's whole purpose is to promote spending the DKP while promoting on time attendance.   133DKP should be reachable in around 11-13 weeks if you really really wanted to, but it also keeps you from endlessly compiling DKP and basically wiping out say BWL for 3 full clears of any loot other players might want. By basically reducing you do a Max of 2 items per raid with a 50% spend ratio that doesn't actually punish you eternally for spending dkp.
---
It's a very easy system, it rewards those who save points, and doesn't lock out new players for months at a time where they are spending on consumables to only be told they cannot loot anything of value.
---
Press F for my dudes on dead servers, a fate worse than any gank or corpsecampjng
---
You are right, they were. The patch history on the wikis have some errors.
---
It's pretty great. The only criticism I have is that it started _a little_ slow. I feel like some of the stuff you unlock in Chapters 3/4/5 could've been including in 2/3.
---
You mean Path of Glory?
---
&lt;Laughs in Shadowpriest&gt;
---
Hunter. Send your pet, start auto attacking, AFK.
---
The problem is that when you address this issue (playing more then you should), people feel offended and point to people that binge watch TV, then say 'how is WoW different from that?'. And they're right, it's not. But that's not important.
---
What's important is that ANY activitity that causes you to move away from healthy time management and durable self investment (for your future) is not good. I think the general drawing line should be where you start to not attend school, report in sick for work / underperform due to fatigue or jeopardize a relationship with people you genuinely care about. 
---
If any of those things start happening I think you're crossing a dangerous line and should consider taking action. If not, then who cares how many hours you put in. That's how I view it at least.
---
To clear things up for /u/wavymitchy : It's likely not the ninja'ing in itself that has gotten him removed from Method, but rather also his behaviour on stream afterwards where he acted like a 101 douchebag.
---
Can someone explain to me how the frost reflector works? Are you immune to frost nova when you use it? If you want to reflect, say a frostbolt, do you have to use the trinket before the cast is finished or can you use it when the frostbolt is midair flying towards you? Thank you!
---
Well these fuckers' success is fleeting at best. They can live a few years, maybe a decade but they cant keep paying the bills by farting on stream.
---
Asmongold doesnt ninja tho. He is veeeery clear that he Will taket all the loot he wants before the Raid, People (His viewers) join the raid anyway.
---
So...you get a good amount of whispers for group, which means you have some variety choice in dps classes, and you prefer to pick classes that won’t compete for your drops...but that somehow isn’t the same as people reserving items?  
---
Not sure I can decipher how these are remotely different.  Short of saying you are reserving an item, you are explicitly picking classes in the same way as a reserve group.  
---
There is nothing wrong with reserving an item.  If you want to put the effort into putting together a group of people who are fine with the reserve, how does that adversely impact anyone?  Like it is some poison to the Classic community.    People act like it didn’t happen in Vanilla.  
---
If little Jimmy the dps Warrior is too lazy/incompetent to figure out how to tank BRD and form a group in under 5 mins, why should I invite him to my arena/anger/golem to take my BiS drops?
---
But other people will be getting mageblade so you have less competition
---
They are smarter than anyone else, in their eyes, so they will seek out sources of knowledge that are niche or “secret” - and that’s how you get a conspiracy theorist
---
Huh. I thought it was a localisation issue. Guess not!
---
Int gear barely exists when you're at a realm first pace.
---
[That's a beautiful statement](https://i.imgur.com/Q2Z7B68.png)
---
He'll be looking at bones regardless
---
In a guild you typically also want to reward attendance in some way. Otherwise it can be hard to motivate players to do content they personally don't need anything from.
---
Indeed, simple.
---
Yes, but not close to the first one.
---
You’re drastically wrong lol
---
&gt; I understand, my grip with your comment was that looked like you were saying to not use this system when you have randoms, and reserve drops only for the guild.
---
That's what you read but that's not what I said.
---
Who the fuck is a pally tank? Lmao

I don’t think he’s getting back in, it’s not the ninja but the fact he seems like a legit sociopath
---
I wonder... are you putting no apostrophes where they should be and some where they shouldn't on purpose?
---
To be fair, you do outright say in two different paragraphs that INT is more important than +healing. Not that big a wonder why people would think that's what you actually mean.
---
Suspect you just jumped off yourself for a cool Reddit screenshot... So yeah.
---
Aye, but aren’t both available? I didn’t know they were mutually exclusive.
---
As a hunter who beats basically every mage, I don’t understand why you think we need to viper sting to win. Mages are so ridiculously squishy, that even my raptor strikes chunk them. Multi shot -&gt; Autoshot does like 70% of their health. A reflected frostbolt is much more useful in this scenario than a shield.
---
Good to know, thanks for that.
---
I think after the 7 procs I can still just refresh Seal of Command so it will proc again right?

All I did was make a joke because what you were saying sounded like "Transportation sure felt different back in the day - we didn't have all the security at the airports and horses pooped on the street everywhere". Yes, both of those things were technically in the past but not from the same era. Neither were smartphones and 56k modems.
---
But it clearly flew over both of your heads and instead you're trying to explain how use of the internet increased over time. Obviously it did.
---
Asmon made 600k+ last year bet it’s higher this year
---
IMO if you are still 55 your time is better spent getting to 60 and getting some pvp gear (stam and int are the priority).

Yeah, people are envious, obviously. Go back to Twitch and suck JokerD's limp dick a bit more.
---
&gt;They're fine. Pre-MC daggers are great for everything including PvP and clearing MC
---
They're all shite, and significantly worse than all sword options. 
---
MC daggers are ridiculously good, ofc.
---
Try [AutoBar](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autobar-classic). If that doesn't work I guess you'll have to take Dominos + Dominos: Classic Skin and spend some time working on your UI.
---
My apologies i misunderstood the question
---
Haha ok wait for them to kill you. Sounds mad efficient!
---
Then they already fucked up, we are two patches in since release based on client number.
---
And pvp is known for requiring masterful skill and not being a mindless grind!
---
Yes that was a stupid answer of mine...
---
Alright, I'm responding to many comments a bit more than I'd like so I'll end my end of this discussion on this.
---
After about a year, I'd expect 40% of people with any interest in the staff to have it, 40% to have mageblade, and 15-18% to be fresh 60s (alts or new players), and the rest to be the most unlucky bastards ever. To me, that still makes getting them relatively rare.
---
Yes, your chances go up every time someone gets one, but it doesn't exactly convince me to be expected to get it pretty fast. If something expectedly takes me a few weeks or *maybe* a couple months to get, I consider that rare.
---
man you think you stand a chance as a fresh 60 versus pvpers? Getting some extra levels does almost nothing.
---
Wrath would look so good without those huge blades on the shoulders
---
If you consistently top the weekly ladder you’ll have access to the first items at week 3 of the honor system. Before that you’ll have trinket, back, wrists and other snazzy stuff.
---
Shout out to the dedication of that horde raid sitting on Thorium Point for 2-3+hours last night. Most folks would go eat dinner or take a bathroom break but y'all persisted and didn't let anyone do anything ;)
---
Genuine shout-out to Colony though, UD Priest - dude clearly had a clue what he was doing and took my ass out most of the time. Your buddy Shockerr can suck it, though. Lol
---
10 different every FOUR weeks because in your scenario a staff drops every four weeks. And that’s assuming that these people who are clearly running with other groups have all yet to win it, every four weeks. It’s so improbable and the fact that you use this unique scenario as grounds to give people a 2.5% chance in a full year of MC.
---
It’s a pathetic analysis and you’re arguing for no reason.
---
I'm aware that Moonglow is the main spec. The only change I'm really doing is using improved Reju over gift of nature. That's what i tried to state on the post
---
He already got kicked from method lmao
---
You spelled Judgement wrong
---
Feral, Resto once BGs come or if you have a teammate.
---
&gt;Thinks the guy was serious... 
---
Melodramatic much?
---
I want the keyring, too, but jesus christ
---
Right, but I wouldn't define rareness by your chances of acquiring it; I would define it by the chances of it dropping (the chances that *someone* gets it).  The odds of me winning a $100 gift card in a raffle against 300 people are very low, but that doesn't mean $100 gift cards are rare.
---
I know, I'm just being sarcastic. I literally replied to everyone "Ok Boomer". The constant complaining about P2 has me feeling salty lol.
---
It doesn't, Classic toolkits shows 15 buffs but chars can hold all the buffs
---
How much for you to go back, buy it and ship it to me in TX?
---
Felheart is pretty trash outside of pvp. The robe is ok, but there are better options.
---
Where have I stated I'm jealous? You seem to think that when somebody is calling you out/calling bullshit they're immediately jealous/triggered? Nah man, good for you that you've got that life I just don't get why you feel the need to state your wife is a 9/10 and you're in the top 1%. 
---
Why not just say I have a wife and a well paying job. It's pathetic that you **have** to state it otherwise, the values have no relevance on the argument you're making.
---
Sorry, meant 8pm for European servers when the world bosses can start spawning.
---
Over 9000
---
&gt; I actually respect him for looting.
---
It shows your moral compas is broken.
---
No, but my guess is 30k max
---
Lmao, as if he would know anything about women anatomy. Highly doubt he met one in real life. xd
---
&gt;  think the spell power is more important especially during this phase since most fights are pretty short so I don't need to worry about running out of mana. I carry enough potions / demonic runes as it is already. 
---
Tbh, the 12 SP you get from it does not weigh up against the sustain from the Mp5. Mostly because of the coefficienty of your spells. And if you already need to use potion during these short fights. You def appreciate the mindtaps in bwl and up.
---
He can join Asmonshit ninja team.
---
In my experience they were never up when the servers would come back up on Tuesdays, but each weekly reset did seem to reset their spawn window starting with the moment the servers come live.  Essentially once the servers came up, they were a good bet to spawn sometime in the next 12 hours.
---
I don't know if this is how it actually worked or an extreme coincidence, but in my experience the world bosses had an extremely high rate of spawn on the server reset day.
---
Lol 25 min for a perfect dm trib run here I am doing it solo in 15 hahahahahaha
---
Imagine losing sponsorships and impacting your income to ninja some pixels in a video game. 
---
What's more embarrassing, someone being a bit upset over a ninja, or some dude who values a purple more than his job?
---
Yeah, but that's not from a team with corporate sponsors. 
---
Fun fact, Grubby has less than 10% of Asmond's viewers and makes half of that.
---
With my lock being only 54 and haven’t been to BRD yet, what’s the “safest” way into BRD trying to avoid some of the ganking?
---
The lube has been sold out at my local supermarket, nuff said
---
Oh no, now one of the other 11 million players will have to support their subscription
---
This works? Does Ret Aura benifit from +Spell Damage?
---
What Prot talents should I invest in for pvp if I am keeping my holy talents for raids and a pve spec (guild raiding requirement)
---
&gt;  to give people a 2.5% chance in a full year of MC
---
Not 2.5% in a full year. 2.5% in each instance of that situation, which is unarguably true. Your chances increase with every attempt, naturally (if you run this scenario 10000 times, your chances of receiving one are ever inching closer to 100%, without ever reaching 100%). 
---
The whole premise was a hypothetical to justify the item being considered somewhat rare, not impossibly rare like it seems everyone is interpreting it.
---
One of these changes your interface, clearly requiring a small update.
---
One of these are already in the game and server side need to be enabled, most likely by a small script.
---
If the honor tab wasn't already in the game, we'd most likely need to see an update to add it.
---
I know it's popular these days to just ree about everything, but just take a step back and think for a second.
---
I wonder, what exactly is "the bot"? Do you think there is one particular code fragment known as "the bot" used by everyone that does botting? And it always behaves the same and is capable and not capable of the same things? Because if you think so, you're mistaken.
---
Nope that’s not true. That’s why enchants on head and legs are a problem. You have a buff limit
---
/dismoount
---
I'm a tank so I need to hang on all to all my keys since I'm always called to tank whatever. beyond that im using literally every bag slot in my bank as it is already. I've got a ret set, mitigation prot set, spell damage prot set, pve and pvp healing sets, fire resist, shadow resist, and a bunch of other pieces that switch out interchangeably like trinkets and engineering items
---
You’re onto it. 
---
The biggest cause of slower levelling in the game right now is other players.
---
Is there any reason to camp for brokentooth if pet speeds have been normalized?
---
Well, to be honest, that's not all there is too it. I mean if he was extremely cool and ninja'd it I doubt that guy on reddit would have made a post about it, like he said it's just gear he didn't really need that much in the end. The entire situation blew up because he is such an asssshooollleee. His behavior and attitude are just not deserving of the privileges he received.
---
Legend
---
I gave them the benefit of the doubt and they continue to prove they are planning this in a dumb way.
---
There is so much shit which made no sense to exclude from launch like the keyring or the level 50 quests and shit like this one makes it looks worse.  They will release it on the first patch, until it doesn't happen.
---
&gt;Are you immune to frost nova when you use it?
---
No, it doesn't work on AoE spells, only targeted.
---
&gt;can you use it when the frostbolt is midair flying towards you?
---
Yes, it procs on the actual hit, i.e. the moment you would see the incoming damage (or the entry in the combat log).
---
on the german forums there were some posts about 4k players concurrently per layer
---
It sure is, it was the best video I could find on short notice about the rogue stunlcok
---
What I don't get is why do that on the staff? its hot garbage compared to the mageblade
---
I don’t know, I think the fighting between farmers will be intense since you’re now fighting for honor and the resource.
---
Buy yourself some invis potions....
---
Oh I know, but if there's a mage in the party why not buff so it's a little bit faster?
---
I do agree that if your skill level is low to the point of having issues then that person shouldn't be tanking. Or at least train it before entering.
---
And then have blind, or vanish sap and can do it again.
---
Can you LoS it as the warrior, or do you just mean the healer?
---
Who cares when they make enough to last them a lifetime?
---
It's not about the effort as much as it is about the risk. If you spend years of your life for a 5% chance to become successful and 95% to become a nobody, that 5% deserve better payoffs than those who spent those years working regular jobs. And it's not just "celebrity culture", it's the same in many other areas like sports or music.
---
He only used layering from level 58+ so it’s not like it will be drastically longer.
---
If a rogue opens with cheap shot on a warlock without a pet or the sac debuff he isn't a good rogue.
---
I read somewhere to get a better vanilla experience by not using questie (because I want to have to read quest texts). But maybe that’s the problem I’m so slow.
---
That's a fair point, but I personally don't see the definition of something being rare being that I see one. I consider something rare to have. Diamonds aren't rare, but it's pretty rare to acquire one, maybe only twice a year, if that, for the average person?
---
&gt; maybe my memory is failing me
---
Its not, the Wiki is just wrong
---
I’m not taking away his achievement. It’s world first. I’m not going to pretend it was unassisted though; he had people collecting fetching and carrying the whole way, and the last few levels abusing layering was definitely a thing.
---
easy to have bank space as a mage. try playing a class who's end game isn't pressing literally 1 button while in frost damage greens. I say this having a 60 mage myself
---
Extremely well paying?
---
that would cause a complete mess tbh. I'm leveling an alt on a pve server and all the engi stuff for example is so so cheap it's ridiculous. U could stockpile on all the usefull pvp stuff without spending a dime on those servers. Also much easier to get those high level mats due to no ganking.
---
Again, any one can beat shitty rogues, my hunter can beat mages and spriests, but does that mean "HUNTERS ARE COUNTERS TO MAGES AND SPRIESTS" no, it means the ones i beat were morons
---
The wiki is simply wrong. The new models were there way before AQ and 1.9
---
How are you, bird?
---
That's losing earning potential, not losing money.  It's not like method can fine him and take money he already has.
---
I find classicwow genuinely receives a second class level of communication that's already poor relative to Blizzard. I suspect this will change in time as classic style servers keep bringing in meaningful money but it's just sad during the evolutionary state. 
---
We pay the monthly sub, spare me the rhetoric that "classicwow is free, you're paying for retail". That logic loop is cute, but in a customer / provider relationship it's pathetic at best. I unequivocally pay for classicwow and classicwow only. 
---
The lawyer speak is literally tiresome, I feel like it actually drains me when I read it. I can almost envision this blue poster typing the message with a shit eating grin when they typed "phase 2 isn't a patch because we can turn things on in the game" while they whispered "gottem" under their breath.
---
Almost the entire community that posts on forums / social media thought either DM was a technical patch or that obviously at the very least the official phase 2 was. This is just goofy to remotely pretend like the entire community is wrong here. If you're some kind of technical specialist that has the technical definitions of hotfix, versus patch, versus whatever DM/Phase 2 is apparently, I don't care, you're not Blizzard, and they didn't communicate it.
---
They can do whatever they want, but I lose confidence... that I never had to begin with... that they could ever remotely pull of a classic+ with this kind of attitude.
---
What do they respond with as a follow up? "By the end of the year" I almost had to catch myself from saying oh but do they mean fiscal year? It's just sad.
---
Be honest, did you lose the key ring code and have to rebuild it? That's cool, I'll wait 6 months complaint free if you tell me it's 6 months and commit to it. This lack of clarity, lack of commitment strategy isn't a strategy, it's incompetence.
---
You'll get bonus points for Blackhand Doomsaw. Not BIS but it looks awesome with T2.
---
What incentive is there for a guild to bring someone along who has shit gear and also doesn't have money to spend on upgrades? They don't carry their weight and they aren't paying other people to carry them.
---
No ret aura doesn't, but yes it does work. You can out heal any damage as the best solo target healer in the game. By the time you get some t2 pieces your melee +righteous will kill everyone, while they can't tickle you. You'll have trouble with every caster but that's a given, at least you have ele auras, most melee will lose to you every time.
---
There’s a buff cap of I believe 32?
---
Good idea. Compare the metrics a bit. Think it exists a timeline you should be /played for each level?
---
Rogues get their shit kicked by shadow priests. No question
---
You think this doesn't work in a duel? What are you gonna do aoe fear the moment you 'feel' the rogue near you in stealth?
---
The dude you are healing getting kills counts on you *as I've read*
---
Find yourself a couple warrior etc and let the annihilation begin.
---
Nope, you're very wrong. And seeing as your argument is "I'm right because I say", we're done here. You have a good one.
---
These actually work with our core group just fine. 
---
We at most have 1 guest or initiate in raid, the rest being people who show up regularly every week. Certain class groups, like warriors, have set up a priority system on items for prot spec'd players, so we don't have the issues of "loot leaving our raid group" or "the tank is under geared."
---
This could work for pugs, but please don't dismiss it as ineffective in a core group. You don't have to spend hours tracking points or running a spreadsheet. Our raid gets geared without the favoritism and drama of an elitist loot council too.
---
Private server cores are full of abusable bugs.
---
Me and my wife joined a guild of only people from RL at the start of classic. While we two actively progressed through the game our GM (neighbour in RL!) never got past 45 and has been neglecting Classic and guiding our guild towards end-game content. 
---
So when my wife and I were approached by an active raiding guild, we explained what we were looking for in classic, which isn‘t being the only 2 active members most of the time. We left the guild and joined the new guys, and it‘s so much better!
---
We still meet up regularly in RL with our former GM, but we don‘t talk about WoW. We also made it clear he doesn’t have to stick around for us and neglect whatever else he’d rather play. Some people lose interest and others move on.
---
That's true, but that is a pretty recent addition.
---
ClAsSiC wAs AbOuT tHe StRuGgLe!
---
For the immediate future, around BRM and then TM/SS are going to be clusterfucks.  Those are probably going to be the main hotspots for people trying to get larger scale pvp going.
---
One issue people overstate is going to be roving ganksquad killing level 50s.  If you are 60, anyone under like 57/58 gives an extremely minor amount of honor so ganking them is less about honor and more about being an ass.  This means it would happen regardless of the honor system.
---
I would try to avoid Searing Gorge/BUrning Steppes/Hillsbrad for the time being though.
---
There are 2 stops i think in between the 2
---
You will be.. You will be
---
Didnt know this was a thing. Will be getting it when I get home. 
---
Does it have an annoying ui?
---
that's the master's retreat where you summon your eye of kilrog and toy with people from a safe location
---
He can go in stealth but will be revealed once the dot tick hit.
---
Good rogues will have restorative potions to remove your dots if they need to escape but most people don't bother with consums.
---
Your best bet to kill a rogue is to manage in any way you can to get a death coil, then you can fear him away and stack dots. At that point it's pretty much over for the rogue. A rogue will do everything he can to never let you play as 3 dots is all it takes to kill him most of the time.
---
They do more damage, but are easily pulling aggro and forcing healer too oom healing them and the tank. It's not impossible to do, however.  Please get stamina on your stuff if you are going to do this as a mage.
---
As a mage...at 55 i feel safe, i beat half of the lvls 60 i duel in front of IF, lose only to 60 mages and locks, beat a few rogue warrior and hunters, death ray is so cool, i gotta respec to pom pyro
---
If i want to kill bael'gar in BRD, what is the most efficient run to join/advertise without having to clear the whole thing?
---
Goddamnit Rsn
---
why would they want him back on the team? he is no longer a big deal now that the 60 race is far behind, he isnt exactly good at endgame either
---
I'll be honest... I don't get it
---
&gt; borderline psychopathic vengeful nerds 
---
For.. not liking those who are selfish dicks and steal loot in a loot based game because they have no respect for anybody else? For seeing those people suffer the consequences of their own actions and being happy? 
---
Yeah.. such monsters.
---
My side buttons I have set bound to ctrl+1, ctrl+2, ctrl+3, etc. 
---
A macro can be set with /macro. It's a tool in the game that allows you to build actions and assign them to buttons. I.E I have my Shadow Word: Pain set to max rank with a button, then if I hold shift and press the same button its rank 1, or If I am healing a dungeon I've dealt with to many tanks that don't let me drink I have a /p Need to drink /y need to drink (this says in party and yell so it comes on their screen) at the same time and I don't need to type it. The cancel aura macro I handed to all my raid tanks when I healed. /cancelaura power word: shield what this does is if a priest hits them with a shield, they can cancel it around 50% hp or when they are comfortable to resume rage generation. It just removes the buff of the shield, very handy for tanks.
---
Usually dual wield to make use of your +10% increase on 1h weapons. Stance depends on the fight: solo usually battle stance, and bers/defensive depends on your healers quality: berserker gives you most rage, but dying sucks
---
google it.
---
You are charging to your target. %100 mount is crucial for who farms mines &amp; herbs and people who tries to run away from enemies.
---
Arugal has a lot of bots. Go to the Southern Side of Azshara and there are either 50-55 bots killing the hippogryph type mobs all day, and I've seen a 60 dwarf hunter bot farming the elite dragonkin nearby as well for 12+ hours. On top of that I'm sure half the herbalists are botting too.
---
Yeah... maybe.  They have lots of other good players though, why fund a guy who stirs up shit?
---
Bro, get your epic mount. You are going to be camped by the whole world.
---
I would get the mount before a crafted item, personally. Lionheart is amazing for threat if/when you go fury prot for BwL and on, but the epic mount will make getting gold that much faster (at least however you make gold out in the world) also make getting to dungeons faster and improve your overall QoL
---
Annihilator proccrate is really bad.
---
I'm struggling to even find groups on Pagle Horde.  I know I missed the big leveling rush but I'm a 57 priest healer that's pretty good at what I do.  I've tried a few different guilds but even in those with 30-40 people on at a time, nobody wants to run anything.  I advertise myself in LFG, wait for hours for one group to ask for a healer just to get a single run in for the night.  It's fucking miserable right now.  How do people ever get geared up?  I see all the same stuff on here.  Find a guild, be social, blah blah blah.  I do all this and none of it works.  Is everyone just done with BRD, DM, etc already?
---
What is “HWL”
---
The point is, ih he changed the rules mid raid ald really nijaed he could earn a ban form blizzard. If I remember correctly they ban changing loot rules to scam other ppl.
---
Like you said, the honer tab was already in the game just like the keyring should have been.  Both are interface elements.
---
I'm also a developer.  It's embarrassing since there have been several patches already to classic and have already admitted they are having difficulty with the keyring(back when they said it would come with the "first patch") but it's clear they can't quite figure out how to handle it in there mashup of retail client/backend &amp; vanilla(which they shouldn't be struggling with or they changed their mind on when to release it and don't have the balls to say anything, which is something blizzard has done in the past).
---
Lol, Reddit loves when people literally neuter themselves and murder babies via abortion.
---
Hi, /u/Jangonett11

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dwa65w/me_as_a_paladin_in_wpvp/). 
---
Not really, looks kind of the warrior stances, with 5 Icons, 1 to dismiss All, and 1 for every Totem typ. Can be moved with /TotemDismiss locked
---
Got my engi invis trinket and loads of anti cc pots and invis pots lol, 1 move speed trink, ice reflector, 100 thorium grenade, im as ready a lvl 55 can be
---
You’ll miss on loot too if you’re dead IRL ... it seems exagerate but a 30 years old died of it recently in the starcraft scene. Geoff / incontrol if you want to check. Blood cot are not a joke
---
Even with threat reduction I sit with the locks, It really depends how hard I am going. If i didn't put points in it I would blow by the locks. Mind blast is stupid high for threat gen.
---
I'll message you a good tip. ;)
---
or.. just do dungeon runs? like, yourself with a group?  
---
That being said I tanked in dungeons while leveling so maybe I'm stuck to a different mindset of the time it takes to find a group..
---
Not to be a 1 upper, but that's nothing.
---
Back in Vanilla I was the first priest in my guild to farm the eye, and the last one to get the one from Domo. Took around 6 months, the 1st one that dropped was won by a shadow priest. People were more excited than on our 1st Rag kill when I won that eye. I was the healing officer too so I couldn't even allowed to pull a power move and complain until it was given to me.
---
Still kind of salty about that 15 years later.
---
We have a hilarious issue of having about 3 each of druid/rogue/warrior, so of course we are drowning in Cenarion/Nightslayer/Might.  Meanwhile we have fucking 9 mages and barely get shit for them (Yes Arcanist is ass, but other stuff as well).  We have an inverse relationship between how much of something we take and how much of their shit we get.
---
There are a couple weird things you can do.  Loot is seeded when the instance opens, and the only really effective way the game can create the seed randomly is based off time.  Typically this would go down to a millisecond level and you couldn't really cheese it like this, but people have been fucking with it for years as a conspiracy theory.  Have a different Raid leader when you zone in!  Zone about 20 minutes earlier to get a different seed!
---
It is what it is and overtime you will see a broader range of stuff, but it's those streaks at the start which drive you crazy.
---
No one is saying treat everything as gold. Only boes worth 50g+. The attitude that is actually greedy is thinking you are entitled to the hundreds of gold that just dropped because you can use that particular item.
---
Thank goodness for Alliance love on Skeram, lord knows you're going to need it after the phase today.
---
No it's just a stereotype of women that like to complain to the manager
---
OP didn't come looking for help, he came to complain that it's the game balance that is inherently wrong. You can't help someone if they've already dismissed the *possibility* that the problem could be on **their** end.
---
You are not too late to join, but 1h a night max sounds like a bad fit. Better to spend it on other games which offer more short-term enjoyment.
---
I'm also a warrior but my advice might not be accurate for you. Every server is different of course. Anyway, I have an epic mount but I've also been farming in prot spec because I don't have a good pvp weapon yet. It's less about getting ganked and more about not being able to fight back. This gnome warrior kept stealing my rich thorium nodes because he was able to 1v1 me easily. If it didn't seem like I was going to contest it, however, he left me alone. If you can't beat someone in pvp then yeah they're going to take your shit every time.
---
I just use a raid frame with healcomm library support.
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/aptechka](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/aptechka)  This is the one I use if anyone interested.
---
Tbh the only downside for me is that you can't carry a PVP utility offhand like Skull of Impending Doom etc in your offhand. The staff does look cooler though.
---
Anyone in range of you can dismount with you a discombobulator ray, having an epic mount doesn't add much extra security. Gear &gt; mount in my mind, no exceptions.
---
New gender neutral priest quest.
---
The quest doesnt assume you as priest/priestress anymore.
---
I got stuck in there once and ended up eventually jumping out. It’s possible.
---
Just make a group to kill him. He's got like 4-5 packs between him and the entrance of the dungeon and that's literally it.
---
Bael'gar is very close to the entrance. If you want to specifically farm him, then find a couple friends willing to help you. 
---
Apart from that, you might try to join arena/angerforge/golemlord groups asking them for the short detour. With a full lvl 60 party, you should only need to kill a handful of trash to reach Bael'gar
---
People are going so insane over something that save them a woolen bags worth of slots...
---
Not sure if  it's what the other guy is thinking about, but he certainly tries to come across as a person that knows a lot about the game, yet in reality he is saying so hilariously many things that are just downright wrong. He is Classics equivalent of a flat earther.
---
I honestly can't fathom playing with people who think that an item is "meant to be sold". Who decided it was "meant" to be sold? It only *can* be sold, there's a big difference. 
---
But whatever, people can be as self centered as they like I guess. My guild everyone falls over themselves to give things to the people who can use them the most. I've so far been present for two Compendiums in Dire Maul. They were both, without question, given to the tanks in the run. The last one I saw sold went for over 4k... whatever. Don't care, I'd rather see the people I play with get awesome gear.
---
cannibalize+eat+drink all in one - it's a beautiful thing and restores health so quickly
---
Wooot! As someone trying to keep adons to minimum I was super sad to see it gone, without any reason or comment. 
---
Gonna definitely give it a try. Thanks!
---
...because it's gross to smoke indoors and get yellow stains on everything leading to cancerous carpet, curtains, walls, etc.
---
mageblade is much better
---
Enter from searing, jump into the lava, climb out, walk into BRD. You avoid the BRS entrance at least, but still expect a ghost walk or two as entrances are guarded (main and MC)
---
more like month and month. I do expect BWL in January or February.
---
&gt; I'd say that the majority, atleast over half of potential guilds would not care at all,

And if I saw him join a new guild, I would personally contact the GM of the guild (or at the very least officers) and explain the ordeal. If they then give the impression that they don't care about it, I would then refuse to group up with people from that guild. I would then clearly explain to each affected member of the guild the reason as to why I won't include them in my groups (for being in a guild that has no problem being associated with a blatant ninja-looter for example).
---
It's so annoying how these guilds are acting like a trinket is the thing that will be the difference between a wipe or not. If shit like that is the reason for a wipe, then I regret to inform guilds that it probably means they suck. 
---
You are so right, though. We all have to check these boxes before going to the next raid or phase, and honestly, it makes the game not even feel like a game. It makes the game feel like a freakin' second job. That's why I say screw all that, when I log on I want to do what I want to do. My guild gets annoyed with me because they want me at level 60 (I'm almost level 59) to join raid, and last night they were like, "What are you doing right now? Questing? Trying to grind up to 60 quick?", and I just went, "Nah, I'm in Un'Goro killing Alliance.". They're like "For fucks sake, honor isn't even out yet.". I laughed saying, "Bro, I literally just got home from work. I've got an hour and a half before I hit the sack, I'm gonna spend it having fun.".
---
My brother has a warrior, and gets annoyed with the "check all the boxes" mentality too. He keeps seeing all the warriors in leather and even with daggers. He was like, "Fuck that, I'm a warrior. If I wanted to be a rogue, I'd start a rogue. I wear plate and smash people with my big fuckin' axe.".
---
He probably won't be invited to raids with the neckbeard, circle-jerkin', gear clones, but he wrecks in world PvP with me. It all comes down to having fun, though.
---
Dual wield, I have my off-hand and my shield side-by-side on a side bar so I can quickly swap as needed. 
---
For most battles, I'll be in battle stance while dual wielding. For bosses, I don't normally dual wield unless I'm either trying to gain a ton of threat or I'm not the MT, in which case I'll go defensive for the first scenario and berserker for the second one.

Open up with a macro for pet attack (mine is on immolate), put dots on, death coil into a shadow bolt, and finish it with shadowburn. Pvp is ezpz against anyone other than priests
---
.....Ya nothing wrong with being unable to support yourself and needing to rely on others as a fully capable adult. Wait, I think I just defined "useless".
---
Well said.
---
Good idea, doesn’t work
---
Yup, there's no way he could go to the Southsea Pirates and have the place to himself. It's never ever empty on any server.
---
KEKW
---
Exactly, there is none, why bring that person?
---
&gt; but I've saw some clips of him naming items from just seeing them on someones character, where they drop from, what boss etc.
---
.....
---
This used to be normal.
---
For context, in order to skip having to wait for rag RP, speedruns send one player ahead of time to start the encounter so that the raid can engage the boss immediately upon arrival. Atleast that's the idea...
---
You think I care about reputation on US server?  hah hah hah
---
P6 of TBC, that is.
---
It is, but in a guild you don't really have an option to get a mageblade for everyone so some people will have to settle for the staff.
---
Ehh, did they not said something like there will not be a down time between p1 and p2? The switch is only server side and not on the cliant as far as I know.  So noone will be logged out a d there will not be down time
---
I can definitely make judgements about where their dungeons, quests, and hubs are without playing them, thanks. No need to get so defensive lol.
---
Ah okay, forgive my scepticism then. That sounds indeed like either some really desperate people or, in fact, bots. Normally you'd be wearing the staff that gives you underwater breathing while doing this tho, or getting endless breath from a WL (if you're not one yourself). But "people" just outright drowning over and over really sounds like it's bots since they don't have to care about that kinda setback (corpserun).
---
An exaggeration.
---
Could you elaborate on the 4 player vs 5 player group a bit? I have been doing this exact method with 5 (myself playing a 60 mage + alt, and 3 randoms I get from world chat). Never thought about checking 4 man vs 5 man xp. Just automatically assumed 5 would be best.
---
Hold on, there's people on this sub rn who don't realize he ninja'd the staff to get out of his Method contract and get free publicity at the same time?
---
This is a troll era, doing provocative things for attention is the name of the game.
---
The staff has already paid for itself.
---
Let me know if they're any issues. They worked fine for me the last two nights in raids, but this is my first time publicly publishing anything so anything could go wrong!
---
Ni hao
---
It could. At the very least people there would be a bit more new people joining the lower pop faction as it's easier to get in on that server
---
I don't see an issue with it either personally. But I know pretty much every issue with DKP I hear being brought up involving hoarding points.
---
As a ret paladin where I think I only have flameguard, onslaught and QSR to bid on outside of weapons it keeps me pretty high on the priority list.  I got our first onslaught belt last night and I am still second priority amount melee dps.  I could definitely see some feathers getting ruffled if I bid on something juicy in the near future.  Though we did pretty much agree that the first 2 OEBs would go to our arms warriors and I will get the Earthshaker.  Being a team player is still a very big part of making any loot system work.
---
The difference is I'll still take a competing class. If I get a bunch of whispers at once, I'll just take the non-competing ones first.
---
This is a terrible system; I'd be fine with it for PUGs but even then there are better rules. Definitely not anything I'd do with a guild, this is even worse than LC.
---
I agree vanilla from the hit and have been playing classic since release.  Ive never had someone steal from crafting or enchanting.
---
I'd maybe be a little cautious if your server currently has free transfers, but, your rep follows you when locked to a single server.
---
Could be fucking around even if it's not yet cleared.
---
That seems way more reasonable, to me at least
---
:D I'm big dumb tank. But I'm not THAT dumb! ;)
---
I dont get it...
---
You did flame, let's call a spade a spade mate. 
---
And yeah, re the loot method, obviously we disagree. 
---
It's pointless to talk about Onslaught. Why point out one guild that is having trouble with a method? We both know thats indicative of the guild and not the method.
---
I could give you examples of how LC ripped apart guilds too right? Does it mean LC is inherently bad?
---
At the end of the day, argument for Loot Council is items go to players who deserve them to help push progression.
---
Argument for Loot List is clear and free, transparent loot arranged by members.
---
The former is more authoritarian and dicator-like. Doesn't mean its bad. Just means council decides on its own. Guildies have no input. There's simply too many flaws with Loot Council. So many issues of Council favouring people over others. No transparency. 
---
Regular players, even good ones, can come to resent loot council and not feel like they matter.
---
That's why Loot List is the best. Loot is clearly and evenly distributed. Its transparent, publicly visible. Classes can work out amongst themselves. Although leaders will still rule on issues, by and large, people feel like they have freedom of choice, and you also get none of the currency issues that DKP has.
---
IMO, the "progression" monopoly that LC has is overblown. guilds will continue ripping apart raids in Classic, and its simply better to be in a loot system that is clear, transparent, and that the players have say over.
---
What's the actual time required for this mount? I feel like so many grinds in this game are overhyped by rose tinted glasses from the perspective of when people were 12 year olds playing Vanilla.
---
You're not very good at English, are you?
---
I know a lot of people who left trade chat the instant they entered a city, and never rejoined. They just hate the spam.
---
He and his dad defrauded a construction company with a contract of $1mil+ and did zero work on the project.
---
You need to drink every 2-3 pulls, but so do most casters if they want to deal high damage. You don't need to build up resources before/during the pull so your threat is at the max when you pull, you need about half a consecrate duration and then DPS can go nuts.  It is fun, but you only have a soft taunt with Judgement or BoP if things go south.
---
if it was a quest item...you can just abandon the quest and go redo it. I gather you might not want to do that, but you shouldn't have deleted it in the first place.
---
The wiki isn't the only source and all the other sources back up the wiki. There are videos and screenshots from September, October, and December 2005, as well as archived comments from Thottbot and Allakazam(sp) talking about the new looks coming in 1.9 as well as an archived post on the official website talking about the sets finally being updated to the new looks. There are even screenshots from Blizzcon where they previewed it in October. Honestly, this is getting into flat earther level of denial.
---
A poor side effect of the “roll for loot” system is that some people can be extremely lucky and others can be extremely unlucky and never win rolls. Our guild is working VERY well with a rotating loot council. We have 4 constant officers on the council and 10 random raiders every week are chosen to distribute loot. We’ve had times where players will tie with votes and have a roll-off for the winner. The system is pretty much fool proof and nobody has complained about a decision because everybody gets a say.
---
Warrior
---
You can finish it in 1.5 with full group of 60 geared but for the normal group I say 2 hours will be miracle, closer to 3
---
My guild is doing a wishlist system similar to this https://www.feverclan.com/forums/threads/list-system-our-classic-wow-raid-loot-distribution.139771/
---
&gt; Some streamer ninja looted something and people, even though they claim that they dont care about streamers whine about how awful he is. 
---
Well, it would help if you didn't generalize everyone to have the same opinion. Some people are annoyed about the ninja'ing itself, whereas others are annoyed about the behaviour said person exhibits afterwards, which can be seen as rather toxic.
---
Warriors get all the chicks.
---
I either vendored or disenchanted my Skull of Impending Doom AND disenchanted the Orb of Soran'ruk on my lock (off-hand good for a number levels) because I blindly used a disenchat addon. Don't remember when I vendored/DE'd the Skull, but it would be useful to speed up solo dungeon runs.
---
Why would you make a reddit thread instead of entering "asmongold how to ninja loot" on youtube? Took me literally 5 seconds to find it.
---
Yeah honestly you're almost always better taking every single upgrade you can find and leaving others to horde DKP for the single "best" item... the guy with every other slot filled with "almost as good" items is gonna do better every time. 
---
Too many people fall in to the trap of assuming something "has to drop" sooner or later. Nope. Some things will drop every week, some you will never ever see.
---
Blizzard has never done anything about ninja looters.
---
Hey bird how's it going? I like your feathers they look really great! So you're a bird right, what's that all about? Ok, well it was great to meet you. Say hi to your mother for me.
---
Can’t get camped if you never leave instances.. that’s my plan as someone in your exact situation 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
could just not announce when you are getting the buff so the entire server doesn't show up
---
I am going to be leveling alts for the next little while (my main is 43)
---
Thanks :)) will give a few of those a go
---
Haha, sure was! :)
---
Literally had someone in our guild leave becouse of this item. He couldn't accept the fact that DPS were given prio on the item instead of healers. Some people... /smh
---
Seems like a really grounded guy
---
I believe that's retail travel form, with a glyph or something.
---
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
---
Looks ng at all the pvp arena competition and official tournaments and player hosted tournaments wondering yeah you are right
---
They kinda have the code already with the herb bags. Just gotta change size, and herbs to keys, right? Then they have to pop it in the UI wich may be somewhat harder but I doubt it tbh
---
While I generally agree, do be careful about it. I've had several people shame me in general chat because they didn't agree with me. Some people literally think they deserve everything and when they don't get it they shame you. Even had someone blackmail me (and the whole group) - give him the item or he would "ruin my rep". Group leader was his friend, so not able to kick him.
---
So while sure, spread word of wrong doings - don't believe it unless you actually have evidence. People can be dickheads.
---
&gt; WoW was never a PvP game
---
ok boomer.
---
I played wow for 6 years solid and it was really hard to quit. How is the new classic wow for people?
---
There are a ton of people I know with 25-30 days played it’s disgusting lol. I’m 60 with decent gear and have 14 days and that’s far too much play time and I’ve been cutting back.
---
We need more soliders on Skeram!
---
I'm sorry, you missed out on one of the craziest, memorable, frustrating and entertaining things I have ever experienced in gaming... Shit it even ranks up there in IRL memories
---
lol. Real class act he is. 
---
Hope he loses all his viewers.
---
So under good conditions, you assemble a group the same way reserve group does.  Under less desirable, you’ll take someone out of necessity.  
---
Again, how is this any different than a normal reserve group?  Adding the qualifier that if you absolutely have to, you will bring a competing class doesn’t change much.
---
As an explanation why Atlasloot confuses so many players:
---
There are two blue pvp sets, the original set, which was released with the honor system and an upgraded version, which replaced the original set in 1.11.
---
Atlasloot only knows the upgraded set and classic will only feature the upgraded set and as that was added in 1.11, Atlasloot tags it as phase 6.
---
well, murder is a part of the world too, doesn't mean we have to condone it or not do our best to stop it and penalize it.
---
&gt; I just disagree with the nototian that a fuck up is a fuck up regardless of the situation that's presented to them.
---
It's not about being a fuckup, though - that might be why you disagree.
---
Look, there's a thread here about a guy - JokerD - who was/is a streamer (somewhat famous, as far as I know). Just recently he led a pug and he ninja'd the staff of dominance in MC. 
---
Was he a fuckup? I wouldn't know, I assume he wasn't - as far as I know, famous streamers can make quite a bit of money. However, once the opportunity presented itself, he did act like an asshole. So now he's somewhat screwed, as method suspended him and he might be facing some unpleasant consequences related to what he did.
---
My point isn't that he was always a fuckup. My point is that he was always an asshole - he just lacked the opportunity to prove that to the whole world. As soon as the opportunity presented itself, he grabbed it (by the pussy, nevertheless) and he fucked up. 
---
You've got people who grow up in poverty, sometimes orphaned as well. They study, they work, they do whatever they can to succeed - and sometimes they do; sometimes they become superstars. Sometimes they become super rich.
---
Then you've got people who grow up in modest families, but not poor; their parents are still around - they might not be perfect, but they're around. They go out "with the guys", they steal a car and the next thing you know, they're in jail. Fuckups.
---
That's pretty much how things are with wow. It's just an amplifier, really - for your character. You don't play wow 20 hours a day for 3 years because it's addictive. It's boring as fuck. You play wow for 20 hours for 3 years (or more) because you never had any desire to study or work or achieve something. That's all there is to it. Pointing to some random modest accomplishment (yeah, X had straight A's in English before WoW) is misleading at best.
---
Raiding faction cities isn't the "world pvp" i'm talking about. I'm talking about the skirmishes in hillsbrad and the likes. Those will surely die once battlegrounds come out because they hillsbrad will no longer be the best source of honor.
---
Also, raiding faction cities will be way less prevalent with the introduction of the honor system due to DHK's
---
25% is good in the live game where it's 5 items for 20 players.
---
Vanilla had a ratio closer to 6 items for 40 people.
---
Dude straight up allowing his nuts to get nuked by AOEs.
---
10 Days in game as in 240 hours?
---
Damn, what drama was that? Must have been pretty serious to kill the guild.
---
People who've farmed up thousands of gold...what are you doing with it all?  What gold sinks are you putting it towards?
---
Uh. It's not up the community to exile thieves in RL. We have law enforcement and a justice system for that.
---
All this over taking an item? Sheash. Either im extremely out of the loop or this whole thing is childish. Its just a virtual item. Where am I going wrong?
---
I would like to believe this is real but i cannot. I meanthe story is ok.. but that it was jokerd? damn
---
I'm hoping my server will be fine. It's not a mega server so we will see.
---
Same here. I'm just glad that the only item I really give a shit about is the leaf.
---
Yes, because it's 2004 and there are no girls on the internet.
---
Just to confirm, I can run in, die, then just rez up into the instance entrance right?  Aint nobody got time for this (until im 60 and bored).
---
Damn .. why would they remove fun skill interactions like this? Makes me sad
---
Yall are doing it wrong just get a significant other who is also addicted
---
Go farm your prebis! Questing is fun, but you’ll get good loot and xp in dungeons too and you’ll be avoiding the massive war that’s about to take place :)
---
Paladin with a warrior is an amazingly devastating combo.  I was a paladin through vanilla and far and away my favorite part of the game was pvping.  I never went in for the r14 grind, but I'd do a little bit each day.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503122521051-0502510303
---
That's the spec I used most of the time.  Redoubt and shield spec are great for dealing with rogues/warriors.
---
The first thing is to actually wear plate and a shield.  This is the biggest advantage a paladin has in pvp.  Even in blues, a paladin will have much more health/armor than priest and druids healing.  It is difficult for rogues/hunters to burst down paladins, and bubble makes it difficult for casters to just blow you up.  In the time it takes someone to take the paladin out of the fight, a good warrior with have fucking destroyed them.
---
You should be running conc aura and have concentration so you dont get any pushback.  If anyone wants to stop you from casting you have to get CS/Kick/Pummeled.  CS the most dangerous not only because it is the longest, but a mage will have an easier time killing you than a rogue/warrior.  The great advantage of being a paladin is far too often rogues/warriors will just ignore you since you can be so difficult for them to kill.  Mages are the big concern.
---
Holy Light is always a dangerous thing to cast because of how easy it is to spell lock, but it's great.  I'd advise making a DF/Holy Shock macro because DF can be purged.  Make sure you pay attention to your other casters for when for BOP and your warrior/rogues for when to freedom them.  Freedom especially is the most powerful thing a paladin brings.  If there are good shaman, then it should be purged quickly, but many priests fail to use their dispel offensively.  With a solid warrior, giving him freedom just ends the life of any mage in the area.  Hey cool, let's have a death machine that can't be snared!
---
In PvP, paladins really get to get the field generals their mythology suggests they should.  They are difficult options for physical dps to try to kill while providing immense protection for their allies.  If you are ignored, your team wins because you will keep them alive.  If you are focused, you have a good chance of winning because of how long you can draw out your own death.
---
Was waiting for it
---
Yeah I definitely had almost full t2 on my druid before aq came out but I didn't have any before bwl (just t1 mostly for me at that point). Always only been moose model for me.
---
Yup, came across one in Arathi last night on Windseeker. Fem dorf hunter with a gibberish name.
---
It most likely does, but a WEAPON!!! is surely more important, right? RIGHT?
---
Only 60g? Lucky you lol
---
i cant watch this at work, but a  1v1 mage has advantages over a rogue but 2v1 this should be a no brainier as the first can open and get blink and possibly IB both on CD and then the mage is just dead to the 2nd rogue with no issues
---
Just type pshero on YouTube or watch his stream on twitch.
---
Seems like a chill guy
---
Lol who would take a mage blade when you snag that sick staff off Kelthuzad!?
---
Me. This is an ROLE playing game after all
---
Damn they removed such a fun skill interaction. Sucks man, makes me sad.
---
I feel I am at the stage at 52 where people want to run dungeons to get BIS but don’t want lowbies to slow the runs down, saying that I haven’t tried too hard to find groups yet, still trying to quest as much as possible until it lands
---
4
---
Some of the originals actually look amazing imo.
---
Would've or would have
---
SURELY! Ngl I do like getting the AP buff in DM and just going melee mage
---
No one is announcing, everyone keeps track of the cd. No need for announcing really, there's always someone ready to pop it.
---
Unfortunately, his Twitch chat were supporting and encouraging his behavior. I don't think they're going anywhere - in fact, he'll probably **gain** viewers from this whole fiasco.
---
Christ, the Twitch community is awful.
---
Nobody wants to share their investment strategy for fear of competition, you won't get a straight answer in this thread. Check out r/woweconomy for some tips.
---
Ah, I see :) thanks
---
I really think giving people the chance to do it is as you said, part of the game and the universe. As the other comment says, it would fucking awesome to have the possibility to kill players (same faction, inside cities/sanctuaries, etc) and have a whole system surrounding all of it. It would be seen as a deplorable practice like ninja looting, but would create an interesting dynamic of "freedom and realism" like a living enviroment and also as a social context and relationships between players. So yes, I completey agree with you!
---
Excellent ! Thank you very much for your time!
---
Jokerd, the guy that has lvl 60 1st world record on classic just ninja'd this staff last night, after the fact he was removed from Method's twitch team. He's probably goin to lose alot of money from streams over this so that's what OP is meaning with his title.
---
Everyone is still allowed to hate your guts for it
---
Nobody wrote survival hunter wrong.
---
Oh sorry, that was sarcasm, imo it is just as much PvP as it is PvE hence the option for either server. That's like saying "wow was never a roleplaying game" it is in fact, all of the above
---
To be fair, it's things like this that encourage people to talk with one another and share experiences to help each other out. I see it as part of an mmo.
---
When they intervene in a legitimate case, do they also take away the item from the culprit?
---
Other guy said you guys have a FP on the other side of town, tf you complaining for about then, any other area sure, but with the FP there and ally owning the fucking town id say you guys have it better..
---
Closest thing to the good ole days
---
How does that invalidate his comment? 
---
Are you saying that everyone who is on the subreddjt has no life?
---
No, he got a car, girlfriend, and a house only 3 hours after quitting wow. Definitely a true story
---
Mage // Telekinesis: 2 sec cast time - Loot all dead mobs in 10 yard range.
---
Which is common in business for "you are pretty much fired" at least in my experience.
---
I remember the name. We're on the server Faerlina. I play a druid Classifurry.
---
Ah yes you are right. Perhaps that was a bad analogy I used.
---
Yes, they do. Sometimes there are bans as well, but  not always.
---
I love when people say it unironically but then they start to believe their own bullshit, like they're above they're own stank.
---
Lets give them shadowcraft...but RED
---
In what world is losing a Method sponsorship worth the one week of extra publicity before he falls off the map again?
---
Protection Paladin tank can work. Bear Druid is really strong too, especially with so many people running AoE farm groups in dungeons. 
---
You almost certainly will not raid tank though on either class though, and will probably be healing if you wanna raid on them.
---
I've soloed the entire instance as a mage except for the boss encounters. Even scarlet packs of 4 are doable, it just gets slow waiting for cold snap(+plus rocket helmet/mind control helmet), so not really a viable way of farming
---
Ok. To make it more clear to you: you are citing the wrong part. 
---
u/ZCilian said Method kicked him from the * **streaming team** * which is correct. 
---
&gt; we have removed him effective immediately from our Twitch Team
---

Unrelated, but the term "toon" has always bugged me rather than "character" or something similar.
---
Blizzard has stated that multi-boxing is not a violation of ToS. You are paying for 4 accounts, and manually controlling all of them. Perfectly legit.
---
Anyone that picks Nelf prepares for defeat.
---
Absolutely!
---
We had a Surger doing this last night!
---
Why is Joker even on Method? He's not a world first raider, Blizzcon PVPer, and his stream isn't that popular outside of the time he hit 60. Are they even getting anything from him?
---
This guy sounds like a future mass shooter.
---
Epic Mount first of all. Then all the BIS epics I can make or buy. I'm not in a raiding guild so I may look around for guilds that raid during times that fit my schedule and ask to buy gear pieces. I'm a priest and I really want to make benediction again in Classic so securing an Eye of Divinity would be worth quite a bit of gold to me.
---
So then why are people shitting their pants so hard? He’s obviously a dickhead person from how he’s acting, but the game is full of them. But, he didn’t ninja shit.
---
This but caffeine addiction
---
I would recommend getting the mount before the gear. I bought mount before lionheart and it was absolutely the right choice - if you’re actually playing the game and not afking in major cities you are constantly on your mount - going 40% faster is comparable to the difference between walking and the slow mount..
---
I'm not sure what to use.
---
I have the latest version of vuhdo, which says switched to the "4.0" version or whatever.
---
Do I download this too and put it in addons?
---
Energy management is a lot more complicated than you think.
---
I'm low 40s and 7 hour levels are insanely fast for me Haha. And that's WITH quest tracker. I feel like I run around for about half the time(often in ghost form). But what's the rush eh?
---
Just play a plate class if you hate them that much!
---
Provide actual info and screenshots and resubmit. You put 0 effort in creating the ticket.

---
Most of the time I don't use stealth when grinding on my rogue. Waste of time.
---
Thanks! I hope so. Luckily I have a lot less time to spend which hopefully will mean most of my time is spent doing dungeons and raids. Still gotta farm for more arcane crystals tho!
---
You can't be an alcoholic without alchohol. You can be something else but it wouldn't be an alcoholic.
---
Not really. As an ele, you want to stack as much SP as possible and as enh you’re pretty much gearing like a DPS Warrior. With downranking available to you there isn’t much reason to justify MP5 in most cases.
---
If you support ninjaing, please post your toons name and server. 
---
Now you have your answer.
---
Horde are more active near everlook than gadgetzan on my server
---
What a surprise? Blizzard rush things out to print money, so weird.
---
I have been on the fence about pservers compared with classic because it's really not the same technical challenge for them as it is for blizzard (if you want more Intel there are good highly down voted comment with explanation).
---
But I wasn't aware of nostalrius website to promote classic and wasn't neither aware that they basically stop their server because classic was coming.
---
So I understand the backlash against blizzard and why people find that comparing the two is relevant. those pservers guys work their ass off for this to happen and when you see the end result it's disgusting.

Holy reckoning build
---
heal yourself and allys- get 5 stacks- one shot horde
---
Fixed in a patch few days ago :)
---
well, axually, she gave the ultimatum already, indirectly
---
PVP trinkets.
---
When I first started playing I thought higher armor = less damage taken = upgrade and needless to say my shaman was weak af and had the dumbest gear known to man kind on it.
---
Who the fuck are you? lmao
---
Yeah mine doesn’t single me out she calls us all losers
---
Best of luck to all on Kromcrush.
---
POWER to the Forsaken!
---
Waiting until the first of the month.... Before you buy it?
---
big brains here nice
---
Cool!
---
Can you keybind the buttons? And does it track times on the icons like totemtimers?
---
You don’t actually believe this lol. This isn’t retail
---
None, this is just stupidity not understanding the way the world actually works and people thinking they have it figured out before they actually do.
---
I explained why Asmon is different to Jokerd, you said "this used to be normal" as if every single player knew every single bosses drop table and how it looks in game is "normal". 
---
I explained its impressive because there are literally THOUSANDS of unique items in the game which he can recall from memory and you say who cares, loads of people can do that?
---
Well those people don't have the other traits required to be a successful streamer, traits Asmon obviously has. I get the vibe you are quite salty and possibly jealous(?) of Asmongold? Like you could do a better job? Start up the stream then buddy, I'll be your first follower.
---
Feeling pretty down about it, since lvl 48 has pretty much no chance vs 60s . But we will see !
---
Whenever the next banwave is... It's almost 2020, how do you not know how this works yet? They don't individually ban bots, never have never will.
---
Good to know, thanks. Time to start making them again.
---
Healers be like [https://imgur.com/a/duwLC9e](https://imgur.com/a/duwLC9e)
---
Lower level groups doing prison/arena would probably be the most happy to
---
You can ping pretty much any run and ask if they are willing to kill him.  Even pure arena runs might be ok with doing it at the end of the last lockout(if your lucky they might bored enough to kill him each time).
---
Shame New Gen weren't there to lay down their corpses for Progress to walk all over
---
Okay i gotta have this
---
Glider is dead, Honorbuddy is dead, rebot is dead...what are they even using?
---
Not watching others play either but saw the post made by 1 of the raid members earlier today on the sub.
---
Once again? You’re condescending to this person and it doesn’t seem like you know them
---
Thinking you’re a veteran at the game by leveling to max... yikes.
---
What was unclear?
---
This is what happens. It’s ridiculous sometimes having to corpse hop 10 times to get into raid. Not even a point but to antagonize. I seriously kill any alliance on sight now after 6 weeks of the grizzly camp.
---
Friends or lackeys?
---
Drama is the best part of Classic tho
---
For sure, but that’s 5 minutes from the slowest the guide says, and 45 is a pretty decent group with probably no wipes.
---
Not to mention the inside of your computer, I used to work at a repair shop and anytime a smoker brought in their pc to get repaired I'd have to get a mask and gloves it was so disgusting
---
Trade Mats
---
Trade Item you want enchanted + tip
---
Done
---
You go to raid and aren't properly enchanted, geared or buffed then you deserve to be called out.
---
2H fury for Alliance is just...not very good...
---
I haven’t seen any #s that would point to a breakpoint where DW eclipses 2H fury as alliance, but I imagine the bar is low.
---
I believe you'll save 100g (as it's 10% on the original 1000g).
---
You can get rank 3 in a week if you are in the top approx. 5% of players. If you pvp 3-4 hours a day you should get there.
---
Otherwise it would take you two weeks.
---
Personally I'd just buy it as it will make your life a lot easier!
---
&gt; spamming racist shit in org and Coca cola got wind of it
---
You'd be banned long before lol. Racist bullshit is one of the most sure-fire ways to get the banhammer in pretty much any online setting.
---
I don't know that we'll be able to transfer servers anytime soon, but I don't blame you for wanting to try an alt on a pve server (just in case). Blizz hasn't released any information about when transfers may become available, unfortunately, but I don't see any harm in rolling up an alt. Depending on what your 60s are, you could try something new and/or roll a good farm class as an alt on this server.
---
As mentioned, healing dungeons is probably going to be your best bet. There's an add-on called Spy that will alert you to enemy players nearby, which will give you a chance to escape more easily. Make sure you have Nature's Grasp, I find just the talent itself is fine and don't need to take all 5 points, but ymmv. If you're struggling to escape and need to cast a heal, you can try to get them to blow their interrupt on you by casting Starfire. That'll lock out Moonfire, but if escaping is your goal then it's better than locking your nature spells and thus heals. Pop Swiftmend early (assuming you have it) so it comes off cooldown hopefully before they get you low again. Hope this helps. Good luck!
---
Ofc you are feeling good on golemagg on horde side because thats like a  70-30 horde server. I had to leave my lvl49 human warr on that server and reroll on zandalar tribe cuz it was unplayable.
---
Oddly enough the people who are raiding seem to think it's fair and they are the only ones who matter.
---
3 points in improved righteousness and no unyielding faith? 5 points wasted in imp blessing of might? neither imp hoj or imp conc aura? this is an atrocious spec man
---
Costs money, so yes as always you can do whatever you want if you can throw money at blizzard
---
I've earned maybe 5k gold so far in total. I've bought flasks and elixirs for the coming few months, epic mount, changed my profession to enchanting, bought items for my alt, respecced, bought righteous orbs to last me a few weapons etc. :)
---
Except they do fix bugs.
---
Then he finished his carrier for a "regular staff"? Replacement is not even in phase 5 or 6. Lol. What a failure.
---
Shit I wish blizzard paid me. Then I would probably have more time and not have to work as much.
---
&gt; You can't be an alcoholic without alchohol. You can be something else but it wouldn't be an alcoholic.

You also can't be addicted to having sex with more and more AND MORE women without women.

Let's ban women?
---
Looking forward to running 5 man rogue death squads in BRM.  One man on CS duty, one for the garrote, (hopefully) three on ambush.  Priests first priority, other clothies next.  If we are running majority combat, 5 man simultaneous blade flurry in a group is...well its something.  And before the "5 man anything is terrifying" comments, the difference here is that you can see them coming.
---
I think this is the first dungeon you’re really gonna feel not having a taunt.  You’ll find it easier with a tankier group.  It’s not such a big deal, but the mobs leading up to the final boss may be hard for you, especially if you have an over eager group.
---
wait, seriously? I can send level 60 greens to my level 1 enchanter alt, and he can DE it all? fuck me..
---
Classic wow only allows you to converse with people on your server and you can’t name change, normally at least. If you do something scummy, people know, word of mouth spreads. It’s very social and we recognize people quite easily. 
---
A lot of the warlocks in my server know each other by username and we’ve discussed some things while idling in ironforge, like what we see in AH or what gear setups we currently have. 
---
We especially know the ninjas, by name, so we don’t invite them to our groups. If you don’t know what a ninja is, it’s someone who swipes loot for themselves, whether or not they need it, out of pure greed. They won’t give a fair chance to others to loot it or they take it just to sell it when someone else could’ve used it. 
---
This player in method just got suspended for looting a raid drop staff (which isn’t even his best in slot) for himself without letting it go to roll for the rest of the raid who could’ve used it. He ninja’d.
---
Or may be don't do something like stealing?
---
Just checking, seen people say like “yeah she went for the free stuff didn’t sleep with the dude poor guy wasted 1K”
---
Are you serious?
---
I killed four of those hunters yesterday :)
---
Definitely not.  As someone who just aoe farmed a mage to 60 those spots are super contested.  My mage is alliance and I have a 60 horde that I would use to gank alliance in my farming spots but even then a lot of the time it would be crowded by horde.
---
They're both about equal.
---
Batting a thousand, nice work slugger.
---
Correct, it’s a massive error to assume that this staff isn’t incredibly rare
---
But that's 99% of the goal of this advertising.  When a streamer is sponsored by Corsair, Corsair doesn't think that streamer is going to convince you to buy a product.  They just know that when you finally want to buy something in the category that you are going to remember the name Corsair, cause you heard someone say it 500 times.
---
GDKP was huge in WoTLK in ICC.
---
Thats what I do lol
---
Detect invisibility doesn't work on stealth, genius.
---
we are clearing MC since week 1.
---
we have 2 benedictions in our raid -\_-
---
The honor system launches today.  Murder is going to he heavily incentivized.
---
have you heard the word?
---
Jesus christ can all the kids please shut up about insanely asinine shit.
---
PVE and PVP servers existed. Both PVE and PVP matter. Please stop treating the game is if its only a WPVP ganking lowbie fest.
---
Why the hell did I even waste my life clicking on this thread, and even so, writing this reply?
---
&gt; I'm also a developer
---
Press X to doubt
---
Yes I actually play with my wife she isn't someone to play games daily so she is just now lvl 10 but she has been enjoying the quest lines and actually takes time to learn and adapt to the world of Azeroth ;)
---
Come on over the Anathema, the lowest pop server! 17G black lotus, wide open AOE farms for any mage!
---
I doubt he cares about getting into raids, he's lost his livelihood right now, been kicked off his team, everyone hates him, he's losing subscribers to his twitch. This has cost him brand deals and collaborations, it could throw his whole life around... all for an MC staff that isnt even that great. jokerd more like just a joke.
---
LFM strat live farm for 5 hours. Everything reserved. Need tank &amp; healer.
---
I’ll plan to do that thanks!
---
Early druids were trash compared to warriors. The current version of tank druids is a vast improvement, compared to day one release Druid, which closes the gap a bit. Or so I’ve read
---
I don’t think he understands how the guy leveled... he abused layering and had entire zones to himself... 100% no other method is faster than that.
---
True, bad example, I was just trying to think of an obvious example of making the company look bad
---
now
---
Go in raw then
---
&gt; Only classes who would have bag/bank space problems are locks (soul shards) and warriors (having to carry multiple gear sets)
---
...and healers (the good healing gear doesn't buff spell damage) and other tanks (paladins and druids) and hunters (arrows)...
---
yeah he should have waited until Phase 3 for SSF at least!
---
You realize in OP's scenario, you'd be walking away with 350 free gold every week?
---
That means every pleb can afford maiden's circle/freezing band/arch mage robes etc. and still make incremental upgrades even if they don't win anything. The guild basically subsidizes and pays for everyone to get an upgrade.
---
Oh man I remember when Paladins were considered power rangers then were upset they got a dress.
---
I would say this counts as blizzard - an archive of their notes.

---
Uhhh no, AQ dropped in January of 2006, I knew people late November who had full t2, and it didn't look like the 'before' in op's post
---
You’re resto, though, right?
---
He just reinforced your point by saying that \*every\* large anti-cheat companies does this. It's the best way to ban bots, there's no debating it. :)
---
Game knowledge is obviously special, lets put it into context
---
There are 2 people who stream world of warcraft, one knows a lot about the game and is constantly flaunting his game knowledge to the stream so they are aware he knows what hes talking about
---
The other guy just plays the game and gets on with it, engages with the chat but doesn't share game knowledge or whatever
---
A new player is going to be drawn to person 1's stream over person 2, sure Person 2 may be just as entertaining but they will likely learn very little compared to watching Person 1.
---
This is why he's popular. The whole discussion is about why is he popular, I answered the question and then he cried that it wasn't good enough. I'm just saying the facts.
---
"no the clearly written history is wrong! My memory from a decade ago is more accurate"
---
Yes you can in vanilla. It was changed later (like in TBC?) as it was used by hackers to DE peoples gear and send the mats forward (nexus crystals from epics) - and account hacking back then was a serious problem.
---
I honestly have no idea what the logic at Blizzard is when shit like this happens.
---
But enemy players can't even see your buffs in classic.
---
Most of the armor models were updated before 1.9. This was just the patch where all the changes were finalized. You can see it in the patch notes.
---
&gt;Maxing blacksmithing (through AH) - 300g
---
I'm surpise it's so low, I'm around 250 and every craft is like 10 thorium or mithril. So it seems very expensive to reach 300, maybe I'm overestimating it in my head
---
It wasnt my own Group, but I was the healer
---
No I don't.  It's just one of those things I remember Blizzard mentioning years ago without specific information beyond that.  My PvPing was primarily WSG because OG AV was fucking awful and I never really liked AB.
---
You spelled chode wrong.
---
Sounds like Presidential material!
---
&gt;career
---
Idk if i'd go that far, but yeah, fuck boi lost a good chunk of income.
---
That's fair and I can see where you are coming from. I played Alliance from 2005 to 2010 (ish), and when I started playing again after a long break, I wanted to try the horde side. I played horde for about a year, just be aware that the culture and atmosphere is a bit different on the Horde side, I don't care what anyone says. Horde does attract more of certain types of people.   
---
You may find that you like the culture more on horde side. For me, I ended up coming back to the Alliance.
---
Yeah, the fact that you can literally choose a server to opt out of pvp should tell you its not a PvP focused game. It can be if you want, but it's not pvp focused at its core.
---
Have you ever played a mage? Let me tell you gear doesn't do shit besides just mana pool and most of the time we already get enough mana for 4 blizzards at least which is all we need lol. You can get enough gear literally just doing 5 quests in between areas.
---
I leveled a paladin to 60 and my friends kinda bailed, so i went on Faerlina and ended up joining Crusade. I noticed a dude talking in guild chat that was a priest and had the same name as a guy from my guild in vanilla. I messaged him and it turns out it was the same guy! Now that im 60, looking forward to playing with him.
---
pissin'
---
BFD is cancer to tank. All the mobs stun or disarm and you're at a level where you don't have enough abilities to control them easily.
---
I do enjoy the PVP aspect at the entrance though, you're not making that part up!
---
Alliance player being owned by a shapiro rogue (2019 coloirzed)
---
Even worse, mageblade from the same boss is better right now
---
I'm doing really good dps with OEB, like 600+ dps on boss fights in MC. But at the same time we have another warrior with BB doing similar dps.
---
ive been paying for my greens to get DE this whole time. son of a.. lol . thank you so much!
---
Athene, is that you?
---
Lol, this is pointless. 
---
How does someone know what trinkets someone on the opposite faction has? You can’t inspect. 
---
If you’re good, you’ll activate reflector after a mage has already cast it. 
---
Anyway, I’m sorry I wasted your time. I was just trying to help you in case you decided to run a hunter in the future. AGM isn’t going to help. I think you’re just being stubborn and don’t want to admit you’re wrong.
---
Reminder that classic wow launched with only 2 pvp realms
---
I can’t seem to find where to turn on Pet Health in the Party window, or to have it in the AddOn Grid.  I’m a healer and wanted to track pet health.  Anyone have suggestions?
---
Mageblade is the most contested drop in the game alongside Pereditions. (Leaf and such are a rarer, but have less competition.)
---
yes
---
Oh, I was thinking Duels not PvP
---
Free ride? You act likes raids are hard to come by. This content is easy. Groups are plentiful.
---
The real commodity are decent people. I don't ban classes from my groups like a butthurt bitch...but you do.
---
Reflect on your stupidity.
---
Modern wow is a bit impersonal, with people from many servers sort of cooperating and doing raids and dungeons.
---
Vanilla wow had just 1 server, 1 population. The people on your side were what you had, you saw the same people in cities, while questing, doing raids and dungeons, the same guilds and players everywhere.
---
Which means that people form a community, there is much more interaction and you really get to know people, you are able to form very close friendships.
---
&gt;Anyone in range of you can dismount with you a discombobulator ray, having an epic mount doesn't add much extra security.
---
And yet, having an epic mount is your best chance to get out of range. It's literally your only lifeline in that situation. For every time you get dismounted there's probably 3 or 4 times it'll save your life.
---
Mount &gt; everything else, no exceptions.
---
A guy I've known IRL for 20 years donated $900 to one of the Method people in their stream in the last few weeks, because he's a fanboy with no life and violently defends these streamers like they were his god damned parents.. 
---
And for reference he makes probably in the 50-60,000 a year, so it's not like he's just flush with cash. He just wanted to purchase a moments notice from what he considers to be a celebrity and give some meaning to his life.
---
Don't pug with a masterlooter with a known toxic personality?
---
I mean, he can only ninja as masterlooter so...
---
This is a WAR game...
---
As much as I'd like BG's out, I'm fine with waiting -- since when AV or WSG comes out that's pretty much all I'd be doing from that point on.
---
That's just not true. Stop posting shit.
---
He slept more than several of the people on the method 24-7 stream, are they cheaters too?
---
I believe it's only around 14% of you SP goes to blizzard.  
---
You want more int so you can cast more blizzards and still be able to finish off with Nova, CoC, AE, etc.
---
Spirit also helps if you are using mage armor.
---
In full pre-raid BiS and some MC epics (including azuresong), my blizzard damage only jumps by about 8 damage per tick.  
---
If I instead put on high int gear, I can get a whole extra blizzard and have some room for a shatter to finish.
---
Interesting. I tested hunters sting a similar way and it didn't drain any mana... maybe because it is tic based like a dot?
---
The PVE is so much easier, the PVP is much more rock, paper, scissors, but.... something about the community and just the general attitude within the game makes it much more enjoyable to me. I also hate the removal of tier gear, the addition of titan forging, the removal of PVP vendors, and the lack of people in the open world of retail. Also in terms of character immersion, I feel much more like a mage when I'm able to cast all three spells of schools rather than just the school I'm specced into.
---
Hey thanks bud, tip for you as repayment: you cannot reflect in-flight projectiles in classic, that was private servers.
---
Maybe rest of your group didn't cancel failed attempt?  
---
Sometime you need to cancel failed quest and pickup it again. It won't reset from failed state.
---
&gt; Most enchanters will have a stockpile of mats for different enchants
---
This is untrue.
---
Probably the hardest pack in the instance, add the patrol hat increase chance of wiping. So yeah it's clearly not my favourite boss to do even if he is just at the beginning
---
That dude deserves a hero. A hunter or a shaman. That can put a totem/pet back @ corridor or ladders. Insta-breaks raid ID=No arena event &amp; people leaving the raid.
---
i havent picked yet
---
Yeah but I believe their policy actively enables botting, especially in Classic. (I used to do it a lot)
---
The thing is, these bots are able to grind 60 and farm/sell enough gold to compensate for the cost of being banned due to so much time between waves.  Then they just roll a new account and start over.  Gold sellers are selling gold for like $10-20 per 100g.  It's really easy to bot 400+ gold in a few months
---
You got horrible advice and it has cost you dozens of hours
---
It's just good business... for honor
---
waiting to find someone i can play with then pick
---
I'm a rogue, so it's all good.
---
How so? It's a definite measure of how popular he is. He used it as a reason why he can do whatever he wants, completely ignoring his present average count.
---
Not to mention, it feels like they also don't enforce rules in classic like they would in retail. 
---
On a role-play server, a guy named Iluvtospewg has been running around since the start. But naming rules aren't being enforced. Report them... hell, mass report them... and it'll never get changed.
---
Bugs go on forever. Players can be shouting things that go against to ToS... reporting does nothing.
---
https://youtu.be/6jM7IyV6Rn8
---
This is the only one I know.
---
I believe the "average" thorium required to go from 275-300 blacksmithing is 750 bars, and right now they're just over 50s each, so we'll round, which leaves you at roughly 325g. Since I bought mine before the removal of layering, I was paying closer to 40s per, which puts the cost right at 300g. Prior to 275 I was able to get the mats myself, since I was leveling, but I hit 60 without 300 mining and I wasn't about to spend days of /played trying to farm thorium ore before the release of DM E, so I just bought it.
---
He averages 1k now, that massive.
---
I don’t want to be rude, this works with one off pugs. But if you are a guild that continues to do raiding and your loot system is a simple roll off... lol. That is so many issues waiting to happen. Can’t wait for people to have bad roll dice and get no items in months, while others get epic after epic. It’s a good concept if you pug, outside of that it’s just issues asking to happen.
---
You could drop 2 librams for +40 FR, Incendius wrist of frozen wrath with FR. And if you want to go all in - elemental mage staff for +20 more. And in the end if you aren't under FR totem or alike - prepot magic resistance pot.
---
people so underestimate the OEB.. especially for non human warriors. It has + 8 weapon skill and with the strength is the equivalent to around 70 dps.
---
Last raid I was #1 dps with it and I beat out a death bringer warrior. With world buffs I will have 48% crit this upcoming week (I have 30% crit unbuffed in zerk stance)
---
The crit cap for 2h with max hit (6% with +5 weapon skill) is 53.5%. For dw the crit cap is 34 + your hit chance from gear. This is for white hits btw
---
Holy ego dude.
---
Think he's mad because now he's just 1 of 1,000,000,000 mages now that play WOW.
---
Literally wasn't the case for all the other people screeching about streamers before the game out. It was ALL streamers that they were hating on not just Asmongold. Asmongold just got more shit than the others.
---
You could also try selling tanking services for the fee of taking unneeded drops. People seem more agreeable to that since they’re not directly out of pocket, and from my friend who does this all the time, it’s often more gold than the going rates for straight money payments for taking
---
I miss my uncle Charles ya'll!
---
You don't even need that much int lol, The only limiting factors of AOE farming is levels for high water levels, spawn rates, mob competition. 
---
That's literally it. You almost always have enough mana with the int gear you get from quests in between locations and AOE farming lol. Int does literally nothing for caster besides just mana pool and it's by no means hard to get. Literally higher level water is a more valuable resource. 
---
Also what? Because he has more int you think he can suddenly despawn other mages already farming or the horde? Stam give health, we shouldn't get hit at all. Int give mana, that's it. Not more damage just mana, which we're good on passively. 
---
Spell power? Does literally nothing, even at the highest spell power you can get at like level 40s being like 100+ for frost damage it's only a small amount added to the **total** damage on blizzard, not each of its ticks so it's almost useless.
---
Oh yeah, good call
---
Meanwhile there are dickhead using "tough it up" to roll over other people.
---
You could always be mana burned in cheetah.  Bear and Cat dont have mana bars and shouldn't be able to be burned but currently are.
---
I was in after the patch but now I DC'ed and stuck trying to log in.  What did they break?
---
I'm an undergeared fresh 60. I like that this will be an actual warmode (unlike BFA). I'm gonna work with my guild and try to gear up so i can be useful. Then maybe patrol lowbie zones and fuck over baddies that wanna gank lower levels on my faction.
---
Sure you can, MC isn’t that hard. What’s hard is balancing a WoW schedule between 30 people and their work schedules. At least, that *can* be hard, but isn’t always.
---
I love WC, completed the whole fang set on my shaman for fun.
---
Sunken temple, gives me PTSD.
---
that moment when you think you'll be safe as a fresh 60
---
He's started CodeAcademy at least 3 times man, show some respect.
---
Back in a day, I got in an another guild run that with stones / everything reserved. But they let me play with them, cleaning scholo more than 2 times when I was level 57. Nice XP boost tho.
---
How many under lvl 60 did you see?
---
Also I only have def gear, its more of a reckoning compilation really :P
---
Not sure of your situation but went from meh to loving it and playing more when we moved into contested zones and started pvping. We've had a few fairly started 2v2 fights, ganking attempts that have 180d on the gankers, and killing some skulls that she still randomly brings up weeks later.
---
Why would a priest who’s healing bring sp gear to his dungeon run? 
---
Same goes for druids and (god forbid) tanking paladins, why would they bring dps gear if they are tanking?
---
The problem is if a tank dies, a warrior can offtank by putting on a shield, or if the fight for some reason is easier with dual tanks, warriors often carry a plate set with them for survivability
---
Otherwise it is just a problem due to poor inventory management...
---
Keychains are cool and all but not really worth all the crying. It is a qol improvement, but not necessary by any means
---
A cool thing to do  is CC the hunter and kill the pet.  The bot usually just stands there melee'ing the mob.  
---
I usually get them a bunch of mob deaths so they have to go repair
---
He did tho? It was an upgrade for like 20 people. He didn’t give anyone a chance to roll, took the staff and dipped. That is the definition of ninja looting lol
---
Or don’t be a Karen. Blizzard shouldn’t reverse these. How do they know that other loot rules weren’t made in discord. If someone ninjas just blacklist them.
---
I may be mistaken, but if you ask me it looks and sounds like has been on one helluva cocaine binge... His demeanor screams it.
---
Not having many abilities is one of the reasons  the pvp is awesome I reckon.  I do feel the pain for warriors though, but it does give bear tanks  a chance to  shine.
---
I played Vanilla and tbc/wotlk on a pvp server and I completely agree with the sentiment that WoW is not a pvp game.
---
The pvp part is a minor part of the game and the entire focus of the game is on PvE.
---
Just look at the survey we had on this sub. The overwhelming amount of players play on pvp servers, but very few have pvp as their goal.
---
I’d like that but on my survey LFG always shames people trying to sell tanking services. I usually avoid asking for anything unless people reach out to me to tank
---
ooph, cringe
---
You know what I meant... on the last tick. Where the spell is no longer cancelable, but the projectile has not come out yet. Why do you have to be a smart ass?
---
I haven't updated it in ages, will do thanks.
---
quit dude. 
---
that's not healthy.
---
There's going to be a lot of dungeon grinding going on because of the open world chaos. You're a warlock so I highly recommend doing torch runs. Its mind numbingly boring and makes you no money but its amazing XP. Basically you get a priest and 3 mages and pull as much of the torch room non elites as possible with your eye of kilrogg. The mages AOE the doorway and everything dies. You can do this with no pauses if the mages drink every chance they get.
---
Like literally every pro athlete? Oh better not watch any movies or tv because there WILL be product placement.
---
Sounds like Athene
---
How do you make that kine of money with such a small stream?  500-1000 people does not seem like much.
---
Look at his ears. Not human
---
Defending shitty streamers that don't know or care you exist is S-tier cringe.
---
God those names are cancer. I'm glad RP realms exist, and I don't even RP.

&gt;  let the baddies be called out and BANISHED from the community. 
---
almost no one cares. most of the players right now do not care for raid drama because they are not 60, play for raid night then go do destiny or work on thanksgiving plans for the rest of the week.  The handful that stay logged into the wow chat service even a portion of those actually go to forums or would venture into reddit to see a name and shame thread.
---
Shadow weaving
---
What the point? People usually measure exp/hour.  
---
Normal should be around 20-25k and max is 40-45k
---
You seem like a triggered fan. Not one thing from my post says " salty or jealous" if anything it questions the "skill" you seem to be infatuated with.
---
Just wait till they're done. 30 mins left.
---
For the love of god yes, leveling a warrior was one of the most challenging things I have done in wow.
---
Nobody said wow was a pvp focused game. That being said wow had very natural world pvp and awesome bgs, honor system was also natural.
---
Wow was a pvp game because you could literally just pvp one you lvled up and have huge amounts of fun, PvP and raids were true endgame of vanilla wow.
---
Wow was a pve game because you could never touch PvP if you didn't want to.
---
That's what is great about vanilla/classic: in can be a game you want it to be.
---
That's not what he means :P In retail, when you swap targets, your combo points come with you. It's very very useful for things like target swaps due to fight tactics, or for interrupts, PvP fights etc. It doesn't mean that you have combo points on two targets, just that you don't lose them when you swap targets.
---
use this time to learn wood working or play an instrument or something. If you are actually addicted to wow, it's only going to interfere with your job search and home life once you do become eligible for work.
---
Reddit being reddit by thinking they accomplished something when they didnt.
---
lmao that's not how it works
---
How do I downvote twice?
---
Tell me how I defended his actions, I’m really curious.
---
The ternary operator is escaped so instead of printing the result of evaluation, it's printing the text.
---
why not just cast Cone of Cold and Arcane Explosion if you're using this rational
---
Yeah but that's fine, it's understood if ya have 4 or 5 melee you probably want buff and loot diversity anyways.  Now if there is only one melee then it's an issue lol.
---
If I pull up my /4 on Heartseeker,  you almost cannot scroll the chat frame during hours and not see at some point the word reserved or RES.   It's gotten so bad it's every few lines.  
---
The one that I absolutely love though...  Groups looking for a tank, reserving tank items.  Those are the best, reserve the one item that might draw the rarest role you need the most and will have to wait on.  The stupidity is exceptionally string in those people.
---
You seem very angry friend.
---
So I guess I've learned that A) my understanding is correct and B) you all are blowing it way out of proportion.  Get some fresh air my dude, no need to be upset over something so small
---
What have they hotfixed exactly?
---
If he says that, you know he's not open to learning and you know he's one to avoid.
---
There was one outside alterac ruins killing yetis and skinning them last night on thunderfury. Behavior is so odd it's pretty easy to spot.
---
They've actually fixed a ton of bugs since release.
---
Not worse than a lvl 31 holy paladin in cloth, leather with int and a few str mail pieces with no mount.
---
It's a common library of fonts/media/sounds that any addon can share with other addons. LibSharedMedia comes with WeakAuras and lots of other addons.
---
Shadowpanther.net will tell you.
---
Dang I have to say the item name? There’s no just #showtooltip Ranged Weapon or whatever the slot would be called?
---
Thanks for saying it. I'm also of the opinion that Classic WoW has possibly the worst pvp system of all video games. The whole honor grind based upon how much you grind relative to how much other people grind is completely stupid. It awards no-lifers and account-sharing NEETs who are able to PvP for 18 hours a day for 3 months straight.
---
Yeah, no joke. Vanilla wow forums on patch day were a great source of drama
---
**ability slightly nerfed**
---
"The priest community has been kicked around long enough! We are tired of being second class citizens" followed by a 20 paragraph dissertation
---
I know it said an hour but the servers are up
---
yeah they have certainly changed something about them and put noting in the notes about it, they did put a note in about onyxia threat so i assume they nerfed the guid tank threat clever use of mechanics
---
You could play up to level 20-30 without Questie for "full vanilla experience".  
---
But after this I would strongly recommend to start using it.  
---
It's not about skipping quest text (and by default Questie doesn't change this). It's about missing ton's of quests that literally in the next room.
---
Lol what does the American server have to do with it?  He was streaming TO THE WORLD.
---
She rolled a healer in classic. Though she hardly has time to play anymore, so we run a tank / healer combo slowly through content. Only up to SFK now.
---
Of course I'm speaking of faction imbalance... Cross server BGs are aimed to be a solution to faction imbalance
---
Side note, boondocks saints is one of my favorite movies of all time.
---
We're looking into that.
---
I am absolutely not a fan, the only time I ever even watch Twitch is for CS:GO tournaments, I've never even redeemed a twitch prime sub outside of subbing for tournament emotes
---
Not the same person you were talking to, but I'll say I noticed it. I can't recall them ever charging outside of melee before, but they definitely did this last time. I had not heard of the change before, but I noticed it so that makes sense.
---
He didn't roll need, he master looted the staff to himself. Watch the video.
---
this is that slippery slope the #nochanges people were all about preventing because this is exactly what happened "to ruin retail". This is my surprised face.
---
https://i.imgur.com/7yygVJx.jpg
---
Well the only Method faster than that kicked him.
---
Well with world PvP now it will be much more difficult
---
Used to 2 man full strath living as holy priest + frost mage in vanilla. Was very fun and really good gold (I didn't know about jump runs then)
---
From PVE enemies. Priest one is interesting and if the start the cast while you are out of form it does appear to Drain when resolved. Hunter sting does not...
---
Feral in classic would be viable without power shifting if they removed debuff limit on bosses. But this would introduce a whole slew of other issues
---
The only reason powershifting is the go to pve method is because the inability to use bleeds. But I mean if you didn't want to powershift we all kinda knew at the start and you should have rolled a pure dps class like rogue or warrior.
---
I know people are grateful in these sort of situations, but youll run scholo plenty at 60 trying to get specific pieces of BiS gear. They arent doing you a favor, they're exploiting you.
---
Its a game, not an unpaid internship. I hope others don't fall for this.
---
I've done the Vast Sea Deep Ocean quest several times and it's pretty easy. My suggestion is to get a mob, drag it to the surface, fight it, then dive down and get another. Do this until you've cleared the path, and then swim in, loot box, swim back up immediately. If you're a warrior or rogue, you can pull with a bow/thrown weapon. Paladins have it a bit rougher in that regard, but I just judgment -&gt; swim close enough to the surface to be able to breathe right after combat.
---
We are going to start doing dungeons raids with some PUG characters to get our name out there and show what our guild is like.
---
So because your trashcan guild can’t complete it in under an hour, it must be impossible? Big lols
---
Yeah, I just thinking that. Judgment of course is amazing, but the old one looks pretty cool also.
---
How many viewers does he even have though? I heard his stream was dying out naturally.
---
54 priest who just swapped to healing spec to start hunting pre raid bis gear.  Last week I could at least put up a fight if questing solo, I have a feeling he will be a dungeon only character for a few weeks.
---
Finally started a warrior alt for later though.
---
"Sorry for the confusion" they say months later when this could/should have already been nipped in the bud. Blizzard tries to be way too cryptic about shit and it just causes more delays and confusion.
---
Yea we are going to do the same thing.
---
How are you sapping when permanently dotted?
---
the problem with the claim is that there are nearly 8 billion people on earth. around 7 billion at the time of vanilla, and only a few million played wow at all, and a much smaller number of those that played to the detriment of their life.  it had nearly zero impact on 'technological development". the type of people contributing to the advancement of human technology are not just 'nerds'. they are extremely driven people.
---
Same here on Sulfuras
---
I played on the server haha
---
You don't. either your mana and survivability allows you to slowly whittle them down after a long time, or you lose. Vanilla paladin was pretty bad and i say that as someone who played one exclusively during vanilla. But your heals are endless and they can't do much about it, in some cases trying to bait the interrupt will give you a edge since getting spell locked out of holy is almost your entire spell roster.
---
but try to shock them down for bust with your judgements then flash back to full hp. Make friends with a good warrior since you enable them to walk all over enemies. And when BC comes out you will actually have a new melee ability to spec into to attack things.
---
Me.
---
Ok boomer
---
yep. down for me
---
What are those people doing all day ? Still farming prebis? If you have a prebis char there's really no reason to log on besides raiding. ( if your focus is pve)
---
Best staff until... next phase. And it's not even the best *weapon* right now.
---
You're welcome to check us out. PM me if interested.
---
why would even raid with guy? you sound like a cry baby tbh. 
---
doesn’t esfand ninja loot for himself too? and asmongold?
---
I get that. I normally have terrible rolls  so I never expect to win anything but every so often I do. I am ok with it.
---
The people who actually join these groups and give in to this kinda shit is a problem.  
---
If everyone just doesn't party with those kind of ass-hats, it will stop when they are looking for hours without action.
---
But too many people keep joining these reserve runs and so it's only getting worse and worse.  
---
I did a Strat UD run the other day, tank getting all the "unneeded" items, which in the end means he just looted **the whole freaking dungeon** since none of the items the rest of the group needed dropped.
---
I've never felt more disgusted during and after a run ...
---
He even was bitching because people where greeding on stuff instead of passing (auto-response you know?)
---
4 persons spending an hour of their life to feed some random asshat tank, wtf is wrong with people ?!  
---
But I guess most people don't care about loot / time investment and will gladly spend their free time to gear up some random self-entitled ass-face.
---
Unbelievable.
---
My realm was up for a few minutes after restart, but I logged out and can't get back in. "World down"
---
Before I logged out I tried to look at the PvP/Honor panels and nothing was working.
---
Less than 1% are going to be going for rank 14 dude.  They aren’t the only people playing the game lol.  My guild is invading Orgrimmar again this week *for fun*.  Even if the most serious pvper got 10,000 dhk’s today it would only set them back a week.  There is no permanent penalty and no negative values. Yes, if you’re going for rank 14 there is no time for city raids, pve raids, bathroom breaks, work, and sleep.  That doesn’t mean people who just want to slowly work their way up to Knight can’t do other activities however.
---
Then care to explain where that unfounded argument came from? Sure sounds like it came from A deffensive point of view.

There's heavy sedation so you don't feel shit going home. The ice packs are for later.
---
I was an officer and a guild master for some years, so I understand why it can be interesting to spectate. :-)
---
I don't think anyone would care if he just ninja looted &amp; would not have been a dick about it. Toxicity is what's shitty about all this.
---
Imagine hating Princess Bride
---
I was just running in autoattack btw. Also attacking because I was bored. 0 efforts. I know unpaid internship can be exploitable but they are already farming it, getting in someone that needs xp is a good thing.
---
I'm not sure exactly what you took issue with in my original statement. I'm simply stating that the demographics of today is vastly different from 2004, and in my experience and observation, the clear line was crossed somewhere around 2013 when smartphones reached a critical threshold.
---
The transition in internet userbase was not so much a slow linear change but an exponential explosion after the turn of the decade. Something seriously changed about internet culture and my anecdotal experience place the year of the transition at around 2013.
---
That's it!!
---
... this is a pretty darn good healer weapon.
---
Did you even watch the video? He masterlooted it to himself.
---
It does not matter if it was an upgrade or not. He did not allow anyone else to roll on it and just gave it to himself. That is a ninja.
---
Is he really being serious? If so, he has some delusions of grandeur.
---

If you dont want to make one yourself, there are many people who make class kits. Take a look.
---
All I have done is leave my opinion on an Internet forum. Only one of us is blowing it out of proportion, lol
---
That's because we were nerds before nerds were cool.
---
You must be trolling.
---
I think it’s pretty similar in length to sunken temple.  Doing everything in sunken temple has taken me roughly 2-3 hrs every run (including all bosses).  Gnomergan for a full clear (which almost no one does honestly, most people skip crowd pummeller area except for the punch card, and sometimes skip trogg boss), and skip  a lot of content through jumps, it’s taken me 2-2.5 hours.  Maybe I was just going through temple slowly though.
---
He doesn't. You will never get a reply.
---
Spend it all. Got 2 epic mounts main + alt. Crafted bis boe's, lhh, strong gaunt, hide of the wild &amp; shifting sand, dark iron set, bought quell and warden staff. Just picked up a signet for pvp. Money has to flow, but i've also got 18 titans ready more black lotus sitting in bank and working on distilled. Plenty of pots and elixers even for future raids. And silently working on gathering arcanite bars currently at 15 for titanic and 23 for maybe a TF a man can dream.
---
I am a fury war that ot every now and than but you never know who drops out of the guild next so i am ready to become mt in a moments notice, and my resto druid is an officer in a pleb guild but I have a lot of fun "carrying" noobs. And being anonymous towards my guildies is also very fun.
---
I've made most my money with farming recipes and selling them. Now its mostly jump + alchemy.
---
My guild in vanilla at the time was a multi game guild and the sole reason we picked up wow was for pvp.
---
Standing right next to you Pal!
---
No, he’s a moron.
---
I’m the one who put rune thread of AH for month after release. I can kindly say people’s idiocy paid for 150 out of the 900 gold needed for my epic mount.
---
What?
---
Definitely feels wrong. But so does saying Berenstain Bears sometimes.
---
They’ve already stopped playing. If your advice is get epic mount asap then it’s something I can follow going forward. If it’s just you coming here to tell me how foolish I am for choosing to play a tank as my first char ever it’s not exactly going to help me going forward.
---
&gt; on the subreddjt has no life
---
Njo.
---
&gt; playing classic has no life
---
Yes.
---
What, the construction thing? No, he bans anyone that mentions it, and refuses to say anything about it, for good reason.
---
I'm talking about his horrible job in the dungeon. To say it was comical would be underselling it. Sodapoppin puts it best: https://clips.twitch.tv/CourteousCulturedWaffleYouWHY
---
So my classic journey began with a warrior, since that's what I played during the original run. I got it to 60, but between rarely being able to find groups and my guild ignoring me I really lost interest in playing it. 
---
I had started leveling a rogue on a new server, which is now level 29. Right now though I decided to start a paladin, as I remember them being kind of fun back in the day. I'm kind of torn between trying to lolret and trying to heal at endgame. Obviously a paladin is going to be more likely to get into groups.. but how is it for rogues these days?
---
You might find some friendly people on that server here but I'd guess everyone is really spread out.
---
A good place to look would be the official wow forums for that realm. Which looks to be here:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/bloodsail-buccaneers
---
He is NOT the world first 60. The world first was in 2004. In a year nobody will know him
---
yea im night elf, if i joined up with you i could make a new guy
---
No this happens when you are too far away from the priest in question so your client doesn't know the gender selection so it can not parse the markup.
---
who was this again and why should we care lol
---
But who was birb?
---
I just assume this is a persona but regardless, mad corny.
---
Look at the other posts about this subject. Look at how insanely seriously people are treating this. Yes, it needs an /s.
---
I'm so sorry
---
Ok white knight
---
GG!
---
55-60/45-40 split in horde favor I’d say.
---
Yeah as 11 year old I had to play on PS since I had no cash and my parents "wouldn't give me money for that game nonsense"
---
Yeah they definitely changed the GUID mechanic. It seems like Fireball now drops threat on the primary target, can't speak for secondary targets in range (we didn't play with any strategies this week aside from "try to stay away from other people")
---
The "surge" has two components: charge a random player, and AoE knock back. Since the game was released, they have been doing the knock back. But before Tuesday, either they weren't doing the charge, or they would only charge a target in melee range (which made it seem like they're not charging at all). If your raid was stacking since week 1 then it's because that's how they worked in vanilla and private servers so that was the right strategy although unnecessary because Surgers were incorrectly scripted, and now I believe they're finally fixed
---
I rest my case. Your downvotes don't frighten me mortals. Aha
---
Can someone ELI5 Method? I am vaguely aware of esports and I thought it was mostly about winning money in tournaments. How does being a pro WoW player work? Just money from twitch subscriptions?
---
Wasn't dire maul a patch?  
---
  And that was part of phase 2 originally.
---
if you give a shit about honour you dont go near the other factions city or you roll a rogue to do it
---
questioning a skill equals being salty? 
---
Sure thing buddy. You missed the part where he went into what it took to be a streamer? 
---
And I am the salty one, sure.
---
That was the worst attempt at an insult, i only realized that's what it was when you wrote it.
---
Hf spending 3 hours in MC for no loot, i will be out playing a highly competitive intense organic game where i run around the whole world and murder *real* people.
---
Enjoy.
---
“His manager” is code for mom, right?
---
Jealous! I tried to get my fiancé into the game but he just doesn’t get the appeal :(  have you both been long time gamers or was this a first?
---
The shorter way of saying it, is that Blizzard created a good game and the mechanics were able to support PvP easily.
---
5/7 should have made it rubberband
---
Or more likely sold it on another character and now plays on that.
---
Genuinely believing the server bullied him into not playing is hilarious.
---
Your missing the point, in the time it takes them to form the group (because most people won't join now) they could have easily ran the dungeon once, possibly twice if looking for tanks, thus multiplying the chances to get the items to drop in the first place.  The people gearing up with the items they want, they weren't reserving them, they were spam clearing the dungeons.   Reserving is basically a guaranteed way to slow down your progression, the more you reserve, the slower the group forms.
---
Told mine I got HOJ and she said "oh" and turned around :(
---
I don't know what happened. Who is this and can I read this story somewhere?
---
If only people figured out a way to form communities built on mutual trust and friendship in retail. They could call it a guild.
---
Im from LA, al that time I was 17 and yeah, never even ocurred to me playing on retail. Also the PS that I played had 2k players all from my country, was a neat community. Probably existed some minor on retail but nothing like a whole server from my country. Also I played with like 6 classmates at that time
---
They were the "I hate pve" types too. We got owned when bgs came out and we were all under geared.
---
Huh? Yeah, I did and I don't even play on his server.  Hence me making fun of his argument that it didn't matter -- of course it did.  He made a fool of himself on an international stage.
---
I just looked up what /s means.  Did not know, thanks Urban dictionary.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted for having an opinion
---
Ngl if the dude/lady was reasonable looking and clean, I might be tempted to trade a quickie for an epic mount.
---
~~you~~ your friend will definitely want to put this new channel in a separate chat frame/tab, or it will quickly account for 90% of the text ~~you~~ they see.
---
Oh shit I meant Humar
---
bloodfang got worse, damn.
---
You are correct.  I have a screenshot of a priest with the T2 chest shortly after his guild got server first Nefarian, and it is definitely the old chest.
---
**NOCHANGES**
---
Don't tell people to stop reporting.
---
Keep fucking reporting this toxic behaviour. It should not be allowed.
---
They’ve already stopped playing. If your advice going forward is to save for mount ASAP it’s something I can follow. It you’re just here to tell me how foolish I am to roll a tank as my first wow character it’s not exactly providing a path forward that will help others in a similar predicament.
---
Oh yeah, again especially at hot spots like the pirates. On a balanced server that area is a warzone
---
So I finally hit level 30 as a ret pally, and I'm wondering, how much effort should I be putting into obtaining weapon upgrades? 
---
Or does it really just depend on how much effort I care to put into it? lol 
---
I'm level 30 and am currently using strike of the hydra and am thinking of trying to get the corpse maker axe from RFK - would it be worth the time, or should I just wait now until I can *try* and run armory for ravager?
---
You will make more than 100g in the time it takes you to grind to rank 3.
---
Yep. They aren't even fixing bugs now, just needing strats people find put that weren't prevelant in retail.
---
As long as blizzard is the police I'm fine with it. Unfortunately for the ninjas they life in a surveillance state.
---
Thanks for the first silver stranger!
---
Happy someone else agrees lol
---
There's also Xaryu. He's pretty cool.
---
I wasnt asking about your pve efforts, im asking is this not a better build for pvp? 10% groupwide silence/interrupt resist has to be more valuable than what, \~150 armor? I have 7000 armor right now and taking away 150 of that is about 0.4% physical damage resistance lost. 
---
I'm certain a 10% groupwide silence/interrupt resist is better than 0.4% physical damage reduction for you only.
---
leave that server so Horde have no alliance to kill.
---
I was never on the cutting-edge of raiding in Vanilla, so worrying about taking up debuff slots was never a consideration in my experience. 
---
The extra multishot damage is really situational, it's not a spell that can be used all the time without causing problems. I don't really remember ever having problems getting hit capped as a hunter, so I don't know for sure if it's really any better than all of the extra damage that comes from the agi, AP, and crit. Someone smarter than me would have to do the math there. 
---
And honestly, I think the INT plays a factor as well. It's never a primary stat, or anything to look for in gear, but getting nearly double from DS over GS is going to make a noticeable difference in the mana pool, and going OOM wasn't terribly uncommon back then.
---
Tons of players are in the same boat? Really? I played since vanilla beta, do you think I remember every item  that exists and where it drops? Because he basically does. We're not talking about those special items from each expansion everyone remembers, but something like a random belt that drops in slave pens nonheroic.
---
I'm not even saying that it's something to be proud of, but to say that tons of players who play since classic can do the same is just false.
---
I have all 96-99 parses in MC on my mage, as do several of our main mages.   None of us specifically wait for winters chill.  Its not really something you can say against him.  Hardly a thing.

---
Do you guys have any suggestions?

Preferably BoE, or a quest reward

it's a multi milion $ company and some russian cellar dwelling community funded neets had more communication with their community about problems/bugs/fixes and they were faster in fixing exploits

I tried it a few weeks back just for fun and got a couple sold for around 1.5g lol. Quite hilarious. It's not very reliable though.
---
Cool pic, factually incorrect though.
---
&gt; we shine in party based combat
---
Do you really though
---
Regarding the PvP ranks.  Can you only rank up a level per week?  Or if you farm enough HKs you can skip ranks?
---
Rogues are worse. Warriors at least have the option to tank. Pallies am not familiar with but lower level dungeons should be easy as you are able to both tank and heal. End game I usually see Pallies healing dungeons. Never partied with Ret. Only 1 or 2 Prot tanks.
---
I see
---
Method pay him. 
---
He slaps Method banners and links all over his shit. People click it, buy merch, etc.
---
Easy advertisement and money for Method.
---
Pretty sure they offered him the spot simply for getting world first 60 because it shows competence and dedication or something
---
Doesn't last long
---
Been reading a series of books involving naval combat like this (Safehold, can recommend), and the writer keeps hammering on the fact that the cannonballs didn't really do much damage because they were relatively small, it was the splinters rocketing around the decks that would kill people.
---
So this scene was just another level of nonsense, he would have been shredded to bits in seconds.
---
OHHHH WELLLLL
---
55 shadow priest here! part of me really wants to continue questing til i ding 60 because i love it, but the other part of me thinks i should just respec holy/disc and start grinding dungeons for gear.

i need some advice!

Did you include screenshots of loot rules and the rolls?
---
I just want to say that comparing "PR'ing their way out" of things to doing due diligence and fact checking seems awful OP.
---
The world bos has almost no chance of being taken down by Alliance on my server
---
Blizz does not do shit
---
Greatings loyal honorbuddy customer until the end of wod
---
C’mon dude, they had at least one year to think about this fucking key ring and now they tell us they can’t do it because phase =|= patch? downtime every fucking week for realm restarts? Fuck blizz and their marketing team and of course their dev leads.
---
Highmountain tauren druid travel form i guess.
---
Whats the point of raiding and getting nightslayer gear if I’m just going to use devilsaur the whole time
---
How did he do it without it going to roll? I thought he’d at least need roll need despite not needing it
---
Not even that good compared to other loot in the same instance
---
Mages are soo OP vs melee that this videos aren't that impressive . Infinite kite ,this is why they can duel warriors and Rogues naked
---
If loot rules are set in-game, then anything set outside of the game in discord or otherwise is irrelevant
---
Maintenance =/= patch
---
come on man, dont be that guy
---
Might work, but once inside you have to run all the way up to make the lava jump, risking multiple attacks. But granted, might be superior due to p2

But hey man I was fraaaaaaamed
---
i bet he tells women this in the club to impress them
---
o wait he was the first level 60 i doubt hes spoken to a chick in years
---
what a cockbag id never even heard of this guy
---
Deathcharger reserved is equivalent to nothing being reserved. You could do a thousand runs with this guy and more than likely his reservation will still have yielded him nothing. So really, let the guy reserve that all he wants.
---
Okay. I disagree completely but to each their own.
---
I played WoW as a Holy Priest alone 15 years ago. This time my girlfriend joined me (first time WoW) as a Hunter (omg pet!). We only lvl together and shes doing amazing.
---
Were on Zandalar Tribe RP-PVP so theres a great mixture of social interaction and PVP.
---
Were nearing lvl 52 now and enjoy clearing areas of quests, running dungeons and corpse camping Horde that tries to gank us ;-)
---
Someone grab him!!!! He’s floating away to the moon!!
---
In terms of streamers it’s really good.
---
In terms of advertisements it’s low tier. Plus who here knows how much twitch viewers purpose through the ads? I’m sure the click through rate isn’t that great.
---
Think he meant sodium
---
LOL of fucking course it was Jokerd
---
i've always used ress for ressurection lol
---
What a cunt lol.
---
This is the right move by Method.  Well done.  I'm so glad there is still justice in the world.
---
Yep. For the average guild nobody will care about bringing an enhance but any guild that's into optimization and whatnot would rather take a real dps or a resto shaman that totem twists. Improved totems is so miniscule it's really not even worth mentioning tbh.
---
That said op should play what he wants but he should know an enhance shaman is bad in Pvp, meme tier in pve, fine in dungeons. He should also Expect to be last priority for loot as well. 
---
As another note expect to get world buff/consumes if you want to up your value.
---
It's a tip on the loading screen *because* people don't know it
---
In my experience things die too soon for CoA to do more damage than a Shadowbolt, that’s why I wouldn’t recommend anyone using it unless you’re fighting a boss.
---
Is Spy useful on a PvE server? For example, will it tell you who is flagged for PvP?
---
Ironic.
---
That’s such a good idea. Maybe I’ll wear my damage/tanking gear in the wild and put on my healing gear in dungeons!
---
Make sure you don't explain shit when entering the Guzzler :D
---
Yes, unless you have talent points to preserve rage in the arms tree. I think it’s a max 25 rage point, 5 per point invested.
---
Well the Mageblade+Drakestone is superior but the staff is still a good item for every mage or lock . 
---
He's just a kid who takes his confidence from his achievements in WoW and brags about it..  ignore him maybe he can turn his life around who knows.People like him are cancer.
---
Hunters are actually really good against both in this phase, as neither have enough burst yet to prevent a good hunter from kiting them.
---
who dis basement dweller lelz
---
Benediction priest on the right with t2 head piece, too.
---
That's item level. It basically sets a limit on that weapons stats.
---
They’re using a program to press hotkeys and buttons for them so their character can level, make gold, and/or other things (fishing, auction house sniping) while the player is not at their computer. It can be done while they’re at the computer but what’s the point
---
Because it comes out tomorrow
---
What does that have to do with anything? Obviously people will join but more will leave. Do you still have 5 layers and 40k queues on your realm like at launch? People were quitting back in vanilla too but more new people joined than quit as it was a growing game up to the end of Wotlk.
---
It was ridiculous drama. After 17 Raids or so people randomly didn't show up the raid after their most desireable item dropped. Our maintank left after he had both Bindings which made our Guildlead tilt insanely hard, people randomly didn't show up and stuff and he wasn't there in the night we probably needed him most and the Co-Leader left alongside his girlfriend who left because she didn't have enough DKP to get the Mageblade after she and 2 others agreed to roll for it and whoever wins the roll gets the Mageblade for their max dkp. She decided that she didn't want to roll that night and it dropped. It was sad but yeah. I don't really know how I will continue in classic now.
---
Ok cool
---
Does anyone know that quest name? I'm reading that I may need to do part one which is killing pyron outside of BRd which I'm dreading. Phase two ftw
---
I love the sneaky Skyrim reference lol. That game is still so much fun, just a shame it takes so long to properly mod.
---
Did you ever find a fix for this? I did the same as you and Dominos is no longer able to place the loot frame where I want it.
---
 This post explains it in detailed but short version is he ninja staff of dominance they bragged about it on his stream.
---
Lol at “loktar”, I bet your server is 90% horde
---
Why I keep seeing there isnt nothing useful for tanks in Strat Live but when I see the loots and guides there are like 3 Bis for tanks there?
---
I think you’re doing gods work
---
That’s actually really sad and bizarre.
---
Ofcourse it is, but it's better for Mages / Warlocks. They get priority, this wasn't in a pug raid.
---
That's because there aren't any bots anymore really. They only ban when they detect a cheat.
---
That’s what everyone seems to think lol, I’ll just keep enjoying my level 45 mage on a pve realm while the hardcore neck beards enjoy their several BiS 60s
---
I think the mistake you made was starting your alliance on mograine, not sure they're better for population
---
resserved
---
LoS pulls are your friend. So many people don't do that anymore and wipes are inevitable.
---
Oh absolutely, he gets hit by several small pieces that just bounce off, in reality the would have stabbed into him, or at the very least staggered him like a really hard punch.....
---
That being said it looks absolute amazing the way they did it
---
😩 horde or ally?
---
Well rp pvp but I've been having a great time overall on zandalari-tribe. People are nice, horde/alliance ratio is good.
---
Dude, heroin.
---
&gt;Int does literally nothing for caster besides just mana pool

He heals every time someone dies, not when he shadow bolts.

This version of healcomm has an option to disable the display of HoTs or limit the duration of HoTs to display. You can find it under the addon tab of the interface options.
---
It's not exactly a healthy habit.
---
He ninja'd a Staff of Dominance during a PuG MC run he was leading on his American WoW account on stream.
---
Why are you looking worldwide for a guild to level a new toon, instead of joining any raiding guild at the server u got the lvl 60 priest at?
---
I slap everyone with underwater breathing, even in major cities. I am just trying to do my part
---
If people want to compromise their account security by sharing it, more fool them.
---
Stay shadow, run instances a bunch. If it’s an issue respec. I think you’ll manage most instances.
---
The issues may arise when your tank isn’t protection and your dps sucks.
---
Not always. Welcome to reddit.
---
I wasn't referring to this as an exploit.  I was referring to the fact Esfand gets special treatment from GM's.  They accidentally reset MC that week.  I understand it wasn't intentional but the GM's allowed them to clear it a second time, bypassing the weekly reset timer.
---
Just kill boars in elwyn forest. 
---
PvP is disabled in that zone.
---
- Michael Scott
---
If you are the tank you will be fine at 57 (56 if you healer is good). The dps should be fine if they are all 55. The last boss is level 59, but most of the trash is 51-55. 
---
If you have a warlock in your group, banish a fire elemental in groups where there are 2. Trust me you’ll enjoy not taking aoe fire balls
---
You now get points for killing the other faction. You can rank up and use these points to buy PVP gear, etc.
---
But how?
---
Me and the boys would be a good guild for ya, sure you could find a life partner there.

Cold blood/prep

I mean, the person does seem to have a point though. the reply to people, to correct them on a class, seems valid enough.

Because most of the people who liked it grew up and realized it's fucking shite lol. It's literally like some Dave Portnoy analogue watched Reservoir Dogs after the Pats game and thought he should make a movie. Absolutely unwatchable when one is not a teenager.
---
An hour a day you're looking at 8 months to hit 60, on average.  10 days played is a typical number, which is 240 hours.
---
I don’t think he’s a particularly good guy but I think that might be a little presumptuous.
---
Yeah just to piss off my step bro, camp him while he’s running to BRD good idea!
---
Ask this question and future questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dw76vk/daily_questions_megathread_november_14_2019/)

You're more likely to get an answer.
---
I wonder if he regrets stealing that staff now? lol
---
I actually know someone who made a fishing bot using Auto Hotkey and OCR for the bobber, it’s interesting and I’m wondering how easily that could be remade for WoW other things
---
Shadow priest only depend on wanting to ensure they never go OOM when killing 1-2 mobs at a time.
---
Food for thought. Warlocks can only ever choose to be DPS, whether in PVP or PVE. Should you ever want to Heal, Priests give you that option. Similar idea with Warriors and Rogues for tanking.
---
Yes! That's why he messed up SW due to lowbies dying.
---
Bruh I’m in that guild 😂 not necessarily looking for a new one either cause I like this guild. Just need some friends on discord and shit. Admittedly I haven’t gotten on me and the boy’s discord yet.
---
running guns to mexico, spying on political opponents, and starting isis are more presidential
---
Idk. Seems a bit excessive to get that upset over whether intellect is useful to aoe grind as a mage...
---
it's not that special, UBRS speed depends mainly on pull knowledge, can go really fast even with pugs.
---
I did consider a PVP server.  But then I realized that I'd just get pissed off when I want to do something and someone else decided that them wanting PVP was more important.  Not worth it for me.  It's not like PVP doesn't happen on PVE servers either (on my server discord already talks of brawls in SS/TM) but we get the choice to do it when we want, not have it forced on us.
---
But yeah, to each their own.
---
To continue on the multi boxing isn’t the issue, it’s actual non-player bots here

i use whatever version addons like vuhdo use, im not sure if you are the creator of that too but is it possible in that?
---
Be a geared warrior and don't forget to bring your support team*
---
Gear means nothing when you can't get a hit off.
---
While this is very true, and especially the case in dungeons like strat. If you LoS everything in this place you’d be here for a full day... while some pulls los is good, most can’t just charge and smash
---
My understanding is that you can skip ranks, but I’ve never been pvping at a fresh launch of honor. 
---
I can’t imagine they’d limit all players to a max one level gain each week!
---
Hunters literally use multishot in their single target rotation. 15% damage on one of the 2 skills in your rotation is significant.
---
I like tanking simply because of supply and demand. I could probably join a group and convince them to kick out a dps warrior because I don't want the competition.
---
You did nothing wrong - at least you mentioned it before hand!
---
Who would want to join this guy in a PuG or guild in the future?  He's toast.
---
Got Methodically removed, what a Jokerd.
---
I was a warrior tank for all of TBC and wrath. Warriors were every fun class for me. I think personal taste matters.
---
exactly this, it's known that he abused the non-classic mechanics but somehow did not get banned for it
---
So if you click on summary it shows you all his gear and enchants in detail. I would say almost every top Druid healer on Warcraft logs in the regrowth build. I personally was down ranking a lot before reviewing all this and was placing last in healing in my guild. I then switched to these max levels and got 6th place beating all the priest but 1. I’m also specced pvp 30/0/21 moonglow and my healing skyrocketed with this style of raid healing
---
I got you, pal.
---
Yeah isn’t that the sky darkeners cape? Off the top of my head but if I got that I need to go outside more often
---
definitely
---
&gt; +healing gear
---
Not particularly easy to get if you haven't already been collecting it while leveling. I was looking in the AH last night on my server, and there was nothing listed over level 34
---
What a head case...
---
actualy a blue dagger and offhand give u similar stats. mc loost just  crap.
---
Want to point out that I appreciate the work you have done and decision you made to share it with the community.  I've ran similar models myself to determine the most effective use of stats, and it boiled down to a few things:
---
1) In general, the more +healing you have, the more valuable +int is and vice versa.  Certain situations can skew this statement, but this is the most important takeaway.
---
2) In raids, not all priests have the same role.  The stats you choose should be alignment with your role, such as shared main rank heals, raid heals, or dispell duty.
---
3) In 5-man dungeons with efficient, quick groups, it is important to conserve as much mana as possible (i.e. favor +healing) to avoid drinking/oom, thus slowing the party down; however, if you have a mage in your party who requires drinking after every pull, its a moot point as you may as well drink too.
---
4) In other dungeons where you are required to abolish disease, dispell, or pre-bubble a mage intending to AoE nuke a pack and send the party into a frenzy, +int is more effective.  (If you have a less experienced/geared group and your priest duties go beyond casually casting the most mana efficient spell on autopilot, I suggest +int.)
---
5) In PvP, you want INT and STAM, plain and simple.
---
Oh shit, did you know you could do whatever the fuck you want? Actually, since he can do whatever the fuck he wants and you beat him to level 60, you can do whatever the fuck he wants too. Or whatever the fuck anyone else wants. Damn, we don't even know who the fuck you or he is. Awe inspiring
---
Obviously nobody realizes hes just trolling. Why you guys comment on someone you've probably never watched more than 2 minutes. Understand the freaking context. This guy is trolling 24/7 in his stream.
---
Had a well geared warrior asking for tank for WC. When I told him he could probably tank, he said, but I dont want to. Fair enough. But then we got a less experienced tank and we wiped a couple times. At this point, he dc dropped group.
---
Like, come on man, if you don't want to be patient with new players, just tank it yourself.
---
Addons like wow pro and questie?
---
Wait, isn't that the staff you need for the draenei mating ritual?
---
&gt;Almost certainly
---
I dont think you know what these words mean
---
At this point just use discord.
---
The 4 day record is based on using mechanics(exploits) that are no longer in the game.  You will not reach 60 in 4 days with layering gone, dungeon resets fixed, and a full guild behind you funding food/drink/etc.
---
Most guides will put you in the 6-7 days played ranges.
---
Cannot wait foir my tank to finally h it 60, /4 should just be renamed to /LFTank
---
Whitemain, not sure both sides seem packed
---
By replying to his comment and using implication you can safely assume that is what he means though.
---
and he's done
---
yes, you can backstab from her sides in front of tail
---
A true addict. Making excuses for his reasoning to play
---
All our mages are quitting. Surprise that spamming one key would get to them.

I found this guide and it looks pretty good...  [https://www.joanasworld.com/](https://www.joanasworld.com/) 
---
 What do you think?
---
Wow Athene, there's a name I haven't seen in years.
---
I honestly have no idea if he did ninja an item, I've just heard people say it and from the limited exposure I've had to his content it wouldn't surprise me if he did
---
I thought warlocks had best sustain in the game with their ability to convert health to mana and take mana from their pets etc
---
Disharmony of Flame is the 1st in the chain. I haven't done the trick you're looking to do, but it sounds like you want [What is going on?](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3982/what-is-going-on) and that's what you drop and pick up again.
---
I thought it was 4, but it might be 3.
---
Why would this get removed
---
In the announcement from yesterday he was only suspended, today they decided to fire him.
---
"But anyone who watches the entire end of the VoD can tell this guy has some mental problems"
---
wasnt even necessary, i saw it immediately in the second clip. that guy is on the path of insanity
---
Just can’t find a guild that wants to raid consistently on the times I’m looking for. Also had trouble making money as a tank...I will probably pick the warrior back up after a while.
---
It was a rhetorical answer.
---
Also, his knowledge of Vanilla is/was tenuous at best. The best part of that run (besides him ninjaing a cloak, deleting said cloak, and sending a clip of him deleting the cloak to his party members) was him, despite having severally damaged gear, a completely broken chest piece, a healer with 50-60% mana, and pulling without telling anyone, got two shot by the last boss in Wailing Caverns, and then reported the damage he took as a bug.... because he didn't know how hard that boss actually hit in Vanilla... Because he never played Vanilla, even though he liked to make everyone believe he was a subject matter expert.

And a poop bucket

Actually all 3 of the quests only give 50 rep. You have to do Frostsaber provisons 30 times (to 1500/3000 rep), then you just do Winterfall Intrusion (Furbolgs in Winterfall village) until you're capped out. It's the most efficient one, you try to always have a full party. You also get winterfall e'kos, runecloth, and winterfall firewater while you're here. There is also multiple RTV spawns at the turnin and this village, and multiple black lotus spawns at the turnin and the village.  Most things I read online said 200-210 hours, but that might have been soloing, so maybe 150-200 hrs.
---
There are addons that help. Questie shows you where to finish quests, for example. There are also leveling guides online that show you the best path for max exp per hour. Also, they don't sleep.
---
He's just cringeworthy and his life is completely out of control, not sure if he's the most arrogant
---
Oh ok that makes sense. So is there like a generally best accepted route?
---
Until reading this comment I hadn't even considered the fact that this clip could be satire, does anybody actually know? This clip could be taken out of context. He's a very good actor if it's satire though because this seems 100% genuine.
---
Is this part of Elvui? It is already tracking my heals.
---
Thanks
---
It's fucking stupid as hell. Heck, I invite other prot warriors to raids and just tell them 'put on dps gear, you can still roll on tank gear'. Like, who gives a fuck? The dude can do the reverse.
---
&gt; Azeroth auto pilot
---
There is an add-on that plays the game for you? That doesn't seem like fun at all
---
Justice.
---
Not saying it is one, but sounds like a good defense loophole to get around having to implement a feature they alluded to becoming available in Phase 2.
---
Yes, technically they said next patch which was assumed phase 2 -- but since they are not technically patching anything they now are in the clear to implement keyrings **SOON^^tm**, i.e. we probably won't see them until like phase 5 knowing blizzard.
---
nah. the dagger form dm:west and the offhand from ungoro quest give u 19shadow and 20spellpower. this staf for a lock does not mean dps upgrade.
---
And people thought layers were fixed size and tied to pop cap. Pretty obvious that there are more people in the final merged server than were on a single layer
---
Where are these servers where you get spammed with gold sellers? Is that only a problem in certain regions ? I don't think I ever saw an advert for gold selling in classic.
---
all booty is hunter booty
---
I saw a group last night looking for a tank for strath live with orbs reserved, and it didn’t sound like it was reserved for the tank.
---
SM/ruin is generally more DPS than DS/ruin right now since MC has more multi target fights than single Target, but you need to take up a debuff slot to deal the additional damage.
---
\+1 for the opening music :P
---
You can hug the left wall and not aggro any patrols or mobs on the road. Lowest level was 54 when we did this
---
My raid team has 7 rogues. We started doing some split Onys a couple weeks ago although this week we did a combined 40 man one. As a  raid team we have probably downed Ony close to ten times and have yet to have a Tier 2 rogue helm. Yet most of our priests/warlocks/druids/warriors all have helms and we are starting to DE. 
---
Fucking sucks man lol... seeing as I am one of these very unfortunate rogues.
---
I didn't know about this channel until I read about it somewhere, so don't feel bad.
---
Tip: Get the Puggle addon. It collects a list of all the LFG posts on all the major channels you have access to in an easy to read interface. So you don't always have to keep an eye on the channel and can stick to your group or guild channels without missing a thing.
---
If you're on the Alliance, Hardcore Casuals is looking for a few more people to fill in Raid Group 2, and we're starting to form our Raid Group 3, though that won't start for a while I'd guess. Raid Group 1 has MC and Ony on farm, and Raid Group 2 has gotten to Domo and killed Ony.
---
From my understanding you need a certain amount of contribution points in order to get to certain ranks, for example rank 2 requires you to have 2000 points while for rank 14 you need 60000.
---
The player that farmed the most honor in a certain week gets 13000 CP, which means the maximum rank anyone can achieve after the first week is rank 4. All other players receive less than 13k CP and the amount depends on how much honor they farmed in comparison to the other players.
---
grack?
---
Out of all the things to be bitching and crying about, you chose this.
---
God bless you, i hope you survive the winter.
---
Because it IS more than that, it's a time investment from everyone involved in the raid, and from the sounds of it most of those people are actually putting more time into it than you are, actually farming their pre-raid BiS and bringing consumables in.
---
Rolling is OK, but not on ANYTHING, there needs to be ground rules on items that are amazing for some Classes and literal trash for others, otherwise you end up with "all loot is hunter/war loot" and etc...
---
Resurrection only has one S as well though
---
&gt;the goal is to downrank as much as you can
---
The goal is to keep everyone alive
---
In six months half the people may have moved on to other things so it's pointless to look that far into the future. I have also seen many items go past me because of a lost roll but that's the way it goes. To me it's a game to play for fun and while I want good loot in the end it is what it is and I still have fun. I know that may be a crazy idea to many, just playing a game for fun, but that's how I look at it.
---
He did both but the outcome would be different without outrage I am certain.
---
That's relatable. Our main tank's wife has been sleeping with our raid leader. What's strange is he knows about it and is ok with it.
---
You only need a few pieces of FR, not a full set.
---
Your mitigation, threat and dps sets have a healthy amount of overlap among them. So that’s shouldn’t be 3 full sets, as implied.
---
There’s only 7 keys and 5 items from quests to access instanced/summon bosses (Scepter, Mallet, gnomer port,UBRS key and Ony neck).
---
Valor is only 8 pieces, and most likely a vanity set (so it taking up space is entirely on you, as it’s not necessary if you do a modicum of raiding in the next year).
---
So, let’s calculate.  Let’s assume you do actually have a 100% full set of gear for each set (16 slots each) with zero overlap.
---
That’s 64. Plus 12 for the “key” type items. 4 quest items. 8 Valor, and a smattering of engineering items (we’ll assume a full 16-slot bag, but I doubt it’s that many).
---
Your total is now 104 slots taken up. Your with a full bag of consumes (even though to play mail tag, we’ll add it), that’s 120. Your bank caps at 120 slots when using 16 slot bags (I doubt you’ve been lucky enough to get a bunch of Ony bags). So your bank is now full.
---
But we still have your characters bags. Your character caps at 80 slots (again, assuming 16 slots), which haven’t even been touched yet. What are these filled with? Safe to assume there’s some crafting materials. But are you filling those 80 slots with raw herbs/cloth/ore/etc?
---
This is giving you a solid amount of leeway with gear sets (you shouldn’t be taking up 64 slots for all of those sets). Do you not have all of your bank slots bought? Do you not have 16 slot bags? They aren’t that expensive compared to some items (I can buy a full set for my character and bank for the cost of raw materials for 1 weapon enchant on my priest). Even if you skimp and only get runecloth, that shorts you 20 slots which drops you to 180 of a potential 200. That’d be more important that getting worried  over a key ring that’ll free up 7 slots.
---
He god damn for sure reminds me of Athene, the king of controversy.  This is what drives viewership and I think itll help more than hurt in today's ever growing troll culture.
---
Yeah, we tested with hunter string, priest burn, and warlock drain.
---
Hunter string had no mana drained after shift. He thinks (the hunter) this is because the dot "checks" the form every tick. He tried explaining it to me and it kind of was gibberish haha. Not sure of the exact cause.
---
Priest burn works as I posted in my post above. Will continue to cast and go off after shift IF the cast for burn was started prior to shifting. Cannot cast if in bear/cat form.
---
I wasn't there for our warlock testing it so I can't really truthfully speak to that but the report I got was "working as normal". From the druid.
---
I am indeed. I’m just starting to feel I’m missing the real game with all this talk about bis this and bis that.

He asked how to hit 60 in 4 days, not what’s the best way to have fun.
---
Except Esfand is a quite salty dude that tries to cover it up as being a positive, happy guy. No thanks.
---
You can't cast Battle Stance when you're already in battle stance, nothing happens
---
He is a hacked private server scrub.
---
No shit, and yes it isn't a legal loophole as they have no contractual binding to do anything. 
---
But it does sound like a very scummy lawyery response to basically "Yeah we alluded to having this feature available in a misleading timescale, but we are ganna use this phrasing to give us all the time in the world to get around to it."  It just sounds like a courtroom answer to get out of any expectations.
---
If you mean 4 days in played time, you can just bank rested exp. Will take months to get to 60, but actual played time will be low.
---
you definitely get more as you level up, but it is surprisingly a pretty gradual increase.

I like the bold text. Makes you sound like you're not trolling

Touche

VANISH IS BROKEN.  This is a known problem for PVP rogues.  Blizz genuinely needs to fix this.
---
and share accounts.
---
Since that is a rhetorical comment I’m going to ignore it.
---
How do you know how much is needed and at what percentile? Also what’s your strat for farming honor? Raid groups in brm or small squads of a few ppl?
---
Yes it is. Truth hurts.
---
You also can get points for people as low as level 48 if you are level 60. Which makes it easy to go bank lower levels
---
It’s reddit. We need 5 posts minimum.
---
Yeh, if they want my raid geared tank to tank their 5 man, payment is.. pretty nice. I can't actually loot anything from any dungeon. I run more strat live than anything because they message me going 'hey, wanna run strat live, first orb yours?' 
---
Honestly, you're not even paying me to run the dungeon. You're paying me to not carry my guildies through the dungeon with my time and instead I'm ramming you head first through it.

 Phase 2 not even out
---
When it will go live? I thought it shoudl have been 11 Am.
---
I'm thinking of playing one because it's what I played in actual vanilla.
---
When people ask me to tank and then try to reserve an item, even if it's something I cannot wear they always get the same canned response from me.  "If you think you deserve any item more than someone who helps you get it, then you can try and get it solo" I then leave group.
---
Absolutely zero reserves are allowed for any role or class in my tanking runs.  I will not tolerate entitlement and greed ever.
---
Loads of people know. It's 3-5m groups ganking anyone above level 48 and camping flight paths.
---
on my server the only thing people (successfully) reserve is strat live orbs. A few days ago someone was trying to put together DM groups with Foror's on reserve and he just about got laughed out of all of the global channels
---
You only see outgoing heals of those who utilize any addon that uses healcomm libraries. If somebody uses default raid frame you won't see the outgoing heals of those healers.
---
These egregious out of game comparisons absurd. In no way can you compare in-game ninjaing with murder, that’s just stupid.

Tbh pserver players are usually better, but then there's a reason he's not in apes or progress

yeah I got insulted yesterday when I said it wouldn't just blow over for him.
---
Nice! i'm saving this
---
I get throwing a few bucks their way as a way to say thanks, but almost 1k? Fucking hell man
---
Not true. You can delete your character and then have a friend create a new one with your name, level him a little (get at least above 10), then submit a ticket with Blizzard and have your character restored due to "accidental deletion." Once restored you get a character with gibberish for a name and the opportunity to pick a new one.
---
For ninja looting and conduct unbecoming of a member of Method.
---
Good on them. I didnt expect it honestly.
---
You'll do great in Mara/ST and in a couple levels you should be fine to run brd.
---
You must have some very uninteresting friends, but I can believe that.
---
Hey, I too am a female on Sulfuras! Have a level 59 resto Druid and 33 holy Paladin. :)
---
Best method of boosting is to get three other characters around the same level as the one you are boosting.  Then AOE mobs in a dungeon.  Change the dungeon as you level up.  Best when the mobs are orange/yellow to the boosted character.
---
SM and ZF work really well for this.
---
its actually hilarious how much this clown cries about this, then goes on to say "its just a video game" "i didnt even need the item"
---
yeah bud we all know you were fucking steaming when your precious polygons got taken away from you
---
You know a kid would not be going straight everywhere and would jump often. Towards the end you can SEE how he glitches out by using mouse movement quickly
---
Hardware bans are a thing though, apex used them
---
Yeeah, i despise the guy like everyone else. But that was either some lame impersonation or taken out of context
---
&gt; Same here. Just don't see Blizzard doing it, under the guise of "not wanting to break up the community". But really it'll be financially motivated.
---
I think they'll do it, just like they did classic.
---
They win (plenty of players on private BC/WOTLK realms), we (BC/WOTLK fans) win, everybody wins. Why not.
---
I think they both do, it increases your Mana Regen by a certain % and allows 100% of it to continue while casting.
---
Right? You get the raw int/stam/spirit bonus, but the 1h mageblade comes stacked with 40 dmg/healing &amp; 1% crit which (imo) is way stronger than getting 20 int and some stam/spirit.
---
Still leaves open your offhand which can stack more stats. Such a good weapon.
---
Grinding dungeons non stop with a group of same level characters, all communicating well to be as efficient as possible. Oh, and not sleeping or logging off either.
---
Overpower
---
Considering he only recently partnered with method. He could be making a lot of money, and just hasn’t seen it yet.
---
Sorry :( I didn’t even realize I was trying to win so badly!
---
I actually don't mind that one. If you're creating and running a dungeon over and over again just for a cosmetic, I don't think it's wrong to have it reserved. 
---
Plus, it's very unlikely that it even drops, so no one is really missing out on anything.
---
Cool for the first day but if you're still boasting about it over a month later that's just pathetic.
---
Better than no friends.
---
Like I said, that's their perogative if they want a harder group forming experience.
---
&gt;or he is gold farming so he can buy it.
---
Hahahahahahaha, a prot warrior gold farming... hahahahahahahahaha
---
&gt; Everyone and their moms made a gnome mage and tries to be jokerd
---
Or just it's the most optimal alliance race lol.
---
He's being realistic and reasonable, you're just being an asshole.
---
Rested exp lasts until you use it all. You can store up to 30 bubbles (1 level and a half) of rested exp. It takes 8 hours to fill one bubble, so to get capped rested exp, it would take 10 days.
---
This is a decent way to level an alt, but wouldn't recommend it for your main character.
---
The basic rule for macros is that each button press can only trigger the global cooldown once. So anything which triggers the 1s global cooldown will require its own button press.
---
Using items triggers the global cooldown so would require a button press per item.
---
Slightly random question, do WF totem procs show up on raid parses?  Curious to see what % of total damage would be from it.
---
Justice served lol.
---
Serious question: What constitutes a dishonorable kill?
---
blizzard support doesnt do jack shit in classic. I deleted the scholo key on accident thinking it was a left over quest item. In game item restoration doesnt work so I just gave up after multiple attempts. I didn't find out item restoration works from the web (not ingame) until it was too late.
---
I opened a ticket and blizzards exact words were, and I quote:  "too fucking bad shithead. Go fuck yourself"
---
Method booted him. Blizzard did nothing. Who’s laughing now?
---
I don't think its a better vanilla experience as most quests were super vague as to where you might accomplish them or if you're like me and you have a quest in your log that you forgot where you picked it up, it will also tell you where it turns in (provided you can find that on your map and it's completed.) Questie won't auto accept quests or turn in (by default iirc) so you can still read the quests and get that part of the world.
---
I actually don't mind that one. If you're creating groups and running a dungeon over and over again just for a cosmetic, I don't think it's wrong to have it reserved. 
---
You should be just fine for healing. Heal some when you are a bit underleveled and then when you get some drops and a couple of levels you can tank too.
---
I just looked it up and it’s not so quit your bullshit and be more aware please :)
---
I got it pretty clear. If you recognize the meme "That Man? Albert Einstein" its pretty easy to spot, but if you don't know the meme I could understand the confusion.
---
Beside the fact that nobody cared about darnassus at all xD but yeah nice "out-maneuver"
---
I'm also on AR, it's not a dead server, this dude is just being dramatic. It's def not like this but we have several raiding guilds full clearing, wpvp that doesn't crash your server, no ques, and plenty of dungeon groups.
---
If people would quit calling it a dead server more may be willing to xfer here. We have more players than a vanilla server with a 55/45 faction balance. AR is a great place to be.
---
back in vanilla we would 15man it lol
---
I like to use auction house listing as a metric because it’s something you can easily check on your server.
---
Horde auction house regularly has around 7000 listings. 
---
Neutral AH has largely died off - I think there are around 100 items, maybe less.
---
Except it’s under investigation? Obviously if he did something terrible then he would be removed.  But even suggesting it could be sexual assault is pure speculation. Nothing has ever been said outside of the fact his twitch account is under investigation
---
Holy shit its thursday haha sorry I woke up thinking its wednesday
---
Yeah, it's baffling... I'm also pretty sure the +30 spell power enchant only works on one-handed weapons, so he gimped himself there, too. 
---
Even an BoE AH dagger with that enchant on it + aquamentas is better than that staff LMAO
---
Funnily enough in germany it's called rezz
---
AndyPyro has 236,000 followers on Twitch. Not sure where this 500-1000 number is coming from. Maybe they means subscribers? In which case that would be a solid monthly income. He has a contract with Method and sponsorships on top of that.
---
Well, you're right about the second part.
---
Mages, hunters (pets with a Chinese symbol name or no name at all give it away in combination with the usual), i saw another Dwarf warrior too. They actually worked together because they just tab target whatever they see
---
I believe that he is referring to the spell power flask
---
I doubt he has the capacity for those kind of feelings.
---
I always play with a warrior. There have been a few times I wasn't invited to groups while I was in cheetah form because they thought he was a hunter and I was a pet.
---
You're entitled to your opinion, but good luck on redefining the rules of commerce and property worldwide.
---
If you're resisting a lot you're probably not farming in the right place.
---
quiet literally you get 3 extra spell hit to reduce resists and all the places you are suppose to farm don't have by any means heavy frost resistance. Even if they **did** resists all you do is walk away and rest. 
---
You shouldn't be "Tanking" **any** hits because it shortens the duration of Channel Blizzard, like all channel spells.
---
Also it isn't hard to not mess up, quiet literally Nova, Blizz, Blizz, Repeat. If your Nova resists no amount of extra mana will recover that, that's either a reset or Cold Snap Re-Nova. No in between of "well I can get hit a little" because if you are getting hit, you're losing Blizzard cast time and if you're losing Blizzard cast time, your Nova won't be up. If your Nova isn't up by the time the 2 blizzard's are done you accept your death (or try to save with iceblock or w/e but optimally you want IB on CD because you are using it for big pulls) not really any in between. 
---
Also your competition isn't the enemy faction only, If you think this you've never seen a farm spot. It's your own faction you're competing and evry gnome mage with some variant name of "JOKERD" or Undead Mage. 
---
Stamina and Int are still next to useless. 
---
Also in Mage vs. Mage at low level you don't win by "Have more health" both your manas are subpar and healths are low. Mage PvP is literally, hide till you see them pull, kill them mid Blizzard, then you try to AOE farm only for him to do the same exact shit you did to him to you.
---
You would know all of this if you Maged AOE farmed.
---
Jokerd threw his career under the bus by ninja looting this staff. He got kicked from Method after that. He was probably earning a nice chunk of money by being with Method. Now that hes been kicked because of his stupidity, he will not earn as much as he was suppose too. Thats why OP said the staff is the most expensive item in WoW.
---
Our Mages and Locks won't touch SoD since it pretty much means they won't ever see a Mageblade, which is immensely better. We've seen 5 SoD.  Our druid healers and our multibox lock (he only takes unwanted loot) were the only ones who were even interested in them.
---
I don't disagree with you giving it to a DPS who doesn't care to compete with 14 other Mageblade holdouts, but I think a (non priest) healer should be given an even shot at it.  It's a very good staff for a healer.
---
Tellmewhen
---
think of the saline content BAH GAWD
---
He cheated leveling anyway
---
I agree.
---
It's pretty much the same for every dungeon. Knowing what packs to pull, when to pull them, where to pull them, etc... to achieve maximum efficiency obviously has a huge impact on the time it takes to clear any given dungeon or raid.
---
I think OP's intent was to give a list of average time it takes to clear each dungeon, not a definitive list of record for the fastest a dungeon has been clear with a "perfect" group and the slowest a dungeon has been cleared by a bunch of clowns dealing with narcolepsy...
---
Phase 1, multibox 40 characters on each faction to 60.   Phase2, find some secluded place and farm yourself.
---
This was glorious.
---
The dogs?
---
Ressing has two though
---
Well, I think if you bound everything to hotkeys and used OCR for health, mana, enemy health / mana, what color it’s nameplate is when it gets near, you could make a fairly intelligent bot with just checking colors
---
I’m with you, but after basically nothing happened to Royson are you surprised?  
---
It seems like most of the top streamers are sketchy/ninjas/general assholes and nobody seems to care.  I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.
---
Imagine being a fresh 30 to stv. That was a bloodbath before

---
Reason =/= Excuse
---
Youre already wrong because people who land from a fp are honorless.  You just proved mrbadpudge correct.
---
I often get that when I give out fort and I must say thank you. A buff is a buff. We must all do our part for the horde.
---
"Hey thanks for your $900 donation! Anyway, back to what I was doing"
---
It doesn't *actually* play the game for you, it just tells you how to play it.
---
Your point still stands, the lack of discovery or challenge of finding things on your own does diminish that brand of fun, just wanted to point out its not a botting program or anything.
---
I abstained from using a questing addon until level 54, and then I kind of hit a wall and broke down and installed Questie.
---
and that's a career wrap, see ya at mcdonalds drive thru
---
Does method need help setting up a blog so they can do pr like this without using Twitlonger?
---
Nah that's the red/purple one but you're thinking of the right quest lol
---
How does a holy paladin kill someone in pvp?
---
They don't, their warrior does.
---
If they don't have a warrior then their rogue/warlock/mage/hunter/shadow priest/druid does.
---
What a cockjizz
---
It's a LOT different if you join a group to farm a specific item,  obviously, and if you're running with people who are already geared and just grinding gold, clearly they see things differently. 
---
I'm talking about the vast majority of regular dungeon pugs, where a lucky upgrade dropping is just that for someone - lucky,  same way rnjesus does all drops.  The immediate value of an actual upgrade for someone is different than the potential value of an upgrade for someone else who might have to wait a few days or weeks and work the market to see any real value from it.  I'd just rather be a good teammate than focus only on the size of my wallet. 
---
But again,  the solution is just to set the guidelines before the run starts.
---
How many posts do we need of this nonsense?
---
He sure can, unless that rogue is undead in P1 and neither of them have a trinket
---
He already said Hotpockets
---
I mean not him? If he was using the game as an actual form of compensation, he;s out literal cash for this stupidity.
---
Lol, it's very good. If you're min maxing, no its not the best, but it's still a very good item
---
In Wrath I always enjoyed sitting on a mailbox in town in my bird form.
---
I don't even care about flight, I just enjoyed being Birdman.
---
Damn that doesn’t sound that efficient unless you do it with multiple characters... Still 10 days for one and a half levels? I mean I dont know...
---
Travel with another rogue.
---
Im...  I'm thriving! I've never got to thrive before

---
0-60 in record timing. Well played friend. Remind me not to get on your bad side.
---
HOW CAN SHE BIRD
---
this is bait
---
I have a buddy who was excited for classic, told me he was stoked to play a mage and AoE powerlevel because it was the "most efficient." 
---
Turns out spamming blizzard/frost nova/blizzard/blizzard/drink ad infinitum is a lot less fun than doing quests and dungeons, and the guy burned out in his mid 30s.
---
It's funny because in this case, it is actually 100% wrong.
---
I played Vanilla, I had my tier 2 wrath sharkfin helm WELL before the AQ event began.
---
I got my own T2 helm in October 2005, which is months before AQ released (Jan 2006).  Therefore, at the absolute latest the models were updated 2 months before patch 1.9, but it was likely well before that.
---
MOOOOOMMMMM
---
With the above cooldowns used and an undead rogue lock wont even get deathcoil off
---
Without being at my gaming computer at this moment, I'll give you limited info from my memory.
---
None of my stance macros have the [nostance] tag (I'm a simple man). When I press the key to cast a stance I'm already in (cast Battle Stance while in Battle Stance) nothing happens -- no icon above my head, no animation. I have done this while testing my macros, so I'm sure nothing (visual) seems to happen. 
---
I know I have, while in actual combat, cast a stance I was already in, and though it wasn't a test, so I wasn't specifically watching my rage, I didn't notice a difference (didn't lose abilities that were ready). So I doubt rage drops. In fact, thinking more about it, I'm pretty sure I'm using at least a couple macros that change my stance to X stance on my X stance action bar. Like my "change to Berserker Stance and use Whirlwind" macro is on both my Defensive Stance and Berserker Stance action bars.
---
DM east no problem...west even if group knows what their doing.. North is even difficult sometimes at 60 so just depends on group comp. Also dunno what role u are but if healing definitely can always get away with being lower lvled
---
Thanks Ted, that was the joke.
---
RIP in peace
---
Mageblade dropped every week for your guild? Pretty lucky
---
Yeah normally I think the “removed for low effort” thing is kinda bs but this is a whole new level
---
Oh cool.  He respects Method. 
---
Too bad he doesn't respect women.
---
Look at what you're defending jesus christ.
---
Do random groups with people. If you're unguildied and don't suck you will get asked by the end of the dungeon, every time...
---
Yeah, not happening.
---
From my experience it's the most terrible players who advocate against addons, either because they are too stupid to use them or don't realize what they can do.
---
Yeah and how many people top a weekly ladder each week...? Lol
---
Just play and get used to it.
---
you can LEECH to 60 in under 4 days sure. but you can't do it under your own power without the mechanics he mentioned
---
the guy i replied to literally said "gear doesn't matter much for an AoE mage"  
---
So, that guy was.
---
Sounds like he's trying to be the next Athene.
---
Who wouldve thought that someone that's been aoe blizzarding mobs for 10 years is not a completely stable person.
---
I remember being a kid, seeing the placeholders for T2, and thinking how cool it would be to wear some black or red dragon-themed gear on my hunter.
---
Pink.
---
The bad answer is that I haven't had much luck or experience with hunters. We don't have that many hunters in raid and they don't really duel that often so I don't have a real good footing for fighting them.
---
Ofc it matters. Also warriors are way better in TBC then in vanilla.
---
No such luck here OP. The wife isn't much of a gamer really. Got her to try out retail last year and she enjoyed smashing things on a warrior for a couple months. Tried to get her into classic, but it didn't take her long to decide it was too boring and tedious for her liking. That stint in retail was her first MMO experience, so she has zero of the nostalgia that pulls me in to Classic.
---
Oh, the ‘ol “it’s just a game” fallacy. Well, what else can you respond with when you’re justifying stupidity?
---
I tried on a 60, maybe that's why it didn't work.
---
Now imagine how much cam girls are getting paid
---
Idk I did a lot of full runs when I was leveling my priest, and I know that dungeon like the back of my hand. Sub 3 hours was pretty consistent, and it was good XP/hr and there's a ton of priest BiS in there (especially before DM dropped).
---
The dungeon isn't *that* convoluted, it's pretty easy. It's just the standard arena-&gt;golem run, drop down after the bar, do the fire elemental, fineus, vault, and the caster guy by the shadowforge key statue. Then, you just go back to flamelash and Tot7 -&gt; emp.
---
Bael/interrogator can be added before arena (assuming you have the key), and same with roccor/houndmaster but there's just no reason to really do those two.
---
I see where you're coming from,  though I vehemently disagree that the size of your wallet is one of the most important things in vanilla - ask any guild lead if they'd rather have more money or more reliable players.
---
My argument is that an upgrade item dropping for someone has real,  immediate value. Whereas people just looking to sell has vastly different value based only on potential.  Maybe the person who wins the item isn't great at marketing and just puts the item up for a quick sell,  and it goes for well below market value - that's a lot different than someone who knows the server economy getting top dollar for it,  which is why we talk about the item only having potential value.  Not to mention that getting gold is only half the equation - that person might not be able to purchase an upgrade for a few days or weeks,  so there's even less value given the time it took to turn that liquidity into a new asset.
---
An upgrade for someone who can use it has real value,  everyone wanting to get some gold to make get an upgrade in the future has potential value. 
---
Need&gt;Greed.
---
Yeah I was thinking more group PvP, so you can survive for longer while you have a teammate come help kill whoever is on you.
---
Oh shit, they done goofed

 When will you people noone wnats to transfer to your shitty small servers where nothing happens and lotuses sell for 15g. People want big realms where main things are happening, best players are etc, you saying this is player's fault is beyond stupid and you are part of the problem of why Blizzard has luxury of giving shitty service to its players.

#burnthetree

Bro... watch"Asmongold reacts to how much streamers make" on YT.
---
I think asmongold is the scum of the earth and absolute filth but the video is pretty insane. 
---
They make WAY fucking more than you think.
---
I used to play a wrath PS during the weekly 10 hour maintenance in 2011.
---
Dire Maul East, sure. I'd say 53 is a little low for West and North though.
---
You know throwing shade isn’t factual right?
---
Most if not all healers can have on-crit effect of some value. Then add that usually spell crit shows up with other caster stat and you end up with per item decision making. Like Robe of volatile power would go to locks and then maybe to palas that don't want to be tuqoise? Rdruid in our mc wanted to roll on the golemag staff as it's bis but rage quit after hearing it's caster prio ;) (small upgrade for him, bigger for casters too)
---
Everytime I join a random group for scholo, I ask if its ok when I (priest healer) roll need on them, never had an issue with it. One time A lock needed them also for raiding, dunno if he was trolling or not.
---
But I dont reserve them, I just ask when we entry the dungeon. I even ask when I am with my mates (mostly casters) x)
---
I think people are memeing him so hard because it was so god damn stupid. Like twitch is (regardless of how you feel about it) a good way to make money playing video games, and it's incredibly accessible to people which is a huge plus. It's hard to get a following, he spent a week going full no-life and was rewarded with a burst of attention, and a moderate following (classic wow twitch community is focused around a couple of big names) which he could have leveraged into just playing video games for a career. I mean shit Method is a big name in video games, getting that partnership or whatever is huge for gamers looking to make money off the hobby.  Then he throws it away for a staff of dominance, which I have on my mage and know I'm going to replace at some point. Idk it was just a goofy ass decision, so it's incredibly easy to make fun of him for it.
---
No fucking way. The only reason he did it that fast was layers and warlocks summoning him.and people helping him.  With out any of that he would absolutely not.
---
There is no evidence he cheated. There is no evidence he cheated. Is it cheating if it can be done by anybody?
---
LET HIM CLUE YOU IN, BITCH.
---
Chat box, right of screen :)
---
He never really had anything.  There is no future in being a Classic wow streamer only.
---
well either way he still needs tl buy a mageblade anyway even after the ninja
---
most of the popular streamers either play well enough or have enough fan's they can just get whatever they want
---
I have never played BFA and I’m still mad about that

Its not an Esports. Or at least not a good one.

Anything can be a sport. It just needs real competition, competitors training, organisations funding and a returning crowd.

No-one is going to tune in to basement dwelling Jesus do a speed-run every week.

PvE **is not an Esports**. That’s why we don’t make grandmaster chess players regularly go against AI, or AI against AI. Sports **is PvP**.
---
I’m not saying WF and speedruns aren’t entertaining, just not entertaining or should be classified as an Esports. Ever. No-one wants to watch Michael Jordan just shoot a basket in an empty court and call that his career.

Oh, I have been gathering +healing for the whole game too. Not everyone has, and I was looking for another Shaman who was being drafted to heal in SM. I'm sure you can do fine healing there, even as Enhance, but that's just what I saw.

That describes everyone who *isn't* a douche to you? Are you dumb or just depressed and projecting?

I always have the urge to need because it i see something locked I have a strong urge to open it. But, I greed and offer to open instead. 
---
I do open locked chests though. I peek inside, if I don't want/need the item I'll post in party chat to see if someone wants. Rolling on locked chests is a complete waste of time imo.

---
Good God. Allyroute had me in STV for the early thirties. Even before phase 2 level 60s camped quest hubs. Once I hit 48 and actually am worth something.. dear god
---
It's basically forever, there's what - 8 or 9 quests for the mobs mages farm? It's ok, you can be wrong.
---
Good luck lol. My guild needs to finish Domo/Rag before reset. Im Northshore GM of Evocati
---
You are all welcome for my loot hacks, tips appreciated ofc
---
If you’re lucky
---
Except you can actually read the original patch notes from 1.9 
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060323023349/http://worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch1p9.html
---
Note the date: 
---
&gt; World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.9.0 (2006-01-03).
---
Under items: 
---
&gt; All of the Tier 2 Class Armor sets have been updated with new art. 
---
So yes, you are wrong. They were updated on January 3rd, 2006, in 1.9, the same patch that Ahn'Qiraj was released.
---
I stepped up to do mine and saw another priest same faction fail his. So... I invite him to group, we accept the quest as a party and one talks to Eris to start the quest and the other accepts the quest as ‘starting’. Whomever spoke to eris to begin the quest is able to go toward the cave, move around and heal and cleanse as you normally would. Second priest can assist by standing still on eris and tossing heals and cleanses to the peasants allowing the first priest to get back up to the new spawns and you both can easily use higher rank renews and flash heals at your leisure. Quest succeeds and you both complete at the same time. Super easy, no need to trade off with someone who is failing and waste time waiting for respawn. So if you are struggling, hang out on the hill for a while during post raid times and I’m sure you can get it done that way. Can group up to five priests at a time this way too if there are people all milling around waiting for their chance to complete... or farm in epl and go to eris when you see her annoying yell start to spring up and check for a friendly quest doer too.

---
For reference.   
---
If anyone has the time to do it, please check for people who commented back then and now. Would love to see that
---
Time to start from Lakeshire and hug the mountains to try to sneak into BRM from the Burning Steppes side.
---
I would. IMO, prot is definitely the way to go. Anger Management is irreplaceable and i could not play without it. The snap aggro is great with Prot too. You will not do as much DPS as prot, but prot is about controlling the fight not being a damage dealer. If you have an MMO mouse bind the stances to a button on your mouse and it makes dancing so much easier.
---
As a mage trying to level in BRD from 56+, can confirm.
---
Ah yes the default response to someone who knows that's exactly what they are.
---
Um what? That's like saying PVP has been non-existant until the Honor patch that dropped TODAY... Most players have killed hundreds/ been killed hundreds of times prior to this honor patch. 
---
What in the world do you mean by "back in 2004" when honor system wasn't added until April 2005 "
---
That is entirely irrelevant to his original post lol. He is stating the involvement of PVP has always been around since the launch, we merely only started getting "benifits" from it in 2005.
---
Could you care to name a “ton” of bugs that have been fixed?
---
This is the biggest bait lmao
---
Is anyone getting odd glitches: loading screens that freeze, freezing when opening the game at "Logging in to game server", and once in game suddenly being unable to interact with npcs, and player character names are shown as "Unknown".  Started happening yesterday, never had any issues before.
---
Get an authenticator and if you actually have reasonable travel time between the locations you should be fine. A lot of the complaints your see are actually people that cheated or boosted and are just trying to drum some controversy and get their account back. Like people who log into their account from the US then a couple hours later there is a log in from eastern Europe. There is often other suspicious activity. You should be fine if it's just a nearby city, I do that all the time.
---
Its good, but you got to pay for that one i think. The exact same guide is copy pasted everywhere but free
---
he said that he didn't use layering until the end but that's bs, guess the story changed too cause his first time mentioning that was for the last *six* levels, not 2. I always thought it was bs though, the sheer sheep in which he leveled involved day one layering abuse. He is not some computer AI btw.. there are a LOT of people who can out level him in terms of speed after years of practice, yet this guy is magically just way and beyond everyone else, including other notable level speedrunners who began the game at the same time, and matched their previous records to 60, except they chose to ignore layering abuse.
---
Honestly, everyone in the know reaped from it. Including abusing the raid boss respawn to farm gear (Was a shaman in full tier 1 less than 3 weeks after classic released).
---
Farming consumables in instances with reset as well.
---
compared to all the try-hards at 5 viewers, yeah, but having 500-1000 avg viewers during livestream is still pretty low
---
at that point you reallllly want other forms of income
---
That isn't ninjalooting though.
---
If everyone rolls greed and he rolls need it's won fair and square. That would simply be a fail of those who need it. The only way to ninja an item is through masterloot as it's the only way to appoint loot to a specific person.
---
Ok, I’ll check them out, mind control looks to be the most fun spell on a PvP server
---
What has asmongold ninja'd? A fkin Teebu's dropped yesterday while he had master loot amd you know what he did? rolled it off
---
Sad. It'll come back to him. You're literally taunting world boss life to come put you on your knees.
---
Professionally I represent my company and can definitely be fired for wrongdoings in that respect. To a much larger degree players in Method represent Method and you could say most of their job is representing Method. It's not a "punishment", they're just covering their ass and rightly so.
---
This comment is gold. Unfortunately, I have no gold to give you.
---
&gt;utterly incapable of empathy.
---
Yep. You got me, I’m actually a Psychopath with little to no emotions because I think PvE is not an Esports. Exactly. That rash generalisation definitely makes me
---
one with &gt;very narrow viewpoint
---
Fucken nice one mate.
---
Like learning more about the game!
---
I used to challenge to a duel, and then forfeit it while they were attacking or about to attack.   Bam they get flagged and i kill them.
---
Staff of Dominance? Sounds like a shitty system, I'd be pretty pissed too considering most casters prefer mageblade but druids can't use swords. Probably wouldn't want to raid with that guild if it was me either.
---
"Master Looter was used as the looting method and rules were not clearly established.
---
Loot Scams
---
When a Master Looter establishes clear rules for specific loot distribution using channels that are visible to all players (such as party chat or raid chat) then breaks those rules by distributing the loot differently, Blizzard considers it a loot scam.
---
If a Master Looter refuses to honor a specific agreement, you can contact Support to report that player for scamming. Include details about the rule established and how it was broken. Blizzard will review the chat logs and may suspend the player or remove items depending on the findings.
---
Due to the privacy associated with these investigations, we will not release details regarding an investigation's findings or any actions taken against other players. Loot removed during a scam investigation will typically be left unassigned.
---
To minimize the risk of looting disputes:
---
Understand how each loot setting in the game works. This will ensure the group uses the most compatible setting.
---
Be attentive when you join a new dungeon or raid group. Many times, players who believe they have been scammed simply missed or misinterpreted the looting rules or expectations set forth by the group leader.
---
Verify the loot setting selected by the group leader when you join a new group or raid. Discuss any concerns with your group members and clarify what additional loot rules may apply. If the conversation leaves you uncomfortable or confused, decline the invitation or leave the group.
---
Group with players you trust whenever possible. If you aren't ready to trust the other players yet, Master Looter and Free-for-All aren't the right loot settings for you."
---
Try again.

---
He's a streamer.............
---
at the front of the entire race................................... making the most money, getting the most subs.................. 
---
............................who stopped streaming......................................
---
.......................while still leveling. 
---
Many times.
---
Stop advertising for him.
---
Word for word
---
No way!!! I live reddit
---
while at the same time a lvl 57 isn't complete dead weight here.
---
500-1000 viewers at one time means his overall audience is many times larger than that. If an ad plays on his stream a few times per day it will be seen by several thousand people.
---
And arguably knowing that you are advertising to as niche a group as WoW fanatics, and that you have the subject of their attention personally endorsing your stuff, makes the individual views a lot more valuable.
---
Holy shit lmao
---
More int = more blizzard casts. 
---
More int = higher crit chance = better CoC casts. 
---
Did someone shit in your coffee this morning or something? Most people probably know that blizzard doesn't crit or gain much more than ~50% of SP, but you're insane if you think int isn't needed for AoE farming. What happens if you can't cast that last blizzard or CoC or FN or AE?
---
Quick, someone not poor gild this comment for visibility. This needs to happen
---
Method and Jokerd probably.
---
You can just join a PUG as a shadow. MC is not difficult, so it could be fine. Also, a lot of guild already gave all their priests the weapon, so you might ask for a spot to have the 50% chance of getting it (for some gold in exchange of course)
---
Item Rack. Works like a charm.
---
Watched the video of that comment. Yes, that is what he actually said
---
I'm a little worried about accidentally leaving an important file out of the release. 3 minutes into posting I realized I left some unnecessary files in the zip (my .git folder for anybody wondering). Other than that there's nothing else to it.
---
Dus gon be a good meme
---
Yup, word for word. Guy is legit living up inside his own butthole.
---
I mean that in the time it would take to farm the needed honor (especially with only wpvp available), one could farm much more than 100g.
---
I was in the same boat. Got Rhok’Delar a week before Broken Tooth. Funny thing is I never farmed him or even searched more than once. It was late one night, I was lazy after solo farming tributes and my Hearth was set to Kargath for raid. So I hearth, say ‘screw it let’s go check’ and oh holy shit balls there he was.
---
Leveling the bastard is a whole other dilemma. My Broken Tooth is sitting at lvl55.
---
Wow never thought of that.   I'd be so confused if i fell for that.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
---
"What is Staff of Dominance worth?"
---
"Nothing."
---
"Everything."
---
Hello everyone, I am seeking a macro command who target the target of my actual target (wow much target lol)
---
Do this command exist?
---
Specially since we have a way better guide for free.
---
&gt;Jesus Christ, what a run-on.  You should be banned from using commas.
---
I normally roll my eyes when spelling or grammar is corrected, but I guffawed at that.
---
I mean, even if he got compensated he still got kicked off entirely?
---
Should I transfer to a non pvp server while leveling or something??
---
HAHA. Serves him right! now cue the fanbois crying
---
He did admit to using the N-word casually with friends and he doesn't do that anymore, not because he thinks it is wrong just because he doesn't want to say it accidentally on stream.
---
You have some great dagger options in phase 1 &amp; 2 - Heartseeker, Scarlet Kris, The Shadowfoot Stabber, Bonescraper, Felstriker, Gutgore Ripper, Core Hound Tooth and Perditions Blade.
---
In phase 3 you get access to Dragonfang Blade from BWL and The Lobotomizer from AV as well.
---
Mine is supporrive and says she loves watching me enjoying myself playing. That being said, I told her to let me know if I get too addicted and need to tone it down. She should be able to let me know if I'm going off the deep end without feeling bad for ruining my enjoyment of the game.
---
Yeah man, Asmongold does the same thing and his career is over. 
---
Wait, no it isn't.
---
Man that's a great copypasta.  Ripe for the pickin.
---
20% drop split between 15+ people is rare considering you only have a chance at it once a week.
---
Hey that's a 200% increase.
---
Trying to get into (good) dungeon groups is not easy as enhance either. I’m deep resto but I leveled enhance until ZF, never played a shaman in Vanilla so it was somewhat of a new experience for me. I don’t know a polite way to say it but Enhance is one of the worst specs in the game at everything and people considering deserve to hear that instead of “enhance is fine play what you like.” I get that people should play what they enjoy but most people don’t enjoy being a meme spec that struggles to find a group. Your solo farm ability is among the worst as well, and in PvP you have some success in small scale fights or duels but are much better off playing ele/resto. It’s not elitist or over the top to say that Enhance is good at literally nothing above other specs. If you enjoy it that’s fine but we should also be realistic about how it compares to other specs objectively.
---
He's not wrong. He can do what ever he wants, but he will pay the price.
---
scripted
---
Apparently joker cared so much he gave up a career of streaming for method
---
I played as "Pooncrusher" for a few years before I ultimately quit. Never got a name change!
---
Lol you got so offended over a sarcastic comment that it’s almost sad. It was pretty clear my comment and most of my other comments on this post have been entirely sarcastic, sorry you can’t take a joke
---
He gone: https://twitter.com/Methodgg/status/1194999611250876416
---
Kicked.
---
Anytime I see a posture/hydration check in /world I always follow it with an energy drink/comfy slouch check. Relaxed gamers ready for a night of nonstop gaming represent.
---
lol jesus get over it, everyone hates your guts for multiboxing except your friends who dont want to end the friendship over it but they look forward to the day that you stop. its cheating. 
---
your cute little "argument" also applies to twinks which i imagine many people also think is not cheating (those people are twinks). What you want to pretend to not see is the fact that you are walking around in a game where you are invincible, and nobody else is invincible. Nobody gives a shit if you spent your entire life working hard on this stupid goal, in fact they will hate you more because of it. 
---
The most important thing is that you are walking around one-shotting people and there is nothing they can do about it. That makes the game shitty for everyone else and I guess if you have a brain that doesnt work right then that is not easy to understand or empathize with. Have fun giggling like a child to yourself as people angrily shrug at you asking wtf is wrong with your life that you would do this
---
Guy who plays wow all day long as a career has mental problem? Well I never..!
---
Epic
---
You've read incorrectly, the post is about Limited Invulnerability, not Lesser Invisibility.
---
Yup we are ready for it. We plan to start moving in packs at all times and going to raid as a 40 man. All go in at once and fight to the death to get to MC.
---
I can't help but laugh at this tool. 
---
Ninja loot? whatever, you're an ass and I'll move on. But the *WAY* he did it was horrible.
---
Stop using literally incorrectly!
---
&gt; I’m not engineering anything
---
You aren't understanding what I'm saying. You're starting with the premise that the source of the problem is related to Blizzard only caring about money and working the problem back from that premise rather than just looking at the facts objectively. If you just assume that Blizzard will let people break the rules for a sub fee then it's easy to see why you'd make the assumption that Blizzard is overlooking bot's for the purpose of greed. 
---
Look at the facts objectively and let the evidence lead you to your conclusions rather than starting with a conclusion and allowing confirmation bias to mold the way you view the evidence.
---
&gt; I’m just curious as to how banning them in waves helps.
---
Did you even read the last paragraph I wrote? I literally broke it down for you in it's entirely as to why they do it and how it helps.
---
Literally all of them.  
---
The only realms that have a balanced or alliance majority are the Medium ones because of the free transfers, and the RPPVP.
---
Basically this sub is cool with anything pre-cata I’ve noticed. Not complaining though
---
Please let me post this joke next time :(
---
EPL is mostly 55+.  Not always an easy kill.  Un'Goro for days.
---
Run BRD until your eyes bleed...everyone likely needs gear there (unless RNG was extremely good) and will need to run 100 times anyways.  XP for all and BiS gear potential for all.
---
Wow, all that because he got to 60 layer abusing? Damn, what a pos .
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/2563
---
You would be nice to our future computer overlords. That other guy is definitely getting killed by the machines.
---
going to war :D
---
I'm so fucking sick of this excuse for twitch idiots.  Most of them are just assholes that got their 15 minutes and it made them even larger assholes
---
Thanks for the insight.  I don't think we'll be getting into anything that crazy like fury/prot just yet, the guild is still relatively new to support something like that; or is it?  I know the build, but I imagine there's some logistics that the rest of the raid has to observe for it to work out.
---
orc rogues are a lot better for rogue rogue encounters, so a lot of people run with that
---
&gt;  But nothing they're doing is that strange once it's clearly communicated.
---
Yeah, this is really the crux of the issue. Communicate better and people won't be confused. Communicate better and people won't have false expectations dashed.
---
DM:N Tribute is like a training mission for hunters. To do that dungeon well you have to:
---
* Kite 4 mobs at once that are faster than you
---
* Master controlling your pets position
---
* Execute your burst combo on a mob while you're moving and watching another target
---
* Learn to use feign death perfectly and figure out all of its quirks
---
I feel like DM:N solo could replace the Rhok'delar quest and it would be super satisfying. When i first made it though that and started farming it, it was insanely satisfying.
---
If your job is playing said video game then negative actions taken wile playing said video game should have consequences along the same lines.
---
I see no issue.
---
You're an idiot, the TOS is the same dumbass.
---
Think you overestimate how many people actually care. No one is gonna have any trouble finding a guild just cause they ninja'd shit.
---
Same thing here with my SO. She does not get video games at all. lol
---
Honorless target upon ressing at body, iirc
---
Gotta death ball
---
Notice how you pointed out 0 mechanics that require dps to have high health pools to live through. Again this game is 15 years old and the content has all been min maxed for over a decade. It’s not some galaxy barin concept.
---
/assist (name) will target the target of the player name you include in the macro, works in raid for everyone to list the 'main assist' name there so everyone is attacking the correct target. I dont know but perhaps there is a command for /assist 'target'
---
Let's be real though, the bosses in classic are literal loot pinatas. Everyone in org is decked in tier gear cause all you have to do is show up and shit falls over and you get shiny purps. At least pvp gear has an actual barrier to acquiring it, even if the barrier is commitment based and not skilled based
---
My guild doesn't have to gear paladins, not until TBC at least :)
---
For the first week or two at least. Once ranks start to kick it, the lvl 60s that have ranks will be worth more honor per kill.
---
I thought he was kicked out but does seem to be more a suspension since the contract at the time of this post hasnt been terminated and is "being investigated".
---
\- Questie is an absolute absolute must!
---
\- Vendor Price is great to know what quest reward to pick as well as knowing what to trash when your bags are full
---
\- AtlasLoot is nice to know what gear drops in dungeons.
---
\- Puggle is great for collecting all the LFG posts in public channels so you can more easily find dungeon groups.
---
Those are the ones I'm using currently.
---
I’m surprised you have not been doing that lol... I’m horde on skeram, a server we have the huge numbers advantage. And our guild has been rolling out of kargath/dustwallow as one pack for the last month. Got to remember though when you approach closer to the mountain to slow down slightly for the broke boys in your guild lol.
---
his contract was terminated, not suspended.
---
https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr2hut
---
Taking loot is scummy but it isn't cheating, and most people will never know or care that he did it.
---
Idk, getting rid of that stupid tree is probably the only good part of the xpac
---
It's dropped for my guild like 4 times. That's like half the time for us lol.
---
Can comfortably do it under 4 days.
---
Like all the rest. Unzip and add
---
NUMEROUS PEOPLE CARE LOOOOOL. Can we give it a rest with the I dont care this and i dont care that. If you dont care, newsflash: you dont have to read these assinine posts.
---
I mean they can be both. You can be an asshole irl but also play it up for your stream.
---
He's also the guy that could barely beat Xaryu in a duel while Xaryu had NO GEAR AND WEAPONS EQUIPPED. So get the fuck off your high horse, you're still gonna lose to all good mages in pvp with or without that staff.
---
Yeah, the primary purpose of this post was to highlight your first point.
---
Ah yes, this is why when they added loading tips "You can eat AND drink" was the most common to appear :p
---
Sarcasm tag is basically required on the internet. There is no tone-of-voice like there is IRL, there is no context for you as an individual like there is IRL.
---
It can be fun to be  part of a super casual group who doesn't get all DKP or loot council.  You won't progress as far as the 'serious' groups, but it's casual and fun.
---
It can also be fun to be part of a really serious group who gears up the key players and top performers first, and is all about progress.  
---
The key is to find a group who is as serious or casual as you want to be.  
---
just my humble opinion.
---
On top barely being an upgrade, it also means you can’t use any offhand like all your warlock stones, medicine pouch, Skull of impending doom etc
---
Like others said, get questie and don't feel obligated to run around the world to finish a quest.  Sometimes it's not worth it.  Questie will help you find quests and plan a "route" to do them all at once.   You can still read quests also.
---
Korea’s nasty. I have pics.   That’s a fact.
---
Is https://www.wowhead.com/spell=13890/minor-speed#comments in the game yet?
---
Cone of cold is so far superior to blizzard for aoe I have no idea why anyone goes imp blizz anymore. Waste of three very valuable talent points imo
---
&gt;Having a 26% drop rate isn't particularly rare
---
Medium Rare?
---
I can't name off a "ton", but I can list a few off the top of my head:
---
* That annoying "you cannot loot this corpse" bug in group play was fixed the first week or so
---
* The exploit where you could respawn instance/raid bosses with phasing
---
* Fixed the amount of xp you get in raids in dungeons
---
* Added a cooldown to phasing to stop exploiting
---
* Fixed demoralizing shout generating too much AOE threat
---
* Fixed Onyxia's fireballs resetting the threat of the lowest GUID person in range instead of the primary fireball target
---
* Increased the aggro range on guards in neutral cities
---
* Fixed dire maul tribute buffs stacking
---
* Fixed enchants counting towards the helpful aura limit
---
There's probably more too, that's just what I can remember.
---
Lol at first I thought he was memeing. It seems like he's serious though. Is he?
---
First to 60 in classic is still an insane achievement and people will remember
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ExquisiteBrainyCheetahDAESuppy
---
Word for word. Dude literally wrote his own copypasta.
---
Patch 1.10 introduced quest chains that allowed you to upgrade your classes dungeon set to a better set. In this case Shadowcraft can be upgraded to Darkmantle. The 4pc set bonus is pretty good.

---
We are the opposite, 3 rings and no rag 2hers yet :(
---
Just need your healers to be geared, also world buffs and consumables help. Our tanks are also almost epicd out so I'm sure that's a big part.
---
Kind of i just don’t know the most effective routes. I don’t understand where to go
---
Awesome, 
---
Didn´t manage to reach 60 in time for phase 2 (lvl 53), but I hope I will have some fun pvping nonetheless. I´m rocking a Prot paladin too.
---
Can I know what weapon you use \u\simonsolheim ?
---
Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.
---
God, yeah, you're the best player and know everything because your Excel file points out everything and everything is so known, you're so awesome! We got it. You're a fun person to be around.
---
Can you sell Deathcharger or is it soulbound?
---
We don't do world buffs. For us there is no reason to. We cleared MC our first time in there. But our raid night is Sunday which has been pretty calm, but we are pretty outnumbered on Fairbanks by the Horde, so we are going to start rolling in squads everywhere.
---
I'm pissed about keyring and Blizz laziness, but off the top of my head:
---
Raid group exp got fixed
---
BRD torch room mobs gave exp got fixed
---
The enchants hidden aura bug fixed
---
Onyxia fireball stacking hotfixed
---
Gnomish cloaking device dropping combat fixed
---
Hunters received class mechanic fixes
---
Dire maul buffs stacking hotfixed within hours
---
Shazzrahs Counterspell got fixed this week

Why would it? Farming them isn't uncommon without world bosses, they are readily available on my server for around 300g

I bought a twig for 30g around then and do not regret it.  That said, it was a great price and it’s going for a lot more on the server.
---
You'll be fine. Blizzard doesn't just look at ips.
---
No but I remember! Everyone else is wrong!
---
You don't actually say "LFM for BRD only those who can't equip or already have HoJ", you just say LFM DPS BRD and ignore classes who message you who could use HOJ.
---
I feel like that name is pretty easy to overlook just because "labia" isn't super common, and without that context it just looks like a fantasy name.

They can summon people to replace the rage-quitting mages.

Thank you

&gt;\~26% is pretty good. The fact that you've seen it drop once in 3 runs means that you're already above average.

Math disagrees with your assessment.  Roughly 58% you see one in 3 runs yo.

Who cares if playing game X breaks the ToS of another game that you aren't even playing? What kind of argument is that?
---
I would rather not have to wait longer for someone to have to fly around a bunch extra because their hearth is down. I would rather Blizzard just put the keyring in and make the problem completely moot.

This is gold for me, so Regrowth 5 for raid heal and 9 for MT? filling with HT3/4?

In Blackrock Mountain, at the top of the chain you usually take to get to BRD, you go through a hole in the wall and jump onto ledge with a handrail around it. The entrance is right there.
---
nobody cares
---
You may get locked and have to enter authenticator (this happens to me, I travel a bit for work). 
---
Should be fine as long as you contact Blizz if you get the You have been Banned for violation of ToS. 
---
Had this happen to my farm toon account and after talking to the CS person, I was unlocked and g2g. 
---
To be fair, I logged in at Seattle, then 16 hrs later Hong Kong, then 8 hr later Guam.....  so I hold no ill for them locking me out 🤣
---
and people say they don't like personal loot...
---
Imagine going BRM, instead of Hillsbrad TM vs SS like a true Classic lad.
---
Really? There's a Make Azeroth Great AND Make Azeroth Great Again guild on my server lol
---
better than the PUG group where the streamer ninjas it, ironically.
---
eh, you can name your in-game char after whatever you want really because copyright law and public figure rights arent going to overlap there
---
no one looks at an in-game name and things it means an endorsement, as anyone can pick any name
---
and as for copyright it just doesnt cover names at, as they are much different than trademarks
---
copyrights generally refer to the right of a person who created a tangible work to make duplicates or derivative works of it. Using a name in no possible situation will represent an original work fixed to a tangible medium encroaching upon another.
---
Lots of people DO care.
---
This is a game. People play for multiple reasons (relaxation, trying to beat their own record, etc.) When somebody comes in and steals the reward that you have been working towards, it makes you feel certain ways. did actions like these go unpunished, and there is no sense of justice in the activity, then people begin abandoning it.
---
If you want to look at it from a more pragmatic point of view, this was somebody who is signed to a professional sporting team, who behaved in ways unbecoming a member of said team, and lost their 5 figure a year job.
---
Driving down the road, Jokerd hits 120 MPH in his ford fiesta. The blue lights behind him give chase. After hours of high speed driving, he is finally arrested. During the initial court hearings, he decides to represent himself in court.
---
On the first day, he gives the same speech. The prosecution is unable to make any argument against it. After all, how could they. They are just lowly noobs that never made it out of the barrens, forever searching for mankrik's wife. The jury comes back, after only an hour of deliberation and claims that Jokerd is now the president of earth, because he was the first person to hit level 60 in a rerelease of a 15+ year old game. Clearly, there is no one better.
---
Unless I'm blind I only saw one level 60 in the video who wasn't either afk or just trying to ignore you, or was 60% dead when you jumped them.
---
But it was mostly 'pwning' that same 57 badly geared rogue or 2v1'ing that rogue.
---
I got pretty much the same response when I submitted a ticket for a bug that occured preventing the artisan cooking quest from giving me artisan cooking. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/LLE9Eej
---
Thanks. Yes I think I’ve landed on this decision. I was only told it ruins the immersion, but as you say, I can still read the quest texts (many of which are pretty good lore and story wise).
---
Thank you, I was trying to figure out what all this talk of name changes and leveling was about.
---
He doesn’t even need to invest at this point. He’s making over 150k a month.
---
Yes and you get that limit very fast as a maintank. Even the stance is a hidden buff. Head and legs (enchants that you apply from an item take a buff slot)
---
????? It breaks the same tos. When you make your account you sign not to steal their property.
---
One of the top reasons I avoided Streamer servers. A large chuck of the population worship on the altar of those guys and will tolerate and empower them beyond what would be acceptable.
---
One of those exemples that i can´t understand how popular the guy has become is Asmon. The guy acts like an ass half the time, having a gigantic guild sucking on his bullshit and sending him large chunks of gold and items just to try to get on his good graces, when in reality if he wasnt a popular streamer people would block him if he tried to pull 1% of his crap.
---
I never understood those people either.

Fine compare it to stealing since that's what it is. Should thieves get punished?
---
This comment aged well HAHAHAHA
---
Pretty good! For the most part, people are behaving civilly at holding each other accountable.
---
Yeah only scrubs fail the benediction quest.
---
What preparation? They can’t prepare lol. They’ve been asking for people to transfer and people aren’t.
---
They warned about this on release and no body listened. Also a lot of people that stopped playing as much are playing again with the release of pvp being so soon.
---
You can do DM E pretty easily around 53+. DM N can do done below 60, though it becomes harder only due to needing to CC more and pull more packs. You should still be able to provide some sort of CC or DPS in DM N. DM W is, IMO the hardest of the three and, while you may still be able to DPS in there, you may want to wait until youre 55-58. I only say this because a sub-60 group, with no real dungeon gear, has a good chance of getting shredded by the arcane anoms and ghost packs. Again, not impossible, especially with CC, but definitely harder.
---
I have geared to my pre raid bis using the wrong channel. I thought it was dead on my server. Fuck me.
---
There’s no real downside to getting them, takes about 20-25 minutes to do all together. You are right it’s not that needed atm, but good to get in the habit since it will be a requirement come BWL.
---
Or a stroke...
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
this reads like an intern trying to talk like his boss. None of this shit applies or makes sense when you're actually doing it.
---
We were beating the ally premades most of the time in ab, so the ally decided to make a super premade with all their top rankers. We ended up losing by 20 resources, but it was such an epic back and forth i still remember it fondly.
---
Shoutout to the kelthuzad retail vanilla pvp scene
---
I do appreciate how fast and decisive they were but I get the feeling they may have been happy to get out of this contract. They bought on this guy when he was anomalously high and his value is nil now.
---
&gt;Some things will drop every week, some you will never ever see.
---
it's fun to point out that while the chance is very small, there is a non-zero chance the coin will indeed land on tails EVERY single time from now till the end of time.
---
Eventually you will have to start caring about stam and int
---
If anyone can't afford to wait, it's this loser. He'll get 150+ hrs of use out of this item before even having a CHANCE at a Mageblade drop, whereas a normal person might get 10-20hrs of use before next week's raid
---
It is a good guide tho, and he did put a lot of work into it, like a LOT, i know that its not really worth the money still but it is not as bad as it seems at first
---
Imo leveling in spellcleave groups is the most fun I ever had on my 60 mage.
---
Didn't he wear a diaper and shit himself during leveling to 60.
---
Imagine watching streamers in the first place lol
---
bruh
---
So a irl warlock. Never go Oom?
---
What? He signed like 2 weeks ago
---
"I am world first level 60 in classic wow!!!"
---
1. Imagine thinking people care about "world first" in a re-release of a 15 year old game, which you abused layering mechanics to achieve anyway
---
2. Now everyone is going to know you as "that guy that ninja'd MC loot".
---
If you are on a pvp server i suggest SM Ruin.  cant get off big casts in skermishes usually so just Death Coil into a fear chain while they are dotted up.  Nothing funnier than a warrior trying to gank you.  Sac your VW, dot them up while they cant get any rage with your shield and when their Fear ability goes on CD fear the shit outta them and Searing Pain all over them....
---
Forcing someone to equip just proves they won't auction the item.  Even the best items in the game only vendor for a couple gold, and anyone willing to ruin their reputation for a pittance had way more problems than abusing a need&gt;greed system,  lol.
---
It’s kinda funny cause the staff actually sucks in comparison to Mageblade or weapons in BWL.
---
Odds are we clear BWL pretty fast without them too. Most of us are ex mythic raiders and this content is pretty laughable in terms of complexity. Still more fun than retail in general though. Much more fun.
---
People act as if you can't criticize a company while also recognizing they've done something good at the same time lol
---
"Care to name a 'ton' of bugs that have been fixed?"
---
"Here's a list of bugs that have been fixed"
---
*silence*
---
Classic.
---
Or just that the world first 60 influenced a lot of ppl and they wanted to play a mage lol
---
I dunno what gorilla warfare is. This is obviously bullshit because it’s guerrilla warfare. You would think someone trained in it would know that.
---
Revolving loot council is the best way to go. So many items left to rot for dkp.
---
And in league of legends, when you die you respawns at full health and mana at the store to buy better gear.
---
Now saying that wow is a pvp game, but higher consequences for death =/= "a pvp game"
---
Depends what you are doing.
---
If you are dungeon leveling and stay with the same group of players you can easily hit lv60 in 4 days. But getting that group and having the same gaming schedule is near impossible(but it is possible, for example that's how some APES leveled their alts).
---
If you are playing a hunter you can quest/grind and hit 60 in 4 days played fairly consistently if you are following a good guide and know what you are doing.
---
But in general, without lots of practice in leveling, a good guide, you aren't going to level that fast.
---
For someone who's new to leveling and using a guide, I'd say something like 5½-6 days played is a lot more realistic.
---
^^^^ And this is what an actual douche looks like.
---
So far this group suits me so I am good. If things get to a point where it's more like a job than  game i'll likely quit and move on to something else. I play for fun and relaxation, I am not interested in drama or bullshit and so far this clan doesn't have any of that. I also don't want to be at a point where I am pissed off at someone over something like a piece of gear they won or got over me. If I get to that point I will uninstall the game as that is not a game I want to keep playing if I get pissed off at someone over digital items.
---
This case is obviously ridiculous, but I dont get it why this sub is so mad about people reserving items.
---
I mean reasonable in terms of time estimation, but absolutely not to do it! :D
---
If you count bosses, it’s the biggest dungeon of classic in front of BRS (U + L)
---
Crap
---
Ah, definitely lol. I see what you’re saying now.
---
Absolutely not, layering was a such a massive advantage for him, it doesn't compare to just being able to buy some better gear
---
He sounds like someone who's read what acting tough sounds like but has never actually tried it before.
---
It literally wasn't. PvP was an afterthought. The honor system wasn't added until ~5 months in, and battlegrounds were not added until nearly a year in.
---
PvP was never that much of a focus in vanilla, and most of the PvP systems we have were scraped together after the game launched.
---
Yr hasty answer because im at work and cant think xd
---
AHAHAHAHAHA
---
Reputation has decreased. Ironic, eh?
---
Plenty of core gameplay bugs like FD/vanish not dropping combat and rogues generating the wrong amount of energy on their ticks are still live
---
So for me it was 4-7 cast per boss fight with rank 9 regrowths batched with rank 10 rejuv. Then HT rank 4 while the hots are hitting. I throw max rank rejuvs all over to the people who need it. I also keep out a rank 6 regrowth for mana saving purposes
---
Sir, this is a Wendy's
---
And now method has terminated his contract, gg’s
---
For example. If you are targeting a tank and want to cast frostbolt on it's target you can do this:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [target=targettarget] Frostbolt
---
This would allow you to remain targeting a tank and just cast spells on their target.
---
Or if you are a healer and want to cast heal on a target of an enemy you can use this:
---
    /cast [target=targettarget] Flash of Light
---
Check out redlettermedia on youtube.  Some quality movie reviews (their star wars reviews are legendary).
---
You forgot “LF tank”
---
&gt;tank
---
You can tank as (almost) any build, you just have to accept certain trade-offs.  As Arms, you'll notice a quality of life that isn't available to a Prot Warrior, I.E.  you can at least defend yourself to some extent in PvP, or farming mobs at a decent rate.  As Prot, you'll have an easier time when it comes to sloppy dungeon groups that insist on pulling for you, or straight up crit-AoEing before you've even established any aggro.  But if you get jumped by a caster outside of Blackrock Mountain, you'll have to accept that it's an auto-corpse walk.
---
what unit frames are you using?
---
To me, you are just another ~~Goblin~~ Mage. - ~~Goblin~~ Mage Slayer
---
probably uldaman
---
You think anyone is going to watch a video that opens like that?
---
How is it greed? You realize the entire point of reserving is to not get other people who need the same item in your group?
---
i want to see his tinder profile so badly now
---
So he’s been in Method for like.. two weeks?
---
He tried to solicit nude photos from underage girls....
---
....
---
unreal.
---
Oh no, not that guy please.
---
I remember when Hearthstone expansions released, he was foaming from his mouth to be the first who beats it on hard mode. Many streamers competed for fun, and the general consensus was, that despite the mode isn't progressive (you can pick any of the bosses without beating the ones before it), beating heroic is actually completing every level. This "rule" followed for every expansion. 99% of the community agreed on this. 
---
The 1% being Athene and his ballickers.
---
There were 1 expansion where Amaz finished every boss before he finished any, that's how hard he failed. He just started whining and said "he didn't care, he went easy etc.". Expansion after it he just did the last one on heroic and spammed Twitter, Reddit, and asked his viewers to raid other streamer chats, spamming that he is the world first.
---
Is that sack of turd doing Classic? Good thing I avoid the twitch section since I have no liked streamers who do WoW...
---
AQ feels wrong, way too late but I definitely remember seeing the old tier pieces and I started playing a couple of weeks before ZG was released. Probably just remembering it wrong, it was a long time ago.
---
Why? You get a lot higher chance to miss with melee attacks with 2x1H compared to 1x2H. At least for it makes a difference, but I melee-weave and use a lot of Raptor Strikes and Wing Clips, so..
---
Why aren't PvP servers tagged as Normal, and PvE servers tagged as PvE then?
---
HOW ARE YOU BIRD?!
---
He looks pretty serious while saying it. I mean there is a difference between what Asmongold does (ninja looting with a sarcastic tone to make it look less serious, knowing that he’s still gonna be on Twitch’s top 5) and what this guy did. This guy was being a massive dick and an entitled prick for being the first 60 (an accomplishment that imo doesn’t show your skill at the game, just that you have no life).
---
I had a funny one last week, where someone "invited" me to a ubrs run because I had the skinning skill for the Beast/ Rends drake and was told "You will be skinning the 61+ mobs for us and giving us all the skin"
---
Like oh wow, how kind of you
---
Are you still enjoying the game?
---
Whoa but then again LOL at your contract loss Mr. Nobody
---
opportunity cost. he was a nobody before this, method could have given him a career. he blew it.
---
Thanks! 
---
That's pretty much what I've been doing, so I guess I'll keep doing that. Last night I did RFK and BFD just to get the quests done, and then solo'd ghamoo-ra until I got her chest (mine was bad, probably took about 40 mins for several tries all told). 
---
I guess I will continue doing that!
---
-Verbatim what he fucking said
---
Are you my husband?! I swear these are his exact words 😆 hes a pally tank/heal and I'm a frost mage. We've been running dungeons I need since he seems to be lucky on the rolls for his gear.
---
Our guild farmed out eyes for all of our priests, and have so far sold abour 4 of the extras we have... I doubt we are going to be going up in price with Kazzak 
---
That said though this is Azuresong which is full at peak times... not over capacity like other servers.
---
Nah, gunna let my lawyer MT that
---
It's BOP yeah
---
So clearly you don't understand what his point was
---
Two opposing factions fighting against each other and for finite resources. It's literally a pvp game.
---
Finally some sense is spoken. 
---
I was pretty into PUBG but I never watched streamers. I guess some guy who wears sunglasses (doc?) “chested on his wife” and “quit streaming” but then suddenly “made a triumphant return” and nobody would shut up about it. 
---
I’m all for kayfabe sometimes but I just can’t do it for steamers.
---
as others mentioned... if people are farming DM they will use specific routes and strats. that only works if shit doesn't aggro, and the whole place will aggro with a lvl 53. otherwise it doesn't really matter, you can 4 man it almost as fast as 5 man.
---
Fixed this week apparently!
---
I mean, int is generally at least 1:1 as good as +Healing. A lot of people don't understand that. The main confusion though is that 1.75 int to Healing is actually about equal because +Healing on gear is generally 1.75x or more than int allocations.
---
Also, all of these calculations were under the context of my own stats and play style (i.e. no flasks/consumables). The intention was for people to plug in their own values to find out their weights for themselves.
---
So excited to use this
---
Umm. Simpsons*
---
Very humble
---
I think people underestimate how much is 500 to 1000 viewers. Imagine doing a live show everyday of the week and every day there is 500 people watching you, that would be a sucessful event even for a tv actor or whatever
---
You're gonna get people saying "it's just a game, bro" but yeah I think it's more of a philosophy on life. Do it for yourself, not for outside validation.
---
i got stuck there and had to kill myself with unstuck option
---
What is ninja looting
---
"Spoke to his Manager"

You mean they spoke with his mommy. No more WoW for you!

Hi, Jenga here, ~50 UD rogue on Sulfuras
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Me and Checkers the priest tried to quest in the Cove on Sunday night and got absolutely wrecked by the large group of Alliance there, many 55+, so much we had to bail
---
So when we went back Monday night, we did not show mercy.
---
If you'd like to share your character name, we'd be happy to kill you on sight.
---
Thanks again
---
I mean if everyone in the party agrees to it then what is the issue? World chat very often ridicules tanks on my server for reserving all orbs in strat live (I do the very same). Yet every single time, I still manage to fill my groups. As do the other warriors. So long as everyone agrees to the conditions and reservations, no matter what they are, really not a lot of exploiting going on
---
;)
---
Yeah I’m sure method doesn’t want all that popularity. I bet he “apologizes” (bonus if it’s a shitty fake apology first for maximum drama) and after a while, everything is back to normal.
---
Gotcha. If you're having fun just keep doing you. There's no reason to rush to 60 if you enjoy the game how you're playing it. 
---
If you want to go quicker, at least get questie addon if you don't have it. It shows on your map where quest givers are, so you can see which zone had quests. It also shows the suggested level for you to do the quests, the location of objectives, and what you need to kill for quests when you click on mobs.
---
Not to mention the fact that thanks to this he probably lost the only form of income he's ever had in his life.  Poor woman was like finally my son is going to get his shit together and move out...
---
"career"
---
I've been running a ret reckoning build for pvp after being prot throughout the grind to 60. Never ventured into the holy tree outside of consecrate but find they holy reckoning idea to be intriguing. What build do you use and how do you decide on gear/stat priority?
---
Gods work
---
Hes a streamer as well he could easily advertise the run as "this is a shameless run I'm taking every piece I can use".
---
As long as everyone who joined up knew that ahead of time there would be no issue and he would of still gotten the Staff of Dominance.
---
Idiot
---
I thought this was just a copypasta. I guess we should make it one.
---
Gonna need to clear a lot of extra because of the bigger aggro range though. And expect a lot of resists.
---
Enchanting is much easier to gather than Blacksmithing formulas. It's not hard to get some decent formulas in and make a few gold every few minutes. Though it's boring as fuck to sit in AH to do it.
---
Athene knew he was trolling this guy is legit serious is the difference
---
&gt;Imagine completely destroying your reputation for a piece of MC loot  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;LOL
---
It's not even BiS!
---
You can't, he likely got the message "there is no player by that name" or w/e and figured out his mistake then extrapolated his story for this post to make it sound funnier.
---
It demonstrates they are prepared, and have put in the effort to do the best they can as opposed to showing up wearing level 30 gear that's not got proper stats or as much plus heal / damage as they can get. 
---
I got one prepare and have zero interest in carrying people who won't at least try to do the same. 
---
Saying it's solely based on a random internet list very short sighted imo.
---
I guess I'll give it a couple of tries,  in that case, at least. 
---
I'll think about the healing gear. I've mostly been a healer in the past, but I had a better connection. It wouldn't hurt to try, anyway.
---
Do you know what the word literally means? Cone of cold's crit chance is *literally* based off level, talents, and gear (spell crit and intellect). So yes, 1.5% increased crit from intellect *literally* increases the frequency of critical strikes.
---
Source on this?  The paladin PvP sets are itemized very differently.  It would be huge to have both.
---
Yeah bots are fairly common in low foot traffic area's.
---
Middle of bumfuck nowhere Tanaris, Anywhere not near the MC rep elemental in Ashzara and a few others are 'common' places to find these fools
---
I'm not your guy, friend
---
Probably none. He probably thinks it wasn't his fault.
---
I would guarantee he’s making a comfortable amount streaming a video game, he really doesn’t care lol. He openly trolled Method during the days after launch...
---
I started vanilla after phase 2 was out so this shot ain’t new. It is what it is.
---
&gt; which gets replaced by MC loot from the same boss
---
Get fucked, kid. Way to lose your only opportunity at the big times.
---
hey! im a mage on my alt and i dont ninja i just have a boosted 120 so i can teleport and create portals everywhere lol
---
You are what you pretend to be
---
Locks are also super common
---
My guild has 2 resto druids and one Bear. They all are sooooo geared. It’s just how it is sometimes!
---
I think I totally misread your comment tbh, my bad
---
I thought you meant most guilds should make 5 man rogue/warr groups without *any* shaman and I couldn't wrap my mind around that. I definitely agree with your last comment!
---
Why did you keep /w-ing him if you'd get the automated message "no player with that name exists" or w/e it says when you /w something wrong?

Very little of anything else dropping for us....

Week 8 of clears.

This is spot on.

My dungeon gear is mainly pre-bis, with only archmage robe as my epic. The gear may be what is holding you back, all frost/spell power damage for PVE. (less than 5k mana with my pve gear since i push for spell power here). I normally do PUG groups for MC as i cant commit to a time for a guild raid, but am always one of the top 3-5 "dps" and a top 8-10 "damage". I dont use consumables in raids lol, im a shmuck. 
---
I have mainly greens and other high int pieces for my AOE gear. What ever gets me the most int, i use. 2.9K health and 6.3k mana, spell power is nothing compared to int for AOE. Getting off one extra CoC or AE is massive. I do ZF zombies in 3 pulls and maybe use a mana gem once per run. Only time I use a consumable/mana potion for zombies is after i use a mana gem and have a double resist on my nova. (You can normally use an ice barrier if one zombie resists and get off two blizzard channels without interruption)
---
Eh, I've had middling success in pugs. Like dealing with toddlers it's all about expectation management. You don't say "We're going to do LoS pulls for safety" because they'll go "wah! wah! that's slow!". Instead you ask "Hey, up for aoe-ing down these packs?", Dps inevitably cheers, "Great! I'll pull them around this corner to clump them up and you go ham!". Profit!
---
tbf that is a pretty fking good amount of viewers. Not exactly "struggling." You can make a good living with that amount of viewers
---
Holy fuck that's hilarious. The ego. About lvl 60 in classic wow. Just... Loooooool

Waiting in q for 3 hours.
---
:) things are goin well
---
Pick 1
---
I started a little before the honor system and I still remember being able to find a big fight in town somewhere pretty regular. Hell, people would line up to dual each other outside of IF and SW. PvP was a much bigger thing than it's been in classic so far.
---
&gt; What's the point of being geared if you're not world's first anything?
---
that’s a terrible philosophy lol
---
What the f**k, dude, did you seriously just compare ninja looting in a video game to murder? :D This is the lowest of the low.
---
Reserving loot is the cost of me not gearing guildies  or messing with my Twink.
---
Would you rather wait on a “tank” or take one with raid gear, 55 damage of return damage (smooth AoE pulls) and all enchanted good gear. 
---
I either do first orb in Strat live or all unneeded greens/blues. Depending on the run I’ll make 20g off of the run. That’s not a crazy amount of gold
---
If you think repeatedly griefing people who have no ability to fight back is 'fun' then I think you're a bit pathetic.  It's like people who kick their dog after a shitty day at work.
---
I will 100% judge that 'fun' and I don't think you have a defense other than "it's my right to be a twat".  Of course it's your right, just as it's your right to tell a stranger they're ugly.
---
You're still a dumbshit with weird preferences.
---
shazzrah is great
---
Rod is better than any MH+Aq for now, though keep Aquamentis around in case you get sorcerous dagger or mageblade in MC.  You don't say what pants you have, but you'll probably want those next if you don't already have Spiritshroud, and Sublime bracers from DM:N (Moldar and Slip'kik).
---
Toxic is another word for asshole, and I can assure you, that assholes exist, in every culture, society, group of people you can find. And if you don't think assholes exist, you're probably the asshole.

Hes not. https://clips.twitch.tv/ExquisiteBrainyCheetahDAESuppy

You'd be surprised how little PvP occurs where they are currently farmed, it's not a safe place for wpvp

The make Azeroth great was an auto name change.
---
Old rule was 65% of the mob HP to get full exp. 
---
not sure if this still holds true.
---
lol
---
Null pointers aren’t interesting from a technical perspective.
---
1. Your damaging your parties ability to form quickly be restricting who would have access.  At the get go your already slowing progress for others in your group, which is disrespectful to them.
---
2. Next your limiting the pool of loot for others who also need items besides that, despite the fact they to need put in equal effort to get them in the same group as the reservee.
---
3. Your pulling players from the pool wanting to do the dungeon and trying them up in longer group formation times + run length, that would otherwise benefit groups that don't contain selfish douchebags 
---
4. Your literally putting a beacon out there that says, I refuse to accept the possibility I come in second place and would rather swap the loot to master looter for the bosses I want and likely would ninja loot other expensive BoE items if they fell under the Master Looter timeframe...  I assure you, no one trusts master looter in 5 man's
---
Id move hunters to the mage bracket and lock to the easy or mage bracket
---
What caster DPS? 
---
Warlocks have Life Tap, basically infinite runes, and Mages hava gems which put the runes on CD anyway.
---
So yes, it is an unwritten rule. Leave it to the healer.
---
I didn't realize until level 30 that warlock curses can be put on multiple targets.  I misunderstood the spell description and thought I could only have a single curse in total at a time
---
None of the above except 1 toep. Lots of felheart robes and earthfury robes. Literally i think every core lock/shammy raid member has them now. Also that one gun, even had a hunter gquit because a pug won it our first week when we didnt have a full roster.
---
Legendarylea BiS wow streamer

"Reckoning Bomb Ready!"
---
It won’t go away after a few weeks lol. It will be around for 3 months. People will be ranking, especially on populated servers.
---
did his manager drop him?
---
Moved from Dreadmist to Golemagg a week ago to play with friends and they did warn me about the queues, not a great feeling but hey ho. 
---
P.S: My level 23 priests body is ready to be 1 shot by bored 60's out in the world now.
---
I've seen rogues spamming for tanks for arena/anger runs with them trying to reserve HOJ. Oh that's so kind, you're going to let me roll on the SGC that has less than a 1% chance of actually dropping where i'll likely be the only person in the party that can wear it anyway? Yeah no thanks.
---
OK patientbearr
---
So, based on your numbers:  
---
at $20 per 100g in a "few months" you could bot out $80.  If a "few" is say... 3 ... then 3 x $15/month = $45, and $80-$45 = $35.  
---
So after a few months of botting you can net $35.  Totally not worth it, or am I missing something?
---
How much does the Devilsaur set sell for on your server? Is it a must have for a (gnome) fury warrior? Should I farm it (currently min/eng) or just buy it? Thanks in advance!
---
How are so many people taking this seriously lmao
---
Yeah, a brake on the investment can be a good thing from your s.o. Moderation is the key to good things. So many people you read about on this reddit go balls to the walls all-in or quit entirely. I don't get it.
---
He is not the best. He’s insanely bad. Yeah he knows how to powerlevel, but he’s a dog shit player 😂
---
Maybe local and live, but when the entire internet is your potential audience 500-1000 is such a small group.  I guess people who tend to watch streams are lonely and invested and feel the streamer is their friend so they give more than a traditional audience.  Even so when you compare that to TV audiences it just seems like nothing.
---
Okay so we’re in the same boat then! Went for my epic mount before arch mage but other than that I have quite a bit of spell power gear. 
---
I’m looking at your spec and liking it much more as it’s going to make ZF farming much easier.
---
This was super helpful man, really appreciate the responses
---
Not my fault you don't have any reading comprehension
---
Yeah, they lost my suspension of disbelief with the "I think it was the raid leader who ended up putting a baby in her." line.
---
Imagine you're just some nolife private server euro wow player who never works or goes outside. Suddenly all of your nolifing pays off and you get 350k viewers, then you join method for money and get a couple of thousand viewers every stream, followed by the subs.
---
So you start to think "Hey, you know what, I am better than everyone else and I can do whatever the fuck I want." and then you decide to ninja [MC loot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1Dpi3em5msI/maxresdefault.jpg)

All unneeded blues is less gold than a righteous orb though
---
Whitemane has 2 hour ques at west coast 6:30 PM
---
As arms or 2h fury? I'm respecing today and I still haven't decided if I want to go arms or fury. Currently just have the sword from Dire Maul, but I will have priority on 2h's and Sulfuras if I decide I want to farm it.
---
There are people trying to outlaw being an asshole, then. There have always been tools in place to deal with people like that, such as ignore. Having any other form of punishment means that we're headed for an Orwellian nightmare.
---
The real fuckin crime here is giving any attention and views to all these streamers literally milking y’all for free money, remaking videos and streaming raids/strategies that we’ve already seen for the past 14 years. 
---
Glad the dude lost his sponsorship and all that, but the only reason these guys are doing this stuff is to fabricate drama for views..
---
Think cadav belt is only slightly less damage than Cloud but also has the Stam so I think it's better. The bracers are better than even nightslayers I think.
---
That being said SC 6p 2pc Tier 2 is what I'm running with Krol Blade and mirah.
---
Would honestly say try and get all of SC as the 6pc is really good imo. Been doing really well in my raids log.
---
Yep. This is why I'll never get married again. That way when I get an ultimatum, I can just calmly point to the door and get back to what I was doing.
---
That said, there's a big difference between an ultimatum and her expressing a desire to spend more time with him. I wouldn't get angry, or do anything rash for that. I would, however, analyze my life and make my own decision. I wonder how she'd handle it if he just said no.
---
wow i didnt know that, what does it do?
---
That's what I thought too! I'm honestly surprised (in a good way) that he got this much backlash. I was expecting the whole "lel he trolled those nerds, he says it like it is" bullshit to be the loudest voice. I fully expect him to double down as the "non-PC streamer" at this point though.
---
Imo the best way ti play is guideless, cause even if you know the quests, the mobs the drops and all that, there is always something to discover if you take your time
---
Yes i would run those, i wouldn't stand outside the instance and waste everyones time. We could kill jed 3 times while people wait for more resets to find rend in your scenario. I'm very happy to help people run dungeons but standing there doing nothing is frustrating.
---
Does he have a citation?
---
If that floats your boat go for it!
---
Almost everyone in entertainment has a manager. It’s not that big of a deal and they have tons of clients.
---
Ok, he's a dick.
---
Dude, same level, same feelin'.
---
They picked him up 2 weeks ago
---
Good for, sure. Easily upgraded and replaced too
---
That aged well.
---
Key Ring phase 5 confirmed? Lmao
---
What did it cost is the meme you’re looking for.
---
I was hoping the GM interactions in the beta would be an indication of things to come. I have never been a huge fan of the game Fortnite but they've shown us the power of in-game events. I played the game with friends from time to time, although I cant recall any particular game I don't think I'll ever forget the Marshmello event. Something similar could be accomplished if a giant Omar appeared and melee'd a trouble maker to death, or something along those lines. Showcase the power! I second this motion.
---
This *may not* result
---
There's a chance they will
---
pvp in wow is a possibility and an afterthough at best, but definitely not the focus.
---
He had his time to shine and he's using it to justify his selfish immature behavior.  Nobody is saying world first 60 or 350k twitch views isn't impressive, we're just saying this guy is a fucking douchebag whose 15 minutes of fame is over.
---
Yeah lol. I played in some 2015-16 and totally rolled need on everything.
---
When do they start doing more damage? I've leveled a mage paladin and priest to 60 and at no point did any rogue hunter or warrior have more damage than whatever mage was in my party, must be a raid thing?
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Test_of_Honor_Contest  
---
&gt;To celebrate the launch of the Honor System, Blizzard issued a Test of Honor Contest. This took place in both WoW USA and Europe from April 25 to May 24, 2005.[1]  
---
&gt;&gt;veryone that participated in player-versus-player combat from the time it was patched into the game until the contest ended on May 24th 2005 had a chance to win prizes; ranging from NVIDIA graphics cards to free WoW gametime. The higher your ranking in the Honor System on May 24th, the better your chance of winning. However, anyone that participated had an opportunity to win something.[2]
---
Ranks in the honor system equated to a number of 'virtual tickets' (each ticket was a chance to win). The higher your rank in the honor system, the more tickets you received.
---
In addition, the player with the most earned Honor points from each faction on every realm during the contest period were awarded a  [Contest Winner's Tabard].  
---
Seems like Phase 2 would be the perfect time to bring this back!
---
Link it
---
No 60 is gonna be camping people under 48 for a while now at least
---
pservers were niche. still a nobody imo. and by "before this" i meant before his world first. which happened before method, true, but i don't think he would have maintained any popularity without them.
---
Gonna be real, swap back to feral. You're not gonna be even close to having the gear necessary to make a moonglow build work, and deep resto is not very good. You can instead go 1/29/21, getting a point in Nature's Grasp in order to root any attackers, and Nature's Swiftness so you can actually still heal. This build means you can heal Ony and MC, be flexible for healing a dungeon or tanking it, and actually still do overworld content. Also you can do the ganking yourself in cat form if you want, a squishy class like a Mage has p much no recourse if you powershift through their roots.
---
It's not something you really need to buy as a gnome, since you should be looking to use Edgemasters Handguards. They are incredible gloves for you, should last until AQ40.
---
As a ret paladin I would like to have judgement of command scale with attack power.
---
&gt; P.S: My level 23 priests body is ready to be 1 shot by bored 60's out in the world now.
---
Now that honor's out most of them are probably picking on 49s, 23s don't give any honor to a 60.  You might get jumped more by 30s though.
---
The way he spoke immediately after he got the world first hit me the wrong way. Its good to see my gut wasn't wrong here. He reeked of arrogance. I feel like someone even slightly with a decent head on their shoulders could have used this fame to monetize themselves decently well. What a joke(er).

Its your bis til well into phase 3, so get it...its probably cheaper to buy mats and get it crafted than to buy it outright.
---
No Madam! But it seems there is a pattern with a tank/mage composition!
---
What a neckbearded little virgin.
---
ok but tbf every single person racing to 60 was "exploiting layering" and I hesitate to call it an exploit because it wasn't against ToS whatsoever. 
---
Guy is a legendary tier douchebag and I'm glad Method kicked him to the curb, but it's still impressive what he was able to do.
---
As will you! I play moomglow nature swiftness myself and when you get the hang of it druids are very mobile and tough even as healers. Its more about surviving the initial blast and get some distance to think and regroup. Especially against rogues and mages. I am also approaching epic mount gold. I found alchemy to be very helpful for goldmaking. As well as dungeon running
---
You're not a real word...
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I leveled top of my layer with a mage, and I've been involved in numerous secret aoe grinds on Mogarine, and I have over 60 confirmed levels. I am trained in inv layer pls and I'm the top ninja in the entire EU servers. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe youroot the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of level exploits across the EU and your loot is being traced right now so you better prepare for the ninja, maggot. The ninja that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your guild. You're fucking ninja’d, kid. I can be any layer , anytime, and I can ninja you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my need rolls. Not only am I extensively trained in aoe grinding, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Twitch viewership and I will use it to its full extent to ninja your miserable loot off the face of the server, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking ninja’d, kiddo.

2 hour levels for 10 levels is still almost a day played. :P

what

That's no fun
---
I found a forors in my DM east farm and sold it to a guild tank for 200g. 
---
It depends if you need that gold now or not. I'm both a warlock and play nonstop, so I don't. For me finding these high ticket items is a cool bonus to my normal farming. I'd rather they be in use than get tons of gold or rot in a bank/ah.
---
I’ve seen Abalone around, I’m usually just feeding trolls in LFG while running/grinding
---
imagine someone wanting to be paid for a ton of work they did &amp; while they have tons of customers very willing to pay. Crazy!!!
---
I really hope he was joking around cuz jesus, if he's not I'd implore him to seek help. That's not a healthy mindset.
---
Yeah, 11 years ago dude would be like 8 years old? I don't know how hold he is and can't be bothered to look it up.
---
he was already struggling like 2 weeks ago is his point
---
Considering the guy lost his job, his partners, his gaming friends, all because he was being an asshole, Id say it is about alot more than just how YOU feel about a comment. I guess reading into it is a little hard for someone who doesnt know what 'Toxicity' means in a gaming community.
---
Thanks, Ill have to check it out
---
lol okay show me one person who’s not salty about getting ganked
---
Trying to save a quarter
---
There’s pathetic and then there’s this.
---
No matching names, I am disappointed.
---
It’s a joke man
---
I have read that the Battle Chicken and the Deathray are must haves for engineers.
---
What about the Goblin stuff - which should I craft?
---
the famous twitch streamer Venruki Venruki
---
He lost his job because his words/actions hurt his brand/sponsors. The major repercussions is actually about reputation and money, not feelings.
---
Except you're wrong, the dude is a prick but you're making me defend him because you're just spreading misinformation. He didn't use layering to level faster, he used it because he was about to get world first and people were trying to gank him. If he made a new account and started a new character he wouldn't even have to worry about that
---
If you’re an orc, you go axes, no discussion needed. +5 wep skill is huge
---
To me a more fair way to help your guildie would be requisition for helping the priest if you really wanted to literally grind the eye. So say + X amount of DKP per week for however number of weeks.
---
Or have a gold donation requisition that could go towards buying the eye.
---
I actually really like Windseeker and I'm horde.  I played on Incendius(level 39), Heartseeker(level 44), and Benediction(level 46 and a 44) and it felt too full and too busy.  Having some peace and slower pace is much more enjoyable.  The people on this server also seem to  be not of the meme, twitch wannabe culture.  Often the people seem to be new or less knowledgeable but that's the true spirit of vanilla wow imo.
---
It can be tough to find groups in the morning but that's been the case on all my other servers too.
---
Found Jokerd's boyfriend
---
he wasn't uncontested though, people were grouping up ganking him
---
It's not so much the speed but the weapon damage itself.
---
If you have 2 items of the same level, the slower of the 2 will have better flat damage which is used to calculate a lot of your abilities.
---
Guy said method wouldnt care, guess what they did LOL, no one wants a douchebag ruining there their rep. Look how much better he made that guild. Youre a joke bud, give up.
---
lol there are streamers out there who make more in a month than i will make in 5 years
---
I haven't been ganked much either, I was one of the first 60s on my server.  I just didn't really ever kill lowbies, because it's stupid, and I think people who do are assholes.
---
It's not really an entitlement thing, it's just an expectation thing.  MMOs tend to attract spergy people who think because the game permits it, they aren't still assholes for doing it.
---
Cringe lord
---
Edited my comment to clarify better. Thanks for nitpicking I don't want to cause confusion!
---
That drops at 25%, and there's a better drop available from the same boss at the same rate
---
Are you kidding me? You just need on all BOEs because they can be sold, regardless of whether or not someone in your group might actually use it? I hope people stop playing with your sorry ass, that's a shit attitude to have.
---
Every 6 seconds as they powershift?
---
Good Morning Azeroth is a great podcast. Lorecraft as well.
---
I remember that day when my server first transcendence shoulders suddenly weren't embarassing. Ppl wouldn't even spend dkp on some t2 in my guild cuz it looked shit.
---
Within honor range, definitely. But I very much doubt we'll get more 60s killing lowbies that are grey to them, they'll be out picking on greens for the HKs.
---
Hell, Twitch streamers probably helped them in the long run because they can point out those losers making so much $$$ from what THEY show lol
---
Read what i wrote again. I said that Ion said perditions blade would be in and guess what it was lol
---
Are you sensitive? Did a few posts hurt you?

"LF 2 Dps and tank, Anger spam, HoJ res." An hour later and they're practically begging people to join.

Ahhh brings back memories when I won a need roll of a couple of other peeps...good times

My bird does glows.

We're down to the D3 level of communication. Pray it doesn't drop any lower.
---
Well. My best experience so far was the darkshire chain that ultimately led to the king giving me a blue ring. I had no idea and I really felt I worked my ass for it. That was gratifying and I had no idea I would even get a decent reward. If questie don’t kill that type of experience I’m down for using it.
---
What level was the character you were tryin to name change?
---
I don't care about Jokerd. All I saw was some guy ninjaing a staff from a PUG. Who gives a sh*t? You're making a big deal about nothing.
---
well, its just a game, not a career.
---
The King of Malta went from anomoly to jokerd back to anomoly in just a few months
---
first off, that wasn't a bug and it wasn't patched. You were able to do that up until the very last moment layers existed.
---
Second, he wasn't layering to get new mobs, he was layering to avoid the groups of people trying to gank him to stop him from hitting world first. That's not something he would even have to worry about on a new anonymous account
---
I don't want to defend this prick, but your stupidity is making me
---
All you need to do now is talk about logic and reason and I've got a bingo.
---
Who cares, the mount is a stupid skeleton horse and most mounts in the game look better. Outside the rarity of owning it what does it matter
---
it's dungeon grinding. what competition are you talking about
---
You can see on i think it's death and taxes or dramas first kill of nef their warrior has the T2 placeholder wrath helm
---
They're mutually exclusive, 58 set was removed as 60 set was added, but the people that earned and bought the 58 pieces before the removal got to keep them.
---
Not worth the money. Especially if you're hit capped (or close), you wont get much benefit from the axe. Go farm out the off hand and be happy until you get a raid drop.
---
Is the etiquette when pugging to need on BOE purple? Someone I was grouped with said it was...
---
Levels between 30-40 all takes 1,5-2,5 hours questing
---
Hope it's just a role/mask of a bad guy he took on for his Twitch personality, he seemed like a really chill dude during/after the 1st LVL 60 run
---
It's literally what Jokerd said in the video this post is about my dude.
---
I am not familiar with any brand or sponsorships. If he was terminated it better be because of a breach of contract and not because of people's feelings.
---
Did the same things when I first started publishing scripts and configs on GitHub. It again gets easier with experience!
---
Reduced glancing blow penalty and only needing 6% hit is massive.
---
The second one for sure.
---
All words are just made up. In your opinion when does a "made up" word become a real word? Because toxic is in the dictionary.
---
Have you met mages?
---
The exploit was never patched though. He didn't do the dungeon exploit, he just hopped layers to get away from people trying to gank him. That was something you were able to do up until the last moment layers existed, it was never patched out. You have no idea what you're fucking talking about
---
Do you understand the ridiculous advantage one has of being literally the only person on the entire server in whatever zone? Wpl for example. There was not a single second spent waiting for a respawn or competing to tag a mob once he broke away from the pack.
---
a complete breakdown of what I did was use max rank regrowth batched with max rank rejuv off the bat. I would watch the main tank go in and start casting early predicting the hit. It’ll
---
Maybe over heal 200 hp at worst and you’ll now have 2 powerful hots on the MT. I’ll then throw rank 4 healing touches on the tank if they’re getting hit hard and use rank 9’regrowth batched with rejuv on other tanks that need it. If a tank isn’t getting hit very hard I’ll use rank 6 regrowth but that’s not very often. Regrowth hot is almost twice as long as rejuv so I’ll pay attention and make sure to throw another rejuv until the regrowth is done then do the same thing over again. So it’s batching those two spells with hots and rank 4 healing touches in between.  I used 4 major mana pots the whole raid and innervated myself.
---
Seems to me hes trying to fill the void of athene and take on his persona
---
I loved watching this one mage in Tarnasis trying to aoe down the pirates at the dock area. I was there for about an hour griding on my warlock killing 2/3 at a time and this mage kept pulling 7+, getting them to ~25% hp and then dying. He killed maybe 2 groups in the entire time I was watching him and died the rest. Meanwhile my slow and steady grinding killed things 100% of the time without any fear of dying except the one time he ran by me, died and I got aggro from siphon life healing.
---
Gadgetzan is often overlooked. Some people diddle around in town tho. I got me a tasty 48 lock last night, jumped over the wall by the surveyor and I just hopped right behind him, had to get some practice to remember whats it’s like to kill lowbies before today
---
Really depends on how much whining people do, or is subscriber numbers start to drop.
---
Whether Blizzard wants to admit or not WPvP is a clusterfucks and team n+1 will always win which on most servers is horde.  
---
If the game becomes as literally unplayable as chicken little claims it will be, then BGs early sound like a good idea.
---
Man I feel bad for some people it sounds like you guys have trash communities.  My server the top guild leaders are very well connected and any bullshit like actual ninjas or disrespect gets spread throughout leadership and quashed immediately.  Reputation matters a ton on my server.  I'm glad.

I feel like they brought him on... just to do this. He troll'd the heck out of them on his grind and made them look like idiots and this attitude he has is not a surprise, he always had this demeanor. Method knew exactly the type of person he was. Honestly, Method were probably just waiting for this opportunity to shame him and make themselves look better. 
---
I.E. - I don't trust Methods intentions here from the start.
---
I refuse to do this quest solo as I keep getting fucked??
---
Definitely not true it was one of the most balanced servers before the census data broke nearly 55/45
---
I'd honestly keep the paw for when you do 5mans.  Much better rage gen and you won't encounter any 63s where weapon skill plays a huge role.
---
In this patch version are fist weapons immune to disarm?  Also maybe another argument for the ol 5 man keep
---
Pretty much
---
Soul link, seduce, orc
---
**How did he exactly cheat when he streamed it all, are you a paid method actor?**
---
Absolute menace.
---
I'm not so sure that Athene was acting considering everything he's done since then.
---
This is coming up in this sub every couple weeks - they were updated long before AQ event launched. Its just not in the patch notes.,
---
hah yeah it sounds like he was shit at aoe grinding. It's actually kind of hard until you get some practice under your belt
---

Ouch. You're very sensitive and quick to lash out.

GYs are usually next to FPs - you kill them (repeatedly) as they try and get away after rezzing.
---
res* from reserved
---
What the fuck did you just say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I leveled to 60 first in classic wow and I’ve been involved in numerous streams and I have over 350k views confirmed.
---
I'd rather be a grunt in a guild that can actually raid than an officer of a dead guild.
---
Soul link with VW, seduce is great too, and orc is nice

The word exists, but the meaning is relatively new. Why not just say that he was an asshole, and leave it at that? The word "toxic" gets thrown around just like the whole "muh racist" mantra, which makes words lose their real meaning and impact.
---
You need 100 int for a single crit % 
---
AT 60
---
For the fun? Helping friends? Maybe quest? I dont know, I just want like to play the game...
---
The only thing this proves is that people that writes "reserved" when they're looking for groups are wasting time. 
---
They can just loot it when it drops.
---
soul link + voidwalker out, dot and dance. works 9/10 for me
---
i dont see your name
---
Frankenstein's monster was misunderstood, you might wanna find a better analogy.
---
Dilate.
---
Only agreed if by fury you mean also having 11 in arms.   Those rage talents are superstar mvp shit in 5mans
---
Let you know when I see the keyring again.
---
Well done man this is awesome
---
I thought int didn't give spellpower til BC. It's just more Mana pool and a tiny amount of spell crit (way smaller ratio than ago gives physical crit).
---
The mageblade plus the spirit of aquamentas quest green from ungoro is way better
---
"No in fact I will not, good luck finding a chump"
---
Imagine having such a big ego that you talk about how amazing you are for being world first but in the Same VOD you don't even show up on like the first 20 in  the meters.... Guys such a joke spent all that time on 60 just to get thrashed on meters in a pug
---
If only there wasn't a debuff limit.
---
A lot of orgs act as bridges between the streamer and sponsors and take a % of the deal.
---
Say, for example, if Method got Joker a deal with Intel to promote its new microprocessor for faster ninja looting, Method would get like 20% of the whole deal.
---
Dungeon and Dragons, pen and paper RPGs, and one big catalyst for it all "Everquest".
---
Everquest was WOW before MMOs were wildly popular.
---
WOW is in many ways an Everquest clone with a huge Blizzard/Warcraft skin.
---
It was also made easier, a bit more casually, and more easily accessible by an average consumer.
---
If you think WOW is time consuming and can be punishing then Everquest was almost sadistic in many ways.
---
WOW took a lot of Everquests best parts and improved them, and took some of it's more unforgiving qualities and made them easier or downright got rid of them.
---
But if course even WOW is not perfectly balanced and hybrids especially were pidgeon holed into one spec because their other talents were not really balanced. Like Paladins not being able to tank or Druids being pure ass at DPS.
---
Plus many of us have jobs and lives now. We can't spend every waking moment researching if someone is a ninja or not. We don't have all day to play, so we'd rather play than research
---
it's not just publicity, it's the whole business side of things. either way, you're probably right. i'm pretty out of touch with streamers in general, since i don't understand why half the top streamers have any viewers at all lol
---
Thought that copy and pasta was just a piss take. As if the clown actually said it.
---
Didn't he only "exploit" layering at the very end when he had 60 guaranteed? And everybody else at the top used layering too so it's not like he had an unfair advantage
---
On the plus side, playing WoW has saved me a SHIT-TON of money by not going out for drinks/dinner/clubs as often as I did before August
---
Reset time is not spawn time in classic
---
[It's an interface options setting.](https://i.imgur.com/iQwsTJf.jpg)
---
Probably loot council. Who needs geared tanks when a rogue can vanish, is probably their flawed reasoning.
---
What a wanker...
---
If you're just learning how to tank it's probably better to stick with 1H + Shield right now to learn the mechanics of holding aggro over a group. 1H + Shield tanking you can pretty much spend the entire time in Def stance, but 2H tanking relies a lot more on stance dancing and macros. 
---
1H Tanking, here's a [good example of Skarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlj0qghpEsc) 1H tanking at low level: 
---
* Sunder Armor and Revenge are your highest threat builders.
---
   * Shield block to get Revenge up
---
* Taunting mobs off healer is priority. Also recommend putting a raid marker over healer to make them easier to spot. 
---
* Pulling: Buy a gun so you can pull mobs from a distance, charging won't always be a viable option.
---
* Pulling: Mark your targets, everything is better when DPS is focusing targets down
---
* About to die: Pop Shield Wall 
---
* About to die: Buy a ton of health pots from the AH and keybind them. 
---
* AOE Pulls: Demo shout is good for grouping mobs up but you will need to tab sunder to hold aggro. The shout is not enough to hold aggro over the group, especially if DPS isn't focusing a target down. 
---
* Avoid AOE dungeon groups if you're not the highest level member, you will 100% have a hard time holding aggro. AOE groups also spend a lot of time drinking in between pulls which means you'll start every pull at 0 or close to 0 rage. 
---
   * My general rule of thumb is to be the highest level member of the group when I tank no matter what and things go a lot smoother. Not required but I've found it a lot easier to hold aggro. 
---
Typical pull rotation for me looks something like:  
---
Pull w/gun or charge -&gt; Bloodrage -&gt; Sunder, tab -&gt; Sunder, tab -&gt; Revenge if it's up otherwise Sunder, tab -&gt; Demo Shout -&gt; Rinse/repeat. Basically try and get a revenge or sunder on every mob on the pull before switching over to other abilities. Taunt anything you lose aggro on. 
---
Situationals:  
---
Shield Block when you start to build more rage, Shield slam on casters, cleave to rage dump
---
2H Tanking:
---
Keep in mind that 2H tanking vs 1H + Shield is not an "either or". It's situational and you should have both on you at all times. There will be pulls when you're 2H tanking where you need to pull your shield out quickly otherwise you're toast. 
---
I have a weapon switch macro keybound to "Q" for quick switching:
---
&gt;/equip "your 1H weap here"  
---
/equip "your shield here"  
---
/equip "your 2H weap here"
---
[Here's a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTEYkfSTaPI) of Bajheera 2H tanking, his rotation for the most part is:  
---
Charge-&gt; Sweeping Strikes -&gt; Whirlwind -&gt; Cleave or Demo Shout
---
Pre-Raid BiS you mean?
---
That Kingdom of Heaven reference tho.
---
That’s because you are a noob and not a veteran.
---
For what?
---
Thats just a dumb argument. Moderation in everything you dont need to add rocket mounts to the game just because you add dual spec. One doesn't follow the other, in a vacuum you can have just one nice thing without ruining the game.
---
The WC Raiding spec? Yeah haha i really missed having the slow from the blizzard
---
I definitely agree.
---
Is it that hard to keep your keys in your bank and if you get a group, while flying to the instance just pick up the key at one of the major cities?  I keep DPS and tank gear on me so I know all about inventory management.  I don't usually farm for hours with the thought of joining a dungeon.  Not trying to bash people but its just a key ring...I would rather Blizzard focus on fixing other gameplay/server/class issues.
---
Saved the best for last! Excuse me... *unzips*
---
Thanks for the great summary. Would like to point out that I don't see the weirdness in those connections you're making regarding PvP percentages. People don't roll PvP servers because they want to dedicate their game to PvPing. It's mostly got to do with their perception of what WoW is, and how much emphasis they put on this whole Alliance vs the Horde thing. Often, PvP rollers just want to know that PvP is a reality and a threat, and that the other faction is there and is to be taken into account by default.
---
Ask specific questions if you want. I should be playing but stuck in a family dinner. XD
---
I'm spec as feral DPS right now. Yeah I'm trying to avoid the gankfest lol
---
that is one fresh out the oven pasta
---
That clip is frightening.
---
Opposite faction gear did not drop for the whole of classic.
---
Lol. Sure. They're unbalanced. I agree. My phrasing has nothing to do with not bringing myself to admit they're horribly unbalanced. Haha. 
---
I said they're balanced because every class brings something different to the table. In a 5-man sometimes I am happy because we have a shaman (yay mama totem) but sad we don't have a mage (no water and quick damage and frost nova CC). Sometimes it's great having a warlock for that Soul Stone. Good rogues are great because they see when I'm getting nailed and they'll come stunlock the mob so I can heal. Druid have buffs to share, can off heal, battle rez. To benefit from some classes I have to go without other classes. That's what I meant by balanced.
---
My bird points to the left. ;)
---
I'm insecure about other people's intelligence. Especially people who voluntarily post on Reddit.
---
Searing Gorge will be the worst zone for leveling over the past month, I would avoid it at all costs until lvl 60.
---
I know a female but she is not on Sulfuras,
---
Right, but isn't that the end goal of most streamers? Yours (no offense meant in anyway) is a stable stream. Nothing insane in terms of viewers, but for sure nothing dead or dying anytime soon at all. A perfectly comfortable set up that can cover your life expenses and then some. 
---
Do you think this will break him? I personally don't, especially since he rides the drama wave twitch has had recently with talk shows and what not. I personally think that his WoW days are over, at least as the main content. I'm willing to bet that his manager is going to be pushing the cross stream interactions and talk show gigs a lot more now after the method dumping because let's be real, being dropped from Method (or any Org) for a reason such as this isn't going to have Cloud 9 or other random B rated orgs lining up to sign him again. His chance at the big leagues was ripped from him.  I'd be surprised if any sponsors at all want to touch someone who does something like that and then tells everyone to fuck right off.
---
He and his dad are being sued for millions for fraud in California and are barred from contract work in the state.
---
Yes, he's also a shit warrior and an annoying piece of shit, but he and his shithead father are also both actual frauds who have cost people their livelihoods.
---
How is this like Bezos? This streamer is now nothing more than a chump while Bezos remains the richest man in the world.
---
I'm not 100% sure but I think streamers having about as many subs as they have average viewers is somewhat normal. So say he has 1500 subs at about $3/sub thats 4500/mth * 12 = $54k/yr just on subs alone. Add in donations, ad revenue, and sponsorship opportunities and I think $100k/yr would be pretty reasonable. Probably a bit less.
---
Safe to say that would be a lot of people's dream job.
---
First one or two should always go healer imo, but after that I'd say open roll
---
Wrong? An opinion like this can’t be wrong.
---
Goretailwedontfuckshit#
---
Don't get your hopes up :)
---
Would you rather have loot or money? Because I would absolutely rather have money. He probably didn’t sign a crazy contract that paid him a ton of money....but even if he lost $100, I would much rather have that than an in game item. Who gives a fuck if he keeps the loot?
---
This will probably get deleted.
---
Thank god for dungeons.
---
How is it different than going to the movies or buying music? People pay for entertainment everyday. The only difference I see is that twitch streamers get a bigger price of the pie than other entertainers. It's a more direct way to support those who entertain you.
---
Heres a thought experiment. If you could pay extra when you buy the new Kanye (or whoever) album, to have him read a little personal note you wrote when you baught it, and he responds to you in real time. Would you pay extra for your favorite entertainer to do that? How much?
---
MT already had that binding. Other two tanks are Druids.
---
Went to roll for DPS classes, with the understanding that TF would have to be self funded or the very last once built after all other raid tanks have theirs.
---
You can also get one of I believe 3 pets with 1.2 AS instead. My choice was a swamp jaguar from swamp or sorrows
---
Arrogance and self awareness rarely go hand in hand
---
except the point of the shitposting is that he's agreeing with JunkFace
---
At most 2hrs since single layer. Not as bad as expected.
---
Dont you know blizzard favors streamers?
---
Automod wasn't happy with you using that particular f-word, perhaps consider using quotations in the future for your examples.
---
This is literally just the cookie cutter moonglow spec...
---
With great influence comes great responsibility. You become a public figure, you get judged by the public eye. It's just how it works, and there's no changing it.
---
*vanish
---
I'm ok with people making any offer they want. If they're looking for a dungeon run with all loot reserved and they find someone who doesn't care that all loot is reserved that's fine by me. If I don't want the items then why would I care that they're reserving them?
---
What isn't ok is when people have harsh restrictions and don't make them entirely clear ahead of time. Don't make me do half the dungeon before finding out I can't roll on scourgestones. Sure I can leave but you've wasted an awful lot of my time already at that point and were hoping I wouldn't be upset enough to bail after that much investment.
---
As with most things, as long as everyone communicates what they plan to do up front, there's never any problems.
---
"/use" and "/cast" are the same command, so everyone telling you this is the problem are mistaken. 
---
What you have looks correct as long as you're trying to use your slot 2 trinket and it doesn't trigger a GCD.
---
So I only am 47, do I just stop playing until they release BGs?
---
If you want some gold/bags/starter gear or whatever add Guinness if you roll Alliance or Lello if you roll horde and I'll get you started.
---
Honestly if you want to raid and PvP with optimal specs, you’re going to need to dedicate a significant amount of time to the game. You will need to somehow farm 200+g per week for consumables, respecs and repairs. Which is easy enough to do for most classes if you dedicate several hours to farming, but that’s on top of however many hours you spend raiding and PvP. 
---
Trying to rank in PvP and raid simultaneously is not something a casual player can do in classic wow, unless your class’ raid spec happens to be PvP viable.
---
People need to stop joining groups that reserve shit.
---
If hes a bear probably not often, but cat druids are very mana hungry
---
And this one made you look like a turd.
---
Haha me and 10 other of my friends started at launch. There were a few among them that were super excited and had played Vanilla. I was the only one to make it to 60 and I quit as well after getting my epic mount. Leveling was fun for me but the post game was just insanely boring.
---
In my opinion it can.
---
I suppose the question is whether or not he got terminated because he ninja looted, or because of how he acted on stream. The latter I can sort of understand, but the first? Not so much.
---
(I wish I could reply to all the posts, but because you guys keep down voting me lol I have to wait like 10 min between each reply. God forbid anyone has a real discussion on a forum! :D)
---
Yeah it was patched out like.. RIGHT before TBC.
---
I’m not lagging, you’re lagging
---
On Westfall I got the gloves for ~60-65g and the pants for ~93g or something like that.  They were at the time I was looking to get them on my hunter going on the AH as I was price watching about 175g for the set or something so slight discount. Every dps warrior I’ve seen in raids or dungeons has devilsaur on. Must have? No but it has become the status quo.
---
I read your comment and thought it was just some satire then i watched the video and holy shit the fuck is wrong with this guy?
---
Ok
---
Has blizzard rolled back the server 2 days before? That's what seems most unbelievable to me
---
nah, freeing up 3% not needed hit gear for crit/ap gear is a huge upgrade my dude
---
but muh staff of dominance
---
This is satire people, don't be fooled.
---
I don't know about most, but probably a disproportionate amount compared to the general population. It would be too easy to live in an echo chamber with all of your viewers, as well as gamers not necessarily having the most developed social skills.
---
wtf does this dumb shit even mean?
---
This is what I was saying.
---
Funny watching people get zealous over their own misunderstanding, but that's reddit for ya I guess.
---
You're not wrong.
---
12 button mouse and half your spells aren't bound and vital shit like bandage is on control f5 LUL
---
Lack of understanding of what opportunity cost is. So in that example my point was mining ore doesn’t make leveling engineering free. It lets you level engineering at the cost of what the ore’s opportunity cost is. Therefore is herb was better gold per hour, you could level your engineering faster with herb because the opportunity cost leveling engineering remains the same, even if you mined the ore yourself.
---
Another quick example: 
---
- 300g drops, who gets it?
---
- Edgemasters drops, who gets it?
---
The answer to those 2 questions should be the same assuming Edgemasters goes for 300g.
---
Most top guilds treat BOEs like this in Vanilla - WOTLK as after those Expacs BOE BIS becomes way less prevelant. It’s not an asshole loot system, it’s a fair loot system and for players that don’t quite understand opportunity cost they’re typically angered by the idea.
---
Does this mean if Priest Gear drops in MC that is BOE we all need it? No, top guilds either make you spend DKP (This is the most common case), or will take it and sell it for guild funds that supply mats for everyone (Like arcane or fire pots in MC). 
---
You could just give the priest their BOE, and it’s not a bad thing if you do, but it’s important to understand you’re basically giving a player X amount of gold. Again, that’s fine but you need to understand it’s not free, and it’s the guild saying “You’re worth X to us”
---
I remember back when I raided on a mage on a PServer and the guild master sold me my BOE bracers for half market value. His reasoning was I wasn’t in Pre-Raid and that BOEs are gold drops. So if I won’t take the time to gear myself why should the guild give me X amount of gold? So yes he was even nice to discount my bracers IMO
---
PvP you want corehounds for offhand hemo anyways btw, just due to increased poison procs
---
I like how he can’t talk too loud or else his parents legit yell at him 😂, yet thinks he is the best thing ever.
---
that's why he's saying the comment is going to get removed, because he's lying
---
pvp in your raid spec then
---
Narcissists in public view are given way too much credit. Regular people understandably seem to struggle to conceive of someone this egotistical and entitled. They think it must be some kind of a strategy. But if you've ever had the misfortune of living around someone like this, you know how real it is. There are far more narcissists in the world than there are Machiavellian geniuses, and it takes a deeply narcissistic person anyway to engage in abusive, manipulative behavior for profit. Most of the time what you're seeing is not a strategy, and by suggesting that it is you risk lengthening the narcissist's influence. "Players" or not, these people do not deserve respect.
---
QQ more pls
---
Sounds like they shoulda known you pve to pvp!
---
Shit maybe I should start ninja looting if an acceptable response to it is "just ignore him".  Shit I'll ninja loot an entire run and all they gotta do is ignore me.
---
That last guy: "hmm something's fucky here... onward"
---
I would actually manage if you wanted to discuss
---
We're headed for an Orwellian nightmare, but it's not because we're coming up with new ways to ostracize assholes. If anything that's one of the brighter points of humanity right now. 
---
There are some outlier instances where our over-zealousness for release from our raging justice boners, have taken things too far too fast, but it seems like we're reigning that in. But a new era of accountability and repercussions for your actions an Orwellian nightmare, does not make.
---
I am enjoying it.  It's my alt that I've levelled to 47 so far.  My resto shaman isn't very fun to grind with.
---
as much as you are you whining about reserves I'd love to see your reaction to what most tanks that aren't reserving do which is straight up not invite the classes that will roll on their shit to the dungeon at all
---
Dear God, I don't know what this wall of text is, just stop being a ninja if your group needs the loot. It's very simple.
---
All words are made words.
---
I don't disagree, I guess I'm just being naive about who can be a successful streamer. Like, I have no desire to watch people who are clearly terrible human beings play video games. That opinion does not seem to be shared though, lol
---
Where? 
---
Thought this is global
---
A lot of firms have a brand clause saying that you can be let go for damaging the brand. 
---
Not a matter of doing contract law but following the termination procedure. A lot of times that goes as follows:
---
Breach of contract
---
Suspension pending investigation
---
Investigation
---
Qualified personnel making decision
---
Termination
---
With small firms that can be someone gets drunk and posts something stupid on social media and they are fired as soon as everyone wakes up and responds to an email.
---
Pve isn't remotely balanced either. Idc about the lore. We literally have two factions that can't talk to each other and can kill each other.
---
No changes, atleast not this. Adding dual specs will make hybrid specs worse.
---
What you consider 'sensitive' is called normal human emotions, considering you come off as a psychopath I could understand why you would feel that way.
---
You want to PvP all the time?  Roll on a PvP server.  You want to mainly PvE with occasional PvP when you feel like it?  Roll on a Normal server.
---
Not a PvE server, a Normal server.
---
The literal name is a dead giveaway that Blizzard designed the game with a  PvE emphasis as the "normal" way to play, with PvP as a less central activity.
---
Yes, yes I am.
---
Okay, but that’s an absurd take. You don’t have to spec at all. You can spec fire but play like you’re frost. Sure. Whatever. 
---
But my point was that you can take a hybrid spec and not lose much efficiency at any role while leveling. Yeah, you *could* go all AoE grind spec and then take it into a non-spellcleave single target tank and spank group/do quests where AoE is impractical, but it’d be a bummer with long cast time frostbolt. You could AoE grind without taking talents to improve your chill effects, but it’d be slower. If you want to do both of those things while leveling, you’d be well served to spec for both.
---
Lmao what your saying is fucking stupid. I’m tired of doing dogshit dps in my PvP spec, but also not paying 50 gold twice a week
---
No you dumb fuck. vis'kag and brutality are the 2 good swords. CHT, Gutgore, and perditions are the good daggers.
---
The community is split on this. The idea is that if everyone Need rolls, it's functionally a Greed roll, without the risk of a single person ninjaing it if they see everyone else Greed it. The other half thinks that Need rolling on anything you're not going to equip counts as ninjaing, full stop. 
---
They're two different philosophies, and neither is wrong, but neither is going to convince the other that their outlook is right. There's a good reason that Retail eventually changed roll mechanics to make any Need roll BoP; so people actually used the buttons for what they were meant for.
---
Holy, specced into holy nova should be able to do it.
---
He is mimicking the streamers attitude and uses the same words as in the video.

&gt; 4 persons spending an hour of their life to feed some random asshat tank, wtf is wrong with people ?!

exactly. not trying to be offensive - but why the fuck would you not leave the group after the first loot "roll"?
---
&gt; The people who actually join these groups and give in to this kinda shit is a problem.
---
ding.

lmao i raid and pvp im my aoe farm spec i aint paying a dime scrubs
---
his biggest mistake was bringing up method after he did it. I mean I still don't think they would have kept him because he's really not all that big in the first place, but once he spoke the method name in his rants he was done
---
Can we have skeletons back now?
---
I've had my stuff restored, but that was on retail during Legion. So who knows.
---
That's just for the offhand though right? And can't that be mitigated by using the HS toggle method?

Client patch. Something that actually requires a download and bumps the game version. So far they've just been flipping a switch and enabling content phases. They said it's coming this year so hopefully not too long away.
---
Yeah. I'm not a big fan of memes after seeing the exact same format over and over. It's like doing stand-up comedy but you're just copying the person who went before you and changing a few words.
---
I'm well aware of the prebis I am working towards. You are focusing on the least relevant detail in the post. This is regarding gold gain, not itemization, my friend.
---
It had nothing to do with stealing the staff tbh. It was what he said that sealed the deal.
---
6% for yellow attacks
---
Batman*
---
I don't think it necessarily exploits people, but it's very hard on my server to get a BRD grp without reserved hoj, without making your own grp and there's just not enough tanks to go around. The only way for a rogue to get it, is by being lucky to create the grp who gets the tank, and have a group of friends willing to help. I think it creates a way worse ecosystem for a server.
---
I get why people hate it.
---
Same with this reply :..(
---
Pagle is actually, I think, the highest pop US PvE server.
---
Lol seems legit.
---
Method brought him on because he had a ton of viewers and they thought it was low risk to sign him for presumably a short term contract with high upside for them. What an actually fucking stupid assumption to make that they hoped he would make himself and the brand look bad.
---
The ol' "not my problem".
---
you need about 6k mana for that to be sure
---
Depends on the boss but we usually just assign a priest/pally to each OT and a couple on the MT. Everyone else is just raid healing unless it's a boss that needs dispelling, or one where the raid takes little damage like Garr.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Only requirement is the healcomm add-on, it works with every raid frame.
---
with a bre and arms spec it should be easier for pretty much all trash packs, sweeping strikes and heal reduce are awesome.
---
i think you should still use most consumables, but maybe you wont need so much oils of immolation (only for the undead packs at the start)
---
stoneshield potions are definitly recommended for some bosses like timmy, he hits super hard
---
you are comparing a game from another medium and style as a answer to someone who compare mmos between themselves
---
Oh I agree with you. I personally don’t have enough play time so I’ll either PvP as fury or raid as arms lol. Maybe switch it up once and awhile. I would love if they added dual spec or made respecs a little cheaper, but I don’t see it happening any time soon.
---
Poor Lava Surger just getting trolled by your raid.

what do you mean, this whole discussion started because "Jokerd the fastest leveling Mage" He's just **a mage** he's going to spend a ton of time leveling another mage. 4 days played time isn't nothing. He's out of commission. 
---
Do people not understand how mages work and how leveling works? He's going to level a regular rate. Unless he streams himself leveling all over again and uses his stream to get raids to power level him like asmon did but again, that defeats the purpose people will know who he is instantly.
---
My gf who played wow cheated on me so no lol
---
Usually we put 2 healers on the MT and 2 on the OT, the rest (usually 2 others) heal the rest of the raid.
---
I use Vuhdo, I don't know if it supports HealComm Library...I just hit the heal bars till they stop going down. :P
---
U right, but I was talking about the guy who was saying that the idea WoW servers are hosted on VMs was the dumbest thing he heard all day lol
---
lol just no
---
How about you make your own group with nothing reserved instead of complaining about other people's.... I agree it's annoying but you are under no obligation to join.
---
Wrong. Reread my post.
---
Thata a good point. Being a warrior, I saw the diamond flask and assumed everyone got something as nice. Yeah, I'd say that adding it alongside Dire Maul would've been fitting.

Trash threat is my biggest issue.  And really it's fine, it's just mind boggling to me that 2H still is kind of viable at 60 in the 5 mans.  Yesterday I tanked Scholo for the first time since vanilla and I had to use a 2H on some of the trash packs or I had very little rage.  On melee packs, I use a shield.  Healer seemed fine, even though he was 57.
---
Fury prot looks fun, but I'd definitely miss Tactical Mastery and the ensuing WW it enables for a quick pop between stances.  And I've read that it is mostly for people who overgear the content, which I do not yet.  
---
My weapons aren't great, which doesn't help.  Currently axe specced Arms using Dawn's Edge for 1H and Lord Alexander's for 2H.  I need to get a BSH and a better 2H as soon as possible.  I have the Dal'rend's main hand which I think I'd use if I switched to prot.  
---
Definitely not switching to full prot until I'm done with the majority of quests in the 55+ zones, which I skipped on my way to 60.  I need the gold.
---
Guy on my server is named AssBurgler
---
rogue opens on you, you don't have ice barrier nor ice block
---
Release spirit?
---
i dont change my gear, but the warrior equips mostly plate gear (like t0 shoulders) instead of leather gear like he does for raid dps
---
oh you're one of those people. At least barely anyone follows you.
---
An organization that's been around as long as Method almost definitely had their legal ducks in a row before issuing his termination.
---
Who do I think he is? Let me tell you who he is. He's the world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. He can do whatever the fuck he wants. You think he's a random player? You think he's a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. He's the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Him, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. He can do whatever the fuck he wants.
---
Yeah I was just looking into that, sounds quite profitable down the road but I've got some work to do first.
---
yes had the same issue, cant summon the first boss with only 2 people :X
---
&gt; Raiding in PvP spec - the content isn't hard enough that everyone needs to be specced perfectly. 
---
If I let all my raiders raid in pvp spec, easy raids wouldn't be as easy anymore.
---
Lets just get 8 Mortal strikes on the boss please.
---
4 corruptions, some curse of agonies... why not? oh look a serpent sting? who cares? Not me!
---
#The reason we can't raid as pvp spec is because the debuff cap doesn't permit us to.
---
Layering was only in the last few levels though, no?
---
Pvp is the way it is ment to be played.
---
and Asmon keeps a steady 30-50k. I think that says more about relevancy than a 1 time peak imo
---
I would be stoked if our server set up some pseudo BG between southshore and terran mill.
---
220 lvl 60 allies in Hillsbrad Foothills on Mograine atm xd
---
Go far enough out from the land and you hit the great sea where fatigue water begins. It there too keep you from going out of bounds.
---
lol thats funny, i think gnomes have a similar issue sometimes
---
something tells me he'll be back in EU servers now
---
COD mail him Mankrik's wife's bloated corpse
---
He layered for literally only the last 2 levels lmao, and never had friends with him. The uncontested mobs part is accurate tho, because every leveling mage and their mother are doing the jokerd aoe grind spots.
---
If you get a cheap one go for it but flurry axe is probably best and just get rivenspike for MH. Flurry can proc MH weapon swings and doesnt get replaced till bwl at least.
---
come on we need more meat for the meat grinder
---
i mean that was the whole point of them coordinating together on where they would play
---
Mine doesn’t like video games, but she watches me play FIFA. Live how anxious or hype she gets...though most of the time, she doesn’t know what’s going on.
---
Protect meee, I'm about to find 48 as an orc warlock on Kromcrush 😂
---
They can't "fix" it.
---
What an un self aware cunt. Got what he deserved
---
Meh I wouldnt care.
---
I can think of another reason why he'd want to break both of his arms...
---
wtf this whole discussion is jokerd leveling in AOEing again, the being "One of those people" is the entirety of this discussion. What do you think we're talking about? "Stamina health, Intellect Mana"?

---
&gt;ignoring the massive disparity in effort put into PVE compared to PVP 
---
It takes less effort to clear all pve content then it does to hit rank 14. I've raided in vanilla, I raided on private servers, and I'm raiding in classic. But I will never ever attempt the rank 14 grind, fuck that, no thanx.
---
You bastard.  Take your upvote.
---
In general no 1500 isnt bad at all but he was on an even playing field with Asmon for a while but his audience was shrinking more every day. He might get a small bump after all this drama because people want to see his reaction but those people are gonna abandon him real fast.
---
Only thing is say to the contrary is that two of the most powerful PvP items are offhands. Something you'd need to swap to or have with a good mainhand to begin with. Medicine pouch + ancient cornerstone grimoire for example(not to mention skull of impending doom).
---
To your argument they are significant cooldowns but realistically your average or below average player doesn't want to spend their 300g on 30SP more than once.  So most perfer to invest straight into 1h.
---
The server aren't.
---
Motherfucker uninvited himself from the BBQ. Good riddance.
---
I'm already pirating music and using this leveling guide on guidelime. Doesn't take much effort to redefine the rules.
---
Hybrid specs are already dog shit.
---
Bad design shouldn’t be excused, it should be fixed
---
&gt; You literally just said you can't tank4orbs, if it was valued he'd already have bought it, you idjit. You straight up killed yourself already.
---
I'm sorry you cannot understand basic economic concepts and/or appear to be borderline illiterate.
---
People are shitters. You blacklist them when they do it and if you're a rogue, you vanish so the mob engages them. Then you watch them die and spit on them.
---
What's you 'time to kill'? If it's over, say \~5 seconds, or you can't really AOE kill easily. I'd drop Skinning for something like Enchanting if you can solo dungeons (like Deadmines) or go Tailoring; Mooncloth is going pretty decent, and people are constantly asking for the CD with offers of tips.
---
I like that it shows HoTs with Healcomm but what would be even better option than disable would be for their color to be different.
---
What would make the mod so much better is if we could edit the color of the prediction for each heal type honestly. Green on my raid frames is fine but green on my default character is too similar to my actual health. 
---
Hopefully we can get some quality of life improvements like this to such an already awesome mod.
---
Yea his mom dropped him as a baby but that's not important right now.
---
People make a living off of ~200 regular viewers (~1-2000 uniques/month).  The fact that its narrowcasting (the viewers are a very predictable demographic and are actively engaged in the program) means sponsorship and advertisement dollars go way up compared to standard broadcasting numbers.  Then you add in donations which can easily be 1000 dollars/month/1000 uniques for a dedicated audience.  Plus patreon revenue.
---
Not really, no need to be optimized.
---
He could have at least kept with classic tradition and used a poop sock...
---
Imagine taking parsing in classic seriously.
---
I mean is the point not to keep people alive? If you can uprank, end with the same amount of mana, and do the same amount of HPS because you upranked spells because of your huge mana pool, then what's the difference? 
---
It's MC dude
---
Blizzard wanted layers.
---
The playerbase said no.
---
And we still do.
---
Better servers would be nice.
---
If another mage is using winter's chill you can be full PvP spec with arcane frost and lose no dps.
---
You are objectively wrong. Change your incorrect view.
---
I just never party with anyone who reserves anything. Your time and your contribution aren't any more valuable than mine. I'll roll if I need.
---
&gt; Ironically her got number 2.
---
What an absolute pissflap
---
A new copypasta is born! Rejoice!
---
Blizzard before the game even released: Please god transfer off the full servers, you are going to have a very bad time when layering turns off.
---
Forumtards: OMG Blizz get a clue fix gaem plz
---
As of right now there are 38 upvotes. 
---
We have six full raid teams. So no, we didn't all come in here and have everyone upvote.
---
... because even though I'm a Warlock and waiting with the group leader at the entrance, none of the remaining three wants to be the one to show up and help summon.
---
What about Loatheb then?
---
Lol what a little baby. " I don't want to continue playing if the other kids are mean to me" 
---
Grow up and move on. Dont group with them anymore
---
I seem to have mixed up sociopath and psychopath
---
The people in Method are NOT fucking around. They are making a stupid amount of money from WoW. Nobody ever has or will do it like they are to be very honest. They would kick fucking SCO if they thought he might harm the gravy train. I can't blame them. A lot of people are getting paid right now, risking everyone's paychecks so you can be an asshole was never going to fly. This is not a WoW guild, Method is a real world firm.
---
Pretty sweet how they wrote that song as a eulogy for Eazy-E
---
1 extra has a chance to be added into the economy from the world boss aka it wont affect it at all
---
And by "the year" they meant 2030. Clearly.
---
Without layering? Absolutely not.
---
lol.
---
Someone on the /incindious subreddit linked them, don't remember the exact site url atm
---
Still more than what you would get today.  Today you would just log in and find out you have a 3 day ban, and then need to go check your email.
---
This dude has like 400 viewers and that tiny amount of fame went to his head, to the point that he's unironically ranting "Do you know who I am?" to try to get out of trouble.
---
Imagine if he had actual fame and people actually knew who he was?
---
but everything on reserve so no weapon upgrades.
---
What you talking about, people compete with other players from their own faction all the time for resources.
---
I read your post correctly. I didn't said you said that wow was a pvp focused game. I said you were wrong when affirming no one said wow was a pvp focused game when several people in this tread actually said wow was a pvp focused game
---
have fun disconnecting!
---
For second I thought I was listening to athene the worlds greatest paladin haha.
---
honestly I hope so, to imbalanced and the server will die out for PVP
---
cries in level 53
---
I wouldn't bother attacking other than token damage.
---
Lag has not been too bad on Whitemane US. Haven't seen a chokepoint that massive yet, but it's definitely been 150 vs 150+ at times and felt playable. 
---
This update has been so fun so far.
---
Imagine thinking rushing to 60 first made you better than anyone else. It's not even an achievement he's had 15 years to practice. If this is his attitude he deserves to lose all his sponsors.
---
It’s upvote and downvote. Not I like you and I don’t like you. These votes are opinions in and of themselves.
---
Looks like grobb during phase 1 anyway lpl
---
rofl.. medium is more then a full server was on classic...
---
I think you should reread my post because your comment agrees with everything I said, unless you replied to the wrong person on accident?
---
I was going to ask if people genuinely thought there was a value differentiation between retail and classic, but then your post confirmed that people actually do.
---
This is what you are to become a world first level 60 in classic wow.  Nobody should be envious
---
The free transfer will not stop the lag from happening, are you dense?
---
underrated post
---
It's pretty obvious that you have no idea what you are talking about if you believe that 39 to 40 takes 5 hours when not even 59 to 60 takes 2 hours.
---
Uhh businesses aren't all wholesome. They are vindictive and emotionless. Everyone here "applauding" Method for booting him disproves your idea bringing him could make them look bad. They knew he'd fuck up, and they relished the opportunity to boot him and get praise from fan boys. They knew this guys attitude wouldn't mesh with a pro esports team, everyone with half a fucking brain should have seen this coming. Method exploited this guy who we obviously knew before this he had issues. Fuck Method.
---
I'd rather have your Devilasaur.

BrB telling melee to stand in lava on rag while I spam chain heal.
---
Fix ur guilds raid schedule then. Raid on two consecutive days every 2 weeks. 12 days pvp spec 2 days raidspec. Rinise n repeat, half the respec costs
---
Imagine having all that ego over a fucking video game 🙄
---
&gt;&gt; Temple of Atal'Hakkar 
---
Do people actually call it that?  I've never seen anyone refer to it as anything other than "Sunken Temple."
---
the only thing more useless than healing parses from molten core is a thread bragging about having the high score
---
You can solo lasher farm DM:E once you have \~6k mana. Until then most profitable is 2 manning DM:E with a warlock who has mining. Or 3 man with range dps/tank/you with someone having mining.
---
Why can't the factions communicate then? Why does pvp exist on "normal" servers.
---
Forgot Spirit
---
You both lose points for the gross misuse of the word "literally".
---
Hi Pills.
---
 2019 ATHENE ? a new GOD ?
---
There's a differnce their though. If your roommate wants to not deal with the annoying thing you did but still get to the grocery store in 10 minutes he can't. If someone is spawn camping me, but I want to relax playing video games, or even wow, I still can quite easily.
---
I'm leveling a mage alt to farm materials for my main and I wanted to kill myself after spending a hour doing Gor'Shak runs in BRD. The launch of phase 2 might force me to do it to avoid ganks, but if it wasn't for that I would surely choose doing quests in Plaguelands or Winterspring over doing repetitive content.
---
I don’t recall them saying they whispered them.
---
doesn't it expend your hearthstone if it can?
---
Lol, dude ruined his own life. Turns out professional orgs don’t like it when you make them look bad. Who would have thought? Nobody is responsible for ruining hid relationship with Method except for him.  
---
Also, who said this was about teaching him a lesson?
---
But you can get around those pretty easily too. Keep in mind that the identity of the hardware is coming from the hardware which is in possession of the illicit party so it's hardly an effective method. Plus it presents problems for legitimate users too - imagine buying a used laptop and finding out it can't play wow?
---
They won't even fix useless items like thunderstrike which literally ruins peoples time and you expect dual spec?
---
I wonder how much of the whole, "no changes" crowed even played classic wow.
---
I mean I was watch an asmond gold video and he was talking about no changes and it turns out he played only like 3-4 months of original vanilla
---
your names a damn lie
---
The addon slashfour does the same
---
Wow you suck at this PvP thing! Only one kill and the games been out what? FIFTEEN YEARS?!?!?   Filthy casual!
---
Na, they can both feel anger. also sociopaths and psychopaths are very similar according to the DSM. Anger is a proto-emotion according to google which is felt by them. I recommend just looking up what the terms mean. I don't have the knowledge to explain it well.
---
his comments after getting the staff made him look like a complete prick
---
This video needs music.
---
Honestly to me it seems more like the result of spending the last day and a half at the center of a social shitstorm.
---
The moment you piss off the internet, people from all around the world stop seeing you as human and anything evil or malicious that's done to you is rewarded as a good deed because it's *justified* and *you deserve it*
---
Honestly it'd take someone pretty resistant to social pressure, such as a sociopath, to remain completely calm on the receiving end of what he's been receiving.
---
I doubt any of us here would be much more relaxed than him after being unperson'd for a day and a half.
---
Though, I'd hope that few of us would be naive enough to think it's a good idea to stream while a struggle session is calling for your head.
---
what does that mean
---
Lmao I made the same noise when I went back and watched that
---
Meanings of words change all the time, do you not understand how language works? You know all words are technically made up right? You're seriously complaining because a word got a new meaning? Jesus that's a new level of snowflake I didn't know was possible.
---
They haven't been able to fix it in 14 years, why would now all of  a sudden?
---
It wasn't cobbled in, it was there on launch day. Unless you're talking about some shit that went down in beta.... from which I remember a bunch of pvp videos. Pvp may not be the seminal focus, but it was certainly a major focus during development.
---
Healing seems boring as fuck in general
---
Right. Imagine being method and not having a way to have any claim to fame in classic because the private server guys dont have to do retail race. They were smart to sign the guy likely to get world first 60 and they got a ton of eyeballs on their brand for it. I would argue that their swift and decisive response will end up being a boon for them, but it wasn't pre planned. I can imagine the executives were ready with the contingency but hoped he would NOT embarrass the brand and make it necessary.
---
Asmond’s raid rules are that he can take anything he wants. It’s annoying but people sign up for that
---
This has been super fun so far. 120 vs. 120 raids in Searing Gorge on Whitemane US with surprisingly little lag.
---
*Should I change from alchemy to tailoring on my mage (currently level 43), predominantly to be used for raiding once my main is geared up fully?*
---
I have been leveling herb/alch and I have no interest in enchanting, but I keep reading enough negative comments about the think profit margins selling potions and it makes me wonder if I would be better off just taking tailoring so I can make the Archmage robes and some of the Frozen Wrath pieces.  If I did so, I would still keep herbalism and I have several guildies who already have all the relevant recipes that can make stuff for me with my own mats at no cost.  
---
So, basically I would be getting the ability to make myself some solid gear, including the BiS chest for the next several months as well as craft disenchantable armor pieces to feed to my DE alt in exchange for losing transmutes (the recipes for which I would still have to farm anyway).
---
All streamers are sociopaths  
---
Asmongold bad  
---

---
Thank you for your attention, upvotes to the left
---
so, you got your entire group to stand in stuff while you spam group heal, and ask all of your 'healing core' to not snipe any of them?
---
there's a reason why healing / tanking parses aren't taken seriously...
---
Asmon doesn't pug.
---
Someone running a bot isn't a normal customer.
---
where does consecration play a role? at what point should i blast them haha
---
The only thing missing is a "bitch!" at the end :D
---
Rolled on a pvp server, complaining about getting ganked by rogues. A tale as old as time.
---
It would definitely be possible to have separate bars for incoming HoTs and instant heals. I have no experience with WoW's API for addons so it will take a while to figure things out. 
---
No promises that I'll go through with it though.
---
Not sure what the population is, but searing gorge is a death trap in phase two. It doesn’t matter what server you roll on, people will be hunting in searing gorge
---
500-1000 viewers and ur in the top 1% bro.
---
On bigger servers, the world bosses won't affect the price very much.
---
Smaller servers it very much will affect the price.
---
The only thing keeping the price high is hunters wanting to complete their quest.  The less raiding hunters getting their leaf, the less the sinew is worth.  On a massive server, adding 2-3 sinews a week isn't a big deal.  If there are only 3-4 guilds doing mc in a week, adding 2-3 sinews a week probably gives every hunter their bow.  Also it's important to note as each week goes by, there are less and less hunters who need the sinew.
---
Big servers mostly unaffected as the supply isn't increasing enough relative to the demand.  On a small server the supply very well might increase the supply significantly to counter the demand for the sinew.
---
No you already got that wrong. I was explaining why he said something. Then you started defending something I wasn’t attacking. After that the explanation started off with you saying something I wasn’t talking about (HS). The thing is you’re defending something I’m not attacking. So bottom line I don’t give a fuck what you have to say.
---
As a druid who is almost 52 I'm scared but also thankful for stealth and track humanoids

---
You're not wrong. He didn't say blizzard. What he did do was cherry pick one sentence out of an entire reply in order to quote it out of context.
---
There's better benefits systems in place, meaning he could survive living off benefits and nothing else (never work) which wouldn't be possible in NA.

When will you people realise that noone wants to transfer to your shitty small servers where nothing happens and lotuses sell for 15g. People want big realms where main things are happening, best players are etc, you saying this is player's fault is beyond stupid and you are part of the problem of why Blizzard has luxury of giving shitty service to its players.
---
&gt;constant feeling of not being good enough
---
&gt;I pretty much out DPS most with my noob gear
---
This doesn't add up for me.
---
Manipulating AH is bannable? What? Are there exploits to get things for cheaper or something?
---
The current meta is one mage goes deep frost for winter's chill, and all the other mages go 31/20 arcane/frost.  The frost talents are precision, imp frostbolt, ice shards, piercing ice, and then 4 points distributed in arctic reach and frost channeling.  
---
With that raid philosophy, one mage per raid could reasonably pvp in their raid spec.  Everyone else is kind of SOL.
---
I currently raid and am an officer in the top horde guild on sen'jin in retail (4/8M), still a few heroic guilds kicking but overall it's pretty dead still. Been thinking about trying to move us for easier recruitment but it gets expensive with a big group :(
---
Oh. I spontaneously forgot what the word 'static' means and though you were suggesting that most people wouldn't use 'dynamic' IP addresses. My bad.
---
HAHAHAHHAAHAHA
---
This means your raid took more damage than other raids. Kind of awkward thing to be proud of.
---
Yeah the huntard is dead since the invasion of spellcelavers. Rolling one atm on alliance. Tired of barrens and i didnt play alliance until wotlk. Might eventually roll a horde one.
---
A lot of guilds bring a hunter and a priest in on Domo and sell the Eye or leaf when it drops (it always drops one or the other). It will probably cost you 300-500 gold but if that's all you want then it will be much easier than joining a guild or trying to win it in a pug.
---
I shoulda just posted an Asmon clip talking about it instead and flown to the front page rather than acknowledge the community and raiders that potentially had an event thats never happened in Vanilla or Classic.
---
His job is streaming WoW, so yes he's getting paid for streaming.  Method will try to pick up all the big WoW streamers because it helps out their brand.  His manager is the exact same as an athletes manager.  They're there to expand your brand for you, get sponsorship's, negotiate contracts etc.  He wasn't fired from Method, his contract was terminated for conduct detrimental to the Method brand.
---
Here, have a quick bro hug.
---
that is highly dependant on what you are playing... having a few pieces of BiS gear as a mage or lock at level 56 means you are going to out dps decently geared warriors, every single pally regardless of gear, etc
---
If he does it'll only be because of how it effected him, not because of what he actually did.
---
Now.. That is what i call layering lol :D
---
What does that have to do with anything? Is he living in North America? Or are you just trying to get in a shot at the guy?
---
If you're trying to get a shot at him, there are so many ways to do it, I'm shocked you fucked it up that bad.
---
Same here
---
Did I offend you by overstating the amount of gear I had, or does my +healing effect an answer you are going to give? Or are you just correcting me for the instantaneous endorphin release you get when correcting people? Be honest with yourself
---
That's generally how it goes. MT then maybe OT if not highest dps rogue.
---
There's no content in vanilla you can't do in pvp spec. Join a different guild, dont change the game.
---
Hahahahaha aww man. That ego is so adorable. Poor guys gonna have a reality check one day. Feel kinda bad for him.
---
Things have already changed, we can have it on retail. Classic wow is for nostalgia and for some people to appreciate retail a bit more.
---

---
Pretty much what I'm running. But imp rejuv isn't really that good..
---
Rejuv is only really worth it on tanks right after a regrowth or a big HT, with the goal of maybe getting in some 5sr regen
---
The dps should really be smart healed/triaged.
---
So blanket tanks with regrowth and rejuv and then stick with HT rank 4 or 7. That's for trash, and for bosses I'd skip the rejuv
---
Your mana is just better spent going with direct heals that make use of your +healing

You think I'm a fucking random poster? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand karma playing this fucking site. Me, not you. The most upvotes ever on this site. The first guy to hit 60 platinums. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
im having the same issue on Firemaw right now.
---
I’m looking at is as less phonetics and more grammar though. Take for example the word representing, when written shorthand it’s “repping”, not “reping”. Of course grammar rules can’t really be applied one-to-one like that. I agree rezzing works better phonetically.

I play warrior and rogue but I swear this isn't that good, why is it.... Ooooooohhhhh

Why does he have to be happy for them?

Honor just went live so servers are getting hammered.

Wait until you hear about CamWhores, streamers are literally just CamWhores but they won’t even put sharpie in pooper for $5.

No, you simply didnt get it. And that’s okay.

Why would a tank look for another one? /s
---
He didnt get a single deal from another person/friend.
---
He abused layering for a whole 1.5 level (59-60).

Atleast get your facts straight if you try to bash someone.

stonespire, lag for about 2 minutes in an area with no pvp got dc now i cant log back in.

---
We actually have some level of communication though. So we have a ways to go for the D3 level.
---
peronsally speed is only a by-product of the fun of going with a good, well-optimized raid.
---
there's so few things going on in MC I just get incredibly irritated when a warlock can't babysit his banish target, when we must explain how to setup vuhdo / grid to dispell effectively, when people randomly break sheep and kill themselve on domo, or when we need a 10-min long explanation for a ''don't stand in fire'' boss.

something about raiding mythic for 6 years then getting thrown in a 40-man pug with sub-LFR level people who need help tying their shoelaces.

I asked for flying mounts in vanilla, but I also knew it was a pipe dream, or I thought it was

That's not how it "generally goes" at all. Putting TF on a rogue is idiotic.

at least in my server i have no issue, we had a 80vs80 fight and all good.  
---
Hopefully something can be done in other servers
---
The best part is the accent because it makes him sound like a terrible villain in some shitty Bollywood movie or something.
---
Vendorstrike every single raid and tons of druid/warlock gear. Reading other comments in this thread... what the fuck is happening?
---
I had no idea who this guy was, but I see why you are all hating on him. What a fucking bloat.
---
That is if you care about maximizing DPS. If you don't, which is not important in MC, then you can have multiple mages in deep frost.
---
The other dude knows this he's just making a dishonest argument.
---
Yeah, that's a hard pass.
---
Dual spec isn't in the game because you aren't meant to swap your spec often. What's the point of specializing in something if you can just change it at will. If you are raid tank specced then obviously you lose out in other areas. Want to raid tank *and* PvP? Do a hybrid spec. It's not that hard.
---
Same issue on Ten Storms for me, so tilted :C

Why the fuck would you ninja Molten Core gear.

In classic we had a warrior ninja Dark Edge of Insanity and transfer servers and it was arguably not worth even the small hit to his reputation on the new server... fuck ninjaing a good but not even great staff.

While I agree with your general sentiment, especially as far as public education is concerned, the fact remains that American Universities (a.k.a. Colleges) have produced more Nobel-prize winners than any other countries and that people from all over the world flock to the U.S. to get the best education they can get and according to [THE](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats), the U.S. has 16 of the 25 best Universities in the world.
---
Rip. Over one item though?
---
Alliance raided Thrall on Krom last night and the throne room was a standstill of lag, then you'd die without seeing a frame for attacking or abilities.  Tough man.
---
Myzrael, same issue.  Blue post stating DDOS again.
---
Hey sounds like a shitty version of Athene World's Greatest Holy Paladin
---
It doesn't work. It's up to the SUF developer to add this functionality.
---
You could try Luna Unit Frames. It was developed from SUF and includes this heal prediction/sharing.
---
1 billion percent daggers.
---
As others have stated, there's a big difference between a fully optimized raid and one that is not.  You probably won't get an invite to a raid that is optimized for speed.
---
That said, there might be a handful of guilds on big servers, maybe 1-2 guilds on smaller servers, that actually care about optimizing right now.  MC and Ony aren't that hard.  Get established with a group, get them to like you as a person, and you'll have a raid spot.
---
Do you know who the fuck I am?  I'm a casual player with a job and a family! I haven't even maxed tailoring yet!  That's who the fuck I am.
---
No rank 4 for u
---
The biggest thing that causes raid times to balloon is less how good/geared people are and instead of focused and active the raid stays.
---
Yes obviously a raid full of the best geared plays kills stuff real fast.  That raid is also not going to dick around standing at a boss for like 10 minutes for loot to get distributed.  In MC, this could add like an hour alone.  You don't have to chain pull as the prior shit is getting low to put up a good time.  You mainly need your players to stay focused and active for about 60-90 minutes and a decent raid can clear MC.  The issue is obviously keeps people from AFking constantly.  Having people know how to react if they pull off a tank, or getting people rezzed if there are deaths.  TOo often raids grind to a halt because something happened and like 6-7 people died.  Everyone stops while those people get rezzed and buffed and wait for mana and suddenly you are sitting there for 2-3 minutes.  If this happens a couple times you have just added another half hour to your raid.
---
Even a raid of mediocre gear and mediocre players can get mc done in about 90 minutes IF they focus.  It doesn't really matter the specs as long as it's Druid/Warrior tanking because paladins are ass, and there is an adequate amount of healers who aren't incompetent.  Finding 35-40 people who will focus for an hour is often a chore though.
---

---
I think DM east is the best gph. Strat is way too rng.
---
It costs half of everything and your kids every other weekend
---
Reroll a mage.
---
maybe, but rly tho it diminishes the importance of bag management
---
You know what role playing is? It's the RP in MMORPG. You can choose to be evil in-game, and the server community can deal with you, as is Blizzard's actual stance on that behavior, in-game. An org policing in-game issues, especially ninjaing an item in a non-competitive pve pug raid, with IRL punishments is beyond ridiculous.    
---
So many people high-roading and pretending like they would have known this would be the consequence for doing a mechanic Blizzard made possible in their game.
---
just got 1dk ... No idea about the price
---
I'm sorry, we can't speak to you anymore. You will be shunned forever more.
---
Same thing happening on Ten Storms-EU
---
This is a terrible list to link lol. The boomkin in nr2 and does a top dps of 800, a good mate does around 1400 or so. It’s sorted based on performance vs rest of class as opposed to top raw dps.
---
&gt; Layering was not for starting zone control as stated already by Blizzard. There is a lot of first hand experience here to attest that even with layering the starting zones were full to the brim.
---
This is absurd, if you have 5 times the players competing for resources then you'll get 1/5th the resources. It doesn't matter that the starter zones were already full, they would have been even more full. The extreme overpopulation at the beginning demonstrates how important layering was in the first week of the game.
---
Also - server transfers are just as much about filling up low populaion servers that suffered dropoff as they are about helping to empty high pop servers. Server transfers are likely to exist throughout the games life cycle regardless of population changes and they don't indicate high or low population relative to the original predictions (which we also don't have any hard numbers on).
---
There's definitely more than 5 active guilds still but I can only speak for horde although they are mainly heroic only. Mythicwise there is only 2 guilds still on there, my guild &lt;Dusters and Dragons&gt; on horde and &lt;Symbiosis&gt; on alliance  (both at 4/8M) And the server merge was at least in MoP or before as that's when I started playing on QD and was in a sen'jin based guild
---
It also is their way of showing support. They like the dude, they want him to do more stuff, here.
---
The same idea as donations I guess, but less spure of the moment in payment. I only get one from Twitch prime, use it sometimes if I feel like it.
---
BRD is way better as arms. Same with strat because of the groups. I do just fine in UBRS as fury.
---
Prot is only needed when everyone undergears a place or in raids.
---
The word of the day is hubris.
---
And that my friends is what you call a inferiority complex
---
yea wtf name reservation certainly isnt launch lmao i even remember a friend telling me that he had his name reserved and a sub bought in advance preparing for classic wow and that was months before. Launch is when they are ready to fully release a game to the public not when they want the public to be able to reserve a freaking username in the future lol so stupid

Once you get to 60 it turns out that pressing your frostbolt button in raids over and over for weeks and months is not fun at all. Mage is cool in outdoors and somtimes in dungeons but it also has an extremely boring and annoying part to it.
---
Why are you being downvoted for the truth? Lmao
---
So we're supposed to take some bimbo bitch's word for it?
---
Yeah you gotta have a solid amount of raid gear to 2 man
---
Free for all lets anybody loot anything they want, no rolling.
---
55 here and this post is giving me anxiety
---
The moment those trying the boss will down him will automatically have more dkp than others not doing it, also the player are more or lesa always the same (5+/-)
---
Ok boomer.
---
You expected downvotes for being on reddit but not because you’re being a douche yourself?
---
If they didn't want people to swap their spec, then why have it in the game at all?  It doesn't trivialize anything and it didn't trivialize anything when it was introduced.
---
The problem wow had was that much of it's concepts were driven by people who had minimal basis for how to actually design an mmo.  They brought over EQ players who had weird draconian ideas of what raiding was, but then had an entirely different team designing PvP.  It was essentially two games being crammed into one.  Neither worked very well with the other on how the mechanics work, so you get some strange shit.  Going into the one meant you were terrible at the other, but going both mean you were bad at both.
---
Your argument has only ever been used as some weird thing to blame on what happened in the game, but it isn't based in reality.  Dual spec didn't harm the game.
---
You'd think so but...
---
Classic wow is not for nostalgia. It is for having fun. The two games are completely different and for that reason you can not just argue for people who wants dual spec to go play BFA.
---
What? Compare it to the rod of the ogre magi and it's way way better in every stat.
---
Method knowing he wouldn't be able to fit into their culture and would eventually fuck up isn't what I would call a conspiracy theory. It's not that far fetched.
---
Probably not. Couldn't kill the last boss as effectively, but..maybe? At that point you may as well 3 man it with a tank. It's all about trying to get 5 runs an hour.
---
Yeah I saw that one, thanks. I was avoiding it as it seemed too comprehensive/heavy for what I needed, but I guess if it works then why not.
---
I only want my friend to loot though
---
You kinda got your branches mixed up there...sir. 😀

---
I just looked him up... he joined on October 30th, or at least that was their press release. And gets kicked November 13th. Literally 2 weeks and he was out.
---
I got a real Athenelol vibe from that outburst lol.
---
Welcome to classic wow where 90% of the player base is bad but think they are good so they meta game everything.
---
There was speculation that Blizz secretely upped drop chances the first week when Eye of Sulfuras dropped week 1 for a major streamer
---
Yeah I don't understand how anyone can watch or support Asmongold. I turned on his stream once and he was bragging about scamming people back in the day. Pretty scummy guy.
---
Gee, least the staff he stole was aptly named...just had to try to show that dominance man.
---
And the sad thing is I'm sure he'll be fine after this to live a long and happy career of video game streaming and waking up at the crack of noon day. Then again, based on some videos of him, maybe not so much on the happy part. 
---
Least he will always stay humble and grounded in his own mind.
---
All u guys are fools if u think this is anything more than a troll and a joke. Hes a streamer trying to entertain, and by the looks of this thread he succeeded.
---
I mean the record clear is like 28 minutes. Realistically let’s say an optimal raid is 45 minutes.
---
The kind of raid you described would take 4-5 hours to clear rag. Might take multiple raid nights for awhile.
---
So optimized raids are say 5 to 7 times faster
---
Imagine having 30%+ overhealing on every fight and thinking you're good lol.
---
Lights hope chapel is a shit show right now. Only about 80 people there though so it's pretty good
---
More like **isMale** but you got it.
---
He's only been part of them since October 30th according to their website. I'm sure future income yes, but he was still pretty new to them which probably made the move easier.
---
If you see the loot system change and they pull, let them die. What's the worst that could happen? A wipe?
---
Not as bad as the take that calls a real word made up. Dare I say you are toxic?
---
LOL you're in for a rough time boo. Flight masters are camp spot #1. You're not honorless forever and you can just be sheeped/feared until you're worth honor.
---
These guys are either dumb or just have some personal vendetta towards Druids.
---
I think you're out of luck, unless you make it free for all and tell them ahead of time "hey I'm boosting my friend and he's getting all the loot, you're welcome to stick around for the free/easy/quick xp but all the loot is his, so don't loot anything"
---
over 9999 now haha
---
same here, Skullflame is fcked
---
I don't think you're gonna get many serious replies to this, and i'm really not sure how to reply. A lot of abilities in Hearthstone are related to abilities in WoW, including from later expansions. But really you don't need to know either game at all to understand Hearthstone
---
You bring up a good point with the off-hands. Still not a case for the staff being shit though.
---
Some people don’t just dislike Druids, they HATE Druids. It’s usually warriors for some reason

I can't use zone chat for some reason. Typing anything starting in /1 says "type /help for a list of commands". How do I fix this?

---
Needing on BoEs in PUGs is not a ninja. You will only embarrass yourself if you go after him for this.
---
People need to correct their views on BoEs. Just because you can use it or have the profession does not make it yours. Blizzard will do nothing for you in this case, and no one else is going to care that you felt like an item was yours.
---
Holy Priest, hit chance talent for holy spells
---
What a stupid comment. It's about the money
---
Were the wipes due to gear/spec? or player error? How long would it have taken with no player error? Would it have still been possible?
---
I love druids.
---
The Method org is just that, an organisation. A business.
---
If you're in a contract with that organisation you have most likely signed a contract stating you can be terminated if you do something that would damage the Method brand.
---
I don't get what's so hard to understand
---
I get what you're saying and it does make sense. i have talked to some and the feedback i have received has been positive. obviously not everyone is going to like whatever system is in place but the hope is they at least think it's fair. I will ask around more because i know we have a good group of people and i wouldn't want animosity to grow over loot.
---
shazzarah is a lag fiest atm, everything is lagging and teleporting
---
You could make youre friend the group leader and they could set master loot. I think you can switch the quality of the item which can be master looted to be white items.
---
Well, Bye.
---
as long as you dont kill the horde players trying to finish IN DREAMS quest, i hope you make tons of groups!
---

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I was first to ding to 60 on my home planet, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Stormwind

I like to bind, I like to be bound!
---
Wow
---
Don't stress! The joy is in the journey, not the destination.
---
Woah you guys got the hat trick too? Very interesting. Wonder if it had to do with semi-standardized loot tables rather than a more pure RNG system. What server/guild?
---
The fact is he dod both so who cares?
---
Guys. He's  going to start TRIPLING down on his normal assholeness on purpose so he can be the "bad" character. There's a community of people willing to watch that. Call him out for this shit.
---
So if I don't show up to raid for a month and then show up one week and win a roll over someone who has been consistently raiding you consider that fair?
---
Or how about someone being raiding for 2 months and then loses a high value item to a brand new player who just joined that week?
---
There is a reason most guilds do either loot council or DKP.  It rewards consistency and loyalty.  Plus there are other ways to contribute to a guild other than "turn up to raid and not AFK" like you state.
---
Lmao
---
Thex
---
Did you leave general chat? Type /join general if you did
---
Faerlina has been fucked for 30 minutes now.
---
Are you a mage?
---
I mean this is the logical way to do it. The only other acceptable outcome would be if any other hunters who have the sinew are also given the chance to roll on the bow. If no others have it, then it should be yours by default. You're quite literally the only person who can use the leaf right now, since you have the sinew already.
---
Looks fun, we also tried this but there was 3x more horde so that was fun
---
Twitch emotes on /r/classicwow. Bold strategy Cotton.

Sure but "pp" still makes the hard P sound while "ss" generally makes an S sound, not a Z.

But I know what you mean.

Pretty much everyone is “in” Method on twitch
---
Wow classic doesn’t mean a paper copy of the original game and all of its events guys. 
---
Just look at the differences we already have between vanilla and classic.
---
Yea it happened in 2004 and 2005
---
You can do it with int greens off the AH.

What's so special about him?
---
TBH that's one that'll fly over most people's heads, and GMs won't ever just look through lists to find names with naughty words.
---
No, but if this were chess, the example would be the level 20 having only a king, and the 60 having 10 queens.
---
Or in COD if you want to use that example, one guy spawning with the nuke.

Our main tank is a warrior but we have a flexible druid who is a monster at tanking 5 mans and raid adds. Outside of a few questionable specs * moonkin * there is room for deviation. I wouldn't turn down an enhance sham if our raid's healing is fine and we want more totems, for example. Just make it work for you. Hell, maybe even moonkin is fine sometimes.

Then again I would be on there after last night. Hunting named mobs for quests. Saw the dude spawn, earth shocked him and then all the sudden I see mage shit firing off. Mage had been camping his spawn for a long time evidently and I ran by at the right time and didn't see mage sitting up above me on a rock. 
---
Apologized but still got a shit load of /s flack. I genuinely felt bad cause I know how much that shit irks me. So now I shit in general chat I'm camping it if anyone needs it. And ask anyone approaching if they need the mob.

Of course he cares, this is his entire life

Well, thanks for showing everyone you're a moron.  Makes it easy for me. :))

Look at all the alliance

That's the kind of answer someone that realized they can't answer back but can't admit he was wrong would give.
---
Why are people replying to me with conjecture and conspiracy?
---
My comment was neutral and just relayed the information OP wanted.
---
I said absolutely nothing, not a single word about why Blizzard do what they do, I just said to OP that that is how they do it.
---
Of course you are entitled to not believe the Blue posts, but take it up with them on their forums.
---
I am not a Blizzard employee or sycophant, just a regular guy who answered a question then woke up to all this nonsense.
---
quest rewards
---
Yeah, especially since you'll want your tank to be fury. Some of the mechanics can be really punishing if both of you aren't playing really clean, too.
---
There's another top post with a clip of him being so full of himself it's ridiculous.
---
Everyone should stop helping him now tbh.
---
But if you're going to call someone out (i.e. OP) then you should be prepared to have a discussion because, after all, this is reddit and reddit is a public forums.

And what are forums for? You tell me so I know we're on the same page here.

Yes, yes it's true.

Yeah I guess it's worth it to rip the bandaid off. I may grind my last few Pre-BiS pieces and set aside all the int pieces I require, and when I'm sick of doing that I'll buy any remaining pieces to reach that 6k mana bench mark. Thanks for your insight.

It's a mass race to get people logged on for World Bosses now. Fully expected them to not be ready go to at reset.

Not much in it for the dps unless u plan to offer all the drops to them. I helped do these runs all day with some guildies and i barely made 15g between rolling on the loot to vendor between 5 people. Doesn’t help the miner rolling on loot too since jump runs are basically for him to farm the nodes.

Would it be fair to assume that both groups have equal access to any potion/buff they need? My idea is that group B is just as dedicated as group A but don't care about class/spec (you could even assume they decided to do this for "challenge")
---
If that assumption is made how will both groups fair?
---
Was killed like 5 minutes ago on Ten Storms aswell
---
For whatever reason, the guilds i run MC with (Horde sulfuras) usually have at least 3-4 women in them, plus my guild has a couple.

Strange that Alliance from your perspective is a sausage fest.

The original solution is to create an alt for pvp.
---
2-3 rich thorium
---
on nerzhul PVP was minimal/non existant, shit people stopped doing the dailys when progress was at about 50% and 4-5 raiding guilds had to do all of the rest of it themselves and it took forever
---
They're all masochists
---
Lol I used to play on the same server as advertise back in late vanilla/tbc.  It's not McConnell, he's just a really good priest.  Possibly the best arena priest on the battlegroup at the time, dude probably could have made it in the tournament scene tbh.  I also wouldn't doubt if he's not streamsniping, him and a few other guys from stormscale horde were kind of notorious for tracking and hunting "high profile" targets down in the open world back in the day.  
---
tl;dr, Advertise is just a really good player taking advantage of streamer's popularity to boost his own stream/youtube channel (which I don't think is bad or wrong in any way)
---
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh let's go bois! Grats to &lt;Invictus&gt; US-Skeram
---
Well at least he's probated from method and probably on his way out.
---
Server?
---
PvP against the dead faction yayyy
---
Was on princess and it wont let ne log back in
---
 We got over 100vs100 going on at Kargath and it's about 4000ms
---
I literally posted proof, not my fault people are too dense to read/achknowledge it. I’ve yet to see anybody link me real proof that shows players being banned/items removed.
---
That seems like an odd comment, the incidentally bit.
---
So, i could take an hour to get Darrowspike, or spend most of a week grinding the gold for Sunrazor.
---
Not sure that's a really good argument.
---
The AH prices on my server are fucking lunacy most of the time anyway. People are relying on private server data for price ranges, and then wonder why nothing sells. Then different people post the same shit for barely more than vendor price, which just boggles my goddamn mind.
---
Adorable. Delish. Ok, definitely a tween chick. That explains all of this and why you have no valid points.
---
I'm gunna save us both the headache and turn off notifications for this post.
---
Have fun yelling at wall ya cunt haha.
---
What's the respawn time?
---
I'm thankful for that.
---
You seem to think that there is some point. What if there wasn't one? What are you going to do then?
---
You get them when you kill civillian NPC's like flight masters or vendors. 
---
Pretty sure they don't matter very much now but if you're a high rank one DK can erase weeks of work.
---
Operative
---
Mom, Meatloaf!
---
Hahaha. Your assumption is stronk.
---
You think it's ridiculous for an org that cares about its image to remove a guy who steals from other players, has an overinflated ego, and then acts toxic about it? You must live a very sheltered life.
---
You can choose to be evil in-game, but the people and organizations that don't want to appear evil won't want anything to do with you, and you can't blame them.
---
If you actually aoe farmed you would know resists aren't uncommon. Even a 60 farming ZF will have 1-2 mobs resist almost each pull
---
That wiki is wrong. I had almost full nemesis in BWL before AQ and it was the real set. the upper looks was the tier2 BEFORE BWL release.
---
Not with phase 2 he couldn't.
---
OMG reported for threats to my safety!
---
lol we can't even log in for more than 5 minutes here.
---
Spoken like a man who knows his 15 minutes are almost up and is trying to drum up controversy to extend it by 30 seconds.
---
That sounds a lot more annoying for everyone involved than just saying what you're reserving in the first place.
---
Ohhhh.... No! My fun...
---
Someone's about to get catfished.
---
This has a Battle of the Bastards vibe and that’s awesome.
---
Advertise does not stream snipe, and the fact that Asmon and Esfand say this every time they are found is incredibly funny and no different from kids calling someone a hacker simply because they got outplayed.
---
Advertise is living rent free in Asmon's and Esfand's head, and it's funny how pathetic Asmon's supporters are when all they do is parrot the same dumb shit he says.
---
That's true. A no rank 48 is a free kill. A lvl 60 might just give you a corpse run for your troubles.
---
Play diablo 3.  Bam!
---
Group B is not a pub. They are a seasoned guild just as capable as you. The varied classes are a result of preference, no inadequacy.
---
I love how you and everyone else says "min maxing isn't important for MC".
---
Do you think I want to spend 4 hours in MC?
---
If youre running with 5 people u doing it wrong
---
I don't find them challenging.
---
Ok you do have data to support, but I keep wracking my brain on this.  I distinctly remember the T2 Shaman helm dropping quite a bit off Onyxia and don’t ever remember it looking like that.   Its so distinctive in the revamped form.  It’s possible that all of that was after the AQ patch, but we were killing Ony weekly for months prior.  All of our Shaman were sporting the Ten Storms look and we had two 40 man raid groups (welcome to early wow).  I still have a hard drive with all the old videos and screenshots but unfortunately can’t seem to get it to work anymore.  
---
Anyways, you’re probably right but I do admit my memory was also saying it had to have been earlier.
---
Dead server
---
Zandalar Tribe.
---
No, I deal this logic to the stupid shit that comes in droves on a blizzard based game web forum.
---
Just wait half an hour and you'll get a post about how flying is the missing element in Classic Wow will make the game 10x better.
---
If OP had a good suggestion that wasn't saturated in angsty bs, I wouldn't have been so blunt.
---
Sounds like he’s trying to be Athene... but a shit version of it.
---
In addition: Tanaris, Eastern Plaguelands
---
I love all of this lmao. Meanwhile i gave staff of dominance to a lv 59 mage in our guild over myself that same night lol
---
Your point being?
---
You need to make a choice. Join a sub-optimal guild and raid with pvp spec, or respec and join a parsing guild.
---
Or cry like an eight year old on reddit.
---
What does "Ninja'd" mean?
---
TIL not wanting to be killed repeatedly in fights where you have literally zero chance of winning is being entitled, lol.
---
Yay?
---
&gt;  Additionally, it gives an advantage to hybrid classes, as they are designed to perform multiple roles without significant talent investment.
---
No it doesn't, it serves to punish them because they are made shittier at each to justify their ability to do both.  THis is a documented thing blizzard did, they called it the hybrid tax.  The idea is that a hybrid wouldn't be as good of damage as a pure damage class.
---
You are saying it's great game design to make everyone play around with shittier healers just so they don't have to get the ass end of ever doing anything outside of specifically being a healer?  This is part of the design of why paladins are fucking ass at virtually everything because blizzard was terrified at letting hybrids be really good at anything but healing.
---
It was bad design then and it's bad design now.
---
&gt;Ready to destroy the ~~Alliance~~ *server* in Phase 2!
---
FTFY
---
RIP Blizz servers
---
I wouldn't equivocate training your body years to some neckbeard who used a spreadsheet to find the fastest way to do something in a video game. One is obviously more impressive than the other. One obviously has more value than the other. They are equal in terms of interest, which is personal. You can find the best quarterback in the world not interesting, but can't deny it's not impressive.
---
There is no reason not to be, why be toxic?
---
i think they're blaming them for their shit servers but maybe i'm wrong
---
It wasn't that he ninja looted that got him terminated, it was his attitude and how he represented Method.  He said "Method is OK with this, Method WANTS this" He put them in a very very bad light, which is basically rule 1 of things not to do.
---
Logically sound.
---
Well it seems it was if you understood my point and replied.  But ok, spending 3 minutes to save 2 minutes is not more efficient.
---
Didn't he use layering for like 2 levels when he was already super far ahead?
---
Maybe I'll try it.  Thanks for the thoughts.  I definitely have better weapons for dual wield at this point than I do for Axe Arms.  
---
Shield slam and concussion blow are definitely why I would go 31 prot.  
---
What are the "must have" Fury talents on the way down to 31?  
---
I kinda like the look of this [8/31/12](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/05003-05050131405010051-5023011).  
---
I guess the 0/31/20 looks like something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/-05050131405010051-502501105).  I left a point out because it could go basically anywhere.
---
Grats, you have a lot of free time.
---
From what I gather they've turned into some kind of entertainment management company and were sponsoring this guys streams.
---
&gt; A lot of abilities in Hearthstone are related to abilities in WoW
---
Yeah, I understand this. But the related abilities are in/from Retail WoW, and I'm wondering if the HS abilities cards are "generic" enough that they still feel like they are related even to Classic WoW. Or if HS's representation of WoW abilities decidedly feel Retail.
---

---
I would agree with you if you were a druid, but overhealing with hard-cast spells is inexcusable and especially when you're thinking that you're somehow a top tier priest. It's a mixture or overgearing the encounter with DPS and smashing the boss that causes you to not go OOM early and allowing you to simply spam carelessly. Not your "superior" healing talent.
---
Some you aren't killing, but easing their suffering
---
Damn you butcher
---
Every 2 weeks?
---
Can’t be buying gold like that my dude
---
Wait did he actually say this?
---
I mean, not really, you just don't understand how it works.
---
How much have people been selling the mature blue sinew for? I've tried to farm it for a couple weeks now and am about to start spamming to buy one instead.
---
I’m so glad i picked the outnumbered faction on my server. Having nobody to kill sounds like a nightmare.
---
he watched too much jon zherka lul
---
I'll laugh when everyone starts saying "holy shit why didn't they do this 2 years ago?"
---
L8er virgin
---
Congrats.
---
Faaaaack I don't want to give the guy the views but he also streams?  I'm really curious to see what sort of mental gymnastics the guy does/see what the second most 3rd most punchable face in wow looks like right now.
---
"hey guys I have a GF :))))"
---
thanks for telling us, OP
---
A decently geared prepared guild will probably do MC in ~1 hour if they're tryharding.  
---
A similar guild taking a bunch of meme specs will probably be hour  longer than that based on the dps differential and the fact that the meme specs (ret, enh, elem, boomkin) are mana inefficient and most of the time spent in raid is clearing trash.  When most of your dps has to drink after trash you're going to easily double your raid time I think.  Maybe less or more depending on how many meme specs and if you have cb/prep rogues and ms warriors.
---
But with that said, I've never seen a guild that takes a significant number of meme specs actually tryhard (full consumables / world buffs) because that mindset tends to attract people who want to be the fastest / most efficient which means not running a meme spec.  
---
I would expect a typical raid that takes pvp specs and meme specs to be about 4+ hours.  Could be wrong though.
---
It is a combination of them both, the attitude alone wouldn't be enough to kick him out, plenty of people in Method are overly cocky. If he didn't ninja the staff no one would have complained in the first place.
---
Yeah man, he definitely hangs out with the hottest dudes that's for sure, I heard he's really good at tossin their salads. mmm salad.
---
All i know is it does make a difference when opening on someone. They wont see you coming where if you font have the talent they can see you if you dont open fast enough
---
Right now DKs wont really effect your ranking so thats the good news.
---
As for why, they added them to prevent either faction from controlling a city for a long period of time and preventing the opposing faction from leaving.
---
Personally I think there should be a better mechanic to prevent long term town camping (like if 20 horde players are in Stormwind the guards become stronger every 30 minutes) because I'd love to be able to actually raid a city and control it for a small period of time.
---
I haven't even been able to get "into" the game for real. I always keep switching classes and faction all the time. Highest level I got to was level 20 warrior. Think I'm gonna make a paladin..
---
ah thanks.
---
Whilst the majority of us chase those honourable kills and rank rewards, I wonder if anyone is aiming for epic numbers of dishonourable kills..
---
Well I've never done this myself, but people are paying hundreds of dollars to watch their favourite rockstar so maybe watching this the new generation of that in some way. It's someone delivering entertainment after all. 
---
Now you may think it's shallow to think online dating is sad but in 1999 I was already doing that in those first years people would look at me weirdly when I said I did, at the time, by anyone other then tech nerds online dating was considered to be the domain of creeps and losers. 
---
Nowadays if you meet someone in bar people look at you weirdly and everyone is doing Tinder.
---
I would rather suffer the economic consequence of dual spec than have to farm an extra 100g a week.
---
Sometimes you’re  in stealth....  
---
And then you don’t want to be in stealth anymore...  
---
And then you in unstealth.
---
Welcome to Classic WoW, where the sweaty tryhards are in overabundance.
---
Truthfully, I'm not sure what else you expected come phase 2. Being in that situation sucks, for sure, but it wasn't hidden or unknown what phase 2 was going to be.

This is Shatter the mage the the left. Grats To Lifted my guild and The Boys who were also part of the Kill. Thanks to Solenya for being a great MT.

Allies were trying to ruin my solo attempt so i just sat in stealth following him while he mopped the floor with that patrol. He literally solos everything cept when he's suppose to die
---
Later pussy
---
All mana users can use them for raid.  Mages and locks included.   They're off the gcd.
---
Casual players and players who believe PvP only belongs in BGs shouldn't be playing on PvP servers in the first place.

Hahahahaha! What a jack ass!

I don't mind giving $5 a month so that my favorite content creator can create content full-time. Generally, for me, this has been people who also have a large youtube presence and production of funny, interesting, or informative/helpful material. I've never been interested in the more immature/cringe-worthy streamers. I have subscribed to DrDisrespect early during PUBG beta and Trick2g several years ago. Those are probably the least mature streams I've ever supported or watched on any regular basis. They were both personas that didn't take themselves seriously, though. 
---
Without some monetary support, these people can't play/edit/compile videos on a regular basis because they would need a real job to support themselves. I'm OK supporting some of these people. That's the answer as to "why". Now, I've never once donated money other than a subscription (and never more than one active subscription at a time).
---
Wow we really do live in cancel culture now. People are so happy and ready to cancel
---
You'd want a link to an imgur album, probably.
---
I think he's running some weird sex cult. For real. Like it's not outwardly one but it's some kind of commune where women live free and the men have to pay Athene to live there. And the disguise is it's about people doing work to change the work and some other vague shit. Can't imagine why the girls would get to live for free....
---
It's once again an AOE party, like everything else in this game
---
This is how I feel about the implementation of spell batching. Why simulate artificial lag to replicate a server limitation from 15 years ago?
---
Relax, I'm lvl 41 and I play every chance I get. Enjoy the ride
---
Why would you ever need to unstealth are you a newb? I play a mage and can farm ZF 40g/hour minimum. I think I killed a gray player once. Yesterday I saw a rogue for the 1st time why would u ever have to unstealth just git gud
---
Tbf once they stopped changing their voice and it sounded like McConnell but I doubt he'd do that
---
it's been fun for us faerlina players lul
---
Supporting streamers you like so they can continue streaming. Ads pay peanuts.
---
PVE server, cupcake.
---
I'm a hybrid HoTW druid who tanks MC/Only/etc as well as heals it.  Tell me more about how I can't do what's already being done.  This build works all the way up to Naxx, but by all means, repeat elitist literary diarrhea all you want.
---
LMAO. DDOS?
---
What do you think the numbers are on each side?
---
I've been thinking about this a lot.
---
Why are we so willing and engaged to improving our world of warcraft character, but not our real life character?
---
Why are we reluctant to improve ourselves, with the same enthusiasm and passion as we do our world of warcraft character?
---
I'm not sure why. But I'm changing my mentality to become obsessed and enthused about improving myself, as much as I am about improving my character.
---
I dont think quitting the game is the right option. I think you can enjoy the game (in moderation of course), whilst still working on yourself.
---
I have a few castsequence macros I use. /castsequence reset=5 Air Totem, Earth Totem, Water Totem, Fire Totem. Make that macro, using the actual names of the spells you want and the order you want. It will then cast them in order each time you hit the key. (so if you have it bound to 1, you would press 1 and the Air drops, press 1 again and the Earth drops, and so on) It will reset at the end, or if you go more than 5 seconds without hitting the macro. 
---
You will have to think about what you want for the reset timer and the loadout. I have three defaults I have that I use based on what I'm doing (solo, group, who is in the group), and a fourth that I change at the start to match a situation. Of course, most things should be bound anyways, especially the more situational totems like earthbind and grounding. 
---
Is this what you were looking for is is there something more that you had seen?
---
Just sayin, Asmongold came out to defend Jokerd.

I imagine dungeon entrances will be danger zones too. Maybe try sticking to questing zones that are in the green level rather than the yellow so you don't aquire many people higher level than you.

Nice.

They only signed him to say method got world first 60. No way they bring him back. They already said he's been terminated. You won't hear Method mention him ever again after this.
---
Can you link the source for that? Not questioning you but im curious. I thought the most updated source was from September
---
Again?
---
It's like you dont even know what's going on lol
---
Whatever that witchdoctor looking one is with the voodoo doll is my favorite of the set.
---
So from my understanding you would raid Monday/Tuesday, right?
---
But that leaves you with wed,thurs,fri,sat,sun still. You're not saving any extra gold by doing this.
---
Their design choices tell me that pvp was always planned to be a core part of the game. Otherwise there would be no reason to have two opposing factions that can kill each other and are unable to communicate.
---
Dude you're right, making 50k a month watching youtube videos
---
Fucking sad
---
GIVE IM THE GAT SON
---
World first to tell you to fk off nobody cares.
---
Because each town has it's own graveyard.
---
I don't like PvP. I particularly don't like world PvP. That's why I joined a PvE server. You should have done the same.
---
it's one of many way to top healing parses... it's not exactly rocket science, people have been cheesing them for years on retail, you won't be teaching any tricks here that haven't been done a hundred time already.
---
the point remains : healing is a zero-sum game, there's only X amount of damage going out... and in MC it's a very small number.
---
you either have your 'stellar healing core'' twiddling thumbs or have people intentionally taking extra damage... there's no need to 'look at log' and find out how you managed to keep more than 2 healer busy on magmadar.
---
Post your logs we also downed him already
---
Don't assume someone's faction! Geeze :P
---
Partially disagree. It does matter when it influences how you treat others. Now another party is involved and if you’re treating someone like crap there are usually consequences. Just my opinion.
---
&gt;it's one of many way to top healing parses... it's not exactly rocket science, people have been cheesing them for years on retail, you won't be teaching any tricks here that haven't been done a hundred time already.

There should be a screenshot button on a keyboard ... wait there is!

just believe blizzard, they are telling us the truth!
---
I  was having this happen in my mid 40's and I totally get the frustration. I can't remember what I did but it stopped sometime around level 50 and hasn't happened again since. It's a really, really annoying bug in pretty specific scenarios.
---
Not just AoEing mobs for years, but got it down to a science such that they could speedrun a game that's nearly two decades old during every waking moment.
---
don’t play WoW, what does “ninja’d” mean? never heard the term in other mmos i’ve played
---
There are logs regarding what everyone says/does, why should we supply something to the GMs that they already have?
---
The servers are still down for like half the people playing yet Phase 2 has ruined the game for everyone already.
---
Thank you! It matches bloodfang nicely
---
I think he's talking about the disparity in effort put into PVE and PVP by Blizzard, not the players.
---
Except you would spend that additional gold on flasks, potions, boe items, etc etc.  You wouldn't be farming any less gold.  That's not how it works, the money would just transfer into everything else and you will still be farming more gold.  Whether you respecced or not at that point.
---
Telling people to go fuck themselves and disrespecting NA is not something other method members do lul
---
The world first Azuregos kill happened roughly 14 years ago.
---
Can somebody please explain if you need to get a higher number of hks or more honor points to be ahead of others in the ranking?
---
Because expecting a subscription game that you paid for twerking function properly from a company that makes billions upon billions of dollars is just crazy right?
---
People like you seriously need to just STFU and stop stifling discussion on legitimate issues.
---
Blizzard has been making games for who-knows-how-long, 25+ years?
---
how many of those years have they been making online games use servers? 20? 
---
you think that after 20 years of doing the same thing wrong over and over that is justifiable if they continue to fuck up the same shit they've been fucking up for 20 years okay that makes sense....
---
Same reason why someone will Tip a waitress or bartender.  You don't have to do it.  But if you think they did a good job and deserve some extra you do it. (although some cultures pretty much make tips mandatory which i think is bullshit, and those cultures need to learn to pay their staff better)
---
That's totally your prerogative, and there's nothing wrong with it. There's also nothing wrong with some people giving $5 a month so that they can support someone who creates content that they like. That's so obviously apparent as a reason. If NO ONE supported them, then they couldn't create content. 
---
Whether or not 95% of the content and/or streamers are garbage human beings isn't the point. I didn't mind giving Voyboy my "free" $5 a month from Amazon Prime, something I'd already have regardless, in order to continue being able to entertain people.
---
DKs are an immediate rank reduction. Since you can’t get past rank 1 this week, there’s no loss. They’ll be troublesome next week.

Don’t blame others for your bad choice.

I am sure its down pretty much everywhere. Venoxis like 20min ago too

You don't say that! Yoni is dope af dude.

Yes it was a joke based on how you worded your comment. There was even another commenter that replied "choosing to spell cleave at 60 is different" implying he absolutely thought you meant doing it AT 60.
---
good riddance to bad rubbish.
---
Yeah you will be grinding dungeons anyway, might as well be a tank for that :D
---
ok, boomer.
---
You could always say screw it and get 68, 419, or 1336 more then really focus on honor next week.

let me know when you get it figured out, deep breath didn't kill me week 1 but it sure as shit got me week 2 lol

World first in classic obv. Dont be jealous man.

umm what? You are going to want to do business with the people that support the bad guys?  Look at the whole Blizzard-China thing, no one roots for the bad guy.... It hurts their image as he is representing them as a company.... If they don't do anything it appears that they support everything he did.  That's basically their only purpose as a company lol

Does the 1 DK I currently have make it harder to progress in the future? Or is it nothing to worry about and just be careful to avoid further DKs?

I’m biased but make your bear a lava belt ;)

Follow up question; if you request a long, expensive ride but get off at an earlier stop, do you pay for the shorter ride or the long ride?
---
Somebody piss in your cornflakes this morning my guy?
---
Ironically, on my server more of the PvE guilds raided cities and the PvP guilds stayed away from them.
---
I need a WoW version of /r/OutOfTheLoop.  I have no idea who this is, or who his team is, or why I should care about any of it.
---
I thought WoW Classic trended towards an older demographic.  Surprised so many people are into streaming.
---
Contrary to popular belief, it isn't the end of the world.  Plenty of people level alts once honor kills are a thing.  Might be more painful, but not worth skipping all of the open world over.
---
Yeah, i choose to be good and a positive influence in the game. So i'm sticking to my RP by being autraged by this behaviour.

In a perfect world people with no clue about a specific topic wouldn't spread their factless opinions before researching. Sadly, you have no clue about IT infrastructure and software developing. But you're good at being polemic. Fits the world.

If you’re constantly getting orange healing parses, it’s because you’re healing way too much. Usually by overhealing or intentionally fishing for parses, or the slim possibility that your group is just really awful and requires that much healing.

I believe DKs are percentage based. An early DK wont really do anything.
---
He started using layering at 58 and also had several server firsts on private servers were layering did not exist.

At the end of the day, he still has the "I was the first to 60 in wow classic, and I WAS a part of Method"

He has viewers the same reason Asmon has viewers, it doesn't matter anymore if he actually is good at the game or not, if people genuinely like him or not. People will watch him for drama and as long as he gets hits/views, he gets money. As long as he gets money, he wont care who from. 
---
So this cycle of behavior will continue.
---
Interesting how reputation matters. Almost like the community wants a healthy game and environment.
---
Do it, join the dark side, we have cookies.
---
But mentally.
---
I still remember Hillsbrad during this time being an absolute shitshow. It was beautiful.
---
That strategy does work but it's not what he's asking. He wants to know if he can kill the Princess, log, and then log in and loot it on his Warrior I'm pretty sure.
---
Oooh ya got me.  Guess I better go suck OP’s dick for managing to clear 15 year old content.  Thank you wise one for helping me realize the error of my ways.
---
World first Kazzak was 15 years ago bruh
---
Nobels and prizes don't mean shit.

Really happy to play on this server, a lot of good guilds and players

Ashbringer eu,  both dead in one hour after they spawned.

Guy is a total piece of shit.
---
Who asks for help while lying, gets called out for it, and smugly rants at the person who caught them lying?
---
Haha for classic :P
---
Can recommend RClootcouncil. Great addon.
---
Um... you do this to one shot and clear MC twice balanced before and after the reset.   It takes an hour to hour and half to clear MC in a decent guild and less than 3 in a pug...  
---
Since your either trolling here or have a learning disorder.  I am out of this conversation.
---
I thoroughly enjoyed that
---
And do you think Daniel Day Lewis should face consequences for acting like a dick in Gangs of New York, or There Will Be Blood? See that's the weird part. You see an entertainer putting on a show and think "This guy is a dick!", passing judgement as if you're somehow affected by someone who has nothing to do with you. It's super weird.
---
Does not mean its not idiotic. Thunderfury is a bad weapon for rogues
---
What I find so cancerous about him is that anytime you search for anything on youtube related to WoW that awful face pops onto your recommended videos.  No matter how many times  I tell youtube im not interested or report the video for misleading content they always pop back up.  He sold his soul to google or something.
---
ACKSHUALLY
---
The main things that facilitate speed running are:
---
* Having one person collect all the loot, handing it out after the raid, and not counting loot hand-out time as part of the raid
---
* Chain-pulling trash and bosses, facilitated by having healing chug pots on cooldown, druids innervating during trash, and cycling who gets to drink on which pulls
---
* Zero/minimal deaths (so you don't have to wait on res/rebuff/drink)
---
Composition (e.g. warrior stacking) can shave off a few minutes but the above three factors are what take you from an 1-2 hours to ~45 minutes.
---
&gt; Absolutely zero reserves are allowed for any role or class in my tanking runs. I will not tolerate entitlement and greed ever.
---
&lt;3
---
Ah rip, guess they are spawning on lots of different servers. Pretty cool tho
---
That the same thing to be honest, and stream sniping is not really against any rules anyway (except tournament)
---
I think this is what they call Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
---

Why is this bring upvoted? Keyring will be out later this year.

This is like the 10th+

Shadowforge Key (Blackrock Depths)  &amp;nbsp;

Key to the City (Stratholme)  &amp;nbsp;

I doubt the average player is going to carry all those on them.
---
Not even the first. First guy did it back in 2004 :P
---
Ragrets be purged!
---
Thanks, I've joined the discord too. Thanks for sharing.
---
This is ticket worthy.  We had this happen in vanilla and the GMs honored our tag as we technically had the loot rights and could view drops.
---
Wow tbh hadn't really thought of that the second part that is.
---
Yep. As soon as someone extends a little to far from the group, they are immediately targeted and melted. Honestly it's a fun way of fighting because it becomes more about the group formation and less about targeting individuals. 
---
Also, anytime you see a large clump of enemies (or friendlies), every AoE class pops out of the woodwork and starts throwing down. Don't clump, don't get singled out.
---
I use it because I cant find anything. I havent found that it impedes what im going for in personal terms of experience. It's a tool for me to prevent frustration burnout.

Everyone has an opinion in the internet sadly. Even on topics they understand nothing of.

Just as I suspected. 100% trash.
---
I played the original wow like 3 months after it was released...pretty sure there was more than one server?
---
That's just not true. The game launched, and had in beta, pvp servers, dueling, pvp flagging etc. They fleshed out pvp rewards later for people who wanted ONLY to pvp and couldn't get into raiding guilds to equalize the more casual players with the gear hardcore players were getting. Just because the honor system came later doesn't mean pvp wasn't baked into the game, it was.
---
Could you link to a profile of your gear and the warrior's gear? thanks
---
Yes every single second is being spend together

No you aren't the first. Yes, they are spawning on other servers besides yours, why wouldn't they

Because pservers offload work onto the client which allows gaps for exploits, blizzard can't do that

Well of course, none of the boys in this game actually know about the female anatomy. They wouldn't know what it was if they were looking right at it.

Hit level 60 first on the remake of a game that came out 15 years ago.

I guess some people just really have nothing going for them.

Shout out to  Xenif (troll rogue) on Stormreaver who hit level 60 in 10 days in Vanilla with no glitching, aoe, layering, guides, or audience.

No where near world first, off by several thousand... days....

well, ddos or not, doesn't really change anything for me today, wanted to get some questing done before sleep, literally every zone is ganked by 60s on Gandling right now, and I had no time to wait for any dungeon groups, no playing today :/
---
XD
---
You’re not understanding. You spec for raid. You raid Monday night, then Tuesday night, then switch to pvp spec. Now you have 12 days until the next Monday. You spec twice every two weeks in this scenario. You spec at the end of week one, beginning of week 2, then not agin until the END of week 3.
---
Normally you would spec for raid, raid, spec for pvp, then in 6 days spec for raid, raid, spec for pvp.
---
S a l t
---
Exactly, i was wondering what the point of showing up to this raid if you are melee.
---
Seems like 95% of the dps will be the AOE
---
Fury off-tanks, anything but rogues.
---
You really took time to write this whole thing that isnt funny
---
I'm also pretty sure it needs to take advantage of game mechanics. If you join a raid with ML, and they ML stuff in a way you don't like, that's really more of an interpersonal issue.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world top healer in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 1,151 healing points playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most points ever on this game. The top healer. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
Now as he has more free time, he should join Athene's cult. I think he'd fit in there.
---
Impressive is subjective, sure, but there are some objective differences in the amount of talent, effort, luck and work ethic comparing a professional athlete then somebody grinding WoW.
---
Absolutely. PvP versus horde is expected, as our guild can easily dispose of the other faction while fighting the boss - however we can't do shit against Alliance.
---
Winning a 3v1 to cap a point in Arathi Basin as a Lock.
---
Can you get more than just Classic WoW sounds to play?
---
I just moved here as Horde, and the census is showing a lot of horde moved here the last week.
---
One of the top guilds &lt;Smash&gt; is here now and so it should get interesting.
---
Sure... but unless you propose any other way to model regen from spirit, trying to take it into account is futile. When you do figure out a model, add it to your M variable and crunch. Without some kind of math model to work with, we're just going to dance around words and opinions.
---
That said, I'm working on a follow-up post to contain stat weights with mp5 and spirit as well, which use the total time of the fight and time out of 5sr as a parameter, and includes meditation talents.
---
Around how many HKs to get PvP trinket?
---
DKs reduce your current rank points by a specific amount immediately after they occur. It’s not based on the weekly reset, nor some daily reset people in the comments have mentioned. It’s immediate and impacts your rank points, not honor.
---
You only gain rank points after the weekly reset. Which is calculated based on your contribution points compared to everyone else on your server. Based on the amount of rank points that can be awarded to people in the top bracket, it’s possible to reach rank 4, after the first weekly reset because there’s no decay. 
---
So since this is the first week, everyone currently has 0 rank points. Therefore, there is no effect from DKs this week.
---
Later on, DKs will become detrimental to people ranking. It will set you back in your progress.
---
Yes, again. You have no idea what you're talking about. It never worked better in Vanilla because it's the same fucking backend code. This game was never developed for 500vs500 fights. Their Backend doesn't scale like that. Deal with it. Learn some CS and then you can start shittalking
---
gorilla warfare, and not guerilla warfare.

He's talking about Harpy Hide Quiver.

AV honor-reward that give 15% attackspeed but with 2 less ammo-slots.
---
What amazing life achievement
---
What’s up, just a cool guy here looking for other cool guys to hang out in our party discord. Nothing sexual, dudes in meta spec prefer, but if you play Druid we expect you to find humor in the little things. Again nothing sexual!
---
How do they actually have enough Hypogryphs
---
Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaa oh my hahahahahahaha
---
I ran around while dead to see both sides and they were literally all over the area, probably 250+ on each side, lag city
---
2 charges sure, but when 10 hits come in at the same time, all 10 get the +75% chance to block.  That's what I'm saying.
---
The HK are on?
---
Beyyyyyyttttttaaaa Pepega :mega:

Make a discord server and use the Raidplanner/Raidhelper thingy.

Cesspool is better, describes the average skill of their members
---
GZ ally scum :3
---
It's our turn next time!
---
Awesome guys thanks for sharing
---
&gt;It's a tough one though in some cases, when it comes to loot it can become he said she said type arguments. What's stopping someone accused of ninjaing claiming they said over discord that the item was reserved at the start of the run?
---
Nothing. Nobody is arguing that they should do something about that. People are arguing that they should enforce the rules they made in 2010, where if you agreed on rules in the in-game chat prior to the encounter, those rules must be followed.
---
similar for us.  we have had 3 daggers drop, one 2h and i think one 1h sword but maybe 0.  
---
we also have gotten zero rogue boots and just one chest for our 5 rogues.  
---
i can't really complain much though as i only need 4 more items to be bis
---
Ye, ashbringer is a fantastic server. Massive pvp everywhere atm

Twitch viewers, more like.

so ur server has less than 200 players?

Stfu

Looks sick can’t wait till I get home

:O
---
sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it
---
Yep that's right. The old addon will most definitely have the .mp3 or .wav files.
---
I played on one of the biggest vanilla servers in 2005 and onwards, the only thing the servers couldn't handle was the AQ opening. Every massive PvP battle outside AQ and BRM, every city raid and whatever else NEVER even got close to this bad. 
---
That was almost 15 years ago, let that sink in.
---
it seems like you can't even read properly

A lvl 60 rogue getting trampled by 60 alliance

if this was firemawEU there would be 40,000 undead mages and about 12 afk alliance players

Disenchanting Runs as holy Priest are not that bad and definitely a source of income.
---
You get a large radiant shard for almost every boss, which sell for 3,5 - 4 Gold. Some packs are really difficult, but it is not impossible. Shackle is your best friend. But It is not that time-efficient to be honest. At least I did not manage to optimize it properly, mainly because I lack the routine in there. You will have to drink often.
---
Spider Boss is possible for example, use Nova for the small adds.
---
Imagine being 60-40 on a sever and posting screenshots like this
---
Imagine not knowing by this point that blizzard dont give 2 cents about theire servers, Nothing will be fixed and people will compain and quit! History will repeat itself.

I had the money over a month ago, it was the grind to exalted with Darnassus that took more time and $

OP is probably referencing an old blue post from Vanilla: https://web.archive.org/web/20050525020704/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=blizzard-archive&amp;t=27&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post27
---
I have not once experienced this anywhere on my server.
---
So I'm not going to presume to tell other guilds how to distribute their loot, but I will say that back in Vanilla, there were several hunters, rogues, and paladins who had TF simply because at the time the first bindings dropped no one knew what they would create. And even once people did know, its massive threat bonus wasn't also immediately known.
---
That's definitely a contributor to the high number of Vanilla rogues with TF.
---
Really, though, depending on the politics of an individual guild, it might actually make more sense to give it to a rogue whom you know will stick around than a tank who might ditch at any time.
---
Guess he can't do whatever the fuck he wants
---
Some of the felcloth gear is actually better than warlock tier (for pure DPS) because it's just +shadow damage. The gloves are especially good.
---
Also, warlocks can and do use dark runes. Though obviously saving a few GCDs isn't as important as refilling healer mana.
---
Personally
---
Quit being a pussy
---
I'm told that this is all completely reasonable and we just must be too lazy to start my own group if we think it's silly.
---
The burnout may also be due to that levelling bracket being fucking miserable. Once you hit 60 it gets a lot better, man
---
Seriously? Instead of actually supporting a real fix you suggest a mere band aid solution that doesn't work? How moronic can you get?
---
Wait, given how Jokerd reacted when he ninja'ed and how he tried to "explained it" reminds me greatly of Josh, and... talking of him, you know the one banned from Twitch for something to do with some female streamer (Name withheld) is he still with Method or was he dropped?
---
To think, the allegation he has for banning and is still a member of Method, but ninja? Oh boy
---
I say allegation because we have zero information on what the hell happened, perhaps twitch overreach
---
wanna compare monthly paycheck than?
---
I remember briefly playing on a Private Server, fully geared Death Knight with the badass 2H gladiator axe, slashing around gurubashi arena
---
I mean, if you don't have good gear, you probably should have a good spec.  A bunch of pvp spec people in blues and greens is going to be very slow at best.
---
Personally, my guild killed Rag for the first time last weekend, second attempt on Saturday.  If we kill him easy this time then I'll switch out of AP and hope that doesn't make the difference.  But if EVERYONE in our raid did the same thing, we'd probably be screwed.
---
Are these in the current tos?
---
You arent playing 500vs500 mate
---
Isn't cdew from method too? He's so great as well
---
Always need on boe blues or higher, everyone needs gold, this is not ninjaing
---
Oh, I need to learn CS before I can criticize a multi-billion dollar company being unable to provide a service that is even comparable to what basement dwelling troglodytes manage?
---
It has NOT been done better. Blizzard servers are doing SO MUCH more things behind the scenes. Validation on every tiny step, communicating with bnet, preventing data loss etc. etc.
---
Private servers are JUST working but there is no safety or whatsoever, which you want when you pay for something. I don't want to defend blizzard, but you got no clue.
---
It's not okay to not be able to have stable servers in 2019 but you are posting bullshit.
---
Think of all the cases you use wotf. Locks and priests and sometimes warriors. 
---
Now think of all the cases you use escape artist. Mages, warriors, rogues, shamans, hunters. 
---
Now realize that dwarf priests have a WOTF that doesn’t eat a GCD.
---
And before I hear how much better shadowguard is for surviving than fear ward, let me tell you about desperate prayer.
---
They still have that moron TipsOut on their roster though, right? Have you ever listened to his raids? He's the definition of unsportman-like conduct lmao
---
Blizzard really dropped the ball with the world bosses and i bet greifers won't even get warnings.
---
Go to Southshore and report back with your findings. It isn't even remotely playable.
---
Stop ressing at your body. Res at the spirit and change zones
---
No, it won’t have any effect on your progress for this week. 
---
DKs immediately reduce your rank points when they occur. Everyone is currently rank 0, so nobody has any rank points yet and you cannot go negative.
---
Next week DKs will begin to have an effect though because you will begin to accumulate rank points (assuming you got over 15 hks).
---
I don't agree with you, why do you think that?
---
Oh shit, before I read this comment, I half-thought JokerD WAS Asmongold.....
---
realistically unless you are going real deep dive on which specific quests and rested and the like you will probably look at 5-6 days played trying to speed level yourself.
---
Just happened to me on Drak in UBRS.  The tanks were all conflagged or w/e and he died and our two healers let both tanks die lol
---
Im on flamelash eu and it was shit. Def not a big server issue
---
Lmao Lucifron did that to us Tuesday. Soon as he went down, the priests stopped dispelling Doom and half our raid died as the MT was posting loot into the raid chat. Discord was dying.
---
he's trying too hard to be edgy
---
If you are getting crit often enough that redoubt makes a huge difference, you aren't lasting long anyways.

Disgusting behavior by these Return and North guilds. Especially since the guild they were griefing has a reddit mod in it. Don't they know who they are f\*$%ing with? &gt;.&lt;

or complaining that the store is closed after they forced you out while shopping
---
People way overdo it because they're greedy.
---
Sometimes it works and you'll see people being screwed over. Sometimes it DOESN'T work, and you'll see the same group spamming for an hour.
---
It's fine in moderation, but people (as usual) are too greedy.
---
Usually you charge pugs an entry fee,
---
this might sound ridiculous, but leveling a warlock or a hunter , or even a mage might be a good idea to make gold. a fresh 60 of all 3 of those with little effort to gear would lead u into awesome moneymakers. for a warlock grab enchanting, just need to be level 1 for disenchanting, and herbalism and start farming mara solo's. its pretty relaxing and easy and around 50g/hr. For hunters you can solo dm tributes which would require at least 200 engineering, and a fresh 60 hunter would probably be clearing in 24 minutes or so once they learn it. Easily 60g/hr and pretty fun IMO. Finally mages have there most iconic aoe farming! Not that knowledged on this one but i think you just enter zf, summon zombies, and aoe em down. not sure what else there is to it but these 3 are all great money. of course leveling an alt is quite a journey as you just got your main to 60, but having them to be pure gold makers would be great.
---
I feel you but we gotta live with the consequences of rolling on a pvp server. I am lvl 47, I wanted to do some questing today, no matter which zone I went I got jumped by several 60s instantly. Only mindless dungeon grinding is left now xD.
---
5 days game time to hit 50 then another 5 months to hit 60 i guess.
---
I don't know how it didn't age well. If you actually read what I posted instead of being too concerned about whether or not you're right you'd know what I conveyed has nothing to do with thinking he shouldn't be punished. 
---
I think he's an asshole and guess what, method doesn't want assholes representing their guild. 
---
It wasn't hideously reprehensible; they just don't want ninja looting to be the impression people get when they think about their guild. It creates distrust.
---
All I said was he isn't a fucking sociopath and Redditors overuse the term and there you go overusing it again.
---
yea but ToS has changed. You can collude now with other faction and blizz are 100% hands off with classic.
---
Asmon, is that you?
---
Yes, ward. I just know that mages have them) Forgot name.
---
How so? If the same people keep running together eventually everyone gets what they want. Instead of gear being funneled to gm buddies
---
My server has a larger population than any vanilla server did, and has never had a queue or lag even when raids run into each other.
---
i dont have any clue about being worth billions of dollars either but im sure i could hire some people to figure out how to make a 15 year old game work, seemed to work for europeans working for free
---
Also just FYI, nice try(s) to the Alliance guilds who failed twice!
---
That seems like an efficient use of resources.
---
There is fighting on boats because corpses respawn on the boat when it changes continents. Just fought a raid vs raid on Menethil boat to Theramore.

I never know what to do! I wanna dungeon with my guild but it takes half a week so set up 1 run then our tank keeps leveling his alt with the lowbies in sm
---
??? 10 manning an instance isn’t punishable. You’re a moron.

Should they ban people who have high levels carry players through SM now? That gives way more XP/hour

hitting level cap in a game that's been min maxed for over a decade is an achievement?

If he was entertaining on stream he could have leveraged that into a good career though. Or could have used that to get youtube famous with content videos.
---
I would absolutely fix my own car. this is exactly the point I'm trying to make people like you seem to think that because someone does it for a job that if you don't do it for a job then you can't fucking know how to do it possibly.
---
Again people like you are the problem. you're assuming stuff about people you know nothing about your assuming I have no knowledge about a car that I absolutely could fix on my own. just because you're a skill this moron doesn't mean everyone else is.
---
and because you're assuming that you're also assuming that I know nothing about how computers or systems of servers work. I can tell you that I absolutely do. I can also guarantee to you that a company making billions of dollars a year has no excuse to have shity service like blizzard does especially in a game that's 15 years old has been using servers the entire time yet they still can't get their shit straightened out even 15 years later on a game that's been rehashed from 15 years ago.
---
But yeah you're right.
---
This was your first time getting Jokerd
---
Ha, thankfully I'm level 44 and not 48 so it's all good! 
---
*... Right guys?*
---
Sadly it’s 54+54+1+2+2

Joker didn’t dungeon grind....

Yes, I was just buying up items that were low quantity and posting them again at higher prices. They don't like when you do that for whatever reason.

Remember at the end of that movie Waiting where the dude was bragging about having a job making $50k right out of college. Fucking inflation man.....
---
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD, NICK!
---
That sounds like more player babysitting than I'd want to do, but good on them for providing that level of service.
---
And people were saying you wouldn't see pvp in low level zones.
---
When I first started reading this, I thought it was going to be a variant on the Navy Seal Pasta
---
the same absolutely goes for asmongoloid. i don't watch twitch for so many different reasons but im sure this also applies to a large, very large % of the streamerbase there
---
I'm here from r/all, can someone ELI5 what's going on here?
---
Yeah BRD, Dire Maul, UBRS/LBRS, Sratholme, etc. look at wowhead and find a list of your class/spec pre-BIS dungeon gear and farm those on your way to 60.
---
Okey dokey then. I'm a few years your mind will change.
---
Oh yeah, that MLK guy was an *idiot.* What was he thinking??
---
Method isn't in-game. The only people who's place it is to be involved are the players that were eligible for the staff, and Blizzard, IF there was deception involved in obtaining the item. If there was no deception, then it's up to the server community to blacklist him, as is Blizzard's policy.
---
What server at you on? Maybe we can play together!
---
1/10 for this troll post.
---
Maybe the scumbag can share again for his next toon.
---
I'm just so happy there's going to be a new troll insult copypasta that will be so universal for all genres, not just WOW.
---
Yup, dont care in the slightest..
---
it is your "fault" for rolling on a pvp server.  delete your char and start over on a pve server if you don't like it
---
Wait.. is the patch out!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
---
You are right but that moment when you get there and see this After months of layer was awesome
---
Technically it's a triangular sail on the front of a ship, so it would be the first thing you see if a boat is coming at you.
---
As a saying, it means you have a good initial impression of someone.
---
The patch that added the new T2 models was the one that started the AQ event, but most servers didn't open the gates for a while.
---
Guy probably had a stimulant psychosis after his amphetamine fueled power-levelling session to 60.
---
Let's be honest, after this he is going down in WoW lore. Everyone will remember his name. He will show up in top 10 craziest WoW incidents videos now just for that who the fuck do you think i am comment (even if he's joking)
---
I believe you, I've already (mostly) got my rhythm down farming lumberjacks and zombies in Western Plaguelands. I was making good progress yesterday and actually felt pretty Zen but now I'm assuming Plaguelands are going to be a warzone so I might have to grind out my last 1.5 levels in dungeons.
---
Then GTFO and stop giving them money
---
The diapers are also not designed to contain full on shits either. Adult ones are meant for loads you didn't actually notice you let slip. I believe Adam Savage tested them in a myth for some other reason.
---
I don't know but probably like 20% of the server is alliance so it seems like a waste to throw away a character and get kicked from the guild thats probably 50% of the alliance on the realm. at least I don't feel the 500g he might have made was worth it. It is not that big of a pool of players.
---
Wall of death!
---
The leaf should go to any hunter with the sinew and vice versa.  If no one has the other, then free roll.  You would NEVER give one binding to one person and another binding to another person, so the sinew and leaf is no different.
---
I'm in ya guild, Schala here.  Was funny reading a post and in my head going, that sounds a lot like us.  That sounds exactly like us, who wrote this.. oh.
---
I have zero clue who this player is and what this is about...
---
What the hell...I had 50 min queue trying to log tonight; guess everyone’s on that pvp
---
The most jarring WoW/Hearthstone mismatch is Gadgetzan. In WoW it's a walled desert outpost of the Steamwheedle Cartel, where water is valuable and the most prominent feature is the Thunderdome that takes up most of the center of town. Hostile desert nomads, pirates, and giant bugs are the main dangers. In Hearthstone: Mean Streets of Gadgetzan it's a major city where various factions are engaged in a struggle for control of the city's criminal underworld.
---
Did you submit a ticket? What was their response? What would you like to see done in terms of punishment? Where is the line drawn between pvping in an area and making it a point to kill all enemy factions, and griefing?
---
If you didn't take any action besides post here, and provided no critical thinking or solutions besides "I keep getting killed so now it's a problem, the gms need to do something about ganking", I consider it whining.
---
could you point to a time in wow history where blizzards servers could handle large scale pvp?  if not then why did you expect it here?
---
Just to clarify on this a little:
---
$g is a boolean variable, and not a variable that holds the value of the gender. This is the only way a conditional, ternary statement like this would work.
---
If $g is true, then we know the character is a male, else it's a female.
---
Level 45 here, enjoying the slower journey and also still having a social life(not saying you or anyone higher level doesn't)! Haha
---
Shit man I remember jokerd. Fuck that guy.
---
Also has it really been 11 years? Feels like only a few lol
---
Doomsaw is a good weapon if you get it.  The proc makes it come down to what you want form the weapon.  IBS is a relatively easy quest reward and you can get it as early as 51 I believe.  IBS also adds a bunch of stats to give you about 1% crit and 200 HP and 26 AP.  Is the doomsaw proc more damage than what the IBS add?  Probably.  Health helps a lot in PvP though.  Doomsaw is also another burst/random effect vs more consistency of the IBS.
---
It more comes down to personal preference than one being decisively better than the other.  IBS is also slower and thus has a slightly higher damage range which helps it as well.
---
Hey. This popped up for me too lately. I feel your pain.
---
 I seem to only get it in certain areas, like DM especially, but I can't quite pin down a pattern of occurrence.
---
I've gotten it in Strat too and zoning in/out seems to resolve the issue but its only a matter of time before it happens again.
---

Pretty fricking sweet. Seriously awesome shit. Super cool stuff. Very sick dude. Crazy fucking rekt. 5 mages.  5 evocs? Pretty sick.
---
i lead gdkp runs in cata through firelands but just trash runs for the epic boe's. i invited all the players i knew were decent/broke so that id be able to buy the epic's for super cheap and re-sell. i won the weapons for around 10k gold, and auctioned for 40k. good times
---
See you on the other side brothers and sisters
---
No problem. I think that is the source I used. I used the wowhead data. Probably dated.

Diablo 4 dev team
---
This is why I’m stay clear of towns
---
Thank you.  I love doing this as well.  Took a lvl 21 priest into SM Cathedral and cleared it with them.  They got the healing hammer; won't be able to use it for like 15 levels or something; but they were absolutely running on a high for content that the rest of us found a bit stale.  (Also helped that the low level spiced things up a bit with ass-pulling things we didn't even think about and suddenly had to "handle")
---
We referred to it as "Bait Pulling" an instance.  10/10, would (will) do it again.
---
Just from you guys in the zone or were there more people zoning in?
---
Wait wait! That’s not how it is supposed to be! You should whine to HIM and start dpsing too early ! That’s your privilege as a lady!
---
Our mc clears are around 50-60 minutes and we're not even that quick. The quickest guilds are around 30 min now.
---
Meanwhile some guilds on our server are still over 2 hours
---
I understand that and considering this what you added had nothing to do with the actual point.
---
Give us WSG
---
1-2 hours seems really optimistic for late 30s.
---
\#EndStreamerPrivilege @TipsOut
---
44 is half
---
Found the toxic person
---
PvP has been out for 2 hours. If you go to Hillsbrad or any world boss location there's 100v100+ battles on even smaller realms. Unplayable there too.
---
Nobody cares :)
---
Yeah :D
---
It's also the case that the PTR had the new models and was open for a long time. Lots of players logging in just to see their character updated.
---
You still have a chance though lol
---
But does he leash? 🤔
---
My addon tracked 250 horde and then stopped working
---
The group fanning you were obviously having fun as a group so goal accomplished! Lol
---
DDoS attack my ass. They won't just fucking admit how horrid their server-infrastructure is.
---
Fucking joke of a company.
---
It makes them feel better about themselves to think of us as no lifers, being on welfare, living in moms basement etc. 
---
Most of us are just normal people with normal jobs tho.
---
Sucks to suck
---
I don't play PVP I'm just watching a steam but it's so so bad. Is there really nothing to be done to fix lag in mass pvp events in 2019?
---
As a contrast, almost none of the top recipes can be made for profit on my server right now.
---
No keep 1 layer and enjoy the show 😉
---
Its the since of community/midset held between over 100+ people that makes it awesome. 
---
Why is it awesome when humans in huge numbers put their mind to the same goal? 
---
Example: hong kong protest, sports fans cheering with eachother/ Houston Astros parade where 20 peope helped throw a hat up a parking garage to help someone. 
---
Its a real life spider man meme. When you see someone wearing the same badass shirt you own and that you like and that person holds the same idea as you, its why you go “Hey you too HELL YEAH BUD!”
---
I have 4 toons 20+ but I also have a 60
---
I have all those items, you know the best way to do it? Have an alt becasue you're on a pvp server and it's a 100g respec each time and that's just wasted money.
---

Playing on a laptop without the power plugged in, everything goes to heck, the framerate plummets and it becomes literally unplayable. As soon as I plug it in it is smooth again. Why? I have a relatively new “gaming laptop”. My guess is that the system automatically switches some video card settings or something to save power but how can I override it?
---
I expect a multi billion dollar company to anticipate heavy server loads and upgrade their servers
---
What does ninjad mean
---
All this needs is some gorilla warfare, and this will be a legendary shitpost
---
What is that addon to see the guy casting a spell? ( the shaman casting healing weave )
---
\&gt;bring back layering
---
More like Blizz's servers are trash and they refuse to upgrade them
---
Pretty bad. Trolls can’t even afford shoes
---
now that i think about it, i was one of the first 60s on my server when i hit vanilla so i guess i kinda shot myself in the foot.
---
I'm just responding to the video you posted and said how can this be countered.... You posted a video where they open with cheap shot I told you how to extremely easily counter it.
---
I dunno man, I have 2 60's in at least prebis and I have shit to do all the time. If your only interest is logging in for 2.5 hours of raiding per week, then I don't really care if you stay or go.
---
Out of genuine curiosity, how is one meant to go about splitting up an item drop? Pay them in currency for the value of the drop?
---
It’s not, you’re just lonely.
---
So u gonna take the transfer or what?
---
It's half xp-wise but you also get more xp. So far as time-played I'd guess like 2/3 of the way there?
---
They expected about half if not more would quit after first month
---
Cute :)
---
I think this orc zugged too much zug
---
K. Don't ever play a sandbox mmo, you would hate it.
---
What server?
---
Is this a video or a screenshot?  I bet you're actually sure either.
---
I didn't say that
---
I mean... technically it is the best, and also not the best.
---
First recorded HK today was pretty amazing. 38 warlock walking around desolace. Had just ran through an area so I was low health (about half) and my demon got de-spawned. Lvl 38 warrior was watching me and waited for my back to be turned before charging me. Kept him dot'd and feared till he died.
---
This shit happened all the time back in TBC and classic,  where’s the no changes crowd at now?  Welcome to classic.
---
He abused layering to get more mobs than normal. He'd AoE a bunch of mobs and then switch layers to essentially make everything instantly respawn.
---
Low Warlord
---
Because the logs are of "what **everyone** says/does". If you can't even provide a rough time, you expect them to look through all of their logs to find the relevant ones?
---
Scarlet Key for Strat too
---
Your opinion is in no way childish. Your comment to yesacabbagez was. It's like I'm talking to two different people now.
---
no u
---
Half in terms of what? Overall XP needed to ding 60?
---
you wanted #nochanges....
---
If servers like Nost can have massive pvp battles with no issue and Blizzard can't, that's honestly pathetic
---
Ooo scary a reddit mod lmao
---
When being bullied in real life, the best course of action is usually to remove yourself from the situation. So either leave the zone you are being bullied in, or roll on a different server. It’s unrealistic for you to expect devs to step in and stop a player from playing how they want to play, especially in a 15 year old game hailed for having “no changes”
---
Yeah I'm level 35..
---
Just passing through my all page what does ninjaing it mean? Like he stole it from someone else?
---
Exactly so you haven't actually been feared off a cliff you've just been feared to the edge of the cliff and then fell off when trying to move yourself.
---
\&gt;when pservers have less lag with massive scale pvp
---
not missing much. Everyone is walking in place.
---
I would in fact hate it, as do most people hence the reason they all die within a year.
---
Do they show up when you have the WeakAuras interface open? Also make sure your triggers are set correctly, I find premade WAs sometimes need some fine tuning.
---
I picked up  a poison reminder macro and it had the instant poison reminder set to Instant Poison V instead of Instant Poison VI (or a smart check for any of them) so it wasn't working at first. Had to change the trigger settings.
---
We need BGs or better Servers. This is really no fun with lag like this.
---
*Slow clap for this comment*
---
When tick mining granite is life
---
Damn dude, why you haff to be mad?
---
He aoe leveled.
---
Damn that’s some good drops
---
They're much better now than back then. 80 people going at it used to crash back then. REmember things like the 40 pally v 40 shaman instantly crashing hte servers and such?
---
Beautiful timing!
---
Level 25 here, clawing for the dregs leftover from the rest of you.
---
I think Blizzard are using VMs...they need to put more resources into each server. This is sad.
---
Lag
---
Conversely, when you're a priest and garr dies and melee decide not to care anymore and just get blasted by every add explosion and you're sitting there with barely any mana begging them to just let the ranged finish them off
---
So you're not going to equip Staff of the Shadow Flame?
---
Rogue/shaman/warlock and hunter heavy, surprisingly not too too much druid, and little warrior/priest mage stuff.
---
Again your just wrong in thinking rogues beat SL locks the majority of the time...
---
Just don't french fry when you're supposed to pizza and you'll be fine.
---
yeah we definitely wanted 2004 hardware as a part of our #nochanges campaign
---
Lol it sucks. Did you happen to notice it start happening around a certain level? I can't really remember it happening before probably mid lvl 40's - 50's.
---
Seriously man, when you trying to make a point about 2-3x the server population, don't you think you are making a fool of yourself knowing that CPU and server technology in general developed who knows how much (10-50 fold?)
---
It should have nothing to do with current server pops
---
haHAA
---
What a tool LOL! I’ve never watched his stream before, but was he always this arrogant? I can’t believe someone would non-sarcastically say that  ...this is like the WoW version of the Navy Seal copy pasta.
---
&gt;  Is there really nothing to be done to fix lag in mass pvp events in 2019?
---
A handful of basement russians have proven that it is definitely possible. Small indie company Blizzard just cannot replicate their success, unfortunately.
---
Kromcrush? good times lmfao. 
---
The dude was recruiting the same night it happened because he lost a few players after that ninja but everyone was calling him out on chat. Then he did a MC a day or two after that happened with multiple pugs and it failed miserably after a single boss or two so he lost most of his guild members in the process. All he has left is character transfer to a dead server where he has to name change on top of that.
---
Epic blog post
---
...uh, the honor tab was not in the game until this morning.
---
Some outrageousness is a draw for viewers though. I’ve never watched him, but if he isn’t just out right being a fuck, I would say bad sportsmanship can draw viewers in thanks to the drama.
---
Tanking is way more difficult than dpsing so in a way, you’re going to catch up the skill level soon enough :)
---
Have fun playing the game, you and your husband!
---
Sincerely,
---
Hikilune - Finkle (EU French server)
---
Lol. Great advice!
---
But did they COMPLETELY wipe?
---
Finally someone stepping up to talk about this when no one else will.
---
I can agree with this.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
UO still has private servers up and predated WoW by almost a decade. EVE has been going strong for ages as well. You don't need rewards to PVP. I don't think you have much MMO experience, did you even play wow in vanilla?
---
Wtf, so empty? On Patchwerk-DE there were about 5 horde and 2 ally raids.
---
tldr, I took something i shouldnt have because i think i am more important then others.
---
is there a subreddit for brain dead conspiracy crafters that make the most bullshit conspiracy theories ever heard, cause you should repost this here
---
i think i downloaded it on curse forge
---
Fuck that bellend.
---
You'd have to master loot and let your pugs know that they aren't going to be making any money/drops, might be hard to get pugs that want to do SM with that stipulation though.
---
Personally if I saw someone advertising that I would pass immediately. You would need a pretty sick SM farming comp to justify people coming solely for XP.
---
&gt; The game launched, and had in beta, pvp servers, dueling, pvp flagging etc.
---
But it was still a very small part of the game compared to PvE.
---
That's PVP, blizzard only cracked down on you for same side griefing because there is 100% no way you can combat it. REmember we couldn't have horde chars on the same server.
---
i laughed out loud, thanks bud.
---
Well i suppose u can come up with a function that relates +healing to 5sr and 5sr to regen by extrapolating from existing logs. But personally I'm not up to the task just giving my 5 cents
---
How do you balance looking for a job &amp; fun wow time? I'm in the same situation
---
For what? You can tank pretty much any dungeon as arms no problem. I just dinged 60 yesterday and respecced fury at 58 and still was tanking no problem.
---
A character dying heals the Boss.
---
I would prefer to pay an increased price on all of those things if it meant I could freely change between my specs whenever I'd like.
---
kronos lmao
---
Layering was always meant to be temporary. Are we really trying to rewrite history to make Blizzard look like some kind of victim being strongarmed here?
---
Thanks will try!
---
On average 4 Dark Runes drop per Scholo which is 12g total at ~3g per rune. I frequently whisper groups LF1M healer offering to heal for Dark Runes, I get taken up on it probably 70% of the time.
---
I need no gear from the dungeon, my gear can recover a lot of shitty pulls, farming Demonic Runes as a healer is a hell of a lot slower on a healer than on a dps. I think it's a fair exchange.
---
yes it was Ankh of Life, Though it was a nice trinket, but turns out it triggers GCD, so it's basically worthless
---
Medium in classic is the same population as full back in vanilla
---
“Who do I tink I am!?”
---
if **EVERY LEVEL** took 40 minutes, his time played would be 1 day 16 hours
---
Our guild is pretty casual and we cleared MC &amp; Ony last night in 2.5 hours total. Try hard guilds could do it all in 45 minutes.
---
Indeed, lvl 32  cloth helmet with 15int 12spi from gnomeregan endboss.
---
Has the shown useeffect every 15min, also applys a thorns buff on you for some minutes (doesnt stack with thorns).
---
&gt; Had 5 friends talk me into even playing wow. None of them play anymore.
---
It's a bit weird, like, Classic's good but something just feels off. I've played on private servers for a whole lot longer and enjoyed it. I think a lot of the meta elements around launch has really stained this experience for me, people spamming dungeons, the insane amount of mages, no one on my server really PvPd around launch. Just general community stuff. I haven't clocked out yet entirely, but I can see how some old school players aren't quite feeling it.

He looks and acts like you would expect

at least he's funny, that helps make up for any skill he doesn't have

To get to the heart of your concern, druid tanks are good. You're not running a suboptimal raid by using a druid offtank and its not going to negatively impact your clear times. Given that druids have potentially very good threat it may even speed up your clear times.
---
Work has youtube details and comments blocked. Could only see the video. Thanks for the reply. Again cool vid :)

i said THEY SHOULD DO BETTER, i DONT defend them. But your points are just bullshit.

Respect? Decency? Common courtesy? Not being toxic?

Same. Everytime I brought it up I was met with "LOL YOU DON'T KNOW THAT WILL HAPPEN" smh
---
Man I scrolled down and read some more comments and got it. I didnt really get what was going on watching the clip.
---
It’s actually hilarious that people think that’s serious...
---
Difference is that the Doomsaw is actually available to obtain. IBS when AV comes out will be preferred as like you said, its a quest reward that you just need to win a single game of AV at level 51.
---
no he's not, hes a complete cringelord
---
No, the point is even if you are on the smallest server you cannot have large pvp battles.  20k people makes it more common for large groups to collide, sure. But your dead server still cant handle 200 vs 200 in the open world.
---
Let's see if you can comprehend that
---
Stupid "16 hours ago" fucks this whole image up.
---
Need to snag it again once it shows the date.

its NOT an excuse. THEY SHOULD DO BETTER. Your points are just BULLSHIT.

Have the same problem I play a lot, but Im addicted to level New classes, rogue 41, hunter 45, warlock 45, druid 43, mage 34.  I get bored in the 40s.

---
I can't tell if this is satirical or not.
---
He does, you can tell as soon as he did it he knew it was a shit move. Any time someone tries to justify themselves its a good indicator, everything else on stream is just some front he does. I finally watched the stream last night and people on reddit are seriously over exaggerrating, specially bringing up mental issues. Just another asshole who tried to be cool in front of his "friends" and overstepped. Nothing new.
---
Yes.  The minus is applied after the weekly update.  It’ll calculate what you have earned, then how much you’ve lost, then spit out your honor for the week.
---
no one is saying nightslayer is trash. they’re saying breaking 6pc sc for only one or two pieces isn’t worth it.

I also have it on my stance bar as = so when Im in stealth the button changes to a pickpocket one.
---
What a joke
---
Whitemane is is little horde favored but not too bad. Could always use some more allies.
---
Because EVE and UO have soooo many players compared to wow or FF14. Now you've unironically pulled the "did you even play vanilla" card.
---
Still waiting on a valid argument for how wow is a pvp focused game.
---
Actually genius. Dance, afk/get coffee while still “actively assisting players”
---
They all died and other people are still on the aggro table so he doesn't reset.  That's how every other mob in the game works.
---
What an annoying tool.
---
They just loaded out of the instance and back in?
---
So he can Rp evil in game and on twitch, but you're giving me shit for doing it on the wowclassic subreddit. Your logic is flowed. Anything to be right uh
---
or............they just had a patch planned for later this year and are doing it then, they never said "at the start of phase 2 the key ring will be available"
---
it’s better for pvp but you’ll eventually start using it once you have enough pieces. welcome to vanilla itemization don’t fight it if you want to pump
---
200 vs 200 battles didn’t happen in vanilla, they don’t need to happen now. I understand you want everything you could ever dream of, but the truth is that that doesn’t exist. You will continue to bitch and moan and cry and I will enjoy my time playing classic as it was in vanilla.
---
Yes, my argument is that the up time of kills will be significantly less with people out there ganking.

I showed my SO my new staff: Benediction. after one very unenthusiastic "waw" she went back to watching The Office. :(
---
Streamsniping is such a dumb thing to get mad about in WoW.  It matters in games like mobas ans first person shooters where your location on the map is important, private information.  Not the case in wow.  I understand Wow streamers are frustrated that streaming attracts bad attention with the good, but if you're gonna openly broadcast your location for money you can't complain when people try to take advantage of that.

Considering 1.12 gearing favors Hunters more than anyone else this is surprising. The only thing that should really best you consistantly is shadow priests or maybe shaman burst but that's all classes.
---
god you're dumb
---
New player here. Could you explain the logic. How is it not a rogue item if only a rogue can use it?
---
On my realm it's basically every material there is. It's so hella volatile that everything rises so I'm buying anything that is cheap doesn't matter if it's something as abundant as essence of fire, got 100\~ on AH for 1.20, 3 days later they're at 2.80, Essence of undeath @ 2, suddenly they spike to 4.40. It's so stupid and unpredictable.

There are rogues on the theory crafting rogue discord unironically trying to claim that weapon spec talents aren't that important and you don't need them. Rogues in my guild who sim within 10dps of me can't get within 100 dps of me in raid.
---
It's so frustrating watching people play like garbage in arguably the easiest time in wows history. There's a (slim) chance I might end up on my guilds LC, and gun to my head I couldn't tell you who the second best rogue is out of the 4-5 of them because they're all absolute garbage.
---
Same thing with the warriors in my guild. We have maybe 2 good warriors and after that it's people who can't do 300 dps with tribute buffs.
---
Because EVE and UO have soooo many players compared to wow or FF14. Now you've unironically pulled the "did you even play vanilla" card. Just look how many people you are juggling arguing against, yet none support your postion.
---
So what? did classic just not exist until today where the pvp system was implemented? Sorry EA but "a sense of pride and accomplishment", is not enough to keep a playerbase alive for more than a month.
---
Okay so obviously you dont have any real vanilla experience.
---
Good luck have fun
---
As the Knight Templar from Indiana Jones would say, "choose wisely."
---
There's hundreds of differences between classic and vanilla already. At this point no changes is nothing more than a meme and anyone who parrots this talking point doesn't know what it was for in the first place
---
this sub: but i don’t understand, how is he not super shameful and remorseful and we all know he lost his million dollar contract with method!!!!
---
Nope, I tested it with who was there with me, when you exit the instance by walking out of the dungeon (the only was possible) you walk out normally, and stand there. You do NOT spam jump out of a wall.
---
The use of "salt"/"salty" anymore has been beaten to death.
---
could understand mageblade /s
---
I ask to buy ppl out of certain items and if they aren't cool with that then we just run and roll. A chance at your bis is better than sitting in /4 with your thumb up your ass.
---
This might sound stupid, but the biggest clue is bot-like behavior.  It's all scripted so they can't help themselves but to act according to the script.
---
For example, I noticed one bot would follow you pretty aggressively when engaged in PVP.  I ended up kiting him to a town with guards.  Whenever he'd rez, I would fireblast him and he'd chase me into town again - over and over.  Players don't do this.
---
Also, they move in straight lines, rarely doing anything like jumping, zig-zagging, or whatever.  They also have pauses between combat that are nearly the same.  More complex bots will vary this pause to make it seem more human-like, but the bots I've seen have been the same.

You cant just compare private servers against blizzard servers, all the checks running in the background which are there for a secure and mostly cheat free experience cause this.
---
 Although you might think if pserver people can finance their server through donations blizzard should be able to get servers X times better with the amount of money that is beeing payed for classic, especially when they decide to offer a release phase which only offers wpvp.
---
 I think their codebase isnt built around a playerinteraction of this size, thats why there were instances, layers, shards in the first place so they dont have to worry about this.
---
To each their own...but I'm a mage.

Man this guy memed his way to the top and has only been in Method for like 2 weeks. Not enough time to actually gain anything from them, I bet he doesn't care. If he gets more viewers from this then he gained.

There was a dude on Mal'Ganis called knives who was known for ninjaing shit back in like 2010. A couple years ago during Legion I had a raid decline him an invite because of it.

Unless one is a warlock then level it until you can summon and park him at a world boss/Raid entrance and your guild will love you.
---
All words are made up... we do it when we need to better describe something. Literally the point of language.
---
Yeah he also knows the extra views are temporary hes the living embodiment of the troll mask crying behind it.
---
It's not a good healing spec for raids. It can do the job yes, but moonglow resto is around 50% better for raid healing.

Get all the critical frost talents to boost single target damage, skip winter's chill unless your guild doesn't have anyone else with it. No points in frostbite, shatter, pr cone of cold necessary if you have 150+ spellpower, but max permafrost, improved blizzard, and improved frost nova.
---
Ideally you want 2500hp and 5800+ mana to do it with just blizzard
---
Sometimes a straw is nice, thank you.
---
It depends on the BoE. If it’s an item worth 10g and it’s an upgrade for someone in group im not gonna take it from them.
---
What? He layer hopped the last 20 levels literally every pull, he will be no where near as fast with no layers, tons of competition, and actual 60s to kill him lol . Having gear makes almost no difference, spell power doesn't translate to Blizzard like it does for frostbolt.
---
Getting a lot of Athene vibes
---
Its called inflation.  
---
And yes you are correct, in real life it does not just increase flat living cost.  It also causes businesses to fire employees or to outright close down because goods acceptance doesn't inflate as fast as the turn around on wages, thus more money out of pocket and higher cost goods driving sales down.  Price hikes cascade as books balance behind it.  So any sub 5% net company either struggles horrendously or just outright collapses before balance is restored.  Considering about 50-60% of companies run at about the 5% net gains average FY... you can see how this causes issues.   
---
The same problems exist with the in game economy, this one is different than your example though.  Once an outgoing cost is cut, more money lands in pockets, consumption goes up (demand) and prices follow suit with the same static supply being unable to saturate the new influx of consumers.
---
Ya something good for the game but we agree the balance is terrible. See agreement is good!
---
Man up, kid

No it doesn't.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

I think I quit a few months ago at about 52.  Good to know not to come back.

They also spawned all bosses on every server at the same time.

Ive been using a cat ever since I got a hunter pet, however, I was reading a bit and it seems like the Owl might be better for PVE? I'm on a PVE server. However, i was wondering if I change pets do I have to start all the way over with them. Do I have to redo all the beast training and how will I get all the points I need for that? Also if say I tamed a lvl 15 pet at lvl 31 do I have to level it up to 31 before its actually useful? I'm just very unsure of the pet mechanics. 
---
"sponsor" implies he was getting paid, which is unlikely.
---
Just fought a battle this size on Sulfuras and there was no lag at all.
---
The screenshot is the best part... There were too many peole, server didnt handle it, it was lagging and boring...
---
That was meant to be more tongue in cheek about the stereotypes of the people our age. I don't care what people do as long as they don't start telling me, "Oh you have to watch this one guy tho cause......." 
---
Personally for me I don't watch them because its not enjoyable at all, spectating and or living vicariously doesn't work for me.. I can't invest myself in others actions or successes. I put thousands of hours into DotA but I couldn't care less about watching the tournaments or what team was beating who.
---
ha. escort quests are going to be a real bitch for the next few days.

My faction is outnumbered 4:1. So why are we having to sit in queue? Why are we being told to migrate elsewhere when we're outnumbered 4:1?

Also healers. Large scale fights heavily rely on having healers that can sustain them.

they dont really want classic,  they want to push people back onto retail.  They are hoping classic is the gateway drug to get people hooked again

And I'll continue to kill hunters.

What did you expect? Phase 2 just dropped. Get over yourself.

I never see this, and im pretty active on my server... people are specced specifically for one task and just end up using it for everything so they dont pay gold to change.
---
I am well aware of the purpose of Reddit, thank you. My reason for appearing to you bent out of shape is that conjecture, conspiracy and just plain make believe are not my ideas of fruitful discussion. I honestly do not care what these guys think Blizzard's intentions are and have no desire to discuss further than what I posted leaving OP to form his own conclusions, move on and go back to enjoying the game.
---
Yet that doesn't seem to be allowed to happen. Might make me think again about posting in a sub with so much cognitive dissonance and so many peddlers of anti-Blizz propaganda.
---
Again I say I'm just a regular guy who answered a post and woke up to this nonsense. 
---
For those that want to continue the discussion, of course you are free to do so. I respectfully ask that you do not reply directly to me but to any of the other posters who actually do want that conversation.
---
do you people just like, not have a sense of humor or purposefully refuse to acknowledge guys like him or asmon are joking around

On my mark...  UNLEASH HELL!
---
They have provided a solution, free server transfers. You don't get this crazy level of lag on the low pop servers.
---
The problem is people all want to play on the super high pop servers. Even if they improved servers, more people would just pile in until its unbearably laggy again.

he's shown a clip of him playing as an undead shadow priest back in original vanilla with the same name. so that narrows it down a bit. there's lots of players named advertise but a lot less that are the same name/race/spec and both avid pvpers.

That was the point of using layering at first, we just blew away their expectations. Im sure blizzard didn't actually expect all these zoomers to stay on the over populated servers and continue to complain about them with free transfers being a thing.

Ask yourself is it really worth being able to type something and see it come up on some random persons stream?

Try not to roll horde scum and then you can deal with the undead rogue gank squads instead
---
The average player reaches level 60 in 10 days played time. A moderately good to great player will typically reach 60 in less than 10 days. Somewhere between 6-9 days played is pretty reasonable for most veterans of the game who are not "speed runners" but still trying to hit 60 in a reasonable time.
---
I'm not being mean here, but you are literally below average in terms of leveling speed of more 'standard' players.
---
But since you asked
---
1) Do not spend time sitting in Capital cities socializing. Join a guild, socialize via guild chat. People waste a ton of time sitting around at Inns and Capitals. You can talk while you're out killing yellow mobs who give good XP.
---
2) Skip or return to tedious or hard quests that you cannot complete, always complete quests that are doable for your level and never spend extra hours trying to hammer out a quest little by little. It's much better to level up elsewhere and come back when the quest is reasonably doable than try and just "get it done".
---
3) Spend as little time as possible in Capital cities and have a bank alt. This means when you have anything you aren't going to vendor but want to put in the bank, you mail that stuff to a bank alt to avoid having to make the long run/fly back to a Capital city just go head to the bank. Selling stuff on the AH? Need to check AH prices? Trying to make sales in trade chat? Bank alt, bank alt, bank alt. Mine never leaves Iron Forge and has sold tons of stuff, checks prices for me, and has a large cache of my gold on him in case I need to buy something.
---
4) Do dungeons. Questing can be better XP when it's done efficiently. The vast majority of players (myself included) do not quest efficiently. Sometimes you accidentally complete a quest in an area that you could have had another quest for but didn't. Some quests line up perfectly and if you do them out of order you end up running back to the same spot several times which takes time because travel before level 40 is slow as fuck. Dungeons are generally worse gold but better XP.
---
5) Use a quest add-on or quest guide, but be aware doing dungeons around your level is still probably gonna be faster. Quest guides try to give you an exact path of the fastest and most efficient level so you don't end up doing the same area for different quests over and over. But these quests guides don't account for the fact that maybe you end up going somewhere that is highly contested or has a ton of people at that time taking up all the spawn kills. Leveling speed while questing can easily drop off in speed if something like this happens.
---
6) Make friends with roles you don't fill. If you're a healer, make a tank friend. If you're a tank, make healer friends. If you're a DPS... make friends with everyone because you'll have the hardest time finding dungeons.
---
7) Kill most mobs along the way to your destination. This stops applying as much once you hit level 40, but still a good rule of thumb.
---
8) Always log off at an Inn or a place where you'll get rested XP, no matter how sleep you are.
---
9) Have a plan. You don't need Questie or a guide even though they help. But before you log in, plan out your day. Know you're going to knock out a few Duskwood quests, then head to SM for the rest of the night.

I don’t mean to beat a dead horse but for starters, stop throwing your money at them hoping they will do anything different. They had the highest sub numbers for years thanks to classic, they got our money and are not fixing anything, are we going to just keep giving it to them? I’d love to play but until they fix this hot mess I refuse. As long as everyone is still playing they have no incentive to fix it.

&gt;How does EVE online do it?
---
By having a 0.1 Hz tick rate in the largest battles (yes, that is one tick every ten seconds).Unless you can give people a reason to sit through what's effectively a several hour long slideshow in order to pvp in the largest battles, then trying to copy the scale of Eve is pointless, because Eve relies on Tidi slowing the server ticks to that level to handle the large battles.

uh did you play nost.  it had lag.  theres like hundreds and hundreds of people in a single zone fighting its going to lag.

I’ve heard questie might cause this bug, worth checking into

Stop questing and start farming pre-bis. Dungeons is gonna be the most effective way of leveling for a few weeks now untill BGs arrive.
---
It was the last thing the server could handle and that’s wonderful to me
---
It’s all about the moment
---
That was Vanilla, this is Classic.
---
Interesting question. Though I don’t think the 20 damage would be worth swapping
---
Blizzard needs more money for better servers /s

No.

Yeah it's not like we literally pay monthly for server costs.

Wouldn’t be surprised if a mass group of people or a few guilds enabled pvp for this event and then they normally turn it off otherwise
---
I am now! :)
---
i hope anyone who defends blizzards servers falls and caves their skulls in
---
Yes, you have to flag yourself to do so though. Think how faction specific zones work on PvP servers. One side has to flag or take hostile action to get flagged. Now apply that to both factions for all zones.
---
Rolling need on a BoE isn't ninja looting.
---
Lights Hope is always camped by alli anyway, and constantly kill horde flying in and landing even before honor.
---
People hate on rogues because they aren't rogues.
---
It varies by class, some classes just don't have reasonable hybrid specs. But for example on warlock you have stuff like https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/3500200512201135--50500051220001
---
Nobody would run that with dual spec, they'd just be DS/Ruin for PvE and SL for PvP.
---
so its estimating too low for ppl who play normal sized groups, and too high for ppl in 40man raids :D what a coincidence
---
Me and me friends were going to play on Thalnos. We thought that the Brazilian thing was probably overblown and would be better than getting stuck on a streamer server.
---
We couldn't actually get in on launch day and went to Kromcrush instead.  That was a good choice it sounds like.
---
I was getting between 1 and 8 earlier in a full 40 man  
---
Biggest chunks go to those that actually deal the damage, those who just get leech kills barely get any.
---
As a lock i like having a shadow priest in the raid for shadow weaving
---
Best news I'll hear all day.
---
Nice... Got nothing to worry about, just hit 39!
---
Guess I'll be farming dungeons instead of questing in Vietnam
---
Oh I'm not talking about ping, I'm talking about language and cultural similarities; people tend to stick by the people they know the most. But that's fair that he is on an NA server because of streaming, as most of the streamers are from the Americas. Thanks for clarifying.

Can I ask what you mean by upgrade the server. What do you think that entails? Let's install some more RAM!!!!
---
Its actually a 2min long video
---
Huh. Maybe that's why retail is stagnant, they haven't had any patches either. Actually I think the last patch Blizzard as a whole has released was the one where they killed Heroes of the Storm.
---
pvp on a 4:1 pvp server is real fun!
---
wont it also work for the main hand weapon while dual wielding?
---
What’s this one in reference to?
---
Asmon on suicide watch on stream atm, rofl
---
9:36pm eu Primordial Flame - Dragonfang EU
---
Exactly
---
&gt;It's insane how all these people have returned to classic are all saying "Why PVP no work" when everyone who's been playing retail for almost 8 years now has experienced this.
---
It's insane how people who haven't played retail don't understand a retail problem?
---
^(Hell yeah it's great. I justify the price by the amount of effort this guy put into make it. He only added a price to it because of medical bills he had. Other sites ripped off a lot of his guide too.)
---
would be nice is there was an option to toggle.  but oh well.
---
The classic grind affects everyone differently
---
I love this, because it's a perfect example of someone getting an inflated ego and thinking they're untouchable, only to get their ass handed to them for being an utter douchebag. 
---
This idiot just derailed (or at the very least severely damaged) his prospective gaming career, mere weeks after launching it. What an absolute bell-end.
---
So if Im DWing an axe in the main hand and a sword in the OH, do I need 6 or 9 for my abilites to never miss?
---
also, do I need 6 or 9 for my MH axe to never miss? im an orc btw
---
This happened on Pagle in my guild &lt;Risk&gt;
---
As many as you feel comfortable with.
---
Damn, that guy seriously played way too much WoW in the last few month!
---
-said no one
---
And neither of them are gods, and what's more impressive depends on who you ask.. That's all I'm saying.
---
You can compare them.
---
I'm sure others will know more than me, but you need to train your pet. Once you buy the skills from the pet trainer, you then have to go to slingshot button and use your pet's point to train the ability.
---
Everything I've read has said cat or owl. I'm a level 40 dwarf hunter and have been using the same cat I tamed when I first could and I've had no issues with Cat.
---
And cleave at least warriors.
---
Had a fun raids  now with 40 people inside Ogrimar until we got 1 DHK and everyone left. There goes city raids.
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
This isn'te ven close to he best caster drop from the phase.
---
You actually get ranked based on how much you participated in each kill and each subsequent kill of that player slowly rewards less honor so repeat killing someone has diminishing returns.
---
In a small group you're likely focusing kills bit by bit, as a raid group you're just mobbing people down and slewing them left and right and likely not getting nearly as much participation points as you think you are because a lot of the other raiders are doing the bulk of the work.
---
If you're not an AOE character it's gonna be rough.
---
How can we get activision-blizzard to decrease the latency of playing on the wow classic servers?  Right now, the servers are lagging balls and the game is unacceptable.  How can they fix the problems that they knew were going to happen?
---
Server capacity and overall population should never be an issue. That's the entire reason the queue exists, to accommodate the overflow that the server can't handle. Server population - Server Capacity = Queue. 
---
Any system that is designed to fail when used within its own limits is an incredibly flawed system.
---
"but with also a good Alliance ratio"
---
Meh being over leveled for a zone in classic is definitely not a bad thing. Unless you're leveling a hunter or something where solo killing is easy.
---
thats the joke....
---
I'm not advocating anything he's done; it was obviously all wrong, and his punishment thus far has been deserved...but this guy is obviously going through some pretty serious mental health issues, publicly. Let's all just try to keep that in mind.
---
I was an idiot and removed my disguise after starting the escort. And honestly, it was super easy (As a caster class). Just follow behind him at a good distance, keep an eye on any wandering elites, and watch him wreck everything. I even spent some time smiting some of the mobs to make it go faster. As long as you target the enemy he's killing and don't pull aggro, it's a piece of cake.
---
Meh level 58 grinding satyr in Azshara for Mongoose elixir recipe and I killed a 60 warlock 3 times. I'm ready boys! 🤘
---
Yep I'm lvl 55 too. Can't find anyone wanting to run brd. Questing is shit atm. Dunno what to do.
---
Not saying you can't like retail, I'm definitely playing Shadowlands when it comes out. But for someone that never played the game before to pre-order the latest announced expansion that we don't know a lot about...
---
Arent the onyxia weapons just incredibly low drop rate? I thought that was to be expected.
---
There was DDOS going on today
---
Why are you commenting
---
Username checks out.
---
Idk about op but for me it’s the lack of ability to get distance and getting deadzoned. I’m bm/mm rn and will probably switch to mm/survival with p2 out now but I essentially have 1 way to get distance and that’s by using scatter shot into a freezing trap. If i get that off I do alright but if it’s a gnome or a mage I’m pretty fucked. And wpvp is difficult bc if you’re not the one doing the one initiating I don’t have the preferred distance for fights. 
---
Just my 2 cents. I could use some practice in wpvp that’s for sure

Now imagine the outrage if 50k mouth breathers couldn’t suck Amons dick and roll on his server. Blizzard can’t win.

Apples and oranges. I wish people stopped saying such stupid things..

I'm wondering if you're alliance? He made it for horde to begin with so maybe some things were outdated on the alliance side at launch. Not horde though.

Blah blah blah

Inc 10 second cast delay

It’s dropped 4 out of the last 6 weeks for my guild, the other 2 weeks were mageblades.

Its pretty impressive to be the best at leveling, say what you will about him. I agree with all of it but its pretty impressive lol.

im better than all of you feggets

Just upgrade the servers bro! It's that simple! Even a monkey could figure it out!

The census add-on has been fixed so that you can use it to learn about your own faction on your own server. But the central site doesn't seem to be being maintained (??? - I could be wrong)

**Definition of sarcasm**
---
1: a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain
---
2a: a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter, caustic, and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual
---
b: the use or language of sarcasm
---
That's not really a question...
---
The best way for you to figure out what you're "getting into" is to pay $15 for a month resub, and play classic for a month. You're not committing to a huge amount of money or a new expansion, just $15.
---
Can always count on dextero to miss the joke/sarcasm by a mile.
---
I am only 53 but I respec'd to 40 in prot last night with 11 in arms for anger management and 2 couple in fury for crit. The difference I experienced in BRD was incredibly noticeable, getting rage every time I blocked, the additional armor, additional rage, etc
---
It may not be "needed" but the experience of tanking whilst prot spec is amazing
---
Except on a lot of details, it was a completely different game. You did know that before you repeated what so many other uninformed people are saying, right?
---
He's still immensely popular and his fan base is totally loyal to him. Like, chat was encouraging him to ninja the item. They recognize and love that he's a troll. The people who're saying "I'm never going to watch him" was never going to watch him regardless, meanwhile his fan base loves him even more. He was at 300 viewers yesterday, but today it was 3k.
---
This is a net gain for him.
---
lol! I like how you snuck that one in there.

 Can someone shed some light on how DKs work in the first week? To my understanding DKs are supposed to have an direct impact on your rating, but wont be considered when calculating your weekly rating and rank. so DKs dont really matter in the first week?
---
That post was about private servers vs classic. It's not really a secret that Blizzard switched from dedicated hardware in vanilla to cloud servers in classic.   
---
Advancing security and auth isn't the reason the servers didn't scale with the last 13 year's worth of hardware, costs and flexibility are.  
---
Which is fine, but don't offer a service that's beyond the server's capabilities.
---
&gt;There is a very vocal minority
---
How the populations of _the largest servers_ are a vocal minority is beyond me.
---
&gt;It's like they expect blizzard to add more tables  
---
Like expecting the table to not suddenly collapse after waiting for a seat to free up?
---
Lol, this comment from 2005 clearly disagrees with you
---
From AllakhazamBy TheWoody [on 2005/03/27](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18541/puissant-cape#comments:id=3066667) (Patch 1.3.1)
---
Subject: "only 5% drop?"
---
dont know how its only 5% drop &gt;.&gt; the one time it was killed on uther it droped 2 of them lol
---
Honestly his manager might have been his manager assigned to him by Method. Which might mean that manager is also no longer repping the fool. How they said it could still apply that way.
---
I think the set-up went a little long, but nice pay-off at the end.
---
Solo Maraudon, don't need to respec as Priests can do it as Holy or Disc spec.
---
What I do is start at Orange entrance and walk past all the mobs, this nets me 3x Ghost Mushroom for ~5 minutes of walking. If I take the tunnel into Inner Mara instead of jumping down into the pond, I can check three possible spawns for one of the two Ghost Mushrooms available in Inner Mara, this consistently nets 5x Ghost Mushrooms per Mara run. There's also a decent amount of Blindweed nodes.
---
Tinkerer takes about 1.5-2 minutes to kill as healer spec, keep SW:P + Renew up while wanding from outside Dragon Breath range. The item he drops that is worth the least is the shield, which still vendors for 2.26g. The sword vendors for 3.21g.
---
Princess takes about 4-6 minutes, depending on how much +Spell/Shadow you have equipped. Just keeps SW:P and run along the walls of her area in a big circle. Sometimes she will catch you and Windfury for half your health. Just PW:S before she does and use Renew while running, no need to stop to heal yourself. Having Minor Speed boot enchant is highly recommended. Her mace vendors for 4.48g and her dagger vendors for 3.54g. None of her BoP drops vendor for less than 1.02g and she will always either drop two blues or a blue + BoE green.
---
If you go through Scepter portal straight to Inner Mara, you can finish a run in 12~15 minutes and logout reset while still getting 1-2x Ghost Mushrooms per run. You do not need good gear to do this solo as there is a video of a priest doing this without gear equipped (albeit he was Shadow spec).
---
&gt;We knew this would happen a year in advance. 
---
nah, you had a bunch of people, almost half this sub tell us "bliZard kNowS what They'rE doINg" 
---
funny how it's the same people who'll go "well yup, you said #nochanges, blame yourself" 
---
fucking lol
---
I’m not wrong. I’m also in the speedrunner community. I was there watching when he started chumming layers. He was doing that for nearly three full levels to expedite respawns in his chosen area. Horde ganking had nothing to do with it - he layer swapped to leave them earlier than the last push.
---
LOCAL IDIOT DOUBLES DOWN ON MISTAKE.
---
What a moron, but really who watches idiots like him I wilk never get it.
---
Do you realize how much publicity he's gotten from doing this? You guys are only helping him. I didn't even know who he was before this and now I want to check out his content to see what it's all about. You're a bunch of idiots.
---
But you wouldn't have been world first. So what's your point?
---
I'm busy. I get to play 1 day a week and I don't want to lose that one day to some asshat who decided he is going to gank and entire zone.
---
It's NA :(
---
damn not sure actually. would u be able to type it out? :D
---
Boy you really are upset arent you...
---
A 7 year old game that went through sustained maintenance and feature upgrades.  
---
Should we also expect planes to fall out of the sky ? Cars to stop working ? How about radio signal and devices ?  
---
The old code excuse is a blanket statement for people not familiar with software engineering.
---
...And? Are you saying that you can only use an area with a single distinct government to describe where things are located? The New England Patriots will be very sad.
---
They care to squeeze out as much money as possible from it, yes.
---
Where is he defending them? He literally says "YES, a multimillion dollar company SHOULD do better" 
---
He's saying the comparison to pservers isn't a good argument, because it isn't. That doesn't mean he thinks Blizzard is doing a great job.
---
Then just run your friend through with loot set to FFA?
---
You know what else is ridiculous, people who can't read the Breaking News message in the launcher stating that they're experiencing DDoS attacks.
---
No they are cheaping out, that is actually what is happening. If subs are around 5 million then with $15 a month that's $75,000,000.
---
The classic team is abhorrently small so they aren't paying too much out of that for labor, servers are cheap and have been for over a decade. There is literally no logistical excuse for having none of this sorted before p2, it's just them being cheap and knowing people still are going to pay $15 a month either way.
---
It's fucking lazy, despite what you want to believe the servers didn't actually lag even nearly this hard in 05. They sure sucked but the fact that they lagged less back then compared to now? It's been 14 years since 05. It doesn't matter if it's "security", it doesn't matter why the fuck it's happening cause clearly they know so stop speculating on why servers are lagging.
---
What matters is that it's happening and they did nothing (while knowing about the lag months in advance) and still have done nothing to this day, screams incompetency.
---
It isnt.
---
Is there an addon that will track what items I've got across multiple characters as well as where they are (bag/bank/mail)? I know TSM does this but I'm hoping for something a bit less expansive.
---
Okay then let's consider the situation from a group perspective. All of them experience the same queues, all of them have the same choice. Migrate or migraine. Now we're accounting for those who have friends, does this satisfy you?
---
How are sports a microcosm and what of? Why are they a huge part of some cultures? Please fill me in, google isnt helping: every answer could easily be applied to MMOs.
---
&gt; People like sports because it's aesthetically pleasing. People like sports because, like the theater, it is a venue for emotional expression. People like sports because they need an escape from real-world troubles. People like sports because it provides a sense of belonging, a connection to a wider world.
---
&gt; Sports draw us in for many reasons, the elegance, the competition, the history, our identification with great athleticism (we may not be able to do it, but they sure can!), a coming together of community in a shared story etc. In a world that is losing its legitimacy; professional sports are essentially sane and fair.
---
Seems like if MMOs had been around since day 1 like sports they'd be taken much more seriously.
---
I really wasn’t prepared for the wholesome bits

I just rerolled horde here.  Heard good things.  Have a 55 on Kromcrush.

I think that poor girl is the one takin gthe screenshot and is trying to point out the scrub on the roof safespotting.
---
Isn’t shaman a hard counter to mage though? Also gear is a very big component. Some 60s will be much harder to kill than others.
---
i disagree, we should only HS when rage capped and by weaving it into our other abilities to get more from the auto
---
Any sizable server had many more than two layers for the first several weeks of Classic
---
NOTHING!!! NOTHINGGGG
---
I would recommend using bartender4,you can place the bars wherever you want and change their size.
---
I really want to report this comment, just because I can feel this is actually what goes through your mind :(
---
Ya it went through all those upgrades that ended up being bfa. The whole point was the original experience....this is the original experience lmao.
---
Wondering this too after getting the smart idea to join a raid at hillsbrad getting 2 dhks in a minute, does this fuck me over and when will be able to see the amount of honor we got?
---
Oh perfect.  Thanks.
---
That was my point? I would join another run on the smallest chance it does drop, I wouldn't want it automatically going to someone else. It's literally a free 900g~
---
one population (community) per (one) server.
---
(each server had it's own community, as a closed system)
---
You don't have to buy your epic mount?
---
Stop polluting this subreddit with this streamer drama shit.
---
your spells actually go off? XD
---
not here they dont
---
Lemme guess, your uncle is a GM ;)
---
That a classic experience you have right there, the true experience to kill a raid boss is to kill it before some other group can get to it.
---
Apparently some douchebag on a ss I posted earlier said "no one says this" except they do repeatedly.
---
Looks like Windseeker that I took my ss on.  If so, for those saying it looks small, it's a moderate sized server.
---
lol what a pathetic excuse.. "ddos" attacks
---
If you're a hunter as your flair suggests: just finish all the quests you can in EPL, WPL, WS, and Felwood (and if you haven't already, Ungoro). A lot of the quests will require groups (especially in the plaguelands) but some of them lead into other quests which you can solo.  Once you get all that stuff done just try your hardest to get into any dungeon runs when you can and try to finish any of the dungeon quests you can in the process.
---
In the midst of all this, unfortunately you will have to end up grinding mobs. Best advice I can give here is farm Timbermaw rep or Argent Dawn rep. Once you're 57-58 or so you can farm the 'gargantuan/monstrous bats'(or whatever they're called) in EPL for some good xp. They're quite easy to kill--especially as a hunter, and they're in a fairly safe location as far as competition/ganking goes.
---
Actions have consequences dude. You can't separate shit like that. Method is a business, they care about their name and if they damage their brand, sponsors might drop them, meaning they lose MONEY. 
---
I'll put it another way: If you're an employee of some company, and you say racist shit on Facebook, if you live in the west, you're probably getting *fired*, and when you tell them "But it was between me and the guy I called a N-word! And maybe Facebook, but not you!!"  that shit WILL NOT FLY. You're getting the boot. 
---
It's not even about the staff, it's about the **behaviour of one of Method's representatives**, because his behavior does not fit with their values, he is no longer allowed to represent them. Period. 
---
I don't know if you're a fan of his or what, this is like really basic stuff.
---
Stop giving them money, only thing they understand
---
The guy behind him was Leshraque, who was the first unassisted to 60. None of us really slept to 60, I think Lesh slept 8 hours and I slept for 16 hours. Every other speedrunner I knew elected to solo run unassisted and without chumming layers.
---
Everyone knows Joker was world first. We’re not pretending though that it was unassisted or that he didn’t abuse layering for the last few levels.
---
Not sure why people get so precious about this as speedrunning has plenty of variants.
---
#nonechangingbutsome
---
Huh?
---
I'm not a Blizzard apologist, and I've seen plenty of lines of code in my life. Maybe next time you should actually read what you're copying before you change it, trying to be funny.
---
that's not a solution, lmao. if a server had literally nobody on it but 4 guilds, and those 4 guilds decided to world pvp the server would still shit itself.
---
Faction specific queues would make way too much sense.
---
It's simply odd to refer to such a small area of an already small country. It would be more like referring to a small area within California, instead of just saying California.
---
Dang, this is the sauce. I will be trying this if I am ever able to log in again hahah thanks for taking the time.
---
Not in classic though, how I wish locks had UA...
---
You can absolutely be a badass druid tank and fit into a highly competitive guild. I've been playing this game for 5 years and put tons of effort into very competitive speedruns for my guild so here is the deal:
---
- First off, you're gonna have to invest a lot of time outside the raid itself for this to work on a high level. Not only consumables and worldbuffs like everyone else, you're also gonna need to farm pummelers: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler
---
So, you might be spending up to a couple of hours in gnomergan for every tryhard raid, the more the merrier.
---
- I don't think the warrior vs druid tank debate is the biggest obstacle, theoretically if you had 2 players of completely equal skill to pick between yes you do go with the warrior, but in practice this won't ever be the case.
---
How you generally prioritize raidspots is: raidperformace &gt; preparation &gt; class &gt; gear
---
What I mean by this is you can absolutely blow out every other warrior out of the water if you prepare and perform exceptionally well. The tankspot you're probably gonna get is offtank, just because main tank in every guild is 99% gonna be a warrior (even tho druid can do really well as main tank, thers even a couple of specific fights where bear is superior threat and should be swapped in as MT), as for 3rd tank, warrior is just outright superior, its a very supportive role.
---
- One more thing: Learning curve in vanilla is quite steep and its a game about knowledge more than anything else, the learning period might take time especially since you're tackling a more niche role - which is something where knowing as much as possible about on how to push the limit of your class is gonna be key. You're gonna have to be really really convincing. When talking to a top level guild you should pretty much be the most insightful druid tank they've ever talked to. Even top guilds WILL NOT KNOW what a druid is REALLY CAPABLE OF. So in that sense getting a raidspot may present a challenge, even though taking a sick druid tank is a big big improvement over a mediocre warrior.
---
PS. I'm not playing classic so I'm not aware about some specifics that could compromise druid's viability, but from what I've observed the parry haste mechanic might be dangerous and cause some deaths cuz of high burst damage. On the other hand bosses don't hit hard in classic so that makes druid much more viable, having to take extremely hard hits was probably druid's biggest weakness.
---
lmfao

I'll be punishing myself more than them. I love this shitty game.

Its insane people cant think outside their own experiences for fucking second.

Of course this shit surprised me, I haven't played retail since early Cata.

This is a ridiculous necro from a google search, but 8k? 
---
Assuming CoS you need a noncrit to be hitting for ~3640. Base is 500 so you need 3140/0.83 spellpower....~3800 spellpower. You're only getting a bit over 400 from trinket and cosumables. So you're saying you had 3400 spellpower on gear. What.
---
I’m on a low/med pop server. We had some latency and DC issues assuming from DDOS announcement but no lag! Had at least 120 players per side duking it out over the world bosses. It was so fun
---
Medium pop servers are bigger than original vanilla full servers. I can't comment on low but on a medium I've had no issues finding instances (aside from at like 2am/6am in the morning might be quiet) at all levels and get a similar experience to what OP has described.
---
But this is stupid... so if say horde is contesting it and win the tag all other horde guilds need to back off?
---
Dude just put the world boss in an instance so these people stop crying. In my eyes world bosses were always a form of free for all.
---
Of course there are people there. We're not even a low pop server, we're medium. There probably aren't 600 players in the zone no, but multiple raid groups for each faction. Certainly enough to match the number of players shown in this image.
---
Hell, on the first day of the launch there were several times as many players in the valley of honor and while they weren't all spamming AoE's the game performed fine.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first Sandwich Artist in all of fucking Subway. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random sandwich artist? You think I'm a fucking random sandwich artist? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who toasted 350 fucking thousand subs with pepper jack cheese. Me, not you. The most subs toasted ever. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
bwahahaha
---
I’m going to actively push the narrative that he cheated to hit 60 first
---
Uh. What mistake?
---
Put it into context:
---
There were no upvotes, no downvotes, no other comments or replies. Contextually, there was no way to know if they were serious or facetious, and I wasn't replied to by them until after the fact.
---
I have yet to actually make a mistake, but all you dinguses want to "whoosh" because you think it makes you look funny or superior? Alright. Go right ahead and whoosh, you just look like idiots following an internet trend to me.
---
Because the ticket system is a far cry from what it once was in vanilla.
---
A herb baked egg all day every day
---
Had a bad day?
---
A little late to the Party dont you think?
---
You can't tell, but they actually started moving towards each other 15 minutes ago.
---
I think my game is broke the screen seems to be permanently greyish for some reason
---
R/arethestraightsok
---
Isn't it crazy to watch someone you know turn into that? I don't want to say I'm better than those people, but I am definitely more well rounded. I listen to other people's ideas and criticism. It actually keeps me up at night that there are people out there who are so wrong, but are so convinced that they are right and smarter than everyone else. There truly is no getting through to people like that and it makes me lose hope in humanity and education.
---
You're delusional and just want to complain. Either way your post was put in the trash.

Im talking about the mageblade..

Ok boomer. you still make stale sexist jokes.

KRUMP DA PURPLE ONES DA HARDEST
---
Dunno who you're talking about. As far as I'm concerned, there was no world first 60. It was a dead-on tie between like 50 people.
---
Making me kind of wistful for the long-winded and biting Tseric posts.
---
Might as well delete your char and start over
---
They probably did MC after BWL as they would only need buffs for their progression raid.
---
I usually have a bag full of mats already and on the realm I'm on the mat prices fluctuate a lot.
---
Is it sad that I wish I didn’t go to Cancun (destination wedding) for 4 days just so I could hit 60 before phase 2? 
---
Currently level 58 and a half...
---
Are you in the guild &lt;Booty Bay Bandits&gt; ??
---
He should have just recast seduce.
---
I would definitely get the helm. It was cheaper for me to buy the mats then tip a LW to make it.
---
If you want dungeon healing gear, the Dreamweave items are a pretty good start. Again it was cheaper for me to buy the mats and get a tailor to make. 
---
Living Shoulders are BiS for resto, and isn't too expensive to get the mats. Finding an Ele Leatherworker was the hardest part.
---
You realize the comment you replied to is talking about the staff then right...?
---
A 55 orc warrior just trying to quest
---
I would advise deleting your character and rerolling...
---
In all seriousness it's probably not that big of a deal. Just try and avoid DKs moving forward and you'll be fine.
---
Because they are German and speak German as a first language i imagine.
---
It’s not a hard counter, but mage is certainly an underdog, but 9 levels and level 60 gear closes that gap really fast. 
---
The point I’m making is you can still hold your own.
---
Same. Reservation attempts are an immediate kick or leave from me.
---
Without achievements system literally anyone could claim they were first. What does it matter?
---
T2 update was announced at bliZzcon I think.
---
This is Jokerd's reaction when he ninja'd the item and people called him out on his stream.
---
If you got DKs from low level players it would open a huge way to grief
---
Pre-Phase 2 logic:
---
&gt;We will see an increase in ganking but it’s not like their will be roaming death squads hunting down players.
---
Current situation:
---
&gt;roaming death squads everywhere
---
Because if no one buys subs, streamers wouldn't be able to produce their content, and you wouldn't be able to watch at all. Let alone for free. 
---
If there's not a good way to monetize it, you can't do it for a living. It's the same reason you'd donate to a patreon, because you like what that person does and want them to be able to continue.
---
Will fail and you will be auto attacked out of stealth only to have the entire opposite faction pummel you.
---
No keychain
---
And he didn't grief other players as far as i remember. Even when he was in his persona mode he just wanted to "pwn some noobz in pvp".
---

Asmongold has viewers because he is entertaining to watch his stream has only grown since he stopped mythic raiding and the streaming of it.

cant be true. That doesn't support r/wow's narrative
---
So you have citation for no future impact? I cannot find anything that specifies it.
---
I'm in a pug raid group and some asshole went rogue and started killing civilians while laughing
---
As a former Skeram Alliance: fuck off. No one wants to be camped by a 40 man raid for daring to attempt to run anything inside BRM. There is literally nothing an individual player can do against 40:1 odds. You're not "brave" for putting up with it, you're dumb.
---
You're good, its % based and since its week 1 its not taking really anything away
---
No ides
---
Welcome to the real world
---
Yes. I've gotten mail with arcane damage
---
Boo hoo, play on a PvE server.
---
That's true and all, but I kept getting killed by a roaming 5-man all wearing raid gear. Just three levels left and I don't have to open world quest anymore.
---
You can see the amount of honor on your character tab. Press c then go to the honor tab.
---
I got a DK in my group and it reduced by honor by about 15%
---
Yeah that seems to be the consensus so a lot of people are trying to see how many DKs they can get in the first week.
---
What guild is griefing? name pls
---
i'm just gonna play some other games for a few days lol shits fucked
---
I didn’t group and solo’ed targets for 100+ honor. 
---
Raids aren’t worth the DHKs.
---
The journey is not that fun when you are remembered you are a clothie lvl 55 and you give honor to all of those thirsty 60's full geared with lvl 60 mount
---
Yeah that was me. I'm Cjdrax and I lied about the last bit because I thought it sounded better. Sorry bro, was just trying to get that honor. You're the first person I've killed in probably 15 levels.
---
Its fascinating how people using "my dude" are the worst. Without exceptions.
---
Maybe in the keyring patch? Or too early maybe
---
Shadow guard has 3 charges. 3x10= 30.
---
I'm not boo-hooing.
---
I'm on the Horde side.
---
I don't want to see all the Alliance leave and have the server barren and only Horde dominated.
---
Maybe you do, but I don't.
---
Definitely. I don’t claim to be a PvP expert but I’ve had a number of runins where they *should* have beat me but made an astronomically stupid mistake.
---
Of course he cares, his entire identity revolves around this lmao
---
PVE servers better be ready to take the influx of PVPers who are finding out what world PVP actually means.
---
Can't speak for cat vs owl; I've always had a dog or cat because they're all around solid HP, dps, etc...  for when something goes wrong.
---
In vanilla, you needed to be careful about what you tame, and careful about what you dismiss.  For instance, if you go back to tame Humar when you're level 40; you had to level the cat up from 20 something.  What I'm not sure about is if you, the hunter had to gain XP from the kill in order for your pet to gain XP...  I kind of feel like it was.
---
Unacceptable, you keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means. If they were really unacceptable people would be quitting, yet I'm sure most people just sit there and stare at the screen waiting for the server to come back up - that is the exact same thing you would do if you thought the servers were acceptable.
---
I strongly dislike bartender to be honest
---
And you base this off of one day?
---
I'm on a server with 32 / 68, where I belong to the 32% alliance and I had a blast. Eventually most of the pvp hype will die and it will be gank squads running around pursuing r14 but not like we've seen today, at least not on every server.
---
[https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24959-TipTacforClassicquickfix.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24959-TipTacforClassicquickfix.html) here you go.
---
This post is the definition of boo-hooing. No one cares.
---
That isn't possible.
---
What, like the Bay Area, or the Central Valley?
---
Dude you're weird
---
Yeah I'm Pagle horde.  If anything they should combine our queues since that looks like that would give a 50/50 split, or close to it.
---
even with Lua script?
---
As a current skeram alliance player: fuck off.  This happens at any given moment on any real pvp server.  Alliance also frequently control the mountain, and although a horde guild managed to snipe Kazakk we continuously wiped them.
---
Do we really have any source from Vanilla though? Maybe priest burn always worked this way and people were less knowledgeable so it wasn't as know or frequently taken advantage of.
---
Alliance were annihilating the horde in hillsbrad, on bigglesworth , 11am-2pm
---
same!! i’m too scared to commit so i just keep rerolling. level 30 is my highest
---
the part where you said it was just a joke
---
Yeah you have to farm your bis gear anyways which you can already start doing. Brd is already possible with 55 with a decent group, scholo and strath I would advice to be 57 and ubrs and lbrs is ok at 58. Dire maul from 55+ onwards depending on wing. You can even be a little bit lower than I said but randoms are less likely to take you. We have molten core on farm since 7 weeks and I still miss 2 bis pieces from dungeons albeit running them nonstop so it's really beneficial to start now and not later.
---
Yeah there are like 50 threads in the past week about Horde players pissed that there are no Alliance anywhere and everyone transferred off.
---
So yeah, "no one cares" except the hundreds of people whining about faction imbalance.
---
Let me see if there is a post about "Faction Specific Transfers" on the top page.
---
Oh yep, there is.
---
It's the first day. People are excited. Just let them have this. It will calm down. Just like layering. Just like login queues. Just like literally everything. It'll be ok.
---
Definitely not a “very small part of the content” whatsoever, but I do catch your drift.
---
Mostly on this sub today to read these seething posts. This is a MMO not competitive matchmaking csgo/overwatch/LoL etc. Horrible analogy.
---
The purpose of DK was to stop high level players from griefing quest npcs and vendors and it was added some months after the honor system in vanilla. They should be disabled until p5 or p6 for classic, its ruining city raids and encourages same faction griefing.
---
...yes. You get rewarded for being organized and getting a full raid out amd ready the quickest.
---
If the other faction shows up, PVP is fair game, but you literally have no way to prevent your own faction from griefing your attempts.
---
Oh damn. Why did they wait....
---
He’s not wrong though. Servers are better it’s just that the backbone is not made for this. And ofc them putting like 3 times as many people on a server as they did in vanilla Didn’t help them
---
Hunter arcane shot builds?
---
Yep, thankfully myself and the Lock are IRL mates and have been levelling up together the whole time. We were arguing over who should get a Shadow Drakestone; I was saying he should, and he was saying I should. 
---
No Drakestone dropped. Just a load of int/stam Mail because *of course*.
---
Cries in 37.
---
Same character since launch day.
---
idk man, I think its fair game to try and cap the tag urself if u are able. Sure it fucking sucks to be on the short end of the stick - but if u get played u get played. Thats kind of the charm of it. imo
---
Youlittlebitchdontyouknowwhothefuckiam?
---
Dungeons will be best, but if you really just want to solo northern Azashara is so far out of the way not many people will bother you there.
---
working as intended
---
More like your 50/50 has more alliance care bears than horde chads
---
heehe le' cool contrarian guy ;-) lets not put pressure on blizz, y'all sheep or what? Just play the game, see ya around kiddo.
---
I'm lvl 32 :) but my sub just expired so I'm taking a break anyway
---
A little more than 9000 kills per day
---
There are more people in this picture than there are people online on Arcanite Reaper-Horde right now :(
---
It's brutal. And the journey to 60 is a long one. Enjoy it. Don't rush.
---
I’ve always heard Twitch streamers have giant egos. But these guy seems so down to Earth!
---
Real talk. 1 day of fame and this dude loses his mind.
---
I think he just said that is what one of his choices are. Just like a bully talk shit while somebody is walking away.
---
I am on a server with 2k+ ppl in queues (Mograine) and there were 220 lvls 60s in Hillsbrad Foothills right when honour released. Thats nothing.
---
"Let them have this"??
---
What am I letting them have. It's not like my post is stopping anyone.
---
I'm just pointing out the facts.
---
Horde players on my server have been crying about a lack of Alliance. People on reddit have been crying about a lack of Alliance.
---
Alliance players have been routinely making threads about what good servers to flee to, and people have been whining for weeks now that faction specific server transfers aren't a thing.
---
I'm just pointing out the fact that this was a problem a week ago. And today and the next few weeks to Christmas are going to be huge.
---
I'd bet you my next Epic piece that Alliance players transfer or quit the game in droves over the next two weeks.
---
thanks. also just found out that leatrix plus does it too
---
glad I'm not the only one. I was terribly afraid of accidently rolling on a realm thats incredibly inbalanced faction wise etc
---
I read the copypasta in another thread and thought the person who wrote it was being hilarious.  I didnt realize he actually said this shit.  What a fucking maniac lol
---
I dont think anyone can calculate that for you, it depends on the server you play, and what you kill ( enemy ranks )
---
over 9000?!!?
---
Hahaha hey mate! Ahhh small world.
---
Sub 2 hour MC next week, that’s the goal!
---
Meeh let them leave then the tram will be ours!
---
It doesn't, what happens is a raid will form, hold territory, opposing faction forms own raid, they fight, control goes and forth. What was happening on Skeram prior to the big exodus: Horde takes over BRM, Alliance don't have the numbers to fight, Horde controls BRM all night. Horde gets bored, moves to Lakeshire, burns the entire zone down for hours before moving to Duskwood, repeat.  
---
Again, you aren't brace, just dumb.
---
Leave it up to somebody on reddit to make it their job to correct somebody without acknowledging the real issue at hand.
---
No I don’t think it should stack.
---
At 930 hks. 0 lag. Why would I lie?
---
Haha thought so! Yeah the story did sound great. That was a good fight though man. I just laughed so hard after we both killed each other.
---
That was a fucking walk though. All my cooldowns we’re up by the time I respawned.
---
I believe it. I was "off-tank" for an UBRS run the other day on my shaman and my healers kept whispering me that if it wasn't for me in that run we would have all been dead because the "main tank" was a arms-fury, not fury-prot. And he had no idea what he was doing and he couldn't hold aggro for shit.
---
Oh stop. The OP pointed out WPVP was -never- like this before. It wasn't. This is griefing. Especially on the outnumbered servers.
---
Just release BGs and call it good.
---
Stop following me dude. Its pathetic.
---
You probably have an entirely different set of server hardware... I dont see how a DDOS attack could cause lag in a single zone and no where else.
---
I get that it's frustrating that a game does not do what you want it to do. But WoW has never been good at large scale pvp. You can argue that if the game allows large scale pvp, it should function properly, but at the core that's never the kind of game WoW was, or is. I don't know if it's fair to expect large scale world pvp to be smooth now when it never was. And comparing to other games (or private servers for that matter) is simply not a valid argument, because they're completely different things. 
---
I do think Blizzard should try to improve the situation, and at the very least communicate about it more, but it's not as simple as some people make it out to be. If it was, Blizzard would have done it already.
---
Right and you’re implying the 2k+ people in queue are all 60s who think that wpvp is a very small part of wow content?
---
So basically like most big streamers?
---
Some just hide it better than others but Streamer is something that attracts both the worst of the worst playing the games and the worst of the worst viewers.
---
Spending a single day in /r/livestreamfails should give you enough data to show that the entire scene is pure cancer.
---
Hey so I’m a tank warrior normally but going arms for pvp is there an add on or a way to have a different profile for bars depending on which spec im in? I’m using dominos currently
---
Second this - just to add you may Adele incinerate your PC and adopt the Amish lifestyle. That 1DK has ruined your gaming future forever
---
It doesn't matter at all.
---
a DK substracts a flat amount of rating points immediately when the DK happens and nothing more.
---
Since in Week 1 everybody has 0 RP it does not matter
---
Itll hit January 1st and they'll be like, "No, we meant the Mayan calendar."
---
I'm assuming energy is restored based on server ticks, so an energy tick tracker would essentially be a server tick tracker.
---
It's the first day of the honor system is all I'm saying and you're already lamenting the end times. It was like this in vanilla and it's a fresh new experience all over again. People will get bored soon. That's all I'm saying.
---
DON'T PANIC
---
That SS might aswell be a video with how the servers are atm
---
That's not how that works.
---
It's required by US law to make sure all viewers of a video/stream online know if you are being paid. If someone is playing a game and their stream title does not say paid ad, sponsored, or something similar in it then they are breaking US law, which is where Twitch is based and whose laws they must follow and make streamers follow. Any streamer who makes a living doing it won't be caught dead trying to shill a game behind the backs of their audience.
---
However, most big streamers won't play a game they dislike anyway unless the amount of money is exorbitant. Most contracts for playing a video game are on an hours basis, time spent playing the game live. Putting yourself through 24 hours of shitty game that your audience can easily see is shitty is not going to win you or your viewership any favors. These streamers can make a sponsorship's worth of money in a week playing something fans enjoy and they enjoy. A streamer also can't make a bad game look good, they can just entertain people them self while playing a bad game. Why bother playing shitty games and lying while people can easily see you're bullshitting how much fun it is?
---
Viewers aren't so dumb that they like anything a streamer plays. If people aren't enjoying the stream they go watch one of the other 10+ streamers they're following.
---
And also, I guarantee you more than 220 people are wpvping lmfao don’t be so naive.
---
Nah it's absolutely reasonable for my girlfriend to think it's not ok that I would sink all of my free time into a game, hardly spent any time with her and get nothing done. Sure your girlfriend needs to understand that you have a hobby and accept it. She does not need to accept that you out an unhealthy amount into a computer game and she is right when she says I shouldn't be playing again right now
---

Google petopia or a hunter guide in classic and read up.  There's too much info to type out.

RE you guys restarted?

Which ones?

You quit before it was released?
---
" Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. "
---
" Racism is the belief in the superiority of one race over another. It may also mean prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity. "
---
Both are very similar as a discrimination based on sex/gender or race/ethnicity.
---
Discrimination is normal but as civilized peoples we try to avoid using certain criteria for obvious reasons.
---
This part of the thread was discussing if some sentences where sexist or not, i don't see any red herring and was not trying to divert the attention from the OP.
---
Yes, the method i was suggesting is kind of a shortcut and can lead to fallacies but it's still useful in most cases and not always one.

I never played classic before but 2019 - 11- 14 Kargath, never forget.
---
Wow amazing. Keep at it bro. Thanks for your story
---
Jeeeesus
---
Context is king
---
Yeah honestly it's kind of disheartening.
---
There is one place in the server where a relatively equal fight is going down and that's Hillsbrad.
---
Everywhere else is just Horde dominated and the Alliance have basically all but disappeared.
---
I went from having fun to feel like I'm just smashing faces without any challenge.
---
This isn't a "war" or a "battle" it's just a one sided massacre.

As I stated, it is a microcosm of life.

I recommend a paper written by Jan Boxill, lecturer of philosophy at UNC-Chapel Hill, entitled The Moral Significance of Sport. I'm not saying that video games cannot mimic the benefits of sports in some ways. However, clicking and tapping keys on a keyboard is not the same as using your body to achieve the same objectives. If you contend otherwise I would argue that you're missing a greater point, which is that our bodies are important tools that we need to take care of or even strengthen to maximize our experience in life. You cannot live longer as a result of excercising your weapon skill in WoW. However, picking up an actual sword and learning to use it better will make you stronger and have positive impacts on your health. 
---
I'm aware that sports fanaticism can become silly or even dangerous. As can extreme fanaticism of a video game. I'm aware of the tribalistic nature of sports, which is a result of human nature not a contributer to it. I love video games. I love the escapism and story telling nature of it. But I can find these things in sports as well. The difference is that video games or its predecessors (Roleplaying games, board games, card games) do not promote physical well being, which whether you believe it or not, is incredibly important to our survival. Not just individually but as a species. I can't do much to help you understand the importance of physical fitness. It may be too late for you to prioritize that. 
---
Do yourself a favor. Try not leaning on Google as a source for the why's in life. Sometimes a little critical thinking will take you further than clicking and tapping.
---
What. Is. Your. Point. Exectly? 
---
I'm guessing you work in IT, system administrator, developer or something? And therefor you're like "ey guys it's okay for this multi billiondollar company to have servers that sucks, because a bunch of russian basement kids took a couple of shortcut and skipped some backgrounds checks when they made their bootleg server that ran on 100$ a month, you guys literally don't understand how servers work or what (like i do, i work in the buiz)?" 
---
Like do you know anything, aaanything at all about blizzards current server architecture, code or workflow? Is there some academic research paper  you have access to that we don't? Could you please explain to us exactly what the problem is, and why it's okay that the servers run this way?
---
tried running brd with a few mates tonight. took us a looooong time to get into the instance :P
---
Dank pasta
---
What are you upset at exactly? 
---
That the servers went down on Thursday for maintenance despite the blue post saying they just "turn it on"?
---
We saw that happen when there was only like 10 servers on launch. They listen, they just dont care.
---
Mages can solo level inside dungeons. Use an alt to reset them so you don't get killed when you go out to reset.
---
The last two levels makes up 10% of the entire XP for 60.
---
Nope. Had a  pretty good day actually. Thanks for asking!
---
I am trained in orcish warfare and I'm the top no-lifer on the entire server.  I will wipe you out with aoe the likes of which has never been see in this realm, mark my fucking words.
---
Ah man that really sucks, loot drama is annoying as hell. Unfortunately you do get a lot of people who will spend all their DKP on one thing then go “I have none left why bother coming?”. Honestly, those aren’t the people you want to play with... you want the people who show up every week even when they need nothing from the raid because they care about getting everyone else geared up.
---
The people only in it for themselves won’t make it far in raiding anyway, so just find yourself a guild with fun people you enjoy hanging out with and running things, the gear will sort itself.
---
Saw you all setting up very cool
---
No, that makes no sense.
---
I read that in Randy from southparks voice
---
And there is the whole depreciating returns on honor thing.  Each kill on a player results in less honor the next time.
---
Isnt that a bit dishonest though? From what ive heard people were also using massive amounts of cheats and exploits on those servers, things that paying players would find even more unacceptable.
---
It really has not, on the character tab. I know this because I pressed C to check if the honor tab was up both Tuesday and Today and was like "cool its up" today and not Tuesday.
---
Your addon experience may vary.
---
Good, I'm glad to hear that.
---
No deathcoil until 42
---
&gt; It was like this in vanilla
---
No, it really wasn't. I was on a high pop Vanilla PVP server and the simple fact of the matter is servers had realm population limits that were 10x less than now.
---
If 100% of the Horde players were out PVPing in Vanilla they still would not be covering the same amount of ground that the vastly larger amount of players per-server are today.
---
And without layers, it means that entire areas are not just contested, they are literally unplayable for the opposite faction.
---
It's not like there are 40 dudes roaming one area. There are 5 groups of 40 roaming the whole zone.
---
The server limits were simply not intended for this many people.
---
No matter how many Horde are PVPing it should not take the Alliance 2 hours to get from Feralas flighpath to Dire Maul. The game was never designed around this many people killing and griefing.
---
I'm sticking by my statement. Alliance are gonna transfer off or unsub in droves over the next month. I'd bet my left testicle if Blizz released the data that this will be the case.

I just found out that recently you’re allowed to add the opposing faction using the “Add Battletag Friend” option from the Character Portrait. If I remember correctly, this is not supposed to be allowed on PvP servers and was not working until recently (possibly enabled with the phase 2 release).
---
The irony is that as arms, if he just put on a shield so he could block + revenge on cd, his threat would be more stable and hed make life a lot easier for his healer.
---
Software and hardware doesn't perform better based on how much money you have in the bank.
---
They wont fix it. Dont bother and dont waste your time.
---
I thought it also impacts future honor gains
---
Still better than those joke Blizzard servers
---
Oh man that's crazy low!
---
I'm getting ready to run my level 50 friend through ST tonight... Can't wait to get him a ton of stuff
---
They don't care about the event people just love hearing about arrogant people getting fucked
---
How do you fuck up this hard? Easiest job...
---
Download the software for the mouse you're using. Increase dpi setting. Enjoy and good luck.
---
LBRS will give you the best xp/hour, but grinding dungeons that have your pre-raid bis is a good idea as well.  Since it's phase 2, I would expect most of the instances you want to run will be camped, though... so expect to do a lot of corpse running to get in the dungeons.
---
Nearly every group I have joined where items were reserved, master looter was used. The only obvious exception is random drops (like strat orbs)
---
Seriously people will switch to master loot every time for HOJ, or for arena boss, or for their princess ring, or special ring, or rend loot... 
---
Doesn't matter if nobody in the group can use it, they don't trust you won't take it for gold. But how am I supposed to trust you wont take any other possible drops for gold?
---
Net-o-matic, harm prevention belt
---
Im playing this game only for wpvp, I would say wpvp is about 80% of the available content right now.
---
Can sume 1 please explain why being lvl 48 in phase 2 is a bad thing
---
There is no bug with Rogue energy or vanish. Both of them are working exactly like they did in Vanilla. Cant speak to the FD bug but vanish is fine and there are plenty of videos showing the exact same energy regen in classic and vanilla.
---
Is that really how
---
Level 60s boosting you was nerfed about a month ago, this no longer works.
---
You have to be boosted by someone to whom the mobs are still green, and the XP is reduced for the lower level player.
---
Good for you :)
---
No need for the navy seal version, we got a jokerd version now.
---
Those damned BRD quests
---
\[A little later.\]([https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyArbitraryAlfalfaCoolStoryBro](https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyArbitraryAlfalfaCoolStoryBro))
---
The problem is that people like yourself either truly believe that this game should perform exactly the same as a reverse engineered version of it, or you're just enjoying being a silly troll. So which is it? 
---
To make it clear: I am not apologizing for anyone. Blizzard should do what they can to fix this, even though you can argue whether it's fair to expect it. At the very least they can communicate about it. But using nonsense arguments is useless.
---
Just farm 900g. It's going to take less time than farming barons mount
---

---
Huge upgrade from 15 years ago amirite?
---
Fuck it was some awesome pvp today ! Wish i dont have to work tomorrow lol so i can continue this :D Sure TM VS SS was laggy but not all the time and fighting around the world was fine without lag .Had a blast !
---
ahahahaha spot onnnnn lad
---
Doesn't it get between the keys?
---
Is there actually still no key-ring?
---
Almost never the case in the groups I was. And in those they just used ML for the boss.
---
Don't bother arguing with the apologists man, they seem to actually enjoy having hot shit sludge piped into their mouth.
---
Good luck getting into BRD.  I hope you enjoy corspe running...
---
Totale agree this screenshot was the begin of an awesome experience
---
Yes that is the part we all understand. Now tell me what causes deep breathe to happen or not and I will be impressed.
---
So world bosses spawned ? Who got em and on which servers ?:D
---
He is a total fucking nob head and clearly has mental health issues.
---
Was he referring to himself in the 3rd person?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dwg6w5/server_issues_on_euzandalar_tribe_while_fighting/
---
So whats this then? You want to argue that these servers aren't lagging as hell?
---
Hahaha 🤣
---
You really are boring. Try harder.
---
If you’re a tank or healer you should just start your own group. “LFM tank + dps” should work.
---
True. 2-3 prob more accurate. 1-2 hours, rested, in a dungeon spam group is probably possible though
---
You can’t heal through 100 sapper charges
---
Not to be rude but sometimes google is better then reddit. Also respec to what? You are already the in the best solo farm spec.
---
Profession wise I would go mining or herbalism and make money from that.
---
Just dungeon as per the 100 other posts. Don't even do BRM at your level go do Strath and Scholo.
---
I am saying that to show I am not playing on some dead server.
---
You mean pathetic Alliance are dying everywhere? Shame.
---
My alt is 43 and it hasn’t stopped the horde yet.
---
&gt;  I'm not sure about is if you, the hunter had to gain XP from the kill in order for your pet to gain XP
---
You do. If you have a lvl 20 pet and you are 40, you have to kill green (to you) mobs (at least) to get the pet leveled.
---
We can argue about whether it is in fact unacceptable, but my point is that it makes no sense to compare the game to its reverse engineered version. They may look the same, but they aren't at all.
---
Think all servers had 2 spawn
---
For you. Most ppl dont give a shit.
---
Restart on a PVE server.
---
Seriously no key-ring yet? FFS.
---
Ninjaing is when you loot/take any item irrespective of any described loot rules.
---
If we went with literally no changes, then server population should have been capped at around 3k per realm and not 30k (arbitrary numbers. might differ from real numbers).
---
Yup. Used to have to unequip all of your items and attack with a skinning knife or mining pick.
---
Bot/cheat detection isn't trivial, but it's also not done using the same server resources as the main game logic such as player actions. Even if it were the case (which would be _astoundingly_ poor design and absolutely inexcusable), the performance difference is simply far too significant to be explained solely by this.
---
But actually it was supposed to be  a shaman mount.
---
how is master looter decided
---
And they did quit, the only times queues are 2k+ now is prime time on the day of a new phase or Raid day. Still blizzard is doing Worse then some neckbeards who hosted a free to play server/servers with 15k players. The best part is you could have 80v80 in brm with basically 0 lag on private servers. Blizzard is so shit and they only want our money they dont give a shit about this, they are probably just hoping world PvP will die out soon so ppl cant see how pathetic their servers are
---
Legit question, how can a casual (playing 2h a day max) compete in pvp with non casual players? It is possible?
---
FYI Everlook is a fucking blood bath, lots of ganks and large groups fighting.
---
I'm not sure, but both quests are in game and I've seen an Inferno tome drop. So I would think it is
---
Dreadmist woop!
---
I Think rank 3 is the highest you can get during the first week
---
I mean, it's a novelty event So it will look impressive at first. But most people don't actually want this outside of a very short period of time.
---
Few points. Not that many people will continue to do this 1-2 weeks from now. There are more people on your realm who won't even do it at all. There are a  lot of people still waiting for phase 3 in order to pvp.
---
"Failed phase 2" keeps making me laugh. This is exactly what phase 2 was like in vanilla. No changes lol
---
55-57 BRD
---
57-58/59 LBRS
---
58-60 Strat/Scholo/DM east
---
There was a post about someone doing that a few weeks ago. Bug or not, it's definitely not new.
---
It depends on how competitive your server is. What matters is your standing/ranking compared to other players.
---
We tried, it was fun for a few hours, can we have bg's now?
---
Yours and everyone else’s as I was there earlier and 4 lvl 45 to 48 and few 60 farming pearls
---
Best video on this reddit to date!
---
Just come to lights dawn and whisper me your name and I swear we won’t kill you.
---
FoW is an Emperor drop, HoJ is an Anger drop. 
---
Both of these questions have to do with mitigation vs. threat. In general, you will need threat more than mitigation if it comes from your ability to hit, and mitigation over things like crit, attack power, or others, though those stats are also useful.  
---
Mitigation is important, but if you can't keep aggro, the raid is going to wipe. In the case of HoJ, a 2% chance to double hit means you will just generate that much more threat. And while FoW might seem nice, it only covers melee, and only reduces melee damage taken by 25 - which is a pittance for some of these scary lava bosses who are going to hit you with fire attacks that can 2 shot you if they crit. 
---
As for Nagelring, it's fine but other items are BiS again for threat. Blackstone Ring and Tarnished Elven ring give 1% hit a piece - meaning a 1% better chance of generating threat on a given attack. Tanks, like everyone else in a raid, cannot afford to miss opportunities to hit attacks - melee dps needs to hit to hold aggro, you need to hit to outpace the threat they generate. Missing attacks will eventually take its toll on your raid group as you fail to keep up with those who can/do land every attack and lose aggro to dps.
---
How can you say most people? I have played this game exclusively for almost 3 years, MOST people  do give a shit.
---
Just sell your enchants, pretty simple.
---
Play what's fun for you. It's not like you have to delete your lvl 53 to enjoy your warrior!
---
no they weren’t mate, don’t buy into all the shit you hear
---
It's a great staff for a warlock! Fuck all the haters!
---
I'm still level 31 &gt;.&gt;
---
There are dozens of us, dozens!
---
It is kinda like the Breaking Bad, "I am the one who knocks" monologue...except it is about leveling in wow, not being a murderous drug kingpin.
---
It is almost as if someone intentionally tried to turn a badass speech into something as sad as possible by changing the subject/person saying it.
---
What the speakers do have in common is obvious personality disorders.
---
Has he commented at all on the situation?
---
Hey thank you! I will look into it
---
RNG is a fuckle mistress. I've seen five sashes on my 54 shaman (out of 6 kills), zero rings yet. Unreal.
