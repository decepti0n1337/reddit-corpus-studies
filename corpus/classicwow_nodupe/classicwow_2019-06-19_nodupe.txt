I guess of the speed running thing takes off but... i mean, locking out players for days to save buff durations and hours of farming to save an hour or 2 on a night seems counter intuitive.
---
---
---
seems like a bunch of effort for one day of beta access, I'd rather uninstall and see what happens i dunno
---
One thing to keep in mind with hunters, there's definitely a big skill variance in them. Swing timers was a thing in Vanilla and TBC, and it meant a huge difference in your DPS as a hunter.
---
Try [this](www.google.com), it'll change your world.
---
&gt;Is it realistic to be a Warrior in raids if I have no interest in tanking?
---

---
Absolutely, it's the strongest raid DPS in game, starting from about preraid gear and forever.
---
However, it could be a good idea to tank dungeons for 10 times faster grouping, and to be ready (I see that you are) for emergency tanking/probably 4HM tanking (literally one boss).
---
first off don't bother keybinding your buffs or weapon enchants, put them on a seperate bar and just click. same with most classes.
---
Yesss! Represent!
---
There’s not much to discuss when the entire sub is just an echo chamber
---
Try [this](www.google.com) , it'll change your world.
---
Anyone raiding TK or SSC did...
---
That would be fantastic. Just really t-up the current climate in the gaming industry with that crap
---
eh, i think i'll pass, kinda pointless paying 10 quid for one day of level 15 playing
---
ty tho for info, all of you :)
---
How high are you?
---
If nothing else, I cannot imagine trying to do Blackwing Lair at level without rogues in the raid. The suppression room would be all but impossible without them.
---
What about the badge vendor from Sunwell patch?
---
Try [this](https://www.google.com/), it'll change your world.
---
Did classic have spell batching?
---
It's funny when suckers lose their money.
---
It’s $15 for 48 hours. You can’t even get parking for that price.
---
&gt; I assume N3WT0N has an active sub? That might be the difference.
---
Not necessarily. I have 5 accounts, and all 5 show up under account when I select either WoW or Classic.
---
I can launch any of them into the Classic version. Only 1 has a sub.
---
Not OP, but they could be referring to this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzbzl4/extended_melee_range_in_classic_beta_leeway/
---
Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the people who are tricked into thinking they can raid in a hardcore guild as a meme spec, thanks to all the dreamers on this subreddit who downvote anyone who says otherwise.
---
Play whatever you like, have fun however you like, but unfortunately in vanilla there are some speccs that are just _awful_ choices in raids, and many people are going to want to take that into account when creating their character. And that's _fine_.
---
I mean they can always add servers even months down the road
---
48 hours and thats a personal choice I guess. I want to test a few things on my own and its well worth the money to me.
---
Unless you had previous stress test &amp; beta - I do not have beta, but it still shows up under 'in development'
---

---
i was a drama jerk, guildhopping moron back in the day.
---
Ah, well enjoy it dude! hope you have fun :)
---
Been in all those situations and here are the answers;
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
rogue- Rogue is the easiest class for me personally. I love fighting rogues because it is almost a 99% win chance unless they pull a frost resister and play all their cards right.  It is a guaranteed chance of me beating them, so much i killed a bonescythe rogue while in green/blue spirit gear.  Immediately when it opens, trinket&gt;feign death+ice trap macro&gt;run far back in aspect of cheetah, wait till cripping gets off if its on&gt; mark rogue&gt;serpent sting&gt;run opposite way while having pet attack with intimidation and beastial wrath. They will sprint after you and use speed pots to try and get close, but they never will. They could try to kill your pet instead, at that point you run out of range till your pet dissapears so you can recall and heal and go back to remark rogue. But because their gear is so squishy, you can get them below 50% while they try and white damage your pet.
---
Warrior- Similar situation. Most dont bother chasing you because they dont have sprint and will never get in range, so they know its futile. Instead they always focus on pet, so do the same as you would for rogue. If they are too gear, they will kill pet quick so always try to escape out of range or put pet on stay if they are chasing you while hitting pet at the same time. Any same gear warr, youll always beat them and should be easy to kite.
---
Pal- They cant produce enough damage to kill you in quick time anyway, so if they ever do get close, you can always wait it out till your ice trap resets cooldown while wingclipping them and forcing them to hands of freedom. Once its over, just wingclip get distance and concussion and back into cheetah. Keep viper stinging till they run out of mana trying to cleanse as your pet is on them. If they are super geared, you cant kill them due to mana restrictions and how they dont seem to run out of their own mana, but they will never kill you either as long as you keep distance and kite. 
---
Mage- The only one who stands a chance, but with similar gear shouldnt be too hard. Its like a bright star, it burns fast with a big explosion. Granted, the only mages that beat me were ones with really high pve gear. They will blink towards you and fire blast your aspect of cheetah. My pet will be bestial wrath and intimidation. I try to feign death+ trap them, forcing them to ice block. The main objective is to wait them out as long as possible for viper sting to remove all their mana. And keep kiting just enough to stay away from deadzone, and when they get too close, you go straight to melee them and hope you can out dps their dps. It's a close one for sure, but some times i can often kite them if they mess up their blink and dont get close enough.
---
Warlock is probably the most annoying because itll dot your pet or you, and regardless if you end up killing it or not, you might die too in the process or come out severly hurt. So i try and stay away as much as possible and just go in to viper sting and get out.
---
Oh please god give the Russians their own servers!
---
Are the 5 silver, 6 slot bags not available on vendors?
---
Update: Uninstalled, Restarted Blizz app and its still there hmmm
---
Yes, if you have an active subscription.
---
Why are there 4 labels for 2 circles?
---
I had the actual beta for wow, and I played during vanilla to. However I got banned in WOTLK for using a bot to farm the archeology mount... Doesn't show that account :-(
---
“Your mother was a Dwarf with a fat ass, did you know that?”
---
You can play other places for free...
---
Twist ending:
---
You end up beating the shit out of your 16 year-old self for ninja looting
---
There are fights when bosses have a threat drop. Which needed to be trained off, no?
---
This is a relief to hear, I’m also gonna be playing purely for fun. I absolutely want to raid etc, but in fun ways only. Glad there’s like minded players.
---
How did you know jaedanar was associated with warlock doe
---
Upvote because of Betrayal at House on the Hill!
---
Be the leader or you dont know. But not evenryone in the world is evil.
---
But some are.
---
Yeah. Spell batching started in vanilla, partially because the 2004 player base had more people playing on potatoes with dial up connections. iirc spell batching in retail has a much shorter "tick" duration.
---
Look up the Immersion addon, makes reading quests much more enjoyable. I've been reading them in the beta (I tell myself I'm looking for typos hah).
---
If you're wanting to watch a Hunter stream, try Zeroed. He plays at pretty high level, but is new to streaming.
---
For what it’s worth, I liked it. I get the opinions but the downvotes feel personal.
---
what the heck, they deleted my realm!
---
The entire point of my post is that I think new players benefit far more from learning about the game by playing it rather than reading a BiS list that won't be relevant to them for a long time. 
---
I don't think asking "Haven't played since Wrath, is ret pally viable in classic?????" Benefits the player or anyone else.
---
TBC definitely introduced the concept of "catch-up gear" as a knee-jerk to the culture within guilds progressing in BT. "The train left the station" was kind of a thing back then. In fact, it's funny talking about this because listening to the recent Rise of Azshara Developer Insight w/ Ion Hazzikostas, he's talking about the exact same thing.
---
Idk if he knows what a ven diagram is
---
Damn. 23k is a nice step up. Don't worry about Classic, it will still be there once you're free :)
---
I guarantee you, you will thank me for having a set of strictly spirit/intellect gear as a hunter. No more stopping to drink, just unlimited no downtime from 1-60 grinding
---
This is the single most beautiful example of human decency I have ever witnessed.
---
I always read everything was super into the story and the lore back during vanilla. This time around in classic I won’t be reading any of it because I know it already
---
How are they similar? I've jumped between the two and they don't even feel like the same game anymore.
---
Is that what PTO means?!  Then fetch MOAR!
---
Right, thats a great point. Didn't think of that
---
definitely not with a warlock. I hate that class more than anything else to play. Except priest, priests are a step more boring.
---
WHO DAT DARE?
---
With wand?
---
They weren't just naysayers, they were openly hostile and would ridicule anyone who brought up classic.
---
Some of them are awful. Still, ouch.
---
some ways of playing are more optimal than others 
---
this is a discussion forum where op asked how shamans deal with many binds (optimally); saying clicking shouldn't be used for optimal play is relevant, "not elitist" and didnt warrant your hissyfit
---
Not much to discuss when the entire sub is just an echo chamber
---
If that was a valid argument, then no one would really care at all about Classic’s launch. They’d just stick to their approximate recreations.
---
&gt; What I'm seeing that bugs me is people who have never played Vanilla asking for what's viable or what's the best raiding spec or what's the BiS gear for their class.
---
maybe... maybe they like raiding, and want to know what's the best for that?
---
&gt; I also want people to appreciate the ~200+ hours in between levels 1 and 60
---
Cool. I won't yuck your yum. But leveling's boring as shit for some people, and just a necessary evil to get to the part they enjoy.
---
&gt; I'm seeing
---
&gt; bugs me
---
&gt; I want
---
&gt; I also want
---
&gt; I really like
---
Cool. Other people are allowed to like other things.
---
&gt;What I'm seeing that bugs me is people who have never played Vanilla asking for what's viable or what's the best raiding spec or what's the BiS gear for their class.
---
"*NOOOO STOP PLAYING THE GAME THE WAY YOU LIKE! YOUR WAY OF ENJOYING THE GAME IS WRONG AND BAD!!!*"
---
No RPPVP listed. Not a good omen for those of us who played on one.
---
People spend hundreds a week on liquor
---
I love it for clothies like priests and warlocks. But armored classes? Absolutely the fuck not. That's why I run undead for clothies and orc for pretty much everything else.
---
Older and higher the you
---
Thaaat is a lot of realms
---
I think that this is a great idea. But I think it could have an unforeseen effect on the class diversity on the server. Like thrall is majority horde and proudmoore is majority alliance, for example.
---
Did you have the beta installed at any point? For the other stress test?
---
This guy posts constantly and much of it is nonsense.
---
I'm far from the first to say it, but it really would be fantastic if they moved Mankrik's wife somewhere else so that everyone was genuinely asking this question again.
---
Eh, partially correct.  The true complaint was EMFH enabling dual pve trinkets.
---
Hoping it grows on my when I tank some lower level dungeons as I level, but I am being conservative and planning as If I won't.
---
We seriously need to create noise in the Blizzard's forums, they need to know RPPVP is needed
---
People aren't smart. They cant put two and two together
---
Wow I totally forgot about debuff slots!  Thanks—that clears it up.
---
There will always be people who could careless about the cost to try and enter a beta test. 
---
This game has "Nostalgia overload" at the moment. Many players had some fantastic experiences playing this game.  The hype train is here and you have both casual players from back in the day to hardcore raiders.
---
You also have many players who never played vanilla, and want to experience this game from 2004-2006
---
Vanilla wow is a very challenging MMO experience ready to make one hell of a comeback.
---
And its not even about 'you' in particular for example, just the shared knowledge of the overall community, the new technology outside the game, etc... 
---
Its like knowing basic Algebra in 1860 was quite something... but in 2019 its... really not much of anything.
---
&gt; thanks to all the dreamers on this subreddit who downvote anyone who says otherwise.
---
Yep, if you so much as suggest that Ret is not viable raid DPS, you get swarmed with downvotes and people crying "ELITIST! MINMAXER! TRYHARD!" and such.
---
Only counter, really. Just bring mana pots and its GG tho
---
I tell them to add me to FList if they need a tank for an instance. 
---
I make many friends this way.
---
They already said they wont be doing one. PvP, PvE, RP
---
People are going to be surprised in pvp. If they didnt play classic or havent played much wow in general all they have seen in this sub is hate for paladins and how bad their dps is. But those posts and people are only talking about raiding. In pvp it is completely different. A paladin wont use half of their kit while but in pvp when there are more variables people are gonna be confused when a decent ret paladin sticks on them and wont let go until they die and cleanses of everything they do while chasing them down with pursuit of justice
---
LF Daytime raid &amp; PVP guild.  NA &amp; PVP server. 
---
Looking for a guild that will be active during business hours in NA. Night and Weekend times are too full with work/family to consistently commit to a schedule. 
---
2-3 days a week
---
Hunter: MM w/Surv spec. 
---
Experience: Was a hunter class officer in a raid guild during Wrath.  We ran 3-4 hunters in our 25 man's. Guild fell apart before we cleared ICC (drama) think we were 10/12. 
---
Played PVP the rest of wrath, mostly world PvP and BG
---
I know the class well. Always come prepared. Am happy to kite or trap or DPS whatever. Helpful. Would have references if needed.
---
Maybe you should read what was said.
---
&gt;You should never promote clicking.
---
It has nothing to do with OPs post. He just goes around shitting on anyone who doesn't min/max. Don't be ignorant.
---
People definitely called it VC. As a noob horde, I assumed people were being stupid and meant WC, surely. They did not.
---
I don't understand this debate... DM is both Deadmines and Dire Maul, just shift click the person's name in chat - their level will indicate which dungeon they are referring to. Takes literally two seconds.
---
Just stand and get a fat mouse so you dont curl your hand as much..  standing is only hard for a bit till you get in shape for it.
---
I already listed the main ways. The gameplay is still very similar. It seems drastically different because of how they structured specs, but that can easily be changed in retail to return to how it was in classic.
---
The graphics are updated in retail, but not that much. It still looks like the same game.
---
Compare that to the differences in RS3 and OSRS. They barely look like the same game.
---
The difference which you apparently don't want to comprehend is that someone off in their own instance doing their own things does not spoil the game for anyone else.
---
Let me give you a really easy example to help you understand.
---
If you are playing a single-player FPS and you install an aimbot so you never miss and always get headshots, nobody cares. Play how you like. Do whatever is fun for you.
---
If you play a mutliplayer FPS with an aimbot, people do care because your cheating ruins the game for others.
---
What you have to think about it "how does my behaviour affect others?". If you need further explanation of this idea there are lots of very good children's TV shows that explain the idea.
---
You're triggering some very unwanted flashbacks here, my friend.
---
and perhaps reading  **xXxGodOfWar's LEVELING AND DPS GUIDE**  will make the experimenting even more fun
---
Laptop Gaming... Only way to go for a comfortable experience.
---
Play in bed or on a couch. I will never go back to desktop. 😂
---
Still on the fence though might go undead rogue lol
---
I hate paladins so fuckin bad
---
I'm glad you took the time to read the post. 
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with being efficient and min/maxing. What doesn't make sense is players who have never leveled to 10 constantly asking how to spec or gear their character. 
---
You're going to suck ass regardless for the first half of the game, my argument is that you should decide how you want to play by **playing**, not by reading a guide from a top 5% player.
---
Idiots
---
Not according to every person I talk to. The numbers don’t matter at all. Pfft 9% parry that’s nothing. The difference is certainly not almost double what pservers have.
---
Cries in bird
---
I agree with you. I think one of the things that hurts the community is this competitive idea that everyone needs to min-max everything for every fight because they want to be world first, realm first, faction first, and whatever else. I really hate that. I miss the days when it was all about friends overcoming the challenge together and not caring about everyone else.
---
&gt;Not everything needs to be looked at in a min/max raid context ffs.
---
Um, guy, it was only a question.
---
Lol.... should we tell him?
---
And none of the labels even apply to the overlapping section.
---
They're allowed to make Reddit posts too.
---
Hell yea brother.
---
Nice
---
Nah mate, I like streamers, but him questioning how a bug could exist in a beta is just too stupid.
---
It is valid.   One, most of the well known ones are shutting down when classic hits.  Two, this is a beta, so what you do doesn't matter.  Sort of like playing on the pirated realms.  Three, there will be far less latency in classic, which will improve the experience.  Four, friends might not want to play a pirated version the game.  Five, the fact that it's the official creators adds legitimacy to your accomplishments. 
---
I could probably go on.
---
Thats part of the fun! There is areal time restriction.
---
&gt; I am a bully because I used the resources available to everyone who plays the game to make a stronger character.
---
"...and then used that stronger character to sealclub levellers", yes.
---
Just as you would be a bully if you used the resources available to everyone in the real world to get big muscles and learn boxing and then beat up smaller people for fun.
---
&gt; also I was never "victimized" by a twinker. I don't see myself as a victim, i'm not a liberal.
---
Ah, you are one of those people who project all their own insecurities on to mythical "liberals". It's the "liberals" who are oversensitive, entitled, whiny, selfish, emotional thinkers with a massive victim mentality. Yup. "Liberals". Definitely *not* you.
---
You're a big, bold, brave, emotionless, two-fisted he-man who proved it by making a 19 twink in WoW and sealclubbing levellers.
---
Which is exactly the same as vanilla was and one of the main reasons they changed the talent tree: there was an illusion of choice with the old ones. From what you're saying, some thing happening to BfA, despite all the changes.
---
I had a wife once. I lost her in the barrens
---
And they can get called out for making decisions for others.
---
&gt;"Vanilla wow is not about raiding"
---
Except for all the people where it's all about raiding.
---
Doesn't Joana focus more on Horde than Alliance? He already has 1-60 while Alliance he only has to 40.
---
CauthonLuck is a legend though.
---
Im thinking bc or wrath... made it a 30% slow
---
Sorry if it's unclear but the arrows describe the two circles, the lines are for the parts that don't overlap.
---
You're still striving to be better!
---
You know what website you're on right?
---
Servers in vanilla were named after famous lore characters or locations, not items.
---
No? I wouldn't want to give it to HIM if some shit head uses 3 people to play 24 hours a day and hits it in 6 days, which to me is unrelated when talking about this single person. Go work your minimum wage job little guy. I pay more in taxes than you make a year. Move along
---
I wouldn’t mind being on an RPrealm. Are there any downsides (besides probably acute exposure to a lot of bad storytelling)?
---
Man archeage pre release and then for a little bit after was the best mmo I've ever played and it's not even close. 
---
I wish other games would take some inspiration from it.
---
Wrong and smug.  That's a great combo.
---
In 1 hour 36 minutes. Pffft I can do it in 3 hours 36 minutes!
---
I didn't have the heart
---
Classic WoW and Wildstar are the only two MMOs who held my attention more than a few months. I played WoW until MoP and Wildstar until it closed. I'd say community is the biggest factor, with some sort of activity you can repeat indefinitely and still enjoy it as what keeps me playing. WoW had the community and PvP, while I still had fun lvling a hunter over and over again as I could go out and tame different pets to be that hunter's main pet. Wildstar had god tier housing and endlessly fun pvp and the community stayed awesome, even as it shrank.
---
I for one am excited to tank! Going to roll an orc protection warrior with engineering and mining. :)
---
Time to start a petition to the kid banned for a few days?
---
Uninstall and see if its still there. Many ppl had this bug.
---
true, just the first thing that came to mind when thinking of hybrid classes. I am playing my hunter in that particular video too. :)
---
That's not how a venn diagram works...
---
Does the serenity now raid if that funeral count?
---
Seeing the same here.
---
Agreed, but all of us (back then) must of made such a fuss when the new patch dropped somebody decided to change it up and it stuck through time!
---
That can't be a coincidence.
---
In addition to what others have said a class lead was supposed to be the guild expert on the class. You would go to the class lead with questions about gearing, spec, rotations etc. In vanilla wow there was not a lot of information out there. Also, this was one of the first MMO's out there so a lot of people did not know what today would be considered basic concepts.
---
1.10 had the same catchup gear.  TBC had 2.3 with Zul Aman and that sunwell 5-man.
---
Wrath had the ICC 5-man and the catch up gear.
---
I am not really sure what your point was though.  I wish I could find a post I made on the WoW forums back in S1 warning blizzard about ilvl runaway and the world and item balance issues it will bring in future expansions, that will ultimately require stat and ilvl squishes.  It would give a lot of context to modern wow from a 2007 perspective.
---
Why not just rebrand? At this point the legacy is nothing but a hindrance.
---
Nope, it's different this time. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/h2H5eFK

I wasted $20 on a poster I had printed, so I can't say that I am blameless.
---
Good video, but the audio is really quiet.
---
Just gonna copy and paste from 'exact same' thread as posted 1 day ago.
---
Warriors (main abilities they use 99%) ww, BT, heroic strike, execute 
---
Paladin (main abiltiies they use 99%) SoC, judgement, conc, hammer of wrath
---
Then you can add how the rotation pans out:
---
Warrior: mash buttons and prioritize BT, spam HC or execute
---
Paladin: Soc, AA, judgment (dont judge before aa), Conc, during hammer of wrath you have to wait for aa again.
---
Recap: Warriors = mashing, Paladin = timing
---
Pick what you prefer, warriors do way more damage tho.
---
*squints*
---
I can’t see Blackrock on that list? There better be a Blackrock or it won’t be *real* vanilla
---
That's one massive 4head
---
"Vanilla WoW is not ONLY about raiding" ftfy
---
Questing is the ultimate casual experience.
---
I was actually thinking about (I *think) 3.2, where they added xp to battlegrounds and gave people the option of xp-locking their toons, but xp-locked toons got their own separate battlegrounds.
---
It was hilarious, because for literally years the twinkers had been claiming that what they really enjoyed more than anything else was games against other twinkers, and they didn't really enjoy dumpstering defenceless levellers at all. But the second they got exactly what they claimed they wanted, so many of them logged off and never played again that the twinkers could barely get a battleground to pop.
---
The tiny minority who really did want to play against other twinkers migrated to a particular battlegroup to try to get games happening, but even then it quickly died out.
---
That was when we all knew for sure that for the overwhelming majority of twinks, they were only in it to pick on levellers and the claim that they really wanted to fight other twinks had only ever been a self-serving lie.
---
Dude i had the same thing 30 mins ago.

Mine is gone after uninstall. Just try it out for yourself.
---
Yeah hindsight is 20/20, haha.
---
if you go 5 hunters, you can viper sting everyone in world pvp and they will go oom automatically so healers and everything, gone.
---
or 5 shamans and chain lighning everything
---
"We're trying to clean up and cash in on this sweet hype train inc!  CHoo CHoo, bitches!"
---
Nah man, look at my screenshot under Live.
---
Dam son, must be nice to be able to afford 5 classic subscriptions!
---
Hmm yes your actually right good catch.
---
It is their 2nd strongest ability in PvP, right after Blessing of Freedom, and the tier 0 bubble-hearth.
---
It's genius, that the normies cannot understand.
---
I'm not even sure I'm going to raid... Dungeon tier set here I come
---
&gt; Warrior: mash buttons and prioritize BT, spam HC or execute
---
&gt; Paladin: Soc, AA, judgment  after aa to not fk up swingtimer, Conc, at 20% hammer of wrath after aa to not fk up swingtimer.
---
Cant you keep the peon slapped and slap other players?
---
No. What your diagram would indicate is that almost all of the population fits BOTH categories, and that the labeled blue and red sections are the tiny portion of the population that is only one of the described groups, and not both at the same time. 
---
Venn diagrams are for overlapping groups, who fit multiple categories. More traditional graphs, like pie or bar charts, are for people who are parts of separate categories. 
---
Also, for your intended meaning, purple is a very poor color choice, as blue+red= purple, so it is suggested that the middle section is the addition of both categories, which is very much the opposite of your itended message (that the people you described are the tiny minority of a pvp server).
---
What in the everloving fuck is wrong with the developers, that they cannot manage to see and acknowledge the outcry for just one single RPPVP server to start with?
---
DPS warriors aren't as gear dependent as people assume.  Tanking warriors are gear dependent.
---
The drop down menu on the desktop app that lets you select the version of wow, like bfa, bfa or, classic beta and stress test. Classic live is on there for down load and it's not listed as a beta version.
---
Dunno, Dartol's Rod of Transformation (PvP) would be pretty great.
---
Even though the character progress gets erased, it can still be pretty useful.
---
System settings, addons, keybinds, and macros can all be saved and ported over for launch. This could save you several hours and is worth the $15 alone.
---
Damn .. I remember my old email.. I think.. maybe I could do this as well
---
&gt; What you saw was correlation, not caudation.
---
&gt; Xp-locking was introduced in wotlk, which was the hay-day of twinking, and absolutely did not have queue time problems on active battlegroups.
---
Dude, I was there. I saw the massive whining as the twinkers could barely get a battleground to pop in the immediate aftermath of the change. I laughed loud and long and enjoyed their salty tears.
---
It didn't kill twinking entirely, the same arseholes eventually switched to farming full heirloom sets and griefing WSG 10-19 with disposable toons that they deleted when they hit level 20, but it but a huge dent in it. And everyone who wasn't a twinker cheered.
---
Not really. If you have a flagrantly lore-noncompliant name like Stabyadead or Tankzilla or something, though, you may get reported and forced to change it. RP realms tend to have quieter, more chill communities with players more focused on immersion and community than rank 14 or scarab lord.
---
Didn’t they raise the level cap in TBC tho? Would anyone really buy a toon for the T2 set when better stuff was easy to get?
---
Right. They are suggesting a different way to name the classic realms so they don’t get confused with their retail counterparts.
---
&gt;I don't think asking "Haven't played since Wrath, is ret pally viable in classic?????" Benefits the player or anyone else.
---
I disagree entirely. For me personally, being able to contribute well in a raid environment is fun. To achieve this fun I need to know the following:
---
1. What are the odds of my class getting a raid group?
---
2. What will my role in the group be?
---
3. How easy will it be for me to progress through the raid? (item contesting)
---
4. How easy will it be to achieve maximum level?
---
The same applies to people who PvP or just like to level alts. If you want to do well in PvP, you might be interested to learn that Forsaken can break fears or that Gnomes can break snares. If you like to solo-level while being able to engage in world PvP, you might want to try a Hunter or Rogue, since Warriors tend to drop to low hp while leveling.
---
If someone liked to play Ret Pally PvE in classic, he should probably know that they are mostly relegated to being healers, and that finding a raid group as a ret paladin might be more difficult. Obviously there will be plenty of groups that accept Ret Paladins no problem, but maybe this Potential Ret Paladin wants to be a top dps or simply cares about bringing the most benefit that he can to a hardcore guild. What if the Ret Pally wants to do PvP? He will want to know that Ret Paladins are really good in PvP.
---
Leveling and building up your character takes time, and it would be a shame if you found out at lvl 60 that your chosen class or even class/race combo doesn't achieve the goals that you want to achieve. My main during BfA was a Warlock but I don't like the Classic Warlock playstyle. I sure am glad that I asked about their specs and rotations before I spent weeks leveling a Warlock after august 27th.
---
Usually the guild will run a DM tribute before the raid, everyone just goes and leeches the buffs off that run, then they portal darnassus and fly to songflower buff in felwood, then hearth and log out at the flightmaster in IF for maybe an hour tops. Its really not that difficult to orchestrate, and the speedrunning thing has already taken off on every private server out there. Theres websites that track all of that for a server, and it becomes a sort of prestige thing to full clear both MC and BWL in an hour and a half.
---
You wanted a pie chart.
---
Realms are as follows;
---
* Leeroy (RP),
---
* Unbreakable (PVP) ,
---
* Drakedog (PVP),
---
* Athene (PVE),
---
* Grim (PVP)
---
But the servers will be under an entirely different client. How would they "get confused" ?
---
I managed to totally skip over that word in your comment :')
---
no, i'm not.
---
Maybe I am overestimating the amount of people that will play classic on launch, 3 layers seems way too little. It's looking like they are going to have around 21 servers on launch (logging into classic rn shows that many) and that's only like 157k people supported on launch assuming 2.5k per server. I think there is a better chance of like 5-10 layers per server, which would support
---
 262k to 525k, which still might not be enough but sounds much more reasonable for the starting boom, while making servers have a healthy pop after the tourists.
---
Crendor for a chill stream. He used to make WoW machinimas on YouTube.
---
Cool
---
How would you save hours doing this?  Seems like most of this could be done offline.
---
They’re doing a stress test tomorrow open to anyone with an active account, they’re letting you download it today
---
Yet a lot of people fail the multiplication table😂
---
* Achievements, alt progression
---
* DKs, more tanks!
---
*  Paladins getting a taunt + tweaks to make them better tanks
---
* Mounts being the cheap purchase instead of riding skill being cheap
---
* Dual spec as everyone should be able to swap between tank/heal and dps as it encourages people to tank/heal
---
* summoning stones
---
* hunters not needing ammo or wasting a bag slot
---
I think it's because of the classic stress test tomorrow that everyone with a membership gets in
---
I agree: [https://i.imgur.com/cl5yGSB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cl5yGSB.jpg)

Pvp server and yeah I'd imagine people would try messing with me
---
Dude has been playing on private servers.  As one such player myself, my thoughts are "Why is this specifically bugged, when private servers did not have this issue?"
---
For many of us, we expected them to basically take something like the most popular private server and to then go in and clean up some values and code and then release it to us.  We expected maybe Charge and Blink issues, but this is trying to port Vanilla to whatever client and new stuff is popping up.
---
You scratch your head wondering why they chose to go this route in the first place.  Sure, from a business standpoint, makes sense.
---
You can't do any of the above without being in the game. If you don't have your UI and game settings setup on launch day, you'll have to spend the time doing it that could otherwise be spent leveling.
---
Not true, Ion said that 4 months ago but Omar later clarified they're still considering having one at launch.
---
42
---
Jokes on you I’m only 29!
---
for PVP server I would suggest planning out your leveling rout with mostly dungeon grinds, You should set up ur keybinds accordingly.
---
Yeah i just found out there is a difference 
---
Here how it looked for me before uninstalling :
---
Note that my Classic is in the developement tab 
---
Now this guy :
---
https://i.imgur.com/5A9TNV9.png
---
Got his in the Live though.
---
So that makes yours a special case. Your a none EU player with this now. 
---
I can only guess you got invited into the stress test for some reason or got full beta.
---
Or its just a bug like the other 10 times :P
---
This is in Classic.
---
We need to get Bobby B in here.
---
Ret Paladin was my favorite class, but all I could do in raids was heal.   I'm glad I got the experience in later expacs when they added more meat to the spec. But Vanilla is when I really would have enjoyed it the most since I was still new.
---
Lol make sure you don’t have to leave your computer for half an hour
---
No problem! :)
---
Yep. We almost always had 1-2 disconnects per fight, too. And half the raid had hardware that struggled to keep up. Some people would drop to 0 fps for a few seconds after each fire breath.
---
&gt; Good geared people in PvP ruin the game for people who aren't geared. At 60 this is apparently not an issue, 
---
I think it's more that at 60 you have no choice except to participate in 60 battlegrounds. At 60 you PvP in the gear you have or you don't PvP at all.
---
Whereas if you are a geared level 19 toon you have a choice. You can drop out of every other aspect of the game and spend the rest of your life spoiling WSG for levellers and being a selfish tool. Or you can play the game and level up.
---
&gt; Just why is it morally wrong at lower levels?
---
Because you have a choice.
---
&gt; Is it too easy to gear up a low level character compared to how powerful you become?
---
I think you are close to something relevant. The power difference between a 19 twink and a 19 leveller is *huge*. The twink will have more than twice the health (apparently as high as four times for druid twinks in bear form), more than twice the damage, and quite likely far higher armour and evasion to boot.
---
&gt; The Naxx raider worked hard and thus is allowed to club seals? The harder you work the more "fun" you're allowed to have?
---
Anecdotal evidence from pirate servers seems to be that Naxx gear does in fact spoil the PvP game so much that everyone else stops queueing and rerolls on another server.
---
So I don't think this argument proves what you think it does. Past a certain point gear disparity does ruin the game for everyone except the seal-clubbers.
---
You are talking minutes, and macros can be written offline.
---
Why are you making separate characters for different specs of the same class? That is silly as fuck.
---
I think I’m gonna go for it then. Names like those you cited annoy me more than people earnestly failing at storytelling (plus you can always just play off them and sort of fix it if you’re clever).
---
Ret Paladin was my favorite class/spec combo back in Vanilla. Very tough to kill in PVP, but just like Spriest ,the spec wasn't built to last longer than a few rotations. I ended up healing in Vanilla and TBC and was bored out of my mind.
---
I'm glad I got the experience to raid as ret in later expacs when they added more meat to the spec. But Vanilla is when I really would have enjoyed it the most since I was still new.
---
Might work in non-raids at 720p lowest settings. Gotta lower the resolution further into k for raids.
---
This guy knows how to WoW classic.
---
Why dont you just smash the original classic CD and snort its remains? Seems way quicker.
---
One of the things I liked about TBC was that my hunter cared a bit more about gear.
---
Ah yes good ole condescension. Definitely makes you look correct... if you paid my salary in taxes you wouldn't spend time debating pointless topics on reddit. Have a good night though and move along with your bullshit
---
Correct 
---
Joana has stated on stream multiple times he's never even did a Alli vanilla speedrun .
---
However, he's one of the best in the biz and he really puts a lot of time into his guides
---
I'm fairly certain his 1-60 Alli side will be done, and may not be 100% perfect but I'll bet it'll be over 95% functional in terms of quest placement/routes / etc
---
The list has since changed. 4 pve serves 5 pvp and 1 rp.
---
They couldnt even damage this level 58 priest lol, couldnt even break PW:S. It would be even more pathetic to see them fight warriors or locks.
---
1.12 rogues lol. Damn.
---
&gt;**Realm Differences**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;During tomorrow’s stress test, we plan to experiment with different settings that control the population of players. We plan for it to be a blind test, so we don’t intend to publicize which realms have which settings (or when).  
---
&gt;We’d love to hear your feedback on your experience from level 1-15 on whichever realm you choose to test. Was it too crowded, even for a launch day experience? Did it feel too empty or too crowded after you moved to the second zone? We’ll have a dedicated feedback thread for you here in this forum tomorrow, once the stress test has begun. Please give us details about your experience when you submit feedback to that thread, especially which realm you tested.  
---
&gt;Thank you very much!
---
Relevant part of the post \^
---
You've never played WoW if you think getting the perfect UI with all the addons you want takes mere minutes. And sure, macros can be written offline, but they can't be tested, and you'll still have to copy paste them all individually.
---
Exactly, and people have the impression that minmax raid build is the only way to have fun.
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
---
I leveled like.. six Paladins between vanilla and the end of wrath. Even when wrath’s changes came through and seals stayed up through judgment, the number one best moment was always hitting level 51 and getting CS. The class feels broken without it.
---
I don’t know why you compare CS to seals/judgments anyway. At best they work together, at worst neither takes anything from the other.
---
Arcane Intellect(Rank 3) - 520 Mana
---
Power Word: Fortitude(Rank 3) - 400 Mana
---
Mark of The Wild(Rank 3) - 100 Mana
---
Ever wonder why every Druid you ever run by seems so much nicer than Mages or sometimes Priests? These mana costs on our respective buffs might be part of the reason why. Another thing to consider is that Priests generally don't use much mana grinding with the OP wand + SW:P combo, so really the class to not judge for scarcity of ally buffing is Mage. It really does cost a lot and we generally get asked 40 times an hour if we can make someone water / food also.
---
Thanks for not training new mobs into our AOE packs!!

---
Personally I found ret to be far more valuable, and reckoning protection was about as good with a two-hander. 
---
Basically, you won't always have a good reason to heal, so you'll want some damage to fill in the gaps. Your other abilities, like Blessing of Freedom/Protection/Sacrifice, are your most valuable tools in PvP, so get the guardian's favor talent and as far as the rest, any spec can heal just fine for PvP at any level. Regardless of spec, don't skimp on spellpower like some ret paladins do.
---
Me too.
---
Where u put ur keys when you get home to play wow
---
If it's like vanilla, the casual guilds will be desperate for healers to fill a 40-man raid and will take boomkins and ret paladins . . . as healers. No respec required, but get out your healing gear.
---
Except the healing specs of hybrid classes have most/all of the utility and are competent healers.
---
ye that's basically stealing :D
---
Counter thoughts:
---
&gt;People say it is trash mainly because of the 5 second rule
---
Hots are trash because if you are leaving someone below max to let your renew tick then another healer might not notice it and just heal them to full.  I do like renew in 5 mans, but I typically just use it if I have to move and want to be time-efficient, or after the pull to top off while moving to the next.
---
&gt;let the tanks health fall into range where you can use Greater Heal 5 without over healing
---
I strongly disagree with this.  If you keep everyone as close to full as possible then there is less likely to be deaths.  It should go without saying that you have to consider the 5 second rule, but if a tank is even 2000 hp below max then someone should already have a heal in progress.
---
Bear in mind a parry into crush is always possible.  We all saw this kill tanks on many occasions.  If the tank dying causes a wipe then that's a lot of time wasted.
---
&gt;Downranking starts to make sense here
---
I first started down-ranking in Sunken Temple.  I wouldn't have had any +healing gear at the time (early patch, low level).  It wasn't just about the efficiency of the heal, it was about keeping people topped up without over-healing.
---
&gt;Lesser Heal 1 is now almost identical to Greater Heal
---
It's just too little healing per second.  I once tested spamming &lt;150 hps heals on my druid in vanilla and it wasn't at all effective (vs one of the green dragons).
---
So. Many. Shitty. Memes.
---
I think he bored the player to death by running back to his lifeless toon's body countless times just so he can run back again.
---
Well that answer would be 3...
---
This f'd with my emotions so hard :( Thought I got into beta.
---
1.  Majority of private server players will readily admit the client is not perfect.  Some servers intentionally changed values and had QoL perks like 90% reduced respec costs and the ability to queue for BGs from any location in the world to stopping xp rate or changing to x? value.
---
2.  Classic atm is not a true representation of Vanilla.  Frankly, it never will be because it is being emulated using a different client than Vanilla.  It's just an "official" private server.
---
One of the things I loved the most about private servers. Banning players for griefing hunters on their epic quest.
---
Yes, you understand the joke.
---
Yeah, that's the thing. In Classic, reputation matters, both for players and guilds (and any organized non-guild raid groups, which were more a thing back then).
---
###WHAT
---
No. He is just the professional crier for everyone on every server.

Problem is everything in mmos and life in general, is they tends to always head towards specialization at some point in time, why be a hybrid that can tank and dps, when you can just be full tank, who takes much less damage and is easier for healers to heal. Why have someone be a support hybrid when they can just be full support and provide more utility in the long run than they would as a hybrid support that also dps.
---
Well, except for the 60 hours a month spent farming. So yea should probably just pay the $15.
---
It's the best part of WSG too. Spending 15-20 minutes just to even locate and chase the FC was so much fun. Ugh can't wait.
---
Make your 15th character yourself IRL and go outside for abit. Dear god this is a lot of time in wow leveling
---
Yeah but you'd treat that as a fresh threat build - taunt just made it easier.
---
Dude let's run Princess Fatbitch
---
NO WE ARE RUNNING FUCKING MARAUDON
---
I'll show myself out.
---
You've never done all of BRM in one day? Huh...
---
You're trash ked.
---
You say that it's not about raiding which is true, but I disagree that it's about the amount of hours spent leveling. Even my first character I spent hundreds and hundreds more hours in end game playing pvp farming and raiding then I ever did leveling my first character.  
---
I think you are minimizing raiding because people are over stressing min maxing, but I just feel like you're doing the complete opposite. A very large chunk of the game IS raiding. Vanilla is also the time that raiding is most rewarding. Raid gear out paces pvp gear eventually and there are lots of items that don't have a pvp reward equivalent. The gear gap between 5 man content and raid content is also at its largest in vanilla.
---
  
---
IMO you are underplaying raiding because people overstress min maxing for raiding, but to me you're doing exactly what they are doing just the other side of the coin.
---
Staff is better. There is a grey vendor trash staff ( like req lvl 2) that can drop, and with rockbiter you can global things with autoattack  +earth shock.
---
Wait there are fellow FreeFolk here ! 
---

---
Why are you getting mad about there not being an RPPVP server for a *stress test*?
---
It’s absolutely stupid to get so up in arms over what isn’t even a release realm list.
---
Keep in mind this is 21 servers for the NA region. EU doesn't get to participate in the stress test cause fuck em. More servers worldwide is my point I guess.
---
The picture don’t really do it justice.
---
60 hours? Nah. Even the worst farmer can make 10k gold per hour on Retail. That's 12 hours a month.
---
Still 100% torn between troll shaman and NE druid. Things like these tip the scale
---
It's best to just play Classic and find the class you enjoy as you go.  It's all part of the experience.
---
&gt;What's your plan/strategy going to be?
---
To quote Ron Swanson:
---
&gt;Blueprints for the future are a fools errand. They’re like blueprints for a house. Nice to have but any foreman with half a brain doesn’t need to look at ’em. One day this year or maybe the next you’re gonna be somewhere else, so enjoy yourself now.
---
You're breathtaking.
---
I played hunter exclusively in vanilla, and had a lot of success in pvp and pve with him. I didn’t make it into AQ or naxx, but did farm MC quite a bit and even managed to clear most of BWL. I was mainly a pvp player though so I think that’s pretty decent would like to switch up a bit this time around.  So with all that in mind what do you think I should roll with rogue or warrior? I’m not really interested in playing a hybrid class as I suffered through BC with an ele shaman lol
---
False. You can't /camp and go to the start of the instance like in Pservers. DM runs will be extremely inefficient, especially lasher farming.
---
I supposed I overstated by saying that I hate them. It's more like it's fun to hate on them rather than hate them directly. And killing them is fun; I like how they die. I'm glad that they're an alliance race and that I have the opportunity to hunt them.
---
I mean, complaining about getting downvoted is basically just asking people to downvote you more.
---
You right. The thing is, all this info is readily available to the players who care to look it up, as I'm sure you have found.
---
At the end of the day, maybe I'm just sick of reading the same arguments about ret paladins and druids in this sub every 10th post.
---
Very cool
---
It definitely is if I'm going for a world first Rag kill! 
---
It's partly to Save on respect costs and the hassle of it. That, and not having to juggle different gear sets. Also lets me level as one spec and enjoy that experience, then level as another spec of same class and enjoy that leveling experience. With only one shaman I can only go from 1-60 once.   
---
Separate characters also let me try out different class/race combination and have a priest on alliance and another on horde.   
---
   
---
I'm in no rush, playing the long game. I can bench the double ups as pure crafting characters after 60 if I don't need more than one of a class. It also lets me leave characters in different locations for farming, so I don't have to run between raiding zone and farming zone.  
---
but yes, you're absolutely right.    
---
It is silly as fuck! I also expect it to be a lot of fun for many years to come, I want to savour this experience and make it last.
---
Under "Version" you have to choose "World of Warcraft Classic" rather than "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic". I'm seeing only 10 realms right now so it might be fluctuating as Blizz prepares for tomorrow.
---
Yeah, mine is the same as the second guys, it's in live. And I checked it out, I could log on and see the realms there were 16 of them Rp, pvp and pve but all were offline, so I'm thinking stress? But idk so confusing
---
The absolute best rage quit I've ever seen is at level 30 this warrior went through all the trouble of acquiring my help to get their WW Axe early, and after getting it tried to pull two same level mobs in Arathi and died. I helped them with their quest, even buying the Crests off the AH for them, and friended them in case they had any questions. But after they Alt+F4'd that day I never saw them online again.
---
*Oh no, some people are having fun a different way than I am. I must call them out on reddit, because only MY WAY of having fun is the legitimate way.*

Do you mean DnD or WoW because I was mostly talking DnD but I agree with you on both.
---
Classic CD  is a hell of a drug.
---
What are your plans for release, are you going to be hard out on one character and going for fast progression, or a bit more variety?
---
I always hear PTO being used as vacation and sick leave for being sick. Going just by name sick leave is paid time off though.
---
You can farm gold efficiently enough to make having two characters of the same class to save on respec costs never worth it.
---
Yeah i think if you had full beta you would be able to get into the servers.
---
So i guess you got a stresstest for tomorrow on accident.
---
Deadmines was DM for months before Dire Maul even existed.
---
Dont worry about it bro 
---
Tanking isnt even hard.
---
&gt;Did it feel too empty or too crowded after you moved to the second zone? 
---
Sounds like they're specifically testing what some servers look like with layering off/reduced outside of the starting areas.
---
Big if true
---
Would buy it.
---
Pretty sure I'm just gonna level a Mage and a Warrior.  Get in all the dungeons on both before the player base gets too high to consistently run them.  All other character slots become bank/AH alts.  Maybe a 40+ lock for guild summons because that shit is pimp on PvP servers.  You get 10 slots, make the most of them!
---
Awesome mace, and not difficult too obtain after a few AV weekends. 
---
Shamans get so much from AV.
---
This person has taken it up a level!
---
(More puns to follow I hope)
---
&gt;Bad for those of us who tested out 1-5, 5-10, and now want to fine tune 10-15 details.
---
The purpose of the stress test isn't for you to fine tune your 10-15 details.
---
What?  Pservers have lower parry and dodge rates than classic, particularly for enemies higher level than you.
---
Yeah I had that issue with hunter but luckily I had a good social group and guild that were more than happy to take me along. I think I’ll be doing the same, I remember warriors just getting better and better as they got geared. I was never very wary of rogues unless they had a tremendous gear advantage which was pretty rare since I had pretty nice gear
---
Yeah I think so also, and even so that's still confusing, I thought it would have beta &amp; stress test at the end
---
Yup. Fuck playing an Alliance warlock on a PvP server.
---
I only play holy priests all the time. Every server or private server from level 1-60 and through the raidcontent.
---
Its not because i like to rush things i just cant stand other classes and specs in wow. 
---
So i will gain more speed through only one class but be slower because holy questing takes some time :p
---
I would ask the support staff and be like what's going on but you know how helpful they are
---
Iirc you can stash the item in your bank, drop the quest, and keep whacking

Ladies and gentlemen, our public education system at work

What are you talking about? In TBC there was only one good PvP trinket - "the" PvP Trinket. The battlemaster's trinkets were trash. Any good PvP template had to use a raid trinket. I didn't really do much PvP during WOTLK (tried s5, hated it), so it could have gotten worse, but it was definitely already a problem in TBC.
---
The point is that it is humorous in a way to complain about PvP gear sometimes being good in PvE, when PvPers ALWAYS needed to raid to get at least trinkets for their template (and of course s4 is well-known for 4/5 4/8 glaive rogues).

Current season epics from arena points, and last season epics from honor points was where the term "welfare epics" originated back in BC.
---
At least the current season gear was partially locked behind rating requirements, but you could get it off 2s which is obviously a joke.
---
&gt;Hots are trash because if you are leaving someone below max to let your renew tick then another healer might not notice it and just heal them to full.  I do like renew in 5 mans, but I typically just use it if I have to move and want to be time-efficient, or after the pull to top off while moving to the next.
---
Now this is interesting to me as someone who will be getting into healing for the first time. From what I've understood, in retail Hots are not considered trash and weren't even when I last played (WotLK). Is this based on vanilla experience on people not noticing the hots, and might they be more viable, just say because people are better players today and might be paying attention to them?
---
I totally agree, I was just quoting Bobby B.  I found the joke stretcher but I don’t think I did a great job.  
---
T_T
---
&gt; Combat rez, innervate priest. That's raiding as a Druid.
---
This might have been true in vanilla but isn't true anymore.  Druids are capable of topping healing charts if they know what they're doing.
---
No, he's saying the diagram doesn't make sense and you probably meant to use a pie chart.
---
I don't know.  OP said "every class can raid".  Who am I supposed to believe?   /s
---
I was thinking more DnD, but its true in WoW too.
---
Stealth is rarely used in group PvE.
---
I don't have to play any particular number of hours a day, it'll just take long time.
---
but yes, I will be playing a lot of hours a day. At least for the first few months.
---
I'll make sure to go for a run or something between dungeons, or at specific level milestones. Think that'd be good for all of us.
---
What about yourself, what are your plans and what are you looking forward to most in the game?
---
Thats literally the expansion the term originated in you dolt.
---
Im not talking about resilience. I mean needing to do bgs and arena to get gear and actually feeling good when you get gear thru rating is good. The current systems are all garbage. RNG bs
---
This isn't anything new. People are wanting RP-PVP realms
---
Back in 06 it was always DM for me.
---
I like this plan, letting things be spontaneous and seeing what happens.That's how I approached the game a decade ago when I first started. Good times!
---
Obviously this doesn't confirm anything 100%, but it caught my eye so I thought I'd share it with you all!
---
&gt;What server you on?
---
&gt;Zuljin
---
&gt;(server transfers all characters spending hundreds of dollars)
---
&gt;...I meant classic zuljin.

oh really? welp thats my bad
---
Ret man bad.
---
Yep, I suspected this would eventually be the case as it solves the resource issue. There will be very few people at higher levels, there needs only be a single layer for higher level zones.
---
Maybe. But I really hope this doesn't end up with them letting servers have 5000+ just because the vast majority of people here played private servers and that's how it was.
---
Someone tell me which servers the streamers are going to be on. I don't want this stress test ruined by them.     
---
^^^^^/s
---
You say that now until i come into your raid a 51/0/0 mage
---
I would also add here that depending on the level of raid you want to do you can play whatever. MC is a joke of a raid by nonvanilla standards. There will be casual guilds that run MC with all sorts of "inappropriate " specs e.g shadow priests, elemental druids, etc.

**Community:** Everyone outside of the guild that has joined The Horde (multi-guild alliance) and has interaction access to our guild, and vice versa!
---
**Casual:** Requirements: None, plays for fun
---
**RT: Sat/Sun 8-10 PM CST (If we get enough for a 40 man raid team)**
---
**Casual+:** Casuals who want to apply themselves to the guild by way of farming resources, maxing out a profession etc
---
**Progression/Semi Hardcore:** Requirements: Wants to raid, and applies themselves to farming/BiS grind to a progression extent, and understands that this is not BFA.
---
**RT: Wednesday, 6-8 CST (Until AQ, then Longer/more days)**
---
**Hardcore:** Requirements: Players who want BiS, apply themselves more than any other and want a fast paced Raid Team
---
(Combining hardcore with progression until we get enough to make just a Hardcore Raid Team to accommodate a Faster Pace/Realm First try)
---
**PVP:** Duh

Because it's layered, players who find themselves changed don't have to leave the guild to join a guild that is their new playstyle because we cater to all playstyles, and because we are apart of The Horde, should their raid times change they don't have to leave their friends, they just join a different Horde, and stay in the same community.

Trying to convince my roommate to join me on the journey, but he’s never played an mmorpg and seems hesitant yet intrigued. How do I sway him? I have trouble encapsulating the greatness in a concise manner.
---
Hard to enjoy when half the fights cut to a Priest walking emoly in Duskwood.
---
I’m going to take it at whatever pace it comes, stop and smell the roses when I can, and aim for 3 level 60s at most
---
pretty much yeah, i could raid log or do mythic + but mythic plus does not interest me i did them in legion and hated them after a week whats fun or interesting about mythic +?, raiding i just don't have any desire to log in for gear i don't need for anything but more raiding that i only do once a week for a few hours.  
---
the fact that the content was easy had little to do with why i did it, it was just the easiest to access content had this content held my interest i might have been interested in doing more. i think they're trying to make the world more difficult gradually but right now its still really boring.
---
He described it correctly.
---
not sure if /r/assholedesign or r/dataisugly
---
Why are they all offline ?
---
I’m not an RPer, but RP realms sound great to me.
---
You say that now until I come into your raid 47/4/0 mage
---
I wish I could upvote you more then once ;)
---
Bitch!
---
I will support this!
---
I want to tank so the game has decided on warrior for me.
---
Dartol's Rod would probably be RP-PvP
---
Bfa is a worse game in every aspect except graphics so when you make a meme like that on a CLASSIC WOW sub dont be surprised when you get downvoted
---
Position in Queue: 1,209
---
It disappeared cause you uninstalled. I still have beta installed and it’s still their in my dropdown. However the play button is greyed out like OP.
---
So if you get access I am guessing the play button will illuminate.
---
Well since its the community that is voting on what feels best, I would doubt we end up with that many people. I recall Mark Kern talking about how each realm was designed for \~1000 people or so, concurrently connected.
---
Yes, 37% of the Horde.
---
Dale of North (36.68% Undead):
---
* 225,811 Orc
---
* 287,290 Undead
---
* 129,937 Tauren
---
* 140,162 Troll
---
Bringer of Light (38.12% Undead):
---
* 405,518 Orc
---
* 582,267 Undead
---
* 269,693 Tauren
---
* 270,048 Troll
---
Together, it's 37.63% Undead.
---
Provide me with something to respond to. Refer back to my 3 quote comment.
---
That’s kickass!! I’m from PA too. :)
---
&gt; You’re remembering it wrong or your guild was trash.
---
You sound like every other wannabe big dick raider who talks big but rarely stayed in the same guild long enough to be remembered.
---
I don't need to talk tough to feel good.  I know what my accomplishments were without needing to play pretend on reddit.
---
 The only stat I know for sure is that less than 1% ever killed a boss in Naxx. From my experance, I would say maybe 40-50% of people who got to 60 ran MC, and maybe 5-10% ran BW by 1.12. Maybe 3-4 guilds on a typical server did AQ
---
Its walk vs run. Not even a speed run. But wouldnt you rather a 1hr raid vs a 3 hour raid?
---
&gt; unless you needed +hit or +mp5
---
Oh so you know, all the DPS and all the healers.
---
You filled in gaps with PvP gear.  The problem was that it made being geared *enough* to clear raid content much easier, not that it was *better* in every way.  Sure, there was that PvP guild that went and cleared BT in basically full PvP gear, but all that ever said to me was that dedicated PvPers are just better players overall than dedicated PvErs.
---
And the people that tried arguing that S4 weps were better than Glaives for PvE, fucking lol.  Half the fucking bosses between Sunwell/BT/Hyjal were goddamn demons.
---
Yeah, I understand yours, and many others, frustration. The first time I tested, after I finally did get in, I had uninterrupted play time, no DCs, but I was in EK.
---
I disagree. Vanilla has the most time consuming leveling of all WoW xpacs and if I personally hated reaching lvl 60 14 years ago, only to learn that my dreams of playing a feral druid in raids was never going to happen.
---
I wish someone experienced enough had warned me about the hybrid tax and the poor viability of my spec of choice before I commited so many months into it, so my raiding experience 14 years ago would have been lot more enjoyable as well as my overall vanilla experience.
---
If a newcomer to the vanilla balance asks if he's gonna have success as a ret paladin in Classic because it's currently his favorite class on retail, and you don't warn him that it's a build that performs poorly in vanilla, chances are he'll just end up frustrated by his choice once he reaches lvl 60, disguted by the low demand of ret paladins after maybe two months of leveling for naught and just quit the game entirely.
---
I experienced it. I know how it feels. For 5 years I've wished I clicked the warrior icon instead. I wanted to be the main tank in raids so bad. I felt like I "made the wrong choice" until the WotLK balance gave hybrids some love.
---
If you keep it installed and are able to click play you will have access. As is right now you don’t have access. If you uninstall it it will go away.
---
He described what you intended to say, not what the chart says. Hence why he says suggest other charts that would describe what you intended.
---
Apparently Saudi Arabia is easy mode, too.
---
Right on! Northeast Philly here :)
---
id rather wait 10 minutes for a local bg that be forced to play with 300 ping against people who have under 50 ping
---
i just realized they're color coded for difficulty
---
Where's my group?  Levels fast until 33 and then doesn't level for a month because of STV PvP?
---
The first time I rolled horde I rolled up to Redridge as a level 17 warrior and started ganking.  Most of the people I fought where higher level than I.
---
Its a nice device but to expensive for what it offers
---
That's one thing I find so enjoyable about warrior, the highs are truly euphoric, going from some shit 2h to WW for example is such a huge leap you feel like a god.
---
Fortunately that didn't exist until Wrath.
---
Yeah man. I met humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves. Then when I went horde I met Orcs, trolls, Tauren and undead. The only people you’ll meet in real life will be humans and sometimes dwarves.
---
Yes, you'll have plenty of raid slots.  However, you may have trouble getting 5 man groups if you won't tank.  As a tank, I generally avoided bringing another warrior along to roll on my gear.
---
Jesus fucking Christ
---
&gt;There was serious talk about if the warglaves were even better than s4 weapons.
---
No, there was not. Put the fucking crack pipe down. 4/5 4/8 glaive was the dominant meta in s4 and the proc didn't even do anything in PvP. It was absolutely the hottest shit on the market. Stop fucking bullshitting it makes you look like an idiot.
---
We already know that Blizz is planning on having RP servers for Classic from an interview with Ion 3 months ago.
---
&gt;Ion: I think, yeah, I think our current plan is to have RP realms certainly in the larger regions, uhm, where we have a range of realm types. I don't think we're currently planning on any RP-PVP realms in particular, because that's maybe a bit too small of a niche... but, we'll see how Classic unfolds once it's out there and certainly if, you know, there's a large population and demand for that server, for that type of server, that could support it, we'd be open to adding it. But, I think at the start, we'll have RP as an available server type.
---
because paladins were badass in wc2 and wc3, so people expect more.
---
What a fucking ripoff
---
(( ))
---
Two overlapping circles drawn close enough together will resemble a single circle.  Unlike in math, the inner set of parenthesis are not actually the same set.  The left ( and the lef ) are one circle, and the right ( and the right ) are the other.  At least  I believe that is what OP is trying to illustrate.  
---
I still have no fucking idea what all those lines and labels really mean though since there are four and there should only be three.  Unless there are four circles there, in which case we're still missing the label on the middle area.
---
Love it
---
It’s okay to play City if Evil stuff too. It doesn’t have to be sounding the seventh trumpet or waking the fallen only.
---
i gotta spike my hair and dye it jet black
---
Tell me how your Vael attempts go with Oomkins and Ret pallies in blues champ.
---
Correct. The purpose of the stress test is to setup all your system settings, addons, keybinds, custom cvars, and macros so you won't have to at launch!
---
There isn't an add-on out there that can alter the core stories of the game into trite garbage or grant you the ability to fly.
---
this isn't authentic classic!
---
I haven't played since wod, but from wrath til then they were better for a couple reasons:
---
1) hots are significantly more Mana efficient in later expansions so it's still worth it even if you over heal
---
2) there is a lot of raid damage that can be healed up through hots
---
3) Mana isn't as big of an issue compared to hps (though you can certainly still go oom, especially early in a raid tier)
---
And Horde Malfurion
---
GET OUT OF MY HEAD
---
&gt; but if a tank is even 2000 hp below max then someone should already have a heal in progress.
---
You can always have a heal in progress. The 5 second rule doesn't kick in until your cast goes off, so you can have "one in the chamber" and just cancel it if it turns out you don't need it.
---
They generate threat better, actually.
---
Same here my guild was in the top few for progression and I was out dpsing everyone with arena gear easy a couple locks parts like hte shoulders were awesome
---
Rebind ASD to more useful things. You might want to have a key to move backward bound somewhere else, but just about every movement can be accomplished by mouse turning and strafing. I swapped my strafe keys to A and D, used Q for grounding totem, S for lightning shield, and E for earth shock. 
---
You said you have small hands in a few other comments, so what you can do instead is use a programming language like AutoHotkey to make regular keys into modifiers. For example, you could rebind the "foward" and "back" buttons on a mouse to "ctrl" and "alt", and suddenly you have a boatload of extra keys to work with. 
---
You can learn how to do that in AutoHotkey in about 10 minutes, or 20 with little computering experience. Autohotkey's website has a list of key names, and setting up hotkeys is as simple as this:
---
XButton1::LCtrl
---
XButton2::LAlt
---
return
---
Paste that into notepad, save it as a .ahk file, and if you have autohotkey intalled, that'll make your forward/backward mouse buttons into modifiers.
---
Troll master race!
---
The most overplayed hybrid that comes immediately to mind were the prot/holy paladins in early WotLK. They excelled in PvP, and were actually very useful in PvE as well.
---
Dethecus-Classic.

Athene OP
---
I’m interested in servers based off of he bronze dragon flight to fit the back in time theme. It would also be cool to do nostalgic places from vanilla as names too.
---
This is SOLID advice not only for WoW but also for life.
---
You forgot In Flames 😣
---
How do I check this??
---
MMOs and gaming in general recently have a huge problem with community perception. Some well-known person says X should be done one way or Y is trash and that notion spreads like wildfire throughout the community. I'm pretty over it tbh, like I don't understand why people think that they're going to play at the level the 0.1% play the game when they're really just an average player or why people can't just figure things out themselves. Most people on this sub discuss builds, BiS, and classes in general like they're already heading into Naxxramas, when in reality they probably won't even step inside UBRS. This is the kind of behavior that leads to pugs reserving items from dungeons as low as level 20, which is fucking ridiculous. 
---
This obsession over playing at the top 1% of all players is absolute nonsense in Classic. For real. People are talking about parses and logs and shit on raid bosses like this is retail, where literally that is the only thing you have to focus on because there's nothing else to the game. Vanilla WoW you just don't play a spec and look at meters, you have to know how to play the entire class and do shit moment to moment that's good for the group: CC, Buff, Heal, Damage, Taunt etc. This comes with the realization that if you play a hybrid class you will most likely need to learn how to heal, same with warriors needing to know how to tank, priests who play shadow also need to know how to heal, everyone needs to know when and how to CC, the list goes on and this is what I mean by playing your entire class and not just your spec. You have to accept the fact that yeah, maybe you won't get to hammer-smash-face the entire time you play this class, but the group will love you and want to play with you more and more if you know how to do everything your class has to offer. That's probably the most important thing anyone should take away from this: Pick a class you enjoy and learn the shit out of it.  
---
I know people are going to take the first sentence of that last paragraph out of context, so let me explain: You can still be a really good player without all the stress of spending countless hours and gold on getting BiS and consumables for everything you do. If you want to do all of that, fine, that's not a problem and more power to you, but you really don't have to to succeed in this game at all. If you find yourself getting stressed out over this shit, then don't do it, because you will severely cripple your enjoyment of the game and I would like everyone to enjoy their time in Classic as much as possible. 
---
The people who tell you that you're not going to be able to do anything unless you min-max your life away are absolutely wrong and are literally a plague on the community. You can accomplish anything you want to do in the game as long as you know your class and have the determination to keep going.
---
Which we will see a lot less of with the city buff cooldown. Will chnage the meta to favour rogue meter probably
---
Cropping Poison lasts 12 seconds, freezing trap lasts 10. They can just sprint and then reapply. 
---
Also, I never played Beast Mastery, so all that pet shit doesn’t really apply to me. I can see how BM would be more useful in 1v1 against certain classes, but I just hate it so much. I played hunter back when MM was the only viable spec and never really got into either of the other two. 
---
I’ve never really met a Paladin that runs out of mana. I will burn myself casting Viper Sting over and over again and have done no damage. They almost always outlast me. 
---
Warrior is one class that can be beaten on a somewhat consistent basis, but the point I was making isn’t really about that. OP said he can beat every class in 1v1 as a hunter and I just find that very, very difficult to believe.
---
I always thought it was ”something NEED doing”?
---
I hope they implement this change by default. The AV stress test was crazy blown out in the snowy areas due to the glow. The console command made it so much better.
---
Renew is still trash in BFA retail.
---
Other class's hots benefit from class mechanics to make them viable.  For druids every hot on a target increases their healing via their mastery, for shamans casting your hot gives you haste or crit buff on the next channeled heal, and for monks their hot is smart heal that will travel if they person healed is at 100% hp.  So for those classes even when you don't need the hot for the healing it is worth casting it for the secondary effect.  
---
On top of that hots in vanilla do not get affected by haste(well there is almost none in vanilla anyways), crit, and scale somewhat poorly with spell power.  Also at some point in retail they made it so that hots and dots have an upfront tick the moment you cast the spell.
---
And then, blizzard made a concerted effort in TBC and later expansions to make hots better in general so classes like druid could primarily heal with their "class fantasy" of hots, so almost all hots got an efficiency increase with the expectation that some of each hot will be lost to overhealing.
---
I don't think there is a way, unfortunately
---
It just says "Idiot", what's this got to do with Classic?
---
Ya mon!
---
I cant read.
---
anyone that read all that want to tell me what it said?
---
Wow, the amount of stupidity on these forums in breathtaking. All hots are trash because other healers might not notice? Somehow these forums are more ill-informed than the original wow forums, before people knew how to play the game.
---
Nah. Will be listening to Sabaton.
---
Sentient boi

Lmao imagine getting an actual license plate with the wrong abbreviations on it. This has got to be the biggest yikes I’ve ever seen in regards to the whole DM VC thing.

No it's definitely Millhouse Manastorm

pretty sure there wont be, they said they will use all new names

Wow classic can’t ruin your social life if you don’t have a social life. 🤷‍♀️
---
And a lot of the dwarves are angry as fuck in real life
---
Yeah, I had been messing around with a Druid on a  server. 
---
It is a super fun class to play, but the fact that your car and bear always look the same and weapons are just star sticks was kind of a let down. 
---
Big bad ass weapons and cool looking armor are just a big part of this game for a lot of people.
---
I heard it was only US. But im in EU and I got to download Classic to.
---
I didnt start raiding until wow was well over a year old but I never farmed consumes for reids.  We got halfway through Naxx without going as hardcore as people say you need to (such as collecting all the world bluffs, like who the fuck has time for that just to save 10 minutes in the raid)

Wha... what? Are you looking for the man who killed your father?

Well that is great news then!

Mmmmmmhmmmmm
---
that has everything to do with OPs post
---
OP: do people just prioritise and click on the rest?
---
that guy: You shouldn't (promote) click(ing).
---
Seconded. But I’ll take a hard pass on the alcohol and stick with some good ol’ weed. Cheers
---
Nowadays theres a lot more constant raid dmg, hots are great here.
---
I mean, I've always understood that. I still want to know what the general consensus on various thing's viability are when it comes to raiding, because raiding is the main content where my choices are going to strongly affect other people. They affect others in 5 mans sure, but 5 mans can be done with most things. Of course I want to know what is good or bad in a raiding sense, because that's the thing that guilds build their communities around, because that's the main content where you actually see each other and play together. If your focus is PvE of course.
---
Although I have played a little on private servers, my play there was heavily influenced by how I played retail vanilla.  Most of my memories are from the original.
---
Think of it this way: If the damage that dps take is so predictable that you could just heal with renew then it's so easy that you could be healing with anything.  If the damage isn't that predictable then someone is going to try to heal them to full.
---
You're not using renew on tanks because your tank healers are pre-casting their heals.  The only time that renew is going to tick is if the tank healer cancels their cast because the tank is at 95%.  In which case your renew tick might heal the tank to full, but then the tank healer will probably just over-heal more on their next cast.
---
It is worth noting that we ran very healer heavy, as most guilds did back then.  Perhaps Hots will be better with less healers in the raid.
---
Unless the set bonus is amazing, it's best to mix and match for the best stats.
---
True
---
The game literally launched without a single raid.
---
Man shut the fuck up. Vanilla wow is about whatever you want it to be. Stop crying because people will level fast
---
The joke was supposed to be that pretty much everyone who rushes to 60 is a corpse camper. Sorry, apparently I did a very poor job conveying that. :(
---
Nope, this is not a bug. This is the updated b.net client. Regardless of whether you have Stress Test option, you have the ability to Install Classic and see the realm list.
---
Thanks dad.
---
I actually think more locks will be avoiding fearward this time around. Just imo though
---
able to get to server list and everything just no servers
---
Mana efficiency on heals is not the only factor.
---
If you had an instant cast heal that only took 1 mana but healed 100 hp then it would still be a garbage heal because you would need to cast it 5 times and wait for 5 GCD to heal the damage from 1 hit, and by that time the tank would have taken another 3 hits.
---
You are going to get kicked from raids if you just spam lesser healing, even with +700 healing power, because your HPS will be garbage and your tanks will die.
---
That’s fair enough, I can see the appeal in hunting down the little gnomes about.
---
The real benefit of the stress, optimistic about having Blizzard think about what is the best solution instead of going with the easy answer

---
I am going to make my main and play on that until my friends go to bed and then i will make a level 10 bank alt to camp in Stormwind with Leatherworking and Enchanting.
---
I hope they fix this or we are going to see Holy priests soloing Naxx.
---
It is absolutely not a pserver thing at all.  A lot of us lived Vanilla as a hybrid or non-dps class and we understand the struggle of finding and keeping a raid group.
---
As others have mentioned, casual guilds tend to have far more problems, not just because of loot drama.  It's a lot harder to keep top tier players in a "casual" guild, and things like your tank getting poached happens a lot more in casual guilds than in "hardcore" raiding guilds.  But also there's a lot more meter drama too.
---
That guy just saved your life. You can 100% tank as any spec until at least the 50s

My bullshit? The guy was starting pointless arguments all along this thread, spreading BS about leveling times. Yeah I'm not enough of a nerd to actually give a shit, but it was a little annoying how arrogant he was talking. You coming at me when it has nothing to do with you, and questioning my financial status because I don't want to give a handout to some bum, is ridiculous. Cya.
---
Yea I'm not playing classic I knew Blizzard would pull some shit
---
&gt; iirc spell batching in retail has a much shorter "tick" duration.
---
Retail basically processes everything as quickly as possible now, resulting in 1-10ms "batches":

Literally unrelated.
---
Your problem will be gearing up for raids. You will need to run 5 mans to gear up and almost every warrior tank will exclude other warriors from the group.
---
I've already reserved vacation days from 8/27 - 8/30. Problem solved!
---
&gt; turns out when bosses have less mechanics than the average normal dungeon nowadays
---
This can't be stated enough. A post cata raid boss for a dps is more challenging on a player mechanically than any raid boss in vanilla. Even some of the simple ones, I remember first tier legion there was the bear boss, you had to constantly move the boss around the room due to lava on the floor expanding, move out with debuff or move between boss and player with debuff, swap what side of the boss you were on so you didn't get charged through multiple times in a row. On top of having to press at least 3+ buttons for your dps priority.
---
That was one of the easier bosses.
---
+1. On all counts. It's undeniable that the player who raided and PvP'd had a small leg up on players who only raided. But you can tell who in this thread is simply playing "the telephone game" and repeating what they thought they heard rather than actually experiencing it. There's so much absurd wild hyperbole because people want to rant and rave against the fact that PvP gear in TBC existed and they're salty dogs who hate the idea that a player who is better than them at PvP has better gear than them. It's that simple. They twist and turn and contort themselves every which way to try to justify why it is okay for them to be mad at the system rather than accepting they're just salty dogs. 
---
Also the glaive comment was absurdly hilarious. Dude is on crack.
---
as someone who played an alliance warlock on pvp servers until wrath i can only say that if i were to do it all over again i would roll orc 1000%. UD doesnt help warlocks as you can self dispel or trinket fears and cannibalism is only useful for leveling. if you check the population's census of basically every private server you will see that alliance warlock is the least played class/race combo next to druid so WOTF is not gonna be helping you most of the time whilst rogue and warrior are the two most popular classes to play. Stuns kill warlocks in vanilla and orc is the only way to get a chance to counter them.
---
That's not what people are talking about though.  People are specifically talking about one character playing multiple roles at the same time in PVE.  Obviously every shaman, paladin, druid always plays hybrid in PVP.
---
If you're on a PvP server, that's how it goes. That's the whole point of STV! First zone horde and alliance clash! If you don't like being killed while questing, roll PvE. There is a simple solution to your problem and bitching about PvPers engaging in PvP isn't going to solve it.
---
Played since classic. Shaman, Mage, Hunter. I was jealous on warlocks forever, but never played one myself. So ... now Im going to play a female UD Warlock with the perfect jump animation.
---
Even with rested XP (which is 100% bonus to monster xp right?) i assume its gonna take a long ass time to do this. Did you do any calculations on how long itll take?
---
There should only be two labels (one for each circle), the overlaid section should be able to be inferred by the other two labels as it's the union of both.
---
Yes, but in the example, the 5 good tanks are 5 in 100 of all Warriors.  
---
That means, in the example, 5% of all Warrior are good tanks and 1% of all warriors get TF.
---
The list is obviously not accurate and is simply used to illustrate the point that very few of the people rolling a Warrior will ever get to 60, bother tanking, succeed and get TF.
---
Hey! Really nice job, but I noticed something I'd like to highlight.
---
When playing around as a warlock I noticed that it suggested 2 pieces of bloodvine for a few of the phases. However, if one would manually change the leggings it suggest into the bloodvine leggings it triggers the 3 piece set bonus (2% crit) and gives a higher total EP than with the currently recommended legs.
---
Is this as intentional? My own interpretation of it is that it says that it is better to have the whole set in that case. (Do not that I have everything checked in when auto-filling the set, as I was simply curious to find the absolute BIS for each phase)
---
&gt; OP: do people just prioritise and click on the rest?
---
The answer is yes. A vast amount of people, dare I say the majority of people, only use key binds for their most important abilities and then click on everything else.
---
And that is perfectly fine. There is nothing wrong with clicking.
---
In vanilla? That wasn't my experience but perhaps we just had bad Druids lol
---
&gt;undocumented servers
---
Bruh 😂
---
Are you taking into consideration the downranking penalty on Lesser Heal because it’s learned before L20?
---
Overall, the thing people miss most-often is that successful healing isn’t about overhealing or efficiency, it’s about finishing the fight with nobody dying. One of the corollaries to that is a fight where you don’t use all your mana is a fight where you could have downranked less heavily. If you’re the top of the overhealing meter, but nobody you were assigned to heal died, and you didn’t go OOM, then there’s no issue.
---
NA(EST) - PVP - Horde - Evening raiding
---
Looking for a guild that raids between the hours of 6-10pm EST. 10:30 being the hard cutoff since I wake up at 5am for work. 
---
I am debating between playing a warrior and priest. I played from Day 1 vanilla through TBC as a warrior. At the time, my main focus was PVP; however, this time around I want to be more focused on PVE. I tried a few expansions post TBC and just could not get into them. I recently tried out a private server and I have fallen in love with the game all over again.
---
With that said, I am now 35 years old and have responsibilities. Original plan was to request a week off work to help me a head start on leveling; however, the release of classic falls during the busiest time of the year for me. So it will likely take me 1-2 months to hit 60. Also, while I did progress into naxx, I never did a full clear. I would still consider myself a competent player who will carry his weight in raids.
---
If warrior: Orc - Mining / BS
---
If Priest: Undead - Tailoring / Enchanting (or maybe herb/alch for transmutes)
---
My ideal guild would be a bunch of ex-vanilla players who have experience with the game and are semi-serious about it. I.E. Want to progress, but not fighting for progression at a grueling pace.
---
Feel free to send me a PM on here or on discord: Siffer#1612.
---
Yeah, I was mostly wondering about the " Hots are trash because if you are leaving someone below max to let your  renew tick then another healer might not notice it and just heal them to  full.  " part, but yeah. Not the whole story that then.
---
So bad scaling, better tools at hand, how the fights are mechanically, mana efficiency and  you have them not being worth it.
---
Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer.
---
I played a gnome warrior for all of vanilla - they look absolutely awesome.  
---
I am going to go horde this time around as my friends would like to - but I stand by gnomes being the coolest race in the game.  Enjoy!
---
brooo sameeeee
---
I have this too. I have a Beta: Classic, and this, just WoW Classic. Not sure what the difference is.
---
Eh, I just like a fight. I'm not interested in ganking people that have zero chance of victory. The fights I go into thinking I might lose are the best ones. Makes victory better, and I learn things if I lose.
---
I literally don’t get it.
---
Fun/to answer a question/I can resell the parts eventually and recoup most expenses.
---
A lot of people’s computers couldn’t handle 40 man raids back in 05.  Mine was one of them.  Resulted in less than 1 FPS.  All other content was fine, just not 40 man raids...
---
I was thinking of going with a Hunter, anyone else thinking the same? It seems like figuring out how to kite and control a pet can be ultimately beneficial down the road
---
oh wow you're gonna have fun once the r14 grind comes around and AQ40 is months away. By the way, us PvPers have had to muck through dragonslaying every single content patch since vanilla other than a few seasons in cata, which still certain classes required trinkets/weapons.
---
woah... tell her to cut down on drinking
---
The class isn't as fun to play without some on demand swing like CS.  Like technically you could say warriors don't need MS with the same reasoning.
---
that's me right now... the more classes I try the less certain I am what I am gonna play... -.-
---
I made friends with the Dwarf Paladin who constantly led raids on Org. It sounds like a PvP server isn't what you should be rolling on. You also sound exactly like the sort of person I'll delight in Aim shot sniping from Shadowmeld. c:
---
If i see a single judgement out of a paladin in my raid he is gonna get a stern, but fair, talking to and I'm taking one of his toys away.
---
Wrong, but go ahead and be a dick about it too.
---
I feel personally attacked by any BC related posts, as BC was when I no lifed the hardest.  Literally the entire expansion I was fresh out of high school, living at home and not working, playing 14+ hours a day, 7 days a week.  I raided, I arena'd, I did BGs.  I literally lived in fucking Outland for almost 2 years.
---
Everyone I heard bitching about PvP gear was almost always a pure PvE player, and it showed.  If PvP gear was universally better, why did every raider go out and get full PvP gear then?  Why didn't every PvPer go out and full clear every raid in their "superior" gear?
---
Yeah idk enough about ideal pop caps for servers to comment much but it's reassuring to see something being done in this space. Either way it'll be interesting to see how healthy pops look after ~6months
---
What about swapping to drop stacks?
---
I'll work on it in the future. I'm super new to editing, this is my first video.
---
Rogue is one of the top DPS throughout the entire expansion.  The world PvP can be fun if you make it so, but they’re boring as hell in any other form of PvP IMO. But yeah, from a PvE standpoint I always enjoyed my rogues.
---
I miss the BG grind for gear, it was very satisfying for some reason.
---
Skullcrusher EU or US, because I was on EU, Knight of The Temple guild :)
---
I expected a picture of Drake on the left, not Generic McWhitebread.
---
This is why they put a rating requirement on the season 3 and 4 weapons if I remember correctly. 
---
Because the arena weapon dps matched the lower end of the current raid tier's weapon drops.
---
Ah, it should work on live because it uses the legion client. Sorry about that.
---
&gt;posting in an epic thread
---
[Stuff like Ignore Armor](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=34197) and some [maces](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=29996)) were argued to be better in some situations.  
---
The only reason people didn't break the glaive set was the haste proc... Did you even play tbc?
---
It was transformable, was changed in 1.8 to just give you both.

Sweeping Strikes, where you hit an additional target with your melee hits, yeah that's really good aoe /s. Meanwhile warlocks and especially mages get actual AoE abilities. You could make a case that Whirlwind is as good as a hunter's Multi-shot, but arms don't get anything that makes it better. Sweeping Strikes will only proc off a single WW hit regardless of how many targets were hit. And even then, you didn't mention Whirlwind. Apparently MS is better for aoe (and apparently Onyxia is an aoe pull). At least try to make your argument convincing, there's so many boss fights in MC where you can and want to cleave, which is what Sweeping Strikes is for. Not AoE situations, but cleaving situations. Doesn't make Arms good for raids though.
---
Arms isn't an "uncommon pve spec". It's intentionally gimping yourself when you could be fury 2h with the same gear.
---
If you really want to improve, write down every step this guy does, then practice following his route
---
WoW classic is the actual game that's going live in 2 months and it's for the stress test starting tomorrow.
---
I already went through it the first time, I wont be progression raiding in classic.  I plan on taking the casual path this time around and enjoying making one of everything.
---
heh people paid much more for bis rouges with glaves back in tbc
---
If you hit "play" you get a list of non descript servers. 16 in total... Interesting.
---
This sounds like my plan, minus 12 characters. One main, one alt. Won’t have time for more.
---
Yes! I used to dread leveling until I started reading quests and knew why I needed to go collect my thousandth boar meats
---
Hmm interesting, I'll definitely try that tomorrow.
---
Do you have to be subbed for this or they letting any of us freaks in
---
Ohman, wait until you get into the joy of going across enemy lines to tame a rare skin. I did that for the white Horde quest lion on a NE, then the item spawned ghost saber on a troll.
---
Sike found it
---
Nah, 311 only.
---
I don’t have it. I still have the beta not the live version.
---
You didn't need 1850 to get weapons until season 3 i believe.
---
I had garbage ratings and managed to get weapons early on.
---
1% ever killing a boss in Naxx is still pretty rough, considering Naxx had few easy bosses. Like you didn't need to be an AQ guild to kill bosses like Razuvious and Anub'Rekhan. Specially Razuvious I remember being a boss many guilds killed rather easily from Naxx even if they didn't end up getting other bosses.

---
One of my fondest memories of vanilla is playing my first WSG at ~lvl 15. I was fury specced and got one kill for every five deaths but was having a blast.  I ended up doing the grind at 60 to rank 12 (as arms obviously) and enjoyed it but nothing ever matched the fun that was had during that first WSG.
---
If I had followed a guide or picked a “top tier” spec I could have been robbed of this experience. Pick any class and spec that just sounds cool to you and ride the wave.
---
Potting in a duel is stupid but nothing wrong with putting in pvp when its life or death
---
Ehhh back THEN it wasn't about raiding. Things have changed though. WoW is all about raiding now and that's what Classic will be about, without question. The reason it wasn't about raiding back then is because no one knew the game and everyone sucked at it.
---
Got a question, it shows the beta for me, i can't open it though, is this because i was in a previous stress test holdover, or is it because i don't have game time? I don't want to buy game time and only find out i don't even really have access
---
This is the setup my friend and I are running.
---
1. Don't spec Prot
---
2. Don't spec heals
---
Prot does too little damage and you won't even need a shield outside of dungeons.  
---
Priest can use a few openers then just Wand (make sure to keep the wand updated) this will do enough damage and allow for enough mana regen after the 5 second rule that you should have very little down time.  
---
Note: Tell her not to Shield you, you won't generate any rage from taking damage if you have a Power Word: Shield up.
---
Its a touch screen, but for games like Diablo 3, you can't use the screen for movement/abilities.
---
I only bought a switch for playing shit when I'm out of town for work and want to game from my hotel.  Though honestly, if I knew I was gonna be gone for more than 2-3 weeks, I'd probably pack my whole fucking rig up and just play Classic that way.
---
For sure, but I'd argue it was implemented poorly. Paladins do a lot less damage, and we joke that it's none, but they can actually do damage. They aren't worth a dps slot for their utility, that is the issue. I would say ret Paladin is like 25% utility, 50% damage and they just left off the fucking last 25% and didn't put it anywhere. The kicker is all that utility minus a couple heals could be gotten from one Holy Paladin, making the ret essentially just 50% dps.
---
Paladin loses too much damage putting on cloth, at which point it might as well just spec holy and be a GOOD healer, and it loses too much healing putting on dps plate to still do comparatively less damage than everyone else. It's objectively poorly balanced for raid content. It's fine most other places, but raid content wasn't something most people really did in Vanilla until private servers and now everyone is wondering why paladin wasnt balanced. It made sense in context at the time why it wasnt ever fixed, Holy was very good and they expected you to go as that spec if you wanted to raid. They didn't care about all specs being good or even viable for every raid tier, and honestly still don't to this day lol....
---
&gt; Let’s stop making redundant posts
---
People want to make redundant posts, let them.
---
If you going to call a dungeon by its final boss then DeadMines would be EC=Edwin Vancleef
---
I'd argue the opposite to be honest. If someone is looking to learn something that is already well documented, why shouldn't they take the advice of an experienced player? If that is what they are seeking then by all means do. It would be anti-progressive to abandon information and relearn what is already available by trial and error.

They are your numbers, rounded up: 28 days x 2 hours per day = 56 hours.  That’s the post I was responding to. And 12 hours of labour wouldn’t be worth it either, unless you just enjoyed farming and do it as leisure, anyways.
---
Ya 1 hour instead of 3 would be nice, but I'd rather spend the extra 2 hours raiding then how ever many hours farming to get the consumables

Private servers have a lot of hidden tweaks to their gameplay.

I got killed by a Tauren hunter while I tried to tame The Rake near Crossroads. Then he tamed it before I could get back and stop him so I had to wait for forever for him to come back.

No worries, thanks for replying

Spell canceling is definitely a big thing to keep in mind that was a common vanilla tactic which fell out of use later.

---
we had ML but you rolled for BiS. my problem with loot council is it could be months before a "trial" who has helped push sees a reward for their efforts, every guild i've been in with loot council &gt; rolls hasn't been a fun guild to be in the "higher ups" care too much about loot for themselves whether or not they're the better healer/dps or tank and it's actually made guilds fall apart several times, especially when a core raider who's been getting gear and performing better than the loot council gets slighted by the loot council so leaves for another guild.   
---
for the 112 guilds in the world who have a hard core base willing to get shit on for months on end to get gear i'm sure its a great system but for the majority of the player base i think its shit and a good reason for players to quit their guilds if not the game.
---
Had the same issue. Deinstall wow classic and see if it remains. For me i was in stress test had some classic beta stuff in the developement tab.. after uninstalling its gone. So i dont have beta or stress test tomorrow.. i was in the last stress test though and still hald the client. Thats why i saw it. 
---
Is you beta in the dev or in the live category? Live should meanu got stress tomorrow. I mean everyone from america and oceanic gets it.
---
Ah, oops.
---
I can relate to that. Fuck "going out". After my daughter goes to sleep, it's WoW time.
---
Are there any oceanic realms?
---
I’m really bummed out that Warcraftlogs is going to exist for classic, that is going to guide people even more into being annoyingly min-max. Vanilla raiding is honestly like normal/early heroic bosses now, have people that can stay online and 80% of the raid live, you’re good.
---
This is awesome.
---
what do you love about it?
---
Hmm, my server wasnt even a big server but we were tied for 11th in progression on our server and we only got half way through aq40
---
Exactly, I feel like every priest needs to learn the cancel dance to make sure they learn the five second rule. If you always try to keep everyone topped off, you'll never learn how to conserve your mana properly - downranking might help some, but it's not always the most efficient method.
---
How's that melee leeway treating you?
---
This is for a install so you can play the stress test to level 15th tomorrow till Friday

I'm not saying they are the best in terms of all the classes my dude I'm comparing them to other warriors.  Turn your debate trigger down a bit.

I kind of agree. But using consumes if you want does put you ontop of everyone else dmg wise.

What I dont like is the clear in DM tribute for guardbuffs. Prob 1 hour or more. Then going to felwood to get sunflower. Then log out at gromgol to keep buffa from falling off till raid. Making you toon 100% useless because you cant use.

But then going zg buff portal to org for rend and ony buff before hearth to kargath. Feels like hours each week obtaining buffs l.

But you can clear bwl and MC in 1 hour doing this in 1 night. Free up your week to pvp and not interrupt your spec

Because you always have a 1% to miss.

If your healer is good, then tanking as fury is fine. Just be careful about pulls.

I think it'd be more like 20 of those make it past 20, and 8 or so make it to 60, 1 or 2 of which will tank

...Again, two entirely different games. You seriously think someone is just going to ask a question like that and NOT ask which version of the game? C'mon now.

its a bunch of gold for a very slight upgrade. not worth it. why do you hope im trolling?

Honestly, I'd probably pay 1-2k for an account with any season BC glad drakes that I could link to my account.
---
I also might be a moron though.
---
So what was 'the pve-pvp trinket' in TBC then if it was 'such a problem'?
---
Except that most guild won't use dkp, they'll prefer loot council because it's easier and less retarded. So if you want to outshine everybody and get best loot first you'll need consumables/world buffs, people realizing that will just do the same and content will be trivialised.
---
Vanilla Wow IS about raiding. To some people. And that's fine.

Nightmare fuel.

It’s also a super minor upgrade, so there’s no pressure to work towards it.

Oh, gee, you got me, I mistook that the haste proc and the AP vs demons were not one combined effect! That means you win the argument right? Oh, no, that's not how it works. 
---
Glaives were the undisputed best Rogue weapons.
---
&gt;but I seriously suggest to the newer folks that you don't try to 'keep up' with these people.
---
I agree to a point. If you don't have 20+ hours a week to play, you aren't gonna end up getting BiS and it's not worth worrying over. And you should always play whatever way is more fun to you. But... that doesn't mean you shouldn't strive for BiS. If you plan to group up with other people at all, which, well, you kind of have to, you should still try to get the best gear available for your class and spec within reason. Don't just be happy with shitty greens at 60 when there are very easy to obtain, much better blues you can get if you spend an hour or two per piece going after in quest chains.

Most of your ability to tank is tied to being in defensive stance and pressing sunder armor which you can do as Arms, fury or Prot with any weapon (shield isn’t required).
---
There are benefits to taking protection talents (better mitigation, more threat, a stun) but these aren’t super important in leveling dungeons.
---
Indeed, some tanks on p. servers are fury/prot dual wield tanking in Naxx but the caveat is that they are very well geared (lots of crit to benefit from flurry) and they do take a lot of damage which is the compromise for doing more threat and allowing geared DPS to shorten the fight meaning healers can be reckless with mana.
---
Dominos and ClassicCastBars :)
---
I wish I remembered my old account name.
---
Does the stress test start today or tomorrow? And for how long are they letting us play?
---
Unstoppable Force for me.
---
Haha, what? Why? It was a giant razor blade and the name perfectly captured that. What gives?
---
TAKE ME THERE
---
I hate how accurate this is.
---
correct
---
Most of the levelling guides out there became outdated with the economic rebalance a few patches back. They increased the attunement requirements for most of the bank related content as well so most people can't solo that anymore
---
Well the license plate is from 06. Met many WoW players over the years when they asked if it was a Deadmines WoW reference. Not much of a yikes if you ask me!
---
Pro tip: don’t call them dwarves to their face.
---
I only ever heard people calling it VC.

I like your message, so many people are going to force themselves to play a Warrior up to 60 thinking BIS will rain from the heavens and shower them with insane DPS, most dont know about the gold sink repair bills are for plate or how 90% of groups frown upon non-tank warriors. Getting those BIS is a real pain in the ass!              
---
            
---
I will level a Warrior with my wife but because I love tanking and I can vividly recall trying to raid tank on my druid but I dont have any delusions of topping damage meters or one shotting people in PvP or being Rank 14.             
---
It's going to be interesting to see how many Warriors there are at the start of Classic and how many are still playing near the end.
---
The Greater Good.
---
I agree with Summ1t partially. Yes, everyone should play what they want but they should also have all the information when making that decision. Not everyone scours classic forums or this subreddit all day and knows every little thing there is to know about this game and that's where it's important that we talk about meme specs. Someone might think that retri is the most badass thing ever because they played one in Wrath and it was the bomb, spend months leveling one, then realize that "Oh, so I just auto attack, seal and judge. No crusader strike or anything?", and get discriminated against at 60 when finding dungeon groups because he didn't know any better. Or their aspirations about raiding might change later, which is fine too but then you'd definitely want to have had all the info possible.

&lt;From The Beginning&gt; - Horde | US-East | RP-PvP
---
About Us: Our guild started in 2013 as a reddit post during Mists of Pandariat. Many of us were tired of modern WoW, so we formed a guild with a singular goal: to do old content at the proper character and item level on live servers. Basically, we tried to play Classic on live servers (a pale imitation of the real thing) the best we could do without resorting to private servers. We ended up leveling together and clearing all raid content from lvl 60 Molten Core all the way up to 85 cataclysm with Deathwing. We had tons of fun, and we made some incredible connections along the way. Here's a few of our raids to give you an idea of the atmosphere and environment:
---
BWL run - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauUwwBeHs8

Black Temple Mother Shahraz with no shadow resist gear - https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qTgZToJoS38

Ulduar - https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=C4HyC2BWfv4
---
The gang is getting back together for Classic. The newest iteration of &lt;From The Beginning&gt; will be a combination of three guilds; two of them from modern WoW that have cleared all content In Legion and part of BFA at Heroic and bits of Mythic. We'll be using a DKP loot system. Our raid schedule is up for discussion, historically we raided weekdays around 8 PM Eastern. Casuals are more than welcome, a lot of our roster is getting older and can't devote the time requirement Classic will demand for 40 man raids. As long as you don't stand in fire and can put out minimum numbers to down content, you can play any spec. That being said, we still intend to fully clear all of Classic up to Kel'Thuzad. Our senior leadership and officers have actually played Classic back in the day and cleared several bosses in Naxx when it was current content.

You couldn't get Onyxia buff in retail vanilla whenever you wanted. You would need to coordonate with every single guild able to clear onyxia to not pop their head the day you raid. On my server none bother and we still went to 13/15 Naxx whitout world buffs.

Practicing the optimal route will still keep you ahead of the pack assuming you put in above average hours. (Probably 12+ daily) Getting even a single quest node ahead is enough to pull away and have low mob tag competition. Everyone is held back equally by the population, so knowing the perfect route to keep yourself ahead will be the difference in separating yourself from them.
---
My plan assuming servers are fully functional on launch(2 week vacation): Play for 16-20 hours, sleep 6 hours, then start a play 16, sleep 6, Real Life 2 rotation until vacation is over. If I can get ahead of the pack by my first 30 hours played, I think i'll have a shot of getting 60 in around 5 days played. Would be around day 8 of launch since i'm sleeping so much. Then I can chill farming Devilsaur Leather and Herbs for the next 6 days and be rich for the rest of Classic. There will be plenty that do it faster either by account sharing or sleeping less or just having a better than 120 hour played to 60. But that's the best I think I can do.
---
It’s up to the DM to present short scenarios where a stealth class can feel useful while not bogging down the pace for the party.
---
I knew plenty of names on my old Vanilla server that were known very well to be campers or gankers. Just like how I remember certain players were called our for Ninja looting.

That sounds all well and good but nothing beats spamming frostbolt and watching tv series
---
Actually only 10. The numbering is off and the highest server is 16 but there are only 10 of them in actuality
---
For the test do you have to level? Or is it precreated lv 15s
---
Razuvious is actually the hardest starter boss, due to the RNG of mind control breaking early. Noth and Anub'Rekhan on the other hand, were basically free loot if your guild was skilled enough to get to Naxx in the first place.
---
VC = VanCleef, the end boss of deadmines
---
O my bad, its been awhile sense i have seen the older episodes.
---
So many people, so few classes. I’m not too worried about how many people play the same class. Can always fit in a bunch of mages.
---
Uninstall and it should go away.
---
A tank healer should be pre (cancel) casting and keeping them topped off with low rank heals.  It's not an either/or.
---
You quickly get a feel of how much damage the tank is taking and pre cast an appropriate rank.  You cancel it if the tank doesn't take damage.
---
For dps healing, you're only pre-casting when you can see who is about to take damage.  A lot of the time you wont notice who is going to get hit until they actually do.
---
It's not that we didn't know the five second rule, it's that we didn't want the tank to die to a parry hasted crushing blow.  By keeping the tank full, other healers also have time to react.  It could be something as simple as the tank healer disconnecting, but if your letting your tank sit at two-thirds of their hp so that you can max rank heal then you are playing with fire.
---
Still not showing for me. I have an active subscription, but I don't have Battle for Azeroth.
---
Imagine imagining
---
I hope they name the servers after streamers just to give this sub an aneurysm, tbh.
---
Yeah, I can't really fault them for that considering its a shattered world.
---
Aww, that sucks a ton. I always try to help other hunters with their tame regardless of faction. I got that guy on my Orc Hunter and plan to get him again in Classic.
---
This wouldnt work.  All of the hunters would start on the Ashkandi server.
---
Gogogogogo
---
I'll be jamming to darude as I carry the flag with my drood

Because min/maxers in their quest to devalue and put down "casuals" flat out spread misinformation about optimal builds being required.

You played AV for the fun of it. Long after I had my rep epics I kept playing just for the fun.

CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWLING INNNNN MY SKINNNNNNNNNNNNN

People were way the fuck over hit cap for most things in tbc.  Its part of the reason why you see less hit on high tier gear...
---
I’ve never had the glory of a bidet, but I must ask, how does it get all of the shit off? 
---
You still have to wipe right? If not the PSI on that bidet must be high, which means it’s probably just spraying shit water all over the dark side of your balls.
---
The cinematic was perfect.
---
Everyone calm down.

I have a tiny toilet. It’s a delicate balance of gettin gym hole super clean, yet not having dead thighs because I can’t fit my hand around my thick Latino booty. I’m not even fat, this toilet is just fucking tiny. It’s like I’m shitting into a Folgers can.
---
new Path of Exile league atm
---
True but an enhance can spec into improved strength of earth/grace of air and improved windfury totem. Having a dedicated pro totem twister has to be worth something.
---
Ah I had a similar idea but I changed my mind. I realized that I enjoy completionism &amp; RPG elements more than reaching level 60 fast, so I'll be speed leveling to like 30 the first days - then just do all my professions &amp; level them together with my character ;)
---
I want to get through the inital horde as fast as possible &amp; to be fair low level vanilla gameplay is pretty weak.
---
&gt;The only downside is soul shard farming
---
 * They have no mobility. No run speed, no blink, nothing. If you need to run away then you are doing it at regular speed.
---
 * They are extremely poor at doing upfront damage. If you are doing a 5-man dungeon and the mobs are yellow or green then the mobs will die well before you have a chance to apply all your dots and then you'll be OOM while the rest of your group continues to chain pull. Sure you could PO your healer by constantly life tapping, but then your healer will just wonder why they bothered to bring along a Warlock since you require more heals AND do less dps than the &lt;Rogue|Hunter|Shaman|Mage|Warrior&gt;. You really only have the option to apply corruption and then wand, or throw 2 shadow bolts instead. It is still way worse than bringing along any other DPS class. This is the primary reason that Warlocks get passed over for other classes in 5-mans.
---
Yeah. Raiding at all was seen as a prestigious thing that only the "top" guilds did. I remember being excited to actually get accepted into my first shitty MC guild, like I was a real player now.
---
MC was puggable by the end, but BWL and beyond weren't part of the scene for a lot of players.
---
“Greatest game of all-time.”
---
Less is more :)
---
How did you enjoy Troll?
---
Nice enterprise reference
---
That last para is why there's so much more drama in "casual" guilds.
---
Druid or Lock.. Or maybe Hunter.. But do I really want to be a pure dps class again? No. So Druid.. But I like murdering people.. UGH
---
IIRC it's roughly 500g worth of Runecloth if you did all the quests while leveling. That means it'll depend on how much slower it'll take to level vs. how fast you could farm gold at 60.
---
Haha yeah I just got a budget gaming laptop for real cheap. Can def run WoW. Im just worried about cooling as placing it on your thighs/bed can cause laptops to heat up. 
---
Ebay has laptop stands for real cheap that you can use on your bed while laying down. I ordered one a few hours ago.
---
Are you asking me "what trinkets were good in TBC for PvP"? You were either using the badge gear trinket, or whatever you could get your hands on from a raid that was good. It literally depends on wherever you were in your guild's progression and your spec. There could be a dozen different trinkets. As a resto shaman I was using fel reaver's piston for most of my time spent in Arena but it literally just depends on what you could get your hands on.
---
Same im gonna be able to watch so much netflix during raids
---
that right there is proof that they will fail classic. that's not the low poly 180p 5fps vanilla opening cinematic 12yo me remembers like it was today, it's clearly been remastered!  classic is doomed
---
Fury warriors have a place in any raid and telling your guild that you don't want tank gear is going to help.
---
If you were asking the opposite, I'd say dont roll tank war for a newbie to classic
---
Drood flag storm.

Is blizzard based in Europe?

Opened the Blizzard client to see that I have a wow account for World of Warcraft Classic.
---
No.
---
HOLY DIVEeeeerrRRRRRR!  
---
YOUVE BEEN DOWN TO LONG IN THE MIDNIGHT SEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Old News.....
---
I'll play when I want to. Not play when I don't. Keep my regularly scheduled life things in order and on time. Aim to have a main to 60 and alt to 35 in about 8 weeks. Won't be upset if I fail. That's about it. No rush.
---
Good post. It bugs me especially when people talk about post Naxx content and all they think about are new raids. New content doesn´t have to be raids. I for one would like the 1-59 world to be enriched for even better replayability.
---
I was actually listening to this album at work today... da trolls be runnin tings now brudduh.
---
Uh you gotta do one for ICB too, the diet UF
---
C'mon man. Haven't you heard. Classic is coming out!
---
The distance gap is too wide for them to 'sprint and reapply'. Trust me, i have put it in practice several times. I hunters mark while the trap is still up, and while i am in aspect of the cheetah, the slow of crippling poisoned is basically walk speed at that point. I just serpent sting so they cant stealth, and another second later, they wont catch me. Plus i can intimidate with pet for the extra stun seconds if needed.
---
Pallys dont run out of mana with good gear. Their cleanse is less mana than your viper, so you could instead spam low ranking viper stings forcing them to cleanse which is significantly more mana than your low level viper sting. 
---
I can beat every class in 1v1 as a hunter, but i also lose to very geared players or people on epic mounts. If you dont have an epic mount, i am very good at kiting pretty much every class except another hunter, in otherwords i can beat every class since im untouchable. And another hunter i would just send my pet to attack to prevent them from aspect of the cheetah while laying freezing traps down so their pets cant touch me.
---
Lol it cracks me up how many up votes this has had as I have been doing this for too long now. My poor wife has to see me check the classic wow reddit every night....
---
&gt; Excuse my English, it is not my first language.
---
The only thing you got wrong was writing "nostalgic" instead of "nostalgia", otherwise this reads like a betterthan-average native English speaker.
---
Make sure you get a 2h staff ASAP and use that. Upgrade to a new staff at the second town. I got to 1-10 with Tauren shaman not even rushing at around 2 hours.
---
lol thanks, they going to update this for Classic I assume?
---
You guys are super cool, glad you're so helpful in this community, making others feel very comfortable asking honest questions
---
Actually no, if it were in scope of an NDA he would have not posted anything.
---
They said they are going to in another post I saw on here. I book marked it and will definitely be checking it on launch haha
---
There could be any number of differences between private servers and the real thing. 
---
We already know about the massive difference in parry. Rage generation could be lower, threat modifiers could be off, bosses could do way more damage so tanks will have to focus more on defensive stats than offensive ones.
---
And then of course every single guild will be different with how many consumables and world buffs they choose to run with.
---
I'm of the opinion that until we've been proven otherwise when the game has been released we should go with the assumption that the same meta will be optimal in 2019 as in 2005. This means that mages and rogues are the safe classes to stack when it comes to pure DPS roles. Warriors and Warlocks may be too volatile, especially on the horde side. Hunters have stayed the same for 14 years so they'll probably remain where they've always been.
---
You forgot Rammstein, used to be in a lot of PvP videos back in the day.
---
Pvp : "warriors of the world" - Manowar
---
Good post. It bugs me especially when people talk about post Naxx content and all they think about is new raids. New content doesn´t have to be raids. I for one would like the 1-59 world to be enriched for even better replayability. Or new raids in between T1/T3. Let Naxx remain the end.
---
Enjoying?? I never got into PoE, Im not sure why . Everything around it looked neat.
---
Oh ok, that could be kind of annoying but I suppose it's a matter of learning to play around it, right?
---
Liik up the news for the stress test starting tmw.
---
Bhelliom from Elenium series? Great read. Might have to reread it to get some ideas for names.
---
I guess we’ll find out tomorrow.
---
Most of it was recycled cinematics, just in reverse. If we are being honest. I loved it, don't get me wrong but haters gonna hate
---
Yep, I've played each league for the last few and enjoy it. It can be a bit overwhelming as the game has a lot of depth, but it's still worth checking out if you enjoy diablo style ARPGs.
---
Why do all posts release dates have an asterisk ‘the day prior on the US’
---
Yea stress test starts tomorrow for everyone
---
Yep, the author is currently updating it and has released a preliminary version on the ConsolePort discord that I've been using in the beta that works with basically everything except the custom bars at the moment, you just get regular action bars marked with what button combinations they're bound to.
---
Appreciate the advice, just don't know what I'll be farming at 60 on mage as opposed to running dungeons right away on warrior =P especially with waiting until phase 3 for dm.
---
lol
---
In our wrath pugs it was the opposite.  The pvper was probably comming for a weapon or trinket, and would be good.  They don't need to do 99th percentile dps compared to 95th percentile in pvp gear, they needed to not fucking stand in the shit on the ground.  
---
ToC proved this to such extent it was hilarious.
---
My buddy had the beta one reupped his sub and still can't play, so dont get baited by it
---
Stress test starts tomorrow
---
But then u can’t invite rogues or hunters either or shaman if you play on terrible horde :p
---
I am of that opinion too. Not that I don’t appreciate and enjoy pservers. You just can’t take anything to be 100% accurate, or even really 90%. Maybe they are really accurate but we won’t know until we’re there.
---
Also on the point of consumables, spawn points and timers on classic will be vastly different that pservers that we know for sure. Won’t be nearly as much Black lotus on the market so won’t be nearly as many flasks to be had.
---
This was clearly an exaggerated example but i think he might be right. Where i live multiple citys have the same street names and that have confused me a few times in my life. If that could be prevented by making new names for new servers, shouldnt it?
---
I have a switch and would by this to do mindless gathering and grinding while at work or in bed. Then I could actually play at home on the pc. I play pve anyways so wouldn't matter about PvP.
---
I definitely do. I'll take a look, thanks man!
---
Well on private servers half the warriors didnt get to 60.  Then another half of the remaining quit when they have to tank for loot.  Half of the then remaining get pre raid and 80% of that half are arms/ fury.  Then we have tank shortage again.
---
No worries!  It wasn’t the best reference to some of his great lines.
---
START THE BETA BEFORE I PISS MYSELF
---
They could absolutely do an episode where the group is divided between streamers and non streamers/haters.  It would turn out hilarious of course.
---
Umm where is mindless self indulgent and Daft Punk
---
If theres another stress test you should have the char still, but they are all wiped on release.
---
Have you rebooted your battle.net app? Like closed out completely and booted it up?
---
Are you on Na? If so update your battle net client.
---
If your computer and pump out the frames, the engine wont artificially stop you. If thats what you are asking
---
Most of the best gear in the game is through raiding though. Remember, Classic has no "catch up" mechanics. 
---
You can pvp, if you want to go that route, but pvp gear is gated behind your ranking. It means you have to spend as much time pvping as you would raiding in order to get good gear. 
---
The goal should be to provide players with as much information as possible so they know what they are getting in to. 
---
Classic is a game that will suck up a lot of your time. If you want good gear, and therefore your character to actually ***be*** good, you'll have to raid or pvp a lot. 
---
Otherwise you'll find yourself outmatch by someone who has done those things. 
---
If that doesn't seem appealing to you or you cannot commit to that kind of time investment, Classic may not be your game.
---
My highest was a 52 or 53 hunter.  My best friend had a toon around 40 on my account, and got his own account in TBC.
---
Is rp officially going to happen in Classic now?
---
Lockboxes are fun, but other than that usually just gold or grey items. Sometimes the grey items vendor for a lot iirc
---
the frames isnt what im asking about, im asking about the screens refresh rate, i have a powerful 240hz screen, and older games dont support it, unless they are adding a new option that accomadates this refresh rate under the resolution tab
---
Yep you wouldn’t have made it into my guild with that history. #shame
---
What a useless comment, talking about these things sooner is best so the wow team can either get idea's or we can refine the idea before we pass it along to blizzard so they have time to refine it inhouse also.  
---
If we wait until Naxx clears it'll be years until this kind of stuff is ready you have to understand how long it takes to make content.  
---
and when you say "you wont do this" its normally projection knowing you wont be able to manage it yourself, i don't know if i'll go hard into classic hard enough to clear naxx right away or it might take me longer to get to it, but what does that matter? when i do or if i do i and others would like something else.  
---
but i wont just talk from my butt i guess i'll let you judge for yourself Rahsia on aman'thul has my achievements and doesn't have alt code in the name.
---
Another brainlet who doesn't realize that in order to win games you also have to beat the twinks that were on the enemy team.
---
also,  I do compete in boxing and have had 3 fights so far
---
Greater Blessings + Pally Power addon makes it super simple to buff an entire raid.
---
My friend and I played there Alliance side and call it VC. He was there at launch.
---
I suppose it's easier to say "August 13th (except for the US)" than it is to say "August 12th (except for Europe, Asia, and Australia).
---
Technically part of Europe (UK, Spain, half of France) gets it on August 12th and August 26th too, for an hour.
---
Most new players quit after reaching level 10.
---
I did try to flesh out a nice map but honestly i suck at photoshop lol i might give it another try later, i mean this all would require the servers to be massively upgraded, its possible that a fog effect would be required just to make the place less laggy, and that could introduce some really cool pvp.
---
I always thought tanking was boring.
---
Do you think because a game doesnt have an in-game setting for Hz means it doesn't support your monitor? Hz is how many times per second the monitor updates. If you run the game at the same FPS then they are perfectly in sync. Most likely the Hz settings in games only caps the FPS
---
When I played WOW on my 17" laptop, I used a laptop cooling mat/fan from radio shack. 
---
Worked well, but still had normal heat. 
---
Fellow guildmates would always complain about sitting in their chairs during raids. 
---
Laptop Gaming is so relaxing and the only way to go.
---
Enjoy

Its reddit bro

Oranges and apples mate, your opinion and mine.. I'm not surprised at all, what I was surprised with was when I joined this sub how against bfa everyone is, I really cannot see an issue with the game, but I guess we all get our enjoyment in different ways.
---
Old trees strength was leveling, some fine tuning control, such as warriors / rogues with weapon specs and maybe some utility choices, and the fact you felt like a class rather than a spec because at any point you could put a point in a different spec, if it had a nice bonus.
---
The new talent trees could be very good and promote far more choices if they weren’t half made up of lost abilities and often have clear cut choices. Havoc Demon hunter felt really good with it, as you effectively had three main builds with a few utility pick ups, and you could change parts of the build of an encounter didn’t lean toward that talent. It’s a shame that in the end it came down to what tier bonuses you had determined what “spec” of havoc you played (and the absolute slaying of old demonic in Beta).
---
That build absolutely worked in PvE though; that’s why I mentioned it. IIRC, it was raid worthy and everything, but you could most certainly run everything below raid level in it. You were basically an unkillable tank that could provide major instant cast heals for you or your group.
---
Umm ok? Not sure how the announcement cinematic proves anything.
---
High psi but usually very well aimed. Don’t think of it like a big faucet stream, think of it like a smaller water fountain stream. It only gets your balls if the stream is spraying weird (which can happen). I’d say 4/5 times my balls are fine.
---
And no, no wiping needed. Just dry off!
---
well ur right about that, but i did play on private servers, at 300fps and it wasnt showing 240hz, i can tell the difference between 60 and 240, u get the screen tearing affect when u move rapidly.
---
yes there is, it's sub optimal. wtf are u even arguing? moving ur mouse to the action bar removes your ability to manipulate the camera, makes you more likely to misclick in a frantic fight and hinders your ability to target switch if tab isnt going to target what you want to target. 
---
can't believe you're defending clicking in 2019 and calling people elitist shitheads who suggest you shouldn't click
---
So by that logic Molten Core is R rather than MC?
---
Different streets in the same city is not only rare, but an entirely different situation.
---
WoW Classic and WoW BFA are ***two entirely different games***. Having similar server names between them would not cause any more confusion than having "Stormwind" be named "Stormwind" in both games.
---
Some encounters your guild might ask you to be an offtank, 4 horsemen requires 8 tanks so unless youve got a lot of available offtanks in the guild and you happen to be the one not assigned to tank then it would be 100% dps throughout all of the content. But in general, yes, if you let the guild youre joining know that you want to be on the lowest priority for offtanking then thats an option. Most fights usually just need 1-3 tanks which would be your normally assigned tanks in the raid group. Then a few fights you need around 5 tanks depending on which strategy you use such as sulfuron or majordomo etc
---
MC breaking early was annoying for sure but not that bad. We did it with 2 priests and I was one of them. Just used some spellhit and tanking him close made the breaks handlable. At least I remember many guilds killing him as the first boss. Anub wasn't that bad either but the trash to him was brutal. Have this nice picture reminding me of when we started learning the trash https://i.imgur.com/EcWouLV.jpg
---
There are some crafting items that are mainly (iirc only) gathered through pickpocketing. Granted they aren’t used in many recipes (only 1 or 2). Also a good way to get poison/ability mats without a vendor/ah.
---
This game client was found in the "Live" section of my accounts. Usually, the beta and stress test servers have been in the "Development" section. I'm curious if these are the start to the official servers. Guess I'll see tomorrow
---
So if I see you get a chest and you are on my faction, I should try to train as many NPCs on you as I can so they kill you and I can pick it up.
---
Shadow is crazy!
---
Well my strat for the first two years ia to clear all content 🧐
---
This would be hilarious if these were the names at launch. Just Classic Server 1...2...3...
---
"CONTENT"
---
He will it will just take him 6 months. Because casual gaymore
---
Pickpocketing is your main source of Blinding Powder unless you want to buy/farm Fadeleaf. You can macro it to your stealth openers and since Classic has auto-loot, you won't even really notice.
---
Best thing about classic. You dont have to be forced out into the world as this suggests. You just go.
---
they added this to launchers so that players can download it ahead of time.
---

---
Thank you. As someone that plans to roll Hunter, I wish more people would understand this. Hunters are very competitive in early raids. Not many guild will make you sit MC because of the eventual drop off during AQ. If they do, it's time to find a new guild.
---
You would only drop them from dying in PvP.
---
Were some of these servers oceanic?
---
I know but this would be another incentive to get players exploring the zones even at level 60.
---
Just google it
---
The reason people don't like HoTs is because you cannot stack them on a single person, which sucks when you have 5-6 healers.
---
I was a shockadin for a huge chunk of Vanilla and that build was something blizzard hated so much they moved it out of the reach of the points, minmax didn't exist except for the 1% and trust me they aren't on this sub.
---
Very true, good pickup.
---
yes, I booked marked it too.
---
I mean, there are always going to be some streamers, key is avoiding the ones like ASMON.   If I had a guy like that on my server I'd probably quit, could only imagine the stupid shit that would go on.
---
wtf??? My game just crashed
---
Not MC getting resisted, but MC randomly breaking early as it tends to do, I don't think spell hit can reduce chance of breaking early.
---
So many times, my guild wiped on Razuvious because the MC broke unexpectedly, and Razuvious immediately ran over and smacked the Priest dead then started running around and killing the raid. Even when we had Military Wing on farm, we'd still sometimes wipe to MC breaking early.
---
I played from pretty much launch and I saw no one call it VC. First time I saw it was far later in vanilla. Far after 1.3 and dire maul release.
---
The only hybrid ive seen on are druid tank/healer spec for classic. Not great healing but the talent build is solid enough so you can heal or tank just by switching gear
---
I’m just purely playing with guildies and mates. So won’t have to worry about pugging stuff. Maby one or two here and there but most gear will be reserved
---
So rip multiboxers in BG's?

You just convinced me of making a NE hunter !

When youre at home you could always stretch every hour or so, getting up off the chair to move around the house even for just a couple minutes really makes a difference believe it or not. Also you could get an adjustable standing desk which would help out. Or do some quick exercise every 30mins or every hour to get your energy levels elevated which helps maintain your body posture. Sitting in a chair isnt bad if youve got good posture while doing so. Its just a discipline to get to that point if youre really put off about the idea. Theres also simple exercises that can be done while sitting in a chair just google around for them theres plenty.

You don't need it, but it certainly makes things easier and more enjoyable.

Shaman or Paladin depending on faction.

Children of Bodom - Downfall for my warrior's rage-filled mind

Farming shards does mean you'll generally be killing more mobs than others, which yields more stuff like cloth and drops.

---
I'm rolling my classic Rogue again cause I loved that Scrappy fucker
---
Some Resto shamans spec far enough into enhance to get those talents. It's more of a utility healer build. Those are more useful to a raid than a dps enhance shamans.
---
But play what you want.
---
Someone needs to make a playlist for this. 
---
I would totally listen to it.
---
Aphex Twin for me :)
---
Shamans and druids look pretty good but mana will be an issue.
---
Some people just enjoy knowing they have their bis, even if it’s minor (plus many will like having an epic when they aren’t a dime a dozen). So it’s a nice thing to passively work toward.
---
That makes sense.
---
I want to play a tank. Warrior it is. Ill be needed all the time. Shiny plate wearing bigboy.
---
Oh i have a kid and cant commit to every raid. Damn i cant be around all the time.
---
I want to play a rogue. Its been my main form vanilla i cant live without stealth. 
---
I lack the patients to pvp. I cant just sit and wait for a cds
---
I want to play a druid, i love the hybrid do anything nature of a druid. 
---
Night elfs and taurens just make me not want to play. 
---
I want to play a Paladins looks so cool in their teir gear. 
---
Ill be a bitch boy wearing a dress most of the time. 
---
I want to play a priest. Dwarves are cool and bis, undead is just cool. Pvp is awesome. I can be purple.
---
I find healers boring in pve content. 
---
I want to play shaman. Big swinging hero of the horde. Windfury procs and ill be wanted. 
---
Windfury is just a gimmick and ill be ele or healing.
---
At the moment im feeling mage. But i jump between that and warrior and priest a bit at the moment.
---
Its not exactly the same, it is more refined and disnified, classic wow  had a mix of cartoon and realism, which i really liked, think of the difference between maybe... Prince of egypt art(serious) and Disney(frozen)
---
you could 5 holy pal and 1 flurry warrior with it and it would probably be a net boost just from the debuff uptime i think. Probably more from a hunter with mp5 consumables and hilariously even mp5 gear.

I feel ya brother. The message didn't just show a reversal of old cinematics. it's an admission that they were wrong to tell you what you wanted and that they are now making an attempt to do so. I especially liked their presentation on how they dug up the old code, textures and models which explained why its so hard to recreate classic.
---
So if someone is trying to kill me and I have one, I should run into a pack of mobs so one of them last-hits me.
---
At least you're not an alliance rogue having to go up against orc racial.
---
Yeah, fuck them night elves just chillin in their own trees and shit
---
Did you figure it out? It's not on the main bar on the left, you have to click on a box near the bottom left and toggle it to classic
---
The last text I sent him was “it’s the greatest mmorpg of all time, you’re doing yourself a service” lol
---
Yep, I want to see how much the pet interface sucks in classic.
---
I found it, hasn’t updated my launcher recently so no drop down, thanks!
---
Any chance this will be put on any other podcast platforms?
---
Yours looks pretty good. Seems to be keeping with the original and 1.12 being a bit darker. I like it!
---
Eh, details.
---
LFG is widely considered what killed the social element of WoW classic.
---
No-I am not familiar with the downranking penalty. I'll look into it.
---
Great comments thanks!
---
Nah, originally it was a bow that could turn into a staff.
---
It didn't lose it's transformation ability until 1.8.
---
&gt;The whole reason it became easy and boring though is because people wanted it to be easier and faster because they decided they didn’t care about the journey anymore.
---
Do you really think the journey is still fun after 10 times?
---
Tomorrow starting at 5PM PST, lasting 48 hours.
---
None
---
It's not that different. Go to world zones relative to Twink level. The only thing absent in beta PvP is a capped player ganked, corpse camping, and killing flight masters. Thus it yields a healthy world PvP experience. 
---
The biggest draw is that someone wants to play and they can't.
---
It started off with them talking about the Classic launch and then it's literally the same episode after that and then Kyle says something about deja Vu at the end and Cartman calls him a stupid jew.
---
Indestructible came out in 2008...
---
Great point!
---
Auto loot is the big one. You couldn't shift click loot with pickpocket because shift is a modifier for whatever keybind you used. This will make it much less annoying and you can work it into everything.
---
That's why I said there's no pressure; nobody should be **required** to go for Truefaith if they already have Exalted.
---
Legit how big is this rock so many people seem to be under? How do people who frequent this sub not know about the stress test tomorrow?

Viper sting, concuss, run away, repeat
---
Traurens are the only good revamp imo, except its ruined by the cartoony animations where they open their mouth and smile when they talk, definatly the "flower race" and not the, holding a massive totem and smashing skulls. they lost their seriousness, the battlescars and hardened by battle.
---
This is great! I really hope you finish it and would be happy to help if you want. It might be worth listing any good quest daggers for the off-hand.
---
Why is Rupture on your list for "Helps with poisons Quest?" I would just wait until level 22 and do the Ambush-&gt;Vanish-&gt;Ambush to instantly kill him. Even without it, you don't really need Rupture, he becomes a regular mob after your Ambush.
---
Any reason why Detect Traps and Disarm Trap are on your list?
---
It used to be a troll /funny as well but I think it was removed at some point.
---
still gives me chills
---
Until BoP is gone anyway
---
I brought this up on one of Asmons streams, but nobody saw it.

I have completely opposite feelings about "environment, lore, art direction, item rewards"...  
---
Dungeons and raids in tbc were actually a little bit challenging and not a total aoe faceroll like in wotlk...  
---
I loved more melancholic and darker atmosphere of tbc... It still had that element of austerity that was later lost to powercreeping high fantasy / too much magic in the shifting art/lore direction...  
---
Things I didn't like about tbc was the huge pre-raid bis grind / rep grind and pvp balance... Idk, in classic it feels like part of the game but in tbc it felt like a chore... :D

Enchanters and Bards from classic EQ come to mind. Crazy good support classes. Enchanters have great charms, CC, mana regen/haste. Bards have a bit of everything but excel at twisting multiple songs to avoid losing the buffs (iirc they drop 3 ticks (18sec) after the song stops), and can deal damage albeit not great. Never got too into Enchanters, but Bard is one of my favorite classes from any MMO ever
---
Yeah I'm dumb, didn't see the blue post 2hrs ago

Good pvp players can easily become good pve players, but the reverse is not necessarily true.

There are some [gnomes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jOTvnK0kbs) out there too.

# &lt;MOONSHOT&gt; (EU-HORDE-PVP] Hardcore PvE &amp; PvP
---
 Moonshot is a bunch of people who have been playing WoW competitively for many years in some of Europes’ (and the world’s) top #10 guilds. Our roster is composed of players who are well known and respected in the WoW community; some from retail, some from private servers, and some from both. Recently, with Classic getting closer, we have decided to join forces and start working on this project together.  
---
**What we look for**  
---
We are looking for motivated and dedicated players with impressive vanilla experience, who are willing to put in the hours, and are looking for a place to both PvE and PvP in competitively. We will take note of applicants who will be giving a little extra; stream, administrate, create content, and others who possess any skills that will help the guild grow.  
---
Our goal isn’t just to be another top-caliber PvE guild, but to also create a powerful community.  
---
**Raiding**  
---
2 times a week (20:00-24:00\~ CEST). 3rd day during progress (If needed).  
---
Wednesday-Thursday (+Sunday/Monday). Loot Council.  
---
1st MC clear will be on the end of the 2nd week / start of 3rd week of launch.  
---
**PvP**  
---
BG groups will be led by experienced veterans who have proven their prowess in rated PvP and in leadership throughout the expansions. We will be pushing rank 14s, and people who would want to join some of us on the rank farm, once the Honor System is out, will be welcome to do so if requirements are met. Those groups will not be limited to non-raid days only. WPvP/Wbosses will be a main focus for us, and we're going to collaborate with other top Horde guilds to battle the Alliance and create an epic PvP environment in our realm.   
---
**Currently Recruiting**:

&gt;ut. Also helps that i main a dwarf and they look 100 times better than they did in classic. Again just my opinion though.
---
Classic wow = night elves
---
Retail wow = Pixies
---
&gt;mobs have “longer range aka leeway” 
---
for only 2 points. and its an extra hit  even if it doesnt crit.  Arms is best for leveling but definately grab the cruelty talent anyway
---
These last ~16 years must have been hard for you.
---
If you take damage from PvP and die you drop the chests.
---
I played that build a lot and it had extremely weak healing if you were actually wearing tanking gear, the healing was practically non-existent.  The reason it was great for PVP was because the damage wasn't as high in PVP, so things like sacred shield were much more powerful.  That's why it was only good for small scale PVP and not like 15v15s, because you not only couldnt heal that but also couldnt tank that kind of damage.
---
I get what you're saying but it really wasn't a viable build for PVE.  For PVP it absolutely is a perfect (and one of the only) example of hybrid class.
---
also i will make fun of you in guild if you dont know you class yet and raiding Kappa :P
---
Yea, if I saw a 1650 rating item or higher it was almost an auto invite I think.
---
I like the Orc change too. Female Orcs in Classic look retarded (and I'm planning on maining one).
---
also in short if you want caster play mage :) if you want mele play warrior ez
---
Because Blizzard is going to consider adding new content to Classic to keep subscription numbers high. I am of the opinion that adding content to Classic is a better alternative to TBC. Do you think this idea would incentive World PvP.
---
Pathetic.

That means that R1 Lesser Heal, learned at L1, receives a 0.2875 multiplier for +Healing, on top of the regular coefficient. So with +700 Healing, R1 Lesser Heal would only heal for 195 with the penalty, instead of 551 if it wasn't factored in.
---
This is why Lesser Heal is never used at L60, because it scales so poorly. This is also why R1 Flash of Light is so powerful, because it's learned at exactly L20 and doesn't suffer any penalties, but still costs only 35 mana.
---
Certain classes have it easier / better than others level 1-10 (and so on)
---
Warlocks? You can juggle two mobs at once without issue. It's faceroll easy. It's almost depressing how easy it is compared to other classes. 
---
Druid? Eh, it's kind of tough. You're pretty much always oom with every pull and it can be a pain in the ass until you're around level 6. Shit gets way easier, although kind of slow, once you get bear form.
---
My advice is to pair up with a friend and duo level. You'll accomplish some quests easier with a partner, tag mobs faster and more reliably, and you'll be protected from "bad luck" when you're questing.
---
You can't even hold a million gold in Classic.
---
How the FK did I miss that...That was awesome. Now I am even more convinced that Blizzard is turning all the wheels for Classic, and we will all get the version we prefer.
---
without armour, female orcs in retail look better, with armour though, including helm, they look better in classic, they have a more defined shape and funnly enough look more built (when wearing armor) due to the shape of their ribcage

Re-iterating what Greenarrow992 said - the *Beta: World of Warcraft Classic* item is there so you can uninstall it. Presumably you were in the Stress test but not the Beta. If so then select that item and then in the drop-down options menu (under the logo at the top of the launcher) choose Uninstall Game.
---
If you were in the Beta leave it alone.

I'll stick to classic rock and deathcore

Idk im very nostalgic about Zangarmarsh ... Aesthetics and music were so tranquil...
---
As a busy dad, I know I won't see any raid content. I will see some 5 man action. Can't wait to play a druid and bear tank.
---
Wow cool I haven't seen this anywhere.  Thanks
---
Maybe not a reason at all, but they did get a lot of us to download the game early, and on a Tuesday when they usually have download traffic on patch days anyway
---
Interesting. I don't remember us wiping many times at all after we learned the fight. Maybe we used different kind of positioning as it definitely would've taken a few seconds for Raz to get to the priest in case of early break. Tank should be able to emergenzy shieldwall taunt it when it happens and have the other priest quickly take back control.
---
They are on the vendors.
---
And they all have bonus shadow resistance as a racial just to rub it in more
---
What he's suggesting doesn't require loot trading though, he made a mistake in bringing it up.
---
He means "Can I go solo everything and then pass on the loot, thereby allowing someone standing at the entrance to win the roll on it".  And as I understand it, the answer is 'yes'.
---
I think there are better ways to promote pvp than just "randomly explore the world". The Gurubashi chest worked well because everyone knew *where* it spawned and everyone knew *when* it spawned. The game directed players to one specific location so of course a fight would start. If the chests spawn randomly than interacting with other players will only be limited to random encounters.
---
And I think this content in its current form incentivizes hearthing *far* too much.
---
Can we add ushers Yeah for every W?
---
No they don't. I watch both subs. They get downvoted into oblivion. Criticism is a separate thing entirely. Theres way more blind hate on this sub towards modern WoW than there is from the mothersub to classic WoW.
---
I agree man. Streamers don’t really bother me that much, apart from Asmon and especially soda, it’s really the mindless horde of followers who turn global chat into twitch chat.
---
I don't see it:

---
Nochanges finds it's own damn food
---
Yes, but one is 100% guarnteed in 1 day of play.  And one is a x% drop in a raid with 10 people who might want it as well.
---
For the most part the pvp gear was 'one tier below', but had way more stamina.  Sometimes stamina was good in raids too.
---
Nope. https://i.imgur.com/XIBW1Y5.png
---
Rogues can fill the Scout/Crowd Control role really well in team play. They can set up the best first strikes and make room for the rest of the party to do massive damage while the enemy is distracted in the shuffle.
---
A worthy choice, but I’ll have the LoTR extended trilogy playing on a loop on my tv.
---
No changes
---
And what's the context? Anything can be labelled as subjective if you wish to see it so. But the formula is there: shards are used for strong spells, or X (work) leads to Y (reward). 
---
And people can definitely disagree, but "meh too many buttons, too much grind, lol lmao rofl, mage pwnz" isn't a real argument in this context. With the same attitude I can say I prefer strawberry to chocolate, cause that's my opinion (period). And people would disagree not because I'm necessary wrong, but because my comment doesn't reflect the context.
---
And what's the context here? Right, how powerful are warlocks. And shards and curses are most definitely not drawbacks, even if you don't like them.
---
I need THUNDERHORN
---
&gt; vanilla wow is not about raiding
---
It's about dancing naked on top of the IF mailbox for tips
---
Sometimes it is that simple.
---
Did it matter what starting zone and class you chose?
---
Spektrumwow
---
...they were called mara princess. As opposed to mara orange/purp.
---
Click on where it says "World of Warcraft Classic" ...
---
They'll be too far away to be eligible to roll on the loot or be given the loot through Master Looter.
---
By spamming regrowth and chugging mana pots / runes.
---
You spec into Nature's Grace with something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxf0xoZZxecocaV) and take Improved Regrowth in the Resto tree.  Regrowth already has a high crit chance and those talents increase it by 50%.  
---
Nature's grace makes it so that every crit reduces your next cast by .5 seconds.  This means that if you're spamming Regrowth, which has a base cast time of 2 seconds at all ranks, you will effectively have a near permanent 1.5 second cast time on your heals.  This makes your heals some of the fastest in the game and competitive with the other healers.  With the T2 set bonus your heals will be 1.3 seconds.
---
Back in vanilla everyone sucked and the fights took a long time and so we had to prioritize efficiency, which is why druids spammed Rank 4 Healing Touch.  It's one of the (if not the) most efficient styles of healing in the game, but it's also a super long cast time which is why Druids got out-healed by everyone else and gained the reputation of being bad healers.
---
Nowadays though players are much better and the content is theory-crafted to death.  Everyone knows what gear to use, what buffs, world buffs, perfect DPS rotations etc so the fights are shorter and you have more mana so you can afford to be less efficient.  Spamming Regrowth is hell on your mana which is why you have to bring mana pots and runes to chug on CD.  Some guilds will even let you Innervate yourself if the priests don't need it which makes this strategy even more effective.
---
You can't do it on every single fight because there are long fights where you need to watch your mana but you can do it on most of them and make the priests cry when you top them on the charts.
---
the arms in classic wow, are pushed back more, allowing for a greater gap/distinction for the Ribcage/waist to be more easily seen due to how far apart the Arms hang in comparison to the body, this excentuates the Curves and shape design when using armor. (the shape is nicer, the textures arent, which is why i prefer classic model, when wearing low resoultion gear)
---
Amazing if true, tbh. That fixes more or less every outstanding flaw Layering has shown in the beta.
---
...jesus
---
No one just says “lfg DM” unless they are actually looking for a deadmines group so this whole point is moot. For dire maul the acronym is always followed by which wing so there is no confusion unless you are a brainlet
---
If playing the game feels like a chore then go do actual chores...then playing won't leave such a guilty residue.
---
The Gurubashi chest event is just a zergfest. I think its great, but a lot of players prefer small scale PvP. 1v1s, 2v2s.. That is just how gamers are nowadays. Battlegrounds don't really offer that, which is why a lot of players are going to get bored of them. Why do you think World PvP videos are so popular? You get to see a single player take on multiple enemies in the open world. Having a risk/reward associated with the treasure chests could make it more fun. 
---
Do you hearthstone home with your 2 chests or do you keep hunting for more and risk dying? If you hearthstone, you will either have to wait an hour or go back hunting for chests without the ability to get out of danger.
---
there's no way to answer how valuable pickpocketing is in vanilla until BRD is possible.
---
i can tell you this though, Rogue's Diary vendors for 1/20th of the pserver value in classic.
---
&gt;I can say I prefer strawberry to chocolate, cause that's my opinion (period). And people would disagree not because I'm necessary wrong, but because my comment doesn't reflect the context.
---
No, no, back up, you almost had it right there!
---
You prefer strawberry (me too!) And others prefer chocolate! There's no right answer! Because it's *subjective*. Just like beauty, attraction, life experiences... 
---
I hope one day you'll realize it's not always right vs wrong in every single possible situation, sometimes people just are the way they are. What I find enjoyable will be different from what you find enjoyable. And without that we would all be the same people, no diversity, very little innovation.  Its one of the most beautiful realizations when you say "wow, even though I hate ______ ,  the people who do like it are still needed .
---
Priest with greater magic wand and wand spec
---
ah the reason why I started to play wow because of that episode.  Little did I know 14yrs later :P
---
I just looked up quest reward sword and maces today, so good timing. This looks useful. I'd suggest looking into maces too. You can get one from RFC from a quest thrall gives you, long before you have to worry about weapon spec. There is also one in thousand needles from a longer chain that can be solo easy enough.
---
Not a ton of weapon upgrade opportunities so the more options there better. Daggers even make great offhand until you've spec'd into swords.
---
The starter version is free, just get a sub on the US realms and that should get you in. But there will be an EU stress test in July.
---
Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to be the first characters I've ever rolled!
---
Race: Human
---
Class: Warrior
---
Spec : Arms
---
PS,
---
And yes I know specializations don't technically exist.
---
Hey it doesn't seem you two have met, let me introduce you to my good friend and a great guy,  A Joke.
---
I had two 60s in vanilla and only raided up to MC. My brother raided naxx up to KT. Raiding was there for the no lifers.
---
Less DPS and the utility you could bring was made up in players that were the same class as you, but in a different role (typically healing).
---
Judging by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sIBNxQd6xw video it looks like you CAN use modifier=alt
---
I just jack it into my skull...then become a wet noodle, and pray I didn't fall in too bad of a condition.
---
&gt; I feel pretty sorry for the people who are tricked into thinking they can raid in a hardcore guild as a meme spec
---
This never happens. People don't say meme specs are HARDCORE GUILD viable. Keep crying about downvotes.
---
Min maxers seem to primarily come from PVE servers...which are for pussies.
---
Is there a class that can't raid?
---
Pre raid BIS -_-
---
Nice, your plan will take awhile 😄. I will do a main (priest) and probably just a lvl 5 alt (or 35 if i level faster than anticipated) for extra cash. 
---
In vanilla I had a few 60s but on different servers... The fun of rolling a newly released server always got me.
---
Scouting is tricky. The rogue is basically having a miniadventure while the rest of the party watches, and if he gets caught then he can easily die to an encounter designed for 4 man party.
---
Stop asking this question. I don't think you know how the operating system or the games work. Do some research on Google and figure it out
---
I thought they were supposed to stress the servers, not the playerbase
---
What about the players who just randomly stumble across a chest? This system seems just as likely to get them out of the world as it is to get other players into the world.
---
There are plenty of systems already in place that promote small scale PvP. Rare mobs, resources, farming spots, etc. Getting people out into the world is as easy as just making that stuff more valuable. If you want scaling risk I think there are better ways to go about getting it.
---
They do. I am on both subs too. There is more hate here for obvious reasons but people upvote all sorts of bs about classic too.
---
Next thing you know they are going to port it your phone. Maybe that's the WoW mobile game they are working on.
---
I know it's possible on private servers. No clue how or if it'll work on Classic.
---
I'd imagine they'll be quite far behind simply due to power. 
---
Vega 10 APUs don't get above 25W.

I forgot how shit the music was, thanks for reminding.

Any idea when we can start the download? I am on shitty internet and would love to get a head start while I am away for the day.

Its a cover

lol hell no

it's $15 to play for a few hours. I cancelled my subscription immediately after starting it
---
Lol.

You said that, from the perspective of Night Elves, even adult humans are shotas.

Stop deflecting.

So much dumb.

I was thinking more guilds who could clear it. We had 4 then we had another 5 or 6 who were stuck on emps or c'thun. With maybe 4 more stuck at princess
---
I thought pick lock was level 16? Not that anyone will be picking locks though.
---
Most things by Sublime are.
---
Im not a believer, I’m going to need to experience it first hand. 
---
I imagine it’s like washing a pan with water but never touching the debris inside with your hand or a sponge. Sure most of it comes off if it isn’t burnt on, but you still have some there. 
---
I need my ass super clean at peak performance 24/7
---
it’s not a super high end graphical game. You’re buzzing out man
---
Please let there be oceanic
---
I always remember Athene being carried by a fanboys.
---
yes but you don't get the wand till 8 at the earliest on a fresh server solo. Make it faster but not by as much as if it isn't fresh.
---
You could possibly sell the hit rating ring out of mauradon to lvl 60 rogues and warriors. That’s a popular one.
---
&gt;Even the worst farmer 
---
aka the people not using dm exploits
---
Let's be honest here, Vanilla was the first draft of WoW. 
---
Certain classes feel incomplete. 
---
Warriors get taunt and AoE abilities at level 10. 
---
Druids get Taunt and AoE abilities at level 10. 
---
Paladins never get access to a Taunt and they can get one AoE ability if they specc 11 points into Holy. 
---
When it comes to balance, players want to be able to do the job that the game advertised and said they could do. 
---
They want paths that the developers laid out to them to actually lead somewhere. How disappointed would a player making a paladin in Classic be when he finds out he's actually one of the worst tanks in the game and has to work 2x as hard as the other two?
---
This is the reason I am on reddit tonight. I am excited and panicking at the same time!
---
It is until you remember that professions give perks. Why should the engineer get to have engineering only items but the alch can't use a pot he made?
---
Woah sweet I was able to find some characters of mine from 06.  Too bad blizzard wasn’t able to get me my account back. Wonder if this could help in any way.
---
Sadly..was going to make a rogue just to pickpocket BRD.. not happening now.
---
Then try, and become a believer. Join us! We are legion!
---
On some servers VC caught on as, "I am specifically doing the quest for the head of Van Cleef, so only respond if you can finish Deadmines" since it was common for Deadmines runs to fail (either through wiping, or people misjudging time), since it was the alliance newbie dungeon.
---
And in some cases the name stuck for the dungeon in general.
---
I assume this wasn't the case for RFC because it was a shorter and easier introduction to dungeons, but I didn't play Horde.
---
Control of the middle is important when you can get the flag and be out the door into the middle of the map in 8s.
---
thankyou for ur well tailored response!
---
&gt; Naxx had few easy bosses.
---
remember most guilds could not kill rag. If you were wiping to rag you probably couldn't even clear the trash let alone kill a boss.
---
I'm trying to find the original post, but blizzard said they remade naxx for WotLK because almost no one, as a percentage, got to experience it
---
You can already download the game. You may have to restart your [battle.net](https://battle.net) client.
---
Issue of "it is beta" is that betas for games have pretty much become the game's demo. Some games live and die by their beta due to both developers and players treating it as the final product, which leads to more of an emphasis on developers showing alpha/pre-alpha gameplay (when a few years ago it would be considered beta) at conventions since beta is now a replacement for demo.
---
your right, i will still enjoy the game, this is just for my personal curiosity, since not many people have 240hz screens, so i wanted it to be tested.
---
I agree with you that there are already tons of farm spots in the open world. That is one of the best aspects of Classic WoW, and why a lot of the World PvP happens.
---
The difference with the treasure hunt system, is that the chests drop on death in PvP. There is this risk/reward associated with them. Imagine the thrill ganking another player and looting a bunch chests off them. Then hitting the jackpot from one of the chests you unlockk while in Stormwind. In Classic, when you kill players in World PvP you only get a small amount of honor. The reward is minimal. At best you are able to steal the resource node they are farming.
---
Yeah, but the arms being behind the back like that looks so unnatural and uncomfortable.
---
All these twitch streamers can go cry me a fuckin river
---
If you're alliance you don't have to deal with paladins dispelling your stuff constantly.
---
If you're horde you don't have to deal with WotF. 
---
I've heard people say it's actually not too bad being alliance.
---
No one farms DM in Retail.
---
And they're not exploits.
---
I'm mad about welfare gear.
---
Even if you discount raiding - which is laughable - you're still left with dungeons.
---
And guess what? In a 5-man team, your performance actually matters **much more** than in a 20-40 man team.
---
It's not "elitist" to want people to pull their weight and not waste time of FOUR other people.
---
You're right. Wowhead bug.
---
Nice to hear, would like to go alliance aswell. Ret Pala or feral Druid it is for me , i like the challenge with such a off meta specc and i think i can pull it off . Did play a rogue back then until aq40 .
---
Chuck norris stole her
---
Some places have separate vacation days and sick days. Some people have PTO that is used whether you are sick or on vacation.
---
I am also an altoholic and have been thinking about my strategy. You've actually helped me out a lot with your ideas, and i think the ideas about helping others is really great.
---
One thing I can comment on, is that you plan to drop engineering after 30, on 3 caster alts. That's going to be quite a bit of ruining around lower areas to level up gathering professions and time that won't be spent on leveling
---
Back then i was a good kid, perfect grades in middle school, going to a good highschool,was the smart kid in class. Now im a college dropout with no ideas on what to do in life, with classic wow the only thing im realy interested in. So no, this is way worse.
---
We need a radioactive class. Mini bullet aura.
---
Hope he's a Skinner, otherwise.... all those innocent raptors killed for nothing...
---
Grinding dungeons all the way to 60 100%. Getting to 14 or w/e you need to be to start running rfc is a slog but dungeons seem to be significantly easier than they are on pservers so you should have no problem aoeing stuff down. 
---
I’m heavily optimizing my leveling route for multiboxing because I’m going to be 40 boxing so I’ll have to level sets of 5 many times, so I’m going to be doing some quests but the overwhelming majority of my xp will come from just killing mobs in dungeons.
---
btw, before level 14put two points into arcane subtlety on all of your mages. It reduces arcane threat by 40% and you should be spamming the hell out of arcane explosion
---
As long as you’re having fun, you’re good 👍
---
It's a portal between worlds, you are transporting yourself to the World of Warcraft... that's probably about it. It's just a relevant splash screen to show that you're entering another world.
---
It’s okay to admit you didn’t know this. I only just learned it now :)
---
Simple, you just don't bind everything.
---
Imagine believing you need split second precision in a tab-target, predominantly PvE game with server ticks of 0.4.
---
People who "bind everything" probably also have gaming chairs. Just because they *think* you need to bind everything doesn't mean it's actually the case.
---
No joke I literally lost my virginity to a girl who I met at a party thrown by one of my raid leaders. He happened to live pretty close to me and a couple other raiders, so he threw a party with some other friends of his from college and she and I hit it off a couple months later. 
---
Probably met about 15 different people from WoW irl, still talk to some occasionally too. Good times man
---
Hots are trash because only 1 exists at any time for all classes of that type.  Its a cluster fuck of 'stronger effect' and no one bothers.
---
Hots are great in 5 mans.
---
ogar*
---
You know Ska came before Reggae?
---
Im pretty sure most of Preach's fanbase agree with the idea that they are seperate games.
---
right...  that is why blizzard tried to patch it a dozen times
---
I still read that as AssCandy, even now 😝
---
Maybe it wasn't the first server he played?  Beta was also a thing.  As was google
---
yeah its unnatural true, but when you look at superman or wonderwomen, theyre all pushing out their chest with confidence, very uncomfortable, but it makes for an interesting shape design which i find more appealing
---
Oh please god no.
---
Only once asmon beats him in a duel
---
`var result = wearingDress ? 'F' : 'M';`
---
le sigh @ PvE server
---
Yes. (Sold mine 500 euros.)
---
Id rather not have classic specs, id prefer MoP. GIMME BACK MY OLD WARLOCK! D:
---
Pickpocketing is definitely nice at the beginning. Being able to buy a stiletto dagger from the vendor and all your skills when you reach Razor Hill is very nice, I realize you’ll probably be rolling alliance but I think the same will apply. 
---
I recommend pickpocketing NPCs in combat with other players, kinda like a drive by. You can run up unstealthed, pop stealth for just a moment, grab the silver, unstealth and be on your merry way.
---
What does this mean?  You can retrieve old characters and start out max level at the release??
---
I /who them first to see if they're on, then res. Saves some time, especially in a high PVP area where many people ragequit
---
i fucking wish.
---
Accurate
---
Go Holy/Reckoning. Heal, stack reck, put on 2 hander, 1 shot mofos. Be useful.
---
&gt; TL;DR: Many people won't ever even hit 60, so until then at least make sure you're having fun with the game. 
---
except leveling sux ass
---
raiding is all that matters
---
I always liked to play what I called "The Sampler" 17/17/17
---
You only need 2 prot warriors in a 40 man raid.  Fury warriors will collect tank gear to manage the other fights as off tanks that require many of them.  
---
Very very few people will be going prot.
---
Sheep the pally or put fel puppy on him and fear chain. Bubble is prob on 5 min CD, if not, wait it out then LOL at flash of light
---
Eww gross
---
If your using a name likely to grabbed before you, is it really a good name?
---
The game doesn't need support for 240 Hz. You either have the hardware to reach those numbers or you don't. I played on the stress test with a 144 Hz monitor and the appropriate framerate just fine. If you're not registering framerates above 60 Hz, try going into your display settings to change the refresh rate.
---
I only healed as a paladin in Vanilla but from what I recall priest healing was very different in raids and in 5 mans.
---
In raid Priests were focused more on AOE and burst healing, shielding. the rest of the time they were pure wanding mana regen via judgement of wisdom on the boss. Paladins would spam lower ranks heals like machine guns. A druid or two would just innervate the main priest and heal other healers and HOTing tapping warlocks. 
---
In a 5 man the full toolkit would come out with the renews, downranks, shields and 5 sec rule.
---
Until the streamer moves on to another game, or gets tired of being stream sniped by the same guy and moves servers.  Then all his fanbois move too and your server goes to crap.
---
&gt; It's partly to Save on respect costs and the hassle of it.
---
Totally worth it to grind 180 extra hours for aa second priest to 60 instead of farming for like... 2 hours to respec then respec back.
---
Errm, im EU player, and i got it in my launcher, installed the game, see the serverlist (down ofc), but i have NO US account or any thing.  
---
Launcher is also set to English (UK) in general, so not sure why every one is writing about, US only..
---
So you may look again, restart the launcher, all i did was restart it after it told me it got an update, and i saw that the Version was World of Warcraft, but beside that i now nad an Account, where i can pick any of the WoW Account i have, But under Version i do see World of Warcraft Classic.
---
I have a 9700k and 2080 ti and can't even keep 144 in all scenarios on the Beta on Ultra settings.
---
That's actually the spec I came up with when determining how I want to play classic. Go deep enough to get the windfury improvement and then the rest into resto. That way I can still solo quest or heal 5 mans ect.
---
Get better gear.
---
It's 1/4 the mana bar.
---
You never level in a healing spec. Once you are 60 and raiding it is very common to have a farming ALT with the proper spec.
---
You only needed 8% hit, which if my memory serves, was 142 hit, extremely easy for me, as a BM hunter, to hit.  It was less that there was less hit on higher tier gear, and more that it had more hit per piece, so you needed it on less pieces to accomplish the same amount of hit.
---
As for mages, I'm almost positive every single class valued being hit capped for raiding before any other stat.  Misses/resists would massacre you on DPS compared to an equally geared player who was capped and never missed.
---
&gt; 'its scripted bro'
---
I told my raids that shit *daily*, lol.  "Why are we wiping?  This is literally scripted you dolts".  Man, I miss making bank selling Amani Warbears, 10k a pop, 3 runs a week, split between 9 carry raiders was fairly lucrative.  We were even nice enough to put the odd thousand into the gbank after everyone else got their 1k cut.
---
Man, I miss BC more than Classic.  I'm *super* hyped for Classic, but I really hope in 2-3 years we get a BC offshoot that our Classic characters can migrate to.
---
All i distincly remeber was its worse than crip poison at some point I never really pvp'd so i never cared about hamstring to much
---
I tailored my response well in your last post about this.
---
I've played vanilla on PvP servers many times and here's the following reasons why I can't stand it: 
---
I play a paladin. we suck at leveling on pvp servers. we are free honor.
---
groups camping dungeon entrances
---
people troll dispelling zg world buff, yes they die for it but they dont care.
---
endless ganking.
---
i cant.
---
A popular opinion doesn’t mean a circlejerk
---
I did indeed, thanks!
---
Plot twist, it was the power supply.
---
id say an engineer using dynamite or his items in a duel is also stupid but valid in pvp
---
so at 144hz, you didint experience screen tearing? 
---
on private server at 300fps, it wouldnt allow me to go above 60hz, so on private serveers, it wasnt hardware related, it was game related. so on private serveers i was at 300fps, but the game only allowed 60HZ (just clariying u know that HZ and fps are 2 different things)   
---
So are u saying at 144hz, and 144fps, you were expereincing true 144hz and not 60hz at 144fps? thankyou in advance :)
---
How's the 1v1 potential? Reckoning seems much less effective against ranged?
---
Very unfamiliar with the build.
---
&lt;PUG United&gt;[H][US][Realm Not Picked][PvE &amp; PvP]

If you find yourself here your Hearthstone must be on cool down because we are on our way home. Classic World of Warcraft is returning and Azeroth will be as it should. But, can we really go back home? All of us share a common story of making friends in WoW and forging terrific memories &amp; bonds while traveling across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Tragically, those guilds are long since disbanded so who do we quest with now? Who shall accompany us as we descend into a raid bosses lair? Did you plan to level solo or with a friend and see how things worked out? Was your plan to pug your way through dungeons and hope for the best? Well, wonder no more. This is a time to forge new friendships and to make new memories. Don’t just be some pug… be THE PUG!
---
PUG United is led by Classic veterans (Excellent references available upon request) who know that the true mark of original WoW was the community. In keeping with this, we are a social guild that plans to tackle every drop of content classic has to offer.
---
A Quick About US
---
• For the Horde!
---
•Semi-Hardcore because we understand that there are other constraints on your time and flexibility is a two way street.

• The guild is led by Classic WoW experienced players. This includes a Raid Leader who downed both C’Thun and KT before Burning Crusade launched. We plan to clear all Classic raid content and when we are ready to expand, add a second raid group.

• We will be focused on the social aspect of what made Classic great the first go around. The pride that one used to have in their guild and their realm begins again. We will always be focused on building the kind of community and camaraderie that is the very best of what WoW and MMORPGs have to offer.
---
• We will be playing on a PvP server because let’s be honest…it is just more fun. We plan to level in groups and with no honor being up for grabs at launch that should deter most people from attacking you. PvP will be a primary focus both for World and Battlegrounds.
---
• Raiding: Woah, easy there! You got to hit 60 first! Once we get to 60 the reality is we will need to start grinding out BiS items from all the 5-Mans and UBRS. This gives us ample time to settle on a raid schedule as a lot can happen between now and then. Rest assured, we plan to finish every raid Classic has to offer. Raid spots will be earned by those who show up. We want to foster a guild that stands for each other. Raid times will be evenings on weekdays and weekends.
---
• DKP will be a zero-sum system and is awarded for time spent in raid. If you haven’t used a zero-sum system, it is the fairest way to ensure that everyone gets geared. We are a team and when one of us wins, we all win! Only select items such as prerequisites for legendary weapon will be set to officer discussion and will ultimately go to the best choice to help the guild.
---
All that is required of our members is to show up with a positive attitude and a helpful hand for your fellow guild members. If you want to be the most hardcore raider the server has to offer, that is great. If you want to pick every herb and mine every node then you do what makes you happy. There is no “right” way to have fun in this game. We plan to be a home for all, do you wish to rebind your Hearthstone?
---
You can feel free to reply to me here or to add me at WildGunmen#1302. We, like everyone else, will be using Discord to communicate. This not only will make the launch smoother but will allow us to start building our community socially. Members like you will be what set us apart. May your axe arm be mighty!

Naxxramas was released June 19, 2016.
---
TBC, which we all knew would raise the level cap and obsolete all gear, was announced in September to release on January of the next year. ([Source](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_(World_of_Warcraft))
---
For most guilds active in raiding at that time this was a guild killer; Naxxramas was insanely difficult and there was no point if the gear would be useless 3 months later. (Also, it was known that TBC would have 25 man raiding content, and you can imagine the impact that announcement had on guilds who tried to keep an active core roster of ~40 players: 15 of them would have to form a B raid group or another guild...)
---
Warriors are the best scaling class. They Scale with gear exponentially. They also scale amazingly with a healer/dispeler. 
---
In most 1v1 in vanilla, luck played a big component. A resist or a mad crit would decide the encounters. Some classes were weaker against others but RNG still played a role.
---
&gt;If you play a mutliplayer FPS with an aimbot, people do care because your cheating ruins the game for others.
---
TIL people like you equate twinking to literally cheating with aimbots.
---
"The difference which you apparently don't want to comprehend is that PvPing at low level is legitimate play while cheating is exactly that, fucking cheating"
---
Get bent.
---
Give me back my breath! &gt;:(
---
Doesn’t matter what class you play when an above average player is going against average players
---
Also remember the name. That was in every pvp video for a long while.
---
I'm surprised by that. I have a Ryzen 2600 at 4.1 Ghz and could hit those frames. However, it wasn't extremely populated when I was on cruising around the zone. Have you changed the Max Foreground FPS?
---
You missed out on the goat expansion
---
I have a job and a life, so I'm going to hold my nose and make it to 60 and then camp Stonetalon and Thousand Needles for fun while I sip on some good Scotch. Sound like an asshole? Yeah, pretty much...I'm an attorney.
---
You think you do, but  you don't.
---
I sneak into NASA and use their computers but I dunno guys I dont think it can run Classic in a 5 man, might have to sneak an upgrade
---
That's cringey as fuck.
---
so, it's the only people you can beat lol.
---
Fixed my post to clarify but yeah I'm not speccing resto till at least 50. I'm fine with getting ganked while leveling, it's mostly the endgame money-making I'm worried about.
---
I still am not a fan of how MoP split feral druids into 2 different specs. If they never did that then I would like the way MoP handled things.
---
its a beta though, figuring out the cause of the bug shouldn't be considered an exploit it should be considered testing. imo the more harm it does to the beta players the more likely blizzard will actually fix it, i mean they didn't fix shit from bfa beta. so i say abuse the shit out of it. get people angry now, not later.
---
I look forward to camping all of your alts and hiding from your mains. Level 60 crappy geared rogue 4 ever
---
As some have mentioned range may be a restricting factor since you are not clearing the path for a low level character. It could be possible I guess for a stealthy to get to the boss and Hunter kill the boss but unless he is twinking I don't see ppl paying good gold for an item to be replaced even 10 levels down the road.
---
I ran a strictly healer build with a priest. The first 18 levels can be tough but I went to all three starting zones to level so I was fine. Once I hit instances, it's just easy. I'd heal Deadmines till 22 or 23, then move on to wailing caverns/shadowfang keep. Then BFD, etc. It's pretty easy to keep up and while my dps was a little low, I was generally over leveled and had BiS virtually the entire time.
---
This also means that world PvP, afk ganking, is pretty survivable since you can out heal anything they throw at you until you escape or they get bored and run away (unless they are way high level, in which case, you die).
---
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was (in comparison to leveling a mage).
---
It was also difficult for many players who expected level 60 balance changes (some classes were due for their talent revamps) and Blizzard threw the towel by forgoing their promise and just moving on to new skills, combat systems and level cap.
---
&gt; The Ironbark Protectors in Dire Maul West now have an Entangle Root spell that lasts for ~12 seconds.
---
&gt; Magister Kalendris has been moved in to the middle of the hall.
---
&gt; Guard Slip'kik's patrol path has been altered.
---
&gt; Tendris Warpwood will now call upon any protectors still alive to aid him.
---
&gt; Dire Maul has had several spawn locations changed and a slight increase in population.
---
&gt; The Gordok Courtyard Key and the Gordok Inner Door Key are now zone bound items. These items only exist within the Dire Maul zone instance, and players will lose these keys from their inventory if they leave the zone.
---
Not a dozen and hardly an attempt to stop people from soloing some of the content, just enough to make it so overpowered in farming.
---
they didnt upgrade your account lol, you still need to buy BFA if you want to do anything.  (and im pretty sure theyve included all xpacs when you buy the new one in the last few releases)
---
Are you me?????
---
Buy a used computer for $7 and I bet you it will run it. 😁
---
Well specifically to overwatch, yeah they have a Hz setting, so you can be at 240hz at 1080 or 60hz at 2080, depending on the power of your screen, in private servers, they also had that setting, but whenever you would select 240hz, it would instantly set back to 60hz when you left the menu (meaning Private servers didint support this)  Thats why im curious if its changed in Classic Wow Beta. \*specifically software related not hardware, since i can run almost any game at 300fps\*
---
needs about a dozen more
---
Good job orange now you've been demonitized
---
Or by its real name the "Poo Poo Plater"
---
I played on dethecus as well! Tagteamz was my main toon. Started in bc though!
---
I didn't notice any tearing whatsoever. I didn't try running a refresh rate diagnostic program while I was playing because there were no visual impacts which would give me the indication of it running poorly. What do you mean by you couldn't go above 60 Hz? Where were you attempting to change that?
---
And now we all know you are one of them.
---
Never played alliance before so gonna be rolling dwarf pally and learning all the new lore
---
Can’t forget ‘Animal I have become’ while piping on your druid
---
Live Free or Die my 603 brothet
---
The blizzcon panels were what sold me. The announcement cinematic was cool but the panels in 2018 were what really sold me on them being into a faithful recreation.
---
You will be surprised how fast it is to level an ALT once you feed them bags, gold, and good gear for the class. You will have a lot of downtime here and there before raids and so forth. 
---
Put it this way, the extra time you spend trying to farm in a proper raid healing spec even with good gear is much better spent leveling a farming machine .... Vanilla is not a sprint it's a marathon.
---
LFMDM*
---
NO MORE!
---
Do we get to keep the character from the stress test for when classic launches? Or do they go away and we make new ones when they open up the character creation in August? I don’t expect we do but I want to be sure in case I need to put thought into my character’s appearance and name tomorrow.
---
when you press escape in Video game options, under the resolution tab, u can change the Hz, rate along with the resolution,  it should allow for a 240hz or 144hz (whichever ur screen resolution is) and allow you to set it to ur highest monitors Hz.  
---
The problem i experience on private servers (havent been in beta so i dont know) is that when i set it to the appropriate 240hz, it instantly sets back to 60hz when i close the options), which is why im curious wether Beta supports 240 or not.
---
Yeah, PvE servers suck, I agree. The playerbase also tends to suck, which I forgot to mention. 
---
One of the major reasons that this game is amazing is that there is the possibility of being killed by the opposing faction in every situation outside of being in an instance. It's vanilla, if you've played a Holy Paladin since vanilla, maybe just maybe roll with something else. 2 button healing get's kind of old after 15 or so years, no? There are plenty of other classes and specs to enjoy, Holy Paladins being easily one of if not the most bland class specs there is. Also, you wear plate, you have BoP, and can heal people in your group in the event you are being ganked. You have the advantage. 
---
PvE servers are great until you're at end game. Then you're playing with the trashcan people who can't deal with getting ganked. Cool, world PvP on a PvE server, how exciting................................................................................................................................................but no it really isn't. World PvP is great when it involved people who belong in world PvP, people who know how to play their classes in every situation, they mechanically and instinctfully know exactly what to do in every situation, they know not to fumble and faceroll on their keyboard when shit hits the fan in every situation, do you know why? Because they aren't fucking pussies that play on PvE servers.
---
That's prettymuch it, PvE servers have their purpose, it's to take all the no ball pussy shits and quarantine them from the real players so they can pick their flowers and mine their nodes without worry of someone hurting them. How fun. I'd rather play Tetris
---
says it was added in patch 1.13 but classic is gonna be patch1.12 so maybe its not changed
---
Yup, it is. They’re based on the *exact* same concept art
---
Incorrect, sorta. The second stress test we had that let us keep our toons was only done because there was more they wanted to test and they ran out of time previously. Tomorrow we wont have our old stress test toons, probably
---
Had a similar thought today that with all these posts and YouTube videos on how to "get ahead of the pack". I don't want to be "ahead" of the pack. I wanna be right around with it. Seems like that's when you'd have the easiest time grouping for dungeons and quests.
---
Does the Hunter have some fun gear to work towards?
---
Everything will get reset when Classic launches in August.

•Semi-Hardcore because we understand that there are other constraints on your time and flexibility is a two way street.
---
It actually does. All classes have different power spikes when it comes to skill level. Mages and Rogues come to mind. They power spike much later in the skill curve, where a half decent shadow priest or a hunter would juts wreck even at lower skill level.
---
Leeroy jenkins group wasnt roll playing other than the fact it was staged though, it would make more sense as a pve realm

Shit I just played Scatman for hours after watching the that famous RP funeral crashing video on that server.

**&lt;Maelstrom&gt; NA-PvP Alliance guild recruiting for Classic. We have been playing together on our private server for the past few months and cleared everything up to AQ40 with 20-35 players.**
---
**Our main goal is to have a fun community of skilled, mature and competitive players who love to play WoW Classic and other games alike. The vision of the guild is to be more than just a place where people show up to collect raid loot, but a place that gamers can call their home and treat their fellow guild-mates as their family.**
---
**While hardcore players are always welcome, we don’t expect everyone to no-life grind every day. We welcome people who are competitive but are also looking to have a healthy balance between video games and their real-life responsibilities.**
---
**With that said, we’re not casuals and this is not an excuse for a lack skill or dedication. We focus on quality over quantity and would like to keep this community as tight-knit as possible.**
---
**LOOT SYSTEM**
---
**We use a loot council system where officers distribute loot to raiders based on attendance, size of upgrade, performance inside/outside of raids, and an overall benefit to the progression of the guild. The goal is to make this process as transparent and fair as possible.**
---
**RAID TIMES**
---
**During progression, a typical raid week will consist of 9 hours / 3-night schedule: Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday @ 8-11pm Central Time. There will be phases when we only need 1-2 nights to clear all content. During our ‘off nights’ we will be running optional PvP or alt raid events. These days and hours may change based on holidays.**

Every warrior be like:

https://youtu.be/l7STHIrFHg0
---
It's been infrequent, but it happens. Usually in cities and some big wPVP. I imagine it'll be bad in raids too. It's also because I'm playing at 1440p. Thankfully G-Sync takes care of it.
---
cool, whatever floats yer boat
---
Fuck, I loved them.
---
So do you get better dps in the game if your fps is over 60 or something ? Is that why you keep asking this question...the only mmo game I know of that benefits from high fps 144+ is Black Desert Online.
---
Either you want to help people (commendable) or you'll a greedy, capitalist pig trying to make a quick buck, but I've never liked people that do things this. People like you contributed into making wow the current solo experience where everything is handed over to you if you don't want to put in the work. Even if you want to do it to be nice, it would be better for you to teach those ones the game and not just hand that stuff over (unless this is for twinks, in which case, that's fine).
---
I've been building a Playlist of songs that remind me of when I played when I was younger. My tastes were... Interesting. Artists range from Sean Paul to Matisyahu to Billy talent. But man this Playlist brings back some memories. It's insane how certain songs give such a visceral memory of a specific time and place in wow
---
oh lord...
---
Ahead of the pack doesnt mean world first. It just means ahead of the Zerg. I can assure you that nobody wants to be inside of the Zerg, it will be a very painful leveling process
---
Fucking classic vanilla song!
---
Same here I will enjoy raiding and all the endgame stuff if I can find a guild or people to play with but I will definitely enjoy leveling and experiencing it all.
---
No I can beat green and gray mobs too, the other players are just content to me but they have the added bonus of drama that NPCs cannot provide.
---
Joana does hunter leveling guides only. They are trash for anything but hunter
---
Poor baby doesn't like that people are better and more dedicated at the game than him so he goes crying to Blizzard. Waaaaaaah.
---
&gt; TIL people like you equate twinking to literally cheating with aimbots.
---
I gave you a really easy example and you still don't get it. Sad.
---
People don't like twinks because they spoil the game for everyone else. You are not a special, unique snowflake at the very centre of the universe and your feelings do not determine reality.  Other people matter too. 
---
If you still don't understand this perhaps you need to watch Sesame Street or some similar show that attempts to explain very basic ideas like this to people with very undeveloped brains.
---
Mine now.
---
You're a paladin. You're going to be less effective against ranged. Go Holy so you can heal, get reckoning so that you can also kill, and counter range as best you can via Engineering. You get a free mount, so level engineering all the way to 60. You'll use it.
---
using exploits makes you dedicated ?  lol
---
Small price to pay to play WoW.
---
In all seriousness though, I felt like a bad parent just keeping an eye on my kid at 4 months while playing MMO’s. Leaving them alone unattended for any amount of time was unfathomable.
---
Like how do you even reason with yourself that it’s ok to do for “even just an hour.” Like the parents said. Wtf man... people are shitty and fucking suck.
---
Darude - Sandstorm, on repeat.
---
Just got to open your mouth and meet people
---
I have 5 main complaints about TBC:
---
1) Daily Quests (the sunwell stuff took it too far)  
---
2) Flying Mounts (killed the world)  
---
3) Divided World (SW/IF was emtpy)  
---
4) Item level explosion (Naxx ~= T4, T6 ~= 10xNaxx)  
---
5) Pvp gear implementation (mostly ilvl related, but resilience + healing was bad)
---
Leveled as shadow priest.
---
I remained untouched
---
&gt;	Well kinda, sharding is used in a different way in retail than layering is on vanilla. Sharding was retails answer for dead low-pop servers to play with other people on highpop realms.
---
That is cross realm zones, not sharding.
---
Get 60. Stay on curve with content. Level an alt in the time I am not raiding/gathering mats.
---
They had the single target and AoE taunt in Vanilla? Wild
---
Lfm ubrs full on warriors and rogues dal rends on res
---
I played during Vanilla and my server was called Frostmourne.
---
It’s millions of players.
---
Eh I used his guide to speed level my Warlock and it was just fine.
---
Rise Against.  
---
BREAK THROUGH THE UNDERTOW...
---
Blizzard is the only entity that gets to call something an exploit and they determined farming Dire Maul is not an exploit.
---
Plot twist, the entire pc burst into flames because he cast fireball
---
That's because crippling poison is about the best snare.
---
Hamstring is on the lower end of snares at 50%.  However, an untalented Frostbolt is 40%, and Curse of exhaustion is only 30% (but they get no movement speed bonus while CoE is active, so a mounted player gets hit hard by it).
---
Hamstring wasn't bad.  It wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad.
---
Dude isn't that DIO?
---
You are right. Editing my original comment to hunters and warlocks
---
Oh ok, well see tomorrow then, since there was precedent i tought that was normal.
---
Im not sure, but specificaly with First person shooters, my aim is noticeably better, as its easier to track enemies movements, im sure theres some very smallll minor thing it would help with in an mmo, maybe health bars reefreshing faster, or something like that, very minor more quality of life change
---
&gt; Another brainlet who doesn't realize that in order to win games you also have to beat the twinks that were on the enemy team.
---
Using made-up baby words doesn't help your case. I think most grown-ups are emotionally mature enough to understand that twinks on your side are exactly as objectionable as twinks on the other side.
---
Blizzard should just put a token xp reward on battleground kills and wins and boot the twinks out into the next bracket.
---
&gt; also, I do compete in boxing and have had 3 fights so far
---
Relevance?
---
That seems incredibly false being as a mage won the duel tournament with an spriest in it. Rank 1 is rank 1. A simple class setback doesn’t phase those people against better classes placed by normal people. Simply put, a worse class played to its highest potential is better than the best class played half ass.
---
i know the pros and cons of holy paladins and i will for sure be playing one. i played on a pve server before and it was the best experience i had at endgame. much nicer community and very hardcore raiding guilds.  perfect for me.
---
On the Blizzard WoW Classic client there is no option to change the Hz in the tab that allows you to adjust the resolution.
---
Barbie Girl by Aqua.. Btw I'm rolling on a PvE realm
---
I have a huge community of mates playing classic.... they will likely level faster than me.. and the point of my post was that I'm excited to group with new people so I don't understand you comment?
---
That 10% rep bonus is awfully tempting though
---
All of this information essentially means nothing to me. But I appreciate that you so thoughtfully went through it all, and laid all of it out in the way that you did. This will allow me to reference your post to my buddy and he’ll be able to ELI5 it for me. Thank you!

---
1 doom weed an hour....once in a while you get to kill a mob along with the 4 other people that tagged it right after you did.
---
At least it will matter which pet you choose again
---
yeah this isnt a fps game, is what im gettin at. 300 fps isnt going to help you in world of warcraft almost zero difference, the only thing that would happen is prolly make the game a tad more crisp.
---
This means everyone else is carrying the difference between "Optimal" and "Viable". So with enough "Viable" in the raid the difference becomes "non-Optimal".
---
Yeah am tossing up between mage and priest at the moment. Pretty much for the same reasons you mentioned
---
I didn't have it and then my battle.net lowkey installed an update and asked I wanted to restart and when I did it was there.
---
Are you suggesting that your mount is Azeroth. That's silly...
---
they did by trying to change it
---
u lose
---
I recommend utilising the common shaman hybrid spec when you first spec into healer. You'll heal dungeons fine while maintaining more DPS while farming. Once you get pre raid BiS you can respec for progression since by then your gear while compensate for the DPS lost in the spec alteration
---
Hope your kid comes out alright!
---
Can confirm, 8 hour days were easy only years ago, 20 now and suddenly it's not that easy
---
It will be a updated fixed version of what we get tomorrow. They really don't care about bugs it's more about server stability.
---
just rp walk everywhere
---
Frostmourne isn't an item. (at least, not available to players)
---
It took me 8 months to reach level 60.
---
And that was the best 8 months of my life.
---
Understandable, but I feel like even in the worst case scenario, those specs were still better than BFA and Classic specs.
---
If they considered soloing DM an exploit, they would have just made a door at the very beginning that required 3, 4, or 5 people to click on before it opened.
---
You're an idiot.
---
You are confirming my point. I simply said that some classes have higher skill level to be average. The same average skilled player on a hunter or shadow priest will do way better than on a mage or a rogue.  Nothing to do with Rank 1.
---
Yeah doesn't everyone with an active sub get access for this stress test?
---
OK I'm gonna have a small rant here: do NOT use Frames-per-Second to measure performance. It's an inverse scale that becomes meaningless once you try say things like "the UI takes away 50FPS". 
---
To take your example: let's say you get 450 FPS without the UI, and 400 with.
---
Those FPS numbers are instant inverses (i.e. they're 1/frame_time).
---
Without UI, that would give you a frame rendering time of 2.22ms.
---
With UI, that gives you 2.5ms.
---
That is, the time it takes to rendering the UI is ~0.27ms. That's not a lot!
---
If your computer can only render at 30 FPS, then the UI rendering time of 0.27ms will only represent .8% of your total frame time (which is 33ms).
---
TL;DR: you cannot use FPS to evaluate the relative impact of a feature on rendering performance; you can only use frame time.
---
(That is a PSA from a graphics engineer to all misinformed gamers.)
---
One needs tailoring and costs like 400g and one is a drop only the healer in the group wants?
---
As I told you before, this likely just capped the frame rate of the game.
---
It's sad to see how the worlds best paladin ended up.
---
&gt;Binds when picked up
---
Even if the bosses were easy the trash was not :)
---
And everyone you meet, ask if they've heard the tragedy of Darth Murloc the Wise.  It's not a story the Gnolls would tell you.
---
I don't always identify as a attack helicopter, sometimes I identify as this
---
A peer support specialist? Lol wtf
---
Both of those were my entire vanilla experience. Also red flag by billy talent
---
I WANT THEM ALL TO TASTE THE BOAR THAT GOT ME
---
I don't agree at all. I've done his guide on many classes haven't tried warr though I imagine it's a pain questing no matter what. 
---
It's a speed questing guide , obviously the classes with pets will excel, but by no means is it "trash" for other classes. 
---
Tbh the less people on the route, the better for me though, so yeah it's shit! XD
---
And?
---
Oh shit. I didn't realize you were retarded. Sorry man.
---
If it's not viable, it's not optimal.
---
If it's not optimal, it's not viable.
---
Sounds right to me.
---
Not at the expense of 39 other people...go have fun on your own time...
---
Yes let me go kill mobs 5-7 levels above me. And elites 6 levels above me. Sounds fantastic as a melee.
---
What time does it start?
---
Dirge
---
Wow.  I just don’t get it... i mean leveling to 70 was easy and the T2 gear would’ve been obsolete fairly quickly.
---
Maybe that’s your opinion, but mine is ‘as long as you aren’t jerking off in a corner, you’re good’
---
LMFAO
---
You will have one this August!
---
alliance on dethecus called it VC and you would get flamed if you said LFG DM
---
Hey Cauthon Luck, I’m aware of the Wheel of Time character, but out of curiously are you the same CauthonLuck as the starcraft 2 player at MLGs back in the day? (Used a super fast banshee rush to take out Idra I think?)
---
If there was only one context in the game in which to view a spec, yes.
---
I played horde in og vanilla and am rolling a paladin in wow classic.....so I guess its just battle for azeroth
---
Had a good laugh. :D
---
Take this liiiiiifeee
---
Artem!!! You playing classic bro?!
---
Thats why in vanilla you would build a rep with others. If you did well or were son ungodly dps or cc  machine then people knew it.
---
Have you tried setting the Hz through the config.wtf file on private servers? Also while using Windowed mode? I've read this has worked for some people. However, I don't think private server clients were capable of going beyond 120Hz but I could be wrong.
---
How does one afford 40 wow subs?
---
1. PVP
---
2. PVE
---
3. Farming
---
You can pick one.
---
I love how a few people poked fun at you for this and you responded in a completely genuine and polite way each time. OP you seem like a nice guy, play how you want and have fun. I'll be lvling a rogue and look forward to the shenanigans that come with it.
---
Maybe I am misremembering, but I feel like I had seen several of them raiding at one point before the ban hammer hit them. I also want hybrid builds back, and one of the reasons I hated what became of WoW was the lack of diversity in classes. As more time went on the more all of the classes felt the same outside of a few specific differences.

Removing the skill tree for one was a huge mistake. Yes, there were cookie cutter builds, or the min-max builds, but you also had the option to branch out if you wanted. Which is how we ended up with that prot/holy build. I know at this point it would have gotten ridiculous with the balancing with 120 skill points, but they could have just tacked on those choices between 3 skills every x levels after hitting 80 rather than removing the trees entirely.
---
I never played WoW past vanilla and I always hear people talking about the "amazing" raid mechanics. Can you provide good examples of why raid mechanics are supposedly better?
---
I GOT BETA AS WELL ZOMG !
---
Pay for his first month. Sit his ass down one night and tell him the worst case scenario is spending a single day playing a game with a good friend. No pressure if he doesn't like it.
---
That's how I'd do it (if the funds aren't a problem). Maybe throw in some beer or whatever he likes to drink.
---
Any reason Disk 5 at the top?
---
Our guild, Epoch of Thought [H], PVP-NA, has a large number of veterans in it.  I'm the guild master and a retired USAF JAG.  I have structured the leadership with CoC and value military members.  We are running two raid teams, with the second team aiming to be raiding by the 60 day mark (2 months out).  That's about 20 hours of play a week with rested experience for leveling.  
---
Our first team is aiming to be raiding by the end of the 3rd week.  I hope to hear from you if you check out our ad and we seem to be a potential match.  If not I wish you all the best in your search, in game, and IRL.
---
Okay sure, 5 man dungeons (PVE). Not sure where you're going with this.

It's not a Classic logo. It's THE World of Warcraft logo with the word Classic underneath it.
---
I had forgotten that was even an option but thought it was pretty cool on the stress test.
---
It makes the raid management harder. 
---
First Reason: In my personal experience composition never matters if everything handy dandy. But once wiping begins (for whatever reason) human psychology looks to assign blame .... the "Viables" are the first to suffer = drama.
---
Second Reason: Where do we draw the line on "Viable". Is it Hybrid Tank/DPS? PVP specs for DPS? PVP spec for Tank and Healers? Melee hunter? Some LUL specs? Who is chosen to be in any spec they want? more drama.
---
As someone who spends at least 8 hours a day at a computer lemme tell you a few tips. I'm still looking for the magical cure to Carpal Tunnel, but these things at least help tremendously.
---
Arm stretches. Put your hands over your head all the way, rotate them, move them, bend your elbows in different positions. Put an arm straight in front of you, then push gently on your hand down and up slowly a few times. Like imagine your arm is like this: ___
---
Do this: __| and also downwards, the last line is your hand. Just dont hurt yourself.
---
Get little bean bag hand wrist rests for both arms. Rest your wrist on the wrist rest while you play. This helps your hand stay in a straighter line while playing with the mouse and keyboard. If you have a super skinny keyboard just use a rag or something. If it's a laptop well I dont have much advice there, just get your arms as straight as possible.
---
Carpal Tunnel getting noticable? Hot water. Like, ALMOST painful hot water, just dont hurt yourself. Get your wrists (and inner-elbows if it's bad) nice and warm, then of course dry yourself off if need be. Spend a bit of time doing that, doesn't take long. Longest part is waiting for my gosh dang water to heat up.
---
I'm really bad at remembering to keep a good posture, please do a better job than me.
---
And of course, rest. When you sleep, keep both arms STRAIGHT. S T R A I G H T. I stress this one because its important. I sleep on my side, so I sleep hugging a pillow in a way that lets one arm rest straight behind it and one arm rest straight on top of it.
---
If anyone else has Carpal Tunnel tips please lemme know
---
What Diablo 2 did you play where, work very few exceptions, blues were more desirable than yellows?
---
The Prodigy - Voodoo people
---
Best BG out there.
---
And I feel there are better ways to get that effect. For one I'd place the chest-unlocking npcs in the zones themselves instead of in the capital cities. Content designed to get people out into the world shouldn't drag them back to the city.
---
If you want something that *really* adds risk replace the chests with a currency that can be used to buy specific items. You want something that costs 5 units of currency? You'll have to have those 5 units in your inventory all at the same time. The risk required is directly tied to the cost of the thing you're buying. Want something that costs 1? No risk at all. Just get your unit and get back. Want something that costs 20? That's going to take some time and be especially risky. It'd probably be better to pvp your way to the goal, which puts more risk on everyone else.
---
That's one of the many beauties of Vanilla. No class is balanced properly, it's up to you to make something of your class. Every class has its function, yes. But left unchecked you can absolutely destroy anything, with any class. As a mage I'll have hard time against classes that can sustain themselves longer than I can, but it's not impossible.
---
Only class I would envy is unfortunately Paladin. Just because blessings are OP. Yes auto attack andy's are simply needed for blessings and if not for priests having fearward, they would make up for 1/4th of the raiding roster.
---
Luckily I'll play horde and as a caster, I just need a mana spring totem sometimes &amp; I'm good =)
---
Screw kings, salvation, freedom. We manage just fine without.

---
That's where the paladin is inverted. They can temporarily drop threat and stacks by using bubble. A skilled prot paladin can do it between swings so the target only changes target for a split second before resuming attacks on the paladin. Similarly, if the paladin is #2 in threat, they can force a switch by using BoP on the #1, but you still have to manage threat generation from that point to avoid a forced switch. 
---
Taunt makes all of this significantly easier, but there are ways to accomplish it.
---
Would take them days tho hahaha
---
Just another saltyboi who can't handle that people are better at the game than him.
---
Ah back then, coming back from school, double clicking the icon.
---
Pretty similar, but I was raised sceptical, so we'd really fight about whether there REALLY hadn't been any better games in the past 13 years. 
---
Then 16 y/o me would get depressed that not only there hadn't been, but my life had not progressed more than the games industry had in that time. 
---
Still no gf, no children, no full time job, honestly I think 16 y/o me would move out and take me as an example of what not to end up as.
---
So no duo-levelling for me unfortunately :(.
---
While we've got a warrior discussion going on would any experienced warriors be able to give me some insight? I'm looking to be PvP focussed so that means Arms. I know fury has far better sustained damage but does anyone have an idea of how much? obviously there are hundreds of factors... i suppose what i'm asking is would i be competitive or at least "viable" as arms DPS in PVE content or would i get laughed out the door with the Retadins (sorry bois)?
---
Not only that but Cat DPS does not care about the weapon damage. So 50 AGI on am UBER epic weapon or on a chest piece does the same thing. 
---
For Weapon wielding folks like Warrior and Rogue the actual damage spread on the weapon will directly affect the actual damage their abilities do. Same goes for hunter range weapon.
---
Okay.
---
People pay $75 for cable tv
---
...gross
---
the pack is 50 ppl trying to kill 10 boars...
---
i think the conventional wisdom of horde pvp  alliance pve and the undoubted usefulness of horde racials that has been regurgitated endlessly on private server forums will also have an impact. if everyone says horde are better in pvp, you see most influencers roll horde for pvp.... its not gonna pretty for alliance toons in STV come retail
---
 i can see a big population imbalance if things arent changed down the line.
---
I got stress test but no Beta lol :'(
---
Yes they are much kinder and gentler people, which is why most people play on PvP servers. They enjoy the dual faction aspect of the game. Not killing the same AI instances and raids for the 4,000th time 2 button healing. To each their own.
---
Something I learned after my first character transfer was to make a character on the target realm my the transfer character's name, if it wasn't already taken.  Free name change that would have otherwise cost money.
---
/r/HydroHomies
---
I am not sure I agree. A DPS warrior with a proper epic weapon will do much higher damage than with a poorly itemized blue. Hit rating comes to mind.
---
Tranq shot.
---
Lol, it's just an update to the launcher to prepare for release.
---
I don’t think you realize how much backend shit that private servers straight up pulled out of their ass. Mob ability usage, drop rates, patrol paths, spawn locations, respawn times, attribute values, etc. Not to mention all of the clientside exploits that would have to be repatched if they didn’t reverse engineer a legion client. As a software engineer, allow me to correct you: no one should be scratching their head on their choice of approach.
---
Have you been to /r/wow? There are so many people that absolutely hate Blizzard is spending one dollar of development resources on Classic and for every one of them, there's ten more that just laugh and say Classic will be a failure.
---
I hate to break it to ya, but BFA has a better ratio of non-raid-to-raid content that vanilla does.
---
The biggest problems with modern WoW is actually just the reward structure. There is little point to try to go above and beyond, because that is no longer needed. 
---
You don't need to work for rewards, just pull the slot machine enough times. Even if you wanted to work towards rewards, in BFA (and previous expansions to different extents) you can't. The best best you can do is pull the lever more.
---
This is why split raiding exists. To pull the lever more.
---
This is why why titan-forging exists. To pull the lever more.
---
This is why PvP Vendors were removed. To pull the lever more.
---
This is why Badge Vendors were removed. To pull the lever more.
---
This is why the end of Dungeon M+ chest functions the way it does. To pull the lever more.
---
The big **BIG** thing about classic, is that it's from before the lever existed in the current state.
---
Yes bosses drop loot at random, but the loot isn't randomized itself. 
---
For example, it will be random **if** [Smite's Mighty Hammer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7230/smites-mighty-hammer) drops from Mr. Smite in Deadmines. But, there is only one version of it. There is no higher ilvl or added socket, or tertiary stat possibilities. So when it drops, thats it. There is no more pulling the lever.
---
The other large difference is that the difficulty in classic is in preparation instead of execution. The dungeons and raids both are much easier than modern wow at a mechanical level. However the preparation needed is much more difficult. Between [attunements](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-attunements-and-keys-dungeons-raids) and the managerial difficulties of actually fielding a 40man roster. Compared to modern wow where you ... just log in and only need 19 other people, or significantly less if you aren't raiding mythic.
---
Don't pass off vanilla as "not about raiding". It was, it was very much about raiding. However the barrier to entry was much more difficult and many people just couldn't meet it.
---
The end goal was the same, Killing Raid Bosses. But the journey to get there in classic was much longer and more difficult. Which is why it is much more vivid in the memories of those who played it. In addition, by virtue of the journey being longer and more difficult, it was also a more important part of the game, even if it wasn't the end goal.
---
Helped someone to find her a few weeks ago and took him to the tent where she lies, and he then said "She sure looks a bit beaten up, guess he didn't like her cooking that much." which got a little chuckle out of me. At this point i knew i'm absolutly going to play Classic and enjoy the social aspects of it.
---
If you went the ultimate Raiding experience, play retail. If you want to go on a journey with the bois and have fun, play classic.
---
Not really, no. 
---
This was a test fitting :)
---
I would love ladder resets! That's the only reason why i played diablo 2 for 10+ years, i used to hate leveling in WoW but now it's the most fun part for me, especially when I'm competing with someone. Every reset you become more efficient
---
The trick is to have 100 million gold on retail from years of being a goblin. TBH I probably would still pay for it with cash if I had to. It’s not that expensive for me and I deeply enjoy turning wow into an RTS.
---
I plan on it, but I know when the time comes I won't.
---
Fair enough the EU players can’t get in so they’re wrong there. But they stated it’s available to all players of wow (aside from the EU part) how can you be a player without a sub?
---
yeah i dislike classic pvp a lot. to be honest you seem like the kind of the type of person i want to avoid playing with. kinda toxic i think.
---
I’m right heeerrree
---
The salty tears over there are hilarious
---
i dont think u know what refresh rate is vs  frames per second :X yikes
---
at most ur thinking of verticle sync, which is a big nono
---
Yep. He played Warcraft 3 and Smash Bros Melee at a high level as well.
---
ITT: OP has no idea who North is
---
Or..........
---
It's to build hype and get people excited? If they invited a lot of people then people would already get burnt out and clearing content way faster on release.
---
And if he doesn't like it look into multiboxing so you get some worth out of paying for his month.
---
I'd tell my old self to stop being a clicking/keyboard turning retard and git gud.
---
Might be an idea, id be surprised if that worked, i uninstalled my private servers though ):
---
Yea, and half of us won't need to face a corner to avoid FPS drops from spell animations...lol
---
Roll mage = profit ??
---
/trade Selling food/water 1g a stack. Portals to OG/TB/UC 2g a pop. UBRS  key service 10g
---
10-50g an hour for "afk" watching netflix/porn = not bad :)
---
thats odd, it should have it under either refresh rate Hz option or resolution in video game options?
---
My private server experiences, we had a feral Druid who tanked/off tanked most bosses from when we started in BWL through to clearing naxx. Fights with fear mechanics or dispels, he’d often switch to resto gear and heal/decurse. 
---
In a guild that isn’t 100% min/maxing, having 1 feral tank along with a few warriors is very viable.
---
Im interested in doing this but i dont have any sort of BiS list compiled.
---
Yeah, can't wait to see them faces. Along with rogues expecting TF.. Not to mention dkps or loot priority. Good ol days - for me.
---
it's going to be so fucking easy. this is actually my biggest concern about the game. yeah the average modern wow player is still bad, but they're exponentially better than the average 2005 wow player.
---
Ok man, why don't you make another post asking again?
---
And the majority of the game for most players isn't raiding.
---
To your point, of course it's up to the raid leader / guild leader how they want to run things and what is required. Feel free to gkick anyone who is missing a single consumable or talent point, that's fine. It's just not how most people will play the game.
---
My post was not at all about demanding that guilds bring wand dps priests to raids and if you thought it was I question your ability to lead a raid in the first place. There are people who legit think an enhance shaman in the tank group totem twisting and applying nightfall isn't viable at all. Those are the people I'm mocking here.
---
Is shadow pvp rly that gud or is this just a takeoff. You can also see pvp videos pf rogue who lock kill others or warlocks winning 1v2. So it the class or just an optimal gear vs player situation?
---
Am I being whooshed? I can't speak to alliance side, but deadmines was VC for horde on the servers I played on in vanilla.
---
God’s we where strong then!
---
Let's not forget the point that many are willfully avoiding thinking about the game in order to (a) be able to experience the game whole-heartedly when they themselves actually get to play through it, instead of getting cucked by streamers playing their cherished memories for them while getting paid in milf-bux for cringe content and (b) avoid going insane since the game won't be out for months yet. Personally, after tomorrow's open beta, I'll have had my fix and will be putting classic as out of my mind as I can. Either that, or I will be freezing myself in the snow until my friend can thaw me on release day.
---
I played from day 1 in Vanilla on Dunemaul, a European server.
---
I was in my estimation in one of the top 5 guilds as a druid healer, the seccond best in my guild. 
---
(Played healing spec from level 1-60 cause no one knew better haha but it made me an awesome healer).
---
My proudest moments did not come from a raid. It came from playing my class and spec well. 
---
I could solo heal Upper Black Rock Spire, a dungeon with a group of 15 people. 
---
THAT is my proudest moment because it was much harder than raiding and way less aggravating and time consuming. You'll see what I mean with that later. 
---
I could also turn the battle around in AV and be a huge part in us winning those long fights, because of my heals. WSG was a breeze as a flag carrier also and so much fun! 
---
Ok to the point about raiding. I know in retail, the end game is all there is. But in vanilla for about two years(!) NO ONE in our entire server did Naxxramas. Imagine that. 
---
I took a break after about two years because of life, and joined again when TBC came out but even then to my recollection I never saw anyone with full tier 3 raid sets. 
---
During my two years of playing I only remember seeing ONE druid with full Tier 2(!) Raid set on our server and despite our guild being top 5.
---
My guild did kill Ragnaros, Onyxia and started BWL.
---
MC was 2 times per week. 
---
For those precious few runs that could span 5-6 hours easily, I was second pick as healing druid because the other druid played more than me and therefore would get all druid drops he needed first. 
---
Here was the aggravating part.
---
I had to kindly sit and wait and see ANOTHER druid get all my (very rare dropped) gear because he had done more guild events than me. Imagine that. 
---
Your guild does Molten Core 2 times per week. 
---
It requires you to skip family dinner because it would take all evening after school to join, you had to sign up a week ahead to promise you would be there. Every kill has a very low chance to drop something for your class, and when it does, you will not get it because another druid played more than you and so is prioritized.
---
So you have to join, knowing you will not get any gear, just to participate enough to get the gear a few weeks down the road when the other druid has it already. 
---
In short, I realized raiding wasn't worth it for me and I did PvP instead.
---
My plan for classic is getting dungeon set 1 for a Warlock, Mage, Druid and Rogue and max out some professions. That is enough to take about 1.5 years of playing about 2-3 hours a day. That will be enough for me this time around.
---
Lol, you’re an animal armchair quarterback. 
---
1. Would you suggest he tab target to re-apply poly to one target in a room of almost 10 targets?
---
2. Do you know how strafing is currently working in the beta? Watch the clip again. His cone of cold animation goes to the right because he is strafing right, but the damage goes out forwards, and you can see ~350ish damage splashes on all targets in front of him.
---
It might would be if there was another instance that shared the same abbreviation.
---
I only just realised today after checking out the 8.2 thread... any mention of classic wow gets downvoted.
---
yeah? the legit all-time stupidest thing?
---
I raised with 10 FPS, it was glorious.
---
Nice, I only have an anonymous FB though, maybe ill pop in.
---
That's sick you have all your old stuff, too. I know the Mcfizz vid is listed under our WF kill here:https://www.method.gg/raid-history but if you have any other good ones you should upload em :D
---
World buffs were great to grief tho with that mechanic, a simple taunt and turn the wrong way was all it took sometimes, hahaha.
---
At this point I'm convinced that people calling Deadmines DM are just private server folk or Europeans who just pretend to have played vanilla back then.
---
It's VC, as stupid as that may be.
---
because that would be silly lol, dont be so silly bro
---
do you know what time its going live?
---
Yes you absolutely can.  That’s what made classic so good.  Hunters/warlocks needed to help each other, rogue and Druid got to solo missions ins health or with others in stealth,  warriors paladins had to rely on others to help them get somewhere.   The game was built to be played as a team to accomplish goals.  
---
The problems began to happen when end game wasn’t developed for random classes to take specific roles.  To beat the bosses you needed a specific group. That’s when people began to make new characters (which on its own was fun), but eventually became a grind. A lot of negativity was thrown around to people who wouldn’t allow others in a 40 man raid to join because some of the asshats has to level up their alt.  
---
It’s more complicated than that, but the real troubles with WOW began when they were not ready with their raid system.
---
Thats exactly what happened with my as well except i had a 54 druid and my mate was leveling a rogue
---
Why do you think that layering is a client-side feature? LOL. Definitely not.
---
Buy a Macbook Pro and return it within 2 weeks.
---
Do you realize that there is a 0% chance that a feature such as layering is implemented client-side? Layering == implemented server-side
---
Buy an MMO mouse with 12 buttons.

Sounds like the naxx poison boss

We already knew this. Landro Longshot wasn't added to the game until the TBC pre-patch.

And yet I see people speculating about TCG items every other day.

What classes ranked 1 to 8 have the highest dps?

Yw
---
There's also people that think Blizzard is ever going to spend a single dollar developing new content for Classic. Idiots all around.
---
Thats my goal.full tier 0.5
---
Knowing what gear to get, being the only one allowed the gear, and your group having perfection in the raid fights is so much more than classic wow players had.
---
raiding in retail sux.  loot pinata bullshit
---
tbc classic is what we need
---
No,  Thottbot for me.

About damn time. One of the reasons I quit is because back in burning crusade I had friends and we worked together. During mists I felt alone all the time so I stoped playing.

 **Vanilla WoW is not about raiding** 
---
Vanilla WoW is about what you want to get out of it.  What bugs me, is when people make posts about what WoW Classic is or is not about.  That maybe raiding, that maybe RP in Goldshire, it maybe ganking people in STV.
---
Yes. That's why many people want it.
---
So many players commenting about a thread about classic wow and they being in expansions that are so far removed from the original content.    Meh!
---
US but hello brother!
---
Thank you. I've been eyeing a t480s with no dedicated GPU. Good to know integrated i5-8350U will run smoothly. Do you have specific FPS?
---
Back in Vanilla, a lot of high end guilds stopped trying hard (or at all) on Naxx because TBC was around the corner, so the solution was to "borrow" geared warriors from other guilds. 
---
In the pserver era, there are strats that don't require 8 geared warriors.
---
Oh damn, passive aggressive is unhealthy for everyone bro.
---
Not really? Off the top of my head I can only think of this and Doin Time. What am I missing?
---
Agreed. Point stands, this is the first time I've seen a blue post talking about how there will be no way of redeeming TCG items, and I browse this sub every day. I'm just conveying information we all knew was likely to happen, but now have "official" word on.
---
Classic only unless blizz makes some drastic changes to current retail.
---
That's funny, I always thought it was Bob Marley but I guess he covered it too?

Work, classic wow, repeat. This is going to be my life for awhile lol
---
The fact sixteen year old me is sleeping on the floor.
---
Agreed. The majority of the game is not raiding but specs only matter when you play as a part of a team usually in a raid less so in PVP. So it was implied that any wacky spec is "Viable" as long as you are not expecting to be in a raid as per my previous points. 
---
I am not sure what nightfall is but I assume it is a weapon debuff, I am familiar with totem twisting and now you are shifting gears into min/maxing so "bleeding edge of competitive raiding". Technically what you are suggesting is not Viable but actually Optimal. 
---
An amazing any spec will crush an average raid spec. We are talking about you totem twisting out of your mind while a couple of feral druids dont even know what powershifting is. BUT WE HAVE A HYBRID. more drama. 
---
By definition Optimal means the best in the current situation. Viable means simply usable. 
---
Coming back to my point, In group play most of the folks dont want to be locked into the raid spec. A lot of ppl like to flash the gear in the PVP or simply be able to farm. So everyone will want to be in their preferred spec.  
---
I am all for fun specs but context is important.
---
One thing retail got right, troll druids.
---
I was going to yell at you, but honestly yours looks a lot better. Since perfection is lots of little things done right, fixing this goes a long way. Not to mention the fix is piss-easy.
---
Fucking amen brother thank you! You put this more eloquently than I have in the past and I end up bashing min maxing when all I’m really trying to say is play the game! Stop trying to look up guides and be fully optimized when you’re not in the top 1% of playerbase just because your favorite streamers are going hard. You’re not them so don’t be a sheep, make your own choices and just experience the awesome game for what it is.
---
I'm also trying to figure that out.
---
Priest. Definitely druid.
---
Um are you new here? It’ll be a grind
---
I'll play mostly Classic but I'll probably dabble in current just to play with my guild members who wont be partaking in Classic too much.

On the Mac I can run the vanilla 1.12 Windows client through wineskin on private servers, using very high settings, and it's working great.
---
Do you think that will continue to work for classic?
---
Haha cheers man!
---
Stance dance

Fishing bot on a second machine that I can respond to whenever required. You can make 750g an hour just vendoring level 110 fish. At 40 hours a week, that's enough to always pay for your subscription. =P
---
I would rather watch paint dry than play retail wow.
---
I'll play both.
---
Cuz u actually need the extra healing or stamina or whatever dps increase. Not everyone will be equally geared. And this time its gonna be noticeable. Just have a look at the stat / performance differences with and without consumables. I mean, for example, the titan flask is 1200 hp or so.. How much stamina equalls to that on a warrior? Or popping a major hp / mana pot.
---
U r right, it should be easier theoretically. We will see, I am excited even about grinding the consumables.
---
Blizzard said the game is using 1.12 data. TCG card redemption was never in 1.12.
---
That's all the official confirmation you really needed.
---
It’s one of the main reasons why I want to see Classic+ eventually. I want raids to still be a major component of the game, but I want them to develop other interesting content for end game eventually.
---
Considering that I'm going to start my subscription on the 1st I wager I'm going to poke around a little bit in Retail. 
---
But I won't buy BoA and will probably never buy another expansion to be honest.

Yeah that’s what I told him, he can always drop it if it’s not his thing. I’ll offer to pay for the first month, good idea
---
Kinda wish there weren't class restrictions on raid sets. The rogue dungeon set is great for feral druids.
---
Where can I get that?
---
I think they should name the realms after the old gods and other ancient creatures.
---
Classic = old wow -&gt; servers should have old names
---
Dont put in flames with that fucking garbage in the op.
---
Ishnu Dal Dieb
---
Whether or not you think it would cause confusion, Blizzard has already stated that they will not reuse current server names for Classic servers.
---
Wow classic can’t destroy your social life if you don’t have a social life.
---
I tested this a while back in a video I made for YouTube, but, my impressions are that Classic will run a little better than Vanilla does if you're using a modern (last 6-7 years) PC. Your MacBook Pro should be absolutely fine for Classic, maybe needing to turn down a few graphical settings if you're in a larger group or raid. But, overall, you should be more than set on the MBP2018.
---
Check the elitist jerks forums from 2005.
---
Can you say that in Latin please
---
You spelled DM wrong.
---
Wanderlei Silva would be proud of this.
---
Yes the constant moving is similar to grobulus but thays about it. The debuff in this fight in legion didnt drop floor lava it was a beacon for him to charge to and it split damage and put a debuff on people between points. I also left out the constant tank swap needed but I never main tanked a raid so I forgot about it. Grobulus had the advantage that ranged basically never really have to move much if you dont get the debuff, and there are a majority of vanilla bosses like that. 
---
I think my point stands though: in terms of mechanics vanilla is quite boring for raiding. You look at some of the mythic encounters like Cenarius or MOTHER or Gthuun there is just nothing close to that complexity. Mythic dungeon bosses are more complex sometimes. Raiding, especially until naxx is basically just a elementary competency test for todays gamers. The biggest vanilla raiding hurdle is going to be having 40 people show up on time and be able to have the mental capacity slightly above a brick.
---
Yup. And yet I still see people speculating about TCG items every other day. Having a blue post explicitly state that there won't be a way is (apparently) needed these days.
---
Like a wise man once said, "Idiots all around."
---
Or the elemental mage who jumps in, nova, blast wave, coc and yells for the horse before before a 180 blink. Or get insta spell locked / silenced.
---
That's gonna be me.
---
Make sure to reduce the energy consumption of the 2nd as much as possible.
---
Regularly running you'll may as much for the electricty as you would have paid for the sub
---
Think I'll stick to ashes of the wake, watershed and 10,000 days. Worked well the first time.
---
Every class can raid yes, but 95% of guilds that do raid are not going to allow in a Ret/Ele/Enh/Boomy. Similarly some classes like hunter/druid have limited raid spots. So while people need not worry about being gods gift to PVE, picking a reasonably strong class/spec to ensure you will see the raid content if you want to is in no way elitist.
---
They won't be able to hide it. I give it 15 minutes before they're sussed out
---
in vanilla, 31/20 (arms/fury, mortal strike and enrage) warrior is the only way to go in PvP. sure you could be prot and maybe run the flag or something if the druid doesn't feel like doing it but mortal strike was amazing in PvP. only class who had the healing debuff. 
---
fury warriors with a lot of hit were better as PvE dps, though. getting enough +hit can be a bit of a pain in all blues.
---
Awesome, thanks, I'll try to find the video you mentioned as well.
---
Current? Retail? What’s that?
---
I miss the plague lands. I can't wait to do strat runs again and fight over those damn towers.
---
Blizzard would have done this for you for free
---
Trolls should be opposite of Gnomes I think. They are both races without a capital city, indepted to their closest ally. Other than that it looks great!
---
A lot of this is probably because they don't know how to make tanking less specialized. See e.g. [Why threat should matter](http://pastebin.com/rnTU4dXh).
---
Threat can let a game's designers do lots of neat stuff. Want to make hybrid tanks? Make the boss "randomly" (i.e., players have some control but not full control) attack other targets, and the best tank has to fight for a while to get aggro back. You can do things like make bosses "auto-cleave" with damage split between adjacent targets (but total damage increased so you ideally still have one player tanking in usual cases) so squishy classes get rewarded for taking survival talents without making the boss hit so weak that the fight isn't challenging. That is, if you get one-shot there's no benefit to a talent or piece of gear that reduces damage taken by 2% at the cost of 1% damage dealt.
---
Want to make hybrid healers spend some time healing, instead of dpsing all the time, even if they're just healing themselves? (Seems pretty obvious to heal yourself if you're almost dead, but with specialization it's mathematically a bad choice.) Make it so healers have a risk of pulling aggro from healing, and let players heal in ways that reduce total risk to the group or increase total effectiveness. Example, mechanics are such that if a rogue stops dpsing to bandage themselves, the threat distribution of the group is better than if a healer had done it (and the healer saves mana). 
---
You still have the problem that a game with just specialization faces, of possibly having to have enrage timers (which are lame) on bosses for them to be challenging if players bring extra healers. Even if you have something like "healing fatigue" that reduces effectiveness of heals received after a while, more healers, whether specialized or hybrid, is usually still better without an enrage timer.

nah diremaul will be in phase1
---
fury warrior does fine in raids. i'd put you in a group with rogues and a shaman so you can be a buff bot and also do good dps. unless they changed it for classic, in vanilla, buffs like battle shout, WF totem were only applied to your 5 man group within the raid.

You’ve uh, got a long wait there, buddy. 
---
*logs back into the beta server*
---
Preach my man, you couldn’t be more right! I think the problem with the BiS lists is people are seeing streamers with their BiS toons on the beta at lvl 30 and 40 and thinking it’s easy...not realizing that farming lvl 30 dungeons and having your viewers hand you crafting mats for all your BiS gear is a totally different ball game than lvl 60 BiS with raid drops that take months for you to get. Unfortunately lots of sheep just follow the streamers but they are the ones who will tap out before even reaching 60.
---
It's my Plex server, so it's always running anyway. Besides, all my utilities besides internet are included in the condo's rental price.
---
i pretend i'm a drug dealer handing out first time free crack.  I know they'll be back for more hehehe
---
mom is paying 4 the electricity so it doesn't matter
---
Classic only. Retail would need to do a ton to get me back once classic is out. Things they'd never do. Plus my retail guild is mostly avoiding classic. No use trying to juggle relationships with 2 guilds. Go all in with classic, form some real bonds.
---

Found mine, this is great!
---
He was just frustrating I think. He has a level 40 character in classic, he feels like explored just as much as he wants to explore in classic.
---
But he was still feeling the itch and wanted to play retail and see how that was. The whole chat was just ragging on retail (probably parroting Asmongold) like it is incomprehensible that anyone would want to or like playing retail.
---
Was another lame instance of Twitch chat parroting a popular streamer.
---
Do you think the R3 2200G can run Classic on high? 
---
I'm so out of the loop with the WoW graphics settings having been gone so long. I used to max out vanilla with a Pentium D and an nVidia 7900 GS but I have no idea what that translates to modern-day (especially with the WoW engine upgrades).
---
Yeah I was watching a MC run on YouTube last night and the group while not really geared at all except the tank had absolutely no problems for the first half of the raid that I watched. Basically a giant dungeon
---
yea but that crystal water was the best shit.  Had to go to diremaul for it but worth it
---
I get that you don't want to "carry" people, but your attitude towards this issue is unnecessary. The casuals will find their social groups/ guilds and the hardcore players will find theirs. 
---
Myself, I'm sort of "casual-core" lol. I enjoy chasing bis items, being in the most effective spec, doing as much dps as I can. That said, I like playing with people I enjoy spending time with, and that sometimes means I end up carrying them to an extent, and I don't mind at all. 
---
It also means I get to teach them things about the game sometimes. I enjoy that too! I'm rambling a bit, but I guess my point is, don't worry about it. You do your thing, and if you don't like the way someone else is doing their thing, don't play with them.
---
Hah! That’s wicked!! I never followed the Melee scene (though I watched the documentary and read the odd update on Hungrybox), and probably will get into the WC3 scene when reforged releases.
---
I loved those old SC2 tournies when the game was young and nobody knew what the heck they were doing.
---
some of those are very viable. prot pally, elemental shaman, feral tank, boomkin are decent in good hands. they get better with better gear. the tank roles can fit in certain niches.
---
There is no rp-pvpv in this list. QQ. Can you guys flood rp server so Blizz will be forced to add rp-pvp? :D
---
In my experience every min max guild I raided mythic with on current xpacs had like 20% of players that were super toxic to where progressing in the top percent of players wasn’t even fun
---
Who cares if your guild clears a raid 3 lockouts later because you’re playing with people you like and a spec you enjoy
---
Interesting. Thanks!

I already sent my son out to get a long weight.  Next will be the left handed screwdriver and the check paint.

you dont

i think racials should be removed from the game, some matchups are just so one sided as a result.

pretty sure spirit didn't work in combat in vanilla. nobody would pick spirit over mp5. mp5 worked through combat and was always desired. but good use of rank 1 heals can offset most things.
---
Only if you've got a lackluster gm.
---
The fighter shouldn't be in full plate all the time. Shit gets heavy and people look at you funny.
---
A gm should reward the fighter for occasionally going in medium armor.
---
Or, if the group has a rogue, take a medium armor tank.
---
Less mountain dew MW2 montage, and more just regular gameplay as if I were watching a stream.
---
I don't think that I could have handled raids. I know that I couldn't handle Ironforge.
---
Every class can raid.
---
I have an active subscription and can only see the live game and PTR (I have never been in any classic beta/stress test)
---
Didnt they already say they wernt launching rp-pvp?
---
Main classic, but arena cap on retail every week
---
Amen to that. The elitism and min maxing is cancer. Leveling up and enjoying the quests and zones is the part of classic I’m looking forward to the most. I loved leveling up my warrior back in 2005/6 and I miss that feeling, felt like you were part of the story.
---
Not really, Most of the starting areas are pretty even when it comes to the number of quests and density. There are some that are a bit quicker but not enough to really effect the time.
---
Caster classes were a little bit slower due to drinking for mana but non caster classes have to stop to eat sometimes so they are pretty even. Rogues tend to be a bit quicker due to them not needing to stop nearly as much.
---
yep healthstones to tank, soulstone to healer
---
yes, pvp is life or death so anything goes. Dueling should be about who is better at their class though, not who has the better consumables
---
Warriors baseline aren't actually very good vs a lot of classes. If you start abusing a lot of consumables and items they become way better, especially if you have good gear as well.
---
For example there are quite a few items that can make you immune to snares. There's a belt, a pair of boots, potions etc. So if you aren't try harding you get messed up really bad ya.
---
Vip mentality
---
They make it limited for a reason, and it's not because they think their main game will die. Rofl
---
People are trying way too hard to make retail out to be some kind of monster, simply don't play it, tons of people do and will continue, and guess what, a lot of them will enjoy classic and retail!
---
 Gasp
---
We understand what you're saying and, despite your concise opinions, still think different realm names is good idea
---
Clearly you struggle with context but I hope you feel better about being bad now?
---
i'm just coming back for classic. could never stick to wow during the few times i came back (legion and the one before) because it felt so watered down. actually having to CC and worry about threat made the game so much fun for me. PUGs were actually good cus you had to make friends and learn how to play if you wanted to get grouped consistently.
---
Geez, just have fun. Your plan sounds like a chore. I'm rolling priest. Plan done.
---
Make sure your Battle.Net app is completely updated (you'll see a restart link at the bottom if it's not).
---
After that, you should see a dropdown for choosing "World of Warcraft Classic". This will allow you to download and launch the game.
---
Assuming the account you're using is active with game time, tomorrow at 5PM EDT, you'll be able to login and play for 48 hours.
---
Yup I didn’t go to neckbeard level. Clearly my post was in the context of raid gear vs epics but it’s cool. I hope you feel good bro. You deserve it! Fuck context. Your rose colored glasses fix all the pain.
---
healthstones
---
Honestly, I think the minmax mindset is far too pervasive at this point. I think what you're advocating is great and I agree with it completely. Unfortunately, raid/dungeon groups are going to choose classes over the player 80% of the time unless the group already knows the player. 
---
The start of BFA has proven that. For example, elemental shamans and shadow priests had a hell of a time trying to find PUGs (I main spriest myself and can vouch).  Even though spriest was actually really for dungeons the reputation had ruined them for pugging. There simply is no way that mindset won't carry over into classic.
---
Ultimately, I think that for many it's less about topping meters and more about being able to get groups. Why spends 200 hours when the next 150 are going to be a pain in the ass? People ask whats best because they don't want to drop a bunch of time into a character only to find out they could have invested it more wisely.
---
No this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w

---
If you’re sl it won’t even matter. You take 30% less damage, you can sac in a stun, have improved healthstone, out of stun you can coil dot shadowburn fel dom summon another voidwalker, refresh dots or if you’re feeling good fear to bait out the wotf then you’ve got your improved healthstone if you get low plus you have your 2nd sac that you can cast fear in and you know they don’t have wotf. 
---
It’s really not that big of a deal just something you have to play around and use your noggin to know how to deal with it.
---
You must mlr be very bright then
---
If you are ahead of the pack doesnt that by defintion mean your doing well?
---
Chicken Nugget
---
Personally, I hope the classic server names are the same names they were in classic. There are a lot of friends I had back then that I lost contact with and I'm hoping that if I role the same server I might meet some people I haven't talked to in nearly 12 years..
---
That crossbow from bwl
---
Yeah i dont get the logic here
---
theres a open stress test starting at 2 pm PST anyone can join if u have an active sub, max level is 15. i know its 7am for me in australia, tommorow.
---
warriors could 1v1 just fine against most classes. the ones i had trouble with were holy/prot pallies and classes who could kite me easily like hunters, druids or really good rogues. mages or warlocks who go the drop on you open world could wreck you too. the norm back then was to get 60, have 31/20 ms/enrage, have a minimum of 5k life,  craft an arcanite reaper, profit. maybe get the unstoppable force too (if they're gonna have it in classic release).
---
Obviously.  Every spec though?   
---
They *can*, but is every spec going to be good?
---
Leeroy
---
Is that in total or just for one region? Either way, that can't be right, it's way too few for launch.
---
This isn’t that kind of video though! This is my take on an oldschool style pvp video
---
&gt; This obsession over playing at the top 1% of all players is absolute nonsense in Classic. 
---
blizz instilled this mindset until wrath and then LFR.
---
Shadow is really good and I’m also a good player, so if you put those together you get a lot of wins against uncoordinated players in general PvP
---
&gt; Main tank is taking a dump, so you sit around doing nothing for 15 minutes great!
---
nobody cares when the rogue bios
---
All very interesting. They ended up adding it in the very next expansion though. His philosophy behind rets sound cool, but it didn't really play out that way. Ret paladins don't "react" with blessings, the only thing they "react" with is bubbles, other than that they spam Judgement off cooldown and.. nothing else. Ret needed another ability, and CS was that ability. I fucking hated leveling a ret due to how there simply was nothing to do other than hope for SoC procs.
---
nice. i only learned about this today. i relogged into WOW for the 1 month free with my gold. thanks for letting us know how to get it. didn't realize i could select it.
---
I dont understand why they removed this, its not even bad
---
Yes it is, as 4 days 20 is less than 6 days.  That's the meaning of the phrase.    In practice it's not likely, but if we would award €1,000,000 to someone who could do it,  someone would find a way.  (With a lot of training)
---
Yea crazy how they added lots of servers the day before millions try to log on.
---
I remember trying to get through ironforge took hours because my computer just couldn’t handle the amount of people there lmao. I completely agree with everything you said man
---
Looks like they are gone, or I can't seem to find them, do you have a link?
---
Nope.
---
&gt;How disappointed would a player making a paladin in Classic be when he finds out he's actually one of the worst tanks in the game and has to work 2x as hard as the other two?
---
Hopefully not too bad once he remembers he can heal, too.
---
Judgement of wisdom is good for when some DPS Go oom
---
&gt; ost expacs ive played 30+ days in game at max and i feel im fairly casual.
---
did you see all the content?
---
Not ridiculous, it happens if you assume one lives in City A and they live in City B. Its easy to be confused when things are similar which i think its safe to say BFA and Classic is/will be
---
I couch gamed for 6 or 7 years. Bought a lay-z-boy and have never looked back. About a year ago I added a wall mounted monitor arm to make positioning monitors easier. This setup is almost perfect. I'd like to build some custom shelving around for "desk" space. That's all I feel this lacks.

Asmongold
---
Tirisfal is going to be so bad. The bottle necks in that zone.
---
yes, weapons and u know, the rest of the gear
---
I also like that there are other sets with set bonuses that aren't class sets.  I also like that even while leveling up you could get armor with set bonuses.
---
It's for the NA only stress test
---
At first they said that Pr-PVP will be few weeks after launch if there is enough interest in it. Later i heard that they considering adding one...
---
the stress test isn't active until tomorrow
---
Then it ain't beta
---
The launcher shows beta for everyone, it's the launcher update getting ready for release and the fact there's a stress test coming
---
It is readily available but people dont look up shit. They just keep making new posts about the same stuff, like you are doing.
---
&gt; Edit : don't worry about the fact that my warrior won't generate as much rage with pw:s on.. It's only a multi mobs strategy
---
*ahem*
---
So I just got pranked and spent 12€ for nothing ?
---
I dont quite think you understood his post.
---
do you guys plan on healing/tanking in 5 mans? either way, the best spec i had for leveling my warriors was going DW fury early on and switching to arms (2h mortal strike) when i had 31 points. you could still tank fine. i never got a priest high level so i can't say how it was to heal 5 mans early game in shadow spec. i would think it should be ok given i used to do a lot of pugs with shadow spec guys.
---
Raiding in vanilla wasn't time-consuming at all. Everything is easily cleared in 2 days up until Naxxramas.
---
MC takes an hour max, quick half hour Onyxia. BWL might take 2 hours. ZG another hour. That's just 1 raid night. Other day is open for progress raids, such as AQ40 and Naxx ultimately.
---
Eventually you'll clear MC, BWL, AQ in 1 night and have the second day for doing Naxx. So dedicating 2 days to raiding, isn't alot &amp; most (if not all) guilds will have this kind of raiding roster, until Naxx atleast. 
---
Besides the consumable farm, it's going to be an easy casual experience, but the RPG elements wil remain and are the "main" content of the game. A massive world to explore, to just have fun &amp; cannibalize some Gnomes along the way. Perfect.
---
You can't compare 2019 to '04-'05 either. It's the same game, but 90% of the population will now min-max their character to the point it needs to have Engineering. The meta has shifted, still unsure if this will be good thing for the longevity of the game or not.
---
Eventhough  I haven't played WoW since basically Cata (weak moment during WOD doesn't count, 1 month of garrison farming, wauweee \^\^) , I know my class, faction, profs that I want, for years already. I'm not going to deviate(scale) from my plan. Yes I have put alot of time &amp; effort into this, but it's an RPG, which I fully tend to explore to it's fullest potential, meaning I will partake in RP events &amp; whatnot. I actually won a swift spectral tiger during a lvl 1 hide&amp;seek (player-made) event in Cataclysm.  How freaking cool is that?
---
Still, it's up to you to make yourself a legend &amp; instill fear into your enemies, when they just see your name :)
---
Ahhh ok. I dont see what the big deal is. Just throw rp infront if pvp. Really that simple
---
I only read the part About Where to go
---
You can enjoy the journey and still be mindful of your viability at 60. Just because people ask which class/race/spec combo is best for endgame raiding doesnt mean that particular combination is detrimental to their levelling experience.
---
Enjoying both aspects of the game are not mutually exclusive. For example I enjoy both.
---
Also surprised. Using a Threadripper 2950x and a Radeon VII. Easily got super high frames around 280 or so. But I only have a 1440 144hz so I locked it around there.
---
Nah. 
---
As they patch in more content it would obviously advance the game along. 
---
So I could see why others might expect this to be added later. 
---
Tbh I’m not exactly sure when all the loot cards were added.  I can see both sides to this tbh.
---
real 3 is the place 2 be. i'm hoping it's going to be packed enough for some action but not too packed that  you can't login.
---
So I spent 12€ for nothing ?
---
It happens in games all the time these days. There is so much information on the Internet and it is so easy to find that people default to looking up top builds and strategies, before they try anything themselves.
---
While back in the day I think in Classic you may hear about a top build or race/class combo but that was likely when you were in game talking to people, and it definitely wouldn't be your first toon.
---
*bubble hearths*
---
I don't really mind. I never even think about my server name. I just got there because the population is highest in my region and it's PVP. They server could be called anything really.

---
I mean, you spent it on a WoW subscription. You will be able to play the stress test for the next 2 days, but thinking you will get full Beta access just because you subscribed is naive.
---
I always play a new expansion for a couple months before realizing I don’t like it and quitting. So no. I’ve already quit bfa and wasn’t planing on returning until the next xpac to try.
---
If you spent it to get into beta, yea, but look on the bright side, you won't have to worry about getting mugged and someone taking that money from you
---
I subscribed because I thought I got the beta and not the other way around. I just thought the servers would get online if I take a subscription
---
GPU &amp; MOBK went bad? Or is that what the shop wants you to think? I would ask for proof before they bend you over.
---
People say Warlocks are overpowered, use Exorcism on the pet, BOOM, killed the pet.
---
Shaman!... Or Priest? Warrior!
---
people hate modern wow because of the changes that later expansions brought. i dont get why they are so ready to embrace TBC classic and beyond... it will lead back to the game you hated
---
Then I suppose it's your own fault for not reading readily available information. It has been known for almost a month that to get access to the Beta, you need an active subscription. And even then, the invites are very selective.
---
the new spelladin build certainly will
---
I usually make a bank alt a lvl 19 twink to have some fun on. when i get bored on my main.
---
I definitely did the whole thing in one go once
---
Yeah, I don’t think pop culture references in quest text caused the success of WoW
---
The controls in WoW are quite simply perfect. There’s no stupid acceleration or other gimmicks that get in the way. Controls decide how the game feels for the player and is the no. 1 priority in any video game - and Blizzard bailed it perfectly.
---
I tried playing LotRo and I quit instantly after moving my character for 10 seconds. It felt wrong.
---
1. There are macros
---
2. You can get many keys on your keyboard to work. You have your usual hotkeys, then you have shift+those hotkeys, then you have ctrl+those hotkeys.
---
Blood and Thunder mother fucker!
---
Everyone says that on forums. Still no answer from Blizz. We are making noise there and hope for best.
---
They're not patching in any new content.
---
And the loot cards became redeemable on Live servers on 5 December 2006 with the release of the 2.0.1 TBC pre-patch.
---
When it was initially implemented it wasn't bad and without cross realms it would be a more convenient way to form a group without as much impact on the social element. LFG does not make as much impact as other features implemented. For me what really killed the social impact was cross realm zones and perhaps raid finder. Looking for a group pre LFG was just spamming trade chat in a city which to me doesn't feel really social.
---
That run is a rite of passage everyone must do it at least once in their lives.
---
Nope, that's my life. I enjoy it. 8-9 hrs for work as a software dev. Either a jog or basketball on my lunch breaks a few days a week. Then sitting in my recliner gaming and watching TV/movies for another 6-8. Just have to get good setups that works for you.
---
Sounds like the Box from fortnite  xD
---
Devs have repeatedly stated the population was capped between 2.5k and 3k and that it was an intentional choice.
---
Gods I was strong then
---
I'm a bit disappointed that they don't have an RP-PvP but I'll be happy on Realm 3. 
---
Realm 3 for you and me.
---
were you 21when you first played vanilla?
---
Not the only way lol
---
Bang bang
---
I have played both on Classic and on Pservers. 
---
On Classic I get much better performance and you also get the luxury of locking FPS so you aren't roasting your GPU for no reason. 
---
Using a TR4 2950x and Radeon VII I was able to get well over 144 at 1440p. I saw anywhere from 240-280+ before locking it lower.
---
While on Pservers I was stuck at 60hz. Classic is pretty well built, only missing multicore due to being on the Legion client and not BfA. 
---
Hope this helps answer your question!
---
N o r t h d a l e
---
Omg yep
---
I only started having kids a few years back.  My first will be just old enough to be my personal fishing and gathering bot by the time classic rolls around.
---
Killswitch did a cover.
---
Warriors by Freedom Call
---
Ah, another account seller.
---
Warrior dont regenerate rage with shield up. Dont do that while leveling. Waste of time. Rather real and kite
---
Can you point out specifically where this happens in his guide? I've played it through on alliance more than horde , but can't recall this happening.
---
If a quest is too difficult, especially one 5 levels above, he has the player come back at another time or drops the quest
---
Most of the zones in his guide you visit multiple times
---
This is why  I am leveling my rogue as sub, it's just way more fun than cookie cutter combat swords.
---
Both. I can screw around retail. Finish story lines, farm mounts, etc
---
Sorry dude. No baby yet, still waiting... Wish classic were here already..so many precious hours lost 😋
---
This post was nice.  I really wanted to play druid and the class felt good at level 20.  But I always hear they are trash tanks and dps and can only heal and then are outclassed by every other healer so I was driven away.
---
I don’t have one. I could, but I dont. Why? It’ll be more fun to just make it up as I go. I don’t want to set a path for me to follow. Honestly that would make it no better than some of the hand holding in BFA.
---
Is there any greater joy than ganking some poor sap who is mere moments away from finishing this quest?
---
I will play both, they both offer different things. Classic is going to be fun when I just want to chill and grind, also griefieng is very satisfying on classic.
---
Why? Chances are he'll still have to masturbate, only now he has a wife to belittle him about masturbating.
---
The only thing retarded about Humans is the overpowered +5 sword skill.
---
This guy gets it
---
I was thinking about this last night. It could start off as them playing BfA talking about how its such shit and they miss the old days, then they see classic is coming out and then go off that some how.
---
Same as you.
---
I remember my first trip into MC with a belly formed guild that recruited up for that purpose, knowing nothing, hoping I didn't fuck up, and never realizing that pretty much everyone else was feeling the same way.
---
The guild leaders and officers were shooting their pants because they also had to manage the whole damn guild, devine the stats, or make it up as we went.
---
It was fine. It all went fine. No one cared that I was an orc Hunter rather than a Troll, and if a tranq shot missed guess what, the next Hunter in the rotation fired off.
---
Rag would go down in a few weeks. We figured out Only. BWL gave us delightful trouble but soon we had that on farm. It was fine. It was all perfectly fine. We had shadow priests, and enhancement shamans, feral druids and maybe even an oomkin.
---
It was fine.
---
The challenge isn't defeating the dungeons but loving your character and your role while you were doing it.
---
You’re missing the point. It’s not rewarding to him personally. Some people really enjoy cooking because the end result of the work they put in is rewarding to them. Some people enjoy washing their car because the end result of having a clean waxed car is rewarding to them. This guy is just saying the end result of having all the lock spells after farming shards doesn’t feel as rewarding to him as playing a mage does.
---
I don’t understand people like you that flat out tell people their completely subjective opinion is incorrect because you disagree with the reasons.
---
How so. The reply said ppl wrongfully assume DPS warriors are gear dependent and I am saying that assumption is correct. In poor gear DPS warrior is weak and scales insanely as the gear increases.
---
I upgraded my 256 MB RAM to 512 just so I could load Ironforge. Was a great day as a 13 year old.

---
Exercise a few days a week, achieving. 
---
Level 1 of every class to 120. Most I had at 110, but I had to level 3 new ones. I'll have that complete before the weekend. 3 levels left on a DK.
---
Play through Final Fantasy 6-9 to get away from WoW for a bit. Plan to start on that next week. Probably will only get through a couple of them. I like to waste a ton of time on the minigames lol. Card game and Blitzball the most.
---
Maybe min-maxers from other games are excited to min-max in this game. If "all fun is valid" your whole post is fucking stupid for bagging on people jazzed about raiding.
---
Updooted for undocumented though, lul.
---
Thats slow and clunky. We used to mock keyboard turners, but that would be much worse.
---
Racials, nerd.
---
Eh if I stay in instead of going out 1-2 times then the $30 paid for itself and I still had fun
---
And actual game footage is usually downvoted cause everyone hates streamers. Basically gotta wait till after launch.
---
Whats the point in making a karma reaping posts like this one then? ...
---
It's that the British server?
---
You're not wrong, whoever numbered the patches was.
---
You are missing the point. Your group is only as stealthy as your least stealthy member.
---
Unless everyone is investing in it(which is not the norm), then some of your group is sitting out the stealth portion of the campaign.
---
Since when was druid Hotw an unpopular build? It's one of the strongest hybrid builds around, capable of doing both pve and pvp quite well.
---
It's been very popular on private servers because of its versatility.
---
Unless we are talking Naxx or AQ40, Hotw is a very viable hybrid spec, quite popular amongst druids.
---
A man of culture i see
---
You can pickpocket toys, like worn troll dice.

---
&gt;The biggest vanilla raiding hurdle is going to be having 40 people show up on time and be able to have the mental capacity slightly above a brick.
---
you don't even need 40, I remember we cleared MC with about 15 people who didn't really contribute at all.
---
Last I heard the stress test was only for NA and oceanic regions. So I don't know if the EU active subscription will greenlight the test servers tomorrow. Time will tell.
---
Blood and Thunder
---
All of these can be improved.
---
Replace /cast with /use - shorter, can make all the difference in longer macros  
---
Replace [@player] with []  - much shorter  
---
Why does one macro use [target=player] and not the [@player] like the others?  
---
Macros don't need a ; at the end of a line  
---
[mod:alt] is longer than it needs to be if no other mods are required, just use [mod] and it will accept ctrl, alt or shift.
---
Replace /cancelaura Blue Skeletal Warhorse with /dismount - much shorter and doesn't need to be changed based on mount.
---
Hey man! Thanks a bunch once again. Nice with the bag upgrade as well!
---
Hopefully the Storyline addon will be available for launch. Check it out. It's awesome.
---
If we had real advice for every post like this that pops up, maybe people would actually get the memo. Vanilla is what you make of it. Let people play the classes and specs they want, and don't say absolutely dumb stuff like "Vanilla is not about raiding".  
---
If Vanilla is doing the raids for you, then you raid your ass off. If it's PvP, then go ham my dude. But don't let people and their self righteous talk about Vanilla being a certain way change your mind, because it's just like every other version of WoW, including live. It's exactly what you make it.  
---
Can we please ease up on the posts where OP tries to sound encouraging and just comes off as pushy? If people wanna try to contend with guys that have been min-maxing on private servers, then let them. Quite frankly, whether they played or not, they know what they want and how they want to play better then you do.
---
That goes down instead of up...
---
Whatever it takes
---
So... from what iv seen its only dwarf priests that get this bug. Possibly a mixture of using stone form and dying popping the spirit of redemption. A combination of those two might cause the immunity bug.
---
I read all the quest text because I didn’t know about quest helper and whatever, the only way to know where to go was to read the vague text
---
Always smile when a mom joke falls flat like that.
---
CHSIN LIGHTNINH
---
No
---
For me it is.  I hated leveling up, but the end game was insanely fun.  
---
I am not going to take my time during the leveling process, because to me it is just a boring grind that leads into a fantastic end game, where I feel the true game actually begins.
---
Oh god) this is made my day, thanks!)
---
I share this mentality and am sad by the lack of launch rp-pvp servers because Ive always felt this mindset is more common on rp or rp-pvp servers.
---
Does anyone know if all the old /funny jokes will be in classic? Or are they not "pc" enough for blizz anymore?
---
Must be a japanese WoW server
---
You can add a command to the end of a macro to prevent errors too.
---
/run UIErrorFrame:Clear();
---
Uh no bro he's using actual bis or near bis. It's not melee dps. I would guess he's using red dragon scale plate, mageblade is bis besides Lok and even then that's arguable
---
We paid 50$ for the demo a while back too
---
Are you really this stupid?
---
Same thing happened with OSRS
---
[This is the song that I most associate vanilla with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM6elRs7F5k)
---
Banned. What did I expect...
---
I personally think that the hardcore raiders will be that vocal group that will actively will complain the most after 4-6 weeks. The content of MC and even BWL is well known and it shouldn't take a prepared group a long time to finish them. But I assume it will take many months for Naxx/AQ to arrive and players who exclusively focus on raiding with a single toon will have absolutely nothing to do.
---
So long story short: if you want to enjoy most outbid classic, keep it slow and understand that the route becomes the destination.
---
What kid?
---
That changes nothing. They are Canon and part of Warcraft lore, for sure, but its still the one race which divided the player base the most.
---
Personally I've always felt they never belong. Like they were to far "off" from the original warcraft stories and books. Like they were forced in there because of the Asian theme. Someone wanted that in the lore.
---
I just wanna chill and chat while raiding easy content. Or running 5 mans slow, assigned kill priorities and CC.
---
Ran a BC timewalking dungeon tonight, seems I was the only one who knew it. Tank pulled nice and slow. Priority kill targets. CC actually used after we wiped a few times and I mentioned these dungeons were designed with using CC. Lots of silencing, stuns leading to tank agro loss, fears, healing trash mobs. It was a lovely hour or so. Felt like a real dungeon run, not some arcade smash em up. That's what I want all the time from classic.
---
I shrug IRL anytime I see a human Warlock or a human Mage. Absolutely no idea why they even exist.
---
I bet prison time really messed up their progression relative to the rest of the server.
---
It's about whatever the fuck we want it to be about.
---
If the paladin wields something like Vi'kag or halberd of smiting, would those physical procs be able to trigger seals such as this ?
---
note: thank you for a very nice and extensive explanation :)
---
I had to come back to upvote you. Never change.
---
Because gnomes are gross
---
LMAO
---
The thing I’m most excited for is tanking Wailing Caverns as a beartank and doing hunter BS in the deadmines for funsies. Plus, I live going Night Elf hunter, and waiting invisibly by the flag in WSG. Concussive shot and traps FOR DAYS.
---
You have a point there and I do believe no matter what happens after Naxx release the time period between Naxx and whatever comes after will be longer than Naxx to BC back in the day 
---
So indeed, might have the chance to gear all 3 if the time till new content is long enough to do so.
---
Do you plan on healing on your hunter? If not I don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
You know you have a point.
---
🔥🛫
---
never heard BIS in the early years of the game haha..
---
I love raiding though. But I played it because of the 40 peeps in a teamspeak room aspect having fun.
---
As a huge fan of the TCG and someone who has posted regarding this very issue, thank you for posting this, I completely missed it. 
---
Just for clarity, although Landro Longshot was only made available during patch 2.2.0 in The Burning Crusade expansion, the card set itself 'Heroes of Azeroth' was available for purchase on the 26th October 2006 which was during Vanilla, the card set included 3 'loot' cards. 
---
Collectors such as myself who have held onto these loot cards for a long time were just curious as to what blizzard were thinking regarding these items. 
---
The question was simple - TCG set was indeed available to purchase and play during vanilla, that being said, Landro wasn't available until the Burning Crusade, so, will we be able to redeem our loot cards or not?
---
As the blue post simply states, no - there will not be a way to redeem TCG cards in Classic WoW. 
---
I understand why, but I'm still sad. 
---
It looks like my Landro Longshot, Hippogrpyh Hatchling and Saltwater Snapjaw will go back into there hard cases and be filed away into my collection again. I really felt like these items added flavour into the game, and I'll certainly miss them not being in the World.
---
Trolls cant be warlocks, which makes me sad.
---
I'll be making an Orc Shaman on a PvE server, preferably the server with Alliance streamers, leveling him to 60 and getting a very fancy hat along with crummy looking clothing. 
---
My brother will create an Alliance character to eventually meet me somewhere secret, somewhere safe.
---
We'll then decipher Orcish to Common so I can run around Goldshire yelling "Mahhh wyfe!?" and "Very niiiiiice!" in Common. A true tourist Orc.
---
Open to new things to yell, just spit balling some basic ideas.
---
I think you got some bird shit on the top right corner
---
You forgot breaking be jamin, sool and sabaton
---
rep grind son.
---
Um... Blizzard has said themselves that its possible for them to continue on content after naxx... :| But yea... okay there bud
---
(4th Edition, and you're right)
---
Wouldn't Recommend Nelf Rogue, if you are choosing based on race specs, human and gnome are much stronger
---

Very nice

You’ve just solidified my choice of the alliance! FOR THE KING!

If your social life is WoW Classic and WoW Classic isn’t out yet, what does that say about your social life?
---
Keep them coming friend
---
Neither Lightning Shield nor Holy Shield can crit.
---
Each charge of Holy Shield scales with both Attack Power (5.6%) and Spell Power (9%).
---
I don’t really care about min/maxing since I like the way the elves look and the fact they can flip makes it rogue like to me in my head. Though it’s more of an identity
---
Agreed. I was more speaking for today's average player who probably wants flashy stuff happening all the time.
---
I think Raiding is awesome in Classic but for reasons that don't necessarily have much to do with the actual raiding itself.
---
I also think leveling is very fun in Classic, especially if you do it with someone. Tackling a 5 man Elite quest as a 3 man group is super fun. Planning ahead what's the most efficient route and way of doing things. It is not hard exactly but it is stimulating because you have to pay attention and plan things out.
---
Retail is just baby shit face roll, you face almost no problems whatsoever. Why play if the game doesn't challenge you? What fun is there then? We are beasts of burden and we like solving problems put in our path in order to get to the next step. Classic simulates moving towards a goal because there are real obstacles in our way that we have to work to get around or over.
---
Thanks!
---
When I was a freshman in highschool most of my close friends were people I had met online. We had a tight-knit group that spanned 4-5 years before WoW came out (we all met on X Box Live playing Halo 2 mainly). We would hangout in halo 2 lobby rooms for the voice comms and play WoW at the same time. This group fell out of touch after WoTLK-- and by that time we were all headed to college / getting jobs etc. I haven't played games with any of those guys in years-- but recently I started reaching out to them on facebook / bnet etc. So far I've got 3/5 of the old gang back! We're planning on rolling alliance. Funny how life goes.
---
I hear you mate. The sub is pretty stuffed with players going hardcore, the casual players that still want to enjoy endcontent seem to be left out a little. 
---
My intention is after work chill gaming for a little, and if there is a weekend day where it escalates to 8 hours, well there is. But all enjoyed in stressless manner with good vibes and buffs for everyone :)
---
Nope. You're the only one. Lucky guy!
---
Agreed removing the talent trees was one of the main factors in WoW's downfall.
---
Actually just had a look at it now. And I stopped using his guide for years because of this.
---
But it seems like he has changed it now since beta is out.
---
Anyways is was a follow up end quest to steelsnap from 1k. You have to kill frostmourne or something. Lvl 37 elite. And do this at lvl 30.
---
Obviously not doable on any other class. After that you go to arathi highlands and have to kill Raptors like 5 levels above you. At that point I just didnt go back to the guide.
---
But now i am eating my words since it's all chnaged on his site.
---
Lol you just have to scroll for 2 seconds to find several other people posting the same thing you fucker
---
so we're just gonna ignore the weird part in down with the sickness where he's like 'no mommy don't do it mommy i'll be a good boy' ? lmao they always play it at powerlifting events and i find it super weird
---
Amon Amarth before and up to With Oden On Our Side, music from Soldat (Necromancide, Bloody Soil, Gore) and Powerman 5000 were my jam in PvP.
---
lmao
---
is this dude really getting that mad that a beta has a bug?
---
Yes for a long time he said his guides were hunter specific, but he's done a ton of work they are great guides now!
---
Computers are better too. Playing at a solid 60fps in a 40-man raid at a higher screen resolution is a pretty big deal.
---
&gt;  If you tried to play Dungeons and Dragons in a way where the rogue and the wizard were equally powerful in all situations
---
They tried to do this, it was called 4th edition ;)
---
But, in all seriousness, I agree with you. I'd rather something be fun than perfectly balanced, and in fact, I think seeking perfect balance is often opposed to making it fun.
---
I completely agree that the "hybrid tax" should exist and should have always existed. Idk whether the balance was *right* in Vanilla - Rets are probably too shitty compared to Fury Warrs, even with utility factored in. But I think they had the right approach.
---
Leak Vael isn’t even a high dps check. You are fooling yourself thinking bosses are hard. I’ll gladly clear with oomkins, no ret paladins though since I’m rolling horde. I’ll take enhancement shamans in their place.
---
Your name is ironic.
---
Hope Classic treats you well friend!
---
Prior to 20, I strongly recommend you to pull separately. Both priest and warrior rely on time on target to actually get efficient dps (rend and shadow word: pain), and the warrior cannot reasonably engage more than once every ~15 seconds. 
---
What you want, I suspect, is for a priest to pull by shadow word paining, then your warrior charges for the stun/interrupt, pulling aggro, and fights that mob. Meanwhile, the priest pulls and fights a completely separate mob, and when practical, the warrior rends the priest's mobs, and you can try to work it so that you throw demoralizing shouts on both mobs. If you jump on the same mob, the warrior will be rage starved as you cannot actually generate much rage without charge and you just cannot stretch a duo kill time to 15 seconds: stuff dies much faster than that when you jump on each other's pulls. 
---
I would try to kill reasonably high level mobs, as of course, extra dot damage will mean you will be limited on engagements by charge when fighting weak mobs. 
---
At 20, you start AOEing. At this point, The warrior takes the lead, pulls mobs, and starts cleaving them down. The priest shadow words all relevant mobs, heals the tank up,  and then either wands down the weakest mob (cleave is not an unlimited use ability and it's still worth minimizing damage taken. Don't keep extra mobs alive just to allow the warrior to cleave more). 
---
You still want to be in arms. I think the priest probably wants to go a standard build reliant on wand specialization and spirit tap. I don't know the exact build. It's just "the priest opener". 
---
It is very important you set loot to free for all, because it's a colossal waste of time to run over and loot mobs. 
---
In terms of professions, I strongly strongly recommend you have an herbalist/alchemist.  A warrior is very much improved by potions, and it is much more realistic for a priest to drop big time efficient heals when the warrior and the priest both have large enough health pools to actually be safe while still dropping high rank slow heals (which are vastly more efficient than trying to screw around with power word shield and heal over time, which are not mana efficient.). But if you don't have the max health, you cannot safely cast big heals without overhealing.  In addition, as a clothie, the defense potions are very useful to a priest which is face tanking, and the mageroyal potions are not really useful to warriors, so you can funnel a LOT of mana potions to a leveling priest if you are herbing on one character.

**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
**PvE:**
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
* It would be great to get several farm groups going, so even if you just want to goof off and get carried by the main raid team through BWL while we're farming our 12th Ashkandi for a hunter... come on by!
---
* We will also be pushing AoTC and Mythic+10 content Horde side on retail WoW, so that option will also be available.
---
* Anyone that is also looking to participate in both retail and classic, this will be a great fit for you (though it's certainly not required).
---
**General Gaming Schedule:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends
---
**Raid Scheduled:**
---
* TBD, though our current Retail raid schedule is Wednesday/Thursday
---
If you are interested, please contact:

Must say I had the same experience a while back. Around 4hrs until level 10. After getting my pet it took off. I made the mistake of not straight up buying the level 3 white bow upgrade and using my beginner ranged wep until level 8 or so. Also the relics of awakening quest with 2 minute item respawn and 30sec mob respawn.

This is the crossover that was promised
---
Did I miss it or has nobody mentioned Drowning Pool?
---
let the bodies hit the floor... let the bodies hit the floor... let the bodies hit the floor... let the bodies hit the.........
---
I used to heal by having my camera zoomed all the way in and looking only at the floor and clicking icons. . Could get around 8 fps like that haha. Man those were the days.
---
It might not be replaced though, some classes have pre raid bis gear from places like maraudon and sunken temple even though its 40-50 level gear.
---
This is my exact thought. If at the very least they copy as many server names as possible there's a reasonable chance my old server name will appear.
---
As long as they also make the server type match I could meet people I haven't seen in 12 years, which is far more precious to me than naming after an epic item.
---
Torn between orc shaman ( first character and only main ever had) and the troll shaman... Since trolls are cool
---
Also I'm upset that I'm still not in the beta
---
"People like you". He is just asking a question tho, no need to judge him like this. He even says in his last sentence he prefers it in the way you have to deal damage to the boss to be eligible.
---
As you said, only raid gear will have the 2 hour trade limit, dungeon gear wont
---
My main will be on Leather Jerkin of the Eagle server
---
Thanks man!
---
I agree, I've estimated that 50% on the wow classic population stop before or at 10. Because they just don't think the gameplay is fun. And 50% of the remaining population stop before or at 20. I'm fairly sure only 25% of the people who start reaches 60. It may sound crazy that 75% of the population drops out before 21, but it is fairly common in games nowadays. Perhaps the majority in the community here will endure to 60. But many of us including me who played classic, thinks that we are one of the people who will make it. But there is a chance that we don't.. It's a really tough journey to level to 60, especially if you are alone..
---
I don't feel like carrying some cookie cutter spec because they are too bad at the game to get into a good guild.
---
Don't forget Rhapsody of Fire!
---
You're technically right, but Ska Punk, which is way different than the original Jamaican Ska didn't come around until way after Reggae. Like at least 20 years later.
---
That one Warrior video where he resurrects at the altar of storms or something
---
I don't know if you guys keep repeating that " never shield a warrior" comment whenever you can because you simply hear it all the time but I can tell you that if wow vanilla is anything close to my experience in vanilla private servers that YES its worth it while leveling outside dungeons to prepull with a shield on. Now thx for reminding me for the 6th time in this post cheer!
---
Shadowstrike.
---
I mean not necessarily.
---
It's true to say we don't know for sure if it has anything to do with launch but it's perfectly plausible that they're testing an intended number of servers for launch, or that they're trying to determine what number of servers they should have for launch.
---
I partly misread your post, you make a valid point with the tanks often preferring to take non plate dps. But a big part of pre bis warrior dps gear is leather or mail anyway, often loot that other dps want as well. Dungeons can just be run with a druid as tank though, they are actually very good in pre raid gear.
---
Source for fury warriors being amazing from the first raid tier can be found in this video. 
---
https://youtu.be/u0wciSPO9zg
---
I'm going to do the same, those cd-roms deserve a place on a wall or something. or at least on display
---
Then you still have the client installed from a previous stress test and you don't actually have beta access.
---
Agreed, or they just played later stages of Vanilla and didn't experience the higher leveled players yelling at us newbs in Stormwind trying to get a Deamines run going. Like fuck, fine...VC!!
---
You're pets going to be dead too often in the MC to make BM effective.
---
It's like highfiving yourself...
---
Can I get judgement of wisdom on the Mag please? I need to wand and afk. For some reason the bosses health isn't going down while I spam these fireballs at his face.
---
I know, crazy lucky!
---
Thanks for the second paragraph especially, I've been wondering about this! Hard to imagine that the 8 warrior thing was how Blizz intended the fight
---
But I also heard that you can teach resistances to your pet, and with proper microing it’s possible to have your pet survive most fights
---
Probably if your gear is shit. Any cat would be fine. Bribe a healer to keep your pet on their raid frames.
---
The range is [10yards](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=1449).
---
Myself did learn this quite fast on Nostalrius. I do not know if there is any footage of this method from classic beta, so this might also be a private server thing.
---
I agree. But it is a little stupid you still rent your character in this day and age. It's one of few MMOs that still charges a sub and I get it, but not having to pay $15 to play my character would be nice. It's 2019, this game has paid for itself a hundred times over by now.
---
Lol, no you spend money on a chance to get into the beta...
---
It's not strictly true when you have a debuff limit, since you effectively can limit how good your good players can be, but either way the idea of locking people out because of what they want to play only really applies to top end guilds.
---
I'm not gonna pretend I'm an experienced player, but I'll add my two cents nevertheless: if you plan to pour hundreds of hours into the game, you might as well pick another class along the way and level it up. Some people take the initial decisions way too seriously. Take it easy, unless you really really enjoy theorycrafting (I guess I'm not the only weirdo who likes the preparation phase of evaluating all the pros and cons even more than the actual gaming...).
---
It's only slightly better than MM if you have shit gear and that's only for yourself. When accounting for the +100 AP you give to the 4 other members of your group, BM is not worth it.
---
Yeah but supposedly BM is the highest damage dealing even with gear. Once a hunter gets 8/8 tier 2 they can expose weakness for the other hunters to do insane damage with tier 1 8/8. But for strictly MC before BWL if you want the most possible pure damage BM is the way to go
---
Yes. Semantic versioning.
---
Yeah MM is generally better with increased range and TS aura. But I’m looking at BM as a pure selfish damage spec
---
&gt;, when the BIS sword drops it goes to your best melee dps who consistently puts in the most effort. 
---
But if you really cared about progressing it would go to the person it's the biggest upgrade for.
---
Making things easier is not the classic way!
---
No. BM only outclasses MM when you have zero raid gear.
---
Well, a pinned post at the top mentions how they have decided to keep allowing classic wow posts there, so there was an attempt to ban it at least...
---
Next level Relationship goals!
---
I had to phone my mate and get him to log in to my account if I wanted to use the Zeppelin's to travel from Org-UC and vice versa because my game couldn't load fast enough and I would be stuck in an eternal loop of loading screens. The 128mb-512mb of RAM upgrade that fixed the issue is still to this day the biggest jump in performance I've ever seen in hardware, first dual core, first dedicated graphics card both included.
---
I dont understand the question? 
---
 seeing all content is like asking if i did lfr and lfd in modern? Or maybe all relevant lvl appropriate content? The 1-60 journey is content?
---
I played the game and i have played more time at max level then i ever have leveling. Even in vanilla i was an annoying kid that didnt do all too much "content" but i still did more at end game then i ever did while leveling. The game has a good system for leveling but its only in my opinion 1/4 of the game in terms of time and fun investment. The point of max is that you can do everything? 
---
I raided 1 - 2 days a week and took breaks. So fairly casually. Sometimes just pugged.
---
I ran dungeons when they had relevant things for me. Pugged or with friends. 
---
I pvp'd. However, rbgs and arena when they came out was at a very puggable level and mainly with which ever friend/s or guildie that wanted too. 
---
I farmed gold/rep/mounts and i chatted with friends. 
---
I dueled a bit. 
---
When pet battles came out i pet hunted.. 
---
I have had more fun and fun moments at max than i ever have leveling. I have had some great moments while leveling and the stories are nice. But i like playing with friends and more stuff with friends happen when you are at max. 
---
Like i have friends that wont hit max for a month maybe 3 and ill have other friends that will max in the first 2 weeks. Most wont be my level or follow my leveling speed. 
---
Yeah ill make new friends but ill fall behind them and they will fall behind me but at max we are all able to do all the casual content. We can all raid, dungeon, pvp, quest, farm and rp.
---
That's how you version software.
---
Interesting. T1 8/8 with that multishot damage increase it makes sense
---
Almost 19 gold for an hour at lvl 40 seems quite good.
---
Way better than your last test.
---
When you say "selling item - xxx golds" you're selling it to the merchant or to the AH ?
---
Thanks for the test.
---
For Molten Core it will probably be something like this:
---
1. Warrior
---
2. Rogue
---
3. Hunter
---
4. Mage
---
5. Warlock
---
6. ... Oh that's it? OK maybe someone will take a Feral Druid
---
7. Shaman
---
8. Paladin
---
And the dropoff between 5 and 6 is huge. It would be a bit better if Druids could get FAP weapons right away, but those don't show up until the AQ patch and by then they're even farther behind.
---
By Naxx it's:
---
1. Mage (Rolling Ignites are basically a bug they didn't fix)
---
2. Warrior
---
3. Rogue
---
4. Warlock
---
5. Hunter
---
and the rest won't even place on the list for funzies.
---
Warlock early solo leveling is vastly harder than private servers tho.
---
The fastest at 1-10 are most likely hunters and mages
---
Here’s a more comprehensive one but you’ve got the major ones https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpduxb/horde_rogue_sword_progression_onepager_for_your/

While the dark portal has been relevant since the RTS games, I think the intention is reinforcing how the login screen is the player's portal into the World of WarCraft.

Haven’t played retail since cata. Reactivated my account and had some fun looking over my old gear and achievements (last one dated 2011). Absolutely no interest in bfa
---
The Offspring was where it was at for me.
---
yo, someone actually found a way to shit on retail even there
---
You're pet will last about 1min on rag before it dies even with max fire resists.  Healers won't heal it.
---
I thought my friend was the only one
---
Did you try Sugar Free Gummy Bears ?
---
I think the raid orientation is because every form of progression in WoW content, story wise, has always been through the form of raids. From vanilla to BFA, the only way to have an idea of the linear story progression has been through raids. Obviously it doesn't matter as much in vanilla because like you and others said, there are plenty of other things to do however, because every feature most players have witnessed is solely so they can do better in raids is not surprising that retail players are a bit skeptical about what to do at 60. 
---
I myself will probably be aiming for raids as I was primarily a retail llayer, but I'm not going to let it stop me from trying everything else.
---
This is how it really feels: [https://imgur.com/lJBD24M](https://imgur.com/lJBD24M)
---
I’m maining 2 classes and switching between them for rest xp so maybe you could do warrior AND rogue
---
I get the roleplay aspect of it, I do. But at the end of the day there's someone on the other end of the keyboard.
---
If I wouldn't want it to happen to me, I don't do it to others.
---
One! Nothing wrong with me!
---
Sometimes - and this is a closely guarded secret so listen close - sometimes, people make mistakes.
---
Resistance training was BC i think. As for microing, too often your pet gets killed by aoe dmg plus healers rarely heal your pet. Just try it but from my experience its not worth.
---
In classic you had to be in range of the boss, but didn’t have to attack it. Me and my brother would farm gear on twinks that way. How we gauged distance was zooming the map all the way out and it we’re both in the circle you can get loot. Same with xp, if you were trying to avoid it, be outside the instance or out of frame on the map
---
Wow lots of nice tips for the same combo I'm currently trying for wow classic! And your priest should be tailoring / X 
---
Make sure your priest get her wand asap with the enchanting / tailoring trick. Low level you don't always want to multi dot the enemy my war friend got a tough time keeping aggro on everything I usualy let him face pull 2 3 mobs sometimes with pre shield (yes yes yes it gonna rage starve u a bit but you might already have rage and just white auto attack tab target will allow ur priest to dot tab.) and then we nuke 1 mob at a time with my wand. Keep in mind you will get parried, dodge, miss a lot with a slow 2 hand so it's very tough to actually be able to generate treat low level against higher lvl mob) GL!
---
This meme doesn't comfort me
---
BATHROOM! BATHROOM!
---
&gt; - I've seen players just disappear in front me of
---
Those are rogues, druids, possibly random night elves.
---
&gt; - I've been told 'theres a huge battle going on at Crossroads (for example)' only for me to be on my own when I get there
---
You've fallen for the classic blunder.  Classic Barrens Chat.
---
Hell yea, can't wait to hear about RFD. I've read that it's the best place for rogue pickpocket farming. Thank you!
---
from that bunch i'd probably be a ret paladin, i like two handers and buffing people... i guess Enhance shaman is on the menu too.  
---
So probably Enhancement shaman because totems are pretty.
---
Resistance training is in vanilla. But true marksman just seems more reliable and good for pvp
---
I am a human IRL... I want to be a human who can summon demons and rain hellfire in my enemies, but alas I can only do that in the virtual world. However, I’d prefer not to have green skin, rotting flesh, or be a gnome lol
---
You're actually better off with a Warrior or Hunter using Nightfall. They can spam Hamstring or Wing Clip a lot faster than a Ret or Enhancement can swing which means more buff uptime.
---
I have a similar plan that can go one of two ways. 
---
* Activate two accounts
---
* Dual box Mage and Hunter
---
* Dual box Priest and Warlock
---
* Dual box Druid and Rouge
---
* Dual box warrior and shaman
---
* Names of second account will be feminine so I can say it's my wife playing without having to explain dual boxing to groups.
---
* Mage will be primary main. Skinning/tailoring
---
* Hunter Leather Working/Herbalist
---
* Warrior will start as bank alt with enchanting
---
* Ultimately have all professions across the set of characters
---
* Skinner has leather worker build things to disenchant.
---
* Be able to make wands for alts/ah on my own
---
* Power the sets to 60 then transfer all to single account and cancel the secondary account.
---
* For mage, grind reputation while leveling for tailoring items.
---
An alternative plan is two focus on my mage first. Get BIS raid ready. Then activate 2-3 accounts and use the mage to power level the characters up to 45 or so (sfk,sm,zf) then multi box the set until the end of the month and transfer everything over.
---
I did something similar to this the last time I returned to wow.
---
I don't like it. I don't think anyone wants layering. Its a means to an end. Its the lesser evil.
---
Through layering, we all can rest assured that no server will be a low population graveyard. The value in that seems worth the temporary layering.
---
It's almost enough to make me not want to play the game personally. 
---
One of the things I love about the original levelling experience is the friendship you strike up with people along the way. Sure the starting zones are a mess but you hit the 20+ zones and you see some folks on a quest and join up briefly. 
---
Later at level 30something you see them again and catch up. This time you chat more and maybe add them as a friend. 
---
Later at level 40something you quest with them purposefully and run a dungeon. 
---
You form or join a guild with them because why the hell not. 
---
Then you hit level 60 and you can't even remember how you met them but this person is one of your OG in game crew on raiding teams or pvp and it's all happened naturally. 
---
Layering prevents this and I hate it. I get that it's gonna be busy but just make a few more damned servers and stop pretending it's not going to be more popular than retail. Or have reactive respawns i.e relative to how many people are in a zone sets the respawn time.
---
BM has its worth for solo or 5mans where in some situations its really fun.
---
The way you seem to define balance, it's probably true. But to me balance is more about everything being on par overall. If there is just one class that is just straight up unbalanced and bad design. Sure, a mage should have different strengths and weakness than a rogue and play differently, too. But they should be similarly powerful.
---
To get back to the specific issue: a hybrid class, which is supposed to also have a dps role, should imo not be a worse dps than a pure dps close. Because depending on the spec, the hybrid focuses on the role, thus giving up it's potential power of utility. For feral druids this case gets really apparent: they do shit damage compared to dps classes, but don't really have that much utility for the raid either.
---
A lot of people learned what a graphics card was and bought one because of wow haha
---
Since when? I returned to WoW after taking a 7 long year break in 2011 and all the names were still intact.
---
It's great when you have a lot of butt hair and all the poop gets stuck between the hairs.    
---
Using a bidet will wash all that right off where as you might risk some of those bastards sticking around if you just wipe.
---
Inb4 this is just a ploy so the elitist gamers can stomp the competition even more!
---
No but in all honesty I do agree, I wish I could have this mindset.
---
That's not really accurate. Most people hit 60, it's just a time sink and no real skill or even understanding of the game is required. Lots of people ran 5 man dungeons, UBRS, and BGs when they came out and that was enough for them. Quite a few ran MC a few times but no further. What was fairly rare, relatively speaking, were people who progressed through BWL and into AQ, then Naxx. Especially on smaller servers, or if you happened to pick a faction on a server that was dominated by the other side. Dependable progression raiders were pretty rare.
---
Let me play how I want.
---
Sounds like having kids is daily thing to you. Are you by any chance Genghis Khan?
---
But there may/will be low population graveyard layers.
---
&gt; DPS warriors aren't as gear dependent as people assume. ... They do fine in bad gear, and insane in good gear.
---
&gt;I am not sure I agree. A DPS warrior with a proper epic weapon will do much higher damage than with a poorly itemized blue.
---
You're agreeing with his point but you're saying that you disagree.
---
The only good thing about Classic so far is that it will allow for more accurate private servers.
---
Avenged Sevenfold are still a jam to this day, though their style changes by every album.
---
It looks identical to the one that's on my vanilla box on my desk.. It's not going to change, nor should it.
---
Actually no, I didn't realy consider that. I always had proper tank warris or totally overgeared ones. At least I always believed that to be the case but with no talent inspect I mightve just fooled myself for 15 years lol
---
Fuck off blueberry
---
&gt; But I think they had the right approach.
---
They definitely did.  In a perfect incarnation of WoW, I think the hierarchy of DPS would probably be:
---
1.  Pure DPS melee (rogues)
---
2.  Pure DPS ranged without a pet (mages)
---
3.  Pure DPS ranged with a pet (hunter/lock)
---
4.  2-role DPS melee (warriors)
---
5.  2-role DPS ranged (priests)
---
6.  3-role DPS melee (cats/ret/enh)
---
7.  3-role DPS ranged (boomkin/ele)
---
But then have the hierarchy of raid/pvp utility be basically the opposite of that.
---
Vanilla didn't do it perfectly, but it was pretty damn good.
---
I really like anecdotes like this. That upgrade must have felt great.
---
Hardware wise this is like my jump from 56k to 10mbit fiber in 2003...
---
Ah, yes. The powerpoint raiding days.
---
Your pet will die on every boss fight within 30 seconds. And it’s hard to get a raid spot without trueshot aura. Without it you’re a dead slot.
---
I think it will be used very sparingly, to the point where it will only happen if there is truly a huge amount of people in one area.
---
So at launch, in the leveling zones. And after that I can't really seem to think that they will use it more.  You have to remember, Classic is much simpler than retail in the data that needs to be transmitted so they can go much, much further before they "have to" layer. Like we are talking like 6+ raids in one spot I think.
---
Part of me is hoping that they spin up new servers for each phase, so for example you can start from scratch on a new server in Phase 4. That would more accurately recreate the experience for people who started playing Summer 2005.
---
But that would cost money, money they need to help prop up BFAs revenue. More subs makes BFA look “good” on paper. When I fact those fresh subs most likely won’t spend a week in BFA. 
---
I agree stand up a few more servers between now and launch, scrap layering and in the end have a happier healthier classic community.
---
Yes!
---
It was one of those "This is the future" moments that will stick with me until my memory fades.
---
That's an impressive speed jump you had!
---
You don't need all 8 in prot spec in almost all circumstances. Also note that you can take more than 8 warriors, they are very good as both tanks and dps. You certainly wouldn't want to build a guild with fewer warriors than that if you have aspirations of clearing Naxx. 
---
As for 4hm, I didn't do it in original vanilla, but based my private server experience it can be helpful (but probably not necessary) to have some or all dps warriors Respec protection for 4hm progression. Yes that can mean 100g in respecs for 1 raid night, which the guild bank may or may not be able to assist with. While you're learning the fight every little bit of advantage helps, it is chaotic. As the raid becomes more experienced with it and better geared, I'm sure you can get away with having your fury warriors tank as fury for 4hm. 
---
Generally speaking 2 or 3 prot warriors in a 40-man raid is sufficient for a normal raid comp. Sometimes fury warriors offtank things, sometimes they might go a whole raid doing only dps. But generally any warrior in a raid, no matter the spec, will have their tank gear in their bags ready to suit up and take hits if needed.
---
No, you dont Seem to get why blizz goes with layering.
---
Maydie. The reason i been playing a warrior for 18 year9
---
I was born 2001. Was like 3 when the game came out, so does this apply to me lol? i mean i was too young to play. i didnt even get internet till like i was 7.
---
i'm guessing AH. And that makes the gold he makes abit off. Classic beta will have a large market for healing pots (which is 5g out of \~19g he got) due to people pvping at lvl 40 now.. While on release the market will not be as big for low level healing pots, resulting in lower prices or not even selling the pots at all...
---
At MC level hunters actually do pretty decent damage. Plus with kiting and tranq they are definitely not a dead slot without TS aura. I will agree it’s pretty selfish not to bring and early in it’s a very nice buff to bring.
---
Legitimately I am working on a “chill/gathering/farming mix” and a “BG angsty mix” with a lot of Rise Against and Boy Sets Fire etc. Will for sure be throwing a couple of these in there.
---
Yup, there will be and that will be fine.  
---
But when a WPVP battle starts and everyone runs to the area, so will the layering start.
---
Seems like PP farming won’t be worth it in Classic? I’m really curious about RFD because that’s the big farming spot on private servers. Mobs drop lots of Rogue Diary’s and they vendor for 45 silver each.
---
Cap != optimal amount
---
Thank you so much for this! Been waiting for someone to do this and now I can finally be kind of relieved that my 9 year old desktop (given it was high end back then) can run classic without problems 🙂
---
Its till friday?! I dont have to stay awake till 4 in the morning in order to play?! Nice!
---
got ubrs key give me lead and lootmaster :)
---
It's not just the tier set bonus. Your pet doesn't scale with your gear.
---
By going BM, you miss out on:
---
* 15% Multi-Shot damage
---
* 5% damage to all ranged attacks
---
* Trueshot Aura
---
* 6% extra bonus from Hunter's Mark
---
The first two both scale heavily with gear.
---
In exchange you get:
---
* 30% pet movement speed
---
* A 3 second pet stun you can't use in raids
---
* 20% pet focus regeneration
---
* 30% pet attack speed on crits (4.4% chance on bosses)
---
* An 18 second 50% pet damage buff on a 2 minute cooldown.
---
None of that scales with gear.
---
Higi
---
CANT WAKE UP
---
higi?!
---
Be a total noob. Learn the class as you Level and enjoy your first time in a game that people have been waiting for the past decade and a half.
---
That’s a fair point. MM seems superior in every way, I just heard about BM being super good and idk how troll it really is
---
Yeah typed hihi wrong
---
Surely you're trolling haha
---
So bizzare. Strange things like this have been happening so frequently with WoW Classic.
---
oh lol
---
Listened to Unholy Confessions by A7X too many times on repeat, that even now 10+ years later the lyrics are still ingrained into my brain.
---
I play at 144hz on both private servers and Classic. I don’t see why 240hz wouldn’t be possible. If you see screen tearing then enable Gsync/freesync/Vsync and you’ll have 0 screen tearing.
---
That's why the priest pulls. You don't WANT the warrior to have aggro. the priest is more than capable of just face tanking mobs, it's what you do solo. And if the priest pulls, the mobs are hitting no one on the way to the priest. And the warrior, for large pulls, can just move his mob over to the priest and then pick up aggro on the third target with a rend and posisbly as shout or a thunderclap.  
---
For a dual spawn, it also lets the warrior charge the lead mob, and move with the pack, rending the other mobs, and then fight the mob he charged. The priest will need to face tank much less due to rend, and the warrior will not take a huge beating because he is only tanking one mob at a time. If the priest is worried about pulling aggro... just try to work it so the priest doesn't have to heal until after the fight, and don't shadow word pain more than 2 mobs. Then the warrior can easily pull mobs off the priest with any damage he likes. 
---
In fact, early on, the warrior is not even much tankier than the priest. 1-10, you won't have the armor to get much above 25% damage mitigation. 
---
I don't know the priest damage mitigation, but I think you basically get the first 10% just for showing up. Doubly so with an elixir of defense (one of the potions a priest really benefits from, along with troll's blood and the max stamina one at skill 50). 
---
The real warrior mitigation doesn't show up until you start getting full sets of at least white quality mail, and a decent shield (which the warrior might not even have if he's not starting as human... I don't think dwarves or orcs use shields early). In addition, if you spread damage across both characters, you will not find the healer has to break mp5 to start panic healing the warrior:  You can safely batch your spells in a way you really can't if the plan is for the warrior to charge in and tank 3 mobs with his 25% or worse damage mitigation. 
---
Really, I feel the biggest trap that warrior/priest can run into is relying too much on healing. Healing occasionally is great. It's a mana and time efficient way to reduce downtime, and a way to substitute very low value spells (like smite) for higher value ones (like the slow heal). But it's better to rely on the tricks solo priests and warriors use to mitigate damage: space and movement time.
---
Yup. Never Raided. The best fun was the 5 person groups on the way up - as long as you were semi-competant your gear and spec didn't matter at all.
---
Yeah but it won’t REALLY be my first time. I played vanilla when I was 9 or 10 for a little while, but it was too hard for me. I loved watching my friends older bros play though, so I want to be at least okay at it this time.
---
No doubt. Or the “hey there’s a huge battle here meet me in town I’m in a full group but you can tag along”. Right n to the town to find nobody, ask buddy “hey where you guys at I’m here” buddy:”we’re still here waiting for you” responding to buddy “shoe I got fucked by layering, have fun at that fight”.
---
So does that mean you never roll on any loot because you wouldn't want others to feel disappointment over losing the roll?
---
The Golden Rule has no place in war.
---
I've got a full time job and am invested in playing a couple different fighting games. All I want is to re-live that slow questing experience in a cohesive world with an unforgiving wilderness. Never played vanilla WoW, instead what I'm nostalgic about is FFXI.
---
I remember traveling through 40-50 and 50-60 zones as a level 35 white mage, carefully trying to experience each type of extreme weather in the game in order to unlock the summoner job. Dying meant losing something like 30% of the xp needed to level up and could even de-level you. I spent a week and a half, a ton of gil, and lost 1.5 levels trying to unlock the summoner job.
---
I remember hiding in the captains quarters of a ship because level 50+ sea monsters invaded the ship.
---
I remember quests taking me to dark dungeons I'd never been to and requiring me to procure an inventory to complete.
---
I want to play a game with an unforgiving wilderness that has a ton to be explored. Where leveling *is* a core part of the game, not a grind.
---
You need better sources.
---
Id be glad it happened now instead of in 2 months lol...
---
totally agree - Play the game, maybe google a lvl spec if you REALLY don't know what to do with talents, but just play it.
---
Don't even mind about BiS preraid or raid spec before even hitting 55.
---
The grind to 60 is long and fun, but most newcomers won't make it halfway there.
---
It's dwarves though, isn't it?
---
Sounds like you were getting too excited for the test. 
---
Stop masturbating in front of your girlfriend - especially when the material is way more exciting and interesting than her.

Yes they do but most people don’t know it. The only thing they’ll notice is that the melee group 5 is lacking TS and they’ll remember not to invite you next week.
---
DONT YOU KNOW PUMP IT UP
---
I think a good hybrid class *can* work. It just takes some smart design. A player that can do 80% of the dps of a dedicated dps or 80% of the healing of a dedicated healer isn't worth much if he can only do one of those jobs at a time. He's always running at only 80%. But if he found some way to do both at the same time, such as dealing damage to enemies to heal allies? Then even if he's only at 80% dps and *20%* healing he's doing both at the same time so it adds up to the full 100%.
---
So you're a tanky healer? Use your health as a resource to protect your targets health. (See Blessing of Sacrifice)  
---
You're a tank with heals? Use those heals to build threat and top off your health.  
---
Healer with Dps? Use your damage to heal. (See Atonement)  
---
Tank with dps? Use your damage to build more threat.  
---
etc.
---
Each of your capabilities should work together, not just sit there completely separate.
---
1 minute in to the video and the PvP hasn't started #nochanges.
---
Yeah well, staying tank at level 60 is only viable for very few raiders and those players, that don't want to raid at all but do mostly dungeons instead.
---
Everyone else switches to their end game spec, be it for pvp, dps or healing.
---
Good point. People usually only take things at face value. Regardless with rhok in MM a hunter can whip out some insane damage for MC standards
---
I HIGHLY doubt they would let you ever keep a stress test character going into live. That would be terrible.
---

Sure, I thought I should have rephrased it "Too young to play when WoW came out" but had already posted, lol
---
Me2!!
---
Then explain it? Ive been trying to.
---
Honestly, filtering out the people that don't want to put in the effort isn't a bad thing. Making them work for it is even better. Vanilla was full of casual players that made it past level 7.
---
I remember helping my son with a game he was playing when he was younger. He would get stuck in a level and ask me to get him past that point. I made the mistake of getting him past it. As the levels got harder and harder, he needed me to help him. Eventually he got to a point where everything was too hard and he didn't want to play any more.
---
I figured this out rather quickly so from then on, I never got him past challenges in games. Each challenge is there to for you to learn how to overcome it. He needed to learn those lessons.
---
So when he would ask me to help, I would say sure, and then fail miserably at it. I would suck so bad that he would get frustrated at watching me try and take the controller back. 
---
Today, he is actually better at several games than I am so it's not an act. But worked. He learned that he would have to practice or figure it out on his own and he sticks with games a lot longer.

Mine was in 2004, I went from a 400 MHz Celeron with 8 MB graphics card and 192 MB RAM to a Pentium 4 3.2 GHz with Hyper-threading, 512 MB RAM, and a 128 MB Radeon X300SE graphics card.  I went from getting like 10-15 FPS in Counter-Strike 1.5 at 400x300 resolution to getting smooth frame rates in Counter-Strike: Source at 1024x768.
---
Nowadays everything is already so god damn fast the difference is minimal compared to then.  You can play at ultra instead of medium-high and get smooth frame rate vs being able to play at all back then.

Now that's poetry!
---
Im not entirely sure yet. Depends on what my IRL mates want to roll. If alliance then nelf and if Horde then most likely troll or maybe orc.
---
I raided Fury in for 2-3 years in the top Alliance guild on my server and I would have to be bribed to try doing anything like that again. The good parts were really great, but I had to work my ***ass*** off to earn them.
---
Soilwork anyone?
---
Vanilla was about the journey to 60 and beyond. I for example I didn‘t raid that much. I just farmed a ton of herbs and made a lot of money with it. My endgame was farming gold and 5 man dungeons. There was always plenty to do for me. My best friend on the other side was heavy into raiding and he spend this time in mc, aq and naxx. So there is something for everyone. That‘s the beauty of this 15 years old game
---
ow the fuck does that happen?

I won't get BFA either, I resubbed recently just to mess in BGs on my lower lvl alts... Yeah cata was the beginning of the end imo.

Quote listed from what was linked, super helpful right up in regards to my question. Thanks again,
---
"So first of all if Player level &lt; mobs level. (yellow, orange, red)
---
Bonus xp you get is minimal, you get +5% bonus for each level difference, then bonus xp you get caps quite fast at 20% (+4lvls to you) and doesnt grow anymore. And its consistent for all levels.
---
So, for instance, if you are lvl10 killing lvl10 mob (yellow, you gain 95xp, we take it as 100%xp). now, if you are lvl10 killing lvl11 mob (yellow), you only get 5% bonus (105%). for level 12 mob (still yellow), 10% bonus xp, (110%), level13 (orange mob) 15% bonus xp (115%), and then at +4 levels, it caps at 20% and never grows, even if you kill a red mob 8 levels higher then you. you still only get 120% xp.
---
So in conclusion, you should preferably kill mobs of your level or lower, cos additional time you are spending dealing with higher level mobs isnt worth the xp bonus in most of the cases. 
---
even if you killed mob 1 level higher than your level, you get pretty much the same xp, as for the same level mob. 5% bonus isnt something, that significant. so killing even some yellow mobs, if its killing yellow mobs higher than your level isnt that profitable, and doesnt give much, but may take more time to kill such mob compared to the same level to your level mob. 
---
~
---
now if player level &gt; mob level. (yellow, green, gray)
---
its very dynamic by players level. at lower levels, xp drop is drastic. Killing mobs even 1 level lower than you results in quite significant xp cut. for instance at level 8 killing level 7 mob, its -20%, you only get 80% compared to if you killed a mob of your level. and a first green mob (-3 level to player level) will only give 40% xp. 
---
though at higher levels, this dynamic changes. If a mob is 1 level lower than players level xp cut isnt that big at all, at level 56 you get 94% of xp compared to xp killing the mob of equal level. so its only -6% cut. 
---
And for lower mobs, for instance first green mobs (-3lvls) you get 81%. (-4lvls) 75% xp. So the cut is here, but green mobs are usually much faster to kill, but they still give a very decent xp amount. 
---
So at higher levels its not that bad of an idea, to fast grind some green mobs. you still get tons of xp. though green mobs dont turn gray for much longer (goes deeper), so dont go too far back. thats why i made this grid in %, to evaluate all this jazz on a different levels. and what gives what at what level, and what is worth the time or not. and which mobs would be effective to grind and which not."
---
On private servers, higher refresh rates were not compatible even if it showed them in the dropdown list, the highest you could select was 120hz.
---
I have a 144hz and when I would select it, the default 60hz would be applied, but when I selected 120hz it worked and looked very nice (its vanilla ffs).

Lvl 5 is nothing.
---
There is no time limit in trials to hit 20.
---
You won’t experience shit at level 5.
---
Only for Huntards
---
Absolutely correct.
---
and yet, though it could be perceived as elitist or whatever, i think it is important to have hard raids/content like that. it really builds the game's mystique, creates a sense of awe/wonder/hugeness/etc. when you have some content that's really scary that most people can't even touch
---
Keep doing the lords work
---
wait it scales from both!!!?
---
Another question: do the seals scale ? i have been playing horde since middle of original vanilla when i stopped at lvl 42-43 druid and then went 100% horde since and now with classic re-launch i will once more try alliance side :)
---
Dunno what the script for it will be, but you'll want to attach a command for turning your auto attack on to a couple of your macros.  I have one for single target and one that includes cleave.
---
Thanks for this
---
Hey thanks for responding! hats good, i was thinking of going Arms as i want to be PvP focussed but i was hoping not to respec for raids if possible. I suppose, especially early on my PvE damage as 31/20 arms won't be too far behind Fury as the Fury warriors i'll be competing with will suffer a lot from low hit rating?  
---
Also, i've heard a good player can competently tank dungeons in any spec provided you have a set of gear that favours tank stats, do you know if its viable to tank top end dungeons out of Prot spec? i'm lvling with a large group of friends so i'll more often than not be running with friends meaning i have willing healers/dps. More a question of whether we'll be able to make it through the content as 31/20 Arms or whether i'm really wasting my time. I know it won't be optimal of course, but do you think it could be overcome?
---

Daft Punk while grinding to stay in the zone, gotta get to 60.
---
Do people not read/look for posts before they post their own? Yes, everyone else in NA/Oceanic with a restarted battle net client sees the same.
---
I agree with u/RedRageRooster the only way to learn a class is to go through it the hard way.  There are plenty of guides out there to help you decide on builds but the mechanics you need to pick up through trial and error, you'll be much better for it.  Also macros are fantastic and I do suggest you make some after you learn more about the skills and move the class provides.
---
And the sticky mouse or keyboard - whichever hand is preferred.

Same here. Then just fool around in PvP

Everyone ? No, there is this little continent called Europe.
---
Got really excited when I started reading the blu post until i hit the „only NA and Oceania“ part.
---
Yeah my concern is the game will be too easy. We already recently found out that classic is easier than private servers. I think that people are fearful because they are recalling their 2005 days when MMOs were new and everyone was 10-15 years old didn't know what they were doing.

None. Any of the crafted weapon oils is better.

Im in mobile rn, but there are already hundreds of Posts about layering and why its a necessity, Just use the search function.

According to the Blu post there are.

What?

A+
---
I can only tell from personal preference that I used Frostbrand in Vanilla (not private service). Youd pretty much always use Frost Shock on melees but  when Frostbrand procced you could then use Flame Shock instead which prevented them from using first aid/eat or a rogue to stealth. I cant remember if the spell damage component stacked with spell power.
---
The context was most likely that when you ding fresh 60 you usually stay BM until you get preraid bis. Nobody ever said BM is better than MM in raiding.
---
I barely managed 10 FPS while questing. I honestly don't know how the fuck I played back then. I had a friend who used to get 30 FPS and I thought his PC must be a total beast.
---
presumably, /startattack will still work.
---
System of a Down.
---
Also, there’s 15 videos, 1 hour long each on YouTube of “Old school WoW PvP music” You’re welcome.
---
I was a hardcore casual back when it came out. I played for 4-5 months and never got a character to 60.  After I came back to the game after a short hiatus, I finally got a couple characters to 60. I think I stepped into a couple MC pugs briefly, none were super successful.
---
I played a LOT of vanilla, and I'm looking forward to classic, but I really doubt I'm going to do much raiding.
---
As you mention, it's something I really miss about vanilla, that leveling to 60 WAS the game, I was barely even aware of raids for the longest time.
---
So it's only in NA/Oceanic? Interesting
---
yep. all these things are going to make the content pretty trivial (at least the majority of it) to be honest with straight blizzlike values, unless they decide to buff it at some point
---
I was referring the PowerPoint kargoz briefed over. It’s a field Manuel that was made by some of the best hunters. That’s where I got the knowledge from but he didn’t go in depth with the spec at all
---
It's crazy just how badly removing Crusader Strike fucked Retribution. I imagine if they didn't remove it, the Alliance vs Horde dynamic in PvE and PvP would be wildly different than it is, with just that one ability.
---
You made this entire post and didnt bother to learn how healing works?
---
Make sure the rules are known and explained before the raid starts. It's the guilds reputation that is on the line after that. Get them to clarify your concerns.
---
Ask them who gets to roll or when they can roll. Is it raid spec over pvp, mains vs alts, main tank gets priority, reserved list, tanks over dps, healers over dps. Is it actually rolls or loot council or gold for purples? if loot council, who are the observers for this raid and what is the decision based off of?
---
Used to dps and tank like that. Learned before the fight where I should go in case movement was needed. 
---
My pc was not rendering spells on the ground either.
---
Sharp eyes! :D
---
Thats why im playing Horde. I played alliance back in the day
---
agree completely with your replies.
---
Shouldn’t that only affect Chinese servers 
---
Like their unique undead model
---
It would've given rets something reliable, which they absolutely definitely needed.
---
For me, I played the hell out of Vanilla, loved it to pieces, but wasn't a Raider at the time.  And that's fine.
---
But asking what's BiS, and for a good spec, helps give me a long term target to work towards, as otherwise my ADD is going to kick in and I'm going to become the tauren druid kitty that got lost in alliance territory chasing a squirrel and wondered why...
---
Hey what's that over there!

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. 
---
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 
---
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Many people here didn't actually play Vanilla and know little about it. With that said, this thought process is coming from the fact that Blizzard allowed the vanilla ce pets to be redeemable in classic. This raised the question of if those who supported the TCG would get the same benefit.
---
Yeah but the beta test is open to all regions right now.
---
Classic only.
---
Funny how listening to certain songs bring back memories of certain games. Whenever I listen to David Hillyard I think of running through the Barrens questing on my Undead Warrior. Dragonforce and Muse make me think of playing TBC too.

Holy paladins are great for pug pvp. The downside, of course, is that you will never be able to trust pug players to protect their healer. Not in 10-19 wsg and not in 60 AV. You will have entire games where there is absolutely nothing you can do to change the outcome of a game as a healer because your team simply will not cooperate.

I agree in that WoW was ahead of it's time, but I think many of those same feelings will come again. You'll probably be surprised at how many new players WoW Classic will pick up. 😁🤘
---
Whilst those things were great, it's not why I loved WoW. It was the sense of community. People had to communicate. You didn't just fire into a dungeon, not speak and complete it without uttering a word. Not even a "hi". You couldn't just fire on a flying mount and get to your destination whilst you AFK and avoid any interaction whatsoever.
---
Soilwork!
---
I dont think you are going to get great answers, because all of the macro/addon LUA code was redone for classic. Meaning a LOT of macros that worked in vanilla 1.12 wont work at ALL in 1.13 classic.
---
I totally agree, post yours too and let me know how it turns out!
---
Do you want to beg for lockboxes, be everyone chef or be a glorified taxi and medic?
---
This time around, I'm just going to level a farming alt. Have other characters for the other aspects of the game.
---
Pickpocket farming was never really worth it in vanilla either. I mean it was *something*, just not an amazingly effective method of making gold. Could make way more more just farming and selling runecloth.
---
Pre-60 it might hold a bit more weight though.

You gear up and then a year later you are redoing it over again in the next expansion, or on a new character.

Outside of the joy of vanilla levelling - I wouldn’t subject myself to something I find boring such as raiding.

I like to read books in my spare time - my coworkers think that’s a really boring trait and a waste of time.

Just because they say that doesn’t mean it applies to me.
---
Stop taking things personally - it is a general question about who isn’t interested in endgame - unlike the thousands of min-maxers on this reddit.
---
You chose to take my personal remark about what I find fun or boring as a personal attack on your life.
---
Ya, mon. You tell 'em.
---
I loved Holy because you can make good PvP specs with it while still being great in PvE.
---
Alright everybody look down and zoom into the ground in 3, 2, 1, go. Yes, only 13 people dc'd.
---
Have you even remotely researched and saw the shear number of people playing on private servers still and how many people have took to them to test their leveling strategy and get refreshed for Classic?
---
Kevin Jordan and others have called it... Classic is going to knock it out of the park and make the developers working on retail WoW sit up and take stock and go back to the drawing board.
---
Vanilla WoW is a cruise ship. Enjoy the journey to lvl 60.
---
The blue posts literally say that you get access to the beta if you have an active sub. And even at that, don't sub for a chance at the beta. The invites are very sparse.
---
If you pick a NE druid over a troll shaman I will personally slap you, and then slap your mother.
---
Retail. Players....
---
Cant understand how to not pick alliance skiping Elwyn, Westfall, Redridge...when the music plays and Im happily grinding murlocs and defias..Yes I am home
---
Give him a medal mate.
---
&gt;  Paladins do not have access to any AoE ability unless they spend 11 points into holy, which is counter intuitive if your goal is to tank.
---
That's a pretty weak argument. 11 holy isn't a big investment (and early it was 21 ret), it's not like, you have to spec completely different. On top of that, consecration is MUCH better than any druid or warrior aoe ability, when it comes to tanking. The lack of taunt is a fair point, but if you want to rail on prot paladin talents, do so on redoubt and reckoning, which require to get crit to  trigger, which is something a tank usually wants to avoid. Paladins honestly have their niche in vanilla tanking more so than druids. A druid is mostly simply a worse warrior tank. A paladin is excellent at handling aoe packs of enemies, but can't really tank bosses. Also mana is a big issue.
---
If you get on retail right now, do you feel there are any differences between the classes? any particular strengths or weaknesses?
---
&gt; Method is also min-maxing to the extreme and playing at a completely different level than 99.5% of the player base.
---
So? The hardcore guilds minmaxed just as heavily back then and despite classes being much more homogenous now, we've never seen raid compositions like this, where nearly all dds are one spec. At least, I've never seen a vanilla raid, which brought the equivalent of 18 dps warriors or mages to a first kill. 
---
&gt; Their dps is going to be less by design than other "pure" dps classes. It's an argument for bringing that 8th mage or fury warrior.
---
An 8th mage or warrior, you cannot gear, because need their stuff. A hybrid dps class will get the gear though and keep up with an undergeared pure dps class. Besides losing 100-300dps, depending on where you are isn't such a massive loss. It's also completely false, that those specs don't bring anything for the raid. A druid brings another battlerezz and innervate as well as a 3% crit aura. A shadow priest brings a shadow dmg buff. A ret paladin brings judgment of wisdom/light (can be technically done by holy, but is a hassle for them), an extra blessing (which is always helpful, there are a total of 6 longterm blessings, of which all classes can make use of at least 5. Not to mention the short term blessings, which are always a great cooldown to have). I don't think many guilds will bring 5 holy paladins to handle all the blessings themselves.
---
Yeah that's fair enough, seems about right from a pure support. You're relying on the ones you're supporting :P
---
Would you say that shockadin is perhaps safer? That way you can heal for the most part but not be 100% useless if nobody in the pug protects you?
---
Oh man I listened to so much Stabbing the Drama while leveling in vanilla
---
Also, you can't post bugs on the forums until you're level 10, but I found 3 bugs in the launcher after I downloaded the client.
---
So, I guess I'll file those when the game launches tomorrow.
---
I think that’s a fair point. Even if you’re looking for a community in retail it can feel pretty isolated. I vividly remember that feeling of making friends as you ran a dungeon and the like. I may have underestimated this part of it. Do you think it will be less community though, as people have a more defined route of what they want and how to accomplish it? I.E.
---
I dont think people understands how useless it is to post about layering every day.
---
Damn, you travelled really far into the future there.
---
I'd be highly surprised if anyone was going to struggle with Classic these days given how powerful even things like APUs have become.
---
It’s over bros. Pack it up, we’re not going home. /s
---
You heard correctly, though it’s not always easy to keep your pet alive. There’s a reason why 20/31/0 (and its variations) is *the* raiding spec, and it’s that pet damage is always relevant, and is a massive part of your damage output early on. 
---
Oh and pets are doing more damage in Classic than on pservers, without even taking into account armor values.
---
At that level, almost 20g is fantastic. If you don't farm, you probably won't get a mount at 40 and you probably won't get 100% mount for a while.
---
I can second this. I started in 2006 and my first max lrvel character was in WotLK. So I played Vanilla and TBC without hitting max level. Game was just so enjoyable back then and I was huge altoholic.
---
&gt;any foreman with half a brain doesn’t need to look at ’em. One day this year or maybe the next you’re gonna be somewhere else, so enjoy yourself now.
---
If His understanding of building is as good as life,, then you should ignore this.
---
I’m playing hardcore again and my group includes a bunch of first time WoWers. They’re spending as much time as me watching streamers and preparation videos etc 😁
---
From memory; Cleanse, Hand of Freedom and FoL go a long way in PVP
---
^This, I raided facing the ground and despite that I still couldn't see the fire!
---
Thanks :) yeah that does seem good. The same build for healing your teammates in PvP can still heal them in pve
---
Pariah by Naglfar was my go to pvp album
---
Parses of 65 seconds with all cooldown blown including recklessness with world buffs up is hardly a good representation of how warriors do. Cherry picked "top" on aoe fights.
---
Maybe get a average of all the bosses would be a better without world buffs.
---
#HOOBASTANK
---
No I haven’t really researched it. That’s part of why I posted this, I wanted to hear what everyone else was thinking. So what do you think is the primary difference between why classic will secured and why retail is flopping?
---
To me it's a greater evil than Clusters would be. If we had a static population to play amongst, whatever was happening would always be present. With layering we will have little sense of consistent population around us. Because we will be playing on megaservers amongst different people every day I expect that it will feel like sharding. 
---
Give me the Vanilla experience with early merges over sharding every day.
---
Can't agree more, both Legion and WoD I dropped in weeks before the next expansion to do the final raid tiers in the starting gear and breezed them both. That ain't right.
---
*wall of text crits you for 3211 damage*
---
I actually liked inscription, achievements, increased debuff limit for my afliction lock, 25 man raids, and the gear that could be reused on alts for leveling, dual talent specs, tokens for gear instead of just drops.
---
We once sent our DnD rogue in to scout a bandit hideout. He tripped on the threshold and knocked himself out on a table, alerting everyone in the hideout... Apparently stealth isn't conducive to solo play either.
---
Well that’s encouraging to hear! It’s probably mad exciting for them to both have some serious veterans, but also be new to the scene. I envy them.
---
There were plenty of kids playing it in 2005 that weren't turned off by the lack of instant gratification.
---
Ret Paladin in wrath was the most fun I've had.
---
I don’t think the end-game is the consuming point.
---
It’s like I eight 1/3 of a fantastic Christmas roast - and then got too full.
---
Afaik BM is good if you’re early raiding without pre-raid gear, as pet damage is an even bigger portion of your damage since you have worse gear. I’ve heard it still be decent when you’re getting better gear, but I really doubt it can compete once you’ve got mostly T1 gear.
---
Righteousness and Command scale with SP:
---
* SoR gets 10% on a 1-hander and 12.% on a 2-hander.
---
* JoR gets 50%
---
* SoC gets 20% (29% of +holy)
---
* JoC gets 43%
---
True, but you are also kinda making the point the op was making. The journey to the end game content was way longer and more important, and for many people (especially the older folks without massive amounts of time) it will be the majority of their play time, maybe they won't even reach the end. So purely focusing on raids is a bad idea for most people that don't belong in the speed running category (and those who do, already know all there is to know).
---
Classic only. I played for a month or two in Legion but haven't played consistently since WotLK. One of my friends is the exact same. I have a friend that quit in TBC and a friend that quit in WotLK and we're getting the band back together for classic.
---
I remember having the same problem, in our first Molten Core run, my old laptop turned into a slideshow. I think it must have been only 1-2fps max. My girlfriend on the other hand had a slightly better performance with 4-5fps, which was still playable in my memory. Good old times. Looking forward to it again, even if i won't have the time to spend so many hours again. Maybe i'll get my son to play it with me some day.
---
It's a natural fit. Both communities are fed up with awful storytelling and want to go back to classic/season 1 when the material was well written and the creators had a passion for doing it.
---
*Crushing*
---
Sounds like an STI waiting to happen if you did screw directly have shaving.
---
THAT riff, you know the one.
---
Subscription guarantees stress test invites
---
./ignore playername ez fix to that problem
---
I actually believe that playing music in the background while playing killed the game for me in wotlk. In Vanilla and TBC levelling was such an intense expetience because of the ambience music. In pvp and cities it was alright, but while levelling... nah. That's what I did wrong in wotlk. Now everytime I listen to We Came As Romans I'm standing in Dalaran doing nothing but jumping into the well.
---
It was also a different time back then and games in 2005 weren't all about "HERE'S SOME SKINS, HAVE SOME LOOTBOXES OMGGGGG PURPLE TITANFORGED SOCKETED BIG TITTY GEAR!!!!!"
---
Part of them beeing op is paly giving them hand of freedom with tons of other buffs from spells nd shit so u cant purge it. So u have op dk or warri stomping your face poppin theire immunes  while u have paly sitting there in bubble... ive played thousends of arena games during wotlk 2k+..
---
Boosters aren't even the biggest threat. The return of chinese gold farmers/sellers are the most unacknowledged issue.
---
People *will* purchase gold from third-party sellers in Classic. Period. Chinese gold farmers will exploit that to commit crimes against the community. Period. To say and think otherwise is irresponsible and delusional. That's just the world we live in. 
---
Blizzard and every other company on earth naively thought they could fight it by “just say no” campaigns, or account banning (plenty of evidence this has little effect) and other regulatory means. But history shows all of that didn't work and will never work. 
---
This is like saying that prohibition or abstinence-only education is the only sensible way of curbing alcoholism / teen pregnancy. That's literally what every argument in this thread boils down to.
---
Any conversation that starts with that assumption is not a fact-based conversation.
---
**The only (counter-intuitive for most people) solution to the problem is to offer a safe, legitimate source of RMT.**
---
My concern is that everyone here is naively letting Blizzard off the hook for something they begrudgingly had to do to solve [the multi-million dollar gold farming industry that existed for most of WoW life.](https://venturebeat.com/2011/07/22/the-china-conundrum-the-rise-of-gold-farming/)
---
I know this slipped under most current players' radar, but this was a huge problem. It affected the game much more than it seems anyone in this thread wants to admit and—ironically—the anti-Blizzard blinders are actually causing ya'll to let Blizzard slide on this. Not offering a legitimate way to RMT in 2018 is like [a company bringing out a 100% replica of a Model-A Ford without any seat belts](http://www.mafca.com/seat_belts.html) and trying to legitimately sell this to consumers. And a crowd of idiots defending the decision because muh nostaliga.
---
Knowing what we know now about how to render the gold farming and hacking industry to a whisper of what it used to be, it would be the height of irresponsibility to purposely choose not implementing a legitimate form of RMT just for nostalgia sakes.
---
It has never happened before that an old version of an MMORPG is brought back a decade and a half later. Retro re-releases happen, but to bring back an MMO is unheard of. This is the first time. I think players don't understand the ramifications and are only thinking of this as every other re-release of a “classic game.”
---
We know better about how to manage communities in 2018. The effective ways of battling gold farming have to be brought in (just how all the other security measures built into retail's client are going to be implemented as well.)
---
To not do so is irresponsible on part of the company and players who let this slide because muh nostalgia are complicit in bringing back a criminal, multi-million dollar, exploitative industry.
---
Yeah. My mindset exactly. Bring 1-3 chars to 60 in the early phases when loot is scarce and then do the t0.5 quests :)
---
there are too many of them to ignore.. i mean, in BFA rn.
---
I mean the Inn names in WoW are pretty cool.  
---
The Golden Keg  
---
Gallow's End  
---
Stonefire  
---
Caregiver 
---
Lion's Pride  
---
Scarlet Raven  
---
Thunderbrew  
---
Farstrider  
---
The Broken Tusk  
---
etc..
---
That’s because games hadn’t conditioned them for instant gratification like they do nowadays
---
It'll be different, but it'll still be good. People were a lot more chill and mature in 2005. 14 years later, people can't take a joke and can't handle any difference of opinion and will be a lot more confrontational. I think as classic goes on, it'll weed out the idiots.
---
Selling raid loot was a thing in Vanilla and it will return in Classic.
---
it is sick leave from me starting on the 27th  :P
---
Man I remember Grim's pvp videos... Linkin Park, Dragonforce, Bad Boys
---
Thank you a lot for your positive reply :) appreciated. I try my best.
---
Nugg Nugg
---
I feel the same. Really haven't been very excited about early Classic 
---
 this last month. I've dealt with layering-like systems in other MMORPGs and had hoped never to see it again and here it comes for the recreation of Vanilla. I expect a significant hindrance on the leveling experience and that was so important to get right.
---
My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.
---
They just released a new album aswell as if they knew we are in need for new soundtrack to classic lol
---
Barrens Chat will get them sorted before level 20.
---
Wasn't BRD quite good?
---
Most kids in my high school were permanently level 15-40, it seemed. They were freaking out about how OP  they were once they got Kidney Shot/Aim Shot.
---
Please create a spotify list
---
Not saying it will get made but Blizzard literally told us that that's a possibility.
---
u are right mate, they are the superior threat to the whole community, and it is said that ppl find business in a fun game also...
---
disappointed\*
---
Oh god. Just don’t become addicted and fail school.
---
Thanks for backing up my thesis. The link below looks like you are right. Warlock still being some of the the lowest as alliance atleast. But it looks so even that it should not matter.
---
This thread is giving me nostalgic goosebumps
---
Thankyou for that reply, thats the information i was looking for, so 120hz seems to be the cap on Private servers, ill test beta tommorow to see if 240 works and get back to you
---
Powerwolf, Gloryhammer, Manowar, Sabaton for raiding
---
InExtremo, VanCanto, Ancient Guardian for chilling
---
InFlames, Amaranthe, Amon Amarth for Pvp
---
So does that mean that Atiesh is ok because its a lore characters weapon or is it disqualified because it's an obtainable item?
---
I just need to know which of your arbitrary rules takes priority.
---
"SodaPoppins safespace" (Alt-Pvp)
---
Barrens chat will see a lot of people banned/suspended because people can't handle chat like that nowadays.
---
&gt;wow had 3-4 million players thats like 0.003%
---
not that it matters but thats actually 0.025%
---
also peak subscriber numbers in vanilla were just shy of about 8 million people, making it 0.0125%

BadBoy addon with your filter. Silence them fir yourself and done.

They haven’t said how many realms they’re going to have or what their names are. This is just a copy of the current realm list. I stated this thread just to spark some creativity and discussion that’s all. Really interested in what people could come up with. Most of it was genitalia related tho.
---
Yep, was just gonna post the exact same comment.  
---
I don't think the conspiracy theory is correct, but in time I think the two communities will diverge from one another. Especially if Blizzard ever makes "Classic+" content (basically new stuff for Classic).
---
Not vanilla but I remember watching my friends older brother raid in wrath at 9fps and it absolutely blew me away. Probably would have never bothered to play the game if I hadn't seen that
---
Dude I agree completely!
---
Really cant choose between Tauren and Orc.... (shaman)
---
Orc seems mostly better but man I want a stun
---
Some interesting reads on the topic:
---
Lets read an actual interview with a Chinese gold-farmer circa 2015, around the release of the WoW Token. 
---
[World of Warcraft and the battle against black market gold: Is the WOW Token working?](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-29-world-of-warcraft-and-the-battle-against-black-market-gold)
---
&gt; The gold-sellers are putting a brave face on it. After days of unanswered emails, I eventually get to speak to someone from SSE-Games in China - after I convince him I don't work for Blizzard, that is. Alex (probably not his real name), acknowledges that the Token has had "lots of effect on business" and that SSE will earn less money now. This is a company of around 60 people and WOW accounts for half of its business. It's not even one of the bigger companies in China, where he believes most of the gold-selling business to be located. "There are hundreds or thousands of companies like us," he says.
---
Whether you like it or not, the WoW Token has been one of the most effective solutions [to reduce the size and power of the black market gold-farming industry.](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2228-im-paid-to-play-mmorpgs-its-nightmare-5-realities.html) This is from another interview with a gold farmer in 2016:
---
&gt; “Jeremy thinks he has only a few years left in his job, and here's the big reason:
---
&gt;[Image of WoW Token]
---
&gt; If you're a player looking to buy your way to better gear in WOW, you can buy a $20 token that can then be traded in an in-game auction house for gold. The purchaser of the token can't redeem it for cash—they can use it only toward free months of their game subscription (to prevent farming).
---
&gt; Jeremy says the decision caused a panic among the gold farming community. And although the demand for black market gold still exists, Jeremy has seen his income fall, despite putting more hours in this year than last.”
---
Remember what Stephen Winson wrote? 
---
&gt; “by effectively legalizing and regulating the gold trade, they reduce their costs spent enforcing the ban against third party gold sellers, and the cost of cleaning up the accounts of people who bought gold from shady dealers.”
---
It's a sentiment also echoed by Ion Hazzikostas himself (so much for not having “insider information from Blizzard”):
---
&gt; “One of the common myths is that somehow Blizzard benefits from the existence from people who are botting instances or selling gold - the traditional gold farmers - because we're getting subscription money. No, we're not. Those accounts are almost all fraudulent.
---
&gt; Actually we're doubly losing money from them because they're stealing people's credit cards to reactivate an account, to boost an account, farming on it until it gets banned - as soon as we detect the credit card is stolen. We often get charge-back fees from the credit card companies because of the cancelled charge.”
---
Unfortunately, Blizzard didn't always take this stance, much like Stephen Winson explained in his blog. In [this New York Times article from 2007](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17lootfarmers-t.html), it's pointed out how Blizzard found themselves scrambling for a solution without punishing paying customers:
---
&gt; “Like the majority of M.M.O. companies, Blizzard has chosen to align itself with the customers who abhor R.M.T. rather than the ones who use it. A year ago, Blizzard announced it had identified and banned more than 50,000 World of Warcraft accounts belonging to farmers.
---
&gt; Of course, nobody expected the farmers’ equally rule-breaking customers to be punished too. Among players, the R.M.T. debate may revolve around questions of fairness, but among game companies, the only question seems to be what is good for business. Cracking down on R.M.T. buyers makes poorer marketing sense than cracking down on sellers, in much the same way that cracking down on illegal drug suppliers is a better political move than cracking down on users. 
---
Interestingly, the article mentions the following:
---
&gt; “Only a few companies have found a way to make R.M.T. part of their business model. Sony Online Entertainment, which publishes EverQuest, has started earning respectable revenues from an experimental in-game auction system that charges players a small transaction fee for real-money trades.”
---
The seeds of a solution!
---
The WoW Token has been a resounding success is ending the exploitative, harmful, Chinese black market gold farming cabals. It will 100% negatively impact Classic, but this is ultimately an ethical argument, not a gameplay one.
---
Hi, /u/lolyssian
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2dxp1/update_your_battlenet_launcher_you_too_probably/). 
---
The server cost in minimum they have even mentioned this. Also it wouldn’t be a few. If they are layering servers to artificially raise server pop caps they would have to have 2-3x the amount servers maybe more.
---
So say they have 10 servers with 3 layers of each continent with 2k per layer. 120k people. Now to increase servers to match they would need 30 servers. What happens when 40% of the pop leaves? You then have ~12 dead servers.
---
As a younger player myself I would say that young people can be interested in this game. I have had multiple friends that I told about classic and they are all excited to play it.  A lot of people my age used to play those shitty demos with the level cap being 20 in MoP.
---
This is absolutely beautiful, are you a poet? Anyway me and my 16 year old self will happily help you egg your 16 year old self and run away real quickly, lets face it he would probly beat all 3 of us.

Dude, the S2 healing mace was better than anything in T4 and was good enough to finish T5 with. It took me like 3 weeks of losing arenas on my shaman to get it. How much more welfare can it get?
---
Good luck playing while standing in a crowded train for two hours on a laptop!
---
I dont know if it'll appeal to a younger crowd. The time investment required to reach endgame and play the game properly is not something that the younger generation are use to these days. All the games popular with younger people allow you to jump in and jump out.   
---
When WoW originally launched, it was a great MMO and we didn't have as much choice. I could be wrong though, I guess we'll see.
---
Neither you waste the same time in game to clear content, rank, farm consumables and so on, which in turn gives you a lot more time to do whatever the fuck you want and have fun, in game or outside the game. 
---
I have been on both sides and i rather be in a hardcore guild or tryhard guild (whatever they mean by tryhard) than a casual guild. It's funny, people have the wrong idea, casual guilds are actually more time consuming, more gold consuming, it will deplete your farming and it will exhaust your patience and enjoyment of the game. 
---
But if people enjoy being in groups where each individual does whatever the fuck he wants and then waste 5 hours each time in MC wiping to trash and waste a week to clear only two bosses, go for it.
---
Just understand that you are idd free to spec and do whatever you want, but that has consequences in vanilla that you do not see in retail, so don't get mad afterwards if you are not making progress with your character both in pve and pvp.
---
FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR

Thrice, poison the well, from autumn to ashes, coheed and Cambria, and Thursday.

Can you guide me to this post my good fellow?

haha yeah true truth :D

If you read the post that was sort of the pt.
---
Apart from that, race order is Human-Dwarf-NE-Gnome and Orc-Undead-Tauren-Troll
---
I really hope the community is as good as it was at initial release, that is what I'm most excited about. I'm not in the beta and have almost had my fill of streamers....just let me play the game! :D
---
So i went to log in today and i saw a version select and it let me switch to classic. Although i see people playing on stream every server says offline? Do i actually have access or?
---
I agree with this but this doesn't just affect kids, it affects adults just as badly if not worse as they are the ones actually putting down the credit card for this stuff.
---
Do you have an active subscription? Then yes, in ~14 hours you’ll be able to play for 48 hours with a level cap of 15. Otherwise, no.
---
Your warrior friend needs to generate threat on all the targets. Pay attention to what you are getting agro on. Is it the primary target or the secondary target.
---
If the tank does not build threat on the other targets, you will pull them after just a few heals.  You may be better off wanding or attacking the primary mob so it dies faster, then heal up the tank when he needs it.
---
Wearing t1 in 2009?

On this reddit you either milk the WE HATE MINMAX crowd, or RESTORED LVL 60 CHARACTER crowd, or LOOK AT MY SETUP crowd
---
I think you're wrong about this being the first time an MMO has been revived. (See: EverQuest)  
---
I'm on board with RMT, though.
---
Nah, I'm good.  Faxmonkey taught me the way of the mage back then.  All dance music, all day.
---
It may limit the chance of running into people again but it won’t be like on retail where there is next to 0 chance you see them again.
---
The pool on retail is far larger than the pool on your server will be. Regardless of layer you’ll still be on the same realm. You can still friend everyone and group with them that way. Chances are you will still see the same people quite often. Especially if chats aren’t later specific but realm specific which they kinda seem to be.
---
Which is why 1 druid and priest are designated for hots.
---
That test was announced to be for US only, i have active EU sub and im in same situation as OP
---
There were no rating reqs at all until S3. S2 gear was T5 ilvl equivalent.
---
When was EverQuest re-released?
---
No Nightwish?
---
Nightwish was literally in every tutorial / farm / how-to / raid montage video.
---
Tarja (Lead singer at the time) has a new album dropping in 3 days after Classic's launch. Gonna be just like in the ol' days.
---
Thanks :)
---
I never said otherwise...
---
I agree gaming was far better for the consumer back then I just believe that adults are the main ones allowing this to continue. I have met guys who when they buy Fifa they will then spend almost 1000 dollars on loot boxes to get the team that they want and they do this every year when a new version comes out.
---
These are guys who are in their 40's
---
Layers don’t exist unless the population warrants it. It’s not like phasing. Layers are created as the population swells and removed as it shrinks. 
---
The whole sky is falling bullshit about being able to exploit resources or jump layers at will is ridiculous.
---
No u
---
And its a banger album too!
---
Catch me on the Cracked Sash server.

Wait....
---
I got the S2 healing mace by losing for 3 weeks on my shaman alt and heard the complaints live over Vent during T5 progression.

Layering is *continent* wide, not zone wide. I wish you people would educate yourselves on how this actually works before you start with the handwringing.
---
Also totem twisting requires real commitment and it's one of the only reason a enhancement shaman can shine besides Nightfall procs.
---
Great post. It's less about having a debate with someone about what parts of a video game you should enjoy, and more so explaining the reality of what kind of game classic is, and understanding how much of your time will be spent at certain points in the game.
---
The issue with having the chest-unlocking npcs in the zones is that other players can camp them. You could just camp the npcs and kill players trying to unlock chests there. 
---
Having a system where you need to accrue a lot of a currency in order to buy special items could work too. Especially if players run the risk of dying and losing it all. You have to gamble whether to keep farming once you reach 10 or try to get to 20.
---
It’s because there’s an open Stress Test in ~14 hours for all US and Oceanic players with an active subscription. Has nothing to do with launch day.
---
Your weapon damage will be somewhere between nil and buttkiss. It couldn't matter any less.   
---
As another poster said, use weapon oils if you're feeling tryhard.

Venruki's PVP playlist has most of the classics and Drakedog probably has the rest.

You are all forgetting that this is also a *TEMPORARY* measure. It will be gone before it can even make a difference.

Is downranking hots a thing?
---
Adding ranked arenas to a game that wasn't even designed with PvP balance in mind completely fucked class/gear balancing. They basically had to try to balance for two completely different games at the same time and the lead devs who oversaw the addition of arenas stated publicly that it was the single worst mistake they ever made with the game.
---
Tell it to 150,000 active accounts made on Nostalrius pserver, who were playing classic for years straight
---
Not just the time investment but the social investment of having a core group of friends and a guild of 40+ people to raid consistently. Over the past 15 years things like automatic matchmaking and the death of dedicated servers have made multiplayer groups throwaway experiences. I think we may see a lot of younger folks try to solo their way through the game and have worse experiences for it.
---
I don’t buy this at all. Some of the best selling games in the last decade have been RPGs with crazy long playtimes.
---
except for the Linkin PArk, i agree :D ! \\m/

TDP could be misleading. GPU clocks and CPU boost clocks and boost algirithm are what matters. Mobile chips can be forced into a TDP scenario, but if not on battery power and with thermal headroom - they can exceed the TDP.
---
Calm down macho boi

Nice work! Ty!!
---
Apologies! I'm still somewhat new to this! Will see what I can do about this in the next one
---
I think as a warrior you will definitely want macros for swapping stances, so you don't have to click them. Other than that I think decent key binds should do you for the most part. And people will start posting lots of macros once it goes live, or even during beta. I would suggest not starting with too many though, or it could get confusing pretty quickly.
---
The biggest issue is all the posts about it!
---
EQ started in 1999. About 12 years later, they launched their first "progression" server. (These servers unlock new expansions ~2 months after the final boss of the current expansion is killed.)

You are correct, it can be important. But it is only part of the game, and for many peoplea part of the game, they may never experience anyways (especially those that are more casual and have no idea about the game so far). However the focus in this subreddit seems to be almost entirely about min maxing at a level that will be irrelevant for many.
---
&gt;Furthermore it is not the latest Unreal4 engine tech demo.
---
Minecraft is the best selling game of all time

I never raided, still enjoyed
---
Hehe, I remember one friend asking me to play the fight with his rogue at majordomo executus because his PC couldn't handle it. He just told me to target the mobs and press 2-2-3 , 2-2-2-4. Funny times when I had no idea what rogues were about back then (was playing a mage and I was hardly lvl 40)
---
It kinda does. The way they have it set up now is in prep for launch day. The way the drop down menus works is how it will work on launch day. The stress test log in is listed under Live (like it will on launch) not development like the last ones were.
---
Outside of that it has nothing to do with launch.
---
Theres a short compressed video on the channel detailing the 1-12 run. Where to go and what to do. Its specific to Druids as in it builds up to the most efficient bear form run, but the major part is the same when youre running a sham!

Ive mained Mage for so long that I don't want to anymore. I also exclusively played horde. IDK what to play... Maybe hunter... nah the pet learning, feeding process... but feint death take You out of combat and You can swap trinkets for PvP... But I get rekt by warriors and mages too much... Maybe Warrior... Nah mages... but Gnome warrior can escape artist out of nova... but I cannot lvl as alliance, I only know how to find Mankirks wife... Rogue? But I said some time ago that I would like to heal I think this time... healer = priest, druid, shaman (or pally if ill play alliance). Pally sounds pretty cool tbh... but the playstyle is just spamming lvl 1 fast heal... hmm I think Ill go shaman. Orc is cool. Racial for enchancement, stun ressist, nice animations, hmmm Hybrid 30/0/21 build sounds nice. This fucking never ends...
---
True! If I have the patience... might make which of the two i prefer obvious to myself though
---
Havent done Durotar once on the beta. Will be a while before i get that one down as fast as Mulgore. Will be working on it though!
---
I disagree for a simple reason. I started playing on a private server recently because of classic wow and im enjoying every second of it  ib fact im enjoying it more than back in the day because i know what the fuck im soing. Sure wow was magical the first time around but personally i enjoy it more when i know how to actually play it.
---
R3 2200g is mode 4 on 3440x1440. That's a medium quality settings. On 1080p it would allow more. To get mode 7 on 3440x1440 the minimum seems RX460/560 level of GPU - got around 60 fps. So depending on resolution and target quality it's either that APU or second hand cheap dGPU. RX570/470 are super value right now while other Polaris and Pascal cards are also on the table.
---
No one on this subreddit takes screenshots.
---
Do you need BFA or just an active subscription?
---
So i do have an active US sub. But i am currently living in japan. Should i download a VPN? Also i just got this and never got an email im able to start it and everything but i get to realm select and it says their offline. Is there a wait time and also you said i could level to 15 and play for 48 hours but i havent heard anything about that i heard it was 40 and you could play so long as their running a beta
---
There are benefits to playing a human but everytime I see one I can't help but to think they must be the most boring, straight edge, copy paste person irl.
---
You're eirht. Posts like yours come up 10x a day but no one understands the issues /s
---
??? People are already exploiting resources with layer jumping.

I thought that this is lvl3 quest Lazy Peons :D

---
Typical, haha.
---
Only classic. They would have to completely rehaul retail for me to play that shit.
---
Zoomers won't like Classic sadly
---
Too bad you can only ignore 50 people in Classic...unless they remove the limitation it is completely pointless.
---
100% this. Plus, outside of raiding (i.e. most of the game) off-specs are great and sought after for leveling and 5 mans. Hybrid DPS is only lower in raids due to scaling and itemization, you won't notice any difference in 5 mans and they bring a ton of the table. Hell, I'd take a Moonkin, Enhance Shaman, Ret Pally etc over a Rogue or Fury War DPS in my 5 man any day... give me those sweet buffs and utility!
---
Whilst this is true, those games don't have a persistent world moving around them even when they're offline.
---
Being that it came out just a couple months prior to TBC, I'd have to disagree ... then again, so did patch 1.12 and it's literally Classic WoW.
---
I have a 7 year old i3 processor, 8gb ram, ssd. 
---
I recently added a RX570 graphics card (roughly equivalent to a GTX1060)....I feel like that may have been overkill.
---
230days played later...
---
I think it's the opposite. People still love RPGs, they've always loved RPGs. WoW is a game for people with a lot of time on their hands, something young people often do.
---
What a shitty bait stress test lol, US only lmao. So if you want it fromt he EU prepare for shit latency.
---
Nah it’s on the top left ;)
---
I feel old
---
Is there a way to look stuff like this up ... would be interested in going back to see server rankings for guilds I was in during vanilla/TBC.
---
Three days grace
---
Fort minor
---
I doubt dungeon boosts will be a thing, maybe BGs and most definitely raids.
---
EU here too. I still can't install classic.
---
me and my friend will do a priest warrior duo too, me being the priest
---
One thing I have not seen in the replies here yet is that you'd actually want aggro while questing and NOT the warrior.  
---
Look at it this way: if the warrior has aggro, the warrior takes damage and you need to heal  
---
If you have aggro, you can kite the mobs while both of you kill them and no one takes damage
---
Don’t play a warrior if you’re a noob lmao
---
But then who will make the other guys look good?
---
I freed up some time in my schedule about 9 days for that initial push at release. Slowly doing lots of work at home to  appease the godess of "why do you play that game" &amp; "you're 40+ years of age and still a child".  
---
Ive been planning a surprise weekend if everything else fails.
---
The issue is making sure servers aren't crashing at launch. Merging servers wouldn't do anything to fix that. The whole point is to make smaller, more manageable "layers" so Blizzard's servers can handle the influx of millions and millions of players at launch. By the end of phase one, some players who tried out the game will have quit, and blizzard will have more info they can use to effectively manage servers without the use of layering.
---
THIS RIGHT HERE
---
Troll Druid is pretty awesome, yeah :)
---
People posted about wanting Classic servers every day too (for years) and look what happened. So, what's your point?
---
To be honest your chance of playing main tank in a raid are about as high as playing the feral tank/off tank.
---
And sure, don't ignore it, but also don't focus just on the raiding aspect of the game, especially if you don't want to no life it. It is only part of the game.
---
You absolutely don't need to and shouldn't do this.
---
To tank, the most important thing is to train a ranged weapon and pull isolated mobs and mobs that patrol away from their friends. In the early dungeons, as long as you can break up the spawns, and wear decent mail armor, you can beat every fight.
---
On private servers everyone uses frostbrand because it does the most damage and slows them down. It actually procs a lot and I’ve had it crit for 600 damage.
---
I wonder if people theorized back then that the portal would be reopened for the expansion.
---
&gt;If I told you a new game as coming out that took 350 hours to beat, why would it make sense to focus all of your attention on hours 200-350?
---
To be fair, thats not accurate in terms of scale. It takes like like 7-12 days for most people to reach 60. Its not uncommon for people to have like 100 days /played or some shit on their main.
---
So its like saying why are you focusing all your attention on hours 40-350? The journey is fun, and its important. But level 60 is where most of your time gets spent. People want to have spent their time wisely I guess and not regret their class choice  after getting to 60.
---
shield and 1hander is a must. Usually from what I see people use windfury, but it's no biggie.
---
I don't think YOU realize how dead the servers will be without layering. 
---
With an authentic concurrency cap of roughly 3000 people you can bet your ass that a big portion of those will be retail players who's just trying out the game and a big portion of them will decide that the game isn't for them and will quit.
---
After a few weeks or months the server you rolled on which had queues to get into will be down to 500 players online during peak hours.
---
Yes layering sucks but it's absolutely crucial for the long term health of the servers.
---
Are you in eu couse from what I've heard we are not included
---
You should see spriest vs warrior. Wars don’t get rage until they break shield and weakened soul isn’t a long debuff
---
God, Waking the Fallen was a killer album. I remember killing bats and blasting it on repeat
---
&gt; Give me the Vanilla experience with early merges instead of sharding.
---
And force millions of people into changing the names of their characters because it's taken on the new realm? That would be a PR nightmare for Blizzard.
---
It is. It is just that this sub reddit seems to be dominated by it and min/maxing. It sometimes feels like someone asking what bike to get to commute 2 times a week and getting answers from pros how you optimise if you plan to win the tour de france.

You don't need to spec prot to tank dungeons while leveling, you can do it in any of the other specs, obviously though you should try and put aside any good tanking gear you come upon while leveling so you can switch to that while tanking dungeons.
---
Over 10 years later yet Gunslinger, Almost Easy, and Critical Acclaim still slap. Gotta get into the mood to hunt out some Alliance dogs.
---
It's been decided! I've seen an awesome video of a shadow priest melting faces in pvp! ... Or maybe I'll go shaman?
---
I can get behind the human hate, but only if it means we lump undead in there, as well. They're just humans that sucked too much to keep living and don't understand what to do with their hands when they dance.
---
WoW classic mobs have far less chance to dodge/parry your attacks than private servers.
---
This is a big reason you're seeing faster 1-10 times than ever before.
---
I'll always bet on an average mage facing an above average warrior.
---
Keyword here is 'invent'.
---
Yeah that shows classic data, aka the current beta, thats why I asked if someone can get some from vanilla. 
---
“Added in patch 1.13.0.28211”
---
Idk man I think people in this debate forget that these are just video games and not real life. Some people like us want to adventure a world and some people want to dress up their character in skins and hop into a world and shoot people right away. It doesnt mean you are some dumb kid who needs instant gratification because you think CoD is more fun than WoW. And the nerds who say it is certainly arent more mature when they spend 20-30 hours a week playing this game acting like its hardcore lmao
---
In Flames - Crawling Through Knives has to be in any Vanilla video
---
And most importantly it's more fun to play with friends. I rather level 20% slower with friends than power level alone.
---
So if only a few people do it we should completely ignore it? wow.... This is why exploits catch on over time lmao.
---
Then the Rammstein keyboard comes in. Nobody makes pvp videos that hype anymore.
---
&gt; One of the things I love about the original levelling experience is the friendship you strike up with people along the way. Sure the starting zones are a mess but you hit the 20+ zones and you see some folks on a quest and join up briefly.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Later at level 30something you see them again and catch up. This time you chat more and maybe add them as a friend.
---
&gt; Later at level 40something you quest with them purposefully and run a dungeon.
---
And that will still happen. You won't be thrown from one layer to the next willy nilly, they'll try to stick you to YOUR layer every time you log in.
---
No idea why this is downvoted. The boss of the original stockades is absolutely not Hogger.
---
I spent my whole childhood playing wow as a kid, and by the time BC came out, i only reached level 44 as a warlock; which is considered  one of the easiest leveling classes.Since wrath ive been a huntard devoted to the bow, and this will not be changing with classics release! I get that hunters arent amazing for later tier raids and only 3 are required, but thats looking so far ahead that im just going to focus on the now, have a fun time leveling raiding PVP'ing getting rhok delar and then some. If people start saying no to me joining raids as soon as MC ends i would be shocked.
---
TLDR: Pick what you love!!!
---
Stop with the bullshit though, in current wow, you can play any class and specialisation and be fine with it unless you really aim the very top, be it PvE or PvP
---
Didn't care much for main raid chat.  All about those class-specific channels/chat where you talk about gear and why X or Y class sucks and your class should get drops over them.
---
That will definitely happen if the population keeps growing and all the other servers are full. That's what happened in 2005.
---
It was VC in Gorgonnash, alliance at least
---
&gt;Everyone calm down.

If people want to calm down, let them.

---
You don't need to be prot until endgame content. Prior to that, dungeons are designed to be run by people leveling, which means specs not optimized for group content.
---
Whoa!
---
I don't think I could gank a lowbie. Sap and tease for sure but I couldn't be that much of an asshole.
---
I'm also in EU and I was able to download classic. Next to that the Classic Beta &amp; Stress test got added to my account a few days ago, but this has now changed to just Beta: Classis WoW so I wonder if, after the stress test, I can play the beta.
---
Male or female ne rogue? I need to judge your tastes
---
Classic is literally patch 1.13.
---
Vanilla never went past 1.12.1 (except up to 1.12.3 for some regions for localization fixes)
---
&gt; So if only a few people do it we should completely ignore it?
---
If the alternative is completely dead servers after a few weeks then yes.
---
They have 31 cover songs total
---
&gt;&gt; TL;DR: Many people won't ever even hit 60, so until then at least make sure you're having fun with the game.
---
&gt; This isn't a good argument. People like to have an end goal when playing a game. If that's your argument, then why would they play Classic at all? They could just play retail and enjoy a decent leveling experience (that scales even) with the ability to actually do endgame content at their own pace.
---
What? The great leveling experience and discovering the amazing world is one of the great draws of this game. Raids have gotten better with every expansion, the world and leveling has gotten worse to the point of absurdity.
---
If you just want to play raids, get retail, get a boost to max level and do that. You have vastly more challenging and engaging content and you get regular content patches. Raiding wasn't that great in vanilla, it just felt epic because you did it with 40 other people that you got to know from outside the raid.
---
Fuck man... my 2h40m sounds so bad now...
---
I personally don't think that diving into big API and its documentation is very good place to start progrmming.
---
Thanks a lot for your effort! Will you record also videos for gnomes starting area? Thanks!
---
I remember doing this on the Booty Boy boat.
---
Most of the 'gear score' obsessed min /maxers who never played vanilla won't get close to end game raiding in classic. 
---
Farming fire resist for dragons, nature resist gear for AQ and shadow protection potions for Naxx will likely baffle all but a minority.
---
On top of that the genuine 40 person coordination required for fights like twin emperors, c'thun, thaddius, hell even maexna, and that's before you get to 4h, sindragosa and skeletor.
---
What people forget is not the difficulty in getting people to learn the fights, but the combination of getting 40 people to reliably turn up enough to get geared up plus the increased liklihood of just 1 person from 40 fucking up and wiping the raid.
---
I'm massively looking forward to being a 5 man 'scrub' in my blue set and doing some casual pvp up to stone guard.

The most popular games amongst the younger generation are Fortnite and Minecraft. I cannot see classic wow competing for screen time against those two. It's a very different era now. There is a mountain of competition.

I usually draw the things I want to show others.

frostbrand with 1h and shield.
---
At lvl 40, 4 hours for the normal mount seems a fair price. At lvl 60 it should yield a lot more I guess. Especially that the AH should be goin hard by that time.

This is great!

Suggestion: search spotify for similar playlists, like the [old school venruki pvp](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0vlGlIvmvAg8ZTEXs2AcWV?si=T50eWp6HTEGFdJMZe08rRw) one. Just to catch anything you might be missing in a fairly easy manner.
---
Strange. Thanks for the update, will have to try
---
Is it true that I need to activate a month in order to do the stress test? Reee
---
Oh yes. And to make the reading a bit more interesting I will use the addon [Storyline](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24938-StorylineforClassic.html), which will add a pretty interface to dialogues.
---
My Paladin will be human bc dwarves are ugly AF. Also Elwynn is the best starting zone imo.
---
Not sure about other classes but as a hunter I used my PvE gear(parts of it) for PvP but not the other way around.  That being said we were way ahead of the curve for raiding content so it would probably be more of an issue for casual/semi-hardcore raiding guilds.  Usually for arenas I would only equip rings/trinkets/neck or whatever to boost my damage up a bit unless we were doing a bursty team in which case I went almost full PvE gear.  Battlegrounds were probably a good mix of 60%-70% PvE gear/30-40% PvP gear.  Tanky enough to survive but enough PvE gear to melt everyone.
---
I have my buddy film smoke signals of a 3rd party description and he plays it back on an 8mm projector of which I take pictures with my phone. Is there an easier way?
---
that sells for like a couple gold
---
When I roll warrior and am planning on tanking while leveling I start in arms get some points in tactical mastery so I can change stances and retain some rage then go fury. I like and prefer fury leveling so I do that.
---
Either way point is you don’t need to go prot and arms is definitely recommended to at least be able to retain some rage when changing stances.
---
Don't worry you're not the only one!
---
Me and my dad will be making a guild together like we did 13 years ago. He can play alot due to work at home, but i have university to attend to and will be casual from the week after launch.
---
We will be playing Ally on EU PvP server and will be recruiting casuals while leveling to be able to form a ''take it easy'' raid group for 1-2 times a week.
---
If you're interested just join the discord and we will let you know what server we will go to. 
---
Ooh btw! The guildname will be ''Back to Basic'' [https://discord.gg/kgHRxR](https://discord.gg/kgHRxR)
---
Faxmonkey put me on to so much good music
---
Unpopular opinion, but I loved leveling as a prot warr. I mainly did it so I could learn tanking skills in dungeons as I leveled but also to smash mobs in the face with a shield. 
---
If you’ve done tanking late game before or are in a rush then go arms - if you haven’t tanked previously be prepared to find a patient group early on whilst you learn the ropes - if you need a healer whilst you do mate send me a pm!
---
I’m never in a rush during dungeon runs and happy to help....as long as you’re horde 😎
---
But the current beta (1.13) uses the same values from 1.12? A.k.a the true vanilla data since blizzard has access to that from their old backup. Maybe they nerfed the droprate/price in a later patch and before 1.12 the diaries were more lucrative to farm?
---
Its been proven that Rogue Diary’s do not sell for 45 silver in classic.
---
But just incase you happen to make it to 60 and want to raid...Its good to know beforehand that you cant raid as feral/ret/sp. Atleast then you know what you get into and wont feel disappointed.
---
System of a Down used to be my go-to music on my twink
---
Hunters will always be in raids, as you need tranquilizing shot on many boss encounters, they are great at kiting gluth zombies and you can always use them to pull mobs.
---
Dwarves are the only alliance race I’d consider playing
---
That’s the definition of how it works. Layers won’t be created unless the population of a continent reaches a specific threshold. The general thought is that threshold is the typical Blizzlike cap, around 3k. Once the population dips below that threshold, the layers will be merged again and disappear.
---
I definitely remember waiting to loot the bucket of bolts in the dwarf starting area when I was fresh spawn back in 2006. Same goes for the necklace mud in the bottom of the lake in Redridge. It depends which spawn it is I guess, because there were a lot that were instant.
---
Same skill and same gear level warriors are a shit show in 1v1 vs pretty much every class. Can you still slaughter idiots with your higher skill and or better gear? Sure

We won't feel as old when we are all playing with people our own age lol

been playing on private servers for the last 4 years. already addicted lol.
---
Share video?
---
&gt; For feral druids this case gets really apparent: they do shit damage compared to dps classes, but don't really have that much utility for the raid either.
---
If a hybrid does less DPS than a pure DPS but doesnt bring enough utility, the solution is to add utility and here's why:
---
If players had the choice of rolling a rogue that could only melee DPS *or* rolling a rogue that could melee DPS but also respec to tank (with minimal gear changes) and to healer if needed... then there would be no point in rolling a DPS-only rogue, and there'd be little reason to bring them to raids. So then Bliz has to start giving more non-rogue features to the melee-only rogue to balance that out. And before long you have a mess of homogenized classes that have to have their utilities balanced equally since their DPS is balanced equally.
---
Alternately, we could make it so that bringing a feral to a raid is often more valuable than bringing a different melee without buffing the feral's individual DPS.
---
For example, imagine you have 5 rogues who do 500 DPS each and 1 feral who does 400 DPS... but brings a +10% buff for his group (doing 20% less damage personally but increasing others damage by 10%). The result would be 2500 DPS with a group of 5 rogues, 2600 DPS with 4 rogues + 1 feral, and a very reasonable 2450 DPS if you brought 3 rogues + 2 ferals.
---
I realize that Vanilla ferals are for more imbalanced than this. But my point is that it would be a bad idea to put their DPS on par with pure DPS classes when increased utility can increase demand for them without the utility equalization that becomes necessary with DPS equalization.
---
Same, played a tauren druid to level 10 on my dads account when I was 5
---
mg is about the same.  It just seemed lower on the beta because the streamers have bis due to fans and lvl cap.
---
I've got two characters in mind. Female Night Elf Hunter who I will be speeding through the leveling, leveling as efficiently and quickly as possible to stay ahead of the pack.
---
I've also got a planned female undead Warlock which will be parked in an inn for the majority of my hunters /played. I will spend a day and a half in the inn on my warlock, and then about 1-2 hours of gameplay on the warlock, casually completing quests or dungeons. Nothing rushed. The rested experience will still keep my leveling speed decent, even while leveling casually and exploring the game.
---
Hunter for min/max rushing through content to stay ahead of leveling pack
---
Warlock for leisurely stroll through World of Warcrafts content.

No internet until 2008?! We got internet back in 1995. I guess you never experienced anything other then broadband then? Sweet!
---
 I still remember how long it took to download a Warcraft 3 demo, paying money to our "internet jar" since internet cost per minute back then. Took an hour or two in total time to download, problem is that the so called Warcraft demo was a Warcraft trailer.. The biggest disappointment of the late 90s/early 2000s
---
I'll be playing Queen, because it was what my dad always played on his CD player while he was ironing in the next room when I was questing in Loch Modan.
---
Cheers for all the replies guys. This sounds great. Tanking in dungeons is my favourite roll but I also really enjoy PvP so this sounds good. After I finish arms tree I guess I can chuck last 20 points or however many it is in prot. Toughen my tanking up for 40-60 dungeons and give me more survivability in PvP. This was my first post btw. Since I quite Cata I've never even thought about wow. Since hearing about classic I can't seem to think about anything else........
---
Yeah, I wanna know it also!
---
Healers doesn't need healing spec and warriors don't need protection spec in the Dungeons on your way to 60.
---
Soldat the game? Holy shit, someone else played that?
---
The lack of balancing is my key worry for classic. In no means does anyone want BFA class design, but having half the specs not matter and only having Warrior tanks sucks. I normally main tanks but I might not for classic because warrior to me is way too boring when you have options like warlocks, hunters or shamans. I'd love to tank as a paly but I like many others ain't gonna level up a char to do a certain thing and not be able to.
---
I hope so. I am purely going off rumor, I am not in the beta.
---
[Can't wait to listen to this entirely and see I only leveled up twice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFnCzUxLU8)
---
EU EAST, PVE/PVP, not a big issue to me. Most likely PVE.
---
I work full time and have a girlfriend but I'm looking for someone who would like to take a week or two weeks off to level hard and practice leveling routes in private servers prior to Launch to do a smooth run once WoW goes live. 
---
SEMI-HARDCORE.
---
Classes that we would play would be: paladin/warrior/warlock
---
or combos like rogue warlock or rogue mage.
---
Im almost in my thirties and a cool guy! Let me know!
---
Also I would expect there will be a trial of some sorts, so buying a whole month may be uneccessary
---
Wonder if pets are scaling on classic... maybe some left over things from the move to classic. Like how you could (don’t know if you still can) tame a pet 2 levels higher. Or how a quiver was shown on your back instead of melee weapons.
---
Maybe play on a RP server as well?
---
I’ll probably just continue listening to light of the seven on a loop.
---
It's the same thing when people asked Matt &amp; Trey about a Pokemon GO episode. "Why? There's already a Chinpokomon episode."
---
BM was the raiding spec of TBC (unless you were clever with gear and a good hunter then you could make Survival work), but MM was King in Classic.
---
Keen to play with you mate, whatever you bring.
---
Those realms are not the beta. Those are for the stress test that begins in about 13 hours and will stay up for 48 hours. The beta severs have completely different names.
---
Nice! I want to play a paladin, or a holy priest dps or something. I saw we stand up to the elitists and play something not optimal together!
---
Linkin Park - With You reanimation for me!, heard it in world of roguecraft and it's what got me into Linkin Park :D

Ah yes, Mantrid, a gentleman and a scholar.
---
alright chill out ya nerd
---
I have played many vanilla pservers with the main focus to just farm enough gold for consumes and then using them in raid. I enjoy raiding even though its the same thing every server. The class I play and the people I play with is the new dynamic I enjoy. A side effect of raiding  is that I have been a part of some fun communities that I still keep in touch with.
---
Your statement should be "Vanilla Wow is not all about raiding". Some people like ganking lowbies, some ranking, some world pvp, farming gold etc. Raiding is a big part of Vanilla and is a big part of creating guild communities.
---
Cool, yeah I think druids and ret palas are getting alot of grief because they are not meta specs. But I actually think druids are very needed and superfun to play. I never really went pala, could not face the leveling. 
---
I'll probably be rolling a lock, although I am a bit of altoholic so I will have plenty of chars to choose from. Creating a guild sounds good! Are you planning on playing on a pvp server?
---
lol, meme specs won't be carrying jack shit.
---
Your spec sucks and you won't really be able to pull your weight. You can't really justify your raid spot. You're only a little bit better than _nothing_ - and honestly, often not even that, because you want the gear all the viable specs want. Maybe if every single solitary warrior etc. had every single piece of gear they need, then I'd be willing to start gearing the holy paladins' off-/memespecs etc. Huh, maybe the meme specs are really the "social specs" because you have to be social and a nice person for anyone to give enough of a fuck about you to carry you through the raids. 
---
Enjoy your pity raids, buddy.
---
Selling junk is: materials to create poisons from boxes, food, empty flask, other trash items.
---
Selling other items went on AH, bear in mind blind dust might cost a lot after game releases.
---
EVE online had there = to the wow token when classic was a thing.
---
The interesting thing to note about eve that is a game that was famous for its backstabbing and underhand tactics os that the game time codes/plex were one of two items that were regulated with rules that GMs would enforce. 
---
(The second item was characters for in game currency)
---
I personally feel that it worked great against gold farmers.
---
They announced an eu stress test in July, so they likely just pushed the launcher out to everyone.
---
All my friends just want a pally tank and aoe mass pull every dungeon. Gets old after the initial excitement.
---
Rogue Diary sells for 2 silver 45 copper on classic beta.
---
You should applaud "kids" wanting to play classic
---
&gt; None of them likely ever planned on coming near you guys
---
So why do we have to be thrown together, hateful and spiteful, when Blizzard is perfectly able to smooth out some retarded mechanics and nudge a few numbers so that memespecs are no longer retarded?
---
And yes, I'm well aware it's hard to avoid carrying people. I'm just not looking forward to it.
---
Alliance has boats.  Horde has boats that fly.  Do the math.
---
Getting an SSD for 20 euro gave me the same feeling. What a performance boost
---
Omg i couldnt remember hardware lag until this comment. Holy shit Ironforge.
---
Where did you get 400 ms from?
---
No problem Captain =)
---
It’s about getting that streamer money ofc
---
Wizard can just wish the key target into the void....
---
No rules without exceptions. It is perfectly fine, and even the best way of playing to preshield the tank sometimes.
---
I'll make a bombadin for pvp. Very specific gear requirements, very specific talent requirements, utterly useless in PvE, even worse against casters. But against melee... They beat themselves to death on you and that is just glorious.
---
Hope there will be no streamers ruining this test again with their "race to silithus" or "hey lets go to stv arena" stuff.  
---
Test the leveling in the first few zones, you literally have one job. Dont fail at it.
---
Probably from the blue post where they mention the 400 ms batching used prior to MoP.
---
Interesting that you associated Gimli with wife.
---
The idea is that your interface shows a progress bar to when your next atttack will be ready.
---
It's useful so that you can easily loot between swings, but also, more importantly, so you can hamstring kite.
---
The idea behind hamstring kiting is simple: your attacks need to be significantly slower (in seconds) than your opponents. You slow your enemy (at low levels you might not need to if mobs are already slow enough), and then you run away from them, and only slow down and let them catch up when your swing timer is up.
---
As a result, their swing timer is artifically slowed down to match yours and their damage per second drops as a result. 
---
It's not at all clear  that this will work in the beta due to melee leeway, and it's not hard to learn if it will work.
---
It's also largely irrelevant for a lot of races for the first 10 levels as you need a VERY slow one hander to make it worth it (hamstring is a lot of rage), and so until you start really using 2 handers, it's not going to be worth doing.
---
I'm fine with hard raids that I never will experience myself because that's part of the mystery. I never sat a good into aq or naxx but I thought it was the coolest thing ever seeing gear from there. Because it meant these people have been there
---
I don't even have an active WoW subscription and I can download it. I would assume that neither of us can participate in the stress test as you need to be NA and have an active sub.
---
I'll save you some worry now then, Blizzard isn't doing any balance patches or changes at all, so if that is a deal breaker for you, you might not want to bother. They are updating core Bnet features like friends list and group chats etc. because it's on the current Bnet client now, and small UI changes like updated raid frames, but we won't be seeing any mob or class changes that weren't in Vanilla because that is apparently what everyone wants. I'm not part of the #NoChanges movement at all, I'm just letting you know ahead of time that hoping for any changes is a waste of time, unfortunately.
---
That's the whole reason Classic is being brought back, because most of these people want that raw grittiness and does not trust Blizzard to balance anything at all without ruining it. While I would like to see class balancing because I want to play Ele shaman and Boomkin myself, I am pretty sure Blizzard would probably fuck it up somehow too, so I understand why they are so adamant about that.
---
Implying I ever stopped listening to this. Welcome to my gym jams playlist ;);)
---
When I see humans in WoW I either think it’s a try hard min/maxer or a boring potato
---
That is one element where no one can turn back the time, no matter how close classic is to vanilla. People just know a lot more about the game (or think they know it).
---
However I'm not sure they can't learn.
---
On a private server, I have done dungeon runs with 3 cloth damage dealers, a hunter and me as a healer (not heal specced) and we all had a great time. Sure, we had one that joined the group, noticed we didn't have a tank and immediately left, which is fine. So the mind set of making it work instead of optimizing everything from the start can still come back. You just don't always need the perfect group to suceed, and often it is easier to make do with what you got than sit around waiting.
---
Of course, when more planning is involved like with raids, people will try to optimize, but there is a point of diminishing returns for less elitist guilds and raid groups, where optimizing starts to be more work and time consuming than just rolling with it. Especially when nowadays you still can deal with the raids way easier than you could back then. A more casual guild doesn't have to be stuck wiping through MC for half a year anymore, times have changed.
---
The young people won't like this game. They will try because of the hype. This game is hard and doesn't give instant gratification. You can't buy skins. You don't have epics at level 5. It takes more than a week to get to max level. At max level content is slim and you need to make your own. Not a game for kids.
---
Soilwork - nerve is probably my fav one
---
I’m a hordie through and through, I never got the undead hype. I suppose they’re cool if you’re an edgelord metalhead.. but that’s not me
---
This makes me feel weird and a little uncomfortable. I guess I'm getting old.
---
Turning of running and slow walking towards crowds (like IF or entering black rock) was the only way I didn't end up in the ditch or swimming in lava.
---
The album that will always remind me of Vanilla is Advance and Vanquish by 3 Inches of Blood. Leveling my paladin with my mate while blasting destroy the orcs.
---
Swing timer is useful for everyone imo, especially melee classes for obvious reasons. It tells you when your enemies swing will be available and when yours will be available.
---
Say you're fighting a mob with an attack speed  of 2 seconds and you're wielding an axe with a 3.6 swing timer. Your attacks hit harder than his. If you hamstring (or slow him by some other means) you can kite him until your swing is ready.
---
Since you're trading blows 1 for 1, you're doing more damage and avoiding taking a second or third blow.
---
Even if they get to end-game the content is slim. You need to make your own.
---
&gt;Remember that every class can raid in one way or another, so there are hundreds of reasons to choose a class but 'ability to raid' is not a valid one.  
---
This is more important than people realize.  You can take 20 Rets into BWL and a mix of everything else for the other 20 and do fine.  People are so much better these days than we were that the margin for error is much greater.  Anyone trying to arrange perfect raid comps is going to realize very quickly that its overkill for such relatively easy encounters.  People should just play what they want and as long as everyone is trying at least a little, your raids should go smoothly.
---
Hi me, its you!
---
I remember playing a prot pally around level 40-50. When I would pvp I couldnt force any kills on casters or healers but I loved when a rogue or warrior would attack me and basically kill themselves while doing no dmg lol
---
Scary that there’s people as dumb as OP. TAKE MY MONEY, PLEASE..
---
[...And when you follow your Dad's example by drinking only Mountain Dew from launch day](https://streamable.com/6s2xl)
---
Bobby B will become sentient and find his way to all subs eventually.
---
Wow. I have no idea how you can play to level 10 and no be completely addicted already haha
---
I think it's a question as to how well the game design holds up. When everything is slower and there aren't enough people, you'll get less picky about who you invite. The main thing I'm worried about is layering, but hopefully by average level 30 people will thin out considerably.
---
But you can't just give some hybrid utility and lower the main roles efficiencies and call it a day. That is the lazy way and will make hybrids underpowered.
---
For example, prot should have had a taunt. The prot war vs prot pala could have been done so much better. Allow both to tank properly against single target in terms of threat, but let the warrior get it from doing more damage and the paladin from more of utility abilities that generate threat. 
---
And for ret, obviously their utility don't come close to making up for the poor dps. Shaman are better designed in that regard because of totems, they just needed some strong talent modifier to for example WF totem in deep enh (or make it exclusive for enh). This way you can't just bring a resto for it and resto will still be good due to their extreme AoE healing.
---
I know Classic was made in another time and the community was also way different back then (less meta orientated), but looking back it is honestly extremely easy to make most specs viable. There will always be a min/max composition, but at least the gap could have been way smaller.
---
https://youtu.be/mPIwKxBD16E
---
Keagnome Reeves, I like it.
---
You and me both brother.  For the VTC fight I would stand at the wall with camera all the way zoomed to have any chance to heal decently.
---
They probably just browse on their phones
---
Auto attack timers are necessary for rogues, warriors, hunters and enh shamans. Maybe even retri palas. You can time your abilities in between swings and overall just be careful for not interrupting your swings or canceling out autos by accident. For rogue you would want energy watch as well, to watch the energy ticks.
---
You need a RP server.
---
Aye I get that, I don't trust blizzard either, they have had a great track record recently with killing there own games. I do hope what ever they do following this if any it does involve better balanced classes while still having there uniqueness.
---
‘Streamer Realm’
---
Blessing of freedom is just disgustingly strong in BGs and world pvp. So is blessing of protection and your own bubble.
---
You are also extremely mana efficient and can pop up good heals and buffs, but there are obvious weaknesses: holy paladin might be one of the most vulnerable casters against silences/kicks since you only have ONE USEFUL SCHOOL and your autos are as good as nothing.
---
If you like paladin get used to fakecast a lot, and if you get caught in your school consider yourself screwed. But if you keep distance it's a really strong healer. Hammer of Justice is also massive if you get close enough.
---
Oh no, you might have to actually interact with people in an MMO
---
I believe it was instituted mid to late WoD, so the first “release” of names would’ve been Legion for any accounts inactive since Cata
---
It's a good rate, but keep in mind it's not a very realistic farm since you're not getting XP, and the goal is to get to max level ASAP if you want to make gold.
---
You'd be better off farming mobs for cloth/Ele Fire or even just gray drops if you want to grind for your mount.
---
Or that Mulgore quest where you have to feed the dog
---
There two main points I'd like to address:
---
* Being able to respec to another role: this should not be an issue when it comes to balance imo. Because of you spec as dps you effectively cannot heal. If there is a tax, it cannot be substantial because that makes playing the taxed role straight up unviable. In this argument, I'm not taking utility within the dps spec into account.
---
* Utility I'm addition to dps: You are right that utility that a dps class brings to the raid should be taken into account. But balance in that regard has nothing to do with homogenization. Every dps spec could have the same amount of utility, but the utility itself can be different. E.g. a feral druid has a party wide buff vs. a rogue with hemorage. Both are substantially different from one another, but could be equally strong. Depending on how much utility a class actually brings to a group/raid their dps can be reduced by that amount. But as it currently is, to get back to the feral example, the utility is way too low to justify the reduction in dps (as you stated as well).
---
To summarize: Yes, utility definitely has to be taken into account. But the ability to respec should not be (substantially) because at the very moment you can only be either dps or healer. In a balanced game, everything has to be viable otherwise people will be less likely to choose the class or be disappointed.
---
I don't get the whole "class/talent X is not optimal they should never be in raids". From a numbers point of view it's perfectly possible to kill patchwork with only bringing the worst possible dps specc. You won't break any speedrecords, you will need a significantly better equipped raid and you need players bringing their A game but it's entirely possible. 
---
In the end heavy class/specc optimizations hurts raids way more then it brings benefits except for raids going for records. 
---
Without personal loot or farming content for 3+ years you can't afford to bring only rogues/warriors. Simply as that. Not enough best in slot to go around even with a bribed loot fairy.
---
There's also the neat little issue of guild/raid cohesion. I was in a top guild back in TBC. Not the best guild of the server but maybe rank 2/3. If you attract people with your optimized raids and successes you also have to keep them. We had dozens of recruits who after getting a few pieces of gear joined with the next better raiding guild and we where forced to gear up a replacement.
---
I rather have a semi casual raiding guild with a ret paladin and a shadow priest because I know they WILL stay around because nobody higher up will take them. They are also highly motivated to support the raid, show up on time and work with encounter mechanics because they know that they can't compete in DPS with equal "pure DPS". 
---
Of course, all those sub optimal speccs need to understand that same as a full raid of rogues and warriors won't work a full raid of retribution paladins won't work either.
---
Thanks.
---
He may be married to a cross-dressing dwarf with a big beard and belly?
---
I remember this video of a mage in AV just absolutely destroying everyone
---
That's what I'm doing. I'm fairly settled on lock, but I'll also be leveling a warrior because I quite like tanking and I want to keep that path open. Really depends on whether I'll find the right guild or if I'll have to make my own, etc.
---
That's why I didn't recommend that.
---
yes?
---
I hope all of those servers will show full later when they are up.
---
https://youtu.be/SwSR1SHYZRI
---
I think the raid orientation is honestly because the large block of more casual players is just not on reddit. This is a problem in many MMORPGs. The feedback of the 1% drowns out the rest.
---
chances are the streamer will play wow classic longer than most of the players who will quit at lvl20

Distracting shot kiting the chicken to the other side of the world. (I don't know if this is possible)

Good.
---
Tbh, I find the whole BiS think entertaining and it reveals fun quests to do sometimes.
---
Ret's mobility is so utter shit though... Good luck getting to anybody in Bg's! But it's indeed good if your gear is great.
---
Hundreds of thousands for the last 10 years. A strong community that's not about to die.
---
Yes it is as good, the player base is older and the game is balanced enough and the economy is stable so that the game is fun to play.
---
You still need to make friends and group. World PVP is still everywhere. Raiding is still very challenging.
---
The game as aged very good.
---
I can’t listen to Coldplay without thinking of playing vanilla in my brothers room, taking turns at the computer

Well, you do know what 'work' did in the end though? :)

Orc warriors rule the Horde

I feel you man. I wish I could find out what the average 1-10 time is so I could compare my results to that lol
---
The current way you deal with spam in games that can support it, is through RegEx filters. The general idea (whether sound or not) is that spam is mostly targetted at idiots, so if you need to download an addon to block it, spammers don't much mind.
---
Kek
---
You just but I've met cool people playing games before and I expect that trend to continue, and I'll be getting some RL friends into the game, as well.

Ahh my first LAN song, 6th of january 2011.

I will never forget that time &lt;3

Hmm true, I forgot that blocking addons are probably a thing as well.

---
Shitting on LP and a7x?
---
You are bold.
---
That's funny, I have a similar plan
---
2 accounts
---
Sham/Lock and Pally/Druid first
---
Not sure what after that, but mage/priest last since I played a ton of them at 60 already.
---
Hadn't thought about boosting too much, I did a LOT of that in TBC and Wrath.  Would probably be faster to boost even single characters than to level duos without a DPS/healer setup IMO. 
---
Originally I was hoping they would have a "classic only" sub or something for like $5 a month, I was going to run 2 full 5 man teams and just level in dungeons.  But at full sub price I will just do it a little slower with 2.
---
I’m min maxing for raiding and will be jumping between both versions of the game. Am I playing it wrong then?
---
We don't exist. If the EU server burn and die on launch for us, we know why.
---
You won't be main tank and guild won't take 8 cats instead of 8 fury warriors, but there will be raids that take a feral offtank, just be prepared to be stuck with adds or offtanking in some fights, do dps or decurse or even heal in others.
---
Or go resto and be a solid member of the healing team, probably not topping the meters (which don't matter much in healing anyways) but you bring buffs and utility that no one else has.
---
Hell, depending on how many people read and follow the "who is best" mantra, you might be the underrepresented class that raids are looking for all the time.
---
Plus outside you got all your tools and stuff that makes a druid unique.
---
Trolls too, lots of them
---
"illusion of choice"? There are at least 15 different ways to specc a paladin. All of them have a use for questing, 5 man content, raid content, pug bg pvp, world pvp, duels.
---
Lol bro same here. I’m gettin the wife and kids two adjoining rooms at a hotel for the weekend. She is stoked that her and her friends can chill at a hotel and have a “girls weekend”. Price did not matter to me. I will be leveling with the bros.
---
I would but i just dont like metal anymore
---
I remember killing him in one of your first like 3 tries with me and another priest mindcontrolling.
---
We specced a little into shadow for the hit and i dont even remember early breaks being an issue.
---
However on week 3 another priest wanted to do the honors and somehow the Mind Control always broke for him, 100% sure he moved or something.
---
Yeah most people didn't hit 60 until TBC was released. I remember my brother hitting 60 but he was like 1 of maybe 20 in a 300 + guild? So yeah it was pretty rare
---
There is probably a large group of potential players that dont play pservers, myself included, because it is not official. I wasnt ever convinced that the pserver would exist in a couple months. the "blizzlike" servers werent ever that great not to mention the awful lag so I lost interest. It wasnt until I heard that some pserver called nostalrius was shut down that I realized how much progress pservers had made but that just confirmed to me that pservers dont last.

I am going to roll a hybrid Shaman with 30/0/21 for PvP only. I will stand back assist the FC dispell shit, heal and CRIT WITH CHAIN LIGHTNING all day.
---
You retarded?
---
Soupa has an awesome wow classic YouTube channel too guys
---
He's spot on and it's something I've been saying on here for awhile. "don't expect a raid spot if you don't play x" it's ridiculous, unlike every expansion vanilla WoW isn't solely about the end game, and secondly the raids are largely a joke in comparison to the current ones you don't need to min max DPS to easily clear it, and hell people put far too much value in DPS over other things on live too. 
---
The fact is, people will not have the luxury to stack all of their raids with Fury Warriors, Combat Rogues, and Frost Mages, you are going to have to work with other classes/specs as well.
---
Me and my friends made one
---
inb4 someone makes a ryzen 7 3950x + 2080ti + 32gb ram system but uses a cheap offbrand psu and an cheap 5400rpm hdd for classic.
---
Ye I would rather not pvp then start a Disturbed song
---
That is pretty epic!!! Love it!!!
---
I haven't seen anyone mention this yet. There's a trinket from the fish boss in ZG that gives you 10% additional hit, chance called [\[Nat Pagle's Broken Reel\]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19947) 
---
The reason you need so many tanks on four Horsmen is that each boss gives a different stacking aura and the raid needs to rotate, to avoid getting to many stacks from a single boss. If a tank get his taunt resisted then that horseman will run over to the previous tank and a wipe is imminent.
---
So either you need warriors with the tier 3 4-set bonus or that 
---
trinket. 
---
There's no need to respec, except mabye on progression.
---
You won't be carrying anyone so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
He did!
---
You need 2 for mag and 1 is doable. Chrom can be done with 2 if the hunters are given lots of dust, and 4 is enough otherwise. Too many hunters on chrom is kinda just a waste of dust.
---
Look at my badge bro. Than stfu
---
Yes, precisely. Vanilla damage buttons tread down the slippery slope towards retails Ret, if Crusader strike had different effectd depending on the active seal that would make it worthy I believe.
---
Yes a bit, also this was a friendly joke not criticism. Seems everything on reddit is considered as toxic
---
Yay, melee server names...
---
Anyone who thinks that 85% of people will quit WoW Classic in the first few weeks is an idiot, straight up.
---
I'm trying to kill my hype much as possible so I can stop thinking about classic 24/7 and the release comes faster then. :P
---
Have you ever actually done hardcore progression raiding before? What's your experience?
---
They're dropping new songs now too!
---
*HIGHER! THE KING OF THE SKY*
---
&gt; i think it is important to have hard raids/content like that. it really builds the game's mystique, creates a sense of awe/wonder/hugeness/etc
---
There's a video from around 2006 or so where the devs explicitly mention that hard content is absolutely vital for the game world feeling huge - it gives you a horizon to strive for. Which makes it all the more tragic that as by WotLK, they had abandoned this paradigm.
---
hell no lol
---
I did play in vanilla, pretty hardcore at that. I spent 175ish hours levelling to 60 (7days something played, about 11 days IRL), then another 7000+ hours at level 60. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
you haven't played WoW until you've played it to Backstreet Boys and NSYNC

hahaha I even changed my schedule for when I return to work after the 9days so that I work the night shift, that way I can play at work for a couple of nights too.
---
Planning is key :D
---
Yeah... all those layering exploits wont destroy server economy...
---
Damn, what a sausage fest. Totally wish I was there though
---
It’s because leveling to 60 is a huge time investment as well as being a lot of fun and exploration the way you put it - it can be both. Thus, people want to make sure that they can actually keep playing the game after 200 hours, and don’t have to either alter their play style in a way they don’t like, or reroll.
---
I think what’s more likely to happen tho is your second point, that people will be clearing a lot of raid content in guilds where people have sub-par specs, since today’s players know or terms like “rotations”, whereas you had players beat Rag while spamming a suboptimal ability etc
---
The way they said it makes it sound like it’s not something you can do in retail
---
No you dont need to, but it'll make you a better tank. Same as healers dont need to spec into healing, they can have hybrid specs as long as they stack healing gear. 
---
You should get a shield and a fast one hander,  and then you can tank in any spec.  
---
Might need to think about respeccing into Prot when you are 55-57 and starting to the the level 60 instances. I'm leveling a shammy and will go full resto at this stage too. Prior to this, I'm leveling as ele.
---
Joana's guide won't match up with some of the incredibly finely tuned starting zone only guides, which makes sense: it's a bit like comparing a 100% speedrunner with an any% one.
---
This is so awesome. I work an evening shift at a water treatment plant. Basically I am there for emergencies. I definitely will be getting paid to level. We have become wiser with the passing time lol. Good luck and I hope your master plan works out perfectly!
---
Of course PvP Server , i like the open World pvp a lot! Feral druids and rets can hold their own with the right Gear/speccs/comsu. We could set up a discord server and start building ;)
---
Every single patch except for diremaul is about raiding. Saying vanilla wow isn't about raiding is disingenuous. There literally won't be any new contents for non-raiders 4 months into classic, every subsequent patch rewards and any gear progression will come from raid.
---
Yes it is. But for new players it does not make sense looking into this stuff too much already.
---
But I totally agree, going for the preraid BiS is always fun, great quests and indtances.
---
Oh yeah... give them even more money for excluding europeans from the stress test.
---
Imagine one hour trying to kill the same mobs one by one to get to the quest. As soon as you aggro two your dying over and over. Then mobs have spawn behind you so you can't rez. You need to rez at the shrine and have to pay repairs and wait 10 minutes to try again.
---
Now there's a mage running in and killing them 5 at the time. In and out. He killed the mob you needed for the quest.
---
That's something you will experience 1/2 quest. Play warrior as your 2nd toon. Once you know more and have friends who can help you get a whirlwind at 30. Else your hell won't stop then.
---
I think everyone wants them to go from Classic to branching out into an alternate TBC, Wrath etc. Keeping most of the world, raids and dungeons largely the same, but changing all the class design, loot mechanics and overall feel of them to be more like Classic going forward.
---
The news that they are doing a level squish though is bad. It means they are going to try and get Classic players to transfer their characters over to retail at the end of Classic. Which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but it also means they want to unify everyone in retail instead of keeping us in Classic. At best, maybe they will take queues from Classic and make the next expansion after BFA is done a little more like Classic. They won't kill their casual fanbase though, so it won't be a huge change either way. Sad.
---
True, though it bears mention that WoW released later in the EU than in the US, which means that EU players were playing catch-up a lot. I was in a raid that had started on Naxx, and we made it some way inside - but BC dropped while we were still getting stomped by the Four Horsemen.
---
And that basically was the state of all raiding guilds on my server: They were progressing through Naxx (we did not have really hard-core guilds, but we had ambitious "med-core" ones), but BC arrived before any got a Kel kill.
---
Just putting up a littel differentiation; Killing a raid's ultimate boss is not equivalent with running the raid; Quite some people were running Naxx, it's just that barely any managed to complete it before BC hit.
---
Yes, where?
---
That reminds me... what is the goto source fo WoW videos as of now? Is it still warcraftmovies? So when Classic hits and there will be some awesome new pvp videos, is that gonna be the main source?
---
Are you trolling?
---
Fuck Daggerspine with a rusty knife.  I just know there are three fuckers out there just waiting to sit on the only GM spots until the end of rankings.
---
Happy you liked it dude :D
---
As someone who just did this on servers who shall not be named, I tanked upto ST in mainly arms/fury. I also did BRD upto the 7 dwarves event. After that and other end game dungeons speccing protection helped a lot.
---
Ah, yeah, those good old PvP videos that basically just showed a crit followed by a jump cut while playing metal in the background. Made the game look way faster than it actually was and gave a pretty wrong sense of how powerful some classes actually were. Yes, enhancement shamans were always shit, despite beeing able to oneshot a mage sometimes.
---
The quest to get Rhok'delar was the most fun I had in classic
---
The castbar addons with by parsing the combat log.
---
I must disagree when you talk about investment to reach endgame 
---
The lvling experience for someone new will take weeks or months, depending on the player.
---
But compared to other games, wow classic lvling is enjoyable ! You meet friends, do crazy stuff, grind if it is your jam or talk about your life in /1 stranglethorn vietnam.
---
Only Classic. I quit wow in 2012 when Cata was released. I cant wait to get back to classic and the level cap being 60, with no expansion round the corner!
---
Just tank in your normal spec, no points in prot needed
---
My guess is it will go away very fast. Not even a quarter of kids who try will get to 20. That is a bigger problem then layers. I didn't like server merging at all. I had to change my name.
---
Tho, not beeing informed about class choice and their role in the endgame might lead to frustration when people start realizing that their choice is actually not what they are supposed to do later on.
---
In vanilla days people learned that the hard way, nowadays it is well known and people should be made aware of that.
---
I'm surprised how well mine ran it now that I think about it. I started in I think 06, on the family prebuilt Sony Vaio on with an.. FX 5200? and I can't remember what else. But I don't remember having any problems in 40 mans.
---
And where am I now? 1800x with a Vega 64. Lol it's so surprising that people are curious if their computer can run Classic. I'm sure it's different from back then but any average computer from the last decade should be fine.
---
Ty for making this
---
Did Troll Priest's Shadowguard ability always look like Lightning Shield in Vanilla? I was pretty sure it had it's own graphic. Maybe that came in TBC.
---
Was Windfury even implemented before they "nerfed" AV?
---
Wonder if it'd work if I have an expired NA account and an active EU account. Not sure I'll be staying up to check, though.
---
Its true that endgame is designed for more mature players, but younger players can still get a great experience from the game. The long path to 60 means that players who know little of the mechanics of the game and young players who play very casually (because parents might be limiting their playing hours) still have a lot of rewarding content to complete before having to set aside hours apiece to raid or push PvP rank.
---
Nice, thanks for this
---
Blame the elitist players for that, those that will shit on you if your spec brings only 98% the same as the cookie-cutter spec.
---
You missed out THE BEST themed PvP videos.
---
World Of Roguecraft.
---
We had mandatory flasks and for some encounters like Loatheb we mandated shadowpots,
---
We also used worldbuffs like ... twice ? i remember meeting in STV
---
I'm still not sure if I want to be an horde paladin or an alliance shaman.
---
Also I'm surprised how many warlock in the horde.
---
I have never done a dun murogh speed level session, and seeing that there are plenty of people already posting gnome mage speedruns, I doubt I will break any records. Monkeynews and Staysafe have excellent routes for gnomes starter areas!
---
You could also check out: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=904

Several gnome runners posted there :)
---
About 10% (some say up to 20%, but no more than that) made it to level 60 before BC launched.
---
81 Asian players feelsbadman
---
Yeah cool man. Your very welcome to become part of community and dont take take my words the wrong way. But why would you even bother? When you have no connection to it and still "young". Why not play something with a future instead of a past? Or play something with your friends? 
---
I told my lil bro to go Explorer other games and leave WoW to us. "Get your own thing with your own friends". 
---
Yeah Wow is fun but, there are more games than WoW. For me Wc3 and WoW just feel very comfy, because I have this past.
---
Personally I've never been a big fan of leveling. Although I do think it's a good thing that it takes time to get max level so you get more invested in your character. That being said I still think there's a lot of fun to be had outside of raiding and pvp. Most of my time at 60 was spent just doing random stuff and hanging out.
---
Mine says I'm banned.. Dafaq??
---
I feel like this is a high quality video from years gone by.
---
It certainly was less than 20% about raiding for me; world PvP and PvP were the majority of it, and that was where I built most of my memories up to this day.
---
can the seals crit or only the judgment ? and is it spell or melee crit based ?
---
I agree'd with you until:
---
&gt;There is so much more to the game than raiding.
---
There is no achievements to hunt, there is not many unique mounts to collect (especially if youre horde) there is not many special pets to get (hunter pets were very limited back then)
---
There is basically only progression on your character.
---
So raids are a BIG part of the game and ppl should know that certain classes just arent that great if you want to see all the raid content.
---
Could you have have fun with a less viable spec in 5 mans? 
---
Sure!
---
Its perfectly fine to play what you want but you can't just let ppl think that every spec back then was good. They really wasn't.
---
Naxx is no joke. AQ40 wasn't either and most guilds back then didnt even kill C'thun.
---
You want ppl to level to 60 and then just be told sry no room for you ret pally?
---
Id rather ppl know it before hand, and select what they want to play knowing this.
---
I don't know why but they were in the survey. I didn't want to let them out :-)
---
I remember back in WoD there was a disc priest, who played using a controller, and managed to hit #3 world healing logs on Mythic Archimonde.
---
Playable for EVERYTHING.
---
ITT: People who are taking the meme way too seriously.
---
Yes. This is outrageous. Only my way of having fun is allowed. :^)
---
Dont forget Papa Roach and Rise Against
---
Mix in some Static-X too
---
Undergeared rogues hitting a shadow priest is like undergeared rogues hitting a warrior.  Inner fire and shadow form meant something back in vanilla.
---
Stay strong my brother!
---
If you level on PVP server arms is a must in my opinion.
---
Yeahh.. well... there are things one should know to avoid the biggest mistakes, like leveling tailoring to warrior when the end game products are suited for cloth. Or that leatherworking has mail patterns in the end to complement shaman / hunter classes.
---
How Shamans 0.2% Alliance?
---
The first progression servers were in 2006. And they're nothing like WoW Classic. It's basically just like retail WoW/EQ but with certain features and zones turned off. It's not really a true classic experience by any means. For that you have to go to Project 1999, which is essentially the Nostalrius of EQ.
---
In the launcher alone?
---
No, he does leveling guides for every class. Check his website, just choose your class on the sidebar, and it updates to fit your class.
---
"Mom get off the phone i need to raid in 3 minutes!!"

Those were the days.

What a legend
---
Ah interesting to know. Thanks.
---
This is my first laptop in the USB C era. 
---
My previous one came with a thumping great big charger that was 180W. But the new laptops all have tiny little phone chargers (at most 87W but mostly 65W). 
---
So my question is, is the performance significantly different between being on and charge and not being on charge as large as it once was?
---
THESE WOUNDS, THEY WILL NOT HEAAAAAL
---
And whats im portant in dungeons is different than whats important in raids with only some overlap. You are making op's point. Don't just look at raiding, look at the whole picture.
---
I am EU and just got the launcher and able to see the server list
---
Using an ability reset the swing timer? Do I have to time my abilities just after a swing?
---
These are the three specs I plan to play! 30/0/21 looks fun and I hope I can find groups for 5 mans to let me actually be balance but I'm ready to healbot. Alternatively I am also thinking that I will go HotW build if my friend group doesn't end up having a tank
---
How amazing is it that the Alliance/Horde split is 50.5/49.5?  I know it’s always been that way but it speaks to the great gameplay/story design
---
hells yess!!!
---
Aus. It's popped up now!
---
zombies, you can actually choose to play a freakin zombie! what's not cool about that?
---
would you have data on horde/alliance split for oceanic?  Or where can i see the feed?

Imagine being blind and calling people shit payers.
---
If you raided at all in vanilla you were hardcore. Remember, only 10% of players even got to 60.. to the vast, vast majority of players, 1-40 is what they experienced of vanilla wow. The majority of players didnt get to 50.
---
Does using an abilities reset the timer? Do I have to time my ability just after a swing?
---
The main route itself doesn't change though and there are multiple occasions where some classes will really struggle.
---
If discovering new dungeons, zones, raids etc. was what made the game special, then by definition the new WoW expansions should have been great. Afterall BFA is barely a year old, people disliked it only after a few days after its release.
---
Same goes for new games, many of them are major disappointments despite having new areas to "discover".
---
There is tons of new music and films being released every day, and yet how many of you still revert to the classics? How many put in a classic Guns n Roses album instead some new release from X band?
---
If the nostalgia argument had any legs to it, then nobody would be playing, listening or watching old stuff. Because its already been discovered. Yet that is clearly not the case.
---
I feel you on a deep level with this.  Was up until about 3 or 4 playing on a work night.
---
Because classic wow is an amazing game. You serious? I've only played since cata and I've been loving classic, its everything I wanted wow to become.
---
This with pat warr pvp video trully
---
Agreed. Also, happy cake day!
---
Yeah, same here, in raids i had my graphic settings set to minimum and on fights with lots of adds, especially in BWL, I'd be looking at the floor to ensure the fastest response times for my heals! In many parts of instacnes, even Onyxia, i'd not even see the whelps due to graphical lag, I'd just know I was been hit is I saw damage numbers appear on me!  
---
Can't actually wait to play the old raids and see what they really look like, lol
---
Yah I just saw that a while ago. I am eating my words now.
---
Someone else got me to check up on it lol
---
They already said they would not be doing that.
---
&gt; The news that they are doing a level squish though is bad. It means they are going to try and get Classic players to transfer their characters over to retail at the end of Classic.
---
What's this?
---
I'm sure we would enjoy it but  95% of the south park watching audience would be sitting there asking "WTF is a streamer?"
---
Well 1 Change is loottrading in raids...

---

---
I'll just put on my daily Spotify list on, pretty much every song and band mentioned in this post.
---
Streamers (and their posse) are probably less than 1% of the playerbase so I woudn't focus too much on them
---
Haha, and I thought my alt plans were too much! I don't quite have it fully mapped out but something like this:
---
1. Start my main Orc Warlock and see how the initial rush goes. Grab Fishing, Cooking, Tailoring, Herbalism. Try to get ahead on Tailoring.
---
2. At some point, not sure which, make a Tauren Warrior. Get Mining and Blacksmithing because I hate myself. Receive cooking meals from the Warlock. Level to about 10. Park in an inn for 10 days.
---
3. Make an Undead Priest. Get Herbalism and Enchanting. Level Enchanting enough to get Lesser Magic Wand and stop there. Level to about 10. Park in an inn for 10 days.
---
4. Make an Alchemy supplies bank alt. Level to 5 and park in a city. Calculate how much herbs I need to fully level Alchemy. Send all the herbs to this guy.
---
5. Make an AH alt. Level to 5, park in a city. Use to do AH things.
---
Mostly focus on Warlock, play the Warrior and Priest at the 10 day intervals until the rested XP is expired. Send greens to the Undead Priest to level Enchanting and/or sell things. Send all cloth to the Warlock. Send all herbs to the bank alt until sufficient to level Alchemy, sell the rest on AH.
---
This is probably not at all in the right order, idk how to really optimize this tbh, and I think there are too many unknowns with Classic.
---
You probably liked it 15 years ago when you were young, hence they will probably like it as well.
---
Scatman John is my anthem to the Thousand Needles, soon as I step in it's "Ski-bi dibby dib yo da dub dub".
---
Outland was also originally planed as the final content patch for vanilla.
---
Yeah, and I've played with plenty of people playing top tier specs who did dog shit DPS.
---
So the 8 warris include redundancy in case of missed taunts? Did I read this correctly?
---
I can just imagine a returning main tank going on in raids like "I know how to tank this you morons, ive done this before! and God was a strong back then!"
---
Sounds like a fake story.
---
is this a trick question? every wepon is hunter weapon!
---
I'm surprised rouges and hunters aren't higher.
---
There's no point beeing run a raid unless to have a chance on getting a loot. There's not that many loot in a 40 man raid, not that many useful loot. It would be counterproductive for everyone.
---
Gold and gold farmers on the other end was a real problem.
---
&gt; First of all, homogenized gameplay in retail sucks.
---
That's pretty harsh. I too enjoyed getting buttfucked by the system because my class didn't have a systemic defensive so the only viable comp was going 3s as a resto shaman. Now you can go 3s as any shaman spec. The current game would not run without everyone having an interrupt, a defense cd, some sort of selfheal unfortunately.
---
&gt;And even Ion admitted that the plethora of dampening skills/spells tends to stall matches and leads to unenjoyable gameplay.
---
It's either that or we're back to imba TBC level arena, where some comps just completely mopped the floor with you in seconds. I personally did not enjoy rogue/druid in 2s or rmp in 3s or slsllock/spriest/hpaly. I much prefer the dampening mechanic. Although we've seen better implementations of it in previous expansions.
---
&gt;Maybe he has no idea what is going on too.
---
He's the game director and has been playing this game for 15 years. I'm certain he's familiar with just about everything about the game.
---
Yeah. Currently I'm thinking Warlock for certain but last week I was definitely going to be a Mage and the week before I was very likely to be a Priest.
---
Maybe I'll do a rogue again?
---
Another fake story.
---
Yeah right!? D: 
---
Thanks for the clarification, that might be why I haven't seen it in more videos. It was Lolwtf as you presumed.
---
Exactly. This is why I play rogue instead of hunter. Even if I like them both
---
I guess I’m surprised to see shaman being second most played class on the horde. Is anyone else surprised by this?
---
I keep contemplating on which race / class I will pick for some raiding but realistically I play games so rarely that I will probably never even reach lvl 60 .-.
---
I also put all of Dr Hankeeys mixes into one big spotify playlist:   
---

---
Yes Slam for example
---
What's yours? Besides, do I have to personally be in a kitchen with professional chefs to know I'd be a drag on the process, because I'm nowhere near their level? No. Sure, the gap between you filthy peasant memespeccers and the glorious master race viable dps classes isn't quite as great, but it's still significant enough for me to not want to carry your asses, and I really doubt I'm in the minority.
---
Would the game really break for you if ret paladins and ferals weren't bottom of the barrel shit? Doesn't it kind of suck to have to rely on the kindness of others to carry you?
---
I love that all off their songs are about war. The lead singer even joked about it when I saw them live.
---
I really like the "help new players" thing. It's very silly. But I would love to meet you as a new player. Ppl used to do stuff like that before for no reason other than fun.
---
My plan: Going horde warrior (or maybe shaman). Get herbalism and alchemy. Just enjoy the game and level at my own speed. If I get hooked I will probably try for high pvp rank and late game raids.
---
Why would younger folks only care about instant gratification and fancy graphics? It's a human desire to be included in a social group, and Classic WoW is the best game to experience that. The lack of social integrative games on the market is what will draw people to this game, no matter what age you are.
---
19g with somewhat steady drops and if you get lucky with a world drop you can get a lot more gold too
---
Also, even when you get to raiding. It's not like you can spend every night raiding anyway, at least if you and your guild are decent players. Especially early on with MC and stuff, you will have probably one raid night per week, the rest of the time you got to find something else to do. So choosing your character based only on raid performance is kind of silly. 
---
And especially if you plan on doing PvP, raids are so easy there's no point going human warrior for example for the weapon skill racial. The actual challenge you are going to have is in PvP, so it's better to choose dwarf or gnome, or even night elf really.
---
Literally no one has said this, and you’re incredibly stupid if you think Blizzard hasn’t prepared for the massive influx of players and tourists, hence the implementation of layering. 
---
You don’t know what’s going to happen anymore than anyone else does. To talk like you do is just plain stupid.
---
Is that item good in any way? like would you take this over any other blue trinket or is it very situational, if even that.

I had great fun with this on a druid too, hitting moonfire or heal juuust after a swing to optimize. Good shit. Not sure if its the same on a shaman
---
"casts regrowth as a mage"
---
Believe it or not those things happen.
---
at the very minimum you can use them as a rough margin of error, although i don't think any of them end up being relevant
---
Nice comeback
---
People really get hurt over this kind of stuff. Funny, huh?
---
NA RP/PvE/PvP
---
Horde or Alliance
---
Late night player. Plan to run a tank/resto hybrid build druid running dungeons and maybe some raids.
---
That's not a terrible retention rate for an MMO to be honest. It'd be interesting to see how many of those people were playing free demo versions as that would skew the numbers by quite a bit, since players that have bought the game and paid for a months subscription are more likely to try and stick it out.
---
Some people are just so fast on the kick that they don't even hear it.
---
&gt; I don't get the whole "class/talent X is not optimal they should never be in raids".
---
Do you think people interpreted my above comment as meaning that?  I hope not.
---
I meant that the top DPS should probably be a pure DPS melee class (since ranged can more easily avoid mechanics) but also have the least utility.  Whereas the lowest DPS should have the most utility such that it's still highly desired in raids.
---
Anyway, a great thing about 40-player raids is that there's room for everyone.  Like you were saying, pulling out the average DPS required for Patchwerk (or any other boss) isn't going to be a problem for a player who's paying attention and playing their class right.
---
&gt; a full raid of retribution paladins won't work either.
---
Somewhat unrelated: which do you think would do better, a raid made up entirely of paladins or one made up entirely of druids?
---
I'm quite shocked a that. Always guessed it would be warrior&gt;mage&gt;rogue/hunter.
---
Shout out to the 57 people on that still dont know what side has paly/shaman
---
Indeed, half the human population are weak.
---
Out of interest could you try the iGPU of the i7 6600k ?
---
Or anyone tried an iGPU of a 6600k upwards?
---
hardcore for tryhards? Classic? lol
---
I thought  you meant through the fire and flames or whatever that song was from Guitar Hero. I swear it was in heaps of PvP videos but possibly later on in game..
---
I'd say ou're wrong on feral on MC, if he is dedicated and farms mcp, MC's short fights would make it quite good. Probably better than warlock. It all depends on fight length I think.
---
i think hunter is gonna be way more popular among casual players
---
Yes ofc, this is not a live game tho. The entire reason these players even have access to an unfinished state of the game is to try to break as many things as possible to have bugs and exploits fixed for the actual game release.
---
It’s not “extremely easy” to balance hybrids because the minute you make a mele class that can heal, clense, cc well,  AND give them great dps ? Suddenly you have the most overpowered pvp class and every warrior is rerolling.
---
Warlock third is the most surprising for me.
---
2006, eh? That's surprising to hear.
---
What makes you think Classic WoW is 'more authentic' than turning off features/zones? It's not like Blizzard rebuilt the old talents trees, or turned back itemization to old stats.

Oh really? I could've sworn it was 200. You learn something new each day I guess.

My weapon is so slow with a 2h warrior. Optimize a little would help.
---
That's not really true, in fact just recently Spelladin builds have become a thing. Spelladin builds (Ret Paladin that focuses on Spell power, weapon speed, and procs) were only very recently discovered and they can out DPS most outside of Warriors, Rogues and Mages. 
---
The theorycrafting is not completely solved by any means.
---
I'm not sure where you did the survey on (I assume here on reddit) but as always the results in statistical sampling can be skewed by the place you sample at. I made this comment some months back on earlier similar statistical thing, but for example reddit seems to enjoy warlocks alot more than you would expect for the average player. I also mentioned that personally I think warrior, mage, rogue will be the 3 most played classes followed by faction class (paladin/shaman) and hunter in the next tier and then by warlock and priest, with druid taking the dead last spot. These have kind of been the general preferences for quite a while with some faction differences like more warlocks on horde and more hunters on alliance, but usually the rest of the skewing comes from the platform you do the survey on. For example if a popular streamer does a poll on their twitter, they get response correlating with their fanbase, unless for example another popular streamer says go vote on his poll etc. Doing it on reddit gets reddits preferences. Best cencus can really only be achieved after launch and trying to eliminate bank alts and other statistical skewing things from there. That being said, I really love looking at these statistics, even if they are alittle bit skewed. Keep up the good work. Also the colored parts I would flip around diagonally so overall, america, and europe are all in the same column with each other.
---
Well ain't this just dandy.
---
Ah cataclysm, the beginning of the end haha
---
yeah when I hear any SoaD song I think of zangarmarsh because thats the area I was in when I first heard them. It's funny and I like it. I rarely hear SoaD so when I do its a nice experience.
---
CoB and dragon force are what remind me of vanilla the most.
---
Thats something I'm very interested in seeing. Naxx at 60 vs. WotLK Naxx is quite a difference. Ok high end pserver guild with heavily optimized raid, gear and world buffs won't break a sweat but for the average raider it will be hell. 
---
I still think Naxx had some very simple but highly lethal mechanics that allowed almost no room for errors. And that posed its own challenge at 40 players.
---
I hate this about retail so much. I can log on, I'm a literal God and can pull everything on screen. Hop on a mount and zoom around at insane speeds all at level 1 while looking like a raid tier badass level 60...
---
Nothing feels dangerous, all the other players around you most likely aren't even on the same server as you, there is so much going on with the ui now between collections, pets, mounts, ingame store, etc etc.
---
Then I log out and get depressed. So incredibly disappointing that wow ended up like this. Yeah there are still some cool things about retail, but it no longer feels like a world that's actually lived in with other players. It's like a big ass lobby, where you wait around and quest up for things.
---
It seems like the obvious answer.  I'd have no problem with layering on the first couple of zones (e.g. Northshire Abbey and Elwynn Forest) just to prevent major bottlenecks.  After that there should be no need as players thin out due to different levelling speeds.
---
&gt; It's not like Blizzard rebuilt the old talents trees, or turned back itemization to old stats.
---
But that's exactly what they did. The talent trees and itemization is "old" compared to Modern WoW.
---
So no experience then?
---
I love this playlist but I need to say - Skrillex is way off the mark, released in 2010. 
---
Really caught me off guard because I was about 9 when Vanilla was out and I was listening to skrillex at around 14 :P 
---
One last song - the scatman one was in so many PvP videos, aswell as Mambo no.5.
---
Almost everyone does. The question is how many like both games
---
&gt;Literally no one has said this
---
The person I responded to just said this.
---
&gt;You won't be carrying anyone
---
You'll be carried by everyone.
---
I'd like to see a MMO in the StarCraft universe with 3 factions.
---
Yeah i'll remove skrillex lol
---
Adding your songs now :D
---
Surely warrior won’t be top in molten core, it’s too gear dependent for them to be top in the very first raid. Also hunter way too high here.
---
For me, it was Scar Symmetry's Pitch Black Progress album. So many memories of playing AV with friends to that album!
---
Mankrik's Wife
---
only 9.70% hunters?
---
survey is worthless
---
If your concern about your health don't play wow.
---
uhhh.. alliance have always far outnumbered horde (1.5:1 or so)
---
The addon VanillaGuide is based on Joana's route. Ive been using it
---
Sorry but how do you know any of this?
---
Vanilla was 13+ years ago, things have changed drastically during that time, players aren't clueless children anymore and there's guides and wikis everywhere.
---
To say that majority won't hit max lvl is just absurd
---
There's videos of folks playing virtually every game in VR that could be played.
---
WoW is one of them. Time to hit that YouTube search, OP.

---
I took the survey which you can find on the reddit sidebar:
---
The main reason I did this was because the only polls existing are just an overall overview of all regions and horde/alliance. I wanted to split this up a bit.
---
Vael is literally that, it’s a high dps check.
---
You have a US starter account then.
---
Breaking Benjamin and Rise Against and that list is complete
---
Okay i dont know how to post, anyways I was thinking i wouldn’t really need wrath. So I Might just be better off taking this route for improved buffs.
---
Any thoughts?
---
Shitting on LP is bold? Jesus. I can't even think of music shitter than LP right now.
---
Outland was originally planned as final content patch for vanilla, and it ended up being a full expansion.
---
I don't think anyone knew for sure outland was coming but it was mentioned at by the devs during vanilla or beta at a blizzcon presentation, it was on list of things they had planned but the list also had the emerald dream and other similar zones.
---
The idea of official WoW servers with players having equally no wealth is quite appealing to me.
---
I was wondering about this as well, cause when people trash talk about Ret paladins they mention auto attacking and just hoping for a proc. But almost 45% on a decent weapon like unstoppable force, which anyone could get, is not some low crappy proc chance that you have to pray for. It's more than windfurry and more than most people chance to crit by far
---
I know ret in pve is weak but in pvp I think people are going to be surprised when they get killed by a decent Ret player
---
Most *raid* bosses. Are we all gonna forget the entire 5-man scene and PVP side here?
---
i actually just watched a frostadamus video on this survey from 6 months ago, when it had less than half as many responses. almost all of the ratios are still identical to what they were back then, which is pretty cool to see
---

Im no expert in boomies but why would you need natural shapeshifter? As a boomie do you ever need to shapeshifting in raids? Anyway boomie is never gonna be any good, some guild might take you along but you're gonna feel pretty useless
---
You misquote me, I said it is extremely easy to make all classes viable, not to fully balance it. "Viable" is of course relative, but if you read what I wrote next I said it in relation at least making the gap that Classic have smaller, which *is* extremely easy. 
---
&gt; the minute you make a mele class that can heal, clense, cc well, AND give them great dps ? Suddenly you have the most overpowered pvp class 
---
No, if you read my reply I actually specifically did not just say "buff hybrid dps". That is obvious to anyone that it would make them OP.
---
The things I wrote in my previous comment can be summed up to not increasing dps of hybrids, but increasing utility to where it is just as *useful* as a more "pure" dps. The problem right now is that hybrids have low dps and in return get hybrid benefits. That is fine, except the hybrid benefits are too weak to compete with classes that just have better dps. For example if you take my enh example I did not say enh needs more dmg, rather I want to give it some utility than can't just be brought by a resto. For pala I want their utility buffed as well, but similar as to shamans don't just buff Blessings - they are already strong and a holy can bring it. Embrace the ret spec for example, make some dps auras actually useful. This makes them desirable in PvE while only granting a minor boost in PvP.
---
Giving prot pala more threat won't ruin PvP. Making totems or auras stronger for some specs than other for PvE balancing won't do too much in PvP. The biggest problem right now is that hybrid utility can be brought by the healers, so no reason to bring a hybrid dps over a better dps. And then there is the prot pala problem of not having taunt and low threat for single target. All of this can easily be fixed without ruining PvP. Besides, even if some minor buff should happen in PvP, hybrid dps are generally not the top dogs in PvP either.
---
These are of course just quick thoughts to showcase the general idea, but honestly a team of devs putting some thought into it can *easily* make the hybrid tax to benefit ratio *much* better.
---
Disclaimer: I'm not actually saying I want this in Classic.
---
I'd like to see Starcraft in WoW, Protoss and Zergs are fighting on some ship that crashes in Azeroth, Protoss join Alliance, Zerg join Horde (screw another set of humans).
---
I think thanks to the streamer the hype will reach the younglings, too.
---
My wife is awesome. She fully understands my obsession and doesn't bat an eyelid if I book a week off work and refuse to do anything with her and the kids for a week. 
---
I love my wife... To add to it she'll bring food and drink to my office and do everything in the house.

Sorry to all you guys that don't have this. /Gloat
---
In an ideal world, I'd prefer WoW 2.0 as well, but it's an infinitely higher risk, both for Blizz and for players.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/b3u74p/potential_level_squish_being_seriously_discussed/
---
Basically, they are trying to float around the idea to see how people receive it right now. If they do implement it, it probably won't be until the next expansion launches, maybe pre-patch. It's nothing 100% guarantee'd yet, but I would say it's fairly safe to assume. 125+ is getting a bit ridiculous for character levels at this point.
---
My point was though, if they cap it down to say 60, that means at the end of Classic's patch cycle, which people are estimating will take around 18 months after launch, people can just transfer their classic characters over to retail and be max level. It would be an incentive for a lot of people to come back to retail after they are done playing around in classic. Which means they are unlikely to keep going with an entirely different branch of WoW and keep the community split. That would be a lot of extra work for the same sub fee.
---
I shapeshift out to cast necessry heals and innervate i believe. So i am allready oomkin. Why make that worse i reckoned.
---
Or if i ever have to taunt something who knows.
---
&gt; Practicing the optimal route will still keep you ahead of the pack
---
Yes ofc, knowing a good route will be necessary to pull ahead. The tough part tho is to try to create a route optimal for launch conditions (since it's obviously hard to simulate). 
---
Playing stress test is the closest we can come, and during the last ones you could see that getting 10 boar kills, even in a 5 man party, will require you to mostly stay in one place and wait for a respawn right in front of you. You can't grind boars to 75% of level 2 if you want to be reasonable quick. At that point people will have already dinged 3 by running back and forth to the start area to do hand in quests one by one.
---
That's mental and snakes me feel really old haha
---
Don't bother. He's one of those people who interpret examples literally and get upset over the exact numbers and completely ignore the point being made.

I agree - maybe the old blizzard would have tried this, but probably not acti-bliz

---
Private server were overtunned and so they recreated the expected experience while having wrong numbers.
---
In Classic we have the good value but the experience is, somehow, different than what we were expecting... because it feel easier ! 
---
So it may be a letdown for some players who were expecting Classic to be harder than pservers.
---
Only slam resets, the rest can be used whenever you want.
---
welp im going to have to make a playlist of the crap i listened to when I was \~16
---
We've seen a bunch of these polls by now and the results are consistent.
---
But i'm willing to bet it will shift towards what we see today on pserver as time goes by. Rogues and Hunters are very popular alts, for QoL and PvP reasons, and i also believe a good part of ppl that are rolling Warrior for the first time will change class before reaching 60. Mages are fucked tho. They'll be fighting for gear the whole lvling run.
---
You'll be oom within a minute.
---
Go resto. Go offtank. Or go another class.
---
You need way more points in the restoration tree since druids heal in raids, they have severe mana issues and can't deal damage on boss encounters.
---
I never stopped listening to these😂
---
Sure, but if a persons asks for it we can assume that it is relevant for them.
---
I didn't even raid, all I did at 60 was get my pvp set and just world pvp every day after school lol, i think the only raid I stepped into was ZG.
---
I've spent nearly every waking moment the past 2 months deciding class and faction.  And just when I'm 100% sure what I'm rolling, I think, hmm, maybe not. Ugh. I just spent some time planning my leveling routes with a UD mage, spent the time making a comprehensive list of when I should visit my class trainer and what skills to buy / not buy and still, might not play mage lol.
---
Send help pls.
---
It diminishes the value greatly when you extend the next auto dude, it’s not some “powerhouse” play style which some seem to believe
---
This set was part of why I wanted some way to change the skin of items. Especially the helm was awful. Like a shitty super hero.
---
AV is released near the end so dont assume people get that ;)
---
I love Pally in BFA (combat wise) and in Classic it seems like it is just auto attacking,  is this true?  
---
What is a standard opener or rotation in PVP with full cooldowns?
---
Ind Endgame you will have like 4-5 Rogues every Raid, so they are top DPS if you do it right.
---
I tanked everything in Arms or Fury spec, including offtanking in raids. Wyrmthalak was the one fight where I felt really squishy.
---
Like you are aleady doing regardless of classic, right?
---
Boring and uncreative is your meme. 
---
I'm going horde but here is good reasons;
---
Human have the best racial for a tank with sword mastery. If you are serious about min-max for raids or world first alliance, humans have a clear benefit.
---
Horde quest, cities and territories was rushed in production and the experience is better as alliance.
---
Paladin&gt;Shaman PVE and PVP

Slam does but nothing else, and Slam isn't even that good.

If they don’t get heals, locks have bigger problems than mages on I.e patchwerk.
---
He said good
---
If you think you will achieve that in the 48 hours of a stress test then more fool to you
---
Most play warrior because they think it will be a fun ride with big damage.
---
I doubt most that pick warrior will stick however. Always felt that warrior was the hardcore class that enjoys a butt fucking for breakfast.

---
Yeah but i’d see it more as a  “support” class then a pure healer, with this build.
---
Just theorycrafting tbh.
---
I misread your comment in the beginning. I was thinking late in the curve as late being 50-60. However, that doesn’t mean much when an above average player is going to beat an average player the majority of the time no matter the class. If anything it kind of proves it with average players not even being able to hit the power curve on the top teir pvp classes.
---
Lots of people underestimate how hard it is to level an alliance priest on a pvp server
---
You don't even need a sub for the open beta as far as I know.
---
Generally, bosses will have fewer mechanics, but those mechanics will be a lot less forgiving than in modern WoW.
---
With 8 tanks you start off with 1 tank on each boss and the 
---
remaining 4 in the safe zone. Then you rotate on 6-7 stacks (my memory is getting a bit fuzzy here).
---
Its possible to get away with only 7 tanks and even 6! But 4HM is already a pure execution fight and lowering the amount of tanks made it so you hade to be flawless. 8 tanks let you have some redundancy in case something did not go according to plan.
---
Most accurate meme from whole classic hype series .... :D
---
We're not quite sure how competitive it is yet and how some of the on hit procs work, so I'd hold my horses. Following some simulation I have seen, it might not be close to good enough, even if better than actual traditional ret.
---
i typed in my guild name and server name and found it https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Firetree_US/Classic_40-Man
---
But main tank isn't just a guild position. Its also a raid position. Or do you think all the warriors are going to be fighting over aggro instead of dpsing?
---
Ready Steady Go - Paul Okenfold / Breaking Me Down - Soil / Breaking the Habit - Linkin Park / Enter Sandman - Metallica. 
---
The list is also missing a lot of RHCP - which may not have been in many PvP videos, but i’m sure was seared into peoples memories from 04-06
---
Oh no, a strawman argument on an mmo forum.
---
There's only 500 player in the beta. All streamers. What made you think you would get in.
---
&gt; if we don't raise a fuss, it won't all get fixed
---
You think they'd just ignore a bug where a player would be **invincible** ? After all the care and love they put into merging a 2004 codebase with a modern backend, this is going to be the tipping point for them ? This is bordering on conspiracy.
---
They haven't fixed it yet because it's difficult. Squatting bugs in an evolving project is demanding, especially when they are caused by something like Spell batching.  
---
I'd suggest gathering a couple of priests in-game and testing the bug, instead of sharing non-sense on reddit.
---
100% agree to this.
---
Also, if you are afraid a guild will not let you raid as a gnome warrior, because best tanks are Night Elfes and best DMG are Human...Ask yourself these questions.
---
"Do I really want to be in a guild, that is quite litterally RACIST in a fucking fantasy world" 
---
Just have fun, find a nice social guild, with experienced people in it (i know they will exist, because i'll be playing in one) that will help the  newbs, teach you the game, and show you some raiding.
---
These guilds wont be server 1st on new content, but tbh, with current knowledge about the game, i'd expect them to clear MC/ONY/ZG/BWL weekly, and do some AQ and NAX progression.  Prob wont be doing world bosses though, as they will be camped by the "L33t HC" people
---
Maybe a bit of overkill, but not insane and that's a very nicely-priced card for gaming in general.
---
i doubt this /silly will be in the game unfortunately :(
---
Pally, 1 good end game spec,  shaman, 3. Horde warlock is super easy mode.
---
I didn't mention world first. There are many method streamers racking in thousands of views from playing classic.
---
Near the end of what? By the time the majority of players make it to 60 we will probably be in phase 3. Once AV is released a lot of people will rush for those rewards. It wont be too long before you see a ton of people with them. Also there are plenty of other good items that have similar stats. The arcanite reaper is easy to obtain and has a 3.8 speed.
---
You don't have beta. Its just for the stress test. Anyone with an active NA sub can participate.
---
You have a strong imagination.
---
How come there are shamans on the Alliance and Paladins on the Horde XD?
---
Ah the guy who goes and kill low levels and then the next second tell people who question it "you are the type of person who can't let others have fun and enjoy themselves." And I got banned before I could even reply to it too.
---
a win - win situation!  Young people can try it and the ones that like it stay and enrich the community and those who dislike it quit so they don't bother us.
---
R1 flash of light costs 35 Mana?
---
You would make a great beta tester
---
Ahh yes, those days when you where laughing in guild chat about people LFM for Ony Pugs... knowing they would never kill her...
---
Fast forward a couple of months "Guild Ony run? M8, i've already pugged her on my 3 chars this reset"
---
Really? From guides ive read etc priests are ranked as one of the easier classes to level. Priests are also great at pvp with fears, MC etc.
---
Some look better, some look worse. But the main problem I have is you are forced to use the new ones now. So I'm shit out of luck on my female NE because I hate the new model.
---
You didn't answer my question. I raided with a top 70 world guild for most of MoP and finished off MoP with a top 5 world guild and half way into Warlords. I competed at the Blizzcon raid race as well. 
---
A good spelladin (Ret Paladin stacking spell power) will not be carried by anyone. They will out dps all but the best and most geared Warriors, Rogues and Mages in your group. 
---
Raids in vanilla are piss easy dude, even Naxx. The difficulty comes in farming consumables, some gear restraints for certain fights (like 4 horsemen) and keeping a 40 man raid together for a long period of time. The DPS checks will be a breeze and so will the mechanics.
---
Yeah as shit as BFA is, the gap in performance from even the top specs all the way to the bottom is nowhere near as massive as it is in classic. 
---
Don't take that to mean that BFA balance and class design is perfect or anything, but the balance sure as shit IS better.
---
I know this, but as already mentioned on another post this doesn't show the difference between Horde / Alliance and EU / US. 
---
For example your link shows 7.40% shamans and 7.16% Paladins because they just mixed up Horde and Alliance. This is on every poll and that's why I made it a bit different :-)
---
&gt; Every dps spec could have the same amount of utility, but the utility itself can be different. E.g. a feral druid has a party wide buff vs. a rogue with hemorage. Both are substantially different from one another, but could be equally strong.
---
If the many-option-class (Feral) and the single-option class (Rogue) have the same DPS and equally useful buffs/debuffs, then you're still putting Rogues in a bad position.  That's especially the case for Feral in particular which could fill in as an offtank if you give him the good gear instead of the Rogue.
---
I think that utility is the perfect way to get around this and to also add a lot more interesting abilities into the game.
---
This looks like an experiment to see what it's like and let people know what they find.
---
The only difference a higher level makes is you're less likely to be spotted by mobs while in stealth.
---
It'll still take the same amount of time to go around and pickpocket all NPCs, open boxes and sell stuff.
---
I'm honestly glad this is being done. It'd be nice to have somewhere where the info for each instance is collected so we can compare if needed. Sometimes it's just nice to look into this kind of thing even if there isn't much value in it.
---
Jester race is a flawless album. Hard to beat a bit of colony and clayman as well 😁

I think you really need Omen of Clarity as an oomkin. When you're OOM, you autoattack and can do at least some casts.
---
I have a 8700k RTX 2070 and during the AV test I didn’t dip below my RR @240.

Gorrilaz - demon days album was the jam back in vanilla/bc and the prodigy

Heal rank 2, learned at 22 i believe, is what I used the most

Yep, you can basically spam it indefinitely.

I think it shows that we will have retards on horde and on alliance :D
---
South Park was doing episodes about YouTubers (pewdiepie) years ago. Pretty sure most people in South Park's audience are aware of what streamers are... it's FAR from a niche thing these days.
---
What? You think your going to play elemental or enhancement?! You have way more chance as a ret pally. You have no value except to drop a couple totem and you can do this as a healer without being a complete drag on the raid. Paladin have some little value with retribution.
---
Your going to have to explain this one.
---
Vanilla WoW is actually about whatever you want it to be about. And that can be raiding. Or it can be something totally different.
---
Nothing wrong with minmaxing for raiding, new players or old. There is a lot to do out there though.
---
You've been involved in past discussion about clusters and know that they are a cluster of segments that share a name pool so that they can be merged as smoothly as possible.
---
We're discussing the melee hit cap - for which you can absolutely eliminate all chances of missing. Casters have a 1% chance that they cannot cap, but melee can. Melee is still subject to dodges and parries though.  
---
    
---
Also I was wrong in the comment you replied to, yes the 5 extra weapon skill removes the 1% penalty that comes from there being a 10+ skill difference between the attacker's weapon skill and the defender's defense skill, but it also impacts the regular hit cap calculation and lowers your "normal" chance to miss from 8% to 6%
---
Fuck yes we did. For a while it was super popular in my circle of friends.
---
Do you really need a sub for the open beta? I can log in the client.
---
Man I'd love that. 
---
I would also LOVE, (I know I'll get downvoted to hell and most people won't like) to have servers named after REAL VANILLA LEGENDS:
---
Swiftie, Vurtne, Grim, Niar and many many others. Even named after FAMOUS GUILDS: Nihilum, Death and Taxes... It would be awesome as fuck.
---
That's because it allows you to add pretty much everything to the game, including shaders.
---
&gt;I dont think people understands how useless it is to post about \~\~layering\~\~ loot trading every day.
---
Blizzard makes mistakes. And they also listen. The hope is that the player base bands together and stands up for themselves.
---
Can you explain how the +1 system works?
---
Same here! I have two hard goals:

* Paladin horse at level 40! (and the epic mount at 60)
---
* Lightforge armour!

Other than that, I just want to enjoy myself, meet people and enjoy the game at a comfortable pace. I loved being a paladin healer in dungeons and battlegrounds back in vanilla, so that's what I will do this time as well. If I get invited to some raids - great, but really not that important to me.
---
Beautiful rant, 100% correct. Too many try hards thinking they have to min/max but 90% of them will join casual guilds anyway.
---
Remember to not leave your bicycle unattended.
---
But being the best dps on meters is how some people have fun.
---
Oh man that questline was hard!
---
I split those two points up on purpose (utility vs respecing), to look at them individually. You throwing them back together is not helping.
---
Again: both points warrant a reduction in dps. But the ability to respec is not as relevant because within an encounter, you have to choose one (and only one) role. So the fact that you can play as something else later is irrelevant in that specific encounter. Anyways, I mostly agreed with your prior arguments, but the numbers are way off, making certain specs straight up unbalanced/unviable.
---
Here's my advise to you cause I'm doing the same. First I'd say rush anger management. It has a hidden not too well known effect that says you get 1 rage per 3 sec and is a warriors best talent. https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/A-AwQAAA
---
Then I would quickly go n get last stand and ONE in improved shield block since further upgrades only increase duration. With an attack timer you can manage to block two attacks from a boss with timing.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/A-AwQAAC5wU
---
Then I would go 3 defiance - 3 sunder armor - 2 defiance - 2 defiance - 2 toughness - 5 one hand specilizaton - shield slam - 3 parry - 3 cruelty
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AvDBASQF_xTwE0A
---
This is the build I'll be going for.
---
I'm quite sure they will be in the actual game, though it suggests that maybe a lot of super casual players like hunter and rogue - I can't blame them.
---
Currently trying to get out of my best friends wedding which is the following weekend from launch...
---
Help?
---
And gross misuse of hyperbole only serves to weaken your position, friend.
---
Also, System Of A Down. Remember grinding for HotW cloak at LAN with their music (and Disturbed) basically on repeat all week. Still get the chills thinking about those never-dropping Larval Acids.
---
You have a short wife.
---
Korn, slipknot, limpbizkit, disturbed, killswitch engage, static x, rise against, offspring, 2 pac, NWA, we'll just say gangster rap. Linkin Park, system of a down, trance, techno, hardstyles. A few others thrown into the mix on shuffle. 
---
I cannot wait to jam again.
---
Yeah i thought of that aswell and then use a caster dagger for its attack speed lol
---
It doesnt matter how good the blocks look, they are still blocks. And i would bet my ass that at least 100M out of the 170M people who bought Minecraft never used anything like that.
---
Autoattack a boss that cleaves with no avoidance talents? 
---
Seems painful.
---
&gt;  I think we may see a lot of younger folks try to solo their way through the game and have worse experiences for it.
---
Either this, or the game will break them and force them to team up if they really want to succeed. Of course, some may give up before even reaching the point where they care to succeed
---
Absolutely don't spec prot while leveling unless you're going to level purely through dungeons or something like that. Any spec warrior with a 1h and shield will still be perfectly capable of tanking all 5mans pre-60!
---
I’m going to play hunter.
---
I genuinely feel bad for you, son
---
Yeah pretty much half of the Sinner album is a must.
---
Think I’ll have to accept the inevitable and role 2 chars, warrior and priest or lock.
---
I played lock in tbc and liked it but the thought of soul shard farming drains me. How are both classes when compared in pvp? Part of me wants to relive the drake dog days but knowing i won’t have much chance against Rogues and warriors without a soul link build sounds pretty tough and a boring play style compared to being a priest.
---
2 handed wind fury shaman reporting for duty!   
---
I know I'll suck and be RNG heavy, but By god it'll be glorious.
---
How do I ignore a user ?
---
People will try to reserve loot for 5mans etc but that's about as inconvenient as it will get. If you're playing with friends then focus on making that work out and enjoy it for that!
---
You should also divide it between pvp/ pve servers
---
I have a feeling a higher percentage of the population will be hitting 60 than when vanilla was out tbh.
---
Hell will be unleashed on those lazy peons when thousands of orcs and trolls kick them into oblivion on launch day...
---
Does Seal of Command Double dip from Vengeance ?
---
Started playing in 2006, 10,000 days from TOOL had just come out so I was blasting that for a month or 2 while leveling. Tools new album is supposed to drop 2 days before classic is released, Fuckin perfect.
---
Ow and im afraid I Might be out of range for my aura when that happens so mages dont get the crit..
---
I thought that, tried a private server, and was instantly hooked all over again.
---
I mean, for a dungeon... maybe, it could work, in a raid setting? You’ll be out of mana way too fast, way too often to be able to contribute much. It’s why Balance is terrible for raiding. 
---
It’s also a decent pvp spec.
---
Added ;) i'll add more after work
---
Spawn OST
---
&gt;  I raided with a top 70 world guild for most of MoP and finished off MoP with a top 5 world guild and half way into Warlords
---
Congrats.
---
You'll still be a scrubnub on a ret pally, dealing shit dps, needing people to carry you, because ret is an inefficient, unviable memespec. By all means, enjoy the spec and the greasing of palms to make people do the work for you.
---
A casual guild will have no problem raiding with a boomkin. You can clear MC with 20 man. Don't expect to get to naxxramas. I read somewhere in vanilla, US servers, only 23 guild killed last boss.
---
That's probably more reflective of how many Asian players saw the poll.
---
This would be unusual considering the stress test isn't open yet. If you mean you can open the Classic WoW client, that makes sense. Anyone who downloaded it can.
---
But when you put it in your account credentials on the log in screen it ought to say "Can't find that account".
---
That's what I'm planning to do next :-)
---
😆 good luck seeing a sacred charge that shit is rare
---
You kinda disproved your own point bro. People don't want to invest 200+ hours into something that while, yes, they enjoy the gameplay of a class, they can't get into a raid or don't enjoy their roll in a raid.
---
I understand it's annoying that everyone wants to be a warr/mage/rogue/priest but that was simply what the game is. Sure you may see a random enhance sham or feral druid but people want to know what they're getting into before investing a bunch of time.
---
The people saying that really mean a 20/31/0 MM spec instead of a 2/31/18 MM spec. Bestial Wrath won't help you in MC as much as Trueshot Aura.
---
Mann i was a terrible boomkin in classic, became decent in tbc. 
---
But I was also much younger, there has to be a way to make it work.
---
I reckoned improved buffs make people happy lol
---
From my experience younger players are usually way more comfortable with having to be a little patient than older ones.
---
OMG Barrens is acting like the end of a giant funnel where all of Horde will pass through o.O
---
LOL
---
And I work at the energy department with the same role as you. Cash for leveling is fantastic.  
---
Same to you!
---
Nope, I log in and see the server list.
---
Against spriest they are.  Even with gear.  No cloak.
---
Im pretty sure there is a way to make it viable somehow in a guild which clears bosses in a minute, but for progress i think it‘s notthe kind of thing you should go to a raid, sure if you farm the consumes, manapots and runes, you can pull it off and also play it on a casual guild. Overall comittment tops class viability 🙃
---
I'm not a WL player, what is the right way ? Seduce is broken by WOTF too.
---
What do you do when a melee is sitting on you and your terror spell (forgot the name) is on CD ?
---
lmao is arcane that dogshit?
---
Really can't understand this decision by Blizz back in the days. Every troll tribe you meet in the game has warlocks, but we can't roll none.
---
&gt; I know it’s always been that way 
---
In real vanilla alliance was more populated. In the following expansions (I think BC too, but not sure) the horde was always more populated. 
---
On retail especially there is a massive horde population advantage.
---
Did you buy her from her father for a hundred goats or two camels?
---
My understanding is that Forsaken are usually 45-50% of the total horde population. Orc + Troll is probably around 30-35% together, with the last 15-20% being Tauren
---
Priest/Warr is such an insane duo that you can and should get away with being full dps specs if you want to. Just have a shield and 1h for if you need to tank and absolutely let her go full shadow while leveling!
---
More Warlocks than Rogues? No way José.
---
That's what Warriors like to think. In reality, it is a very boring class that will have the average level of difficulty while leveling but considering the other challenges they face they think it's the hardest thing ever.
---
Yes, when I select "World of Warcraft: Classic" and hit play in the Blizzard Launcher, I too see a realm list. All of which are listed as offline because the stress test isn't live.
---
Now, hit the "cancel" button on the realm list and try to actually log in to the client. You haven't actually logged in, you've just opened the WoW Classic client.
---
You should play hunter then.
---
Yeah I really like the alliance/horde split so you actually get paladins and shamans around where they should be.
---
1v1 warrior is about charging them before they start kiting you, as a rule of thumb.
---
But then you get bearform @10 with that 1 single special attack button which you can almost spam and removes about 30% of a mob's hitpoints every time. Druid lvl 10-11-12 goes by really fast (and then the scaling sets in until you get kitty form)
---
Lot of locks on horde side. I think it’s due to a reddit bias for locks because everyone talks about how great they are at pvp.
---
Locks are fantastic but like any other vanilla class they have drawbacks.
---
Locks are super strong and have lots of viable builds. But one common factor is their lack of mobility, and this might not be a big deal to some, however it limits the class a bit.
---
Compared to mages, mages can force a fight using their mobility. If someone sees a lock, and tries to run, there is not much a lock can do to stop them. Sometimes playing a lock is frustrating because you are very strong but a bit slow and unable to force fights because of your lack of mobility.
---
I’m not looking to be in a top 50 guild mind you, and id rather be a hard working owl man then a lazy mage so who knows I Might get lucky
---
hahaha greatest comment today!
---
I only tanked when I played warrior, but it became very nice when moving around while fighting too. It gives you a good idea of when you need to face the mobs, like.. harmstring and run, then move in close when the timer hits.
---
Even seeing a random sampling of Horde/Alliance still at 50% is really cool. Both factions really do cater to a certain part of the playerbase.
---
I use this as well. Even still I haven't been able to get close to 2 hours.  Still 3 hours is much better than I used to do. I think my first casual 1-10 was like 5 hours
---
Lock gets better with gear in PvP and has diverse specs. SL feels different to deep Affliction and MUCH different than Destro. That being said, you're a damage dealer at the end of the day. As a priest, you can play a healer, DPS and some weird hybrid with deep Disc in BGs, so you have a bit more variance imo. I'm going to roll Priest I think, so I might be biased, but I think they're more fun to play in PvP since you have more options in any given situation.
---
Got me through vanilla
---
&gt; two fucking motherfuckers are going at it. 
---
Right.
---
That's some prime stupid right there.
---
Yeah sure, i‘m going to lead a guild, the raid roster i made leaves about 4-5 spots open to take whatever. It‘s not going to be hardcore, so i rly want the ppl to have a good time as long as we clear the content, everyone is free also to play the „meme“ speccs on those few spots.
---
My friends are considering rolling a paladin, I'm currently bombarding him with retri paladin memes, more of this please!
---
This. Or classic devs. Would be cool to play on the Metzen or Kern realms.
---
&gt; Most play warrior because they think it will be a fun ride with big damage.
---
Well it is. You just run the risk of dying very often if you're not careful.
---
Among the demographic, no, because people realize how essential Shaman are for raiding. In reality they probably won't be quite as popular.
---
Is holy DPS viable for leveling?
---
The hype will be so real that most of em, it will be their first experience with a MMO. It was first on Twitch for more than two weeks. You can't expect them to like the long grind coming from fortnite or league of legends.
---
There will be some power saving options. Like Nvidia app lists game settings for AC and battery power and the battery ones are lower to use less power on the GPU. Not sure how AMD handles it.
---
Nah fam. Warriors are the hardest to level and not really an easy class. You keep telling yourself that though but Google and many will tell you that warriors are harder than your average class.
---
Eye of the tiger, no?
---
Go pick some apples and kill a bug up top that pose absolutely no threat.
---
interesting, some people have way more servers.
---
Are you Oceanic by any chance /u/SignalDistrict
---
Spell batching is dynamic between 0-400ms, it depends on server load etc. (average was 200ms back then.)
---
Casting spells on yourself has no spell batching, it's only when you use abilities on other units.
---
Wow is about wow.
---
I'm Quite pleased with how even it is for both Factions.
---
Also holy moly the amount of shamans!
---
You know it! Good song, and I still remember watching his rant about Blood Elves being added to the game haha.
---
Doesn't do this. I did asked a GM to find my old account and link it. The find your old friends add. Maybe that's it.
---
People did this in vanilla. They do it on private servers. They did it in BC, Wrath, Cata, etc. It has been done in every single iteration of the game.
---
Hell, people will boost people through Dead Mines for a few gold.
---
Priest/Lock is really your individual choice. But priest gives you the opportunity to have a save spot in a raid and also have some fun over all (mind controlling Scarlet NPCs in Strat Live, etc). And a good shadow priest can be a nightmare to fight against in PVP.
---
I will probably roll the same combo, warrior main and priest alt. I will gear the warrior and use the priest either for when we need a healer or will try DM lasher farming with an AOE holy build for gold. While I level my warrior, the priest will just wait in a capital city and receive mail from the warrior. So I will probably get gathering professions on my warrior (because I will be out in the world and find materials) and the priest will have crafting professions.
---
It was done late in vanilla by top guilds for raids they didn’t need.  
---
Lack of an achievement system will eliminate most boosts and paid runs.  
---
I agree with OP, when selling runs/rating became the norm it is part of what killed retail.
---
WoW 2 would be cool but I just do not trust the current Blizzard to pull it off.
---
Yes please! And rise against

Here’s what it’s like playing an Alliance Warlock:
---
https://youtube.com/watch?v=VRS8dRDW7wg
---
Breaking Benjamin - Blow me Away
---
Well it doesn’t really matter either way. When horde racials for improved dps trump alliance hit cap racials.
---
"Somewhat unrelated: which do you think would do better, a raid made up entirely of paladins or one made up entirely of druids?"
---
Depends on the encounter I would say. Paladins would be screwed with raidwide curses while druids have the same going for them with magical debuffs. While the druids have the better tank for most situations the paladins will have the edge in healing. 
---
DPS wise it depends. If crowd pummeler meta works and the whole raid applies that except for a few boomkins they will have the advantage in damage. The druids can also switch between melee and ranged DPS depending on encounter and have 40 battlerezzes invalidating a lot of encounter mechanics or player errors. 
---
All in all I would say the advantage goes to druids if they really really try as hard as possible.
---
Damm, now I want to make a Deus Vult Series. 40 Paladins vs. everything.
---
That’s your opinion, i have always been a high rated arena player and the skill gap was the highest in WotLK. When they changed CC casting time from 1.5 to 2.0 seconds (sheep/fear/etc.) and stole the abilities from the classes they also took the skill gap out. It felt like going from 60+ keybinds to below 30 in MoP. When I came back in Legion I legit wondered where all my abilities are. No skill gap in PvP anymore so yeah.
---
Jesus Alliance are that afraid of Will of the Forsaken?  Look at the Warlock split
---
&gt;Doesn't do that.
---
Doesn't do what?
---
And even then, they still are among the most popular level 60s, so all in all that's still quite a lot of people that stickied to warrior.
---
Edgy against the flow. The uniq one out of the uniqs elohel
---
Oh what I would give to be new to wow again and not having experienced or seen the world before.
---
That's why my main focus will be on pvp. 
---
I'll do dungeons and raids but I'm 100% expecting all raids to be cleared within 1-3 hours. It is insane to think that people used to raid 5 days a week for 4-5 hours. I recently saw pve videos from vanilla and pservers. It looks like LFR. No kidding. Hardly any movement required or any kind of mechanics that you see in m+ today.
---
Raids will fill out a very small portion of your play time unless you only raid log.
---
Upvoted for... you know... being actually informative...
---
Hunters are absolutely terrible DPS in patch 1.12.1 compared to other classes.
---
Godspeed
---
When someone gets a piece of loot he gets a +1. If you have a +1 you cannot win rolls again unless everyone who rolls also has +1. Usually this resets at last or second last boss since those bosses have really good loot compared to the others.
---
&gt;     It takes like like 7-12 days for most people to reach 60.
---
7-12 days, really? Most people? I think not.
---
You should still love them. They're still going strong.
---
It would probably cause quite a bit of faction imbalance. As a lot of servers are known on retail to be entirely dominated by one faction. No alliance would roll on Tarren Mill EU for example.
---
It has filters on the side, so you can easily see horde or alliance class breakdowns, or EU NA breakdowns and any other combination you can imagine as well.
---
Sorry, but you clearly don't have any raid experience worth even mentioning considering you elected not to share. You are also completely clueless about Spelladin builds that will not be carried by anyone. You're simply parroting things that other people told you.
---
here's the one I made from scratch for classic
---

---
I can absolutely understand game developers who feel disheartened that less than 1% of all players saw the content they made tho. Both sides of the argument have some merit. It’s a difficult issue.
---
How is it even possible alliance / horde ratio is so close to 50 / 50 % overall in wow history? Is it simply just because they made both of the factions so equally interesting? Of course there are servers with unbalanced horde to alliance ratio, but still counting all realms it should be close to 50 / 50 %.
---
I'd love to go back and play with my original 5 man group. Best times from 1 to 60. Don't play at all now . Man I miss those guys.
---
You mean they literally told us it *wasn't* a possibility?
---
Pallies are more cancer than shamans in PVP for hunters. They also have better buffs for you than shamans do
---
People often realise their mistake when called upon to tank.
---
Tanking requires a special kind of personality. Most people simply dont like it.
---
Just a reminder, game releases in America on Monday at 3pm, not that Tuesday.
---
Yoooo what the fuck was that part!?!?
---
10 realms namned Classic Realm "X" all offline (none of them RP-PvP) 
---
If I had to guess this is laying the outline for release and 10 realms is in my opinion really good as it will most likely mean 0 "dead" realms after launch month.
---
I am a little sad to see PLAY button not also playing a sound like it used to and that its still the lifeless blue but hey :)
---
7-12 days /played is a pretty decent range. Even when I first played WoW it took me 13 days /played to reach level 60. Its not unreasonable.
---
The ping isn’t as bad as you would think. I didn’t notice a difference myself.
---
I see Asomogolds dumb face, i hide post.
---
Our Guild currently is at 100 Members, 5 Rogues, 3 Hunters
---
I never healed in my entire life, but shaman is so appealing. If I try to heal in retail, can i get an approximate feel for what it is?
---
I feel like Rogues are going to be a huge sleeper class in Classic. They're totally undervalued by the talking heads that /r/classicwow follows. IIRC they were actually a lot higher on DPS meters than you typically see on pservers, so I'm wondering if there are some more mechanical disparities that are exposed by Classic WoW.
---
&gt;Will it also attract younger players
---
No, it will mostly attract people who played vanilla back in the day. Secondarily it will attract any WoW players. And there are almost no young people playing WoW any more.
---
Hope they choose the same server names so people could join the same server and find old friends
---
I actually quit vanilla when BWL was released because I got the feeling the game was becoming an endless gear grind and 5-10 mans were being neglected. Also never liked BGs
---
we had IgnoreMore addon in vanilla.  I am sure something like that will  be made
---
Bro, can you put it into pie chart, please? This way we'll get an overview way quicker. Great job, thank you.
---
Why is that? Hunter is the worst DPS class and you only need 2 of them in any given 40man raid.
---
I swear, I heard josh say on his stream that he wanted to go for world first
---
I played Warlock on retrowow for quite a lot so i was really good at warlock
---
But the only spec i played was destro and im afraid i wont be as good at afflicion compared to destro.
---
So my question is,how is warlock at pvp with the sl build or whatever,pvp being world pvp?
---
Also is destro viable for raiding at all?
---
Thanks
---
Farming alt/gold maker. My main had tailoring/enchanting(I was guild enchanter) although you can make money by spending hours spamming chat to do peoples enchant's it's pretty boring. You will have to farm mats for resistance gear/potions etc, you can buy them from AH but you will be very poor very quickly.
---
Anything that has a cast time will reset the swing timer. Using instant cast spells and abilities won't.
---
What time will the stress test be AUS time?
---
No, that's not why, lol.
---
Good choice! Pew pew pew
---
57 people are about to be seriously dissapointed
---
Yes. Shoving a red hot poker up the ass of someone who does this.
---
There's a route in BRD where you also check for a  rare mob that drops a rare enchanting recipe. I don't know what the drop rates will be like in Classic but taking this route yields a stable base gold/hour rate and if you get the recipe you get a huge bonus on top.
---
Only if the ability has a cast time. Something instant like say Earth Shock won't reset your swing timer to 0.
---
Why is horde warlock super easy mode ?
---
I honestly don't think we need an overarching story line. We just need a world to be adventurers in.
---
I always loved having quests that took you around the world with different zones having their own problems that NPCs need help with.
---
That's all I really want. A MMO focused on the adventure.
---
In PvP you will likely have to decide between cleansing something or extra damage. If you play it correct you won't have a free GCD. In PvE it would have changed the early meta away from warriors to paladins and made paladins even more broken for PvE purposes. 
---
While I would have handed in my hearthstone for it as a paladin I can understand why it was removed.
---
Agreed.  I played through Vanilla the first time with a Tauren Hunter...a fucking Tauren!  I knew no better.  I didnt know that Trolls got 7 more base agility and a much better racial.  And ya know what? It didnt matter.  I found a decent guild, raided through most content, made friends, enjoyed the game and never looked back.  Just play what you want and you will be happy!
---
Let's say [1.000.000.000](https://1.000.000.000) to stay realistic
---
It has downsides but it's plausible, downsides being not your timezone and higher ping.
---
You could do most of the content with a couple of unconventional specs back then. We had an Oomkin, we had a Protadin, Shadow Priest, even a couple of non-Dwarf Priests and so on, and we did every raid up to and including Naxx just fine with a semi-casual schedule. Raids were more about coordination and cooperation. Playing optimal specs/races will only lower the gear or skill thresholds a bit, it's not as if you absolutely needed to be that race or spec for the most part.
---
It's not a very good read fyi. I sometimes do as I'm travelling, and it's very rare you come across something actually interesting written in the quest text.
---
&gt; You'll be oom within a minute.
---
I mean, a nuclear explosion is also "over" in a minute.
---
The question is what can you do in that minute
---
Dopamine
---
The correct answer here is always FOR THE HORDE
---
Youtube, instragram, twitter.  These are main stream.  Twitch is not.  99% of youtubes userbase has no idea you can even stream on the platform.  They just use it for videos.
---
Twitch is still very niche. You survey 100 people on the street and nearly all of them will know what youtube is.  Twitch?  I'd be surprised if even a dozen did.
---
 [Oh god this instantly reminded me of the arcane mage memes from like wrath and cata, like this one.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ISsOjfHgtws)
---
It really takes about 30 mins to grab the buffs. Sometimes you do it day before, if you know you won't have time, but doing it like 1 hour before raid is fine.
---
Amount of time saved will depend on guild, but commonly hardcore guilds will clear both MC and BWL in under 1 hour, while casuals will struggle to clear it in 1 raid day (about 4 hours).
---
For me Sum 41 All Killer No Filler, Linkin Park Hybrid Theory, Eminems Eminem show and Blink 182 Mark Tom and Travis Show as well as Take Off Your Pants and Jacket.  Those were my gaming James of late 90s and early 2000s through Runescape Classic and WoW.
---
Many people don’t give a shit about the best gear and just wanna have fun. And that’s perfectly realistic. There will be many people in battlegrounds who are the same, so you won’t get crushed *all* the time. 
---
The levelling experience in retail is shit, the scaling makes it so you never feel like you’re getting stronger or progressing. Raids on the other hand are much more difficult in retail, so go play retail if you only wanna raid.
---
POLLUTION BURNS MY TONGUE
---
How does that make any sense 😅
---
A lot of Korn, Static-x, Rammstein and HipHop
---
Wait this guy doesn't have the beta? Where does he get the info from?
---
I think hardcore players are worried that there will be too many rogues. May as well play a warrior that can also tank if needed while still doing the same dps as a rogue.
---
Anyone created a classic playlist for spotify yet?
---
On alliance you have to deal with undead using WotF and then having 30 seconds to wail on you, its not pretty.
---
if you were in americas wanting to play in euro server maybe i would understand this nonsense
---
After *ten* times you've already got one of everything at max level.
---
But thats another thing about classic; you're not *supposed* to have one of every class at max level. You take the journey on your main, and it's epic. You maybe level one or two alts to max to try out different roles and professions, and maybe you take a different route through the zones  second time, use a guide the third time because you want to speed up the process a bit.
---
After that, an individual might want to be able to just pay ten bucks for a fourth max level character, but when you put boosts in the game suddenly nobody has to take the journey, and then the people who didn't do it want the rest of the goodies to just come to them. That's how you end up with welfare epics, LFD, LFR being so easy you could have your cat jump around on the keyboard and win, etc.
---
Then you've got BfA.
---
I mean there was already horrendous faction imbalance on my server originally it is was 5:1.
---
No thanks. Sci-fi really doesn't lead itself to RPG settings.
---
How about World of Diablo instead. And keep the camera angle.
---
Hunters are not "absolutely terrible DPS", even in 1.12.1. Their DPS during MC/BWL is more than fine and even competitive. Then they start dropping lower over time. Sure, if you compare their Naxx DPS to other classes they're absolutely terrible, but even in current days, this will only affect a marginal portion of the playerbase some time in the distant future.
---
There’s probably something to be said about knowing the existing meta before going into a fresh launch. I think a lot of people will try new classes, either out of interest or to not repeat painful grouping due to class overabundance. My theory anyways.
---
My plan is to not be an altaholic.  Takes too long to level and you require so much preparation to min/max a character I don't have time for more than 1
---
Aerie Peak called it VC
---
When does the stress test start?
---
I like how in Diablo 3 the set bonuses usually increase the damage of some spell by like 15,000%. They should bring that to WoW :)
---
Hated those, they're movies about walking.
---
Correction. You will be able to make 3 character TOTAL, not 3 per server. So you can reserve exactly 3 names; not 50.

My friend used to call me after school and say "hey I've got a quest to talk to some guy in ironforge, can you do that part for me?" and I'd log inti his account, do that step, and leave him outside the city.
---
His PC just couldn't handle ironforge
---
How does it feel knowing a horde player will beat you?
---
Know what else is painful? Playing a hybrid class spec'd as a ranged DPS that cannot fulfill it's role due to its spells causing it to go OOM substantially faster compared to other dedicated ranged DPS.
---

No real queston, I'd just love to see your vods.

Speedrunning is something I always enjoy watching.

Looks like that’s driven by Horde side. People apparently want to play orc warlock for that pvp goodness.

Indeed I am.

If we’re talking pugs, most groups will take whatever they can get. If you’ve been looking for a last dps for Scarlet Monastery for the past 30 min and a kitty dps wants to join, are you gonna decline him? Fuck no.

Who cares about optimal performance in 5 mans anyway, lol. Especially during levelling. As long as you’re not wiping all the time people won’t give a shit what spec you are.

Back in vanilla my buddy and I did this to farm for gold at 40 to afford our mounts. Was a good way to chill and farm after getting bored with questing.
---
Yeah that's what I heard, it's the route to the bar right? I played paladin during the vanilla, but this time I am going rogue and that is the primary farm method I heard.
---
We both fuck mothers and we are pro at it.
---
&gt;sausage fest
---
the fuck does that have to do with anything?
---
The speed running community is pretty inclusive - we are all very competitive but support each other. So I’ll feel fine if that happens, likely I will know who it is
---
Not sure if this is sarcasm, but a pie chart definitely takes the eye longer to asses relative rankings.

I'd have to say a majority of non-raiding priests I knew ended up with this robe.
---
thx
---
You can find me on twitch, alenya11 👍
---
I don’t keep VODS over level 30 to keep the route a little bit protected but my schedule for streaming is there
---
I agree with this post. After the pre-bis phase it’s true hunters slowly start going down in the dps meters but that shouldn’t mean how much damage you do is how much you enjoy the class. 
---
It’s going to suck to see an influx of the retail mentality of people chasing damage meters. Besides, if they ever do release tbc servers hunters will be in a good spot. I’m sure druids would be happy too.
---
&gt;Vanilla WoW is a slow and deep experience.
---
...not really, no
---
What pet are you gonna use?
---
I'm  pretty sure rogues and hunters can't  read or write. It's  safe  to bet  there will be many paste eating rogues and hunters.
---
You are asking someone who gave up on his Warrior quickly after reaching Level 60 out of frustration about how I would just die to basically everyone else in PvP and who's highest Rogue was Level 41 on whether you should play Warrior or Rogue. Just saying. :D
---
My assumption on Rogue being less frustrating than Warrior is based on no real experience. I just don't think it can be even worse.
---
My other 60s, the Hunter, Druid and Mage all were significantly less frustrating in PvP than the Warrior.
---
This is really overstated. All those mobs on the way to quest give you XP, so win win. Warriors can at times take two mobs, even three. There's generally a spot for you to res, even if mobs respawned. Warrior requires more attention than other classes and is much slower to level, and mistakes are punished, but then when you need a tank for dungeons you have one. :P
---
Generally, Charge beats Mage because they like to start attacking from far away with non-instant cast spells.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
No will of the forsaken to contend with... in pve alliance locks are actually easier because of blessing of salv... my thinking is lots of people who enjoy lock class fantasy also like undead as a race. And blasting linkin park while they pwn noobs or something like that.
---
Will not be the same, but should give a good feel of how it is to pay attention to your group / raid instead
---
There's a huge QoL difference between them, though. Warriors need to spend a lot more gold on crafted gear and consumables to stay competitive. On the opposite end, Rogues have a lot easier time farming gold, and don't need to respec for casual PvP.
---
STILL undecided between Tauren and Night Elf Druid. 
---
I reckon I prefer Tauren individually, and like Warstomp more. However I still like Night Elf and prefer their animal forms. Horde looks better for PvE for me and Alliance for PvE.
---
Try the 4 Horsemen...
---
I think it started out very balanced at vanilla launch. But all migrations and stuff to new realms quickly killed that for some servers. Then it also changes slowly over the years. And then they made it so you could buy server transfers, and that made all the initially only imbalanced servers turn into 99% one-sided. At least on EU nowadays most servers are 90% or more one faction. There are a few clinging on with roughly 50-50, but other than that it's usually completely one sided.
---
you are thinking of pserv content release, most will have reached lvl 60 before or at the start of phase 2.
---
Keep in mind that the devs have often commented on how they want it to be at a pace that even newbies can access which even led to choices such as no armorless mounts.
---
Arc Reaper is extremely pricy tho so i wouldnt call it "easy". Eitherway lets wait &amp; see :)
---
It will happen.  A lot of guilds when doing MC only for legendaries or BWL for a couple specific items would reserve them and invite paying people to get the other items.
---
We also sold onyxia kills so people could complete the quest for that tanking sword etc.
---
I had the exact same issue with Ironforge. After 12 months of scrimping and saving I built a new PC and got 20fps in IF at peak teams. Felt like a god!
---
if shamans wearing male do pallys then wearing female?
---
AV is out in phase 2 though
---
I feel like nothing is allowed here. All question threads are downvoted for some reason. I guess all you can post here are memes, drawings or screenshots of your old character.
---
There were no migrations to our server ever because it was highly populated, and it remained massively imbalanced for the entire of Vanilla and TBC.
---
Shamans are good group healers, due to chain heal. Paladins are like whack-a-mole. Priests are the most versatile. Druid healing can be easy with their HOTs.
---
But the basic mechanic applies to all of the classes: select target, big heal on big damage, otherwise downranked heals on usual damage. Shaman will be usefull, when there is mass AOE damage to the group. But these are the minority of the overall dungeon / raid fights. So if they appeal to you, why the fuck not?

---
Can I ask why one would do this, when its all but assured that account sharers working in shifts will 100% get server firsts on every realm. 
---
I actually do have real questions.
---
1. What would you say is an average casual (no optimized pathing, no joanas, etc) 1-10 time?
---
2. Do you have any general advice for people trying to level faster. I've been trying to get my times down. I see people who can do 1-10 in 2 hours or less, they hit level 30 in 24 hours. My 1-10 times are 3 hours and and my 1-30 time was like 35 hours.
---
3. Why is Duskwood largely skipped by most people? Is there something particularly bad about this zone, or are other zones just amazing in comparison?
---
4. Any advice for players trying to level quickly on a PvP server? I know a lot of people want to get ahead of the pack so to speak to avoid ever being ganked by level 60's.
---

When my Hunter was OOM I just continued fighting without using Mana for 2 or 3 Mobs. Maybe swapping gear would mathematically be more efficient but then again I wouldn't have liked what that does to my inventory-space.
---
What open beta?
---
Quick question, but will classic support 1440p?
---
I am not even sure why you are being downvoted. Gold farmers will be back and the only solution that has ever worked for Blizzard was to add tokens.
---
Same Here got a little Setup to Stand Up a while it helps me
---
Have the numbers been crunched enough? Any news whether dungeon grinding with a staple group and no downtime is actually on par with questing or no?
---
Mostly because of PvP, as Hordlock you don't have to fight against Tremor Totem and Will of the Forseken.
---
Yes there is Fearward, but that's not as impacktfull.
---
I didn't play classic but i do this anyways.
---
On Pservers you can /camp and log back in at the front of the instance.

---
If you had TF, no you weren't strong, you just had TF.
---
The more I see Druid as the least chosen class the more I want to play it!
---
Well in TBC the other specs got “fixed” a lot so they were more viable.  
---
I would love to go elemental in classic at times but it’s just not viable. An OK mage will beat me every time.  
---
You might get taken, and honestly with 40 people your biggest contribution could be showing up consistently and not making dumb mistakes if you are in a casual guild, but you will always be bottom of the battle dps and have big mana problems.  
---
That being said, it’s a game so play what you have fun playing and don’t let others dictate how you spend your time.
---

---
I like the story about the 40 chinese famers who went raiding, first to practice the raids and then to sell raid drops to paying customers...   Sadly they didn't find enough customers and their boss made them farm furbolgs again 12 hours a day ....  Poor guys
---
There are less horde druids if it helps your decision
---
I judge the Boss and you Wand to regain mana.
---
Robe of the exalted is BiS for making money on top of the mailbox in goldshire.
---
I don’t know. You should disregard hunter so quickly.
---
At my age, unfortunately, I don't mind at all paying a chinese 1$ an hour to farm gold for me.
---
Those are fair points. I hadn't thought of them.
---
What does NS stand for?
---
No I did :)
---
it's good if you are playing with the boys and you don't want to get ahead of them xp wise
---
You won't use Warstomp that much, because you need to switch out of animal form. If you are tanking / fighting multiple mobs, this can hurt a lot.
---
Both staring zones are kind of tranquil, so do you prefer  green grass on a shiny day or purple grass on a mystical night?
---
The extra dodge for nightelves can be useful though.
---
&gt;100000000+ hours
---
You have 4.2 million days played? That's pretty impressive ;3;3
---
Who do you think it will be?
---
Of course some people will join from just watching on twitch, but and many of those will still stay around because the grind isn't as bad when you have as much time as young nerd have. League of Legends is effectively an infinite grind, that is the whole game. From what I've seen from jaded League of legends players they would probably really like wow classic.
---
Any lower and they’ll be in the red.
---
Hard to explain, the better option would be to watch a video. I’ll attempt though. 
---
Individual raid mechanics are fairly basic, run out with this debuff, spread for that cast, soak this swirl, dodge that beam, taunt swap at X stacks. Some get slightly more complicated but you get the idea. Where it gets difficult/interesting is most of these are on a timer where they happen every however many seconds. If they aren’t on a timer, they are based on boss health %. The timers can cause some nasty overlaps that require precise planning and execution to deal with. 
---
It’s can be extremely frustrating when 1-2 people regularly mess up the overlap, but when you all finally get it and consistently make it past that part of the fight, the progress felt is rewarding. Even more so when you make it over that last hump and secure the kill.
---
I think you ended the run in the bar, yes, but it's been a while. The most important part is to check for the rare mob as he's slightly out of the way if going straight to the bar.
---
YES. This is something new players need to know, classic is a journey, endgame is just a cherry on top! Playing the game for the last level defeats the point completely. It was the expansions that turned the game into that, but the OG game was never about getting to the last level and min maxing.
---
Surprised so many people want to play priest, fun at max level but it's not the easiest class to level
---
Joke's on them, they're gonna squish retail *into Classic*!
---
The difference in PvE is negligible, in PvP Tauren are way, way better imo. Stomp -&gt; Roots, Stomp -&gt; Hibernate pet, Stomp -&gt; Regrowth are all super strong. I'd even argue you can forego Nature's Grasp and play 0/30/21 instead of 1/29/21 if you're Tauren. 
---
Oh, and then there's that thing where Horde is just infinitely more cool.
---
Maybe this article could help with this?

---
I’m doing the same
---
You die a lot slower in retail and you have ample time to pop defensives and stall to keep yourself alive, which is why dampening has to be implemented in arena otherwise games just wouldn’t end. in classic fights ended in a flash with someone potentially dying within a cheap shot or a fear.
---
I rarely raided. There was so much content. All those quests and zones and then, the other sides zones that you technically didnt need to go into, but you wanted to complete your map..... and the dungeons that you want to see the story and lore of, that you could rarely finish in one go. Scholo  and Strat, live and undead, hours for each one and your armour would fail before you finished because you died so much, but it was sooo fun. Yeah, sorry my Vanilla bias is showing.
---
Nelf female and dwarf male have the best shooting animations.
---
My thoughts exactly. I get why people are attracted to the Paladin class fantasy - Arthas, Uther, Knights of the Silver Hand, Crusaders etc. - I'm a huge fan of it myself, but Ret plays like dogshit in Vanilla. It's not even the lack of an instant special melee attack which is the only problem (though it's a significant one), it's the lack of snares, gapclosers, reliance on RNG procs, a demand for many different stats on gear (which makes the spec massively gear dependant), and the use of a finite resource in mana. 
---
People talk a lot about the utility of Ret in PvP but Hamstring (snare), Intercept (stun) and Mortal Strike (healing debuff) are far more useful tools in organised PvP, and Ret doesn't have the +healing to make their heals a difference maker. I'd never tell people what they can or cannot play, and though I love Paladins, I really do think many Ret players would feel more fulfilled as a Warrior in Classic. I've played both for what it's worth, and Warrior is a lot more fun - with or without a healbot.
---
Sounds like surprise but sex.
---
&gt; pretty sure spirit didn't work in combat in vanilla.
---
It could be talented into. Most healer (and even most DPS) specs had Meditation.
---
As if im not listening to disturbed and avenged sevenfold now lol. I actually saw disturbed live, was during wrath im pretty sure.
---
I was 14 at the time of vanilla launch, my friend got me into it about a month after. I leveled a Nelf Fury warrior up to 52 before my mom cancelled my subscription so I could focus more on school and sports. Never got to that illustrious 60 ding. I will not be letting that happen again.
---
&gt; You are also completely clueless about the Spelladin build that will not be carried by anyone.
---
Spelladin sucks shit through a tube compared to a somewhat decent real dps class. Can you exist in a raid environment without instantly wiping the raid upon invite? Yes. Can you justify your raid spot compared to a viable, real dps class? Not really.
---
I could have literally never played the game and still been able to tell you that people don't like carrying people like you who can't pull their weight, spelladin or not. Also, I was referring to all memespecs, but I specifically mentioned ret. Shockadin might have a trick or two for a boss or two, but you'll never even be in the running for top dmg meters against competent players.
---
Why all the fuss buddy? Your desired spec is bad. It's not good. It's inefficient. If you find people who are willing to carry you through the game in spite of your garbage choice of spec, I applaud you. It must be a bit tricky. I'll try to avoid people like you, just like I'll avoid people who don't bring consumables or world buffs (as need be) or who expect the guild to pay for their epic mount, or whatever the fuck. I don't feel like going on a treasure hunt with someone wearing heels or whatever, because I'll have to do more work for the same treasure than if we'd brought a viable spec.
---
I will say, spriests are insane in pvp with no real counters. That being said though, those rogues, the dwarf especially, were awful. That blind into the barman shanker bleed was very very VERY bad. The human actually did the best, they were just too slow on the sap or a kick on your heal. The unfortunate part is during the AV test, they did not give us any pvp trinkets. (rogues being able to get out of fear, polymorph and charm effects) and being unable to use any engineering (shadow reflectors, bombs, rocket helm, etc) to actually stop any of the spriest abilities. A majority of these players are horrible, Kala is not though. Personally, I dueled r14 spriests all the time on nost in very similar gear to this test (barman shanker is one of the best daggers in the early pre raid game) and without any engineering, the fight is VERY onesided. Spriest will win like 90% of those fights, the only real counter to a spriest is engineering.
---
Lrt me reiterate, Kala is an insanely good player, the people he fought were for the most part not. That Beth rogue (the human) would've actually won if they either trinketed (which they can't) sapped the heal/kicked the heal, and didn't come out of stealth 6 seconds into a sap to bandage.
---
IMO Destro is much harder to play properly than Affli or SL. So if you managed the former, you will be able to manage the latter. Destro for raiding is relatively shit if you're intending to spec Conflag, because you can't use it in raid environments and are sacrificing either Shadow Mastery or Demonic Sacrifice. You can do it, but you're going to be behind properly specced locks.
---
That's all things you learn in time. I guarantee you that's what he will experience if it's the first time he plays wow.
---
took me 2 weeks to get to level 15 and I couldn't be happier, rushing this game defeats the points imo
---
As a new player I vehemtly agree that fun should be a priority, but I also think that the pressure is somewhat valid. Sure, leveling takes a huge amount of time, so you should enjoy it, but the counter argument is equally valid - You HAVE spent so much time leveling, so If you feel sub-par or left behind based only on your class, race or item choices, it would equally feel disappointing. I'm personally split. I want to play a hunter because they look fun, but equally I don't want to be useless and unneeded in raids past tranq shot, because I would have spent all the time leveling (and, of course, having fun), but someone is just 'better' off than me because they min-maxed. I don't think either side is wrong.
---
I listened to Darude's Before the Storm Album. Yeah, I know, meme. I'm serious though because this was before it was a meme. A guildy got Staff of Jordan from yeti's in feralas, so my cousin and I tried. So many yetis, but not staff. Fun experience though since it was my first time farming for something so rare.
---
Only one folks
---
It'll be far less common and probably won't happen til way later but I'm sure people will open a few spots for paying players. I say good luck for the paying players that do it for a specific item as vanilla bosses don't drop that many items.

If you're planning to pvp aswell honestly fury has some talents that will help you a lot more than prot, 5% crit piercing howl and booming voice are all very good, you really don't need the prot talents until maybe late 50s and even then you could just respec.

You mean utility like... a taunt ability?
---
Ya hes right. Its on the official website
---
Did every single suburban kid in the US grow up listening to rock? 
---
I don't think I've seen one single European listening to that stuff ever, which is why I find it so fascinating that every US player seems to think rock music and gaming go hand in hand.
---
What a beautiful duwang
---
As to why, it’s a big challenge that is quite complex - over 100 hours of /played time and a thousand ways to tackle routes and tricks to get to 60 quickly. Honestly it’s a crazy fun buzz if you enjoy the challenge, and most of the time you are chasing beating your own personal best. 
---
Amongst speedrunners the only firsts to 60’s that count in that community are unaided runs. Boosting, sharing etc are legit but classed as aided runs. 
---
1. Average casual 1-10 time you could expect to reach level 10 in 4 or 5 hours. 
---
2. The biggest time waster to 30 is travel time. Say for example you go to town to train every 2 levels, you could gain half an hour or more by skipping a few levels with talents you don’t really need. It might be better to grind a level in one spot rather than travelling to another zone, doing some quests, and travelling back. Smart hearths can save half an hour. 
---
3. Duskwood is a tough zone to make efficient because half the quests are on the opposite side of the zone to the town and FP. I do use it myself but the trick is to use the Westfall FP and run across to the graveyard - it’s much faster than running down the road. 
---
4. A sharp game to 20 will get you ahead of the horde at launch. They generally stick to the barrens until then and then drift into Ashenvale (mostly). Best tip is avoid starting fights, that’s the main one that causes trouble. I’ve done a heap of pvp launches and only come unstuck when I get too cocky. Everyone is in the same boat so it won’t set you back much to die occasionally:)
---
I'm not referring to Shockadin, you don't know what I'm even talking about and you have no relevant raiding experience. Less talking and more listening from you bud.
---
We got some Americans in our guild on ND who wants to continue playing with us on Classic even though we're an EU guild.
---
Gone back and forth for the last month and a bit. I’ll decide for a moment on a class and be locked in for about 5-6 days until doubt comes in and I start thinking about another class. 
---
Mained undead lock in Vanilla and enjoyed it but struggling with the decision of playing the same class again or switching up. Mages sounds exciting for multiple reasons, rogue for some wPVP and fun game style. Never played a shaman or priest in Vanilla but have considered both of them also. 
---
Healed a bit during WoTLK and legion. While playing DPS on lock/hunter. 
---
Honestly at this point wouldn’t not be surprised if I spin a randomized wheel the day classic launches and just go from there. 
---
Hopefully stress test will help a bit tomorrow! 
---
Cheers all.
---
Turns out work does have power here though...
---
More info: My friend does not have a beta invite. The option remains even after restarting the battle.net client.
---
Never touching retail again in my entire life, the game Blizzard are going for doesn't appeal to me in any way shape or form.
---
Journey and Leshraque are my tips
---
Where the **** in my In Flames!?
---
Call in sick
---
Hey no problem man! For each their own right? This post is simply not meant for you then! I know this is what I enjoy in WoW and some people don't, all good ;)
---
Haha I bet she has at least one hobby, right?
---
I've been Horde for 15 years., but let's be honest, Night Elf Female is pretty hot.
---
&gt;The dmg is about the same.  It just seemed lower on the beta because the streamers have bis due to fans and lvl cap.
---
Do you mean the damage is the same as private servers?
---
You been living under a rock or something since the Beta opened? Nearly everything is weaker on the Beta.
---
same here, I have stress test access but thats it
---
How is vanilla WoW not about raiding? What else could you do at level cap? I'm not interested in PvP. Sure, I can tank dungeons, but I'll get the gear sooner or later.
---

I lost a LOT of my videos when my DVD burner stopped reading the discs. :(
---
what the lol is this supposed to mean?  
---
nothing in your comments makes sense
---
Yes please do that! I would like to see :)
---
aye :)
---
Lots of masturbation in this post and in this community. I’m REALLY hoping Classic is better than this
---
If you mean they are still releasing albums, yes, they are still going
---
They just don't sound at all like old in flames, and I wouldn't have a problem with a change of sound if the music quality didn't drop so much
---
it me
---
So I am fairly sure that I will never reach lvl 60 because I simply dont play often. I would like to raid a bit when I get lvl 60 but realistically I dont think that I can put that much time into that.   
---
Even though I know that, I constantly think about which class I would play for raiding purposes. I was always a healer and having a priest is the most interesting class for me. However, since I do not think that I will reach 60, I will mostly just be leveling.   
---
Then the question raises - why not pick a rogue which you also enjoy ? Just focus on leveling,battlegrounds and world pvp since I mostly wont reach lvl 60 anyway. I hate dpsing in raids though...  
---
Difficult decisions !
---
Nature’s swiftness? I guess makes sense.
---
So I am still undecided between picking a Warrior or a Rogue
---
It will definitly be undead
---
I really like to tank, I can have a group almost instantly to tank 5-mans, I think I might also be able to raid fairly frequently giving me a chance to become MT or 2nd MT/OT for that chance of a thunderfury sooner or later
---
But repair costs and the slow way to farm is really annoying
---
On the other hand when I started with TBC I played rogue. I really like the playstyle and being able to kill things fast and efficient, farm stuff (PickPocketing, Invis when Threat approaches in form of elite or alliance pvp, ganking other players.)
---
Another part is I really want to play a lot of battlegrounds and respeccing with the warrior capping at 50g is really tough
---
I dont think I have that downside with rogues.
---
Sooner or later I will definitly have both at 60, but deciding what to main is still a problem for me
---
Yeah, my money is on Journey too.
---
&gt;No you dont need to, but it'll make you a better tank. Same as healers dont need to spec into healing, they can have hybrid specs as long as they stack healing gear.
---
Dont listen to this. There's too many trash can players who  lack the brain capacity to simply look at the talents and judge how they will affect threat.
---
Except for Defiance, there's barely any talents in prot that actually improves your ability to tank. You get a lot of utility, mitigation talents etc, but the only thing important pre raiding is your threat output. You get this from the other trees.
---
Hi, /u/Vomitbelch
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2fjdt/is_the_old_troll_funny_that_parodies_the_sublime/). 
---
Anyone else listen to dragon force while questing or was that just me. Set the mood so nicely.
---
I would have no problems with taking a conflag lock to MC and maybe BWL. We usually allow serious PvPers to keep their PvP spec in raids. MC and BWL is so easy that you don't need people with raid specs.
---
I've been a death knight main ever since they came out. Since I can't play that in classic, what class is the closest to that lore wise? Lore wise do death knights prefer a faction over the other? I wanna play the faction and race+class that is the closest lorewise to death knights if that makes sense at all. (im kinda taking the role playing part of wow too seriously maybe but that's just me, i apologize haha). So what do you guys think?
---
Some still pull it off. The Bard in FFXIV is a support class that people love having around. Does less damage but can restore manna and buff attacks/crit chances. And their songs are oh so pretty.
---
Druid: Is 0/30/21 or 1/29/21 viable for healing **and** tanking dungeons at 60? Perhaps even raids? With different gear sets ofc.
---
But Mages are OP and FOTM, so a lot of people don't want to play them. It's not fun to play the OP class imo.
---
Wheres rise against
---
who
---
I think it’s more warlock players being scared
---
I'm glad y'all are playing Classic and congrats on beating the system but at the same time.... /facepalm gov employees
---
ya, that's what I wrote.
---
Still can not decide If i want a dwarf or human Paladin 
---
I want to Casual Tank Dungeons holy prot hybrid 
---
Later full heal If i find a RAID guild 
---
:)
---
I don't have kids and still study and have a break until october. Wow classic here I come !
---
I'm a new player and I want to agree, I really do. But I've heard so much shit to the contrary that I'm finding it really hard to do so. I want to play a hunter on release, because they look like a bunch of fun, but every post and every wiki out their says they pretty much suck at pve and pvp compared to every other dps. Sure, I shouldn't min-max and I shouldnt stress about being nowhere near the top of the DPS in raids or whatever. But that's an unrealistic expectation, seriously. You can say 'just play for fun' countless times, but an equally true fact is that feeling useless or less powerful really sucks. If people out perform you and you are left behind based purely on choices like race and class, that does feel shitty. I don't want to play a night elf hunter and then feel rejected at later levels because my race/class combo is in the lower percentages. Because there WILL be min-maxed hunters who will be chosen over me. You spend so much time levelling, so should it enjoy it, but likewise you spend SO much time leveling that it should lead to you being satisfyingly powerful. If you spend all that much time and you are IRREVERSIBLY worse off than other players based on those choices, that does suck. Leveling is fun, sure, but so is feeling useful and powerful. It's a little reductionist to separate the two.
---
Can't decide on mage or rogue. I'll be playing semi-casual, with maybe 1 or 2 raids a week.
---
Mage is easier leveling, food/water, portal, chill pve rotation. Maybe less competition for gear. Much easier farm. 
---
Rogue has the world pvp potential, uses tier sets to a certain degree and can do stealth runs.
---
Can anybody who had played both to lvl 60 give their opinion on which class is the most fun?
---
Boo asmongold
---
Not vanilla, but I played WoW on a laptop for a very long time.
---
In Firelands, in the Majordomo Staghelm encounter - When the raid had to stack up (his cat form iirc) I would go into my settings and drop everything to minimum as fast as possible and just raid heal as best I could with like 4 fps, but then on the "spread" phase right after you had to watch out for some projectiles or something, so I had to go back into my settings and turn up a couple of the options.
---
This was in a guild competing for server first...our server was so shit lmao
---
I'm french and I thought about going on a NA server. But time zone is a big issue. And I played the game in french my whole life, i don't know the name of all the spells etc in english. So it's gonna be difficult .
---
I will play a tank and my friend a healer we were on planning on selling boost in dungeons
---
Your first statement agrees with what he technically already said, which is that warriors will do higher damage with better gear. All he's saying is that people think worries are bad dps (in comparison to other classes) with bad gear and he does not.
---
21 is not that many... 
---
I hope there's gonna be at least SOME overcrowding. some of my favorite nost memories were directly or indirectly caused by the "Beijing during rushhour" level of overcrowding.
---
Same here, but when you log in all realms are offline
---
I’m kidding! It’s pretty cool. :)
---
GL farming consumes, using dark runes, MMP's even on trash packs quickly deletes the casual out of this entire playstyle. you'll be going hard for a casual progression.
---
any meme spec ISNT casual, it requires 200% more input to achieve 75% of the output compared more "viable" classes. unless you are fine with being dead weight, ofcourse.
---
People now know how strong locks are, and have started to realize that Rogues really aren't as strong as they were perceived back in the day - and here I'm not talking about perplexity-esque players with hundreds of consumables. 
---
How many locks do you think instantly sacrificed their VW as soon as a rogue jumped them back in 05?  
---
Not a lot. Today 9/10 will do that.  
---
Locks are stronger than most remember them on 1.12. Rogues are weaker than most remember them on 1.12.  
---
Better itemization, amazing scaling, good in both PVE and PVP. Also super easy to play in PVE.  
---
That said, I think a lot of people will be in for a surprise when they realize that playing a lock well in pvp is pretty hard.
---
That's only a problem if you rely on fear, which you never should. Raiding as a horde warlock is a pain in the arse because your threat is ridiculously high.
---
man knows - any 2000-2006 metal is adequate.
---
personally ill be playing Bullet for My Valentine
---
Because undead warlock is probably the most classic of vanilla class combos of all time. It’s literally featured in the original vanilla cinematic.
---
I love how all pally’s think they’re equal to a shaman in vanilla though, wait until they discover what ‘Purge’ can do combined with wind fury.
---
Glhf everyone!
---
This is why I am surprised Blizzard aren’t adding wow tokens to classic. It seems inevitable that they will add classic wow tokens.
---
Priest is trivial to level. Their only problem is lack of mobility, which only affects speed, not difficulty. Only Hunter is easier imo.
---
MEIN HERZ BRENT!
---
This is probably the best, and most realistic response I’ve read so far to any of the “memespec” viability posts. 
---
Well put. Just going in with realistic expectations and knowing your limits is good enough.
---
i could never get into soil... really tried too.
---
Skindred however...
---
Supply and Demand ... demand for hunters is really low, and these polls are mainly answered by people who care enough about the game to take polls about it.
---
Trivium dude! "IIIIN WAAAAAAAAVES!"
---
Their new album is exceptional
---
My Curse?
---
Hell mine is playing with me haha
---
That was due to a combination of it being the top tier raid, and fairly difficult, and it coming out within ~6 months of TBC.
---
There is, it's named oldschool wow pvp music. There also used to be videos with the same name on youtube by drhankeey but most of them got taken down for copyright reasons.
---
Why do you need more than 4 tanks anyways? There are 4 different marks, aren't there? And you tank em so far apart that you only ever get hit by one, so why not just rotate around with 4 tanks and let the stacks of Boss1 fall off while rotation through Boss2-4?
---
I wish a designer of that fight would tell how they expected the fight to be done.
---
Yes?
---
I'm sad I can't upvote this more than once.
---
Awesome band!
---
Personally - i play a lot of Amon Amarth these days for WoW - tankng as a warrior while a guy screams to raise the sheild wall of the vikings is pretty amazing xD
---
What about pick pocket resists? That's effected by level right?
---
I would say non ... But if you need an answer I would guess warlock or ShaddowPriest. 
---
But I think you could roll a human Paladin, and paly it as pre death Knight, before he has fallen to the lich king
---
Hip hop heads can‘t relate
---
I don't think you understand the MASSIVE differences between Classic and Retail. Not only you, but a lot of other people. 
---
Plenty of things that are in Retail won't work in Classic, mainly because of 2 major differences : the population size and the community aspect.
---
What WILL happen in Classic will be guilds selling MC and BWL raid spots, and a very small number of groups of 3 people (tank, healer and DPS) that will sell gear runs for orbs. That happened in Vanilla, and will happen in Classic. However, those raid spots will be very limited, because only top guilds will sell those raid spots. And because a Classic realm population is small, the number of top guilds will also be small. I would say 3-4 per faction.
---
In Retail, you have tens of thousands of people on connected realms, and the content is so easy, that every 3 guys can sell M+ runs, every 7 guys can sell 10 man flexible raid runs and so on. In Retail there are A LOT OF RUN SELLERS and there are A LOT OF RUN BUYERS.
---
In Classic, almost nobody will sell dungeon runs. Because there aren't enough buyers. There is no Titanforging. There is no personal loot. The loot is VERY LIMITED. Most people would rather spend 2 hours in Scholo with their friends, instead 40 minutes with boosters. There is no XP boost for grouping. There is no heirloom XP gear. 
---
Classic does not have the ways that exist in Retail for lvl boost and/or gear boost.
---
On a side note, no type of LFG addons, or gear score addons, will work in Classic. Such addons will exist, but nobody will use them. Why would you need an LFG addon in Classic, when you will run dungeons with guild mates and friends? The community aspect will trump an LFG addon. Most 5 men groups in Classic are guild mates and friends. And friends of a friend. The "LFM Tank " groups are the MINORITY here. They won't get a tank faster if there is an LFG tool. They won't travel faster to a dungeon if there is an LFG tool. And when you consider that you will have around 2-3k people only, when most will do their thing, and most of what is left is already in guild / friends only groups, there is a very small pool of people remaining for random 5 men runs. An LFG tool won't make any difference whatsoever.
---
Same for gear score, or [raider.io](https://raider.io), or whatever other stupid tool that somehow decides a player skill based on gear or some parses or whatever. It works on Retail, but it won't in Classic. Due to small population and strong community relationships, the VAST majority of people won't give a fuck if you are full T2 decked...but you aren't their friend or guild mate. In Retail, this works, because there is no community identity, and you don't know who is who, so the better the gear, the better chances for completing a run.
---
Don't worry about boosters in Classic. They won't exist, because the foundation for boosting doesn't exists. Selling MC and BWL runs for gear will be vastly smaller than Retail. You can't sell MC and BWL runs if you aren't in a guild that can do it with 25 people and 15 retards. And those guilds will be limited, 3-4 per faction, maximum. And most likely, they will already have the raid spots sold to friends, and they won't advertise, because they will be already full.
---
These things are done in Discord and between friends, not in /2.
---
There are just TOO MANY FUNDAMENTALS that don't exist in Classic, for boosters.
---
My main is a pally so same same :)
---
Those bastards! They had no right to take my Nicker away!
---
You can tank any dungeon in fury/arms.
---
To all of you would be DPS warriors:
---
If the tank dies and the mob or boss runs rampant through the raid, you are expected to equip a shield and taunt the boss back into safety. If you do this and prevent a wipe I can promise you that purple rain is incoming. 
---
And this will 100% happen. Raids are seldomly completely smooth. You need to be able to tank. This also means that if there are no offtanks showing up for raids, one of you furies will have to go on tank duty. Learn how to tank boys.
---
You can almost smell the virginity oozing from this picture alone
---
!remindme 5 months
---
I can't wait to see how wrong I was and have an amazing game or tell y'all who think it's not a big deal I told you so. Win win confirmed.
---
In vanilla wow was about raiding, at least for me.
---
I was level 54 for like a full year because all I wanted to do was explore every part of Azeroth and mine ore.
---
I was initially going to roll rogue or warlock, but recently decided to just go hard on druid, simple because I can fill any spot while leveling, and can still be decent in all roles as hybrid if I tryhard appropriately.
---
City of Evil by Avenged Sevenfold???
---
Amon Amarth plz &lt;3
---
They are in the wayback machine I’m pretty sure.
---
You’ll be missing a bunch of the tricks that make healing go well, but 0/30/21 is good enough for dungeons at 60. Maybe raiding as a raid healer, but you won’t be able to keep up with full spec healers and you’ll need to be very careful about mana.
---
It's for the stress test...
---
Does anyone read the official forums? 
---
This would be quickly answered. Also, stress test details are listed on this sub.
---
The stress test that starts today is open to *anyone* with an active sub.
---
Absolutely.
---
https://youtu.be/bG5P71m6D4g
---
As someone who spent most of high school and college playing WoW, the thing I'm looking forward to the most is making new friends the best way I know how - playing WoW.
---
And no one is looking forward to warrior leveling.
---
All of my vanilla characters on my banned account look like this.
---
Both. Mythic raider on retail, two night raider on classic.
---
It will be over 9,000. That is for sure.
---
7,711,927,821 is over 9,000, so it is possible.
---
Id love to ses a warrior pidgeon charging in and being downed 1 second later.
---
Maybe it's because I'm mostly pvp, but it seems like 90% of horde on my pserver are undead or orc. I hope it's not like that in Classic.
---
It's an addon... that times your swings
---
I got in today too, pretty sure it’s for the stress test. It lets me start the game but all the servers are listed as down. Not sure what time the stress test starts
---
"Guess i'm gonna do this myself!"
---
Thanks again!
---
This guy gets it!
---
IMO one of the major factors of blizzard releasing Classic is because they want to pull players into Retail. Your sub will cover both and retail has all the monetization options. Also if you watched Ion’s video yesterday talking about their plans moving forward with Retail its clear they’re at least acknowledging many (not all) of the issues people have with the game and are looking to make changes. If Classic does really well, and I’m sure we all hope it does, I wouldn’t be surprised if they not only release a TBC server but take some lessons learned and apply them to Retail and get it back on track. 
---
Classic is also going to be an effective tool for their release schedules. Blizzard is known for releasing Xpacs and patches around competitor studio releases. Classic’s phased release content with give them another tool in their kit to use during their Retail content droughts and other games releases.
---
"FREEDOM!"
---
There’s so much material for it, too. Just a quick scroll of reddit would provide hundreds of ideas
---
Here’s an idea. Go back and look at the launcher. The answer is obvious.
---
Godsmack - Voodoo, for the best Troll Shaman experience
---
Breaking Benjamin were in every single WoW PvP video from vanilla until Cataclysm.
---
Or Scatman John if you want to gank some low lvls for hours, killing all their quest NPCs and making them log out out of anger only to catch them again when they log back in.
---
The moral of your men will be tenfold if you make it back alive.
---
I’ll be listening to Ghost and Rammstein.
---
It's to pre download the client for the stress test that starts tonight, everyone in the Americas and Oceanic regions automatically got invited. And before people ask, no you can't keep playing after the 2 day stress test. And no, don't expect to get in for the first few hours the queues and technical problems take a while.
---
I totally agree, but on what you said for newcomers to enjoy the game their way, there is unfortunately a lot of gatekeeping from playing what spec you want like retri paladin or balance druid and that is the worst too me.
---
I get it that having a retri pala in a raid is not the greatest but for a regular dungeon it should and does not matter.
---
Message me.
---
"bet they'll have to bandage, ha"
---
Jobs such as those are often just public insurance policies. Well, that's the best way to think about them. Too costly for capital to create or have contracted in the automated safety, and some reactions are too complex to computerize. So they may be paid to sit and watch, but the one time a year they are needed, they're worth the $40k or $80k to avert $1mil in damages and loss of public faith.
---
In that case ret becomes viable as well
---
Perhaps, but this does look promising for those who want to raid as Horde hunters, since the American numbers for hunters are even lower than druids!
---
There’s literally a separate launcher that says beta. L2Read.
---
Do you have a written guide or something in image/video format you could share for this 1-30 speedlvling?
---
Below you mention you follow Johanna's for a 75% aprox, what steps out of the box do you do?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Down with the Sickness yeah. They dont do PVP vidoes like they used to...
---
I'm still gonna go Tank Druid.
---
Wow this looks suspiciously well balanced.
---
Also understandable that less Alliance players want to play Warlock than Horde ones (becaue of WotF) but I have problems understanding why Priest is "so low" on Horde.
---
launcher/login screen, yea
---
Blink Frost nova - Cone of cold - Sapper charge - Ice block - Cold snap - Frost nova - Coc - sapper - arcane explosion til you die or be a pussy and ice block blink out.
---
Well people sell mythic raid runs and for those you have to be on the same realmpool
---
Nutsack
---
Question will be how they will divide over the servers. It sounds awesome well balanced but in reality you'll possibly end up with servers that have 80% Horde/20% Alliance or vice versa.
---
I got the same thing Friday when they updated to AV
---
I was in the stress tests before, so that’s might be why I could see it then, and the people who haven’t been in stress test before can see it now. Atleast that would be my guess
---
People who played in 2005 have been playing for years and years, enjoying themselves on pservers, your fears are unfounded. 
---
Maybe you are different, but the game has absolute a great replayability for most people.
---
Can probably play one-handed tbh.
---
If only they would re-release OG Four Loko, too!
---
Thanks for the detailed reply. I had no idea about that anger management effect. Googled it and it is a thing though so thanks for the info, that makes a huge difference to the talent really. Crazy they don't mention it. Is it definitely in classic though? Wasn't like a quirk they added later?
---
Little Vurtne ofc. His plays were out of meta.
---
The only thing you need to tank while leveling is a shield and a quick one-hander. Don't need to spec protection for it.
---
good attitude :)
---
I think 5pm est
---
youtube
---
Great investment if you get your sold goods back 10 years later in pristine condition.
---
Do you have a link for your guide please.
---
Ah, well til then haha
---
But who's gonna do all the chores and look after the kids?
---
Because the majority of people that play are males and there are many people in one spot. Pretty accurate statement.
---

---
The mods here get a bit touchy about links, so I’d rather stick to discussion
---
Well obviously... paired with the fact this was pre BC content. This would enable people to have a free 40 mount on day 1 and then when you hit 60 a free epic mount.
---
Imagine the powerspike from removing that much gold from your table of shit to farm to be raid ready. You would be insanely far ahead anyone who didnt have a TCG mount card.
---
No kids, and plenty of time for chores when I go back to work
---
I would probably use + spell damage, if at 60. Shaman weapon enhancements are not the same as enchants.
---
only dumb women complain about video games
---
a smart woman would much rather have you on the computer locked and quiet where she knows where you are rather than out and about with the boys getting blind drink and surrounded by thots and tourists finger banging strangers
---
From the internet where else do you buy wives from?
---
So have I, I played a lot of beast cleave and tsg as well as rmp and rls. And rating inflation was also insane during most of wotlk due to how many people were playing at that time. Thats also when the first 3k teams happened. You could find almost every spec in the 2k range back then. There are always going to be certain comps that work better than others during certain seasons for various reasons. But to get really high rated with an hpal required good timing with sacs and cd management. Just because you can get 2k doesn't automatically make it good or op, especially when ratings are going up to 2800-3k in a given season. Yes ret was indeed broken for a good portion of wotlk, there's even a video of a guy that bound CS, DS, and Judge to all his keys and beat someone in a duel by literally rolling his face on his keyboard. Besides you're also talking about when rmp and mage wizards were popular and they could shut down paladins with ease because of spellstealling wings and freedom. Honestly wotlk was fairly balanced as far as arenas go, compared to cata and mop where you literally had unkillable rogues(cata) and people getting oneshot by shamans and warlocks(mop).
---
The whole purpose of this thread was whether or not Athene was the best paladin in the world, that is doubtful because there are a lot of multi r1 paladins who were way more skilled. But you also can call him trash because he was also a multi r1 hpala. Trash players cant get r1 even when their class is op, because the mongo strats that work at low ratings for those classes get shut down by people at higher ratings who have better mastery of their class. Sure they might be able to get a little higher than they usually would (1800-2.2k) but going much farther than that is hard for those types of people.
---
Is the stress test still up to level 5?
---
Almost correct, but the damage if I dont do my job is worth significally higher than $1mil.  
---
And I dont work for the gov.
---
&gt; it seems like 90% of horde on my pserver are undead or orc. I hope it's not like that in Classic.
---
More like 95% actually. WOTF will create 75% of your Horde player base, if not more on a PVP realm. It's the way it was back then.
---
Armin Van Buuren
---
Only when there are ogre quest givers.
---
Another big part was something mentioned in the video - the story + world was a continuation of the Warcraft games, so there was a lot of interest and built-in anticipation from past players of that series. Another thing that was mentioned elsewhere was that the LotR movies had just come out, so there was a lot of interest and awareness for other Tolkien-esque stories or games, etc.   
---
It wasn't any one thing that brought success, and some things arguably contributed more than others. They just managed to come along in the right time with a great game that has (obviously) had lasting interest &amp; enthusiasm.
---
Armin’s old hits
---
Said every non-tank player ever.
---
You can raid as most of those, though only up to AQ40.
---
We should curate the official vanilla wow spotify playlist guys!
---
I think for tanking dungeons, just keep a shield and 1H on you. You don't necessarily need to use the shield all the time, but if you're new to talking it's a good idea. 
---
And -- this is important -- as you're leveling, make sure to skill up your 1H weapon skill(s) by using 1H weapon (or weapons -- I expect you'd skill up faster if you're dual wielding) sometimes while grinding or questing. If you 2H all the time and then go into a dungeon and swap on your 1H that is 30 skill points too low because you haven't used it in 6 levels, that's going to be a bad time.
---
31/20/0 is the usual pvp spec. Sometimes people used to do 31/5/15 for a hybrid pvp/tank spec. But the prot tree is really not necessary unless you're taking 40 man stuff. 
---
You can try things out at 60 and see what you like? (I always thought respeccing and experimenting was a good use of gold.) There are some interesting things you can do as prot, like, when you have decent tanking gear at 60 you can solo large packs of melee guys (since you completely block most of the attacks and don't take any damage). But for the most part, I didn't enjoy being prot.
---
An ideal post to say, I’ve always had Vurtne to thank for his PVP videos that introduced me to some of my now favourite bands. Soilwork, Escape the Fate, Atreyu... and more. 
---
(Also drakedog bringing Sonic Syndicate into my life.) Many of these bands I’ve now seen live! 
---
Kala’s recent Priest beta PvP video also used some music that immediately caught my attention. I’m looking forward to finding some great new bands solely through PvP videos alone over the next few years!
---
I was really into industrial music at the time, so Orgy, Static-X, Dope (die motherfucker is a song I saw on A LOT of pvp vids), Coal Chamber and etc for me.
---
Sometime in 06 I got really into techno tho and got those hour long mixes on Limewire and would listen to a few of those on loop while I farmed (for gold and honor).
---
OOH WAH AH AH AH
---
I will only play Classic, but I will surely at some time explore retail, after all I missed all  the content from lvl 81 to 110 or 120 or whatever they are at now.  But I don't think that I will invest serious time in retail
---
Current plan is shaman and aiming to PvE heal, what professions go best?
---
Mostly Felhunter
---
Why is that I wonder.
---
Philly represent! Im from beautiful DELCO.
---
"Hacked" 🤫🤫🤫
---
Yes they can.
---
I think you should read a in depth guide about the 40 man version of the fight to get a better understanding.
---
The gist of it is that you need to drop the stack from a boss, before you can tank it again. 
---
If a tank has 7 stacks, but moves in proximity of the boss before the debuff has run out, you will get 8 stacks with a refreshed timer.
---
Even if your raid members rotates perfectly, they might need to hang out in the safe zone a bit. This is to ensure the duration of the stacks has expiered, before they can engange the same boss again.
---
What? It's the absolute best at lvling together with mage :D
---
Wand dmg, spirit tap. And later on, shadowform. Amazing heals at early levels too with renew and shield
---
9.37 Gb.
---
I don't have BfA, and my retail sub is off since January 2018, so it should be related to Classic.
---
Something like 1% of players in TBC even attempted Sunwell.
---
These are the kinds of players who will get an add-on to guide them to 60, get some decent gear so they can get into MC and then complain that Classic WoW is too boring.
---
Yes, with the ID you can get it back
---
Haha fair one my dude.
---
Yes still works, not it every mob tho.
---
succ is good for the sleep CC, felhunter is good for destroying mages, voidwalker is good vs rogues/warriors (for the sacrifice shield spell)
---
&gt; Can't wait to play a druid and bear tank.
---
You'll be waiting a long time, just ask Rasi, all you'll end up with are healing pants.
---
In Flames. I think they were starting to get popular towards the end of vanilla
---
This is extremely true.
---
So funny to read about Rammstein, as a german, from you us people. Must be the same for you maybe when we Talk about english Bands. But yeah this are great tracks for pvp Videos.
---
Yes I am restrictive not to be overly vocal about it incase it falls short but as far as I've heard most of The stuff needed for it to Work has been confirmed om The beta as working
---
Greetings from a fellow Oomkin,
---
[Here](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/druid-talents/?tal=50005030025513510000000000000000505023100000000)'s what I would suggest for PvE and here are the key differences compared to your talent tree:
---
* **Improved Wrath** vs. *Nature's Grasp* - You will never need Nature's Grasp for PvE but you might have encounters that have higher Arcane resistance which means Wrath will need to be a solid alternative.
---
* **Improved Healing Touch** vs. *Nature's Focus* - Just like Nature's Grasp, Nature's Focus is not a PvE talent - the thought that an Oomkin will need to heal while the threat is on them is despair and a sure wipe anyway. Improved Healing Touch helps you cast faster and be more efficient as that temporary healer.
---
* **Insect Swarm** and **Improved Enrage** over *Improved Thorns* - Improved Thorns does not give you extra DPS - it will give the tank the DPS. But that doesn't make you any more reliable. On top of that, you want to be in TOP DPS charts - Insect Swarm not only decreases the target's chance to hit by 2% but gives you that extra DPS that you need in your rotation. Finally, Improved Enrage can be used as a last resort to Bash-and-run the target because you took threat but your tanks respond fast enough and you want to prevent a Combat Ress being used on you.
---
Just my 2 cents - and throw whatever you can at Spirit rather than Intellect.
---
For anyone who says some classes are "overpopulated", don't listen to them.
---
If you want to raid, you will get a raid spot.
---
Succ is helpful vs all classes. Felh is only good vs casters and rogues, but it's probably better vs casters than succ. (Double) void is very good if you're SL. Even imp has its use - with that BWL trinket, it's a machine gun.
---
No unique answer here.
---
I like it.
---
Haha what?
---
where is the edgy screamo / mellodic death metal :DDD Pendulum, In flames, Pain, Scary Symmetry, Disharmonia Mundi, Sonic Syndycate
---
Why bother, loot council is the best system. 
---
It is a self regulated system. Classic vanilla will be mostly based on server fame/reputation. If a guild give all the item to their officier core, members will just leave and made a bad advertisement on the server, so it will be harder to recruit and then it will be harder to raid.
---
On the other hand, if only one players leave because he think he deserved more the item than other one but only him think that, this person will get a lootwhore reputation and have a harder time entering in a guild.
---
It's perfect balance.
---
You just need to be cristal clear at start: Loot council is a guild before all and most invested/best players will get the best loots first.
---
Given the distribution on past private servers I'd be shocked to see rogue so low
---
Its a small portion of the post.  There are a lot of nuances to healing in vanilla.  That is why the game is good.   Forgive me
---
yes, provide the following info you can, the more the better:
---
-name of character you remember, race, level, class, server
---
-account name (pre battle.net integration)
---
-account email
---
-your name
---
-address of when the account was registered
---
-phone number
---
-cd key
---
-take a pic of your ID and send it to them
---
Somebody made a good point on a podcast I was listening to the other day --
---
The guys in the beta know what they're doing... they have the optimal spec and the optimal gear.
---
In 2004, even good players had no idea what they were doing.
---
If the people in the beta respec to random terrible specs, and equip a bunch of "of the whale" greens and stuff, then for sure they would find the game much more difficult.
---
I remember (from 2005) running SM with 4 people and getting loot that we couldn't equip yet because we were too low level. I think that once you have some idea what's going on, you don't find it hard any longer.
---
But it will still be tough enough to encourage people to group up (e.g. quests that go into densely populated caves or fight elite monsters or whatever). I think it'll be OK.
---
Where the hell is Breaking Benjamin, Staind, Trust Company, Papa Roach, Offspring, Metallica, Halloween, Ozzy, and ofc DragonForce??
---
Succubus is the higher skill floor, lower skill ceiling option.
---
Is there a plan to have a differnt icon/launcher for classic?
---
Don't underestimate a (well played) mage's world PVP abilities :)
---
How would that even work on a server infrastructure level??? Each server has it's own separate database.
---
And prot via reckoning.
---
They can restore your access but not items or gold removed from the account. Since you're likely not planning to play your characters from back then it's not really an issue. 
---
Source: had the same thing happen myself.
---
Some angry people on here..try to relax
---
I'm asking myself if raiding as a mage is even worth the trouble in the early phases if all I want is gear to be viable in pvp. It's not like I have a good chance to get Azuresong mageblade when I'll be competing with ~9 other players for it.
---
Greetings from Pittsburgh!
---
Stress test won't be on beta servers it appears...
---
Everyone with a sub in NA can participate so this us a "launch stress test"
---
They will see how many people try to log in at 2pm pdt and break down which type of server gets overloaded and hopefully test layering to the max in starter zones. 
---
Should be a fun time :)
---
Elites don’t hit anywhere near as hard in classic as they do on private servers, deadmines will be a breeze for him.
---
Vanilla is what you make it.
---
there already are vanilla wow playlists on spotify just type wow / wow oldschool / wow pvp and sort by playlists...
---
I'm going herb/alch because of the ability to farm while skipping fights using stoneclaw. Same could apply to mining/herb + enchanting
---
Thanks so much!
---
It's not that bad to level, not nearly as bad as Paladin or Warrior.  The downtime is minimal so you can continuously grind without having to spot to eat,drink.
---
Hunters are one of the strongest classes in the game for both pve and pvp for different reasons, I'm not sure why anyone would say otherwise. In pvp they're absolute monsters when played right, it's extremely hard to live against a hunter who opens up on you out in the open world. In BG's they drain mana from healers and casters extremely fast and are one of the better classes for finding stealthed players due to track hidden and flare. If you roll night elf you have an extra advantage with shadowmeld as well so you can actually defend things really well if nobody happens to see you. 
---
In pve their utility is insane if you know what you're doing: you can kite for days, you have no glancing blows (which means you do full damage almost all the time), you are absolutely required for raids due to tranq shot removing enrages, and you can CC a lot of things that mages can't sheep or rogues can't sap. In terms of prolonged DPS in raid encounters they are not going to be up there with the rogues, warriors and mages but you are by no means useless or powerless.
---
Vanilla is a vastly different game than modern WoW where you are judged based on a meter. You are judged as a player, you are judged based on whether or not you're doing the right thing in the situation moment to moment. Sometimes you will not be able to DPS your heart out because you'll be trying to save the healer with a scatter shot/frost trap combo or kiting a mob around while the rest of your team bursts down something else, or in PvP just simply keeping enemies busy while your team resurrects... That's the shit that will distinguish you above other hunters in Vanilla.
---
And min/maxing down to the race means nothing if the person behind the wheel doesn't know what the fuck they're doing. Especially when the difference is so minuscule. Don't let this subreddit or community fool you into thinking that you're trash if you don't play a certain way, because a lot of them talk like they've world first cleared Naxxramas day 1, but in reality they probably struggled to do anything beyond Strath Live. Also, most of this min/max your life away shit is being generated by the private server community which literally had nothing better to do for years on end; it's basically only done if you want to speed run through raids which most people will not do. 
---
There's literally no point in min/maxing that much if you are new to the game, your main goal should be to pick something you think you'll enjoy and learn the fuck out of it. Personally, I'd take any person of any race/class combo who knows their class really well over someone who min/maxed their shit but doesn't really know what the hell they're doing. The former will only get better as their gear progresses (which it will), the latter will most likely end up killing people and be a burden to their whole team which costs a LOT of time in Vanilla.
---
West europe is bilangual so english shouldnt he a problem, expect for france and germany.... and some former sovjet countries
---
I wish that they would just remove it. Wiping on a boss because the server couldn't process your action fast enough is a real stupid system to have in 2019.
---
Different games for different folks. As a 13 year old i had time for the grind, as a 32 year old with a family I dont. Itll be interesting just to see who actually has the time for vanilla. I mean ill slowly level a toon but i wont be able to dedicate the time to it that you need to.
---
Probably just mess around in arena on retail. Rest of the game is frustrating as fuck and can be substituted on classic.
---
I haven't heard one way or another. Dungeon kill grinding does seem like it will be a good way to level with a decent group. 
---
The reason it might not always be the best option is enemy levels. For example Deadmines has 17-20 level mobs. Stockades is 23-26. Since you don't want to really grind in an instance where all the enemies are +3 levels or more. This means you want to be around level 22-23 before you enter the stockades. [At level 21 the level 17 enemies in Deadmines will only give you 63% of their xp values](https://i.imgur.com/qqJy6Wy.jpg). 
---
The other options of Shadowfang Keep and Blackrock Depths take a lot of travel time. Which while more level appropriate than Deadmines take twenty to thirty minutes of running to get to the instance.
---
Similarly from [Stockades (23-26)](https://classicdb.ch/?zone=717#npcs:0-2+1) you go to [Gnomeregan (28-33)](https://classicdb.ch/?zone=721#npcs:0-2+1) where you have quiet a large level difference between the lowest level of stockades and a desirable level to enter the instance. Or alternatively [RFK (25-30)](https://classicdb.ch/?zone=491#npcs:0-2+1) which while a little easier to overlap, again requires a long walk to the Southern Barrens without a mount.
---
So. While it is definitely good experience at ideal levels. It may be undermined by significant downtime from travel time or fighting lower level enemies. It's something that you'd have to test to be sure. But sadly we're unlikely to get access to that information given the limited access to the beta.
---
There is an ashenvale quest chain called cleansing the totem eventually it will give you a totem item that turns you into a furbolg. Don't complete the quest from there. Just keep it so you keep the item. Never abandon the quest and you will always have the rod.
---
want to trade wives?
---
It's overrated IMO. It reduces downtime but things take slightly longer to kill because you waste 10 rage. It allows you to survive larger pulls. It's a good thing to do but by no means "essential".
---
Is this a joke?
---
Did it last year on a private server without much issue. 
---
STV was a bit cancerous but I don't think that's because I was a priest.
---
I’ve been considering this because the only time I could really raid consistently aligns with EU prime time.  Will still most likely play on NA servers and keep my eyes peeled for a early afternoon raiding guild on NA servers.  I know there won’t be many,  but I’m sure a couple will show up. Will just have to server transfer when I finally find one. 
---
Worst case scenario I’ll just do what I can through pugs and focus on PVP.  Or if I really get the itch I’ll buckle down and setup an EU account...
---
Everyone else has it.....
---
tl;dr - potato proof
---
I do that with retail now, but my wife doesnt go to sleep early. I get aggro if I play too much. I have dedicated nights that I schedule and hope her work schedule helps me out the rest of the week. She works nights so if I get lucky I get more game time. haha
---
Felthunter is also good for detecting Rogues too right?
---
Because alot of them, has been asked, and not once, but more about 50times, and those threads are being downvoted
---
What would you do if STV isn't a possibility at launch. Unless you are going PvE :)
---
Do you grind any levels between 20-30?
---
That meaty 3-finger slap
---
Overall best is the felhunter, even though all 3 (felhunter, succubus and voidwalker) have their very distinct advantages in different scenarios.
---
Yea, it's confusing, but a little common sense goes a long way
---
I'm calling it now that even with the amount of warriors being voted here, we'll still always be short tanks.
---
What do you think about tank's quantity? I would like to tank PVE / DPS Pvp as Warrior, but im afraid about spot in raid group. Every single chart show huge amount of warriors no idea what to do :(.
---
Why make the switch then in your case?  I’m on the other side being American but considering EU.  Only reason is that my available times to raid align with EU prime time (early afternoon on the US East coast).  It wouldn’t even be on my radar if I could reliably raid during NA prime times when 99% of guilds set their raiding schedule.
---
Orc shaman just screams enhancement for me. I'm pretty sure that spec was created for orcs alone
---
Add static x to this as well
---
Not required, but definitely expected given the timeframe.
---
Rolling a human warrior.
---
How would you get ahead of the pack in Elwyn, given that there's going to be a lot of congestion with all the people rolling human?
---
We considered grouping as 5 to push out of Nortshire quickly and avoid chokepoints like Fargodeep mine, and then splitting into solo/duo at level 7-9 depending on how it fits.
---
I just bought some off eBay for $5 after seeing this post.
---
&gt; But the ability to respec is not as relevant because within an encounter, you have to choose one (and only one) role.
---
Yes, but that does give you the ability to do different things even within the same raid.  A melee DPS that can hearth -&gt; respec to offtank/healer -&gt; summon back is going to be more appealing both to players when choosing a class but also to raid leaders choosing who to bring.
---
I think it's better to consider the points of "respec options" and "utility" at the same time because of the above:  All other things being equal, a class with more options is simply better than a class with less options.  So they have to take a hit in some category, and DPS makes sense.  But with that DPS hit you can also squeeze in some utility.
---
If you're just looking at DPS in one specific encounter you don't want people to say "Well the Rogue does more DPS, and we don't need an offtank/healer, so the Feral is definitely inferior".  So by adding in the utility, the Feral can bring something that results in higher DPS for his group (or the raid) than if you'd brought another Rogue... despite the fact that the Feral has the respec options above.
---
In the end it doesn't really matter what small differences there are in our opinion though, as Classic is going to be wildly imbalanced regardless and it will be far out of our hands when some new balance decision is made anyway, lol.
---
I dont think classic will be a bust, I just think they'll have an influx and than when content is completed that influx will drastically drop because of no new content. Retail and classic are totally different games and I think itll be hard to blizz to lure in folks from retail that have never played classic.
---
I would argue that the fact that you are non-competitive is irrelevant. You are still there to clear the content and why the hell should someone who shows up for one raid in ten get that piece of gear that I want when I have been here for every raid? This bs drove me crazy in vanilla too. Giving the gear to someone who shows up infrequently is madness imo!
---
What do fire lords and Keanu Reeves have in common? They’re both hot AF and they’re both talked about in this week’s Countdown To Classic podcast!

---
Cheers,
---
\- Josh.
---
haha righttttt.
---
Sad to think that if I renewed my subscription and entered IF, that it’d be nearly desolate of players. IF deserves more
---
Downranking renew is not as mana efficient as max renew.  Plus you eat into your 5 second rule by using it.  So unless someone can argue that then id say always use max as an auxiliary to another spell cast
---
Expected by whom? For what purpose?
---
It's utter shit. I would never play Warlock on Alliance side unless on a PvE server. Having a Rogue slap your ass around while being immune to your primary defense is just utter bullshit (or a Warri, like Berserker Rage isn't bad enough, they get a second fear immune). WotF was just one of the most terrible design decisions in classic. Hardiness as well. Horde Racials are just way too good for PvP. A freaking AoE stun on top of that.
---
Obviously this isn't as important in group pvp but for getting ganked while questing or farming, WotF is just a huge "FUCK YOU" to Alliance Warlocks.
---
The amount of times some Horde Mage told me Warlocks are easy to beat for mages aggravated me so hard. Of course it's easy when you're not running around in fear for 30 minutes while your health ticks down.
---
Luckily Alliance got Perception, which is super easily avoidable and only useful when you already know that there is an invisible (stealthed) enemy nearby - how great! Or an out of combat stationary stealth. Oh and increased corpserun speed so you can get back to your body quicker when that fear immune Horde Rogue ganked your ass again. (I know there are no Nelf Locks, I'm just venting)
---
Well at least Stone Form and Escape Artist are useful, although neither is available for Warlocks so there is that.
---
Slightly mad about this. I still love classic to bits but that doesn't mean it was pristinely perfect. Spec viability and Racial balance were kinda bad, sadly.
---
With all that in mind I do think that (assuming this poll is representative) the distribution is amazingly good, all things considered.
---
Loot council has killed more guilds than Naxx.
---
Compromised maybe, because your info made it in the hands of someone else just randomly. But if you have that info yes, contact them. Worst that could happen is they say no, you have to start over once it's released anyways.
---
Daily reminder, alliance primary capital in Classic is Ironforge, not Stormwind.
---
I can't remember could you switch gear during the fight?
---
Which is this?
---
&gt; paste eating
---
*glue eating
---
yeah they have stealth detection. guessing with rain of fire helps too lol
---
Finally i will be able to get Thunderfury on my Survival/Melee Hunter!
---
Perfect way to start my day!
---
Don't sleep on orc females.
---
Wipe away that dribble
---
Wearing male? I hope they are... femail. :D
---
I\`m in the exact same boat. I love leveling, i love Wpvp and can\`t settle on a damn class.
---
The problem with the system you're suggesting is the same as it is with any dkp, players will hoard their points for rare items meaning the less rare items will end up on people where it benefits the guild less.
---
You can switch weapons, but not armor.
---
Ahh damn I’m from Europe! Never mind, have fun :)
---
You ask here instead of asking customer service.
---
I played rogue and hunter in vanilla. I’m interested in going Lock this time around and I plan on doing a healthy amount of pve/pvp while juggling school and work. Is this feasible or should I look into the least “gear-dependent” class? I’m also considering just going Resto Druid despite never healing at endgame level.
---
It is in classic but I fear that blizzard forgets the gimmick and changes it. But hopefully they will add tool tips to the misleading talents.
---
Yes everyone with an active sub has access to the 48 hour stress test that starts today at 2pm pdt
---
wasn't that TBC?
---
But’Yu’Dunt
---
Nah. Warri &gt; Mage &gt; Priest are like the most wanted classes. And then Rogues because ganking and wannabe Ninjas (not shaming, that's why I twinked a Rogue back then)
---
Is account transfer even going to be possible in classic?
---
I played my druid as balance during retail vanilla in an extremely casually guild.  Because I was terrible at the game, and the entire guild I was in was as well, nobody knew how bad Moonkins truly were (including myself) and I had an absolute blast.  Ignorance is bliss on a sense... now that I know they suck, and understand the game far better, I don’t think I could ever enjoy it again.  Wish I could go back to 2005 when I just played what sounded fun and didn’t care about DPS viability in raids.  Was a simpler, more enjoyable time for me back then.  Now I can’t help but min/max.  Knowledge is a curse I tell you!
---
Karma reaping? I dont get it. There are a lot of good points on these comments and if you used to heal in vanilla I bet there are a lot of different considerations for you.  Unless you are a pretty annoying type of person.  Which I hope you are not
---
I should have elaborated. I was thinking more of the ganking ability and sneaking into capital cities :)
---
15 they stated on Monday.
---
He's implying you sold it like tonnes of other people did at the time (and I was tempted to do)
---
Keep up the awesome work Josh. I look forward to every Wednesday.
---
COUGH THE WORDS I CANT SPEAK SO I STALL MYSELF AGAIN, THEN I FALL TO THE SURFACE!
---
Drowning Pool?
---
"Those years are behind me" ? So you are senior citizen? if you dont have to work that is
---
Younger players and 2019 gaming promote instant gratification and typically 1-3 month gaming cycles 
---
I believe after 5-7 months classic will be made up of 20+ that has played vanilla before.
---
Your argument would be the same against playing priest as well on the Alliance side.  
---
Ya, maybe it sucks but if you aren't focused on PVP it's not as big of a concern.  Understood you still have to make it to 60, but it's doable just a bit frustrating.
---
Loot lists are pretty fair. 
---
Problem with your thing is that it dosen't reward progression. So if i stay up all night wiping on c'thun i don't get anything? I don't see how this is any different from DKP? Once you've cleared raids several times everyone will have 1000s of RIPS, so the new guy doesn't stand a chance anyway, right? So it's a less dynamic DKP that you can combine with a pretty much useless roll.
---
Same thing goes for consumables etc, DKP is usually awarded for participation, engagement, helping with dungeons for pre-raid BIS, farming consumables and resistance gear.
---
Yep, I loved playing my orc shaman with a huge 2h axe in SM and gear smacking things around and getting the satisfying windfury procs!
---
"This is huh.. WoW!"...  (((Burzum)))
---
I played a rogue and mage to 60 in vanilla.  Raided heavily on the rogue through AQ40, swapped to mage in Naxx through 8 bosses before TBC came out, where I continued mage through BT.
---
Having played both extensively, I'll say this; I feel like mage has the higher skill cap. Some folks may disagree, but that's just my personal take fifteen years later.
---
I don't envy your decision, I made it once too. Mage will level easier and be more convenient for travel, rogue will help you avoid ganks and setup your own, allow you to stealth through mobs, open lockboxes, etc.
---
I think rogue armor aesthetics are better at all 3 tiers overall, but the mage tier 3 looks good. You will be a biscuit and water vendor, or a portal producer for strangers all the time.  
---
It honestly depends on your playstyle. Do you want to stealth up and stun-lock an enemy, injecting poisons, backstabbing them with corehound tooth and perdition's blade, weaving around them in your full bloodfang and sneaking back into the shadows?
---
Do you want to lock down and potentially outduel any other class? Silence, frost Nova, cone of cold, pom pyros, blink, counterspell. Mage has tricks for every other class and played well, you can be a real pain to deal with. Both classes pair well with engineering, you would have fun with either. 
---
The real question is, do you want to get in there and get your hands dirty, or do you want to lock someone down from range and bombard them with spells? Your call.
---
Tormund usually shows up in every sub, it's not Bobby B but it's still nice
---
&gt;Will it also attract younger players which are more accustomed to fancier graphics and lots of rewards?
---
I don't know why so many people think this, there is no evidence towards it. If anything it is the opposite. Think about it, who is it that actually have 2080 Ti builds that are capable of 4K gaming or Ultra settings in AAA games? Adults. Despite how we love saying kids are spoiled these days, they are not the people that have high end gaming rigs - adults are. We are the ones that are accustomed to fancy graphics.
---
I guess the assumption comes from "well, adults used to play with bad graphics, so we can tolerate it", but that is just not true, is it? It is increasingly popular to remake all our childhood games with better graphics - *we* are the target audience for good graphics.
---
And on top of that, try to look at some of the biggest modern trends for kids / teenagers. Minecraft, mobile games, Call of Duty, Rocket League etc. are all lower graphic gaming, yet it is some of the most popular for kids and teenagers.
---
Honestly, I think adults are more used to better quality simply because we have more money than teenagers. If the game is fun for all ages then it will attract all ages, despite graphics.
---
It's not either the computer or out with the boys. Believe it or not, but some women actually want to spend time with their partner.
---
I completely agree on first two and completely disagree on 3rd. Neither you nor your RL should waste a debuff slot on Insect Swarm. And DPS for tank, even minor, helps him to keep aggro.
---
OP said he doesn't want to top charts, because he realizes that it's only possible if mages are afk :) And giving a debuff slot is same thing as afking essentially - cripple other's DPS for someone to feel cool.
---
With the amount of skills, stances and stuff to do in classic (if you want to be good that is) with a warrior, i\`d say its far far from boring.
---
Yeah pretty fucked for blizzard to constantly keep doing these sneak things... not too long until classic though!
---
&gt; I never claimed WotLK was when it started 
---
This is literally what this thread is about, and what I called an urban legend, to which you answered. 
---
&gt; Also, you somehow claim that I have no PvP knowledge 
---
I haven't said that.
---
&gt; You're suffering from a hilariously immense lack of reading comprehension. 
---
Ok.
---
&gt; so demanding answers from me just makes you look like a moron 
---
Going into a discussion, mocking somebody while being unable to provide evidence to support your own claims makes ***you*** look like a moron to be honest. You're the only agressive and unpolite person there.
---
Now, if there's nothing but insults left and you won't link me any vid or any sort of argument, it'd be nice if we stopped there.
---
Bruh I hope you're not serious lol.
---
Thanks &lt;3 
---
Maybe you can do a write up of all instances once live hits and submit a guide to Barrens Chat or something (fuck wowhead, they sold their souls to Curse long ago)
---
Nelf female + dwarf male because of animations and dwarf racials
---
Yes.
---
I do it for pvp mainly, im tired of going oom everytime i vipersting spam
---
It was a small portion of the post.  Someone of reason can clearly see that.  Can you?
---
If you want to tank, warrior is your best bet. Raid tank spots are limited, but don't assume you'd have an easier time finding one as a druid, just because there are less druids.
---
Well I didn't know about this so I'm happy he expended the effort and brought it to my attention.
---
Agree
---
[https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq](https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq) this is the wow classic guilds discord. you can find guilds who are going to be rocking classic WoW.
---
I ran as prot on the beta, and was flamed for doing to low dps, in 2 of the dungens i ran.
---
i tryed both fury and arms from 30-40 and worked alot better to tank in those specs, and no one cryed over my low dps.
---
Locks are great duelers, and with a pet they can handle  so much content solo.  If you're already thinking you'd play a role in endgame that won't see much of your time, stay away from resto druid.
---
I dont think you need 4/4 in improved natures grasp. Shaving off .4 seconds from Wrath would help alot more in terms of dps.
---
I will play a troll rogue with an ooga name!
---
I stand corrected - you are right on the 3rd point - I forgot about the debuff limit on Vanilla.
---
Good! I can just play my daily playlist then 🙂
---
I think the levels of autism in here is high enough that people would think I am serious.
---
Same. I'm not pre-addicted though. I'm definitely not.
---
Good luck whith that guild harmony when your bottom tier DPS Boomkin starts wanting Talisman, choker of the firelord, robe of volatile power etc.
---
I almost cried with joy.  68 days can't be over quick enough
---
Try doing one of those things in a spec that is not the corresponding one and see how many people are going to a) invite you, and b) tell you you have a wrong spec.
---
Still undecided on what I want to play in classic. I narrowed it to 3 choices: Paladin, Warlock, Rogue.  
---
Paladin: Since it's a hybrid spec I can switch around specs just for fun or some farming etc. Obviously having holy spec or just being able to heal would make it a lot easier to get groups when leveling and then being a pure healer at max level. Also from what I heard it's the hardest healer class to kill, because of the plate armor and all of the tricks and "oh shit" spells, that paladins have. They can wear all type of gear, so gearing up a paladin might be a lot easier, compared to other healing/dps classes that use only one type of armor. "Free mount" is also quite a good deal. Main problem for me, is that it seems like paladin leveling is slow as hell with only boring auto attacks and few judgements at your disposal.
---
Warlock: Seems like an interesting class with interesting theme, and less played from what I heard that might be beneficial while looking for groups. Summons, pets, stones, ress all seem like a useful things to have that speed up leveling or get you out of some situations. "Free mount" too, just like with paladin. Main con I see in lock's gameplay, is that a lot of his spells are dots and not much of a direct gamage, so that might get boring after a while.  
---
Rogue: This one seems like really fun class to play with stealth, stuns, poisons, lockpicking, pickpocketing and all the other stuff that they have in their arsenal. But the main thing that keeps me from rolling one is that from what I heard, rogues are one of the most played classes while only having a dps spec. That means there might be tons of competition with gear and just getting into dungeons in general.  
---
Having all 3 of these classes at 60 would be the best choice obviously. But since I'm planning on playing casually, getting all of the to max level might take a while. So I need to somehow choose one of them that I will play first/main.
---
Launch of nukes, maybe.
---
I think you made the right choice if you were heavily addicted prior. That's a responsible decision. 
---
I'm going to give it a go, again, and this time with self-control and not self-indulgence x999999. :D
---
Or hunters. Hunter/mage alts are going to be popular.
---
&gt;The time investment required to reach endgame and play the game properly is not something that the younger generation are use to these days. 
---
Neither was most people that played during vanilla, many people never tried anything near that time investment. It is a minority that was used to EverQuest and such games.
---
And this time around, at least speaking for myself, I'm not used to such time investment anymore. That is exactly why I'm hyped, to try it again because I don't like the opposite.
---
If anything, teenagers and kids  are exactly the people with time to spare for this investment, as opposed to many adults with full time jobs.
---
Vanilla have already proven that it is a great game for all ages, absolutely no reason to think it is any different now.
---
It's not about the class, it's about the faction/class combo. Your only defense mechanism is fear. Horde has a Race that can become immune to it for an extended period of time. It tilts you off the face of the earth to get ganked by undead all day long.
---
Tanks will ALWAYS be needed
---
Owahahaha down with a sickness
---
I just splooged
---
How about AV? I honestly don’t remember locks well in vanilla, probably why they’re so appealing to me right now.
---
He was joking. He later clarified he wasn't being serious
---
He looks like he got his head stuck in a hydraulic press
---
Why would people spend time in this subreddet if they dont intend to play the game???
---
In MC and for trash, absolutely. A weapon swap macro to a shield is huge in a pinch. Post MC, most bosses are immune to taunt (that's why KTM is important), but a mentally prepared DPS warrior can still save the raid from a full wipe occasionally, for example on 3 drakes in BWL if wing buffet taunting goes bad.
---
Warrior
---
It's an interesting question, wrong subreddit tho
---
Oooh, tough. But I mean alliance leveling is softer on the eyes. Even if it's harder to get to all the dungeons around the map.
---
Probably economically successful.
---
Its super easy to level. And one of the fastest 1 by 1 mob killing machine after L40. The difference is that you can grind for a hour and not drink or eat once while doing that.
---
You're right, I feel ashamed but I'm all out of questions and I must post something...
---
I'm sorry.
---
Female orc hunter is thicky thicc though
---
DUDE i am laughing so hard indestructible was my go to album
---
Where did you see this survey? I needs to know!
---
Classic Warri tanking was so fun though, with stance dancing and actually having to take care of aggro. So much more involved and so different from DDing, much unlike live Warrior.
---
The Nicker (axe)
---
Diddling kids?
---
I think between 40 and 60, until everyone starts scaling up with raid gear, shadow priests are by a margin the strongest 1v1 class in the game. You don't even have to play smart, shield dot mind blast mind flay shield again when you can, fear if you have to drop shadowform to heal. Most classes can't break through the second PW:S before they're dead, and the few that can just make for a slightly grindier match-up. The priest wins every time unless they don't have mana at the start of the fight.
---
Hey man gaming addiction is a real thing and I’m proud you’re making the healthy choice, but why post in this subreddit?
---
Spot on. This is also the biggest problem of current wow - everyone only sees the end game and ignores trashes any other content. Even retail wow has lot of other content and things to do if you can only bother to try and look beyond mythic+ and raids
---
IF should be the primary capital in every sense. Why be in an exposed open top city when you can hide in a fucking MOUNTAIN?! Totally impenetrable and also super cosy.
---
this is you
---
Also, to tack on to some of the concerns you've stated, there is also no real good way to capture the fact that for a lot of people they won't really have a 'main'. Instead, they will ptobably switch back and forth between multiple classes when they get bored of playing one or another.
---
I imagine classes like rogue, warrior, and mage are a bit more 'fantasy cookie-cutter' and so people are more likely to play them as alts. Which is why the poll might not show a class like rogues as highly ranked as we might expect.
---
90% of the reason I'm playing classic is to see old Thousand Needles again.
---
The other 10% is because retail sucks ass.
---
Couldn't give less of a shit about vanilla raiding.
---
Any half decent raiding/pvp guild has certain standards regarding the command of english you need to have in order to join
---
That must be the reason why Tool waited so long to release a new album.  They were waiting for Classic Wow.
---
Killer threat management?
---
Hahaha! So many switch fan-bois here :D
---
No, the talent is almost at best decent if you're good at the game.
---
Sustain is good, but the amount of life you get from this talent is just ridiculous and can hardly be considered sustain. You have a way better time healing your pet with mend pet and drinking every now and then. 
---
You must be out of combat for long periods of time because questing in vanilla is made that way. And most of the time even when there's 30 enemies close by that you have to kill for a quest, the time gain from this talent compared to any other talent (pathfinding which is never recommended for some reason) is just so low that it's not worth taking.
---
And if you're playing on a pvp server you should do your best to stay full hp (at least on your character). It's so easy to kill someone walking around with 50% hp. Hence why your pet should be tanking 80-90% of the time (obviously since shooting is more dps and he's much more tanky than you are). So this talent's usefulness is just halved if you don't wanna get ganked. And to lots of classes a full life hunter is too annoying to deal with to gank so you're gonna be left alone most of the time (except when outnumbered).
---
I understand that you disagree, but the numbers don't lie. And the spell doom for this talent.
---
Thank you for your contribution.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Don't forget the difficulty of getting MC on farm vs your newest Heroic or maybe Mythic. 40 people vs 10-25 with vastly higher time requirements.
---
I don't see anyone mentioning Apocalyptica! From Swifty's incredible warrior tricks.
---
*WHY THE HELL ARE YOU TRYIN*
---
*WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUUU*
---
For me your statement is weird. I listen mostly to heavy metal bands from Europe since I was a kid and hardly found good music from this side of the Atlantic.
---
No, I was in the opposite boat, poor family from Eastern Europe, no chance in hell they would ever pay for this, now that I can pay I will.
---
The information they’ve given so far is that one of the servers will be named “Mankriks Wife”
---
Lmao, yeah just call in sick
---
One word. front flipping night elf hunters.
---
&gt;  hardly found good music from this side of the Atlantic.
---
Good music or specifically heavy metal? Because that statement in isolation is insane.
---
You can PvP just fine without raid gear https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFqXph5wEzc
---
World of roguecraft?
---
Moonfire :)
---
And the best death animations.
---
If you don't make a troll hunter, what are you even doing?
---
Familiars will know what it's like to be born male in a chicken factory.
---
nobody except Naxx will get twoshotted when your tanks have worldbuffs and 9k HP in BWL. FOr hard hitting Bosses you simply put on a shield and tank furyprot SnB. At some Bosses like Lashlayer you just dualwield then right before Mortal Strike you switch to SnB and use shieldblock -&gt; voila no crit/crush and still way superior TPS.  
---
Sure it's not optimal nor needed for casual guilds but any guild with decent pushing DPS will have no problem at all DW furyprotting their way through the 1-2 hours Progress for new content.
---
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOKES
---
15 and you can do DM, RFC, WC if you want.
---
Playing priest: I plan on leveling with herb/mining or herb/skinning  and selling any good mats on AH.
---
At 60 I would respec to enchanting/tailoring most likely. Is it going to be a bitch to level enchanting/tailoring from 0 once I hit 60 or is it not too bad? I feel like it wouldn't take too long... But never done it.
---
Why would i be here then?
---
Ofc what was i thinking.
---
Dude this is what the game developers said during their interview. Just tap into your imagination and think of a way this could go wrong. The situation he gave is a little much, but internal documents could easily get confused. Forums display realm names, their cross realm technology’s obviously works with realm names somehow. The possibilities are extensive just off the top of ones head
---
I already planned my summer vacation to start with classic wow
---
Yes, people should be skilled with the class they are playing. Yes, most people aren't.
---
Stone-Form 
---
Or Rep Bonus and sword and Mace Skill
---
Do you plan on raiding?
---
South Park writes and produces their shows within the week that they release. It's how they are able to do shows about current events while they're current.
---
You're not the only one. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how much ArP I want on my arms in WotLK - what gem to socket, what gear to buy... Barely actually DPSed.
---
As a warrior you can easily find tank spots in dungeons.  However, tank spots in raids are more tricky.
---
What would the main advantages and Disadvantages of playing a Mage over a Lock? I want to play Horde. I will mainly be doing PVP/World PVP and not Raids.
---
I didn’t ask for accuracy, I asked for relevance.
---
Thx
---
DKP is the best and fairest way in my opinion.  You earn more DKP the more you raids you attend. If an item drops, then you have chance to bid what YOU think its worth. This way, the frequent attendee's get more DKP and can bid as much or little they believe an item is worth to them. Casual raiders still get DKP, and will get upgrades after the frequent raiders are geared.
---
In the survey were aprox 1750 DPS warriors and 2150 Tank warrios
---
It was a joke bro, chill. Although I would love to be &gt;!shagged!&lt; by some nelfs in the middle of IF 🥺😩
---
Love how family and wife are separate. I mean, it makes sense but it's still funny to me.
---
Dark side of the Moon and Clubbed to Death for me
---
It depends what type of PVP you’re talking about, 1v1, bgs or large scale open world etc. generally warlocks and warriors scale best with gear
---
Wife is at a higher level bro...
---
That’s definitely the BFA patch
---
My boiii, same here =D
---
America will be short on locks, apparently.
---
We all have different experiences based on our group of friends, what was popular in our school or also in your city/country. I'm from EU and rock/punk music was big thing when I was growing up (born 1993). I remember listening to all of these bands back in Vanilla/BC days.
---
I disagree, sw is pure kino and awesome for duels.
---
Surely Undead Warrior would be closest to a DK?
---
I am an old-timer.  I remember when there were no add-ons, no one knew about quests / quests rewards; and how the hell do you get to Tristifal Glades when you're a Tauren who hasn't left The Barrens?  
---
There are many, MANY epic questlines to follow in Classic Wow that will allow you hours of entertainment, frustration, and joy once completed.
---
There are many, many HOURS of fun to be had in the Battle Grounds, fine-tuning your skills, having some one-on-one battles and shit-talk...  
---
And to be honest -- there are some EPIC FIGHTS to be had in the dungeons IF you do them at the proper level.  Our group would scream with joy when at 4 levels under the end boss we would "win".  And we'd go back and do it again.  
---
I would sit in BG's with friends begging me to "raid" -- and literally say, unless it's learning a new boss or raid -- I've done my 40-hour workweeks getting Rag and his sons down and now it's nurfed to hell and back and not longer a challenge.
---
Some of the more epic quests need to be part of WoW for everyone, The Battle of Darrowshire, the questlines between Scholo and Stratholme, all of the BRD quests -- you just feel empowered when your group / friends are able to complete them.
---
Variety is the spice of WoW life.  But be careful, there are those out there, even in Vanilla, who will try to manipulate your WoW experience be it with rewards from raiding, BG's, etc.  Play your game.
---
You're a melee class without stealth, mediocre armor until lvl40, very gear dependant, slow swing timers (as arms anyways) so parry/dodge/misses are pretty punishing, moreso because they starve you of rage.
---
Your only non AA rage generators are charge and berserker rage, one of which costs you a sizeable amount of health (at lower levels anyways) and the other is not available if you pull at range to avoid aggroing to many mobs by charging in.
---
Unlike Paladins or Shamans you lack utility and healing, so once you're in a fight you're in a fight. No earthbind totem kiting, no hammer of justice, no bubble, no heals, no Vanish, no Blind... your only defense being intimidating shout, which may just make your situation that much worse.
---
I know there's been a lot of people saying "it's not as bad as some people think they remember" but I honestly don't see what makes up for all these issues with Warriors.
---
I certainly don't see how any other class is harder to level than Warriors, even if they're not as bad as I remember them. Some may be slower (Paladin), Mages had to constantly drink ... but none of them lived as dangerously as a Warrior, who has no way out of a fight, has no range, no utility, no heals... only damage. So if you ever get ganked or an unlucky streak of dodge/miss/parry you're just kinda fucked.
---
Well performance is not the only point on a loot council you know 😜 take your grain of salt and get blown in the wind 😘
---
I THINK I want to play a Priest on Alliance side.  
---
Either Nelf or Hooman, probably Nelf for the less populated starting zones.
---
joke's on whoever bought it lol
---
There better be someone duct-taped to the ceiling, playing.
---
The first thing you linked is what I tried to follow as I was doing some testing on a private server and to me the lowest obtainable level for some of the swords isn't feasible.  Unless someone high level is running you through WC the wing blade isn't a level 14 weapon.  More like 18-20 that's why I changed my progression.  Also I started following Joannas guide and this swords fall more in line with that guide.
---
A smart woman doesn't tie herself to a manchild.
---
oops. KLH Threat Meter (KTM), which is widely used as a threat tracking addon on 1.12.1.
---
That's why I said everyone I ever knew from EUROPE. I've played CS with people from entire Scandinavia and WoW with a crossection of Europe. This isn't limited to my back yard.
---
That’s what I figured but I wanted to be sure. Thank you
---
People who bought it broke the ToS so I won't judge much. I'd never buy accounts
---
What I like about Vanilla is that you don't need to know every small detail to make a meaningful contribution, like you did :)
---
Mathematically speaking, any spell power increase on your gear tips the scale in pvp. 
---
As magic damage is not reduced by armor, the armor increase on your enemy is void. Therefore, spell damage classes like shamans, warlocks, mages, priest, and balance druids will have the most growth in later gear sets. 
---
The only thing offset by this is stamina, and that is the only thing preventing classes from getting one shotted by your spells. Spells stay stationary outside spell power, while damage from melee scales from agility/strength/weapon damage. It is also why in later expansions intellect became the main source of increased spell power to prevent spell stagnation. 
---
Yes, melee wise rogues, warriors, and hunters do get good, BUT.. classes like hunters stagnate since pets dont scale at all in damage and as other peoples defenses scale, your pets attack does not. 
---
TL;DR  Shamans will 2 shot you at max power.
---
How do I upvote more than once?
---
Yeah, they won't put this joke back
---
Because the Tauren idle animation is them scratching themselves.
---
&gt;although neither is available for Warlocks so there is that
---
Gnome Warlock is a thing btw.
---
don't forget mind control
---
TIL Gnomes can't be warlocks.
---
The only issue I see is that they would still be the same age so it would be a little weird. It would be halarious to see them as adults with kids and shit trying to get back into Wow, their would be tons of material to work off of, but that's not gonna happen.
---
Actually sounds familiar
---
I was thinking of doing the same. I know I don't need prot spec for dungeons but I like it and I am in no rush. 
---
I'm really excited to give tanking a shot in Classic. Strangely enough the only thing I'm worried about are the vets freaking out while I learn.
---
not true, they only are good for damage long-term battles because they dont run on mana.
---
Thanks for a great reply. I have traditionally enjoyed the ranged role in most games I have played, so maybe that's my answer. I have leveled 3 hunters to 60, so it is time to try something new.
---
rogues mages at first, after that warriors warlocks hunters and the rare shadow priest.
---
Likely gonna end up as Huntards
---
https://youtu.be/VDvr08sCPOc
---
Having a free mount and being extremely easy to level certainly helps.. Highly doubt it's simply due to people talking about how good locks are.
---
One of the gold farmers from my gold farmer guild (I was collecting them) got Knight Captain. A few others had ranks too.
---
If you’re worrying about the slight differences in the pieces as to which is BiS or are in a progression guild (which usually leads to thoughts regarding the former), you are probably expected to try to better your character within reason (note: leveling 1 single profession to max isn’t unreasonable). This could be imposed by yourself or the 40+ other people you are playing with.
---
Since we’ll have roughly ~6+ months until BWL is released and then the wait in line for T2 chest (since yay ~4 pieces off a 40man boss), you may have a 10+ month wait before you upgrade an item you could get before you reach level cap. So truefaith would be at least some form of minor character progressional that item slot, which can be slowly worked toward over the course of a few weeks or couple months.
---
You didn't finish reading my examples did you?
---
So what's the percentage of tanks to everything else in the survey?
---
I'm fairly sure some youtuber (probably Bellular?) mentioned they are not willing to invest so many resources and money to a project that has such low value and high risk. Something along those lines.   
---
But honestly, I feel like WoW 2.0 with a brand new engine, systems redesigned to last through time instead of being replaced next expansion and a free to play model could attract a lot of players and keep the old ones engaged.
---
You got that Lokth guy on again? The guy brings down the whole podcast. Get rid of him!
---
It would honestly not surprise me, because there are some serious no-lifers in this sub. To each their own though, I guess.
---
Fair enough. I haven’t played in a long time haha.
---
Love that it’s looking like 50/50 for Classic!
---
He's on the subreddit, it's not like he's a complete newbie. Even then I played warriors when I knew nothing, never even heard of the hamstring thing, it's not that bad. I never had the experience you described because it's just not my mindset to be mad at some other class killing mobs faster.
---
Generally these things come down more to expectations than practice playing WoW specifically. If you played games like Dark Souls or EQ it's not that different of an experience.
---
Sure, people can hoard for that one weapon they want, but they can still roll on other gear and hope for a good roll unlike in a dkp system where you have to "buy" the item.
---
So probably full fury for me and shadow for DPS for her?
---
Ret isn't even in the same ballpark as Enhance for PvP lol.
---
Renew is best if you have 1 dedicated priest witj imp. Renew that has to keep up renew on tanks and warlocks.   
---
And ofc its also fine in 5 mans.
---
but why do you not want to let new people go the competitive route and ask for BiS in raids? besides, it's clearly not 150h of raiding and 200h of leveling.
---
leveling is a part of the game, and for some it's the main part, and that's fine. but some people want the competitive challenge of raiding even if they haven't played classic before, and that's also fine.
---
I'd agree with your assessment tho that the most important decision about your toon is that ylu like him/her, otherwise you will not want to play.
---
Nightfall proc, Nightfall proc, Nightfall proc, Nightfall proc...
---
Playing Warlock in BGs on the PBE (the PBEs where you got decked out premade chars) was fucking hilarious. Dot everything with Corruption and then railgun away with instant Shadowbolts. It's incredible how whine Warlocks used to be in classic about being soooo weak. Outside of having to deal with WotF (which frankly such major balls) they were hella strong.
---
I will have money for mount to all my friends and won't farm any mobs.
---
&gt;OP is the fun gatekeeper.
---
Where did this stupid gatekeeper word come from? We used to just call it difference of opinion. Now these days we use the word gatekeeping to just invalidate someones opinion because its easier than making an actual argument.
---
Sigh..
---
I think for speedrunners STV *is* a possibility even on PvP server. It's not so dangerous when no one's there yet.
---
Saw them live in Osaka ten years later. Felt like a dream come true.
---
Destro isn't really "shit", it's basically 10% behind SM/Ruin and 15% behind DS/Ruin.
---
Yes but each server wont be split. Most servers will have at least a 40-60 split one way or the other, with a lot of the more popular servers being heavily skewed.
---
Once your in raid mode the grind &amp; time commitment isnt far off from what's needed in retail. Yes it takes longer to get to Max level &amp; obtain pre-raid gear, but, once your doing raids with the guild it's similar to the 2-3 nights a week that people do on retail. 
---
Understand your point of view though. That initial time commitment is much more then most individuals are willing to commit to. 
---
I personally took 7 PTO days and told the wife what the deal was. Time is money friend, that's what the goblins always said. If you look at Classic through those eyes, many will change their approach to the game. IE: is it worth farming for hours on end or just go to work and then spend $100 on gold?
---
but some people read that lvling and dps guide because they want to be on top
---
Is playing a human lock actually that stupid? Wotf is a 2 min cooldown and surely you could just bait it by double fearing?
---
He dispelled so fast that the enemy mage opened a ticket to report that polymorph was not working lol
---
It's relevant
---
Nope! I cant wait till release to be able to play again. I loved playing wow, pottering away on different characters, questing, instancing, pvping...loved it. 
---
I didnt realise at the time, but tBC &amp; Wrath good, but that whole level playing field again was rubbish as far my opinion goes. I have a wife and kids and stopped playing after my 1st kid was born. But they are older now, and I miss gaming. I'm looking forward to playing away after they are in bed, sitting on the sofa talking with the wife. I plan to raid 1 maybe 2 times a week, in a casual guild. Most of all, I am happy to play on a classic server where the level cap wont change. I'll be happy playing away for 5-6 even more yrs on a classic server.  Roll on the 27th Aug! :D
---
Born and bred stupid, thats why.
---
&gt;Loot council? Fuck. That.
---
good argument
---
If 0.2 seconds wipe you, you'd wipe anyway.
---
10 rage isnt that much in dps. You are going to be in ARMs spec, so you have anger management. When most of your damage comes from autoattacks... the damage reduction is huge tho. Havent done a warrior in beta (and forgot to test this in AV test when we had L58's), but in private servers this worked amazingly well.
---
If you use a slow 2-h, you are essentially taking 50% less damage (most mobs are attacking at 1.5s or something in that range) and dropping maybe 5% dps. Another thing i like about it is, that you should be pulling towards the next mob ANYWAYS, so you are already dragging mobs around, might as well not get hit while at it.

The very first video I saw of WoW was of a level 52 shaman fighting a level 52 paladin with Slipknot - Duality playing.
---
/inc C&amp;D letter
---
Which way are you leaning right now?
---
As I said, the numbers might need adjustment and by completing a raid I mean staying until the end of the raid. Sure, people who have 300 or so points can dominate players who have 0 points, but that is to be expected and I would consider it to be UNFAIR for new players to be able to compete with the most dedicated players.
---
How you acquire the points can be the same as for DKP, although I personally never liked the idea of rewarding people for guild interaction, because it leads to a meta where people only care about helping the guild for some points rather than an intrinsic motivation.
---
honestly the "ally warlock is bad" memes have spread too far, they are actually super useful in BG's, it's just wpvp that is slightly weaker, and it's not even that bad because all the undead match ups are either default won or lost without will of the forsaken even playing much of a factor.
---
You can play however you want. However that privilege ends the moment you step into a raid with 39 other players.
---
If you are the person that consistently do 50% less damage than the other people of your same class because you could not be bothered googling which stats to go for or what your hitcap is, then dont be surprised when you are the first to get replaced when the guild run into any sort of trouble down the line.
---
People these days simply have a lot more knowledge than back then. Not taking advantage of this knowledge that has been compiled over 15 years, and thus being a burden to 39 other people is obviously not ok.
---
STV is essential and still the best xp/hr even with a few deaths. For speed running you are only going to run into other runners by the time you get to STV. For general levelling you try to group up to deter pvp and play cautious.
---
I don’t grind between 20-30, questing is faster and more efficient on Classic Beta!

Paint drying is much more fun. Seeing that shiny wet coat shapeshift into the color of your choice.

Kids aren't a necessity bruh. My gf and I don't want kids. We're happy being able to do shit without some brat clinging at our legs.
---
Distortion Sleep, Nerve, Stabbing the Drama hhnnnggg. Because of PvP videos they ended up becoming my favorite band and still are to this day. Their past few albums have been amazing. The Living Infinite is flawless.
---
It's quite doable! I'm in EU region but play on NA servers because most of my friends are over there.
---
Ping is quite reasonable - I was mythic raiding in Legion during Nighthold/TOS/Antorus, and even managed to get mage towers done without too much difficulty.
---
The time zone difference is a bit of a pain for raiding, but workable if you find the right guild.
---
I think somewhere around 7 billion ppl not going to play.
---
Boo this man
---
I really don't get the appeal of Alliance. I used to play Alliance and likely will again because my friends did/will - but ... why?
---
Horde seems thematically cooler (UD, Trolls), has better racials, Windfury - the roided up males don't look as ridiculous as Human males...
---
Any takers? I'd really like to know what the appeal is. Do you prefer the cities (IF/SW)? Paladins? A change from live?

---
No one was stopping you last time either - we easily did RFC at level 10 last time
---
Been on private servers, so my own expirence isn't 100% what's going to be on classic but no, warriors are not harder than your average class, they are actually on the lower end in terms of difficulty. In terms of leveling, they are hard for a first timer, but if you know to cook and level first aid it's fairly easy.
---
WE HATE MINMAX crowd... you just presented random information without actually knowing anything about downranking penalty. Its like everyother post in here "HeY!!! Ret actually could be good, just get alot of hit, AP gear and SP gear wtf nubs?" back to retail pls, I surely hope I dont see you at my server.
---

Best server ever
---
But you don't really bid. You "buy" an item and you start bidding if multiple people want it. Say 2 guys with 2k DKP each want the same weapon that costs 1.5k DKP but another item drops that costs 500DKP and both could benefit from. What would often happen is that both would pass, because they don't want to pass up the chance to get the weapon and the item would get disenchanted. With this system they both could just roll for it without having to sacrifice any points they might need for a different item. 
---
Also I think that there is always going to be a problem with systems that reward more active players and people wanting to save up points for the best loot like Thunderfury or some other stuff. Just part of the system I guess.
---
So what you are telling me, is that you two will then fight on the names of your toons?
---
My pleasure duder
---
Need some perspective from more experienced Vanilla players - as a disclaimer I'm fairly familiar with all classes, I find them well designed and enjoyable at what they do best and I don't exactly have a preference, let alone a faction preference :)
---
I was not too bad a PvPer back when Vanilla was retail but I haven't really played since so most of the pserver crowd is going to sensibly outplay me if I roll a Mage or Rogue.
---
For this reason I'm keen on playing more as a support this time around and enable better pvp'ers than I am in BGs.
---
That being said BG is not 100% of the playtime (more like 0% in case 1 and 2 anyway) and Pugging can be rough so I'd like to be able to somewhat hold my own solo queuing as damage/support or in world PvP.
---
Add to that the usual "I don't have much playtime" (although I'd really like to experience at least MC and BWL...) so I'll need a class that doesn't have a hard time finding raid groups (pug or alt guild runs most likely).
---
I know how to prepare so I'll invest time in BIS gearing for the optimal spec and I'll roll Engineering for the goodies. I don't mind respeccing although being able to do both PvP/solo farm/pve in one spec is an obvious plus.
---
Currently eyeing Shaman as the offense is juicy however the support is not what Paladins or Priests can put out and those 2 are my other options. Also remember Shaman being fairly easy to lock down with CC and they don't have much durability.
---
Paladins I'm worried of the offense side (during solo play, I'll play pure support in group PVP) unless I get a good 2 hander and I don't think this will happen with my limited playtime.
---
Priests are cool, just worried about survivability (so I'd go Troll for more blackout procs and play TriSpec most likely) and overall not looking at a very exciting offensive playstyle when solo - and that's even truer for Pallies although there is something about swinging a 2 ha dear that is quite satisfying.
---
Thanks for reading the wall of text and appreciate any feedback.
---
Cheers guys and see you in August!
---
Yeah and communism works.
---
You forgot drowning pool
---
So tired of all the pve nerds who obsess over raiding. There is no fun in fighting AI controlled enemies. It's all about the pvp for me. Had this attitude in vanilla, still the same in classic.
---
Fuck me...
---
But you still end up with a completely unavoidable problem for no benefit.
---
Big BGs are hard to gauge, I did not play a lock in vanilla so I don't recall how potent they were in AV.  I believe they were mostly just dotting enemies through hills and throwing shadowbolts.  It's not flashy, but you deal a lot of damage to many targets slowly.  It's also a good class that should see a lot of uptime because you're not on the front line, so you're alive more often than others and feel like you can contribute.  Or at least... that's my expectation and recollection of it.
---
Human warrior has to be one of the most challenging classes to level. Your best bet is to knock out quests as quickly as possible to level 6, then pair up with a dps and smash out some grinding for a couple levels in a less busy spot. The Murloc lake is pretty good and the respawn is fast. Get to 8 then quest as much as you can to 10. Do your class quest. If you have a plan despite being a warrior this should keep you up the top if not ahead.  Prioritise your weapon progression list.
---
shamans only shine in elemental late late game
---
Too much book keeping.  I wouldn't use DKP for the same reason.
---
Wife? Divorced
---
Kids? Sold
---
Work? LoL
---
My body is ready
---
Doesn't that count as Charm, which WotF also immunitizes against?
---
&gt;  (i would do it all over again) 
---
Apparently you would not!
---
Yeah, one of my fears is that the handful of elitist players will force Bli$$ard to relase new content before many could experience it as a whole as the $treamers must go on with the show and they need new content. I seriously hope the phases come slow enough for most of the people to see endgame in Phase 1 and don't reach level 60 when Naxx is already out and the War Effort is long forgotten...
---
SL warlock is the strongest thing in classic wow pvp...
---
I'm convinced most people who are going to nolife classic didn't have but 1 of the 4 beforehand.
---
&gt;Dueling should be about who is better at their class though
---
Well yeah. Which is why you pot and use engineering gadgets.
---
A player not willing to go the extra mile to win is not a good player. Besides, Vanilla isnt balanced. Take Paladin f.ex. Without engineering you are already at a drastic disadvantage over other classes. Engineering has multiple gap closing abilities, and the Paladin class has no natural gap closers outside of Repentance in deep Ret.
---
Complaining that players use every advantage they can is something bad players do when they lose.
---
"Durr you only won because you used X. If I had used Y I would have won"
---
Why didnt you then?
---
"Hurr because its cheating durr"
---
Some dkp systems actually expect/require you to put in for items that are upgrades for you, so you can’t just pass on everything to guarantee you get the Uber Weapon of Awesomeness.
---
But then, some guilds that do this also tend to forego dkp for specifically super powerful items. Example: Thunderfury. They wouldn’t leave the recipient of their first TF up to DKP cuz some asshole hunter or mage would stockpile their points just to guarantee they got it.
---
Oh? You're approaching me?
---
It is when the goal is **"commit time to a video game"**
---
i played amage 13 years ago and i will play one now. FOTM or not, i dont care :D
---
correction: AV is out in Phase "3" not "2" ;) so ur still gonna have to wait until BWL for that hammer
---
DKP was actually the best system to get TF on a non warrior.
---
I though way more would get into the stress test today, actually everyone (i know it sounds a little crazy), but i woke up pretty dissappointed, let me just put it that way.
---
&gt;Ya 1 hour instead of 3 would be nice, but I'd rather spend the extra 2 hours raiding then how ever many hours farming to get the consumables
---
1 hour with 40 players all being online at the same time and focusing on the same task is infinitely more valuable than the two hours you spent getting world buffs though.
---
You cant just look at the total time it takes.
---
I never had an issue, though I did use engineering quite heavily.
---
DKP is a good theory, like communism, everyone earn the same no matter if they are a doctor or janitor. The janitors are super happy while the doctors usually move to a place where they get better rewarded for their effort. The janitor who saved all his dkp and raids in green gear and do crap dps is super happy when he wins thunderfury on his pala.
---
Whatever it takes.
---
My thinking is that the system in fact is not broken, is working as intended, to help the guild clear the content and therefore over complicating it is unnecessary. The only downside to DKP imo is point hoarding and this can be easily ameliorated by the simple expedient of a DKP cap. Add a fixed DKP cost per item and you are good to go. All thats required then is to figure out how the points are earned. We went with a combination of: Time spent in raid + Points for boss kills. With no points being awarded for bosses downed enough to be considered 'on farm'.  I guess at the end of the day though it's whatever works for you.
---
Goldshire is the primary capital for alliance scum!
---
lol oh please, they don't need to, any discussion on spec performance is shut down instantly by those who feel the need to resort to call other people "crying" when they point out facts.
---
If facts offend you, you may want to get off the internet for a while. It'd be better for everyone.
---
&gt; Your argument would be the same against playing priest as well on the Alliance side. 
---
Yes, but Priests are highly sought after so that makes up for it. It's basically a guarantueed Dungeon/Raid spot, unlike Warlocks.
---
&gt;I view it as a benefit for someone who wants to play Warlock on Alliance, less competition for raid spots.
---
Yea if you have the guts to pull through with it or plan to stay grouped up with your friends anyways, you'll have a good time at maxlevel outside of getting ganked while farming 200 Soulshards for the Naxxramas progression night, the only thing more tedious than preparing 400 water for the raid at 2 a pop where one cast costs you 1/4 of your mana so for every 8 you create you have to drink one for 30 seconds to continue. Haha god I love classic (no sarcasm)
---
&gt; Flying is bad.
---
Only on PVP servers.
---
Well, then we're still back to items going to people where it's not the most beneficial to the guild.
---
The benefit is that people can get items without investing any points. Which in a "true" DKP system is impossible since you have to pay for every item with your DKP points. Less items would go to waste overall and the newer people with less points wouldn't have to spend all their points on "shitty" gear just to catch up with the rest. I think that's a benefit tbh, but I understand your position.
---
I'll play retail when the new expansion comes out to check it out and give it a fair shake
---
„Figured out how to make classic work“ like we haven‘t been playing on vanilla servers for over 10 years now.
---
I'm in the same boat personally.  With Classic, I've decided to try new things and step into a role I never played.  Maybe now's the time to follow suit for you and play the rogue.  Good rogues were truly feared in Vanilla.
---
Whatever you choose, go with it 100%.  They both play well in PvP, and PvE endgame.  They both have a lot of tools, and they're both fun.
---
Decay/EPGP solves most of the issues with DKP.
---
Do you not realize it was literally meant to discourage alliance from playing warlocks all along???  To not ruin the class / race fantasy of the powerful underworld demon undead. Much like how playing a shadow priest only fits an undead. 
---
Alliance got their share of mages because gnomes and humans and whatnot, the arcane mind or some shit.
---
I'm looking for a class that will do well as a solo player. With my work schedule, I can't commit to a consistent raid schedule. So I want something that won't have issues pugging raids. Also, my main focus is probably going to be PvP. Lots of BGs and world PvP. I want something that can do well in both of those, and can 1v1 / 1vX. 
---
With that criteria, I was thinking warlock or hunter...but I'm just not sure!
---
No I am not hating on min max crowd at all.  Not sure you read this post above.  Lots of good different points around in these comments but not sure what your point is?
---
Exactly what I was thinking, this post confuses me on a few levels.
---
I dont understand. Playing the game and keeping tabs on it are two completely different things right?
---
I guess im living vicariously through the sub eh? Its still nostalgic nonetheless; i decided to post this after the new wave of memes about having no social life and was curious
---
randy and the adult dads get back into WoW while the kids make fun of them for it, but slowly change their minds as they see the adults having a blast
---
Man am I glad that I'm single and a student. "Grown up" life sounds terrible if you can't have any control over the very limited free time you have.
---
I wasn't voicing an opinion about the viability of human warlocks but about the ridiculousness of gnomes !
---
I never played a high lvl  warlock and it was 15 years ago anyway, so my opinion is just theory based.
---
But I don't see how can you survive a melee sitting on you if deathcoil isn't up and said melee can't be feared or seduced.
---
Of course he could be on CD too, but he also has a trinket that removes fears.
---
Same here
---
So just because I don't enjoy Disturbed I'm edgy
---
UbiGeofram:
---
&gt; There's also people that think Blizzard is ever going to spend a single dollar developing new content for Classic. Idiots all around.
---
Don't forget to quote him guys, so he can't just delete the post and you'll forget what this was all about lol
---
&gt;  I think that's a benefit tbh
---
That's because you're comparing it to other bad loot systems.
---
You got this picture mixed up with your selfie
---
The fact that the mods had to have a whole huge debate (the result of which many people are not happy about) whether or not to have classicwow content on r/wow should tell you something. If you can't infer, then idk.
---
Hello!
---
1) Is it possible to ignore STV till like level 40? Which zones I should take on 30-40 route then? I dont want to waste time there during the first week.
---
2) What are the worst early chokepoints at early levels (1-30) that I should try to avoid or rush before everyone else?
---
But that stun resist tho......
---
The fix is getting access to beta.
---
I feel like folks making these posts are trying to convince themselves of a playstyle, looking for reassurance and affirmation.
---
&gt;I know this slipped under most current players' radar, but this was a huge problem. It affected the game much more than it seems anyone in this thread wants to admit and—ironically—the anti-Blizzard blinders are actually causing ya'll to let Blizzard slide on this. Not offering a legitimate way to RMT in 2018 is like   
---
&gt;a company bringing out a 100% replica of a Model-A Ford without any seat belts  
---
&gt; and trying to legitimately sell this to consumers. And a crowd of idiots defending the decision because muh nostaliga.
---
It was not such a big problem as stated: There was always the risk that blizzard will shut down your account. True, some people bought money from these chinese gold farmers but the threat of beeing banned was a huge barrier. Therefore only a minority bought ingame currency and the ingame economy was not affected. And, a minor point is: The money was farmed, be it bots or chinese gold farmer workers, it was farmed nontheless and therefore was dictated by spawn timers, pvp-encounters and other players farming in that specific region.
---
In contrast, giving players the opportunity to buy ingame currency for real money in a legal way, leads to an uncontrollable inflation and an ingame-econonmy-change. The ingame money comes out of nowhere and does not affect respawn timers of NPCs etc. This change of the economy in fact would change the whole system. E.g. the repair costs for tanks were always something they had to keep in mind. With an inflation its just negligible. Thats not good at all. 
---
Furthermore, blizzard is implementing Classis WoW on the new code infrastructure. There are better and more ways to prevent gold sellers, cheaters, hackers etc., not to mention that there are better methods to identify players who bought gold and punish them (see the private servers). So why exchange a problem that can be narrowed down to a minimum with modern techniques for a system that comes along with huge impacts on a game, that everybody wants to be as original as possible?
---
That souns really fucked up to be honest. Imagine saving up for a main hand you really want and your GM forcing you to buy some shitty bracers because they have 3 more agi on them so that you can't buy the main hand after that. I would instantly quit such a no-fun-allowed guild. You can allocate gear OR make people pay for it, but you can't have fucking both man.
---
The second point is viable and should be implemented in any system I think. Thunderfury is a tank weapon no matter what rogues and fury warriors say (I'm a rogue main myself).
---
Just on alliance side
---
Battle for Dazar'alor
---
I have a feeling the stone form is going to be better. Rogues are a pain in the ass while leveling lol.
---
Have they added so everyone can see the Beta now just not everyone can click play?
---
That is so correct
---
Private servers are actually way harder than Classic beta. Go try to level a warrior on one and I can guarantee you that you’ll die in the starter zone.
---
I've said since the announcement that if 1.12 was the patch they chose, then values would have to be changed.  At this point it's best to just accept the only challenge will be late AQ40 and mid Naxx.
---
One of the easiest to level. Just boring.
---
Less boring than leveling paladin tho
---
Delete your reddit account.
---
Screenshot or it didn’t happen...
---
Well the only system without book keeping is the free roll system which has it's own problems as I mentioned.
---
Rage against the machine as well.
---
Shut up
---
Yes
---
pls no
---
Doesn't wotf only dispell one fear, so surely if you deathcoiled you could fear straight after once dispelled, and vice versa? I only ask this because I want to play a human warlock but I am seeing so many people laugh at people like me because it's apparently so stupid. 
---
I wan't to play one primarily for pvp.
---
So what he should have done is created another account and posted it here?
---
I don't see how that makes it more...organic.
---
Bullet for my valentine
---
Right my bad. But I feel like you are making assumptions that most people will have progressed through everything available by each phase. I know the game style will be different than during vanillia but the stats that we have show that almost 90% of players never made it through mc. Also what does that really have to do with people getting unstoppable force. It will still be a viable weapon in phase 3 and probably slightly above the bell curve of players
---
That’s literally what I’m sayin.
---
So many people are being mislead like people below, I get that some people are absolute angles and don't mid whipping on garr 7 times, but most will and people should be prepared to get removed from guilds if they cannot hold their own
---
Overall it is 61.5% DPS, 25.5% Heal, 13% Tank
---
I probably sound naive but what exactly is WoW 2.0? I would consider classic WoW the 2.0
---
I mean that's a nice theory because immersion was a huge part of classic WoW, but game balance wise this wasn't a good decision.
---
going at it together***
---
Any guild killed by loot council would've died anyway.
---
Yeah, lets see a pie with 8 slices with roughly the same size. That'll be easy to understand.
---
Very true, thats why i said you will have to read at least "some" part of the quest. But hoenstly ever since the release of arrows pointing the way, i skip reading even one line of quest text 99% of the time.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info!
---
I've heard alterac valley is same as BFA without reinforcements. Some people have said this is quite far from classic AV experience with all the quests and NPCs.
---
That’s just sad. If they don’t address this I won’t play it. I had my fix and realized it hits way to easy. 
---
No thanks, not worth my time. I unsubbed exactly for that reason.
---
My ysmirs beard! My bronzebearded Broski's arent afraid. After all we have fear ward &gt;:)
---
What are your thoughts on human warrior 10-20? I am under the impression dark shore is excellent due to high mob density. West fall is very crowded. I also think throwing in some Loch Modan 10-13 would be reasonable. Thoughts?
---
Give me an example of a loot system without these problems and I will gladly accept it and look for a guild that uses them or start one myself.
---
That would be impossible.. it would be like the unstoppable force meets the immovable object but what I meant is fight together*
---
Me and a friend are going 2 weeks of complete and utter no life rushing out mains to lvl60 and get those raid-ready.   
---
After that's done we're going to casual-it-up with the alts.
---
And that's why I wanna roll fury war and tryhard to be top DPS. So I can be prioritized for gear, especially weapons, hop into a better guild if mine is slowing down or we have bad apples that the GM won't remove. So I can be geared like a pig and go wreck people in PvP.
---
Loot council?
---
I played a warrior in Vanilla, plan on maining again for classic. Hoping it isn't going to be massively over populated for tanks otherwise gearing is gonna be hell.
---
Did you consider the fact that you’re more than ten years older and have known the game and how it works for just as long? You were probably just terrible at the game because you were learning it. No one wants easy classic but we want a stable game without game breaking bugs. If we wanted easy wow we would play retail
---
10 Rage to heal like 50-66% of the damage you'd have taken is a pretty good trade off. The difference is noticeable when you only have to bandage every 6-7 mobs as opposed to eating every 2 mobs or so.
---
&gt;Luckily Alliance got Perception, which is super easily avoidable and only useful when you already know that there is an invisible (stealthed) enemy nearby - how great! 
---
Just FYI, from a Horde Rogue point of view, perception is extremely strong. Good Human players can *really* fuck over a Horde Rogue
---
Yea doesn't sound fun
---
FML - my friend was still playing on a 3G stick in Cata, my house only got Fiber a year ago and its not even 10mbit fiber..
---
I guess Australian ISP’s are also a fan of #nochanges even when the government gives them money to directly fix the infrastructure.
---
maybe in classic bc
---
This! We're coordinating days off, groceries for ease of cooking and cleaning, classes to level together and professions to grind!
---
Don't even get into DnD, PoGo, and board games that we do together!
---
Very curious about your talents. I didn’t see a stun proc. Do you not use Blackout? Only 34 points in shadow tree - what have you “deselected”? I’m assuming affinity and fade, but what else?
---
70% of the time being average and 30% of the time utterly destroying everything xD - Such a fun build.

Got 2 different people that says they aren't able to see it
---
Dwarves are gassy though.
---
Hunter imo, Warlock is too gear dependent to fit your criteria. Mage and Rogue would be good alternatives.
---
Yea it's easier to add servers than have to merge later down the line. Blizzard stopped merging servers because once people start losing their names because another char on their merged server had it, people start quitting on mass.
---
Might be, then I have to play on private servers I guess. Because there’s no reason for me to play classic in that stage. 
---
Point is to ‘simulate’ vanilla as close as possible so ffs change the numbers blizzard I don’t care. Those are just numbers, the experiences are what we all looking for.
---
Why are you killing grey mobs?
---
PVP:
---
rogues, hunters, mages
---
PVE;
---
priests, warlocks, warriors
---
mage is a really strong allrounder in all pvp aspects. Be it 1vsX, BGs or blackrocl raid vs raid ( where classes like rogue fall of hard).
---
You will never beat a *competent* warlock, though. But realistically - who is?
---
but it is hard to make these kind of lists. Healers for example are not well suited for 1on1 by nature.
---
Everyone with an active sub can play up to level 15 for 48 hours, they announced it on Twitter. I'm surprised no one mentioned it here on Reddit honestly.
---
If you want the authentic^authentic vanilla experience at this point might as well build a time machine since you will never be pleased.
---
In vanilla you lost your world /DM buff when you entered a raid..
---
Is there any program in which I could limit my internet speed ? Wanna go all immersive.
---
Should it be considerate an exploit to use Blessing of Salvation in raids?

T1: Mage, Rogue, Hunter

(Except for Hunter, all classes are really powerful in T3/R14 gear but these 4 classes gain the biggest power spike)
---
Did they update their battle.net launcher?
---
How is it even possible republican / democrat ratio is so close to 50 / 50% overall in american history?
---
Should Dwarf Priests be considerate an exploit in raids? And should Dwarf Priests be removed inside raids?
---
And this is the reason why I don't even know if I would even try it.
---
I paid my dues back then levelling my current main, warrior, specced DPS till lvl 36 circa and then leveled the rest as a tank in Vanilla: I don't have the time to do that again :)
---
That’s how they spelled it
---
Well that's why I am asking, screenshots/videos to see if the database is true to what it was xD?
---
It's best to go herb skinning as you cannot track both herbs and ore. You could use gathererer, however.
---
Enchanting can be quite laborious, save your greens. Tailoring is fairly easy, again save your cloth.
---
You don’t know me, stop talking for me.
---
You can do more than free lot without keeping a ledger.
---
Easy. Any shaman DPS build. Ele, Enh, dont care. Shaman DPS is my favorite class I'll never be able to play in classic.
---
The most I saw people kicked was the people that wouldn't stop whining, even days after the raid, because they didn't get a piece of loot that dropped. Not whining because they weren't allowed to roll on their first raid with the guild, but because the roll didn't go their way.
---
Should flasks be considerate an exploit in raids? Black Lotus is like, super rare an annoying to get.
---
ITT Horde scum
---
No, it didn't happen to anybody else, that's why there has been 50 posts about it in the last 12 hours.
---
&gt;DKP...  new or less active members have no way of competing with the most active members and that even the most active members will do their damnest to cockblock each other from getting specific items.
---
Uh huh.
---
&gt;random rolling... doesn't reward being invested in the guild however, so why should an active player stay in a guild that doesn't reward his/her investment?
---
Yup.
---
&gt;Loot council? 
---
Yup, there's the solution.
---
&gt;Fuck. That.
---
Oh.
---
Loot council doesn't work as well in 40 mans as it does in retail. I wish it did but loot is so scarce that there is no way that it isn't going to start drama.
---
Returning player (bc-mop). Had a ret pally and feral Druid but as I understand it neither are that great in classic. Older now so won’t have time for raiding so will keep it more casual with some pvp&amp;bgs when I get to 60. So I’d prefer a class that performs well in pvp without having to be fully kitted out in raid gear, not too fussed on having a more challenging levelling process. Was thinking either mage or hunter at the moment but open to any suggestions. Thanks in advance!
---
I'd argue that Horde has a faster way to get to gnomer than alliance.
---
Just take the boat to Booty Bay and teleport directly into Gnomer. Much easier than flying to IF and then running allllllll the way to Gnomer.
---
Doesn't Comedy Central always play a rerun episode or two before the new one? I think I'd rather them just replay the old one. We're going back to it, not something new, so why not have SP do the same thing.
---
Could be fun to have a survey right before release, and one every 4 or 6 months, to see how people end up picking, and what classes end up sticking around the most
---
One thing is what people think they will, another is what they end up doing
---
&gt;Less talking and more listening from you bud.
---
Haha. Less getting carried and more actual contribution from you, buddy boi.
---
Again, if you enjoy not actually doing much, and you can find some sugardaddies to do all the things for you, be my guest.
---
Should warrior be banned from raids? They do like a gazillion damage in patch 1.12.1. Should Warriors be transformed in to ret palas, without blessing of salvation ofc, in raids?
---
because class / race fantasy. 
---
Only one wanna play priest is shadow undead priests. Or a hex troll idk. But alliance is filled with human priests. Or nelf elune priests.  just fits better
---
very slight upgrade? its bis till you have full t2
---
Oh, OK xD
---
Truefaith
---
My mate us going rogue he can do the damage for the 70%
---
Someone who almost never shows up to raid and new people shouldn't really expect gear. Plus people who have been to every raid get to save up for the best pieces or two in the instance while those new or more casual players pick up the tier gear on the cheap. Your system seems alright but I think the players who show up every week should get first choice in loot not just a better chance.
---
Yeah it is an okay system, but when you start using formulas and implementing the same functions as in our financial systems for a made up reward system then you know that things have gotten out of hand. It's too complicated. And nobody likes inflation as is, so why should people like it in game? Sure it makes SENSE. But it's also complicated, intransparent and really punishing to people who go on a two week vacation for example. Losing stuff that you already earned is just not fun.
---
:)  
---
Yes there is lot of them in Vanilla, for example most of rare in dungeon are elites.  
---
You can find the list here: [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Rare\_mobs\_by\_zone](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Rare_mobs_by_zone)  
---
Scroll to the bottom, you will find the list of classic rares. If their name is marked with " † " it means they are elite rare.
---
Should voice chat be considerate an exploit or not? Not everyone want to use that and just want to relax and have fun alone. Should it be removed in raids?
---
Hunter sounds like a good choice! Easy to level, more solo content available, good in PvP even if gear is lacking.
---
I guess they should ‘simulate’ terrible internet connections, limit fps to max 35,  and lower the aspect ratio and resolution to what was common back in 05 as well then
---
I do know you, on the way to your super classic elitist toxic nerdfest help yourself and grab a hooker. Also, post a sources before making the statement that the numbers aren't the same.

"Is it stupid to lvl as prot warrior? I plan on running all the dungeons." - literally everyday
---
I also remember playing alot of In Flames
---
Then stfu and stop talking for us 🙄
---
I will reserve judgement until I try the stress test beta. I leveled about a dozen or more Forsaken in the starting are and I will know pretty quick at some key parts if it's overly easy.
---
They'd have to make the episode about streamers
---
thats why warriors are warrior. Instead of sprinting to run away, or kiting, you are given only one option and that is to fight. Anything else is death.
---
I remember buying thousands upon thousands of gold in Vanilla to pay for boost runs. Mainly BF pieces from BWL and CTB
---
Good Times albeit expensive times!
---
I hope Blizz will release official numbers like the private servers did.
---
What’s the YouTube channel for this guy? Not sure if it’s the caulton one or OPs name from post. Want to see more of these videos past level 10
---
You literally don’t know me bc the picture in which you’re trying to paint me in is literally the exact opposite of myself. Smfh community consists of a group of sad incels.
---
Ah I dont have kids and a wife that works over nights sooooo I get to play in silence when I get off work and on my days off.
---
&gt;This is bordering on conspiracy.
---
I'm not saying THIS bug won't get fixed. Saying that, I agree, would border on conspiracy.
---
&gt;They haven't fixed it yet because it's difficult.
---
And I think there are a lot of difficult things to fix that they aren't keeping us in the loop about. Maybe they shouldn't, but the fact the the melee ranges haven't even been discussed by Blizzard imo is a bad thing.
---
&gt;I'd suggest gathering a couple of priests in-game and testing the bug, instead of sharing non-sense on reddit.
---
I didn't share this, and I've been spending my time testing mage bugs.
---
What a lame answer
---
How do you manage the dreaded 40-50 for alliance? I've heard that some top speedrunners grind for a few levels.
---
Situational
---
Making sure you pick pocket as much as you can at lvl 60 doing instances etc will give you a free epic mount after a few months.
---
"It's something"
---
Yeah, both of them.
---
Yeah but this is D&amp;D, every edition has upsides and downsides. 4th had by far the best tactical combat and monster design of any version of D&amp;D, whether that was worth the tradeoff in homogenisation and reduced versimilitude is up for each person to decide. It's not worse, just different.
---
That'll show them!  Let's play Ret...omg imagine their faces!
---
Too confusing
---
Another solid track for PvP. Voodoo People by The Prodigy and remixes by Pendulum.
---
Have they patched the servers since it surfaced?
---
Anyone that uses exploit with world buffs is a dunce and should be ignored.
---
*ofc*
---
-Payo
---
Hence the title of this whole thread
---
Hey be nice to Lokth he's has had some good points and is super sexy.
---
There’s no way a rogue is gonna be my 1st or 2nd 60, but I love having one to casually level up. I’ll get them some good gear, a nice engineering head start, and just seek out World PvP, and kill mobs in between. Same with warrior, if I want to tank dungeons.
---
What do you consider a world buff? Pretty sure people were turning in dragon heads before a raid for the buff and it stuck in the instance ...
---
One thing bad with Classic: Protection paladins can't tank due to lack of taunt, overall itemization lacking and mana issues despite having a talent tree dedicated to the role of tanking.
---
Only if you're playing in a world that revolves around the players. If you're aiming for a more sandbox feel in which the world lives and breathes and the players just happen to be part of it doing that destroys immersion.

pvp orc, pve troll.

congratulations, you're willingly becoming a failure of a human
---
How? A good Rogue wouldn't give an enemy a headsup that he's coming, the improved Stealth from Vanish counters Perceptions increased Stealth detection and you can easily create and keep enough distance to stay out of the detection radius for it's duration. The detection radius isn't even big if the Rogue specs improved Stealth.
---
That said it may be stronger now that internet connections are better. I just read in a thread that the detection radius is about 20 yards if they have improved stealth which is not AT ALL how it factually worked back then, which may have been caused by server lag or tick rates giving them extra time to close in on you before they're revealed.
---
Notice that your client doesn't know a Rogue is there until you discover him (to prevent cheating by intercepting the "rogue is here" data package) which makes it even more prone to lag problems.
---
Once again I'll have to wait and see how it plays on modern systems with modern internet etc, but back then Perception was pretty damn useless and it's not about good or bad players. The effective discovery radius was like 10 yards and that's if you knew where to look, which a good Rogue will avoid.
---
I hope you're right and it's actually useful this time around but I doubt it. Again, after all you need to know that one is there in the first place and that's already a sign of a terrible Rogue (outside Duels maybe. But even then any Rogue with a Brain would just wait out the racial somewhere at the corner of the dueling area. It's not like Rogues aren't aware of that racial.
---
I think it's a non-issue that people are blowing up because they are bored and the summer is long.
---
&gt;People still think back porting from Legion was a good decision lmao?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Why they didn't make OG 1.12 compatible with their modern systems is beyond me.
---
&gt;On top of the cancer that is sharding/layering, you're seeing all these bugs and incosistencies such as this bug, melee leeway, hunter dead zone, incorrect spell animations, incorrect AV lighting.
---
&gt;But hey let's keep chanting "It'S JuSt bEtA" folks!
---
&gt;  People like to have an end goal when playing a game. If that's your argument, then why would they play Classic at all? They could just play retail and enjoy a decent leveling experience (that scales even) with the ability to actually do endgame content at their own pace. 
---
Not everyone takes video gaming this seriously. WoW Classic was the most causal MMO ever released at the time which is what made it so popular. To a lot of people, playing a video game is just about having fun not about being the best at it. Sure people who raid and hardcore pvp will have better gear, but you can still 5-man or casually pvp fine without top gear, or even start an alt and level up again.
---
Kek, based bro. Truly a hardcore gamer and redpilled. &gt;!nice trolling though!&lt;
---
THIS. IS. MY. CURSE
---
He was also full endgame gear with 12k hp to compenstate, with fully endgame geared healers, and running a full TPS set, not a mitigation set. It's not a comparable situation to the above.
---
That being said I was exaggerating a little bit (hence "almost double"), ideal mitigation set for a bear is between 17k and 20k. Some bear druids did have sets reaching into 22k but as this is dangerously close to the armor cap (perhaps slightly above, idr the exact mark), those sets were run mostly for fights with armor shred mechanics. 
---
11k is flat out too little to tank Hakkar, especially if your healers aren't in Naxx gear.
---
Live to Win on loop is the only best answer.
---
Lack of challenging raids for hardcore players. Naxxramas is nothing compared to mythic raiding. 
---
The BG matchup system is pretty wonky in vanilla. Since all that matters is honor, you want to get into a premade and dodge other premades while stomping pugs. So the PvP ranking system rewards time spent more than skill.
---
You don't need to be prot to tank, but I would strongly advise rushing tactical mastery if you're going to be tanking a lot. Being able to charge in and retain the rage is invaluable.
---
In fairness by patch 1.12 and even before WoW launched I had cable internet and a great gaming machine. I never played private servers so I will be pretty easy for me to tell. I am siding with Blizzard on this one until I see for myself.
---
Seems a forgot a word: significant* upgrade. If it’s clear you are foregoing significant upgrades for a specific item, you could be harming the group more by doing so than taking the dkp hit and not getting the specific item you want.
---
You are also calling dkp bad, but saying a preventative measure against dkp hoarding is “no fun allowed”. DKP hoarding is a variation of “no fun allowed”.
---
Problem is that doesn't translate well to raiding as we saw in classic. How it actually ended up was hybrid classes heal since no other classes can do that and it's not worth bringing them if they're any other spec. That isn't fun if you want to boomkin.
---
&gt;The authentic vanilla experience includes hard hitting mobs and demanding low level dungeons. 
---
&gt;In 3 days of playing with a warrior, I did not die ONCE. 
---
&gt;Not ONCE. that’s ridiculous. &amp; I always pushed for the limit, I basically almost wanted to be killed. 
---
Almost as if you are a better player than 15 years ago.
---
Seriously all this nitpicking shit is dumb... can't wait for release so I can stop reading these nonsense posts.
---
&gt;People will realize eventually that the game is too easy &amp; it will die out faster as you think, because what truly hold us on Classic is that dangerous adventure that rewards time &amp; effort.
---
The systems are what makes classic the best version of wow.
---
Nobody is looking for mythic plus - bfa exists.
---
The fact that it's easy is blizzards goal - more accessible = potential for more customers that aren't giving them $15 right now.
---
Well said. Pretty good ROI if you ask me.
---
I can say that for me personally this is definitely true. I used to play a hunter back in the old vanilla days, and now that classic is coming back I want to pick it up again. I've always been a casual player and don't plan on changing now.
---
Apparently you have not watched Eviscerate by Akrios.
---
The only songs you need are obviously: Metallica - All Nightmare long and Master of Puppets
---
Sounds like a good way to piss off your no-lifers unless they know the system and agree with it. Imagine being No-Life Larry, spending more time and effort than the majority of his guildies and he wants a specific item (let's say a good weapon with a 5% drop chance.) He has cleared the raid 6 or 7 times and has gone through the progression phases (when wipes were more common) hoping for his drop and it's the only item he needs. Average Andy joined the guild later when the raid was easier, and also wants the weapon. Larry gets unlucky and rolls a 1 and Andy rolls enough to win it. Larry now has to wait for many more clears in hopes that the weapon will drop again. Larry gets pissed and leaves the guild. 
---
Your system is basically DKP with a "random bullshit" clause that can swipe items from dedicated guild members. Good DKP systems have decay to encourage raid participation and discourage hoarding. You want to reward your consistent performers, otherwise your guild will hemorrhage players. All it takes is one bad roll.
---
HE'S FLYING TOO FAST AND HE'S FLYING TOO HIGH
---
Can we get the private servers names that got us here? I think that would be a true tip of the hat to the communities that played and helped show blizzard this is something we wanted. And have their names immortalized especially Nost.
---
So many priests? Didnt expect that

It’s times like this being alone and lonely really pays off!
---
Shaman will be super popular this time
---
What if he doesn't want to? It sucks getting reduced to a healbot when you wanted to feel like a righteous dude smacking stuff with a hammer or a noble defender protecting others behind his shield.
---
Not the point. MC is fucking horribly boring and healable in quest greens, yet people will still work toward better gear to clear it faster and more efficiently. They are expected by others and expect it of themselves.
---
I’m like I said the exact opposite of a “hardcore gamer”. Do we have to talk on Instagram so you guys can look into a mirror and realize what big of an incel you are or what? Smfh Gaming community became beyond autistic over the years. 
---
Knew there’s a reason why I stopped playing video games at all.
---
Yup... stress test available to NA with active sub - starts today at 2pm pdt, is 48 hours and level cap is 15.
---
48 hours though my friend
---
Not on console, where most of the playerbase is.
---
What? Enhance is ridiculously bad in PvP. You get the proc? You propably win. You dont? You certainly lose.
---
Hmm that's a fair point.
---
Because merging layers is a lot less noticeable than merging servers completely.
---
If he doesn't want to heal he shouldn't choose a hybrid. It's common sense. If he wants to tank, the choice is clear.
---
Although I’m sure SP doing an episode on “Twatch” would bring a lot of attention to the platform.  I can already picture the Cartman ASMR.
---
No. They are targeting specific zones and levels - if they want 60 to be tested they will increase the cap - I don't see why they would need to test 60 content though.
---
bis by a small amount. its such a small difference and its so expensive that very few people actually bother getting it. not worth it. even the most hardcore priests dont get it. very simple concept.
---
&gt;Rolling for items isn't an effective way to get items to the players that they need to go to
---
What does that even mean? Everyone has a reason for "needing" an item. If two rogues need a sword how can you assume to know who "needs" it more?
---
Loot council works as well as communism. Perfect in theory, but the worst fucking idea in reality. Because let's make item allocation based on the "unbiased" opinion of greedy nerds within a fictional hirarchy. 
---
At least from my experience butts get hurt super hard with loot council. People leave and then other people leave and then the guild is dead.
---
Fuck that. If you're going to duel me then you're dueling me, not generic Hunter template. Blizzard taking away bits and pieces of classes and characters in arenas and bgs is why I stopped doing them.

I did a ton of research when looking for a new gaming chair and wound up getting an office chair made by Herman Miller. Armrest cushions are a really good idea
---
Are you comparing to paladins or another class
---
With a staff an argument  *could* be made to use windfury.  
---
However 99% of elemental gear is gonna be 1H+Offhand or Shield.  In that case when you have enough spell power your best bets are frostbrand or flametongue weapon enchants since they scale with spellpower.
---
Personally it depends on what you're doing and what BG/PVP activity you're doing.
---
I cried sometimes when running to my corpse in Redridge for the 114th time.
---
All of this is irrelevant unless they make new servers with any post naxx content. 
---
Then anyone that wants to play NON classic - can transfer their classic character to the NON classic servers.
---
You’re right probably actually 2006, quit before bc
---
No you didn’t. There’s plenty of videos of people raiding with world/DM buffs.
---
" We’re basically getting the Vanilla easy mode, because that’s what the devs literally aimed for. 1.12 was a transition patch - and that’s a fact. "
---
I assume you have a source for this "Fact"?
---
I should have been clearer. When I said level cap, I meant the cap that they have currently put on the beta. So the boost would only go to level 40 now, and then get higher if/when they raise the level cap more.
---
TBC or Wotlk allowed two spec trees to be saved
---
Watch the sentiment change drastically 6 months from now.
---
You have no clue how the server infrastructure works so just stop. It would be a lot cheaper to just have completely separate servers without any kind of layering or load balancing between them.
---
I'd say Succ if you're horde WL (wotf breaks it) - you have the biggest problems against melees, so succ is very helpful imo. 
---
As ally I'd take felhunter because of wotf
---
This is one of the top PVP songs ever, and it's probably going to make a come back.
---
Give it time. People get ganked enough times in STV they go back and start a rogue.
---
That too, but alas, the ghost world grew on you and became your faithful companion.
---
Both me and my friend at the time had significant amounts of fun farming and making gold on the AH. That was a core part of the game for us.
---
Ahhhhhh gotcha - my bad jumping the gun - that would make sense for them to do 100% - testers should have the choice for sure.
---
But that isn't common sense. Nearly half the classes in the game having no choice but to heal when raiding is probably the biggest flaw vanilla had. It feels bad and isn't fun.
---
They probably want to test the entire gamut of the leveling experience, so probably not.
---
No it's just people on reddit who get way too much influenced by what they read.
---
The point is that do we really want blizz to tune up the numbers so that they’re no longer accurate? My point was, which I guess is hard to understand, is where do we really want it to end if we want blizz to ‘simulate’ the classic experience instead of delivering accurate numbers?
---
And there we go, worth every dollar. Keep on watching sir.
---
They will be extremely popular
---
What pepper jack said is very true. It would be a lot easier to watch a video showing the new raids and some of the mechanics instead of trying to explain it. But i will give it a shot. I'll just do one example of a boss from the battle for dazar' alor raid.
---
Mekkatorque: 
---
One of the most fun bosses in BFDA in my opinion. There are many raid mechanics in it that are differnt from anything in the past. The best example would be when the Spark bots come out. They need to be slowed so they don't get near the raid and Aoe them down. After a few seconds the boss shrinks 3 members of the raid, and they have to run to the sparkbots and hop inside them. They also have to dodge all the other players because they can be stepped on if people move on top of them. Once inside the sparkbots, the three players will get a new action bar with a few different colors and symbols. (red spanner, purple chicken, green spring, yellow nail, blue cog) and the only way they can get out of the sparkbot is if they press the right sequence of buttons. The catch is they have no idea what the correct sequence is. The sequence is flashed above the bots head, but only the people in the other 2 spark bots can see the sequence. so you have to communicate with the other bots and have them give you your sequence and you have to give them theirs. Which sounds easy on paper but in the middle of a raid with the raid leader calling shit out it gets pretty hectic. And if you enter the wrong code you are hit with a huge dot that very well can wipe your raid
---
On top of that there are random members of the raid that will be hit with a debuff that requires you to line of sight the rest of the raid. After a few seconds you will explode and if you were not in line of sight you will wipe the raid. And while all of this is going on you still need to dodge a frontal cone attack from the boss, as well as the boss jumping in the air and stomping down. He deploys explosive sheep through the battlefield that you have to dodge as well. Meanwhile he starts shrinking more and more of the raid. So you have to dodge but make sure you are not stepping on any raid member. 
---
And this is all part of one boss in Battle for Dazar' alor. And many of the other bosses have other crazy mechanics as well.
---
The ganking lvl 30s as a 60 character kind of Pvp. the only one I practice.
---
never said ppl would have progressed through most, just stated most would be at lvl 60. Also its a different age, u should look at pservs where after a month most are 60 and after 2 months 90-95% at at lvl 60 if not already pre-raid geared.
---
World buffs are not necessary in raids at all. They are there for the people / guilds who wish to push towards that extra hurdle in progression or speed run to test themselves. 
---
I won't be setting them as a requirement, more as a "Oh hey Ony head isn't up and we can get an extra buff for the raid, neat" - kind of situation.
---
I’ve Mained hunter since wotlk, but now I’m really addicted to rogue, outlaw specifically. I wanna pvp a lot more than I pve, and try to climb ranks. Is vanilla rogue as much fun as current rogue is, For me at least ?
---
In 2005, when leveling my first character, I didn't die on my Paladin until I was Level 36.
---
When I leveled a Warrior alt, I didn't really have problems until **after** level 40 when I started questing in the Hinterlands/Tanaris/Azshara, but even then I didn't die a bunch, I just needed to bandage/eat between mobs.
---
I hope so
---
All nightmare long was definitely on my list, but not during vanilla. I don't think it was out yet.
---
Well, thats how it was. I think its ok to have some sort of advantage in raids if you do the homework. However, the way it works probably isnt very healthy for gameplay, since it forces you to log off and also makes raids quite easy. Removing this option would make you not worry about buffs and you could actually play on your main, whenever you want and also makes the raids somehow more challenging. It should be removed or nerfed to some degree
---
Like dude, just make CS work like judgement , depending on seals, that's it. It would literally take 5 minutes, and you have a viable spec.
---
A scenario that will happen many time :
---
\- a UD rogue starts his stunlock routine on you
---
\- when the stuns are finished you're at 30% life (if your gear sucks you'll die before you can do anything)
---
\- deatchcoil is not up
---
\- he's stabbing you while running all around you so you can't cast anything
---
What do you do ?
---
You'd better be an engineer with a lot of grenades and have a stock of live action potions !
---
My sub went down and a few days ago and it's letting me in.
---
Du, Du Hast
---
Go back to dial up lol
---
Retail level squish to 60, a new 60-70 xpac is created and both classic and retail join to become the new live.
---
No flying mounts in vanilla so open top is fine. If the horde want to attack they come through the front gate or via deeprun tram which means attacking IF first anyway.
---
I can work between alt tabs
---
Protection paladins are able to take use of the reckoning talent choice for pvp and also being a more defensive type of healer / hybrid. Not applied to raid. Prot paladin has its merits outside in the world. Although not a good choice in raids. A decent choice in dungeons being able to utilize more than a warrior can outside of the tank role if no other paladin is in the group. 
---
Itemization is bad for a prot paladin yes. But there is no strict talent specialization in classic. The itemization is there for the role of a hybrid and yes, plate gear is lacking for mana and healing properties but that is the tradeoff for armor.
---
(yes there is a looooot of bad design choices for it all but I think still there is some percentage of pros to their design)
---
Death Knights were also kinda of like a melee version of a Warlock. So if you are okay with casting, go Lock.
---
&gt; Your argument would be the same against playing priest as well on the Alliance side.
---
Only a dwarf priest, not everyone like to play dwarf.
---
Just to offer a different perspective: I think you will find that you would get a lot of the same benefits just by playing a hunter, albeit with very similar downsides to those you would have had if you had chosen to play a character whose class was hunter.
---
The gear-dependency of Warriors is a lot higher than that of other classes.
---
If your gear is near the best of your level you will do fine against others for whom this also is the case.
---
If both have bad gear, then the Warrior suffers a lot more relatively spoken. Especially against casters, who's casts have high base-damage.
---
Came here to say THIS. You can get almost 20g per hour just farming random mobs and vendoring the greys. I'd like to see this tested in BRD tho.
---
Damn, my lotr crossover meme got removed by mods
---
I think he was joking
---
Definitely do not want Blizzard adding any new content to classic, as they would probably just fuck it up like they did with the current game.
---
An extra 6mp5 isn't going to help anyone clear raids faster or more efficiently.
---
Though I'd like to hear your argument for kicking healers out of raids once they reach farm status.
---
I'm not even sure if you can.  They could be retailers that don't realize Paladin/Shaman are faction-locked.
---
You should look into adding chapter markers to your podcast. 
---
Forecast is the best application I know of to do this.

Never sold the account
---
Yeah, but what if you are the average Andy? Going into a raid knowing full well that you can't get any good shit is not a really good motivation. Just adding a slight chance of winning increases the motivation to play by a MILE. Just look at all the people playing the fucking lotery. They basically can't win, but "there is a chance" so they keep playing.
---
Luck is also a factor in real life. Not everything is based on skill and dedication. Sometimes you win and sometimes you get fucked entirely based on luck. So it's not something totally unheard of. 
---
Also as I said I don't think that a guy that has done 2 more raids out of 10 should get the item 100%, because it devalues the 8 times the other guy was in the raid. Effectively the 2 raid participations become more valuable than the 8 raid participations and that is bullshit.
---
Make a bank alt or two to store any boe greens you dont sell to de later for mats and store all the cloth you gather as you level so you can power level both of them.
---
Can't forget Trivium either
---
And its not guaranteed at all, i haven't gotten in for the last and todays stress test. I've had this account since early wotlk, bought all expansions, been subbed years at a time. For what its worth.
---
This is the first world equivelant of having kids to work your farm
---
People aren't going to need consumables to raid but some of them are going to need their consumables to get around blizzard. I'm not here to start the tankadin argument but consumables will eliminate their mana drawback. A boomkin with consumables is not an oomkin. If you're going to take the harder path, you may want to do what you can to stay level with better designed specs. I'm just talking consumables though, world buffs can be a lot of hoops to jump through if you take them too seriously.
---
I had to close the app and reopen it.
---
I saw 1-25 when I installed yesterday.
---
I think that's the intention too, but it does look like it's in Outland, looking into Azeroth.
---
TBC was and still is WoW 2.0
---
Man i'm still torned about this choice. Was going rogue or hunt, but druid able to fill everything is so cool.
---
Yay another don't play the game how you want to post, you literally doing what bugs you, telling people to play your way or they doing it wrong
---
Is there one for feral and resto as well?
---
But wouldn't a boost get more people involved in testing the game?
---
That's simply not true, though. Enhancement shaman and ret paladins absolutely raided in vanilla. No class is pidgeon holed into a particular spec or role in vanilla, despite what these sub will tell you.
---
Because playing WoW makes you a man child 🙄
---
I'd love to see new gear added that makes the offspecs of certain classes more viable.
---
Classic should feel like Vanilla. If we now are forced to have 16 debuffs, 1.12.1 talents and upgraded gear in phase 1 as a necessary evil it makes perfect sense to adjust the damage so that the game is not easier than it was in Vanilla.
---
Well the spec thing matters sorry. Very few guilds want a feral druid in a raid. So if someone doesn't want to heal or maybe tank druid is not what they should pick.
---
Servey McServer Face
---
This is before they play and have to respec dps to do everything else than raid and dungeon. Enjoy the cost sink
---
But they’re still aired by Comedy Central and need to match their schedule
---
Hey man! I played druid in TBC and did mess about with moonkin spec. I remember for a little while the moonkin was super powerful and often out DPS'd mages (which was my other main). But I don't have any experience with them in vanilla. Obviously I know that the general statement is they have mana issues, but how are moonkins in vanilla generally in your opinion?
---
Poke, poke, poke is that all you can ?
---
How do you feel about human mage for pvp? I want to be an ally mage but fuck gnomes
---
I agree 100%. I Love tanking in vanilla. Its boring AF in all expansions after TBC pretty much.
---
Everything is included in the spreadsheet.  
---
The Feral (Tank &amp; Dps) and Heal BIS values comes from the original [*Taladril's spreasheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#) !
---
The Valthalak fight at the end, loved it!
---
Soulforge and Feralheart sets, both complete (didn't matter I had Judgement and Stormrage already) fun times with friends completing that chain.
---
There is plenty of content for hardcore players.
---
Hardcore player is something you have to define more for me to giva a good reply but if you are talking about
---
"hardcore raiders" as in "method like guilds in retail"
---
Then yes. There are a lack of mechanics in bosses in classic compared to retail. 
---
Retail is more "bullet helly" / fast paced and mechanicly more difficult in the terms of what the boss does outside of numbers.
---
Also. classic wow lacks the appeal to aiming for hardcore fps players in cs:go
---
hardcore sc appeal of not having to utilize as much apm.
---
What I am saying is, its not a game designed as heavily on raiding as retail is (almost like a different genre in a way)
---
I bought a Secret Labs Titan chair...its legit the most comfortable thing I've ever sat in.  It also reclines as much as a Lazy Boy...which is unnecessary but awesome.
---
&gt;Everyone has a reason for "needing" an item. If two rogues need a sword how can you assume to know who "needs" it more?
---
You allocate the sword to the player in a way that has the greatest positive impact on the raid. So, someone who attends the most raids, would perform the most DPS with it, uses it to help guildies outside of raids, etc. That way your guild will become stronger and more efficient at clearing content and in turn produce a greater amount of loot for everyone else. When someone else achieves an upgrade, it should be as if you're getting an upgrade as well.
---
&gt;Loot council works as well as communism. Perfect in theory, but the worst fucking idea in reality.
---
Well, communism has never been the problem. The problem has been authoritarianism. Luckily, video games aren't aren't as complicated, and you choose your guilds but you can't choose your nation.
---
&gt;Because let's make item allocation based on the "unbiased" opinion of greedy nerds within a fictional hirarchy.
---
It works great when you don't raid with greedy nerds.
---
&gt;At least from my experience butts get hurt super hard with loot council. People leave and then other people leave and then the guild is dead.
---
I've been in several successful loot council guilds. The people who had their butts hurt were the greedy people who felt it was unfair that their low effort wasn't being rewarded with a constant stream of loot. In that sense, loot council has another benefit: it filters out the terrible people who you probably don't want to play with anyways.
---
Sometimes people like to level everything together as they level getting enjoyment out of all aspects of the games while doing so. I personally am not a fan of this “just get to 60 and then you can do everything else” mentality. On the beta I would level a couple of levels, see that my alchemy has been slacking so take the time to go farm herbs to bring it up. Notice cooking was really low, spend some time fishing, then go back to leveling. This is nice in a completionists mind especially when the herbs or fish in the area you are leveling in work for the farming you want to do.
---
Being severely suboptimal at all but one thing is being pigeon holed into doing that one thing.
---
Don't make me laugh
---
I'd skip Imp Heroic Strike at the beginning and go 5/5 Parry.  
---
More Parry gives you more mitigation, more DPS (Parry haste attacks) and therefore more rage.  
---
The rest of /u/Malohn's path I generally agree with.
---
I made this to be used with the addon.  
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warrior&amp;talents=yKyLyMyNyOqlryrzrArBqmqorMrNrOrPqrsgqnrQrRs3sPqtr3r4qvsasbr5r6rSrTqprUrVr-yYyZy0y1y2Io
---
I've left Imp. Heroic Strike out completely, but I'd recommend putting it in whenever you start feeling like you have enough rage to justify using HS a lot.
---
I agree, pushed to the extreme any system is "no fun allowed" in my opinion. Because you have either other people dictating which items you get or not, you have pure chance that can fuck you over and you have a DKP hoarding system that blocks most people off.
---
And the system I propose is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. I just wanted to combine chance with progressive rewards, because I always believed rolling for things to be fun and exciting, but also think that more dedicated players should have a higher chance to acquire stuff.
---
Lol
---
I’m not gonna look up &amp; compare each patch note for you guys, if you could also just accept obvious facts since that’s basically common knowledge.
---
I went through this process last week.
---
I stopped playing WoW in 2009 and in Jan 2011 I got an email from Blizzard letting me know that my account was banned for economy abuse.  I emailed them back stating that I hadn't played the game since 2009 and they contacted me letting me know there was strong evidence that my account had been compromised.
---
I went through the process of securing my account, but never bothered getting it *'un-banned'* because I didn't really see myself coming back to the game.  But with the launch of Classic on the horizon I decided to get my account back.
---
Make sure that you have a good quality scan of some form of official ID and that all the details on it (name etc.) match those on your account.  The whole process took just over 24 hours.
---
No wife, no kids,  no problem.
---
Succubus cc him assuming this isn't world pvp as most people will have a voidwalker out. But you've chosen warlocks hardest counter class to vs assuming they open first, and rogues usually win most fights they stunlock through except maybe druids.
---
This next test is for all players with an active sub.
---
So people just want TBC back? I mean it was def awesome but classic comes out slightly on top for me.
---
The fun is creating a world that is a living, breathing creature outside of the players, while still tuning things behind the scenes so that each player has opportunities for their characters to be useful.
---
I!!!! STAND ALONE!!!!!!!! INSIDE, I!!!! STAND ALONEEEEEE!
---
So i wasnt the only one who only listened to linkin park while playing
---
Imagine 72 man raids in 2000.
---
Amon Amarth got me through Northrend back in the day
---
Beta is the actual classic beta, wow classic is a 48 hour stress test that starts in around 6-8 hours
---
I never managed to beat the Silithus-quest-mob back then. :(
---
Soni is a rank one beating up on randoms. He also has every advantage possible with on use and engineering items. You could also watch old swifty vanilla pvp videos where he does well. However those are selected clips. The average warrior will struggle much more in many 1v1 situations.
---
I wouldn't fight with any version of myself past the age of 14. We'd both just do our own thing quietly, being depressed and shit.
---
CoB is a requirement for vanilla
---
When I knew close to nothing about WoW and made my first character back in the WotLK days I made an Undead Warlock, only to find out that the friend who finally convinced me to play already was an Undead Warlock.
---
Strongly disagree on that front if you're aiming for it to feel real. Create the world so it behaves like proper world should, each player will need to make their own opportunities to be useful.
---
Mine too hehe. She's going mage, free water and food for leveling. Always having a second person with me for wpvp, just goofing off fishing etc, it's so fun having a second player all the time :D
---
Don't get me wrong, I genuinely like 4e for what it is, but it's not wrong to say that a significant portion of the fanbase didn't like it.
---
Shittier graphics with less demands tho.  I didn’t have a problem with the EQ raids, but couldn’t handle the WoW ones lol.
---
Can u explain this to my gf? Im 26 and super excited for classic but she thinks gaming is stupid and childish and for teens not adults :(
---
Most of the things you mentioned wouldn't work anymore on most servers because of low population and faction imbalances.  Blizzard's cross server tech does not help build communities and leaves much to be desired.
---
So? We're all different
---
When it comes to shadow Undead are the absolute best because of devouring plague. Most of the other class/race stuff is really up to preference, but with spriests there is only Undead. DP is extremely strong.
---
Dont change ANYTHING
---
You make me laugh dude, dont go thrwoing around "facts" when you cant back them up. You are just making noise then my friend. You should probably do some research on the "facts" before you come ranting to reddit. Perhaps Classis is just better off without you in it.
---
rewarding time spent is as important as skill in my opinion.
---
You should reward both.
---
If we are purely talking about bg premade dodging here then:
---
I do think the premade that is farming honor this way is having a lot of fun stomping noobs tbh. There is something enjoyable by wrecking a few bg matches. (I am only taking 1 positive note out of this and does not indicate that the whole thing is a net positive)
---
Why doesn't it take mp5 into account? It's your most important stat. Without it you'll be oom after 30 seconds and forced to punch the boss.
---
That's not necessarily a bad thing. There can always be scenarios where players get a chance to shine on their own. You can give characters their own arcs and opportunities to be the star.
---
&gt; I won’t play it 
---
I’m sure they will shut the whole project down when they hear the news
---
I prefer alliance citys. The races on ally look better. I do pay attention to lore and be immersed into my toon. cant help but look at undead as emotionless cannible sickos. Trolls used to eachother to. Orcs are bloodthirsty evil warmongers. Id rather go alliance.
---
I suggest you search for « Hector is eulogy » or « Hector the unforgiven », he was and still is so amazing. His videos will give you a great overview about what you _can_ do with a rogue.
---
I only like the war target idea
---
Other awesome pvp vid from Pat
---
Nice ad homenim.
---
No one cares about your feelings. You are never forced to participate in low level PvP if you think twinking is both cheating and ruins the game for others.
---
No one claimed to be the center of the universe when making twink, aside being an absolutely outrageous claim. They enjoy perfecting gear with a very specific set of restrictions. There is nothing exclusive about making a twink, it's actually very approachable and significantly less expensive than gearing out or leveling to 60.
---
Let me make it very clear to everyone reading this. Twink don't ruin the game. They ruin it for *you*. You don't like twinks, and by next extension anyone who does.
---
Let me remind you people are allowed to have fun in any way they seem fit in classic. If you want to make purple shirts all day, go for it. If you want yo spend all day fishing all day on your level 38 main. Go for it! If you love raidng, have at it. Some people even spend 24/7 camping spots like black rock mountain, un'goro or low level towns ganking. Perfectly acceptable.
---
Twinking is no exception and is a valid way to play the game. There are no participation trophies in vanilla/classic. Learn to deal with adversity.
---
Again, kindly get bent.
---
When it seems like everyone is being an asshole to you, do you think everyone's an asshole, or do you think it's the common denominator?
---
Pre-raid BIS lists should be worked toward though. I mean, don't worry about the best gear you can get in the current phase but trying for the best quest reward or 5-man piece you can take into MC is okay.
---
I would expect that in the interest of actually testing some of the end game dungeons and raids they'll be doing level boosts with pre geared characters.
---
I have a DnD friend that spells it Rouge every time and I always try to correct him but it's yet to stick after 2 years.
---
I hope they stocked up on Fabreeze
---
BFA - I can play a 1-3 hrs everyday
---
Classic - I only get one day a month
---
On private server it was the case. Not during Vanilla. Look at Nihilum WF on KT they had ZG buff.
---
I took a closer look after I've seen your post: 
---
86% of them will play healer! I would have thought that at least 50% will play as shadow because of the "melting faces" threads\^\^
---
I was going go roll night elf hunter for nostalgia but this has me second guessing myself about finally playing horde.
---
Hell I am surprised Bodies by Drowning Pool hasn't been mentioned
---
I just bought a recliner last night and padded arms was one of my criteria for it.
---
You're EU, you won't be able to click it till who knows.. EU is excluded in this Stress Test..
---
So yes. I shall cry with you in EU tears.
---
guy in that group is saying it takes 36 hours a week to raid during classic?
---
is he on meth? or is that how long it takes?
---
I envy most people in this thread.

Yea i thought so 😂😂😂. Of course you know that as soon as you’d have to show your face you’d shut the fuck up, because you how big of a beta orbiting failure you are lmfao
---
Hey, you can unsub and stop posting then, it's going to be 1.12 and they won't change the values. You don't need to play, and it doesn't seem like it's up your alley.

&gt; I think I once heard that most players back then didn't even reach 60. 
---
From the best I can tell, this statement is completely apocryphal.  I've tried to find a source for it but have been unsuccessful.  I think someone took the old statement about Naxx and exaggerated it, and it caught on because it's a fun thing to claim.
---
The only statement I've ever specifically seen from Blizzard about player milestones in Vanilla is the one regarding Naxx - that less than 1% of players ever killed a boss in Naxx.  This is why they brought it back in WotLK.  It's also one of the things I'm really excited for people to experience in Classic - 40-man Naxx.  I find it pretty neat that, despite this game being 14 years old, there's still this piece of content that almost no one has experienced.  I was fortunate to see most of it, but my guild stalled out at 4H - so experiencing 40-man Sapphiron and KT for the first time will be cool for me.
---
I almost understand what you're telling trying to say here.
---
But yes, ret paladins are sub optimal for raiding. They will still be invited. Ele shamans will be invited. Arcane mages will get raid spots. You will see Boomkins in raid gear. Vanilla wow isn't the most balanced wow has been, but no class that performs more than one roll is forced to do only one thing.
---
Blizzard games run really well on Linux too if you want to go a another free route. Things are simple now too with lutris.
---
What a lame post. Ranting about ‘facts’ that everyone should just accept without backing up your claims. If this is the way you present yourself irl then gl in life
---
context. if that guy instantly runs to the next bar to get pissed and starts hitting on random strangers the moment you take away his wow then he definitely fits the man child category quite well.
---
Better you ask in r/chess
---
From what I observed I am not able to agree with you. Some classes require a much higher skill level just to be average, granted they have a higher potential as well. Other classes just need to roll their face on the keyboard to be above average.
---
good shit
---
Hell yeah, I remember having 14-20 FPS in Westfall solo-player experience. MC / Onyx / AQ was a living hell with approx. 10 FPS if I was lucky, lol
---
The reality is that people gonna downvote me for, it that the private servers are the most fun vanilla we gonna have, though it may be not the most authentic. 
---
The parameters about the game they didn't know, private servers tuned by themselfs to be challenging and fun enough to do. So we ended up with a better more fun game. including raids/elites etc.
---
Not to mention they got a proper progressive itemization, with changing stats on items (that blizzard not gonna have), and everyone is in one server without crossserver bgs and other stuff. 
---
Aswell as fixed some most op gold farming techniques, that gonna cripple the official wow economy.
---
Kinda surprised Warrior is so high.
---
Hi !  
---
I would suggest you to read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/89ted0/keftenks_writeup_and_gear_spreadsheet_for_moonkin/dwvmwt3/) from Keftenk.  
---
In my opinion, you can play as Moonkin and still enjoy and finish the game.  
---
Of course you will not have a competitive dps, but is it that important: depens of your goals and your guild ?  
---
The most difficult part for you will be to manage your mana ! Let's farm some pots :)
---
This or something similar is posted every hour on this subreddit, like god damn clockwork. 
---
How the hell havnt all of you who dream of post naxx content not already made your own subreddit so you can leave this one in peace?
---
Just added to my favorites. Gonna listen to this at the gym this evening for sure
---
The trash pulls in Naxx were more difficult than many of the bosses in MC and BWL.
---
The reason why dual specc is bad. As bad in classic as it would be in other popular talent tree based games like PoE for example.
---
There is not a ton of classes really. What defines you outside of your gear to others of the same class is your talent choice and your skill in that class.
---
Being more motivated to stay in 1 spec due to the benefits that spec build has compared to others will give more variation in how players differ from eachother. A good example is warlocks. its good to have 1 warlock a certain spec for imp and the stam buff for tanks while the other locks are a more dps focused spec. Also example a priest with improved fortitude buffing more with that buff than others because he has used some points to be able to be better at buffing. Think what would happen if a priest or druid or the like had 2 specs to switch and switching to the buff spec before switching to the more heal/dps spec.
---
Yeah, if it works as you say it does then it's a good system. Rewarding based on performance can be a problem however. Because sure, if you give the sword to rogue A then he will perform better than rogue B in the future. So what about the next loot? Rogue A is performing better than rogue B, so the best thing for the guild is to funnel more loot into rogue A for raid progress. Rogue B on the other hand is super social and helps guildies a lot, but doesn't have the best connection to the GM or officers, so they might not now about it. At this point any decision is a bad one.
---
In my classic private server guild we had a sort of loot council/random roll system, where people were allowed to roll based on whether they've already gotten an item and whether it is bis for their spec. I think letting people roll is a better alternative to some arbitrary decision based on opinion.
---
But pservers are inherently different. They require more commitment and knowledge to even join and are not tailored to the average user. They attract different people and the bell curve is skewed towards the upper end. Since classic is being openly released it will attract a larger population of average players. During vanillia the types of players you are describing accounted for less than 1%. I do think it will be different this time but will only be around 5-10% of the player pop that will see end game and have any BiS. 
---
It's likely that classic will have a standard bell curve where a small percentage doesnt reach 60 and a small percentage finishes every raid and has BiS. And the majority of players will float in the middle of that
---
You have fucked up. No job = no money = can’t pay the electric bill/internet/mortgage = playing less WoW when you’re homeless.
---
I think players start to realise that the difficutly is not gonna be what they expected. So they don't want the possibilties that make the content more easier to happen.
---
I can understand them but on World buff i think there was a bigger cooldown than private...
---
Super Saiyan?
---
You could also consider warlock, a mage with pet and great in leveling and pvp.
---
Oh my god it's me, without the wife ofc xd
---
Have not read all comments, but cap the bonus roll points to 100. so ppl are forced to spend rather than stockpile, also try not to let points stack too fast.
---
I was looking for this comment. Maybe they will be a traitor to their faction and "identify" as the other faction.
---
i would agree with this post ....the GREAT thing about classic is that at every level bracket there is a ton of content and things to do that will often times make a long lasting impression as opposed to the end game raids.  Level 49 pvp, STV, tarren mill, farming dungeons etc etc etc ....the end game raids are the icing on the cake but the cake is also very good!
---
/r/classicwowplus

Great mentality. Refusing to play because you’re not getting exactly what YOU want. Sounds about right for this day and age.
---
He's a true Rouge then
---
Call in dead
---
But you fuck with everybody else’s game experience.
---
We used to tell the kids to fuck off and go back to CoD
---
Now we are gonna tell them to fuck off and go back to Fortnite.
---
We use loot council for some items and raid roll the rest. So for instance the ultra BiS items like tear, DFT, rejuv gem etc are handled by the council and the rest is either core raider prio or member+. We also encourage core raiders to pass on member loot if there's a better item that is core raider prio. 
---
We've used this system for 3 years now but we've always been slowly gravitating towards a full loot council system. People don't like when loot is seemingly randomly rolled out. 
---
Loot council isn't easy to make work though, I spend quite a long time after the raid looking at players' performance. Sometimes you can also make deals between people. For instance we have this lock and mage both with 100% attendance and really good gear. They both needed tear and wraith blade though so I proposed a deal; when one of those items drop you both roll, whoever loses gets the second of those items that drop. They agreed and a week ago wraith blade dropped. The warlock won and the next tear or wraith blade goes to the mage. 
---
A guild that involves their players with the loot system is far more successful than a guild that just stays behind a curtain. Communication and dedication are they keys to a successful guild.
---
I min-max in every game I play, I'm probably going to min-max in this one.
---
I think you're a bit confused, the only mount which was available during the time(but, not able to be redeemed until TBC) was the Riding Turtle which provided 0% increased movement speed and could be used by a level 1 character.
---
It would prevent some raids to be absurdly crushed because going in raid full of world buff make you 30-50% stronger.
---
But i would prefer a proper explanation on how it was working during Vanilla first

What about mom's home?

Yeah but hasn't that been true of every edition? The only one that doesn't get *that* much hate is 5e, and that's because it's the porridge edition - comparatively simple and aside from that doesn't do anything particularly well or particularly badly.

Because MP5 isn't increasing your dps directly. So this value have a different impact on every boss, depending on it's duration.

No you should level yourself.

I'm not implying that you need to lay the opportunities at the PC's feet. But you can make a world realistic and breathing while still keeping things fluid behind the scenes. Having fluid mechanics and templates help make the world feel alive by providing more freedom for the players to improvise and utilize their talents in unexpected ways. I'm talking about simple things: Don't have one way to solve the puzzle, have multiple ways to solve the puzzle.

Black Sabbath, def Leppard, pink Floyd. My jam when I was 13 playing vanilla lmao
---
I'd really love Blizzard to provide more context for that number.  If you told me 70% of *characters* are abandoned before reaching level 10, I'd believe that.  But 70% of *accounts*?  Sorry, I don't find that feasible.  This was the pre-Steam days, when we all collected games on discount that we never played.  Back then, you were going to a store to buy the game, and if you bothered to do that, I find it impossible that 70% of players only played for a couple hours and then never played again.
---
Kind of funny that there are MMO**RPG**s that aren't focused on adventure. You don't have to be a DnD veteran to understand that adventure is an important part in an RPG.
---
I totally agree that we don't need an overarching storyline in an MMO, I always stop reading quests, dialogue, books etc after a few hours in any MMO I've ever played because there's too much stuff that doesn't matter. Just have the world provide the story that you can choose to discover through exploration, like the Souls games, that philosophy is **perfect** for an MMO.
---
Sure, but in 40 man raids, there is never just 2 people wanting an item. If 1 guys passes as he is saving his DKP for something else, then someone else bidding lower DKP will get a good upgrade.
---
I'm rolling Tauren-Hunter (same as back in the day). Join me brother, For the Horde!
---
Why not the opposite then?
---
A good feral druid can be top 5 dps in MC, it's later that it starts to struggle. But shh don't ruin the narrative.
---
Dummy thicc
---
That is a good idea. I wouldn't cap at 100 probably, but somehing like 200 is a good amount (so you can have a bigger middle-field).
---
Well Texas is similar to Australia minus kangaroos and everything having the potential to kill you. Meanwhile I pay $100 a month for gigabyte internet. 1000 up/down
---
Don't forget ["Ultranumb" by "blue Stahli"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-2jNiVK86A) although that might have been used more in TBC pvp videos.
---
Uhh demon hunter?
---
Yes please link your Instagram
---
Melee weaving is another thing huntards are too stupid/lazy to do. Get a big fat 2h and weave in melee attacks when your auto is reloading. Especially when you are OOM there is no excuse not to do this.
---
How would that work, if several people have RIP, who want the item? A bidding war?
---
Example: An item drops, which 4 people want:
---
A rolls a 30 and has 20 RIP
---
B rolls a 15 and has 75 RIP
---
C rolls a 45 and has 10 RIP
---
D rolls a 48 and has 50 RIP
---
What happens, when A declares, he spends 19 RIP to win the roll? Can C then declare, he spends 5 RIP to win the role? Then D declares, he spends 3 RIP to get the item? Then C declares, he spends 6 RIP to get the item? and so on, and so on?
---
This is a big issue with this system you don't have with DKP. In DKP items either have fixed prices and are giving to the person with the highest nubmer of DKP, who wants the item or bids are sent per whisper to an officer and the highest bidder gets the item. 
---
This system relies on random rolls, which are public and bidding afterwards, which will cause bidding wars, which may last for several minutes. Just saying, that every person can only make one bid, is also terrible, as in my exmaple D would have to spend at least 43 RIP to secure the item, but if B isn't even interested in spending their RIP and only rolled on it, D wasted 35 RIP for nothing as a mere 8 would've been enough to outbid everybody else.
---
The only way to mitigate that would be only actually deduct the minimum RIP needed, so in my example, D would only spend 8 RIP, despite bidding 43. Yet, this still invites toxic behaviour of highly bidding on items, you don't really want to cause somebody else to spend most of their RIP.
---
Rolling for PvP.
---
Go for it. If you end up with the time or desire to enjoy a second character, you'll already have the best farming class ready to bankroll a swift rise to the top
---
I built my wife a new PC so we can play together.
---
Lmfao please send the Instagram link
---
Scarlet Monastery or *Sunken Temple* hmm I wonder which one it is...
---
With the current hype majority of people invited will gladly level to 40 and on the process report any bugs they might have noticed. 
---
If you give everyone a premade level 40 ppl will get bored like some already did. Leveling is fun. There isn't much you can test extra that you couldn't while leveling.
---
My whole post was literally about advocating picking a class you think is fun and learning all the ins and outs of it and accepting the fact that you may not get to do what you want all the time when it comes to end game pve content. My other point was that people trying to convince others to always hyper-focus on min/maxing or else they won't get to do shit are wrong and they should really stop.
---
\&gt; If you are the person that consistently do 50% less damage than the  other people of your same class because you could not be bothered  googling which stats to go for or what your hitcap is, then dont be  surprised when you are the first to get replaced when the guild run into  any sort of trouble down the line. 
---
I guess we're just focusing on DPS still, but anyways, that's literally somebody who doesn't know their class at all. In Vanilla you'd have to be completely oblivious to not know which stats are good for your class, it's stupid easy, so I don't know why you'd even bring this up. If I saw someone doing 50% of someone else's dps of the same class I wouldn't immediately replace them either, like it's obviously an issue in how they're playing. Why wouldn't you try to help someone get better instead of getting pissed and kicking them out then going through another recruitment process? If they refuse to learn or adapt then, sure, replace because they are obviously not going to get any better.
---
\&gt; It has nothing to do with elitism and minmax mentality.
---
Yes, it certainly does, and it stems from the private server community that's gotten so used to speed running raids that they think it should be the norm. You do not need every world buff and consumable possible to clear most of these raids at a decent pace. You don't even need pre-raid BiS, by 60 you should know what stats are good for you and what aren't. If people are flipping out because they spent over an hour in MC then perhaps they should just relax or find another guild which matches their interest in clearing raids as fast as possible. There's literally nothing wrong with min/maxing if that's how you want to play. What's wrong is the people who try to convince everyone else that you *have* to do it just to raid or do anything in PvE, which is completely false and leads to a lot of people stressing out over nothing and not enjoying the game.  
---
\&gt; People dont like wasting time. Even in 2005 guilds would have wanted to play to the best of their ability. But back then most guilds just did  not know any better. 
---
We did play to the best of our ability and we definitely did know better. We really just did not want to spend more hours farming gold and/or mats for all of these consumables or BoE BiS pieces on raids that don't need them. We preferred to get in there and kill shit and have a good time even if it meant we were in there for a couple more hours.
---
No everyone will roll orc for pvp
---
Feral in MC is right behind warrior if they are good. It doesn't start to fall off until later.
---
What does that mean?
---
Planned rolling a Paladin, but my brothers and buddies are rolling Horde instead. 
---
I plan on group leveling with my two brothers who are playing a Shadow Priest and a Frost Mage.  
---
I have Vanilla/BC experience with Druids and wouldn’t mind maiming one again, since I was 12 in Vanilla. 
---
Also kind of thinking Warlock, but with three Clothies, gear may be hard to come by? 
---
What’s a good class to combo with SPreist and FrostMage?
---
15% is quite a bit of damage in my opinion. It's kind of shitty in comparison to a proper spec, but not Ret levels of shit, if that makes sense.
---
Well raw DPS output is only 1 of many factors that go into loot decisions. A good council would also be mindful of gear discrepancies and even the super hardcore loot councils still try to spread loot a bit so that everyone feels properly rewarded for their contributions. If guilds aren't doing these things then they're just not a good guild, and there's bad guilds regardless of what loot system they decide to implement.
---
Lol imagine rogue play actually being that low
---
I have 2 friends and I who are looking to level / do dungeons together while playing. We want to have a tank, healer, and a DPS in horde. I was thinking a warrior and priest since they seem to be the most in demand for endgame, but the DPS guy kind of wants to roll warlock. I was just thinking that the warlock and priest might have to share gear. Would you recommend we change up one of the classes? Anyone doing anything similar and have a similar setup? I’m just trying not to have to split too much gear. Also any advice on if we add a fourth person?
---
My take on DKP is a little more guided. Like if an item is not BiS it should be discounted, heavily if needed and anyone can buy it. If an item is BiS, then it cost more DKP and only people it's BiS for can bid or buy it. That way people can either choose to save up a bit more for the big upgrade or cash in on a bunch of smaller upgrades.
---
I know it's not perfect, but I've never lead a DKP system, but as a general member this is what I think would work best  for me.
---
Lmao I know what you mean. Seems like people just want to be negative and upset about things typically. I tried playing Nostalrius PVP and the experience was horrible, no enjoyment of the game just incredible min-maxers and no-lifers making it hard to raid with what I would call unrealistic expectations for guilds. I did find a group on Lightbringer PVE that was very helpful but the server was basically dead.
---
I think your experience is really cool albeit bittersweet. My wife and I along with a few other friends are deciding on how we want to play (faction, pvp vs pve) but for some of them it's their first time. That one guild I played with on LB is going but they want to be PVE which I feel does detract from some fun in the game. Let me know where you end up we may come tag along if that's ok.
---
The feeling's mutual mate.
---
Thats the point though, a good/normal guild has legendaries only on loot council.  
---
Now, if the Janitor raids as much as the doctors....then they are all on the same DKP, so said Janny can match any Docs when a good item drops. 
---
Dont know many guilds who'd happily let folk come unprepared. Pugs maybe, but not guild runs.
---
Then you just haven't experienced a good loot council. Or maybe there was a reason why the butthurt people didn't get loot you know? If someone thinks the system is unfair then there are officers to talk to, if you just rage and quit the guild then that's not very constructive is it?
---
Honestly: Feral can be decent even in a raiding enivroment and for the activities you plan to do.
---
Same goes for Paladin. Remember since you can fill all roles with those classes you'll be more efficent in the little time you hace to play
---
I used to play Human Mage (hell, been my main through all expansions) and it's fine. 
---
Organized PvP (BGs) is much different from world PvP so even your Racial isn't entirely worthless (it's pretty clear that there's a Rogue on that seemingly unguarded Arathi flag). Other than that, don't minmax. It's not worth it 99% of the time. We need some Dwarf Priests for Fear Ward, but other than that you'll be fine.
---
Escape Artist is not THAT valuable on one of the most mobile classes in the game. Yea it's pretty useful, but not "I must play Gnome" useful for mages at least. For Warris and Rogue that's a different story. Being able to cleanse that Fnova to avoid getting shattered is huge.
---
My partner and are taking twelve days off to play Classic. We plan on reliving our days of minimal sleep and maximum playtime, except this time we are adults and we make the rules in this household.
---
Idk, if I'm average Andy just joining the guild I wouldn't expect to start getting rewards too.
---
Hey look another idiot posting about post-naxx BiS competitive dps
---
News flash nobody cares
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Yeah bro. Update / restart the launcher, if you are US and have an active sub you'll get in.
---
That’s not Kamelot or Dragonforce or Blind Gaurdian.
---
It really is! Mine started at the end of draenor, it really helps doing M+ too in retail
---
Infected Mushroom for me :)
---
Just a bit of background: I've always main'd a warrior from the beginning of TBC to MoP hardcore then played legion super casually.   Through TBC I tanked a lot of raids but I was also heavily into PvP.  I switched to dps warrior during WotLK so I guess I'm pretty versatile when it comes to the class.  However, days of serious commitment are long behind me.  I now have a full time career and a family of 3 to take care of.  (I'll realistically play \~12-16 hours a week)
---
With this being said, is warrior still a safe bet for me in Vanilla or should I go with something catered more to casual play? I don't expect to raid (much) and don't expect rank 14 PvP but I would like to at least make rank 10 and not have to struggle with gold when I can be online.  Opinions are appreciated! Thanks!
---
Same here my man! Robinson Township :)
---
Things don't become less funny the older they are lol?
---
Dark lady watch over us
---
My favorite song!
---
 Not sure if I should play Warrior or Shaman,
---
On one hand I really like enhancement Shaman, running around slapping people up in PVP with wind fury on a 2 hander while throwing in frost shock mid fight. 
---
But people have consistently said Enhancement and elemental have little place in max level PVE content and I’ll probably have to go resto.
---
On the other hand Warriors have that get up in people’s face and produce giant critical hits, one shotting people.
---
But they apparently level super slow, miss alot of their attacks, are weaker when leveling and have no heals.
---
My main focus is to play dps in BGs but obviously I’d need gear from PVE as well
---
Thanks for your input
---
Oh thought it was the official one since previous ones have specified "Beta Stress Test"
---
Thank you for your input

---
I mean they can DPS in 20 man content and like farm status MC to help boost a caster group DPS numbers. But in a progression setting might be better to heal. On ND we brought a boomy to our ZG speed clears. They helped our mages do a lot of extra damage in the ZG and AQ20 speed clears. They have a place helping in higher gear levels. So let them meme.
---
Even at the highest level of play rogues will underperform compared to a warrior. And while a fury warrior can easily swap out some gear and help offtank, taunt loose adds, use aoe taunts for trash clearing etc, rogues bring almost zero utility outside BWL.
---
1-10 hunter is.... not bad. But their melee is trash and they can still struggle if pulling two mobs. It's when they hit 10 they sky rocket above all else. I'd say warlock is probably #1 1-10 as they're the best at handling two mobs just because they get imp so early.
---
&gt; Not the retail expansion ones, but new and simple ones. Maybe another 40v40 like AV with PVE aspects in it too.
---
40v40 av like with pve.. simple?
---
Also the problem with just making more 60 raids and dungeon with increasingly better gear is how ridiculously stronger someone with the latest gear will be compared to a fresh 60.
---
Personally i like how tbc added tier sets for all specs and balance them out to increase versatility.
---
What i think i would like is something that still plays like vanilla but has more raids per tier with a greater amount of item sets overall. However i think this wouldn't help much as people would still quickly figure out what items are bis for every spec making all other items obsolete.
---
I can't make up my mind, and I'm stuck between four classes. Basically, I need some helping deciding between four classes.
---
* Hunter (First Character in Vanilla, mained through TBC)
---
* Priest (Alt during the time, main from Wrath through Cata)
---
* Warlock (Never Played One)
---
* Druid (Same)
---
My play time will be fairly limited with having three small kids, so at most I'm looking at four hours of play time a week on average. I'd like to raid eventually, but if I'm being realistic the chances of consistently raiding are pretty slim. On that same token, I haven't ruled out PvP or focusing mostly on five man dungeons. I'm not sure which direction to go...familiar vs new or solo vs group.
---
Horde is a good choice for playing WL, cause it sucks being alliance Lock when 90% of Horde are undeads. That being said.
---
For pvp I would choose mage. Especially as a frost mage you have so much CC that can save your ass and is really useful in Group pvp. Sheep alone can Change a whole pvp Situation to your favor.
---
Warlocks lack the mobility, cc and survivability of a mage.
---
Nah the guy can DM me .I’m not talking to you. Neither am I trying to prove anything to the rest of the authist gang, just this specific example  up there, since I like how he’s projecting his own live into his comments.
---
It was that way in vanilla.  It's the redheaded stepchild of that area.  It sucks at pretty much every role.  You can be a gimp dps, gimp healer, or gimp tank.  But someone has to mop up that tier gear.
---
What is wife?
---
Yes they should reward both, but the system only rewards time spent. Unless Blizzard fixes the queue mechanics so that premades face premades more often. But then you'll lose honor per hour which is the sole reason you're in there.
---
Okay so your embarrassed to show your face after acting that cocky? 
---
Woof
---
Not true. It was originally because paladins could fear all forsaken but that was removed. There were numerous things like this in beta that didn't make it into production.
---
Thats another issue. DM designs an encounter for 4 people. Rogue triggers it while solo stealthing.
---
A few advantages to Classic.
---
- we're all starting Day 1. not 6 months in, not a year in when we joined the hype train. But right at launch of phase 1.
---
- We have ~15 years of WoW experience. We know our keybinds. We know how to theorycraft. We remember the instances (mostly). 
---
- Molten Core 20 is easier than any introductory raid ever. Zul Gurub is easy. 
---
- We know the content, we've seem a lot of it. We're re-experiencing it. Less 'omg i'm going to miss X', if life gets busy it gets busy.
---
So unless you want world firsts in Classic, life will be relatively easy. The grind is longer, you have to work harder for your gear and progression and gold. There's also a known finish line, avoid alt-itis and you'll be fine.
---
did the spectral tiger not have a level 40 and 60 version available to you when you redeemed the code?
---
Just take a pic of your drivers license and send it with the ticket. That bypasses all security questions or emails
---
Da's what I do! ^^(Ya!)
---
If they decide to go farther than Classic--IF--then they already have that content done and dusted. Outland. Northrend. Those plot points are written, that content is developed. I don't know if they'll go down that road or how they'll do it if they do, but I don't see them going out of their way to develop extra things to run in an effectively antiquated environment updated to be serviceable in a modern framework.
---
It's not just because I don't like the idea of "alternate realities" from how things unfolded in WoW over the years, or because new players would be confused as all hell because suddenly all the lore videos don't make any sense because someone decided "Northrend is a myth" and changed it (even though Northrend was established in the lore before WoW even began development). It's because *the people want Classic WoW.* They don't want new plot points, new systems, new dungeons and raids. There's already retail for that. They want Classic WoW to be Classic WoW, and that's the *whole point*.
---
There's another sub for ideas to expand Classic beyond Classic. This is the wrong one. ;)
---
I think you took his comment to seriously.
---
Surerly dwarf female main
---
It’s about min-maxing. If you are fretting over the stats between Robes of the Exalted and Truefaith (such as the OP), you have a concern for min-maxing. You would want to take the item the provides more efficient stats. Also, since you’ll presumably be wanting to be more efficient, only 1 priest will be holy in the raid. The rest will be PI spec’d, which means you won’t have Spiritual Healing (barely out of reach) so it’s not *just* 6mp5 you are missing out on at that point. As a whole, this very much does impact speed and efficiency.
---
For replacing healers for farm. Even though I don’t see how this is relevant... Do as we do on live. See if any healers want to sit, whether they don’t need loot or just want time to chill. Rotate them in and out on the basis of whether they need loot from certain bosses. No healers want to sit, fuck it, doesn’t matter. It’s farm, it’ll die faster regardless.
---
Question: is multiboxing legal?
---
People are so hype about shaman because of youtube videos / cdew. Yeah the crit are insane and it's fun to OS people. But what they doesn't show is this only some times. Most of the time you will be like a ret pal.
---
How tf do you run 40 WoW accounts at once? Do you own a supercomputer?
---
A lot of the streamers and bloggers on the beta testing are loving it.
---
The war against the horde is very serious.
---
Trust Company was the album I played while leveling
---
The transition patch is the pre patch. 1.12 was not the pre patch for tbc
---
&gt; for example reddit seems to enjoy warlocks alot more than you would expect for the average player
---
Is there another survey you are referencing when you say "average player"?
---
I mean yeah, you can make any arrangement work to be honest. It doesn't make it an easily accessible system though. Like I can buy a few drinks for my friends, forget about it and know that they will buy me some drinks in the future or if not it doesn't matter, because we have a special relationship. It doesn't mean that I would do the same with random people that I don't know. Guilds can work the same way. If everyone is familiar with each other then you can do whatever works best, but for a guild to get started I think there needs to be a quantifiable system to build the trust around.
---
ALso what servers have you been playing on (I assume private servers vanilla)? Your name looks kinda familiar.
---
I can't believe he went out of his way to download and upload the video here rather than just linking it so Casually Explained can get credit for his work.
---
As a Rogue player I can confirm this math checks out
---
I am thinking of playing a horde warlock to mainly PvP, but will dabble in raids.
---
 That being said, what is the best spec to level and what is the best for PvP? I'm not looking to hit High Warlord, but to be competitive enough to hold my own and try and hang with the rank 7-10ish players.
---
The best solution is the simplest but requires medium brain power without too much ego getting in the way which is near impossible when it comes to people. Especialy depraved no lifers who long for something flashy to show the gaming world.
---
You find a group of dedicated players and you gear them as they go. Just like in the first few runs of MC where everybody has the same shitty DKP and nobody actualy bids- the loot goes straight to the officers and their trusted brown nosed lackeys.
---
In the same way everybody gets a piece when it drops and on it goes until everybody is geared. You serve the guild and the guild serves you. This also eliminates greedy officers and guild masters who get BiS gear before everybody else and then start bringing their alts to the raid and stealing loot from others.

This is only for the "direct" nerf of the content. It doesn't show to indirect nerf from better itemization/spells/talents throught patch.
---
I can't deny that 1.12 is probably the best choice, but you can't deny that this patch is Vanilla in his easiest state.
---
You don't even have to be very hardcore to clear Naxx. Just get 40 people who don't randomly go afk in the middle of a boss fight and you'll be fine. This is admittedly quite hard for many guilds. 
---
Having raided all of vanilla content I wish there existed a heroic version of the raids for those who want difficult content and it's one of the things I'm hoping for after Naxx.
---
It's not gear stealing though and again, this is just stupid compensation from a minority min maxing to hell missing the entire point of classic and mmos but then again people don't play game for enjoyment these days and being hypocritical and compensating for defficiencies is the norm, gotta stroke that small "ego".
---
Mages can't be orcs. Neither can priests. Two very popular classes.
---
Paladin is a healing bitch in classic. Just let your Dream of switching speccs fade away, youre not gonna switch because of Hugh Gold Costs. You can Ret pvp but you wont get a spot in pve Dungeons/Raids.
---
Lock is a decent DPS class for pve, not so good in pvp.
---
Rogue is a DPS monster for pve and also very good for pvp.
---
Depends what you want, but you picked one heal only class and one melee dps and one range dps you Need to decide on what role you want to fit in and then decide. good luck!

It's not the argument I made. Average Andy is not just starting out. I specifically said he took part in 8 raids compared to the 10 raids of no-life Larry. I even said in my original post that a new player SHOULDN'T be able to compete with regular raider when it comes to gear.
---
Ppl have tested you theory and compared to available YouTube videos. There isn't enough evidence that the damage is different. 
---
Have you ever get stuck in some game at impossible. And then a year or two later you pick up the game and just breathe through everything thinking why it was so hard?

Experience, information, skills. You had none of those back in vanilla. Almost like tunnel vision, overwhelmed by everything around you. Now you are able to lift your head and actually see what is going on.

&gt;Yeah but hasn't that been true of every edition?

Sure, but to varying degrees. The dislike for 4e was enough to spawn Pathfinder, and both 3.5 and PF remained more popular than 4e throughout it's lifespan. [Just last year](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0125244dec842c4a7aba21b0c17d7445/tumblr_inline_pa89uhVrB11vq0pt5_1280.png) 3.5 and PF was the second and third most popular systems on Roll20.
---
My advice to you would be to play something you've never played before.
---
Over the years I've played and mained practically every class except lock, mage and priest, so this time round I'm going to be playing mage.
---
My thinking is that classic is going to be a new experience for me (like you I started with hunter in TBC), so I want to inject a fresh class into that experience in the hope of capturing some of the "I don't know what I'm doing and it feels great" from the days of old!

Nah, like I said I’m not trying to prove anything in this sub. I’d just like to see the guys response after being completely wrong about his perception of my person.

Unfortunate not. They changed names and also prepared more servers.

None of the comments address a huge factor: the drop off is largely due to the lack of warlocks on alliance (many locks don’t want to deal with undead’s WoTF)

Average age of a gamer is somewhere in the 30's.

Warriors benefit a lot from world buffs which are broken on pservers. Pservers have option to drop an ony buff at any time. In vanilla there was no buff if a head was already turned in within the last 8 hours.
---
Lmao, i've never seen him like this, whats happening to him
---
Only race to play as a priest. 
---
God now I'm second guessing myself.  I played a priest on a popular private server last year.  Just long enough to hit 60 and spend about a week grinding some dungeons.  At that point I was content with being excited for classic and I didn't play again. 
---
I enjoyed the leveling experience as a priest but being forced into healing at 60 I didn't love.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy healing dungeons and raids but to grind mobs for rep or gold as a healer is not particularly fun.
---
So at least 57 of these people have no clue what Classic is.
---
That's probably why private server players wanted an official Vanilla, they were expecting real values to be harder than private. While Classic is litteraly easier than pserver but with the correct values
---
whats the mobs name? or mb u remember what recipe does he drop?
---
So work is going to flex on you and purge the curse...?
---
Even in 40-man raids you have people passing on good upgrades because there is a really good upgrade on another boss. I remember disenchanting many upgrades from BWL because they would rather want the bigger upgrades in AQ, but we never got there because people skipped upgrades.
---
rogue and hunter are physical dps whereas wl is magical dps. so you will cast a lot... youre a CASTER.
---
you dont have the melee dmg that rogue and hunter provides and you dont have the survivability of a hunter let alone a rogue.
---
youre a cloth wearer now.
---
you need to be more careful what fights you engage cause you cant really escape, ofc if you get a nice fear off you can run or slow with a curse but overall you will need to tank all dmg and get your dmg out while casting.
---
thats a decision you have to take because playstyles of casters differ heavily from physical dps classes.
---
Mmm, I tend to not watch streams and I think I'm going to keep it that way.
---
I would join "Server of Edward the Odd"
---
They won't do it. Some of those realms still exist in BFA and they probably don't want to have two realms with the same name concurrently. Also, it could be alienating to new players to have a pre-established server history/culture.
---
"with the time i got left" still sounds to me like hes sick or something, thats more likely then someone playing wow and beeing economically independent
---
Ummm.. Tauren?
---
Any guild worth its salt is going to be looking at attendance and ability to do raid mechanics over dps even for warriors/mages/rogues.
---
For you.
---
People on reddit will inevitably find a way to hate it.
---
ive got an active sub but no option to download it, do i need to install bfa?
---
Poor man's Feign Death lol
---
It’s “fun and exciting” until someone’s been in the guild for a long time with a piece that’s been bis since pre-raid then loses a significant upgrade to a much newer member because of a crap roll. You could have one of your oldest members continually lose rolls over and over again, even with the weighting (until they accumulate enough roll credit to have it guaranteed).
---
Overall, I think all loot systems have flaws. But I personally wouldn’t want to use a system that leaves upgrades to chance on top of the chance it drops.
---
I think Loatheb did actually require 2 shadowpots just due to mechanics assuming all else went well.
---
Well for Shaman yes you are right only 1 max 2 Enhancer per 40 raid, for the advanced totems in the Meele warrior group.
---
Ele is the king of the PvP with burst and stuff (like any PvP class you need the equipment to perform).
---
Overall warrior is the strongest class in classic.
---
Best tank and best dmg.
---
But VERY very VERY equipment depending.
---
If you have a healer behind you as warrior you are the machine of PvP and also in PvE a must. But there will be a lot of competition, first the Tanks will get their gear, and then den fury warriors and in each raid there can be up to 10 warriors total. 
---
But boy they are strong.
---
All NA and oceanic players according to the post
---
Isn't there an addon that allows you to read the text while you're on the run?
---
Good thing that guy gets "healed" by the evil influence by said work, family, wife and life obligations.
---
The problem is that progressing gear just continues to inflate everything. It's not scalable. After a while this progression is just an illusion. You get more powerful (more HP and dps) and so do the bosses. What's the point? There comes a time where that's no longer progression -- at least not *satisfying* progression.
---
You're much better off, in my opinion, developing robust "horizontal" progression systems -- plus doing everything humanly possible to keep your economy healthy (so gold remains a worthwhile motivator). I think unique set bonuses, cool abilities/procs tied to unique weapons, and unique boss encounters are the best way. The latter being the key here. Unique bosses/raids make BiS no longer a thing. It's not just about raw numbers. You can add epic quests to get items needed to down bosses, for example. Once WoW went "all-in" on the ilvl "gear check" model, things got worse.
---
"Collections" are another solution (i.e., more cosmetic-type things) but not as sexy, to me.
---
The dark portal is how Orcs got to Azeroth. It existed long before TBC. TBC is the reopening of the portal.
---
be asured that 90% of warriors of charts wont hit lvl 60 because lvling as a warrior is fcking pain and I mean it when I say FCKING PAIN.
---
once you get to 60 they will lay a red carpet in front of you and youre welcome in any dungeon / raid because tanks are always needed and furys are top dps.
---
I bought a gaming chair and completely regret it - make sure you check brand reviews people!
---
Pretty sure their lawyers would tell them not to do anything that could be construed as an official endorsement of people pirating their IP.
---
Trolls berserk has always looked pretty nice. I just hope I can handle that player model
---
Sure but i dont want to play a cow
---
Then they didnt play the game. They played a part of the game. They tried the game.
---
Yeah that does seem to be a problem. I mean you COULD say that you put your RIPs before the roll on the table. A kind of risk vs reward tradeoff. If you lose you get your RIPs back, if you win, your invested RIPs are spent. That would force people to decision BEFORE rolling and negate the bidding wars. Naturally going all in while noone else bids any points would be retarded, so bid wars would happen before the rolls aswell with an element of randomness to them... I don't know man. Humans suck.
---
Thank you sir.

---
Yes... but actually no?  
---
Please explain why you think so. It shall be fun.
---
Yeah on Horde you either have undead abusing 3min devouring plague or Trolls stunning you. Good times.
---
I wonder what happens if your server was retired? I played on Bloodhoof in Vanilla and I'm pretty sure they spun that server down years ago :(
---
Perception requires just that: perception. You get one shot at it assuming you know a rogue is around.
---
Any horde rogue looking to jump a human will know it's probably off CD. It's not too hard to force and even then, running straight in in stealth will still probably net the jump most times.
---
It's really good in duels and situations where you know a rogue is around but that's it. The majority of the time you don't so...
---
Or were just deciding to roll trolls irl.
---
Except it’s actually content this time, and quite a lot to boot
---
You're supposed to be beta testing all the content between 1-40, making sure all quests, mobs and items function properly. 
---
Yes, the lvl 40 twinking/meme stuff streamers are doing to pass time seems fun. But their job is to create hype, the vast majority of players in the beta are there to find bugs and errors to fix.
---
Why, lets hear 30 min of him defending himself against some troll!
---
&gt;it really builds the game's mystique, creates a sense of awe/wonder/hugeness/etc. when you have some content that's really scary that most people can't even touch.
---
"Awe + wonder" just comes from not having access to all of the knowledge and it being a first time experience. Today there are guides with videos that show down to the detail of exactly where to stand, where to move, what to watch out for, when to use cooldowns etc... and these guides + videos come out *before the raid is even released...* Back in 2005-2006 there were no guides or videos up, so it was all new to you. That will not be the case this time around, the guides for vanilla fights are all there already.
---
We don't have that kind of statistical data from original vanilla. And private server data is not accurate. 
---
So any answer here is just an opinion.
---
just saying that rogue lvling goes smooth as a warm knife through butter,  you wont have any problems at all.
---
im always wondering about some decisions here, you have to be clear if you like to CAST or to HIT. 
---
the playstyles are so completely different that you would think people choose easily.
---
good luck
---
Never said u had to be hardcore to clear naxx. Read again.
---
Probably 90% of mages are mouth breathers in pvp and pve. They get tunnel vision pressing 2 and focus on boss health/ktm/damage meters then die to mechanics. In pvp they don't sheep, break other's sheep then complain that someone broke their sheep on the off chance they actually used poly. Peel? Naw dude gotta use that nova for the sick auto crit damage. 
---
The 10% tho... good stuff. Strong class. But there's not much inbetween.
---
Counterargument: hunter.
---
Stun resist is good, but RNG. An on-demand fear breaker that almost completely invalidates 2 classes in PvP is too attractive to ignore.
---
Lootlist is the best system. Can't be gamed.
---
They may be two games, but they're under the same subscription and there will 100% be people who play both. Preventing possible confusion, even if it's unlikely, is probably a good idea.
---
The difficulties in Vanilla were more about resistance gear, getting 40 people to show up and mostly know what to do, and threat management.
---
Warrior... For all things. But rouge can rock in PvP in dungeons if you have to look for Tank and heal it will be hard, unless your ShaddowPriest is also willing to heal im dungeons
---
Because everyone loved what arena and resilience did to the game right?
---
Seriously, those two things ruined pvp for me.
---
&gt; No one cares about your feelings. You are never forced to participate in low level PvP if you think twinking is both cheating and ruins the game for others.
---
Saying it is cheating is not quite right, it's more like playing a deliberately highly antisocial strategy because spoiling the game for everyone else is fun for you personally. It's a dick move, and nobody would ever willingly play with you if they knew you would do it, but it's not cheating.
---
&gt; No one claimed to be the center of the universe when making twink
---
But to do it, you have to assume that the pleasure you get out of seal-clubbing levellers justifies it, even though you know you are ruining the game for others and getting nothing out of it yourself.
---
On some level you have to know that the game would be better and everyone would be happier if you just deleted your toon. But you don't. You log on and grief people who can't fight back because that makes you feel good.
---
&gt; Let me remind you people are allowed to have fun in any way they seem fit in classic.
---
Let me remind you that it is 100% guaranteed that you are being a douchebag if you have to change the subject from "what I ought to do if I am a decent human being" to "what I can get away with". Yes, you are "allowed" to twink. That doesn't mean you don't deserve to be shamed for it.
---

---
Loot council should legit be bannable.
---
Do it as Prot, and everyone will love you.
---
Your JOB, as a tank, in Classic is to make sure everyone hits you in the face. That is your ONLY JOB. 
---
And to do your ONLY JOB as good as possible, this means hold aggro and have survivability. BOTH are much easier to attain as Protection Warrior. Healers will love you for being easy to heal. DPS will love you because you can hold aggro.
---
Yes, you can do it as Fury, or Arms...but healers will despise you for that, even if they don't say it. DPS will also despise you for not being able to hold aggro.
---
Do it as Prot. Because it is the PROPER WAY to do it.
---
You have no idea how many people will say : "Finally, a proper tank!".
---
&gt;if you assume
---
With bad gear and focusing on PvP and limited time, I'd rule out priest first and I'd put hunter at the top of the list, then warlock, and since you've never played a druid then I'd put that after lock because they take some serious getting used to and it's not for everyone.
---
So, my advice would be to go hunter. I like alliance, but honestly for PvP Orc is going to be your best bet. Level up BM, then go MM/surv and PvP and PvE with this spec  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZiVohthtf0Vwoh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZiVohthtf0Vwoh) . People will shit on it, but orc gets 25% stun resist, with surefooted you get 15% resist to movement imparing effects, plus it makes for an easy hit cap of 5% for PvP and certainly much easier to get a 9% PvE cap. You get 8% chance to stun on concussion, Scatter, Trueshot which groups will appreciate, imp wing clip which is 20% chance to snare in PvP, extra HP from survivalist, clever traps for longer CC in both PvP and PvE, deterrence for PvP when melee jump into your face, aimed shot, longer range.  You can farm easily and do whatever you need to do including raid casually if you can hit cap 9% which is most important for that stuff.  Just my $.02.

You have not much else to spend rage on at this point

#BEST BUFFS IN THE FUCKING GAME  
---
*"How long do they last?"*  
---
#FIVE FUCKING MINUTES
---
I've got plenty of member berries
---
It currently does not work due to meleee leeway...
---
Huumm.... Seeing Rogue so low might make me reconsider and roll one instead of Warrior just to be more of a novelty.  
---
But maybe it's just people on Reddit being hyped over warriors. Fuck I don't know.
---
Thats a good question- I would open a ticket or use your existing ticket and ask a GM.
---
I know you are talking about that song. I just don't understand what the airplane stands for. I'm German btw.
---
Yea I hate seeing people on here describe themselves as "casual players" and then say they plan to raid 2-3 times a week. 
---
Compared to the average player there is nothing casual about that.
---
Agreed. WoW is 100% about raiding for me.
---
Warrior over enhancement Shaman for sure for PvP. If you're going elemental though, shaman hands down. 30/0/21 for shaman is insanely good for everything
---
Installing. More to see how long the install/download takes than for any expectation of actually playing... O\_o Playable... before I finished typing this.
---
1. you know you wanna play physical dps - check
---
2. you know the pros and cons of each class - check
---
3. you want an easy lvling experience? - go rogue
---
4. you want to be a bad ass in plate armor? - go warrior
---
5. respecc is a bitch - go rogue
---
Yeah, but bidding before the roll is even worse. Imagine, you bid a big chunk of your RIP, then roll a 100 and the rest gets 20 or less. You just wasted a ton of RIP for no reason. This is the worst feeling you can get at looting.
---
It's slow, but any build will work for a Paladin leveling. In fact I think every build in the game *can* level to 60, they just have a harder time than others.
---
Although on paper everything in TBC seemed to be improved, for me it was a major letdown.
---
I'm rolling on Krol Blade.
---
Conspiritard
---
This happened to us a few times. Lucky our rogue core was used to evasion tanking while we regained control of the fight.
---
Well, what people intended to play at release and what they ultimately hit cap with may not be the same.
---
Arena gear was tuned different. Why would you want resilience on your PvE gear? Your guild must have only looked at the "power level" of the gear.
---
moreover as a healer its still complete hell healing a prot paladin vs healing a warrior. Druids are far better aswel.
---
Wow. Someone who can think for himself. Thank you.
---
I disagree with you, and do think you sound a bit negative about it.
---
However raiding end game is definitely a different beast. You're suddenly accountable to 39 or more other people in your guild and competing with them on attendance/farming/etc. Its something that by its nature requires you to give it priority over your life; you can't just stop a raid and come back later like you can with leveling.
---
I do agree that raiding isn't the whole game, there is so much fun had at new release 1-60 and preraid grinding and most of it is very non committal
---
just saying that priest leveling is really smooth.
---
you wont be fast but you just wont die.
---
if you want the adrenaline rush of ganking lowbies while questin - go rogue
---
if you want to stick being a healer and have relaxed lvling - go priest
---
It totally depends on your spec. If you are deep ret then bad news friend, its auto attack city.
---
FOTM my ass.  They've always been poular
---
Yeah as much as I wanted to like their new stuff it's just... not the In Flames I fell in love with.
---
I just learned they weren’t saying “fire fly” 😶
---
You could aruge that chance plays a role outside of the game aswell. Imagine being one of the most dedicated players in the guild and then having some accident or something really serious come up on one raid night. That's chance. You didn't plan for it, but now Larry is GUARANTEED to get the item you also wanted just because he participated in one more raid than you did. Is that fair? Chance is part of the game directly and indirectly already. Adding some random chance to gear distribution just reflects that.
---
Why do you assume there would be no bugs in 60 content?
---
The feels!
---
makes me wanna be them more
---
Mage would be more effective in the gear you will be able to gather without setting foot in a raid. Warlocks are a bit more gear dependent as they tend to face tank more and need more stamina as a result. Hard to get high Stam and high spell damage in dungeon gear.
---
Paladin actually isn't bad if you have a huge Netflix backlog.
---
Never understood the appeal of his stream personally, to each their own I suppose.
---
This sparks joy
---
This thread makes me feel like I'm at home.

hmmm.
---
lbrs gfpp/reaper recipes
---
why not go shaman? you have caster dps like mage and wl (you both like) and you have healing capacity - VERY good healing capacity for dungeons and raids.
---
for me it sounds like youre the type of the perfect shaman player, you have experience as a caster and you like to heal.
---
welcome to the ranks of the mighty shamans
---
That's a good point. We've had a lot of discussions about what to do with loot the first few months because with our current squad pretty much everyone will have 100% attendance. So DKP doesn't quite work, rolling is annoying and council is very hard with so little data. Another idea is that we carry over some of the data from the private server. So for instance three of our raiding locks will stay for Classic and they have different raid stats, but that's not really fair either. I have no correct answer to that, but in the long run we've had tremendous success with loot council. 
---
I've played on many servers now all the way back to VG and the really bad servers that existed before Nost. My name is only used for Reddit though so if you've seen it elsewhere it's not me.
---
I know the racial skills could be a deal breaker, but I'm rather a what feels right to be played kind of guy. Created my first orc shaman because I loved the units in WarCraft 3. But since then, I've become a big fan of the trolls as well. So it makes it a bit harder to decide.
---
So?
---
Tremor totem breaks MC and Fear too.
---
So I'm in a similar boat and I ended up landing on paladin (for now). I love the class fantasy, and it also allows for some fun with different hybrid builds. Despite what some people might tell you here, I've done a lot of research and -- with the right gear -- you only need to put 21 points into holy to be a decent healer. This means you can be really open for experimentation. Holy/prot reckoning can heal with some fun burst. Spelladin looks more viable as people test seal mechanics on beta (a ret/holy build that stacks spell power and a fast weapon for high SoR damage). Deep ret is a thing in BG's too that brings great oh-shit buttons for defense and okay off-healing. Lots of options. 
---
Only downside is if you don't find melee swings satisfying it can be boring with low APM, but I'm sure you know that.
---
Female dwarves look extremely similar to male dwarves.
---
Discovered In Flames 13 year ago with a 1v1 world pvp video of a UD lock in Un'Goro Crater; started listening to death metal and eventually alot of other metal subgenres thanks to it :D
---
Exactly the reason why I have been watching more and more of his streams - the 20 and 30 year olds that tell someone how to play is exactly what made BFA and wow what it is today.
---
If you give a fuck what someone else is playing, get your life together. It's not one way or no way - if people want to play ret or balance fucking let them... no need to shove it down their throat that "you should be doing this"
---
It's the same shit with racials - anyone that asks "what racials should I choose" is just fucking themselves over in 3 months when they don't give a shit about their character because someone else decided "you have to go human for the sword racial"
---
Ridiculous and it's hilarious that the people that want classic the most are the first ones to tear down anyone who chooses to play differently than them.
---
Sad and disappointing.
---
Oh. You're just saying it couldn't be announced in time for August? Yeah. They could still do an episode about classic a few months after launch. I don't think they will, just because it would be a retread of things they've already done.
---
ugh no
---
You dont need to be prot while leveling. Hell I remember plenty of end game tanks that weren't deep prot.
---
Perhaps you misspelled "hug." Would you like one? 🤗
---
I'm a bot, and I like to give hugs. [source](https://github.com/as-com/reddit-hug-bot) | [contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=as-com)
---
plus it can crit &amp; apply deep wounds off the bat, not bad.
---
after reading a lot about different classes in vanilla I found out that rogues are one of the worst for leveling...so I kind of switched that to priest or warlock.  
---
I actually think that I will try to force my wife to try this as well, then level one char while we play together and one solo.
---
In vanilla before Arena was a thing, who were the players that dominated PvP? The raiders who also were doing Nax. Because nobody could compete with that gear. Even having full High Warlord would only put you close to par with them and that was stupid hard to get.
---
Not saying Resilence was a good thing, players that just wanted to PvP got stomped by raiders.
---
lol I leveled a Paladin once immediately after TBC came out, so I'm sure the experience would be almost identical (prior to the XP boost patch).
---
It wasn't too bad.  If memory servers around 40 I switched to prot and just aoe tanked packs of mobs.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2el2b/here_are_some_results_of_the_survey_from_the/
---
If you love warrior then play one. That being said, Warrior is so gear dependent and it's so tough.  You'll be pretty OK with Rank 10 gear and unstoppable force mace, but it won't be crazy good. However, you can always tank 5s for your money and off pieces.  The main thing to know is:  are you going to be playing mostly solo or with people in groups? Warrior is REALLY difficult if you don't have people to group with, so if you're flying solo I'd avoid the class personally. But you can definitely make it work if you really want to.
---
I think what OP is getting at is they would have the *same* experiences over again if they could, but thinks that wow classic will be different from their original experience and may disappoint. So they are essentially posting about how it's impossible to recreate exact experiences (and many people may view vanilla with rose tinted nostalgia glasses) and will be dissatisfied with the recreation.
---
Personally I'm looking forward to it.
---
What do you mean?
---
Whichever you prefer, both are strong and work for shadow. It’s more of a playstyle difference.
---
Hunters were in 1.12. #nochanges
---
I'm pretty sure on private server it's 135
---
Idk, personally I just dislike how alliance models look. Also, horde lore is 10 times more immersive and interesting to me

its like press chain heal, press chain heal, press chain heal,press chain heal,press chain heal,press chain heal,press chain heal,press chain heal,press chain heal

You and me both. I've been painting and putting up new trim, power washing and landscaping to earn my fuck around time.

Will do, ty
---
Nope. End game 60 dungeons and gearing up for pre-raid is extremely fun imo. 
---
Especially the 60 dungeons with a fully kitted character, all your talents being put to work. Also the end game dungeons are a lot more lenient on spec diversity than raiding is
---
Yeah, I played mage in late tbc/wotlk and shadow priest in wotlk. I know mage has more utility and shadow priests are arguably tankier but I feel like warlocks are somewhere between that in classic.
---
welcome to the hunter overlords
---
I was also pretty confused by this. They've literally always been called "Private Servers".  
---
I'm legitimately curious why OP worded it this way.
---
They'll probably both want spell power gear, but I"d say make a deal where priest gets dibs on heavy spirit gear and lock gets dibs on the stam/int gear and just make the best of it. It actually sounds REALLY good to have a lock because you can summon 2 more people all of the time for your 5 man runs and a soulstone!
---
1% of wows population in vanilla saw Naxx or cleared it but still. The final raid of vanilla was barely accessible to the average player
---
&gt; fuck it, doesn’t matter. It’s farm, it’ll die faster regardless.
---
This, but hopefully you will realize it encompasses the entirety of Classic.

I don't have much content created but...

I raided MC as an arcane mage. I went there a few times. We didn't beat Rag. I didn't even have DPS meters installed. I was around 14.  
---
Don't you tell me it was my fault.
---
I don't understand why someone would just want to stand there and be a meat shield.  Glad enough people do I guess.
---
Interesting. I was hoping to be one of the only healers to find groups easily. Damnit 😂
---
Gods, I was geared then!
---
I've been playing a Troll Mage (Arcane) on retail until to get my feet wet until classic comes out. I picked based on Beserk as well. I never picked Troll in the past because the lanky player model seemed strange to me but honestly I haven't noticed it much, just happy to be questing again
---
Interesting to see Warlock so high; over on private servers, level 60 character polling would show Warlocks as the least-played class, right down there with Druids.
---
If you like Druid, go druid. you can tank and the spriest can heal and less competition for gear. Druids are great for grouping with anyone really, they're a swiss army knife.
---
lmao I remember certain cities your character was just lost their for ever if you had one of those PC's
---
bruuuuuuh their new album is so good
---
Yeah you're right, I'd replace wife with other hobbies, also because I don't have a wife.
---
No, the majority of the game in vanilla is the levelling experience. There is far more content from 1 through 59 than there is at 60.
---
She thinks this way because a lot of people that play video games represent the stereotype that that's all they do. She most likely is hoping that you spend a majority of your time furthering your career or spending time with friends/her etc.. She's not wrong. As long as you balance your free time appropriately, you can explain it as such and she may be more understanding. Everyone should be able to enjoy their hobbies without guilt. If she is just selfish and wants to belittle you for it, yeah, dump her.
---
I wish they had some measure to balance this (on PvP servers) it fucking sucks getting to 60 only to realize you picked the server that is mostly dead on your side because the opposing faction outnumbers yours 4 to 1.
---
So much of the negative opinion on warrior leveling is brought about by people trying to minimize their time to 60. Yeah, its a tough class to level if you only do dungeons once and don't get the drops you wanted. Everyone knows warriors are gear dependent. Running each dungeon 2-3 times makes all the difference.
---
I hit level 52 in vanilla, then power leveled to hit outland at release of BC, and I have no regrets taking my damn precious time. I ran dungeons like a mad man learning how to best play my warrior. It taught me how to participate in a guild as a tank, and how you fit into the server economy essentially. This time around I will go and experience true WoW leveling aka struggling in quest zones. It makes you feel part of the world and forces you to engage with others. Truly felt like an MMO even if I never go to see MC or BWL in vanilla
---
in my experience rogue leveling is really easy and fast, you get really good Upgrades along the way that allow you  to Smash Mobs fast and safely.
---
go Combat specc and youre Pretty safe.
---
if you want to cast go priest if you want to hit go rogue
---
Haha thanks !
---
I love how some shamans think they're equal to Paladin in vanilla, wait until they discover what "Blessing of Salvation" can do combined with infinite mana single target healing.
---
&gt; Nah, like I said I’m not trying to prove anything in this sub   
---
&gt;  Do we have to talk on Instagram so you can look into a mirror and realize what big of an incel you are or what? Smfh Gaming community became beyond autistic over the years. 
---
interesting mental gymnastics 
---
congrats
---
Yep its a bug but I really wouldn't give a fuark if they added more races to classic. Affects almost nothing in the game. Except pandas, fuk that race lol
---
get a job lmfao
---
It's fun but it's not as easy - your CDs are long, you don't have CoS, and your combo points don't xfer targets...it's a lot different. I'd read up on it so you don't get blindsided by the differences.
---
But that's a warrior helm.
---
Plus to me Bobby B is a dps not a healer tbh
---
I was good on most fights, but there were several that I had to stare at my feet. Thank God i only had to heal and buff lol.
---
Nothing fucking better than weed n wow
---
Arbitrarily adding chance to it it just making it worse. I could willing inject myself with a life threatening disease to increase my chances of missing out on my daughter’s marriage, but why would I?
---
There’s no reasonable point in willfully adding even more chance on top of all the other chance and luck involved in the game (and life, since you want to add that in).
---
Strange, I never seen that at all in vanilla, tBC or Wrath, and I was in a few high end raiding guilds. 
---
Sure, DEs happened, but only once folk were well geared.  And sure, others did save their DKP for those big drops, but other benefitted from them passing on good loot.  
---
Our guild made each raid (ie MC/BWL/AQ40/Naxx) have different DKP.
---

*one word*

This kind of statistic analysis is deeply flawed for a few major reasons anyway. That’s not a bad thing for anyone just trying to have a bit of fun, or get a really quick look at some numbers, but if you wanted to win an argument this is not the graph to use.
---
Never understood why he is popular and how he got invited to beta. This guy isn't even good at playing and he isn't entertaining at all. (dont tell me how good he was at CS 10years ago)
---
A lot of warriors are going to give up when they learn how miserable warrior leveling is.
---
These wow elitist player could fuck right off
---
I heard they spring out of holes in the ground.
---
going alliance rogue this time around. I'll min-max, but probably won't be a hardcore player. I plan to do a solid mix of pvp and pve. I was thinking about hooman because of the +sword skill, reputation boost, and help with spotting other  stealth. I thought that would be the best for both pve+pvp. Dwarves and Gnomes have some great utility too, so I'm not sure what will be the best overall.
---
I'm EU and have this but it says I can't play yet.
---
People who vote shaman as alliance "hihihi im gonna try and ruin a survey" how sad can someone be :D
---
I love the leveling experience the way it was intended to unfold. Going from one zone to another, getting mild upgrades all the time so loot matters more. 
---
I guess killing people on boats while their computers load the next zone will no longer be a thing
---
In vanilla, it mostly did.
---
I mean, same kinda goes for anything else other than staring straight ahead... might be technically possible but it isn't going to be a good experience.  And that's a pretty specific situation that doesn't apply to the overwhelming majority of the population.

Again mischaracterized lmfao what’s up u was the one with the big mouth. Now come on. DM me your @.
---
It's definitely more immersive to only have one difficulty and having 4 like it used to be is clearly too much. I just find the raids kinda boring in vanilla. MC is a snorefest, BWL is pretty lazy and hosts the worst designed boss in WoW history, ZG is decent but a bit long, AQ40 is annoying as hell with its impossible trash and Naxx is beyond any doubt the masterpiece of vanilla. 
---
I think after Naxx is out and done for a long time they could maybe spice up the other raids a bit.
---
For me it was being a tiny ass gnome I'm dun moroghe (I forget how you spell it) and it seemed HUGE. Then when I found out that was such a small part of the world, it blew my mind. I don't think I'll have the same feeling since I was just a young kid who just got into things like Runescape and WoW, so it was like a new world, but it'll be fun
---
More warlocks than hunters?  No way
---
The "Luck" is the chance the item drops in the first place. Average Andy should know that others put in more time and effort than him and that he may not be the priority on certain loot. Sucks for Andy, but that's reality. Everyone plays this game for the sense of character progression, and guilds that reward the long-term players that show up consistently (like allowing them to accrue DKP and bid on items that they want/need,) will last a lot longer than guilds that would implement a loot system like the one you're proposing. If I'm a consistent raider and I see a guild looking for players but describe a loot system where I could contribute more but lose a desired item to a dice roll, I'm not joining that guild. I 100% guarantee that your loot system would alienate the no-lifers that enable your guild to raid in the first place.
---
Paladin is going to be better support IMO, but shaman is solid just has mana issues. You'll be fine.
---
Seeing as warriors are also the best dps in the game, this isn't surprising
---
Please stop making these the game isn’t even out yet
---
Mixing the badass gamer and hospital gown ascetics I see
---
Ive never played retail but I checked this troll resto druid Jdot(? iirc) and they looked super cool actually
---
Generally agree with this sentiment, but have an issue with the logic of '40 people all being serious and trying their best to beat content' and calling that 'easy'. I progressed through bwl with MC geared people (pserver) and everyone had to try or you'd likely wipe
---
Both solid choices
---
Maybe, just maybe if classic is booming 2 years from now they would do that. I have my fingers crossed but we need the game to borderline kill retail I think for them to do a 2.0
---
Who the hell is using windfury with a 1h as ele?
---
The combination of running and timing auto-shoot is extremely powerful.
---
The warlocks imp is imo overrated. It's not the tanky beast known from private servers. See Kargoz recent leveling videos from beta. His imp literally got one-shotted by "yellow" mobs
---
I wasn't level 60 when the game launched. I took me over 20 days played.

If they’re thinking about realm pops between 3-15k, that means they’re predicting perhaps more than 315,000 testers

Let me play devils advocate here for a bit in place of Beardharmonics.
---
I myself am against gold farmers but what experience do people ruin by buying gold? Don't they only ruin their own experience by skipping the journey and going straight for the goal? If a player hands another player 1000g. Was the experience ruined? If the first player charges the second one for the gold, what changed?  
---
I'm genuinely curious since I don't like gold farmers myself. Don't like the spamming, don't like the ones that run around with strange random names.
---
For PVE: Human gets an absurdly small benefit at all times, Dwarf gets a really good but situational cooldown
---
For PVP: Humans get basically nothing while dwarf keeps their great cooldown that gets even better.

&gt; Escape Artist are useful, although neither is available for Warlocks so there is that.
---
Gnome warlocks exist and they are valid!
---
Paladins do not scale off spirit in raids because they do not have a talent or ability that allows them to regenerate while casting. Druids and priests need spirit, shamans and paladins scale off mp5(or crit in paladin case).
---
The weaponskill can be important in raiding if you plan on playing ret, which you shouldn't because it blows. 
---
Rep is not really a big deal in vanilla either imo, but that could be a deciding factor if any.
---
I kill two dwarves in the morning...
---
Me and a buddy are debating class pairings. We've considered double forsaken rogues.
---
Purge rank 2. Bye bye. Not a single pally, even in T2 could escape my tier 0.5 purging/dps - once I got T2 it was over. I was also 15 at the time, can only imagine the potential now, but alas I’ll be the unkillable disc priest instead. Shammy vs pally: It always resorted to bubble hearth in the end. Paladins are not equal to shamans at all or even close to superior. Maybe a good player could make the difference but good luck. I mean that in sincerity any other assumption on my attitude here is false.
---
Max rank is 140; I've known that for 14 years. Your pserver number is wrong.
---
i was just pointing out that WL is very immobile and easy to Interrupt/piss off.
---
and you know that as a former rogue/hunter Player.
---
as much as i love the class design of wl i would never Play it in classic for those reasons.
---
good luck though
---
Good decision :)
---
I remember to this day that my flip record between Vanilla and TBC times was 7. I felt like a god that day and nobody was there see it.
---
You can set up a NA account if you are in europe and get acces.
---
I hear you on the solo vs group aspect.  I used to be a group player 13 years ago but now (in my older age) lean more towards solo.  I'm still waiting to hear which of my friends will be coming back for classic.  I guess that'll make or break it for me.  I'm thinking Warlock if I expect more of a solo experience.  I do love warrior though and I know I'll have the "you should have picked warrior" voice in the back of my head lol! 
---
Thanks for the response! Cheers!
---
In beta now. 
---
Warlock has been the easiest by far out of all the classes I have played.
---
There was no spectral tiger at the time.
---
And don’t DM it
---
Post that shit here, tough guy

There isn't one specific pet to use in classic like there is now. They all have their uses.

I know we all joke but there are going to be people who will probably lose their job, wife, and custody of kids because of this release.
---
Yeah, fuck raiding. I just wanna mooch about, do some quests, make a little money, mine some ore and pick some herbs.
---
You might be fooled into thinking that this was an actual picture.
---
It's actually a GIF with the vanilla framerate for this many characters in one place.
---
Figures that Horde would be from "somehow worse than New Jersey", a.k.a. Philly. FOR THE ALLIANCE (of Pittsburgh).

Well, they do, and always have.

Was it a cheap one or something like a Secret Labs? Because a couple years ago I got a Herman Miller knockoff for about $200 on Amazon and I find it extremely uncomfortable and was considering ponying up the cash for a Secret Labs chair.
---
Hi! 
---
I actually just paid the $40 for the early guide. I’m excited to use it! 
---
My question is, are the class quests in the guide? Also if they are, does it tell you which ones you can ignore or are they all in there?
---
It's usually the migrations from a server that causes imbalance, not to it. If there was a small initial imbalance, any option to migrate to a new realm will be primarily taken by the weak faction.
---
That's because TCG codes weren't in the game in Vanilla. The cards were there, but they weren't actually added to the game until TBC iirc.
---
Not if your ass is swinging nightfall.
---
Stop posting this garbage

ToS is some arbitrary ruleset made by a company... A sale deal is something more fundamental than that... It's people who give things value... What that guy did was immoral and breaking ToS is not an excuse...  
---
Personally I wouldn't buy an account because I wouldn't feel any pride in having things I didn't achieve myself... I played on p2w tbc server till KJ and never bought an item from their store, even one that I needed but it never dropped for me, for exactly this reason :D... and that was just a few bucks...
---
People like that make our community look like shit. Probably a private server player.
---
Wasn't saying we're not or that different be views aren't all valid.
---
human if you want an edge in pve
---
dwarf if you want an edge in pvp
---
I really, truly, do not understand the point of these videos.  Any scrub can get to level 10 on any character in one or two sessions.  Who cares if it goes 45 minutes quicker or slower here or there?  The stress of making sure you're following the "correct path" just completely sucks the fun out of it.  Especially at this low level when you can literally do no wrong, just PLAY THE GAME and find out how YOU like to play.
---
I appreciate the perspective, I wasn’t really thinking of them as immobile but yeah it’s true. I was trying to mitigate it some by going orc but that would only help so much. How do you feel about Resto druid in both pvp/pve?
---
Summit is not wrong.
---
I'll tank your instance. All drops with text reserved.

You need to be able to last longer than 30 seconds man

I never was into watching Streamers. I am in my 30's and watching people play games I can already play seems silly to me. I did finally start watching WoW classic streamers as I don't have access to the game. Besides Asmongold whom I have actually warmed up to as his humor is pretty close to my own, I usually keep Streamers on mute and get rid of the chat spam.
---
Yikes. This is all over the map. So, if you love priest then level as shadow and it levels pretty well if you go spirit tap, wands, load up on spirit, and obey the 5 sec rule. They're great levelers and can melt faces, plus you can heal instances if you want.  If you can't decide between healer, leveler, rogue...roll a druid and do a bit of everything and they're good at world pvp.
---
Haha, i was thinking that you were thinking "fly", but i was afraid to ask.
---
They simply sing "Feuer frei" = "Fire free" = "Fire at will".
---
I mean, there are times when it's likely a Rogue is present, yes. But, most of the game won't be spent running in to a WSG Flag Room. Also, it's not too hard to hide somewhere out of sight or wait for the person to swing back around. If you catch the player in a sap, Perception is just gonna tick.
---
It's a strong racial when it's used correctly, I fully agree. But MOST of the time you won't really know when to use it.
---
Did you even read the document? It doesn’t mention open world questing at all which I suspect your entire rant was inspired by. Or did you somehow do end-game raiding at lvl 40?
---
I think its entertaining when he calls the no lifers out for being meta whores. 
---
To be fair 90% of the meta worshipers are just shit players who like to hide the fact they have no skill.
---
I raided up to four horsemen in naxx with a BM hunter main and shadow priest alt. (then TBC came out so we never finished naxx)..   unless your guild wants realm first raid kills i don't think spec matter that much in vanilla.
---
 Pros - will make friends and potential future reliable guildmates
---
Cons - boss will know why you have called in sick 27th Aug for a whole week
---
Came here to say that the pictured Disturbed album didn't come out until 2008, lol. Gotta listen to the first album for maximum edginess though (at least as far as Disturbed goes).
---
So the best places to have constructive and logical discussions!
---
It's really weird. As a Horde player I hope every Alliance I come across specs terribly!
---
/u/joshcorbo82 loved the podcast, and had a comment about your Stream Sniper discussion. Curious yours/others thoughts on streamers mistakenly accusing others of stream sniping them? I get that sometimes its easily identified (troll name for griefer about the streamer, repeated targeting, finding them regardless of where they move) but there are some other less easy to identify situations. Is this guy stream sniping or is farming mats in the region and killing any lowbie they see? Is this another faction member just questing through at the same time and getting the better of the streamer every time they see them in the zone? I think there are plenty of opportunities that will come up where a streamer screams "sniper!" but it really isn't the case, and is just someone enjoying the game. Now they've received the "ire" of the community as a result of what would've been considered normal behavior had it happened between non-streamers.
---
I got this Killabee on Amazon for $160: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCZ696Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

Can't sit in it for an hour without my ass starting to hurt.
---
I don't know what to tell you other than the imbalance wasn't just "initial" it was more or less from start until half way through WotLK.
---
Do you know what your /played was to 60? I know arms is much faster but I wonder how you compare to the average leveling time.
---
Lmfaooo not only are you ugly af and your girl barely above average but you could’ve taken that from anywhere. Give me you girls @ then since you “have no Instagram”.
---
rogue &gt;
---
He calls out little punk bitches. Thats good enough for me.
---
Never really understood the appeal of any of them. I can enjoy a 2-3 min youtube clip but after that they move from amusing to annoying fairly fast.
---
This isnt new information, people have been doing this for years.
---
It is rare of course. But I remember my jaw dropping when nobody needed on the hit ring from BWL because they wanted the ring from C'thun. We didn't even have Skeram down yet... So fucking stupid.
---
I'm in the same boat and I ended up creating some characters on a private server to see what they were like and found myself really enjoying Shaman.
---
Idea(a dumb one) a new raid is introduced with gear equal to AQ40 that’s focused on fixing some classes underused specs IE  Shadow Priest, Boomkin, Prot / Retadin, Shaman... something (haven’t played horde in vanilla)
---
For classes that are already good at their role they get a set that flips mechanics on their head. Rogues get tanking tier bonuses in exchange for some dps, warriors do a percent of damage as party hps, etc
---
Gotta throw in Hammerfall with the art up in Spotify, for the OG Samwise Didier art.
---
I live my life by the will of RNGesus.
---
Could you link what chair you got? I've been trying to find a replacement for my current one for ages, lol
---
You will use Warstomp ALL THE TIME if you PvP though, and it is reliable versus having to put 1 point in grasp which is 35% chance so it depends on the swing speed of who's hitting you, etc.
---
You are one sad individual lmfao
---
Same. Rogue has always been my constant, either as a main or first alt, since I started in TBC, all the way through to BfA. But reading about (and seeing) how popular rogues were in vanilla/on pservers, I had second thoughts about it, as I figured Id have a lot of competition for loot (and group spots).
---
Plus the creators seem like they don’t want to make South Park anymore
---
And he said you swing nightfall so attack 40% faster
---
Can mana pots outlast mana drains?  Don't think so.
---
This is the issue here. Folk want Classic wow. Not progression wow.  IF you want progression, then go play retail. 
---
Most folk on this sub, want to play Classic / Vanilla wow, as it was and with little or no changes.   We dont want stuff after Naxx!  Trust me, even in 2 years, very little guilds will be clearing Naxx and killing Kel'Thuzad.  In Vanilla, less than 1% of players even made it to this encounter.
---
I wonder how good multiboxing and just AOE grinding whole your alt tags stuff is going to be.
---
It use to give 100% XP but they nerfed it at some point.
---
So you believe that the 2 raids Andy wasn't present should be weighted so much more than the 8 he visited as to make it impossible for him to get good loot? That's retarded.
---
Same guild as LEEEROOOY? :o
---
for druid Gameplay in pvp i would advice to watch this guys Videos:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4Fn7tCjnFSBATOE0lEekA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4Fn7tCjnFSBATOE0lEekA)
---
for pve druids are tanks and healers, there are a lot of tricks to get the tanking druid going and they can be found in the webs. easiest way is going to heal.
---
if you watch those guys Videos youre gonna love druid, have fun!
---
Smart man. It cracks me up seeing everyone buy these "gaming chairs" that are all made by the same manufactuer in China and just rebranded. All junk.
---
I didn't want to swing the $1000+ for a new one, but I went to a used office furniture store and found a like-new Steelcase Leap V2 that looked like it was never used and paid half the price.
---
11/10 would recommend getting a real office chair for log sessions. It makes a world of difference.
---
Gotta say I prefer asian gold sellers over the company allowing such trades themselves.
---
Same here. Human just looks better imo and unless you really feel the need for stoneform or escape artist in PvP then I think it's the right choice. 
---
Personally I see stoneform as the underrated ability. Super handy against other rogues but also warriors too who will charge and bleed you to prevent restealthing.
---
Sword skill translates to dps in PvE
---
Rep gains will save you 10% of your time which is significant when grinding for hours.
---
In the end, its a game so trust your gut and play what looks the most fun.
---
Quite a few from what I see, but idk maybe I've been seeing wrong.
---
Hello :)
---
1. You can ignore it, but it will drastically slow you down. There aren’t a huge number of 30-40 level quests in other areas that would compensate. If you’re getting ganked more than the odd one here or there, it may be a good idea to hit Desolace but it will be slower. 
---
2. The best advice I can give you for launch is have a plan especially 1-20 and grit your teeth and plough through the start. It’s easy to get frustrated at the start but everyone is in the same boat. If you have a good plan you’ll clear the pack by 20.  Don’t panic and you will get ahead without wasting a ton of quest XP.
---
Bro you was the one coming at me &amp; now you’re acting all funny. 😂😂😂😂 get your bitch ass outta here smfh
---
total agree, thats crazy!
---
Still no picture?
---
SAAYAAAAVEE MEEEEEEH
---
I really, truly, do not understand the point of Formule 1. Any 18 year old can drive a car, who cares if it goes a bit quicker or slower here of there?  
---
I mean, I get what your saying, but this is how I enjoy the game. And to take your last sentence, I did find out how I like to play, so thank you :)
---
no, that's for today's stress test
---
Love the "for now" sounds soooo familiar haha.
---
Yeah 21/0/30 looks like a fun spec, would be a lot more enjoyable with raid 2 handers though :p.
---
Hopefully some guilds out there are ok to pass some over to their Pallies.
---
Some people in WoW just love to "Goose Step" on other players...
---
It is refreshing to see a streamer finally stand up to these elitest asshole tryhards that think they can tell others what is fun and what way to play their character.
---
GG Summit, just keep playing and learning the game, you will find the class you like eventually or the spec that suits your playstyle. ;)
---
BRING ME THE DATA, GOD DAMN IT!
---
You forgot Soil- Breakin me down!
---
Nah, tanking is as arms and fury is perfectly viable up till end game dungeons, you hardly notice the difference.
---
Got zeppelins though
---
Yea like I said if you wanna see who you’re talking to you either give
---
Me your @ OR your girls @ freaking troll lmfao
---
If you fall for the meme of being told what to play and you are unhappy 3 months later you, deserve it you played yourself lmao
---
From private server?
---
Yeah your pathetic lmfao
---
Shush now, child. you can tell us the truth.
---
You know guys. You can just get a decently paying job and like pay for subscription with like 1 or less hours of work. You know that like the first hour of works is usually bullshitting around anyways.

I mean I don’t have a job but I’m sure people can just do that for membership.

Being killed by a troll hunter dancing on your corpse is why you roll troll.

The hunter class quests are in the guide. 
---
Other class quests we will try to get in there, but beta testing is the priority. As soon as that’s done we will go back and start punching in extras.

---
Wow you guys are pretty bad
---
Who summit? Because he's the one crying like a bitch over some guy suggesting his plays a different spec lmao
---
Most of this shit is weak. You need to throw on South of heaven by Slayer to get that real classic pvp feel.
---
starting a game of AV in the morning, leaving to go to class, coming back, queuing up, and winding up in the same game. ahh the good ole days.
---
human is best youre Right.
---
It depends on how you want to play. If your goal is to push pve damage, human is almost a must for the wep skill, since paladins need all the help they can get.
---
Spirit is actually an okay stat for prot and ret, since you'll be working to keep your casting to a minimum for efficiency reasons anyways, you'll get some 5sec rule ticks. For holy though since you'll be spamming FoL spirit is pretty much a non-issue and you get your efficiency from Illumination.
---
The value of diplomacy really depends on your goals. If you're going to push R11+, then it doesn't matter since you'll easily hit max rep in all the pvp factions long before you reach your pvp goals. However if you don't see yourself pushing rank, and would like to hit exalted for the gear then have time to pvp on other characters, diplomacy can save you a lot of time.
---
Depending on how stealth mechanics feel on classic, perception isn't the worst racial in the world either. 
---
All that being said...stoneform is incredible, and Dwarves in plate look awesome.
---
in the stress test
---
The Lyrics are not "hasst" which means hate but "hast" which you translate to did in this context.
---
Priest will probably be prioritizing spirit first which isn't that useful to the lock anyways.  Also, it's a bit of an advantage to have same armor type while leveling because you can both prioritize quests that reward caster gear.   You won't be spending too much time in low level dungeons anyway.
---
Ah cool.
---
Do you think the class quests would slow other races down too much? 
---
People say some items are worth it, but they’re not speed runners lol.
---
I'm rolling on the Mulgore spiced bread server
---
Americana by The Offspring always makes me feel like playing FF7.
---
I dont even care what damage CS does, it'd just be great to have a button to press that actually did damage. Seals are okay (would be a lot more interesting if there were more of them/did more special stuff), but judgments doesnt even do damage by itself in vanilla... Its just poorly designed, IMO.
---
The idea of 'hybrid classes would be too strong if they had viable DPS' doesnt always apply. If the ability/passives that made you strong, were deep down in the DPS tree, then it would rule out crazy broken hybrid specs. Yes, they still have utility spells and such, but that would just be another flavour of the class, and not something that shouldve dictated their performance in any one specialized role...
---
i prefer the original ethereal voice, not the mom from family guy.
---
Contemplating rolling druid due to the versatility. I played through classic but don't remember how viable druid tanks are per-MC. If I roll with the HOTW build, will I have trouble finding groups/handling main tanking level 60 5 mans/UBRS? 
---
I know they are not as viable for raids, so my plan is to run the HOTW Spec (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxoxscrdxVgc0xo), tank per-raid content, while healing in MC/BWL.
---
Thoughts?
---
True, but i boy can still wish right?
---
Lmao so accurate.
---
I got a standing desk at work. Ask your employer to get one. Brand is Varidesk.
---
I usually sit when I have to do deep analytical work but stand for any kind of normal day to day busy work. Really helps. Then I’ll go home stretch and play classic
---
I will be resubbing JUST for classic. I will always love WoW, but I cannot stand BfA. So I wait.
---
You know world buffs are lost on death right? So if you are new to the content, don't think you are just gonna be able to put on some world buffs and clear the raid. Very few bosses in vanilla are actual gearchecks and most people will be checked on gear anyway, mechanics is what's difficult and what gets you killed, no world buffs is gonna allow you to just ignore those. World buffs are used to clear farm content faster and that's about it.
---
youll never bring 2 enhancement shamans to a serious raid, sorry to say. you put a healing shaman in melee grp and drop str+wf thats it.
---
"muh purge! muh purge!"
---
have fun killing someone with purge

---
They're not. Dunno what that shaman main is smoking.
---
Just to clarify. Someone corpse camping you regardless of level, isn't a griefer.
---
You're in the group of people who don't research before posting
---
I know what you are talking about, it’s on YouTube
---
Now Im starting to wonder how fucking ugly you are, projecting like that lol. Clearly got something serious to compensate for it seems
---
Are we going to get one of these every day?
---
Yeah I also don't understand why someone with over 7000 consistent viewers got into a beta. That's so weird.
---
also dont forget about shamans purging your shield and renew.
---
I’m tempted..
---
For human warrior I recommend you do Westfall and a Deadmines run for gear. It is slower than Darkshore but warrior is so reliant on weapons and armor that some dungeon or quest gear is going to help you overall. 
---
For nelf warrior Darkshore then go do Deadmines at 20.
---
If you have a plan and with Classic layering it shouldn’t be too heavily populated in Westfall
---
BM is good burst, but not good sustained DPS for raids. MM with a tiny tiny bit of Surv and a decent chunk of BM is much better in general.

Personal favorite of mine.
---
Reliance on fear is a bit of a crutch.  It seriously is too strong, and landing a fear pre-60 is in many cases simply a guaranteed victory.  The real power of warlock in PvP while leveling comes from healthstone, VW sac, instant dots, and eventually deathcoil.
---
You have SO much sustain as a lock that every class has to simply burn through.  I rarely lose fights post 42 because even at half health I’m only realistically down 20% of my effective health pool.  I love the class because I don’t like picking fights, but they are the king of “go ahead, try me.”
---
I was just thinking it went down from what I thought.
---
Can, if you have the skill and knowledge.
---
Not everyone does. 
---
Also, some people like the fantasy of being the tank from the outset.
---
that "agian" typo makes it sound russian lol
---
Oh you would definitely see players - but you only get to see them once and never again because they are on a different server.
---
\&gt;  they are actually on the lower end in terms of difficulty   
---
While I agree with you that they're not *that* difficult, what class would you consider to be harder to level than a Warrior? I played a Warrior/Rogue in Vanilla-Wrath, and on Pservers I've leveled 3 Warriors to 60, along with a few other classes, and my Warriors were always the most difficult overall.  
---
Warriors are great at 60, but for leveling they're pretty bottom of the barrel.   
---
* No ranged abilities
---
   * You can not mitigate incoming dmg by kiting
---
* No self heals
---
   * Requires you to stop and eat every 2-3 pulls
---
* No movement increasing abilities
---
* Limited/bad CC 
---
* Limited/bad escape mechanism (hamstring/fear + run)
---
* Heavily gear dependent
---
* Unable to handle more than 1-2 same-level mobs at a time (usually)
---
* Terribly spec dependent for wPvP encounters
---
   * Don't have TacMas while leveling? Have fun getting kited by basically everyone.
---
Not really, druids aren’t known for burst damage (or damage in general). 
---
If you want a meme spec, roll and PoM/Pyro Mage
---
troll&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
So I’ve never played a Shaman and it’s sounded super enticing for me, but unfortunately my friends want to roll Alliance. My played a lot of Priest so I’m hesitant to roll one, but what Alliance class plays most similarly to Shaman? I was really interested in the Ele/Resto PvP spec for Shaman and was hoping I could do something similar. Maybe Druid? Though I’ve heard Balance is busted...
---
Same - I grind a couple of levels because it lets you make the questing 40-50 more compact.
---
&gt; Simply put – there will not be a way to redeem TCG codes in WoW Classic.
---
Don't have a bidding war. Either setup an addon to administer secret bids or have the players whisper their RIP bids to the master looter.
---
Asmondgold made the argument we can't tell if world buffs were intended to be used for raids or not.
---
Well look at BFD, there's a shrine that give you a buff inside the dungeon. Clearly intended to be used there. Look at ZG and the ZG buff, clearly the ZG buff was made for doing ZG. 
---
If MC was designed to need +20% attack power and +20% Mana Regen, +500 health, wouldn't there be a buff right fukin outside? 
---
If the ZG buff and the flower buff and the dragon Slayer buff were meant to be used for AQ, wouldn't there be a little buff shrine outside AQ? To give some sort of boost?
---
multiple World buffs function as an easy mode option that wasn't necessary intended.
---
Use your brains
---
My plan is to roll a human paladin and, while not necessarily speed running, I want to get to cap fairly quickly.
---
My question is, how much slower is it leveling paladins than most classes? You always hear how slow they are but is it a difference between a few hours or many?
---
Just did this. I have active subscription only in my EU account and now I can hit classic play button in both EU and NA accounts. Takes me to server list with 10 servers.
---
There’s a link on my twitch page 👍
---
Lagforge is nostalgic and all, but I am actually so excited to play Vanilla again and NOT lag out in Ironforge. Networking has improved so much in the last 15 years so this will be a huge improvement.
---
Roll troll, roll alchemy for hp regen potion? Is it useful? Never played war in vanilla.
---
It could have to do with both!
---
Hahaha it should be a special section in every guide, a chapter called "prepare your family to get alone time".
---
Use Suicide Kings and stop worrying so much over loot.
---
Yes, it's not perfect but it does take away a lot of the loot drama and administration.
---
No, they literally told us that it is worth putting into consideration if the community really wants it
---
getting a warrior solo to lvl 60 is tough mate. 
---
if you have the willpower to manage it, go for it.
---
im a family father myself and with limited time of play you choose a class that is relaxing to lvl/pvp, such as rogue or mage.
---
im a big warrior fan myself but will never ever take the stress to lvl one in classic.
---
did it again on a p-server some time back, but only got to 54... it took so much time, while people on my f-list just hit 60 after 60... if you have time and a couple of friends that support you, go for it.
---
if not choose else.
---
good luck!
---
I think healing is super fun, myself.
---
Why should it be banned? If someone want to script their WoW boxing's so they can play 4 characters at once then let them, as long as they pay for 4 accounts.
---
Multiboxing for leveling is much slower than just leveling solo. XP is halved. Fetch quests take longer as you need more items to progress, etc.
---
It takes a lot commitment, can lead to a lot of frustration, and has a lot of potential for social drama. I looked from the outside at the drama of 40-man raiding guilds and felt they were not for me. Didn't really feel like I was missing out on that much, at the time. Was doing a bunch of other stuff (WPvP shenanigans) that others were missing out on as they farmed for raid stuff and professions.
---
I'm just excited to wake up on a saturday morning after a long week of work, eat some cereal, brew up some coffee, take a shower, put some pajamas on and grind some mobs and do some quests.  just the simple good life.  It will feel even better than when I was a kid cuz I had to worry about my parents, school, etc.  Now I'm in my own house with things I've earned myself and no one to answer to except my wife.  
---
my end goal is to get some decent gear and wpvp/bg but the journey is going to be the best part.  I plan to set up my speakers surround sound style (currently just use a headset) and envelop myself in the journey.
---
I might swap the faction sides but I like the Orb of Deception counters more than the order of the character creation screen :)
---
DKP and your system is communism.
---
Loot council is a liberal system where fame, commitment to the guild and time investment is the money.
---
If you think your time doesnt worth what you are rewarded you can jump to a better guild. And let your previous one die of agony because you are not there anymore to carry them.
---
It's basic supply and demand.
---
&gt;Why Lootcouncil is an inappropriate system for Classic raiding  
---
&gt;First of all your performance matters a lot less

I really appreciate such a thought-out reply! Thank you! It has kinda settled me in to going a Hunter despite a lot of posts suggesting otherwise. What sort of things does a Hunter 'bring to the table', though? Tranq shot and kiting mobs in raids? I'm speaking obviously from a place of ignorance, but it's very overwhelming starting off against all the expert knowledge people have, so thanks for giving me some info!

Farm and progression content, and character progression are all very different things and looked at differently from each other. Expectations for each are different. You can’t take a comment regarding one out of context then try to apply it to another and go “boom, I won”.
---
Here is PVE data. Play around with the drop down menus 
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/
---
There is no way yo track PVP data (no arenas) and player skill is a much bigger factor as well as the actual class match-up. You can theorycraft all you want but hysterically Rogues were the strongest in a 1v1 during 1.12 (unless fighting a Dwarf or stun gets resisted). There was a reason why Blizz specifically removed Blind from the Prep talent. Double blind was simply OP.
---
Well not really. But if someone tries to characterize me and totally misses me as a person I’d love to show him how wrong he is. Especially since the guy insists on his statement twice. That’s why I don’t wanna show EVERYONE who i really am since I have nothing to compensate.
---
I think that mechanics is what killed us during Vanilla. But now a big part of the players are used to harder mechanics + really efficient raid addons. So the main difficulty will now be on gearcheck during Classic.
---
Let's see how it goes anyway, i heard that during Vanilla there was a huge cooldown on them + debuff that prevent you to get them more than once in few days.
---
I got to 60 on a warrior as a dumb 16 year old with no clue what I was doing and I don't recall it being THAT bad
---
if you have tank/heal/dps you can farm everything so that both casters have the gear that they want… questimes are soulbound anyways… with at grp of 3 the gear is less important and at 60 the priest will go for +heal items where the wl heads for +spell dmg /+ spell hit...

until then WoW Classic whenever possible :)
---
Druid is great dungeon tank. You will never have problems finding group due class choice. Even in raids they are great OT.
---
The spec works fine for that.
---
go shaman then... same options as a paladin plus you 3 will be a fcking pain for anyone in wpvp \^\^

What's the definition of role playing, 'ey?
---
No soulshards do not
---
Loot Council sounds a lot like communism. Hard pass. Especially because I know favoritism will exist. I'd rather do some kind of attendance based system and/or performance based system to earn it.
---
Rogues are really good with minimal gear as another option, plus being able to choose your battles is super nice.
---
That being said, if those two are your choices, I'd roll hunter for the reasons u/DJHelium said
---
It causes inflation. It makes an in-game economy that regular players can’t hope to compete in - or even take part in. When farmers farm, they are using methods for the game to “generate” gold to give you, rather than exchanging gold between real people, which adds to inflation. Even if you’re not an AH goblin, that flask or whatever may now be 2-3g instead of 1g. This adds up. 
---
It also means that, if somebody actually wants to spend their free time farming some gold, they are competing against people who they can’t group with/talk to. 
---
Or, worse, they group with you in a dungeon. They don’t listen to the group, they pull what they want, etc. I want a guarantee that the people I’m grouping with are there for the same experience I am - not to silently level someone’s character thousands of miles away without caring about the test of the group. 
---
It also promotes the industry, meaning there will be MORE farmers to compete against, with exponential inflation over time.
---
Last, but far from most importantly - it diminishes cool end game items that people have to earn. The real world is stacked against so many of us as it is - let’s at least let WoW remain an even playing field.
---
I legit resubbed to check shit out, as dumb as it sounds I wanted to hold off until release but my wife has legit never played at all so I figure good time to practice controls and shit once in a life time test. I haven't started the game up in forever so my ocd was like..wait for release. The game looks so fucked now and people half my level 80 were some how beating me...my warrior had no stances no spells...tf it was like a crowded ghost town
---
As a general rule of thumb if you’re melee any class quest giving you weapons for weapon progression is going to be useful for speed running. 
---
OTOH quests that give you skills not relevant to levelling may be a waste if they don’t marry with your route. Don’t forget they do give XP though. 
---
Quest chains like Verigan’s Fist are useful despite the faffing about because the weapon is so good; the trick is to try to line it up with questing to make it efficient.
---
Don't forget digitally imported classic tranc/ classic vocal trance streams for raiding! The playlists have a lot of the same tracks they had during the late 2000s.
---
who spends dkp on shitty items in general, if the raiders are there 10/10 weeks this stuff will default to the new guys while they gain dkp, yea you arnt gonna roll in and get lokamir first drop as a newbie but why should you
---
"Leeroy Jenkins"
---
I'd be very curious to see a repeat survey of current mains 2-3 months after release. Obviously we've all been aware that warrior and mage have been some of the most popular classes in the pre-release discussion, but like others I have a hunch the warrior distribution will drop significantly after a few months.
---
You think you won’t, but you will.
---
&gt; if classic is booming 2 years from now
---
if classic is booming 2 years from now the suits will take control of it, again.
---
And trolls ;)
---
The rogues always at the top of the dps meters behind the war and ahead of the mage.  Encounter dependent of course but accurate for the most part.
---
When will the stress test servers be up ?
---
To think purge would kill someone is silly. Purge is a powerful anti-buff spell. Buffs are huge for pally’s.
---
To the raid utility - Tremor totem, enjoy BWL without that stacking in groups while directing 39 other people. Mana regen &gt; heals, WF totem &gt; rogues/wars, for salvation you can use nature’s swiftness(?) and big heal every 3 mins. Arguably same thing.
---
No Soilwork?! BAH I SAY!
---
Can you remember anything else about it?
---
yeah this was an unfortunate realization for me a few days ago.  once i saw aug 27th i went and booked the time off with my boss and now I'll be working on Tuesday gg
---
I used DKP on retail vanilla and loot council on a pserver.
---
DKP is cancer and has too many flaws and abuse it's a pain in the ass to deal with.
---
It's the duty of officer to make people understand the hierarchy between them, you have to call out who is the best dps in the raid, so that when your DFT drops, noone can contest it will go to the best dps. Of course you need to factor the gear people got from the guild or not in the equation. But it's way less commitment than a pure dkp system. Beside your guild will be better overall, because bis item wont go to retard joe who kept all his dkp for Viskag.

Do you have a 1-60 /played time you would expect people to hit using your guide? 
---
How would you say it differs from the likes of Joana's and some of the other more popular guides?
---
Nope. A different game with blocks is. Tetris.
---
Nah. The itemization gets much better with aq40 gear, but you can cobble together a solid set as early as MC as long as your guild lets you bid on off-set caster items.
---
Considering that we a sale from 2018, not understanding your point.

is this the price I have to pay or is it paid to me to even think about installing the hamster wheel on my PC?
---
in my opinion, loot council works for legendaries only.  For all other drops, DKP should be used, as folk will then bid as much or little they think an item is worth. If someone hordes their DKP, then the next folk in the raid will mop up great upgrades.  DKP means those who attend the most, earn the most DKP and in theory should be rewarded 1st.
---
Warlocks have way more survivability than mages. Have you ever fought a geared sl lock??

Why would you want to be a member of the evil faction?

Thoughts on the differences between Dwarf Priest and Paladin? Considering a pure healer.

How do people like op even survive in the world?
---
I played a hunter from Vanilla - WOTLK then played DK. Never really got to raid in Vanilla because BC came out quickly after I started. 
---
My question is, I really want to play Rogue this time around. I like melee dps class because I can be up and personal with raid bosses and PVP. Can someone who played Rogue chime in? Also considering going a healer, but ive never healed before. Pls halp.
---
are you me?
---
yea, problem is that I love healing and especially priests but I dont find them very fun to level with...   
---
I gave up on the rogue and switched to Warlock for the 2nd option because they would be fun to level but I dont know if I would like to do dungeons with them ( not a fan of being dps ).   
---
Dunno, I guess I will just try both and rotate.

Whats your plan?

---
I found one used. Often when business close or move offices they sell off all their furniture through dealers. Totally worth it
---
I levelled in vanilla as a holy paladin so I guess back then I wasn’t in a hurry!
---
It’s in the bottom third as ret and gets slower at higher levels, at least until you get to Plaguelands. 
---
As you said though it’s about how much slower - about 15% slower than the fastest classes. Don’t forget you get your class mount for free at 40 which is an advantage. 
---
Try doing dungeons/ dungeon quests as you go with a decent group for gear upgrades to help level. 
---
Have a weapon progression plan 👍
---
I love healing, so much so, than my main from release to Cata was a hunter. My fav alt was a resto shammy. So this time I'm making the resto shammy my main.
---
What happens when guild drama spills over at work?
---
What a weird post to explain how people should be playing Classic, out of all games.
---
They ruin the economy and also give people who buy gold an unfair advantage. 
---
Someone who bought gold has probably more of it and therefore is willing to pay higher prices resulting in higher prices on the AH making it in return for people with less gold harder to afford items, trade good etc.
---
Meh I took my 4 weeks already and have 20 sick days to use
---
Someone has to.
---
Loot council is purely attendance and performance based, it's what makes it such a crappy system. The good players get all the gear and the bad ones get nothing.
---
Stoneform if you are pvping
---
lmfao u sound like a revolting neckbeard, maybe take a shower and try and get some of that bacon grease out of your system
---
1 month of Classic with a lot of things to do versus few weeks of boredom in BFA. Same price, make your choice.
---
No no no no. The old ones are SO much better and the elves and the undead ACTUALLY look like they're supposed to.
---
I mean...he's not wrong.
---
ah you mean the pala spell
---
you in the group of people who think i care, why research when i can have you angry neck beards tell me
---
Seriously naxx is 2 years worth of content. Plenty of time to ponder.
---
Oh wow I remember that. It would be a funny time to see MC as hard again though.
---
That's not a problem, since fury warriors are what guilds will have most of. He'll get invited without any issues even if he refuses to tank anything.
---
Sad, but true.
---
i\`m finding it pretty hard to believe the alliance/horde ratio is so balanced
---
I think Pyromancer Loregrain and he drops the first weapon recipe
---
I dont like the cartoony style we have now. The old onces look brutal.
---
Imo, this is just as bad of a post as the no lifers posting about bis gear and specs. Just let people play how they want.
---
Name checks out

Yes, no need to research, might not get a chance at all this juicy karma!

People tell me the same about almost any class :thinking:

As much as I can but there is an awful lot of tedium there

what
---
&gt;for salvation you can use nature’s swiftness(?) and big heal every 3 mins. Arguably same thing.
---
In what universe is [Nature's Swiftness](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=16188) "arguably the same thing" as [Blessing of Salvation](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25895)?
---
I'm just going to assume you're trolling with how ridiculously wrong your post is.
---
depends which class you Play i guess.
---
from my experience a frost mage is harder to kill than a warlock
---
It will be a bit too powerful in phase 2 when the only way to rank will be outdoor PvP. So people will power level a 60 then power lvl alts in phase 1. Get a bunch of low lvl warlocks set up all over the map and nobody else will be able to compete. 
---
It's not just "a unique and fun way to play" it will actually be much better for PvP in phase two.
---
Don't join a loot council guild. Solved.
---
Fury or Arms is better for tanking than prot while levelling. It's only at level 60 you should consider changing to prot, and even there it's questionable if you should do it unless you're tanking raid bosses.
---
I will play a melee hunter, if a guild will let me dps
---
Powerman 5000
---
You have a point. Rare items are indeed hard to acquire in a LC guild and usually go to the class leader.
---
Found the human priest
---
rats!! im missing out on all my fake internet points that do nothing!
---
The fuck you mean locks are not so good in pvp? They’re one of the best 1v1 classes with sl build and have crazy burst with ruin.
---
Design decisions like this, is why *I personally* wanted more of a "remaster", than a vanilla clone. So much of it was just designer inexperience, or technological limitations. Classes and specs were designed without things like the debuff limit in mind, so a lot of them just ended up being obsolete, or hamstrung - not because they wouldnt be good enough, but because there were more important debuffs that would take priority.
---
Small things like that are what I wouldve liked to see improved upon, but I understand why the uber-hardcores dont want any changes. Im excited for Classic, but not for gameplay reasons. Ive so far been unable to find a class/spec that I really enjoy (as the gameplay is just so rough, even compared to the late TBC/early Wrath when I started playing). But the simplicity of the game, and the sense of adventure and community, is why Im so excited to get into it for real. Though from a *personal* level, I think it couldve greatly benefited from some improvements/refinements.
---
Be dwarf.
---
Thats not really how effectivd councils work, you dont just pull up recount and sort the loot to the highest numbers.
---
Na then it would go to the scrub who is still using thrash blade because he never bothered to farm his real pre-bis and doesn't show up to optional Ony raids to get Viskag. In reality it all gets taken into account but something like CTS will last you all game until the end of naxx so it should go to one of your best players even if they already have an MC/Ony weapon.
---
If you suck. You shouldn’t be dying in the starter zone as any class on any pserver.
---
But it's chill to seat and eat :)
---
Do they, though?
---
Please call me if you make a guild in the horde :D !
---
i am not gonna point out your contradictions in detail but short:
---
you think loot in classic doesnt matter cause its so easy so you are afraid to not get loot.
---
furthermore you think attendence is the most important part but think you cant influence the lootcouncil by showing attendence?
---
Your statement would be correct 2 months ago.
---

---
Darude - Sandstorm ?
---
I would have liked the old models with the upright posture for the orcs :P
---
Awesome, thank you! Can't wait to watch your speedrun!
---
Fair enough, depends on the job too. I work for a police service and I'd feel like shit if I called in sick when I wasn't, I know the shit show it is when an officer doesn't show up and you're short staffed.
---
I'd tell them like a week in advance some bullshit about needing some days off for medical reasons or something and have them use my sick days lol
---
Doesnt change the fact that people sell mythic runs when its current
---
&gt; MMOs and gaming in general recently have a huge problem with community perception. Some well-known person says X should be done one way or Y is trash and that notion spreads like wildfire throughout the community.
---
This shit absolutely killed dota for me, and it killed Overwatch for me as well. For a good while games were very silly, with maybe every few game there would be one tryhard Invoker in mid, but very soon "the meta" crept in to everyone's mind, and there came only one way to play. Stepping away from that way not only got your teammates yelling at you, but if the enemy team went full bore into the meta in an *Unranked* game it really would be genuinely you and your friends' faults for having the game lost because you wanted to rock some janky gank tri lane with bursty supports.  
---
Then in Overwatch you get people yelling at you for playing your favorite character in *Unranked* because "they have X and X counters your character so switch".  
---
I know there will always be really dedicated progression guilds and those guilds shouldn't take the Dwarf Survival hunter with Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian because "he's so close to finishing the set" through MC, but I really hope there will be more casual raiding guilds in Vanilla that don't crumple instantly from drama due to guild leaders who feel they could totally make it in the Progression guilds if only they would notice him.
---
* complains about people telling others how to play the game
---
* in a post telling other how to play the game
---
You haven’t fought a good warlock then lol
---
Roll girl toon. Say mic broken for months in discord. Be flirty but not overly slutty. Wait til loot council is formed. "Open up" to one of loot council people with some made up story that is a lil depressing. End conversation with how comfortable you are with them. (Do this with a couple of the lootcouncil members).  Show up regularly and do decent. Any time you're going to miss let em know your grandmother who you are extremely close with is ill. Make known the item you really want casually. Send fake nudes (that cannot be reverse searched) to your lootcouncil "friend". 4 days before raid with said item you want grandma "dies". Dont play night before raid for pretend funeral. Say you're unsure if you'll raid or not. Raid obviously. Say how its a nice distraction and you love the guild family you have. Item drops profit. Item doesn't drop next week have grandma's will drama. This can go on a while. When the item drops you'll get it. Lootcouncil is not corrupt btw.
---
You are a perfect example of the type of person who only focuses on the negatives.  what a sad way to live life.  
---
\&gt; Ah, you are one of those people who project all their own insecurities on to mythical "liberals". It's the "liberals" who are oversensitive, entitled, whiny, selfish, emotional thinkers with a massive victim mentality. Yup. "Liberals". Definitely *not*you. 
---
i'm not the one being oversensitive, entitled, whiny, or selfish regarding this matter.  the people who want the game changed because they don't like how others play it are the oversensitive entitled ones.  
---
\&gt; "...and then used that stronger character to sealclub levellers", yes.   
---
I also use that Stronger character to kill twinks that are on the enemy team.  
---
\&gt; Just as you would be a bully if you used the resources available to everyone in the real world to get big muscles and learn boxing and then beat up smaller people for fun.   
---
playing a video game in the way to get as most advantage as possible to beat people in a competition (PvP Battleground)  isn't the same as physically abusing people in real life for no reason.  
---
you arguments hold no ground whatsoever,  actually laughing so hard right now
---
NA &amp; oceanic, not all. just got it confirmed by Blizzard.
---
Rule Nr. 1: Don't play WoW with your coworkers.
---
Rule Nr. 2: If you play WoW with your coworkers, stop it.
---
If you are friends on Battle.net and work together at the same time, it can quickly happen that one employee watches over the other. Small in-game disputes become bigger problems in the workplace. Just don't do it, I had to learn it the hard way.
---
You really only need 17 points in the prot tree to tank anything in the game. That gives you the extra shield block charge, last stand, and 5/5 defiance. You can easily take those at the end of your leveling journey. Its better to start with a deep wounds style tanking build so you've got the extra leveling dps.
---
Am I the only one who is laughing about your joke? Lol
---
It wouldn't really feel like vanilla then.
---
Still unconfirmed in beta. Waiting on a few people to get the right gearing, time, etc to test thoroughly. I'd assume so tho.
---
20% int from HotW is arguably better for a fresh 60 with blues in MC. Once you gear up a bit, Moonglow and full Resto specs become more useful.
---
&gt; This is not a whine that i cba leveling or anything, it just feels so demoralising to know that all that progress will be lost. 
---
This always strikes me as odd, although I realize it's a beta and I will be starting over in August, I always felt that just playing the game is fun in all aspects, and that includes leveling. Before I got into beta, I spent the last month leveling up in pserver up to 54. And now that my lvl 40 is nearly BiS, I'm leveling another toon. 
---
I think people tend to forget or generally dislike that Classic has a large portion of content dedicated to leveling and even on release, it was 80% of the content. The end-game stuff was rolled out later and at some point it became all the game was know for. This is what ruined the current wow for me, it's like everyone forgot about the awesome journey that leveling is. 
---
If leveling isn't for you, then perhaps you'd be happy with BFA or some other game where the focus is 95% eng-game and just queuing up for activities one after the other.
---
I'm seeing the same thing. They changes a bunch of things:
---
1. Beta: World of Warcraft Classic still shows up under 'In Development'
---
2. WoW Battle for Azeroth is now simply 'World of Warcraft' under Live - when you pick that, it lets you select an account.
---
3. It gave me an option to install WoW Classic which is now its own standalone option under Live. Of course, when I click play, I see the same screen.
---
Noe sure what's going on but looks like some heavy server side changes in preparation for an open beta perhaps?
---
Some of the models look good, but in most cases I dislike the new spell and character animations personally. 
---
I'd be fine with a toggle existing for people who want them, but if the new models/animations were mandatory I'd probably not play.
---
Yeh, I wish they went with a at least graphically updated version. A lot of the models were already shit ten years ago.
---
Rogues are super fun. 
---
1. You get to gank enemies in World PvP
---
2. You get to stealth around mobs and pick fights. Also pickpocketing is super cool!
---
3. Excellent DPS in PvE
---
Downsides are not great at soloing elites or multiple mobs. Can be squishy in BG battles, but you're still great at killing clothies.
---
Paladin is an amazing PvP healer, while priest is the Goat for PVE. Both very good options.
---
Lol ''some guy'' x100. Really are you him streaming 12 hours a day listening to a bunch of ''I'm so good wait till i get beta and rek you'' players. Seriously I'm not the biggest fan of summit and I concur he's not the best WoW player, but why the fuck does he need to be? Go watch Monkeynews or Perp if you want to see the best. 
---
I can COMPLETELY understand that after 12 hours of streaming and having a bunch of people bitching and whining of his specs that he gets upset. And then people like you say he's ''crying like a bitch over one guy''. Okay.
---
While raid boosts were probably less seen back then (at least in early vanilla it wasn't common), all kinds of stuff were spammed back then. Does it really matter what the spammers say?
---
That's just how channels are. Personally I won't be joining The Barrens chat, simply because I don't fancy a shitton of people trying too hard to "bring it back". It was fun back then, but trying to replicate it with Chuck Norris jokes that haven't been fun for over a decade isn't my cup of tea. So just ignore it or leave the channel and play, then it won't really affect you, will it?
---
Cheers mate
---
Blowing and memes guaranteed with Oomkin, untill oom that is. He is a funny video of 3 boomkins spamming moonfa in a bg. 
---
[https://youtu.be/-1MS77G83uQ](https://youtu.be/-1MS77G83uQ)
---
Other then that, druid pvp is hella grindy, you can kill multiple people solo in small skirmshes in world pvp, but only by running away and jumping back in tactics. Travel form is pretty busted
---
All I know is that BfA has an option to make Orcs stand up-straight instead of their natural hunch, keep that as far away from classic as possible.
---
A toggle for that would be absolutely amazing. 10/10
---
29-11-11
---
Balance damage output, feral charge and insect swarm. open as cat with pounce and rake, go caster, dot up, go bear charge + stun them, run away, repeat. Fun as heck.
---
If you are interested in Ele/resto for pvp, I dont think you will find any similarities on alliance side (sadly)
---
I’m thinking of going full retard and playing a hunter. I’ve already tanked and healed in vanilla and I’ll be semi-casual so when they suck after BWL I won’t care. By then I’ll just be Viper Stinging priests in PvP
---
It does say that some version of Tetris has been downloaded by paying users over 400 million times though, but I guess it's hard to get an official number
---
Why the hell is asmongold always on the thumbnails...?
---
Nice! We have a guy with "Zug Zug" on one car and "Loktar" on the other at my office.
---
Seems I've had a misunderstanding. Thanks for the information fella.
---
No lol. 2 raid nights are enough.
---
Dwarf Priest has Fear Ward which is the most valuable racial for raids and dungeons.
---
Priest can heal with hots and prevent incoming damage with shields. Priest is imo the overall better Healing class for dungeons and raids and pvp.
---
Paladins can only cast, except holy shock. But they are equally good solo target healers and shine with their blessings (freedom for melees, protection for casters). They are more tanky and have that awesome bubble.
---
Its a tough decision but personally, if you want to heal, i would go with the dwarf priest.
---
I’d say about 5 or 6 days /played if you practise a bit and aren’t going to distract yourself with professions or wandering off to pvp etc. 
---
Joana has an excellent Horde side guide and recently started working on an Alliance side guide but it’s not complete or tested. 
---
Brian Kopp’s guide (the one used in Vanilla Guide) is the best free guide but it has a lot of inefficiencies and some of it is wrong as it was changed for TBC values
---
There is a guide based on Varrak’s speedrun but it won’t work on Classic as his speedrun is built on pserver values and behaviour including TBC quest XP, so if you use it you’re likely to have some issues keeping aligned with questing. Also no sure if Varrak actually endorsed anyone copying his route, so I’m a bit funny about that.
---
I'd say, people will only start to appreciate world buffs \~12 months down the line when AQ releases. Suddenly there is SO MUCH to do every evening, getting MC and BWL done in a fun and quick way becomes really appealing.
---
But yeah world buffs really should be disabled for current content.
---
Thankfully stupid ass opinions like this dies fast
---
I have a simple build I do where a T2 rogue (who should easily be able to kill a priest, cannot). I can show you my vanilla build as disc priest but only being able to comment every 8 mins is ticking me off. With the build: It does require a 10k mana pool with decent mana regen and patience to slowly tick away health with dots, fear, shield, heal yourself over and over again while they beat on you - in the end you will win but you have to be good, because they will most likely be skilled rogues you find in the wild (rogues are notorious gankers and think priests are easy targets). The other guy responding to you is salty AF for some reason and most likely an ally deadbeat - I told him in my original comment what I meant by what I said. Also, I’m actually a warrior main in retail kek.
---
Second that, remember learning the world had around 4 billions humans in school. Now we are soon at 8?
---
Salvation
---
Tons of people will play rogues, but, since they and warriors are great sustained DPS, raids may take as many as 6 rogues so you should be able to raid as long as you’re a good rogue. For PvP they’re amazing. The amount of stun and interrupts you have make you a terror for casters. 
---
For PvE I suggest combat swords. For PvP daggers gives better burst.
---
Stormwind  used to be the place where only stinky casuals hung out.
---
What are dungeon tier sets? Are they like the best gear to get before raiding at 60?
---
Truth
---
Haha I just saw this scene!
---
Buy a Nightfall and most guilds will let you melee raids.
---
From the dawn of time we came; moving silently down through the centuries, living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering; when the few who remain will battle to the last. No one has ever known we were among you... until now.
---
Good for you!  Now stop trying to whore out your personal experience as a "guide."
---
Hunter will always be top tier if played properly
---
* the crit talent is nice early on, but becomes less important later. Repenteance is stronger in PVP. If I had to choose, I'd go with repentance.
---
* Blacksmithing is a profession, which requires dedication. Don't bother with it, if you plan on switching to something else. Also don't bother with arcanite reaper/champion. Those weapons aren't that good for a paladin, especially a human. Malowns Slam from strat is better. 
---
* You can't craft Sulfuras, you can only craft the Sulfuron Hammer, which is then combined with a bop drop from Ragnaros to make Sulfuras. Again, if you plan to do that, you must stick with blacksmithing. The plan requires a rare drop from Golemagg and if you switch professions, any plans are lost. You will never get that plan, if you don't stick with blacksmithing. But Sulfuras doesn't require you to be able to forge the sulfuron hammer. This item is not bop.
---
* non plate gear remains bis for healers for a majority of the game. Only the T3 set is full on healer focused. If you look at [itemization.info](https://itemization.info/?search=has%3Ahealing+subtype%3Aplate+phase%3A1), the only plate items with +healing available in phase 1 is the T1 set and two smithing items, the plans of which are rare drops from raid bosses. In phase 2 a pair of boots, a belt and wristguards are added. So, you see, if you want to be a plate healer, you only have the T1 set as an option early on, which is great for pvp, but inferior to other items in pve, but as you want to play casual, this is likely an acceptable compromise. If you include mail, you can get a couple more pretty nice pre raid pieces from scholomance.
---
Nah, I don’t remember the name or anything.
---
Might've confused with Healthstones
---
Can already see one guys stand up and yell "WHO THE FUCK IS OOGA ? STOP GANKING ME"
---
About 10+ post about this yesterday
---
Won t really matter then. Go something mobile. Mage can take people off mounts with poly
---
Loot in classic has minimal impact on the performance of your raidgroup but it has lots of impact on personal satisfaction.
---
Attendance is the most important part. A loot council might consider it a factor but you dont know how weighted that factor is, it can differ from councilmember and they can change it without telling you.
---
Rolling Dwarf Prot Paladin. Don't talk shit please. I only want to hear positive feedback from players who have played vanilla Prot paladin. I understand the limitations already, but would like to hear helpful advice such as:
---
Int or Str focus?
---
Different talent builds?
---
Threat gaining tactics?
---
Could try druid... feral to level where you have the sneaky rogue like play but at 60 you can switch to healing for raids/5 mans.
---
Remind me! 68 days
---
Like some already stated. If you are considering RET PVE human is a must. 
---
Otherwise Dwarf stoneform is the most broken racial for PVP including Will of the Forsaken.
---
I agree to an extent. Having the updated models in the graphics of the classic world would just look silly. A slight update to the models so that you can actually see their facial features and limbs that aren't made of triangles would be great
---
i totally agree more polished characters don't do the game any harm i mean you can make it optional like the "classic graphics option" so everyone can pick whatever he/she prefers
---
&gt; If you go a while without respeccing, the cost starts to come back down.
---
Really? What'S the timer? I can't remember this being the case.
---
Worst/best part is the sheer amount of random PMs "hey wanna come heal X?" 
---
Warriors have it even better/worse
---
Oh my bad. I’ll delete it. Didn’t see anything yet
---
Some people enjoy speedrunning, what don't you understand in that? Also, some people want to get ahead of the pack and not get stuck in the thousands of people that will be in the starter areas, if you achieve this, than you will continue to be ahead of everyone, meaning you'll have a much easier time leveling. Not everything is about taking your time and enjoying the game, people who go fast also enjoy the game, just another way.
---
I'm getting tired of reading posts like these. Classic is just going to be classic. They are changing the game as little as possible.
---
Multiboxing PvP is great in theory but rarely works in execution outside mass mob scenarios like you describe and those are rare in themselves.
---
If someone wants to level 10 Warlocks to 60 in Classic (lol months of work) and pay $200CAD a month to play them all and have the skill/hardware to pull it off effectively I'll just laugh and enjoy the show.
---
Most multiboxers will be two characters and they won't be heavily experienced. It's not hard to fight against one person controlling two characters. Both toons are being played optimally and you can capitalize on that opportunity.
---
my guild used loot council and no one complained because we were all selfless and wanted the guild to do well, which we did. dkp is a terrible system. a MT on my vanilla server had enough DKP to buy hand of rag, so they let him, and they lost their MT and then failed miserably trying to progress deep into BWL because they had to have their OT become a MT and he didn't have great gear
---
i still don't know what BiS means we always called it BoE and BoP
---
This guy catfishes
---
Jesus
---
GIVE US RP PVP!
---
Was it on a pvp server or pve?
---
No, what they said was they wouldn't touch the vanilla database, that means there's 0% chance for new content, however what they also said that depending on the success of classic we may see options for future expansions as classic options as well.
---
I'll play both, I really enjoy retail wow raids. They are very challenging and exciting. But when I get to 60 and raid on classic I'll most likely play retail less
---
Put a toggle for it. Everyone will be happy.
---
i have "Beta. World of Warcraft classic" on my browser but doesnt mention stress test, but its greyed out, im confused? do i not have beta as it doesnt mention stress test.
---
Yeah, the only thing is solo ability for elites. I leveled a rogue up to 25 on a server that will not be named, and I can surely say if you don’t have evasion up and you pull two mobs, you fucked. Single target grinding seems very efficient though.
---
Some people like blood sausage.  People are morons.
---
Their best album in my opinion. Bat country slaps.
---
&gt; BOTH are much easier to attain as Protection Warrior. 
---
Imo it's easier to hold aggro as fury, and easier to gain initial aggro as arms (due to anger management). And survivability has in my experience not been an issue in dungeons.
---
We don’t plan on loot counciling anything but Legendarys and mounts. Unless your guild is doing split runs there is no point in gear funneling. No need to rush to the end. Classic isn’t going anywhere.
---
Exactly what I'm saying.
---
Low effort memes... smh mods. All memes are low effort. /facepalm
---
I hope not, we don't need the thought police running around making everyone miserable.
---
That's what she said
---
From what I've seen posted I'm expecting a lot more priests. Definitely not second to last
---
Absolutely fucking not.
---
I just got invited to beta and can download the game, but I can't start the game with the launcher - haven't tried yet with the .exe in the folder, because I was short and had to go, but a friend of mine reported the same problem to me - any advices?
---
Pvp of course, it did take me a very long time though, not sure about /played but about 3 months
---
I’m streaming regularly on Classic Beta practising for launch 👍 You can also look for Leshraque who is also streaming
---
Not sure if sarcastic, but gnome locks were a thing
---
I've been making a play list all week. These three are in it for sure. I also have Trapt and tenacious D lol
---
Shots fired!
---
I mean, take one minute to read the trees and you'll see why :p
---
Sonic Syndicate! Thanks Drake Dog!
---
shamans have such a unique toolkit that you cant compare it to any other class. sucks that your friend will go alliance in this case.
---
druids have the versatility of the shaman class plus they have the tank specc aswell.
---
with a good mix of balance/heal you can solo pvp aswell but for leveling you will go feral.
---
99.9% of old school PVP videos started with some soft music to introduce the character and transitioned to heavy rock once the actual face melting began.
---
Druids don’t have a real blow up spec. Your best option is to go the classic 30/0/21 spec. Something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tcx0MEohZVE0oso
---
Honestly you could even drop NS and just get Moonkin for the ultimate meme spec.
---
I see a raid team as a multi armed beast and therefore the best swapping out of shitty item for good item makes the beast strongest. Loot council is the best method of arming the beast most efficiently but I admit it's not for everyone.
---
On my Horde toon I'm gonna play undead rogue and gank alliance all day.  On my Alliance toon I'm gonna play Dwarf paladin since only alliance can be paladin's in classic and I main a paladin in retail.
---
It's not tanky, true. But it's still a very useful extra dps which combined with 2 dots allows you to forget about the first mob then go straight into the next. It's like a little perm wanding bot. Warlock kit pre-10 is just better than most others. I think the only other class that competes is priest and that's only once they get their enchanting wand.
---
it is classic wow after all... slow Gameplay in pve \^\^
---
The problem here is that while vanilla had spell batching, not all spells were on the same spell batch window. Some spells needed to be properly coded so they could go off instantly without being batched, an example of which being interrupts. Kevin Jordan, a class designer for vanilla wow, talks about it in the last classicast which is definitely worth watching.
---
Cx am i right? 😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
Atleast fix the models, not just characters, and clean them up so they don’t look like polygons, y’know?
---
I am going to make an orc warrior, or human (maybe gnome) mage if my group of friends is going alliance. 
---
Then I am going to level that. 
---
End of plans.
---
What is so hard to understand about everyone that has a sub gets into the stress test.
---
The class leader is class leader for a reason though. If that reason solely comes down to "is RL buddies with guild master", I mean it's your own fault for joining that guild. It's not a loot system issue at all.
---
This is the funniest thing I have ever seen!  It's funny because it's true!
---
Only noobs would call in sick / plan a vacation the first couple days during the launch. Will be plagued with connection issues ( like usual ) and will be very over crowded
---
We regularly raided IF and killed everyone during Wrath. 
---
Stormwind was a bitch though.
---
Its not gender of the player does not change the fact that there is a player. 
---
This image is counting players, not counting Male/Female players. So its irrelevant but accurate.
---
&gt; * You can not mitigate incoming dmg by kiting
---
You can hamstring kite to trade 1:1 attack with mobs regardless of their attack speed, but might not work on classic because of melee range while moving
---
&gt; * No self heals &gt; requires you to stop and eat every 2-3 pulls
---
Spirit regen + bandages go a long way, there isn't much downtime
---
&gt; * No movement increasing abilities
---
More or less
---
&gt; * Limited/bad CC
---
Intimidating shout can be really good, but more or less right
---
&gt; * Limited/bad escape mechanism 
---
Piercing howl is a godsend
---
&gt; * Heavily gear dependent
---
Gotta plan your route and weapon upgrade path, usually the level or two before you get your next weapon are pretty painful yup
---
&gt; Unable to handle more than 1-2 same-level mobs at a time (usually)
---
Every other pull you can sweeping strikes + cleave 2 mobs 
---
&gt; Terribly spec dependent for wPvP encounters
---
Fury up to 30 then arms up to 60, but you'll still get shit on by mages/warlocks/priests most likely
---
It's normally not an issue. Once BGs come out and there's a cap on how many players for each side they actually become a negative on your team. My problem is not 10 warlocks that are all 60. My problems is 10 warlocks that are all lvl 20.
---
No no no he needs that rage cost reduction early. It helps so much trust me.
---
&gt; Why avoid a streamer? **Watch this video.**
---
They weren't ret-conned to be space goats yet.
---
They were literally an april fool's joke and then there was an xpac added around them to sell the game to little kids.
---
&gt; I am in my 30's and watching people play games I can already play seems silly to me. I did finally start watching WoW classic streamers as I don't have access to the game.
---
/co-sign
---
I grew up with 2 brothers so watching someone else play was always something I had to do and I hated it. I'd much rather play the game than watch someone else play it.
---
Solo I like the succubus, casters are already pretty easy matchups.
---
Group pvp I prefer the felhunter, a key CS or dispel can turn a fight.
---
Occasionally I'll use the imp. He actually does decent damage, particularly if you have The Black Book, and nobody wants to spend the time to go and kill him. Nice for more casual pvp where you want to preserve shards.
---
God PLEASE add markers to the podcast.
---
i wish i would put in as much efford in my actual life than you do making shit up.
---
probably easier to make your own raid and be lootcouncil
---
Or just be a girl irl
---
 Come, I have *such fascinating things to show you*!
---
where the wls mobility? sl locks are boring after all. feel free to Play wl mate
---
username checks out
---
Wait are just people based in the US getting in this time? I'm EU and I've been in the previous two stress tests but it still says ''You can't play World of Warcraft Classic yet.''
---
Have you ever found yourself being overwhelmed by the amount of spells they have ? That’s my 1 slight question. 
---
Also is enhance or ele the more preferred way to level up?
---
Implying wow never had a cartoony style before
---
Oh please do
---
I just like humans a lot, which I know is kind of boring. I was planning to make a mage first (My old burning crusades main was a mage, though I played horde back then). But I'd also like to dabble with a priest I think.
---
 I know mechanically speaking that Dwarves are the best priests at end game, because fear ward is amazing, but human priests are still good right? My understanding is that spirit is actually useful for holy priests even if it was not a great stat for most races, and humans do get that +5% spirit.
---
You’re full of shit if you raided with 72 people and no lag. I had a really solid gaming PC. I still lagged.
---
&gt; Wiping on a boss because the server couldn't process your action fast enough
---
That's not what batching is at all, but thanks for trying.
---
I'll transfer that shit if it happens to me
---
I’m playing alliance, will be leveling w my brother who is a hunter. Never played a caster DPS class before and torn between mage and warlock. I dabble in pvp but mostly focus on questing/dungeons/raids
---
Mage pros: farming ability, mobility, killer dps at endgame, interesting kit, I love the cc and different schools of magic, utility w conjure food/water and ports
---
Mage cons:
---
- everyone and their mother plays one, possible oversaturation, wears dresses
---
Warlock pros:
---
- pet, utility w soulstones, healthstones, summons, reliable dps at endgame, always needed in raids, slightly cooler dresses than mages w robe of the void
---
Warlock cons: hamstrung by debuff limit, will have to port everyone always, lock is slightly weaker on alliance
---
He changed a while back - for the better I think - he got really tired of playing games he hated (PUBG, Fortnite) that people wanted him to play just for the sake of being popular on Twitch. You could see on his streams how angry and frustrated he was all the time.
---
Now he's playing with a mindset that if his viewers don't like it, he doesn't care. I think in this video his rant is as much towards the viewers as much as it is a reinforcement to himself that he should never go back to playing for how other people want him to play.
---
It's all fun until you're doing things soullessly.
---
ive fought many good wls mate
---
just as i said i dont see the mobility that i would like to have in pvp, it is personal favore after all
---
it's really scary
---
i try to stop myself from playing too much
---
The scarcity of gear is why loot council is a great system. Give the dedicated mage who always brings consumables the first T2 set. The TF bindings go to the MT. 
---
Yeah. It sucks for people like me. My odd work hours mean I will be raiding 2 weeks a month. I will never get Nefarians trinket, or a great weapon.
---
Any boomking spec is a meme spec. But if you really want to have fun try feral in resto gear or resto in feral gear. It really pushes the boundaries.
---
Depends on the system. 
---
In 5e, a dex fighter can give a rogue a run for their money.
---
Never said they had mobility or that they were fun to play nor are we talking about that. You said they weren’t so good in pvp when it’s actually the opposite.
---
I spent about a month looking at chairs but really didn't want to buy online because I hate returning stuff I don't like.  Ended up spending 350 on a chair from office Depot that was okay but not as great as my old chair that got worn down.  The gaming chair they had there was way too firm to me and I didn't go with Herman Miller because I don't see how a mesh back could beat a back with cushion.  I know I'm probably wrong on it but seemed like I'd be paying for hype of that chair.  I should've took the risk.
---
Not enough servers
---
I was considering a rogue for my PvP server character but with so many Warriors I might consider a Lock or Mage instead.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Trading card game, some special cards had scratch off codes you could redeem for in game vanity items and mount.
---
Those aren't too bad, at least there's a clear and obvious answer: yes, it's stupid. 
---
Worse are all the threads arguing about how "viable" feral druids and stuff are.
---
I'll check it out!
---
Probably not though. Sl locks counter mages.
---
I do it with two computers that cost about 7 grand all together. The average $1000 gaming computer could probably handle 10 copies of retail wow on shit settings if you just put more ram in it and classic is significantly easier to run than that.
---
I played Laughing Skull - US on launch.  The most well known guild on the server wasn't my guild or the other top ones who killed Ragnaros before most people even hit 60.  It was a handful of middling raiders who loved to dick around called PALS FOR LIFE.
---
enhancement is Pretty simple for leveling and pvp at 60.
---
ele Needs some better Training, they have a large toolkit that you Need to use.
---
enhancement is the way to go but look up a decent guide on the webs, there are many YouTube Videos for your Questions :)
---
don't forget to install Unregistered Hypercam
---
Yikes
---
&gt;the people who primarily wanted Classic are those who spent way too much time playing in '05
---
Like those folks are the minmaxers now. Majority of these people is in their 30s or past that now, they don't have the time to minmax-raid. The minmaxers are more likely the people who grew up with later iterations of WoW, where speedleveling and minmaxing were normal. They learned that mentality AND have time to actually do it.
---
As much as I have waited for classic, I probably won't be around at launch (because I got stuff to do) and then take on a slow journey, enjoying every breath of it.
---
Now I'm not representative of everyone else, but I do think my rationalization makes sense. I can't believe that the retail-instant-gratification-haters that advocate how great the journey was and how shitty themeparks are etc will be the ones minmaxing and speeding through the content to the point where they'll be done with all the classic content in a year.
---
I mean look at it from streamers perspective, they are constantly spammed with stupid comments telling them how to play the game, when probably over 90% of the chat are wrong in many things and just regurgitate what they have read on the forums.
---
That last sentence! P.S. did u know that druid tanks have the best threat, also, have more armour than warriors and the largest mana pool for decursing? Plus can heal and tank in one spec, letting that fury warrior go dps instead...but ye druid is bad, dont play it:)
---
Wow that's some serious dedication LOL
---
&gt; [People are talking about parses and logs ... like this is retail, where ... there's nothing else to the game.](https://i.imgur.com/DWrI2JY.mp4)
---
If you want to get in to more stuff get stuff in your kit to make you needed or have reasons to bring you if you have engineering learn the  [Field Repair Bot] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18232/field-repair-bot-74a) or [Annihilator] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12798/annihilator) and [Nightfall] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall#comments)
---
Sadly indeed... may be easier to convince my friends to go Horde than it is to pick an Alliance class for me. Thanks!
---
Nah I bet they have bigger d\*cks
---
&gt;The only difference a higher level makes is you're less likely to be spotted by mobs while in stealth.
---
The point of being a higher level to farm gold isn't to stealth around and pickpocket.  The point is you can straight up farm mobs that drop gray items which vendor for a gold each or so.  You can make much more just killing random mobs at level 60 than you can ever get pickpocketing mobs in SM.
---
this really can't be answered. Nowadays, it'S known exactly what materials are required, so if a server has enough dedicated guilds on both side,s it'S entirely possible, the war effort finishes within a day. If there was a server, where only people, woh never palyed WoW before and who didn't check what was needed, it would take much longer, up to 12 weeks.
---
Vanilla WoW is not about raiding, for OP.
---
For me its gonna be all about raiding, even if I have to raid in 2 different guilds at the same time to keep myself entertained.
---
so what you want to discuss now? my opinion is that wl is not so good for pvp for reasons that i wrote. you just say they are good because of the sl specc. pvp is not just 1v1 duel situations though. 
---
i would choose a mage in my grp over a wl for pvp because of the heavy cc they bring, the mobility and the survivability.
---
if (missing_modern_feature)  
---
    add_it()  
---
This is how I assume these people think programming looks like. Imagine thinking bringing 15 year old code to today's standard is easier than altering and stripping features from already modern code. Hell, I have issues working with 1-2 year old code from my colleagues sometimes.
---
You're heading of the post makes it seem that you are not open for discussion rather one sided on the topic.
---
It seems like the argument against loot council is the misuse by those in control of the guild. DKP has a misuse amongst those that don't understand their class itemization or the importance of an item going to someone els instead of theme They both have pros and cons.  Join what you prefer. I'd only go for DKP if there was some veto power or in a large guild.
---
Why they should respec? Not everyone playing pvp tho, most tanks will stay in prot for the whole vanilla
---
dkp is fine and fair 
---
its not fair a newcomer get his equip on first raid day
---
I’m convinced this subreddit has a thing for warlocks. I don’t ever recall there being an abundance of locks during vanilla or any point in the games history.  After all the Sample size for this survey is only 20k some people so I’m sure lock populations will thin down come release.  Of course I should add that I will be one of said warlocks.
---
Just want to point out that Indestructible by Disturbed came out in 2008, a few months before Wrath released. So it's more of a full BC experience. XD
---
Lol classic will be all the rage for 3 months. Pass.
---
I grew up with an elder brother and the exact opposite is true for me. I used to love watching him play through games and that's kind of carried over to twitch.
---
I'm going to keep going along with this in a much more neutral manner because you clearly have major personal problems with twinks.
---
&gt; playing a deliberately highly antisocial strategy because spoiling the game for everyone else is fun for you personally. 
---
Guild twinks exist, they were exceptionally popular in vanilla and TBC (I can't comment after that as that was after my time) and are also exceedingly popular in all lower brackets (19,29,39) in private severs.  There is nothing anti-social about twinking.  You see the same few people and even full fledged twink guilds in those brackets when you become a regular. Its it own sub-set community and I've personally gone off and done more with twink guilds such as 39 guild gank in STV, 29/19 gank in redridge, defend in shimmering flats, etc.
---
I can say without a shadow of a doubt that calling twinking anti-social is disingenuous at best, and malicious at worst to condemn and entire community of players within WoW.
---
&gt;It's a dick move, and nobody would ever willingly play with you if they knew you would do it, but it's not cheating.
---
PvP is not some care bear festival. Most players who are interested in Classic/Vanilla is because of the nature of PvP.  Its an actual MMO war with a real "us versus them" mentality.  If you don't feel this way then you have the option to roll on a PvE server and not engage in pvp at all.  People with different mind sets may not play or participate. But PvP focused players will not be looking for full on PvE carebare players to accompany them.  PvP players will attract other PvP players -- and they will want to join them.  Just because YOU feel its a dick move, does not mean everyone hold that opinion.
---
&gt;But to do it, you have to assume that the pleasure you get out of seal-clubbing levellers justifies it, even though you know you are ruining the game for others and getting nothing out of it yourself.
---
Levelers can easily avoid twinks with minimal effort.  If they (the anti-twink mindset players) don't want to compete or play with them in BG's, then don't? Leveling is a huge part of the game and you naturally level beyond the scope of twinks by natural game play.  There is nothing being ruined here aside your feelings in a low level battleground. Most players who are focused on level hardly enter  BG's in the first place as it slows down the leveling process.  Also, not all twinks are focused on "seal-clubbing", Sure some do, but to assume that is all there is totally dismisses twink v twink rivalries and games that do in fact happen. 
---
&gt;Let me remind you that it is 100% guaranteed that you are being a douchebag if you have to change the subject from "what I ought to do if I am a decent human being" to "what I can get away with". Yes, you are "allowed" to twink. That doesn't mean you don't deserve to be shamed for it.
---
How does that logic not apply to literally any normal gameplay that happens on PvP servers?  It really sounds more like you are just anti-pvp.  Why do you feel players with better gear are douchbags for pvping?  What does "being a decent human being" have literally anything do to with anything in a battleground -- a part of the game where the objective is to kill other players?  Why are players doing something that is normal considered by you "getting away with" anything?  Should I also be shamed for ganking in Strangle thorn vale? Should I be shamed for killing a player who is also farming Rich Thorium veins? Should I be shamed for trying to farm a region of mobs (i.e. farms in the western plaguelands) and killing competition?  Why are 60's with rank 13/14 gear or AQ/Naxx raid gear barred from feeling *shamed* about killing players with worse gear?  I hope you realized the audacity of your stance.  Where is the line drawn by you where normal gameplay happens and "*douchebag*" begins? Is it arbitrary at things you personally dislike? Or is there some imaginary moral compass you have neglected to inform anyone about in a game based on a fictitious fantasy war with Orcs and Humans?
---
I hate the people I work with... so ya.
---
What are you implying?
---
Boomkin could probably do it. Just take up alchemy for some mana pots as Boomkin is a huge mana drain.
---
Druids are great! you will have alot of fun.
---
I want to play an undead mage with enchanting.
---
Does anyone know if there are good addons for automating the selling of mage food/water and/or enchants?
---
Use that staff from the searing gorge quest that gives you 0.5s attack speed.  No damage, but you should get that proc ASAP.
---
My gut memory is a month but it may have been shorter. It's been a while. Maybe it was only a week or two.
---
when you talk pvp you think About duels only it seems.
---
good luck with that attitude in classic. a mage brings a whole lot more Utility to a premade then a wl does, you will never find a wsg prem without a mage but a wl is replacable, they lacke the cc of a mage and can easily get caught.
---
i get where you are coming from and thats a sad place.
---
back in vanilla my guild was focused on helping the raid and progress. the happines and satisfaction on downing another Boss outweighted the loot by far. everyone helped each other and was happy that some nice item droped, didnt matter who got it. ofcourse we had to keep it fair but some key people needed to be equiped.
---
and once progress was done the loot mattered even less cause we could do it anyway.
---
but that was in times we wiped month on cthun till we finaly got it...
---
now with more or less instant satisfaction it probably wont pan out that way again
---
Thought that was japan

I'm taking 9 days off work for Classic's release.

Hype.
---
Best office chair, period.
---
I never linked Linkin Park with vanilla for me it's much more Rob zombie killswitch engage etc.
---
In your opinion...
---
Sorry but end-game wow has really put me off after so many expansions. 
---
Plus, I got life goals in and outside of work - and catering to WOW will impact those.
---
you can't rely on potions while leveling. It would be really expensive and you'd never get your mount
---
I’ve played exclusively Horde since Vanilla. Having a hard time deciding whether to go Horde for the nostalgia or go Alliance to experience essentially brand new content.
---
That's not what git gud means
---
It means 'keep trying until you get better', not 'your mind set is inapproiate'.
---
If Blood Elves were in Classic, I'd go Horde without a second thought. But since they're not... I just don't really like any of the other Horde races that much so I'm probably going to remake my original character who was a Night Elf hunter.
---
Sounds like you would be a great candidate for... hunter!
---
No they didn't. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A
---
Warcheifs blessing, darkmoonfaire and ZG buff already on there
---
Tetris had so many different games yeah. As a franchise i have no doubt that it sold more.
---
Can you provide a link?  Thanks.
---
What is your in-game goal? A lot depends on how are you gonna answer this question.
---
I was a fire mage in classic until, like you, I saw someone AoE grinding pirates in Tanaris and it BLEW. MY. MIND.
---
I immediately respecced and was amazed at how I could suddenly go from killing one mob at a time to ten. I felt like a god from then all the way til 60. Fortunately TBC came out before I could realise how much of a noob I was.
---
... elite quest in low-lvl zone?
---
oh, so the social aspect you so direly miss in retail... is standing next to an elite guy, inviting the 2-3 people around you, killing said elite guy, then disbanding and moving on to wathever each of you is doing?
---
I also don't need faith. It's experience from beta
---
Maybe the alien thing, even tho non of these characters were aliens, and if spock is there hes only half alien at that...
---
HIER KOMM DIE SONNE
---
Unfortunately there is no perfect loot distribution system. DKP has a lot of problems with hoarding and not getting upgrades while waiting for BiS. It punishes new ppl and can be easily exploited.
---
Loot Council has a chance of working if you are lucky with your leadership. DKP is guaranteed to fail.
---
Yup
---
Hunters shine a lot more in a non-raid environment, which admittedly is where a lot of time is spent even at level 60. Raid bosses don't drop a lot of gear and in a raid of 40 people it can be a while before that item you want pops up and you manage to loot it, so you have plenty of time to run level 60 dungeons like Stratholme (both undead and live side), LBRS, UBRS, Scholomance etc. to help gear you up there. Apart from PvE content hunters also shine in PvP brilliantly. In both of these areas a good hunter can make your life so much easier by not only providing good burst damage but also utility in the form of kiting, CC, stealth detection, and mana drains. 
---
Kiting and CC might seem like simple things, but it takes a bit of finesse to pull it off. When you are able to trap effectively and/or kite (when you have to) dungeon runs become smooth and opposite faction players will literally pull their hair out trying to catch you while you blow them apart. Stealth detection is also a huge thing for mostly pvp but it's super huge there, because rogues and druids catching people off-guard usually results in somebody's death. If you see them before they get to you or anyone else they've lost a huge advantage and you've just gained a huge advantage over them. 
---
Mana drain is also massive in both pve and pvp. There's even a raid boss in AQ that specifically calls for people to drain its mana, and apart from that you can drain healer mobs' mana so they're forced to run up and melee with their wimpy melee attacks. In pvp mana drain absolutely fucks over any caster unless their team is paying attention and has someone to cleanse it, otherwise they can basically kiss their mana goodbye which means no heals or casts of any kind. 
---
Hunters also have a variety of pets they can use and most types of pets do different things which can include extra buffs for your raid group or dungeon group. Last but not least, no glancing blows, which means unless you miss an attack you are doing full damage against whatever you're hitting. So while you may not be the top DPS in raids you are consistently providing damage safely from a distance while being on standby with all the utility your class has to offer should the situation arise. You also have the added benefit of being one of the easiest classes to level up and play solo for all the reasons listed above. Hunters are crazy good when played effectively, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
---
it certainly had less of a cartoon style before
---
most of the new models bounce and move way too much when doing certain animations (dwarves and trolls now unplayable for me in retail due to how much vert they get on their run cycles). they also have exaggerated expressions that would make wc3 knights uncomfortable and hair that doesn't really look like real hair (see retail human pinecone beards). definitely more cartoony now
---
I want to roll a shadow priest (alliance side) but still not sure which race to pick ! 
---
I heard that dwarf is the best option out of human dwarf &amp; elves, but i'm not sure I'll like their spell animations. Is there a place in which I can see how a dwarf shadow priest cast its spells ?
---
I'll be playing on Carrot on a Stick
---
US and Oceania now, EU later... apparently.
---
He is peak wife material
---
I stream myself and I get random people telling me how to play the game but I'm not a manchild boosted in viewers by excessive gambling.
---
Would recommend a leveling build for Prot, then respec to a tankier Prot @ 60. Lots of fun to be had leveling as 2-hander Prot. You can still put a 1h/shield on at a moment's notice to tank, and will deal massive threat in dungeons with minor mana expenditure.  
---
 [https://i.postimg.cc/kgN2Y8rj/Prot-Pal-Lvl.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/kgN2Y8rj/Prot-Pal-Lvl.jpg)   
---
\^ You can go Ret or Holy after getting Reck; Ret gives you mana efficiency and single target dps/tps. Holy gives your AoE threat. Don't underestimate the TPS value of even a Rank 1 Consecrate either; lots of threat for small mana thanks to multipliers.
---
Updoot for Illegal Danish reference
---
&gt; yes even the "big" buffs are only 15 minutes longs and you have to buff everyone one by one.
---
Incorrect, the 15min buffs buff all members of the same class, so you have to buff a maximum of 8 times per 15min.
---
Aah gotcha, we get stuff late as usual lol. Thanks for the info!
---
We aren't your girlfriend. Ask her directly. #Joke.
---
Already took off 8 work days just to see how high level I can get. 
---
Trying to make plans now for most efficient places to level, profession grinding, etc.
---
If it's red, it's dead
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I feel like those coming *back* to Classic (i.e. vets) remember what it was like being a noob, and are generally either patient, or able to help you out (offhealing, offtanking, marking mobs for CC if you don't know the dungeon well).
---
Will I never roll on any loot? Of course not, I'll roll on upgrades.
---
Will I roll on loot I have no loot for just so I can sell it for a few gold? Definitely not. That's uncouth.
---
If you're talking about loot, you're talking about YOUR FACTION. Why are you at war with your allies?
---
I’d give a caveat, though... Play what you want, *but if you want to be easily invited to endgame 40-man content, don’t be too stubborn to try healing. You’re one of 3 classes that can even heal, and most raids need healers...*
---
This narrative is ruining my desire to play warrior again.  Every kid thinks they'll be hot shit trying to top DPS as warrior.
---
Take the "classic" off then, right?
---
Yeah, we were server first everything and rarely used consumables in anything except complete walls that we knew we could finally get down that night if we had the extra boost.
---
Cthuun and like everything that wasn't the spider wing in naxx were the first time I even used a flask lol
---
At this point just play what interests you, I honestly think people are overthinking everything with the whole “you’ll never get invited to raid and your family will disown you if you play X, Y OR Z”
---
I'd go warrior since it seems you don't mind tanking and you'll be able to raid for gear. 
---
I think rogues work well as nice alt to do sneaky stuff on.
---
None, because they can't see your spec.
---
Hmmm. I live in st pete and could do this but not sure if working
---
Appendix
---
I hope there is at least one server where Layering is completely turned off so they can see what that feels like and how it performs.
---
I understand thst thought process, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's true at every raid level. Good warriors do the most dps.
---
Now you too can experience that bit of awkward and awesome when you run into another fan in the wild. Speaking as someone with the plate "4DHORDE".
---
That and also would have loved to have troll druids as well as we've seen plenty of those as well.
---
So I tried this. My account got hacked in Wotlk. I didn't try and get it back until last year, during legion.
---
I got my account back, but I will never be allowed to play wow on it again, due to the amount of criminal activities the people who stole it did. So this account is banned for life, with no option of ever getting it back.
---
You might be able to get it back, but just because you get your account back, doesn't mean you will be able to play wow with said account.
---
You were in but now i will call my uncle bc you are not ablr to test things if you are asking such questions
---
This.
---
To be honest I think a Google search and reading through different guides will be more helpful than this thread. 
---
Also every Friday is a class specific thread, you can search for them in the sub.
---
Usually the questions here are not answered in too much detail.
---
You don't get stormstrike because it takes up a debuff slot
---
meanwhile on beta my priest is wanding most of the time, healing maybe once per fight...
---
Makes sense, thank you so much, I’m really looking forward to the guide!
---
Hahaha okay, your reply shows you clearly hold some personal grudge against summit. Nice one, comparing your 100 viewers to summit's 100k viewers that pass by in one day. I'm sure it's the same thing!
---
You sound much more excited about the Mage pro's than the Lock pro's so maybe you've already made up your mind :)
---
I ran Ele/Resto for leveling, and well into 60 as a backup healer for raids. I wasn't taken to Naxx in a hybrid spec, but all others were just fine.
---
UD is much worse than troll. DP is like 900 mana at rank 6 or 7, and is dispellable by paladins priests and shamans. curse of weakness which is really only good for blackout procs only has one tick. Troll shadowguard can be applied rank 1 but at max rank does more damage than mindflay, and each tick can prock blackout. + berserk into heal when out of form.
---
Paladins are hands down better than Shamans. I don’t know what you’re talking about.  Ele and Enh are both niche PvP specs. Holy paladins are the best PVE and PvP healer by a large margin.
---
not to mention DP is 3 min cd
---
Does your guide include graveyard skips? I've heard graveyards work differently in classic compared to private servers. In teldrassil, if you die to the right of the Oracle Glade (past the river) do you revive at aldrassil the starting area or in darnassus? I'm also curious about Darkshore, since there is a graveyard at the border to Ashenvale, in my runs I die in southern darkshore to get teleported to Auberdine graveyard.
---
Yes they're perfectly good as Humans as well.
---
This is one of those arguments "where do you draw the line".
---
Should they "fix" tauren melee range? Should they fix some bugs and exploits? Becomes a bit of slippery slope. 
---
I think Blizz chose a good common ground point with some QOL changes that were not in original Vanilla while leaving the rest as it was.
---
Spirit is nice and the other priest race abilities arent bad, mostly damage based though. They get left out due to healings role in raiding, but the others are fun for pvp and shadow.
---
If you wanna heal go pala but if you wanna focus on the burst of the Ele go 3 min Mage.
---
Correct.
---
just know that you will be healing in raids there is no way around it, youre gonna be resto. im not an expert but i remember hearing about druids suffering as they get higher levels so its worth really looking into if youre thinking about rolling druid, rogue is definitely a safe option if you want a reliable, fun class
---
&gt; I can not work for it in any tangible way, i can only hope that SOMEHOW i aquire the favor of the lootcouncil.In short unless i try bribe or suck to to the lootcouncil theres a big chance i wont get the item during the entirety of classic.
---
I am not a fan of full loot council, but this is plainly just not how it works in fair guilds, if the guild is inherently unfair no matter what loot system you use it will be similarily unfair. The idea of loot council is based on basic trust, imo if you can't trust your guild/raid why be there in the first place? People on fair loot councils look at things like attendence, guild donations, ect as metrics to determine who the gear will go to. 
---
This is less a problem with the loot distribution method and the people who are running it.
---
I may not need relationships or hygiene to live, but bitch I gotta eat.
---
More likley furyprot tanking
---
Orc sham+warr or troll priest+orc lock
---
Survivability and amazing buffs vs wider healing toolkit and offensive capabilities. I love both personally and will play both, Priest first. The question is do you want to be more defensive or offensive? There's also the question of mana - it's far less of an issue for Paladins than Priests, so if mana management annoys you, then I'd go Paladin.
---
Old models and textures had a lot of implied detail in them. New models are all very round, smooth, and the textures seem super flat. It gives them a soft smooth cartoony look.
---
Go tank RFK at 29 or 30. Get Corpsemaker. Thing will carry you for a while until you can solo your ww axe quest if needed.

Mortal strike won't be allowed in raids and from this build you are missing a ton of useful stuff. It won't be good but neither is ret boomkin etc. etc. and they seem to get invites to raids so why not.  IMO you will have better success going this build and offtanking: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxkAboxdAZxbuo
---
Some points can easily be changed, but the important is the mortal strike, last stand, 1 point in shield block for extra block, and the 5 crit from fury. Basically what I'd imagine is you either dpsing with 2hander or putting on nightfall, and then being the dedicated 2nd/3rd tank.
---
&gt;Caring about streamers
---
I respect you disagree with me.
---
But i firmly believe my WoW playing has an impact on my life style and demands all my attention or none at all.
---
That is just my personality - I get bored of It when I half ass it - and I get too aggressive when I lean into something.
---
And I can see myself going either way and just feeling like I’ve wasted my time.
---
Maybe people don’t understand where I’m coming from - and my relationship  with WoW.
---
It has given me some fantastic moments - but it has also taken a lot away from me due to my addiction to it in my teens. 
---
My coping mechanism is to set boundaries and to not over commit. 
---
It’s easier to say at 60 I’ll quit - rather than after AQ or after Naxx.
---
But then you'd have to be a gnome, f that
---
I watch streamers for times when I want to play games but can't (i.e. at work).  I'll also watch some smaller streamers who actually have decent communities built around because I can get people to play with.  
---
I still don't get why people throw so much money at them, especially all the sob stories or how people are saving up to make donations/subs.  But hey, if I could be in their situation, getting paid to play video games, I'd take it.
---
I respect your opinion but I really think the new ones look like a cheap rip off you'd find in a dollar store. Doesn't even look like the same game.
---
You failed to consider DMF and the fact that dragonslayer buff will have. Cooldown and therefore not able to be used at-will like it can be on pservers.
---
Pickpocket farming SM at ~40 isn't about the raw gold. Its to supplement your income if you can't afford your mount right then and there and also to level up your lock picking so you can pick pocket higher zones without needing some awkard lock box farming to do so.
---
I never even noticed the low(ish) quality of the real logo till I compared it to yours.
---
Layering is going to save the game....if it doesn't exist so many people will give up because of the campers ruining their WoW experience. No matter how much of a "vanilla" experience you want, it has to happen.
---
If you try to play, all the realms are offline :(
---
https://i.imgur.com/gcze7mj.png
---
Just depends on the server and guilds.
---
I was by no means a hardcore raider in vanilla. But I got to clear MC, BWL, AQ20, and ZG with my guild pretty frequently if I was on and they needed another person. Which would happen pretty frequently as peoples computers or internet would often shit the bed in 40 mans. Also helped that I was a healer.
---
But yea AQ40 and Naxx were definitely another level. Naxx in particular you could barely even walk into unless you were basically farming AQ40. At least everything but Cthun.
---
Same.......
---
Yeah the redshirts. Still don't understand what you're implying. Orcs die easily?
---
None of my buddies outside of work are down to play so this is my plan. My office is pretty chill, we can play games on break so there are already a lot of gamers here. Lots of banter too so it should be a good time. Should.
---
I thought wow 2.0 was a completely new wow game, with same classes and story?
---
I want my fucking GURKY Pet.
---
To me it's amazing that there is such a huge fanbase for "pretty" races. I always thought the Horde races were much cooler. 'Edgier' if you will.
---
Undead Rogues look like the staple toy for a 15 year old edgelord and everything else about them is just kinda "cool" (savage, wild, strong, monstrous).
---
Never ceases to amaze me how different peoples' tastes are.
---
Shadowmeld with a cat is a pretty cool combo. It might be that.
---
Masochists exist.
---
Low levels don't need to worry about mitigation really, instead the big problem is rage starvation which causes poor threat. So it can be argued that arms would actually be objectively better for low level tanking anyways.
---
Also this.
---
I know of a few players on private servers without a main who funded themselves by pick pocketing SM at 39 for cash without XP.
---
What's funny is some people are donating money to shit talk him, if I were him I'd be hamming these back seat gamers up aswell to get more money from them.
---
A Perfect Circle. Thirteenth Step. One of my favorite pvp videos from back in the day had like half that album in it. Nostalgia cranked to 11.
---
Less than 2 months until we pick our names :0
---
Funny how people have been playing pservers for years now and almost every single guild there has converted to loot council. 
---
Guess private servers guessed loot system wrong too lmao
---
I'm trying to decide between female and human male for my warrior. What do you guys think looks better?
---
Anytime the raid goes well, it's thanks to the DPS. As a healer, you will never get a thank you.
---
Anytime the raid goes wrong, it's because of the healers. As a healer, you will always get blamed.
---
Yeah, thats NA Only. I'm more interested in the EU Realms and how many Realms they will have per language.
---
What is tomorrow?
---
I have a bad news for you...
---
Is the Classic client less demanding than the BfA client? My laptop runs BfA reasonably well on medium-high settings but it would be cool to crank up Classic a bit higher.
---
Both mages and locks wear dresses; equal pro/con there. :P
---
Consider going mage over warlock early expansion because:  
---
\-Mages have higher PvE DPS early content thanks to more innate spell hit on their primary DPS.  
---
\-Good mages are worth their weight in gold. There may be lots of mages, but few will learn their class's kit well enough to be great.  
---
\-Being able to portal to capital cities is a tremendous advantage for you and your friends. Better than summoning IMO.  
---
\-Robe of the Archmage is awesome.  
---
\-Mages farm gold better than warlocks, and have the superior AoE.
---
What QoL changes will we get? Couldn't dig it up.
---
I am by no means a fan of him but what is your obsession with him and the fact that he wants to play how he wants to? Isn't it a good thing that he promote people to play whatever they want rather than everyone being the exact same race,class and spec? Cause that to me translates to a pretty boring game.
---
Let people enjoy their game how they want.
---
No lifing yourself in VR isn’t healthy for your eye health, and your in game performance will be awful, even if you somehow managed to pull it off because it would basically make you slower to respond than any other method.
---
I sometimes use a bike trainer and have WoW in front of it with a small table I can lean against and play. I’ve also tried using a treadmill with a decent incline. Both work, kind of, but your reaction times will be off the more stressed you are. It’s more a way to deal with my boredom on flight paths or while waiting for something, but I also use it when doing simpler tasks where I’m very unlikely to die by not playing and moving optimally.
---
It’s probably a lot easier to set aside some time to exercise during the day instead. You can fit a good amount of a HIIT session in during long enough flight paths. A friend used to do sets of pushups sit-ups and pull-ups between BG queues back in BC. It was his way to justify playing for so many hours sometimes.
---
It could work. It all depends on how strict your raid group is on hybrid specs. People need to realize if raid allows one person to be "hybrid" spec they must allow everyone else. So now you have a raid of PVP/Weird specs. Only time will tell if the content is indeed that trivial.
---
lol, it's a joke man.  Red shirts are prone to dying in Star Trek, as will be the Horde I encounter, not really a complicated jab.
---
You're wrong about account sharers getting world first. People who practiced their leveling route will be many hours ahead of the account sharers who didn't practice a crap ton. During the race to world first, speedrunners will sleep maybe 12-16 hours total before reaching lvl 60
---
Loot council is purely based on what values the loot council think is important. That's the whole fucking point, to have humans decide instead of some point system telling who gets what.
---
Who cares about bis MC will be a joke. Most of your time will be spent grinding 1000g for your epic mount.
---
I'm fine either way on this topic
---
It was quite good for 2 reasons.
---
1, its easy to do with zero competition.
---
2, it required zero gear.
---
It was reliable steady income that had zero dependence on the local server economy unlike lasher farming.  Most other farming spots with comparable gold/hour require selling mats or items to the AH.  Pick Pocket farming generated raw gold and if you were clever like smelting Dark Iron, disenchanted, or sold Major Health potions -- the gold per hour only went up.
---
UD used to be about a third of the horde population, followed by numerous orcs, a fair share of tauren (fewest class options) and small number of trolls. Trolls might be more popular this time since the power of berserking as a pve CD is better known these days.
---
I played off and on a lot in Vanilla. Made multiple characters and never reached 60. I was also still partially addicted to DAoC, another MMO. I didnt hit 60 until about a month before BC release.
---
Theres a full list of every guild that ever cleared Naxx somewhere. It's less than 100.
---
I’m in the stress test and mine says stress test not beta so? And yes blizz has said you need an active sub.
---
sounds like you may be a bit on the spectrum yourself, actually.
---
hah i loled.
---
&gt;I don't have the time to do that again :)
---
You have all the time in the world. Even if you just play 10 minutes a day you'll eventually get to 60. Classic is here to stay :)
---
You get blamed by dps, so meh.
---
The tank knows what’s up.
---
Hahaha, using the BWL trinket and specing everything possible to improve the Imp was my favorite meme spec for for PvP. Everyone would always ignore him and he would absolutely shred them while I just kited them around.
---
Yes, that would be nice. Anyway, I will definitely test this out, should produce some interesting results with correct hit gear imo. If it sucks super bad I'll go back to another build xD.
---
I'm trying to decide between Human Paladin and Dwarf Priest. My brother and I played Classic and TBC back in the day, his main was a shaman and I played druid. This time around we want to mix it up and go Alliance. He is definitely going Human Warrior and I want to be a good duo support partner for that. I think I could have fun with either of these classes, but just can't decide. At endgame I am hoping to do a lot of PvP, and might be able to swing some raiding for MC/BWL depending on schedule as I have a wife and kids now. Here's how they sit in my head.
---
​
---
Paladin PROs:
---
Awesome "warrior of justice" type that can wear plate, shields, and swing big cool swords and axes like my brother's warrior.
---
Probably the most durable healer in PvP and unlikely to be focused down as much.
---
If I can get it, T2 armor is the coolest set in the game (and great stats for PvP)
---
Paladin CONs:
---
Does very low dps even when specced for it. As a druid I hated never really being able to kill people fast in PvP.
---
Pretty much a buff-bot and flash of light spammer. PvE gear is mostly cloth for healing.
---
I'm worried that I'll get bored with the lack of direct damage abilities and mostly just auto attacking if I want to damage something.
---
Leveling sounds awful
---
Priest PROs:
---
Has great utility spells such as Mind Control, Mana Burn, PW: Shield, Fear Ward
---
Healing is more nuanced and not just 2 healing spells, one of which is rarely used.
---
Can spec Shadow for some actual damage if I have some gear, and get Silence which seems pretty good (though not as good as Hammer of Justice perhaps).
---
Priest CONs:
---
Likely will be a huge target in PvP. Even with shadowform, I would be much squishier than a Paladin with plate+shield.
---
Shadow gear is going to be tough to get in raids potentially, as mages and warlocks tend to get priority on the best stuff.
---
I like the roleplay of the Paladin melee, so this just doesn't seem as "cool" perhaps?
---
Can I get some perspective from people who have played one or both of these classes? Thanks to anyone who replies for your help!
---
Trust me, people that have nothing but WoW in their life are not somebody that you want to envy.  It's a pathetic, lonely life.
---
It feels amazing as arms with sweeping strikes to charge in, pull 2 mobs, pop SS and watch cleave hit them both twice for 50% of their hp
---
Why wouldn't it be the same thing? If anything having more viewers makes what those viewers think even less important. Most big streamers don't even read chat, if someone wants to interact with them they have to pay money for a TTS message to pop up lmao
---
Int lets you use more spells to get more threat and take longer fights, strength just ups melee damage which is pretty negliable from a paly tank.
---
Not much to tanking besides having your group know that you need a moment to establish threat before they start spamming damage.
---
Talents are very straight forward. You need consecrate and the prot 31 talent there isn't too much wiggle room besides the last few points which are just little stat boosts.
---
I had a good experience playing prot on a private server. Going throw lower dungeons no one minded having a pally tank just happy to get someone. Did some dungeons at 60 people were a bit more hestitent but willing to try once seeing I had some decent gear investment. It's nice that many high level dungeons are undead based because being able to use exorcism is almost like having a taunt and pull.
---
I bought a skullflame shield with a shield spike to lean into the thorns based damage and had good fun. It's sad that once you've done the dungeons you've pretty much peaked, I wish it was viable beyond that.

Lol, blast from the freaking past
---

---
This to me looks like it is wow classic beta. Because the stress test says “stress test”
---
From what I know AutoLoot is a big one. I don't believe it was in the original one. 
---
I am sure there is a YouTube video with more of them.
---
That’s fine, if you go back to my original comment I’m talking primarily PvP.
---
Only the stress test is open, today and tomorrow 48 hours only but you have to have a sub.
---
interesting... never tried but might be even better than frostbrand depending on the scaling on classic.
---
You ended in the bar because that was the end of the super dense humanoid mob packs.  You aimed to limit runs to 15 minutes and wanted as many pick pocket targets in that time frame. The "standard" route included around ~200 mobs to pick pocket within a time frame of 12-15 minutes including the dungeon exit. For reference, an SM branch holds maybe half that number of mobs.  This also doesn't include an easily killable boss (the bar keeper) for extra income, or the potential for disenchanting &amp; dark iron ore smelting.
---
I can't wait for people to complain about downtime.
---
Not only WoF but Shamans too.  At the end is just easier to play lock in the Horde.
---
You're right!
---
The ideal horde raid setup is 6-8 shaman. You honestly can't have too many.
---
Subtlety rogue.
---
Life is so much bigger than video games.
---
one of all the time great wow videos imo. peak of wow was when that video came out. not WOTLK.
---
IMO Male for hardened classes ie Warrior. Female for things like priest and mage.
---
Who is "we"? Maybe the people who spend 24/7 on this subreddit and are reading up to prepare for Classic. The average Joe, judging by their performance on retail, certainly does not have the muscle memory down.
---
troll war trash tho ...wanna go orc or my fav tauren
---
Many players are not so gold saavy.  Anything can help when you're less experienced and in a pinch for cash.
---
Second this. Hunter is always top tier in PvP. Mobility is king in PvP.
---
You didn't mention just how overpowered the warlocks fear was spam fear for days, and though mages have polymorph you have to consider the fact it just tops your enemy off at full health while fear is a much stronger cc when considering things from a pvp perspective.
---
The closest you get is probably balance druid, look up Stormlingx on Youtube, he's a really good balance druid. Not the same burst potential as ele obviously, but its a caster dps who can also heal and is much more versatile than the shaman. They probably have the same amount of keybinds as well (a lot)
---
The only real edge NE druid gets is the shadowmeld buff to stealth.
---
"Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling."
---
Thank you
---
Wow at its time was very realistic graphic wise
---
Paladins are fun they are the best class for a thorns (dmg on hit) in theory this dmg on hit or thorns can get to 200+ it’s been awhile since I’ve last looked at it. This makes a paladin nice when having to farm lower level instances. All you have to do is concentrate and heal yourself. They are one of the best single target healers in raids as they are very mana efficient, just don’t bubble your tank.
---
Locks are great solid solo class especially if you have no friends. Locks get their pet the quickest you can get an imp before you hit level 2 super easy if you are undead faction. This increases your dmg output significantly 1-6. Can solo Dire Maul West (not 100%)  pretty solid at kiting if speced into affliction not as good as hunters though. Downside is that your pets have no real taunt they just have high threat generating abilities.
---
Rogue was my first 60 in classic and I’d never looked back. Rogues are a challenge! Very weapon dependent subtlety rogues are great for pvp were combat sword rogues were all the rage for raiding. It wasn’t out of the norm to see rogues running around with the matching swords from UBRS or a Krol blade if you got lucky. Rogues can make money quick with the right pick pocketing routes.
---
Atm I am leaning towards warlock as I’ve been enjoying the class also I’ve been able to get out of the starting zone the quickest; bonus is they are tier S levelers.
---
grats
---
I guarantee you i won't. Luckily for me, not everyone is on forum / reddit / whatever, where a minority of wannabe hardcore min-maxer think for everyone :)
---
In mean, Undead Warlock is probably the race that fits the class the best right?
---
Personally surprised at how few Hunters across the whole thing, but especially few on Horde.
---
Hunter or mage you got it
---
yes, a good warrior can tank any dungeon and raid in any spec. hopefully the DPS knows how to play and use their threat reduction skills like they should be doing (no matter what type of tank they are playing with). it's a team effort. of course, if you're going to be a main tank in a raid, it's best to be a team player and go prot because you are tankier and generate more threat (the added threat generation is almost a must for untauntable bosses). most guilds i knew back then always had prot warrior as MT, if their MT was a warrior.
---
&gt;especially early on my PvE damage as 31/20 arms won't be too far behind Fury as the Fury warriors i'll be competing with will suffer a lot from low hit rating? 
---
i'm assuming you mean 40 mans. in 40 mans, we weren't too concerned with our warrior DPS as the extra warriors were offtanking in most of the raid content. the core of our DPS was always the DPS classes lol. i don't recall how big of a gap it was but fury warriors still outshined arms in raid DPS. especially on horde if you had the windfury totem to buff them.
---
&gt;More a question of whether we'll be able to make it through the content as 31/20 Arms or whether i'm really wasting my time. 
---
yeah you'll be fine going 31/20 for any non raid content. especially if you're with friends. end game 5 mans and UBRS are fun and require CC and good threat management. if you guys decide to do raids, i would strongly recommend having your main tank prot spec because it would make your lives a lot easier.
---
i'm also going to be leveling a warrior with PvP focus. my route will be DW fury for leveling up to 40. then respec to get mortal strike. then work through end game content to get gear and craft arcanite reaper etc. then maybe respec to prot if i want to MT raids again.
---
TLDR: non prot spec warriors are fine for dungeons and off tanking. you'll do just fine as 31/20. you can always adjust based on how you find things end game.
---

---
Until that moment you hear the rogue. but he didn't open on you and you can't see him. Perception - kill.
---
Deathskipping is used a heap in early levels and in later levels it gets used when travelling. It does work differently in Classic; Classic will res you at the appropriate GY as opposed to pservers putting you in the start area for example. At the right of Oracle glade you’ll spawn at Darnassus - I haven’t tested it well past the river though. In Darkshore if you die in the south you’ll respawn at the southern graveyard. If you die at the Eastern side of Dun Morough you’ll respawn at Kharanos and not near Ironforge. 
---
I don’t recommend any dungeon for speed running so they aren’t in the guide. Keeping in mind the guide is designed to race from launch, by the time you get to the levels for those dungeons you are unlikely to get anyone to do a run with you. 
---
The only exception is levelling later in the game and you’re a melee class that will have a weapon for weapon progression in that dungeon - even then you need to be picky about your group.
---
Stress test starts at 5pm est
---
Tool's new album comes out 3 days after classic
---
It could work. But you’re missing Bloodcraze and Enrage which are powerful abilities in pvp.
---
Keep in mind unless you are in a hardcore raid guild I dont see you raiding more than 2 times a week. So say Tues and Thursday. All you need is 100 gold a week on respeccing. Swap to Raid spec on  Tuesday and go back to PVP spec on Thursday.
---
Comfortable ≠ Good for your back/posture
---
Step 1: Find the good tanks
---
Step 2: Friend them
---
Step 3: Profit
---
&gt;this would be something in between I guess (but still under Fury)
---
I think arms &gt; your build in terms of DPS. Fury isn't good because 5% crit and 25% offhand damage, it's good because BT, Enrage and few other more minor things. Sword specialization is indeed interesting, but I'm almost sure it's not going to compensate.
---
Def wont find a a "meme" spec from a druid. You are better off going mage for sheep pyroblast while /laugh. Or fear lock.
---
Make no mistake about it: If you are talking PvP/PvE mechanics *nothing* touches the utility of having another Fear Ward in the party/raid. It allows you to bymass mechanics in a way that other classes/races can't approach (warriors use globals and potentially waste rage with stance dancing), Tremor has a "global tick" mechanic that RNG can screw you with, etc. You should absolutely make a Dwarf Priest over any other race if you care about maximizing your contribution to the group. 5% Spirit is nothing in the grand scheme on things compared to that. I've seen guilds sit better healers just for a Dwarf with Fear Ward.
---
What would your advice be for a night elf hunter on release date? If it’s too busy, where would you grind?
---
OP, are you promoting your channel my dude? Are you trying to entice drama for views?

* If if you check the end of the video you can see he does not end his stream.
---
Does buying the $40 version give you the 1-19 Patreon guide?  I'd love to test it out on the stress test :)
---
My plan is warrior as my main, Hunter as my alt, and lastly a warlock as my second alt. With a somewhat limited play schedule I know they all won’t be up to date and that’s fine. Just excited for the fun. I wanna focus on PVP at endgame on the warrior (Arms?) but also be able to OT raids if needed, without too much of a respec? Will I get into raids fine as arms though? Just a filthy casual here, thanks wife and kids.
---
I hate the new models so much
---
I fucking hate Shadowpriests so much. Their Gameplay seems so unengaging, so skill-less, so fucking boring. Yet they are Op as it gets for pressing 1 Button. Gave the Video a like though, you are skilled and used a Wand.

I thought i didn't get the joke. But i did..

"Our healing sucks"
---
Not sure if you saw the recent research, but babies are literally exiting the womb early due to Classic. Blizzard will be dedicating a baby server to the newborns. What a great company and game.
---
Loot council is the best system.
---
What happen in a dkp system when your MT leaves the guild. You wait for the next player to buy enought gear to tank? or you decide on a trustworthy fury warrior who want to tank and funneled him all the tank gear?
---
Don't be hypocrite, you'll gear a new tank and fuck the dkp system.
---
If you contribute to the guild you'll get gear. If you are a remarkable player you will get the best gear first.
---
Of course, if your loot council is corrupted, it's your fault and all the members fault to stay in that guild. 
---
On the pserver scene most EU guild used loot council and it worked well for many years. Only NA guild were using dkp and it was cancerous. If you weren't happy you could just switch guild. But be aware, you'll be categorized as a lootwhore, especially if the guild can proove you don't contribute and produce shit dps.
---
All the retail BFA  servers are like that right now, no?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L\_iOnLNt9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L_iOnLNt9M)
---
In a professional Guild Lootcouncil works and when you didnt get an item its probably because you arent the best player, which is fine but then you cant complain.
---
If you are a good player and Loot is important to you and you think everyone is corrupt and wrong then maybe be part of "some dudes forming the council".
---
Are you still calling RNG fair if some guy whos in the Guild for 2 weeks gets Lok'amir instead of you ?
---
In a casual Guild mistakes will be made, but all the more reason there that you should be part of the council yourself.
---
I understand Enrage but is Bloodcraze THAT good? 3% healing on getting crit seems pathetic on paper.
---
There is actually a built in lumbar support you can adjust to help with posture.  It's pretty wonderful and 300x better than the office chairs we have at my work that are supposed to be ergonomically superior which I sit in 7-8 hours a day.
---
I honestly loved this aspect of being a healer.
---
I could find a run for any dungeon whenever I wanted. Sometimes even multiple different groups offering at the same time so I had my pick of who I wanted to go with. On a few rare occasions I even had people pay me to come heal for them when I told them I already had a group.
---
This is one of those server reputation things I miss from classic. Since there was no name changes, you had to do a good job of maintaining your reputation on the server. People remembered you for things both good and bad. Which is generally how the servers punished ninja looting. A guy on my old server actually ninja looted a binding and got black listed. No raiding guild on the server would take him on runs because his reputation was ruined.
---
I'm sure he eventually did get runs though and finished TF after Blizzard sold their soul and he could race change / name change and essentially be anonymous.
---
Just put in for my vacation today haha
---
Also, is it correct to assume I can just make a bunch of random lvl1s to reserve names and later delete and make new chars, names reserved for 30 days or something?
---
no no, I’m not hearthing... You guys are doing good
---
I'll make sure to thank our healers now.
---
Expand the numbers a bit more. It might be acceptable in that small amount of clears, but let's look at this model after time has gone on for a bit and the game is maturing (as is the guild and its progression.) Let's just double the quantity of raids for a semi-realistic model. Bear in mind that the raids reset weekly with the exception of 20 man. What if Larry shows up for 14 clears, Andy has 10 clears, and Carl has 3? Larry spent an additional full 4 weeks clearing the content in hopes of getting the item he wants. On raid #15 it finally drops and both players want it. Andy wins it because of your dice roll mechanic. 
---
Guess how Larry feels at this point? I guarantee that Larry would leave the guild. And now your guild has an Andy who doesn't show up consistently, and lost a Larry who does. And Larry's tradeskills / consumables / whatever other efforts he puts toward the guild.
---
ur such a badass

That shouldn't be a problem if you are functional adults.

Good lord, take a chill pill. Man you must be a prepubescent degenerate troll or a angry little manchild.  Either way, definitely terrible company to be around.

&gt;Undead Rogues look like the staple toy for a 15 year old edgelord and everything else about them is just kinda "cool" (savage, wild, strong, monstrous).
---
I think that's why I don't like them lol. To me ''cool'' is something with grace, mystique, honor, magic. I think it stems from the fact that I can relate more to the the lean, agile nature of Elves rather than the pure strength and bulkiness of races such as Orcs or Tauren. Come to think of it, I always prefer playing slim and graceful ''pretty'' character in every game. 
---
But I already liked these sorts of aspects when I was a kid and played Warcraft 3, that's where my interest for the Blood Elves and their lore started. I also quite liked the Night Elves in that game. So when I finally got World of Warcraft as a 10 year old, I already had my two favorites.
---
It's not just rogues lol. Undergeared warriors are the same. Priests are just that wild in PvP.
---
Pretty sure Blizzard already stated you can reserve up to 3 per account, not even server. Take my words with a grain of salt though im not completely sure and feeling too lazy atm to check for a sauce
---
I just think of Maydie and When Demons Awake. :D
---
I have started sending these memes to my wife, to prepare her. I have also started making videos for my son. That way he can remember what I look like later in life.
---
yes, 3
---
thanks dude I'm tryin not to flex too hard, just can't help it
---
&gt; but if you wanted to win an argument this is not the graph to use.
---
Surprised by how many don't get this. People have been using these subreddit survey results (there's been a few) as facts for their arguments for months now.
---
I think you can only make three
---
It's nice to see the numbers, but I'm wondering how many people selected classes that aren't going to be their mains. I know a lot of people will just mess around knowing that everything is getting erased on launch.
---
No. The troll racial for regen is largely useless. Pretty sure +1 spirit is better
---
If you don't like to set up macros you could use an addon. There's probably quite a few who can do this, but i recommend bartender4 if you are on the beta or PFui if you play elsewhere. 
---
They both have a feature where you can just hover over the actionbar button and press the key combination you want.
---
Even better they have a paging feature where if you press a certain modifier (like alt, shift or ctrl, but it can be anything), the entire bar changes and you can put out spells from the spell book while holding down that button.
---
You could also consider buying an MMO mouse. They tend to be quite large (you mentioned small hands) but some of them are adjustable like the Corsair one.
---
If you do get a MMO mouse then you get 12 buttons accessible by your thumb and usually 2-5 additional button accessible by your middle finger. When you combine that with paging by an addon or macros then you get 14+ more buttons times the number of modifiers you use. 
---
TLDR; Get a MMO mause and easily get 42 more buttons within reach.
---
*whispers* It's the beards
---
I'd like to know your opinion on Herb/Alch and Engineering. I know I'm going to be rolling a Rogue in Classic, and originally I was going to go Herb/Alch, but I'm reading fairly often how crazy powerful Engineering is for PvP and some PvE. What are your thoughts on going Herb/Eng on my main and having an Ench/Alch bank alt?
---
Well you'll be able to create 3, so RIP to this dumb idea
---
I'm talking about launch day, not 2 weeks before.
---
&gt;If MC was designed to need +20% attack power and +20% Mana Regen, +500 health, wouldn't there be a buff right fukin outside?
---
What purpose would that serve?  It's extra development work for something that serves no purpose other than to make numbers bigger.  Tuning a dungeon to require a buff that you then give to players automatically doesn't make sense *unless you have an in-game reason for that buff existing.*
---
World buffs have an in-game reason for existing.  Good job, you slayed Onyxia!  Have a reward.  Just because it's not explicitly tied to other dungeons doesn't mean Blizzard didn't anticipate it being used in that manner.  We use gear obtained in other dungeons, and not just in a linear progression: remember farming Nature resist gear in Maraudon for AQ progression?  If AQ was designed to need Nature resist gear, wouldn't there be Nature resist gear waiting right outside?
---
One reason we love Classic WoW is that it truly is a world.  The interplay of these world buffs is part of that.  It keeps old content relevant.  It provides a sliding scale between effort and skill: if your guild is stuck during progression, putting effort into world buffs can help mitigate that.  If your guild is full of pros, you don't need to put in so much prep work.
---
Sounds like a huge dick move to me. Why do you need 40-100 names on multiple servers? Why not just try to get a handful of the ones you want the most, instead of hoarding dozens of names you most likely won’t use?
---
I *really* like their newest album *I, The Mask* actually. Really feels like a return to old style In Flames while still accommodating that Anders (vocalist) voice can't handle what it used to.
---
Before this most recent one, I think the last In Flames album I thought was amazing would have been Come Clarity.
---
How will you get those sweet pvp rewards with no pvp?
---
Do you randomly open and close your eyes when you read ?
---
You clearly read some words of my post but skipped like 3/4
---
This is tough! Both are fun classes... I personally like rolling with whatever I think is cooler/whatever class's personal lore/aesthetic I can get into more. 
---
I haven't seen a lot about holy paladin pvp (not since the Wrath-era "Holy Pally" video and song lol), so maybe someone will say something to shoot that down, but you do have some decent cooldowns.
---
As far as leveling goes, from 1-10 paladin is super strong. After that the playing field evens out a lot more. But there's something to be said for being able to whack at shit and heal yourself. Until warriors start getting lots of rage they're like paladins (auto attacking sadly) but without the ability to actually heal.
---
Oh dont mind me then and lol that s a ballsy plan GL with it x)
---
Have you checked out attack animations to see which appeals to you more?
---
Paladins are exceptionally useful to party/raid gameplay, but exceptionally boring to play at 60 IMO. The one exception would probably be smaller scale 5-10 person PvP. In that situation, a well-kitted Holy Paladin can break the enemies offensive strategy and foil a swarm of rogues. It's a beautiful thing to watch.  
---
With that said, their PvE roles are making sure the right buffs go out, then spamming Flash of Light. It's abysmal, and easily the least satisfying of the healers to play in Vanilla PvE IMO. YMMV.  
---
Priests scale with gear faster/better, have more utility as you said, have *fear ward* because of course you went Dwarf Priest, and have spells for any situation. However as a priest you *need to know* when to use what spell. A bad priest will negatively impact a raid more than a bad Paladin IMO.   
---
In the end I'd take Dwarf Priest because it has a higher PvE skill cap, and you're less likely to burn out with the gameplay for those reasons.
---
You can only have 50 characters max. So 50 is your limit on day one.
---
Well if your set on that then here comes the real hard part.... what pets will take up your 3 slots....
---
[Petopia] (https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)
---
I mean, Orcs and consorting with Demons is probably a much better fit than Forsaken (or Humans, or Undead in general).
---
no one actually read the words 'by launch', as in I intend to do this at launch.  cmon people.
---
Unpopular opinion: Making threads about how things should be different from how they were in classic isn't "classic".
---
50 chars is the cap on amount of chars I guess. Atleast thats the cap in retail.
---
Those are some pretty big assumptions based upon my anecdotal experience.
---
Aren't they just empty? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If you are pve healing it doesnt matter too much. Paladins get 0 benefit from spirit and weapon skills do not matter unless you are prot/ret. 
---
As for rep, that is honestly important if you are planning to get exalted with any reps. For instance for the winterspring tiget mount and such. Or the AQ gear and what not.
---
Dwarfs get stoneform which will help in certain situations as a healer/ret/. But more helpful if you are tanking or pvping. But you have the MAJOR downside of being ugly as hell as a dwarf.
---
Cuz.. everyone has the opportunity?  someone will likely do the same so fight fire with fire or be left in the dust?
---
Thanks! Haha
---
As long as I get

---
It's all that matters
---
good enough, that's just over 5 pvp servers.
---
Only a "casual" raiding guild would consider fielding a warrior with Mortal Strike. 31/5/15 is a fine build for being MS and Defiance in PvP/dungeons, but in raids is sub-optimal and not recommended. You should never, ever hit MS in a raid because of the limitation to debuffs, so essentially you're raiding without a 31 point talent. GL HF!
---
Unless your name is recognized in the wow community you don't really need to "reserve" the name. 
---
I don't think we will see that many Legolas variations this time around.
---
Or they just increase the number of vms for this stress test.
---
No point having that much servers when release.
---
Anyway if your Warrior friend is good he should know how taunt works in Vanilla. You shouldnt be needed to cast fade in the first place.
---
Wow look at the amount of videos and compare to subscribers, he is definitely trying to promote his shitty channel.
---
How do you know theres going to be an afterwards?
---
November 05 - November 09
---
Somehow it felt like longer than 4 years...
---
There was always something fundamentally comforting about your tank being a big-ass hunk of beef Tauren. Best race for Warriors for PvE no matter what anyone says! :)
---
By not caring about pvp.
---
Limit  of 50 total
---
Also gear. If you are running with a t2 healer in brd then you can be 2h tanking arms/fury no problem. When everyone is in phase 1 and your healer is shadow and your dps doesn't know optimal damage rotation there are going to be plenty of failed BRD groups and wasted travel time.
---
Pretty much a meme spec in PVE terms. Mortal strike is based on weapon damage. If you're dual wielding, you will almost guaranteed do lower dps than if you just DPS'ed with a 2 hander. You would try to gear yourself like a fury warrior, but your main ability would do less damage than if you just went 20/31/0. I like the concept, but the reality is with MS as your main source of damage relying on weapon damage you'll be gimping yourself by not using a 2-hander.
---
I believe Engineering is mandatory if you are serious about pvp.
---
Also check out some old GWAR
---
Sounds reasonable
---
Lmao I’m thinking about female human paladin cuse they have way cooler casting animation
---
Especially given that the two major pvp classes, by popularity, benefit a lot from WotF. Mages can blink out of stuns, for instance. And rogues are gonna be putting themselves into position to stun, not be stunned. Against a rogue? The one who pops the first stun should win, so it's strong there, sure. The other major long stun, then, is the pally one, which is a long CD, IIRC. But getting feared and dotted up as a rogue? That's fucking trouble, and it sucks to lose a trinket slot to prevent it. Locks can just chain fear and/or seduction and /laugh. Shadow priests are real strong if they manage to fear, you can't afford for them to create that gap.
---
My priest friend went on his mage to grind mobs with my warrior and this Hunter wanted to group up to help him with killing elite mobs for a quest.  His pet died so many times so fast he kept trying to tell me how to tank and kept shooting my friends sheep because everything was getting pulled.  His ww axe friend was 3rd in dps according to my friend and we were all around level 30.  I let his pet die one of the times just so I could bandage mid fight it was crazy.  After that we got in discord to talk about what the hell just happened.  My friend would have got on his priest to heal through it if the Hunter wasn't a jerk and if he wasn't shooting the sheep.  Even mobs no where near what we were fighting he'd turn to just to shoot the sheep.  I still feel bad for that hunters pet and the amount of animal abuse it puts up with.
---
It was interesting to see that mage is more popular for Alliance but warlock is more popular for Horde.
---
The wowhead dressing room allows you to see all animations.
---
I'm so torn about this right now... I absolutely love healing and will main a priest and level one up first and solo. However, I have two friends that I will be leveling an alt with and they have never played the game before. I had them play to about 20 on a pserver just so they could try out a class and they settled on a druid and warlock. My friend that is playing the druid will most likely stick to feral. He is always more of a tank player in every game we play but didn't really want to go with a warrior. 
---
A little about us is that we will be rolling on a PvE server and will focus mostly on PvE.
---
Now my issue is I'm not sure exactly what I want to play with them. We aren't committed to alliance or horde, and I've thought Paladin or Shaman depending on which side we go with so we can instantly get groups together for dungeons because I would heal with either of those classes and between the three of us it would be relatively easy to share loot since the warlock and I would be in minor competition early on and that would lessen as we gained in levels. These choices worry me though because I really don't want to spend a lot of money respeccing but I want my alt to be able to farm things more effectively than my priest will be able to and I'm not really sure I would get a lot of that on either a paladin or a shaman. I doubt I will use this alt to pvp at all and raiding with it will likely not be in progression runs either, and my main will be fairly casual on those as it is.
---
So with all that said and to add to the wall of text, I'm also slightly interested in trying out a warrior or mage as well and can't seem to decide what would be best for us leveling and for me at 60 to farm with.
---
TL:DR I need to choose a class to level with a warlock and druid tank that would benefit that group while leveling but also farm efficiently at 60. Alliance or Horde.
---
Any advice on affording your mount at 40 while speed running? I've heard that drop rates for grays are different on beta and I'm not sure of the impact.
---
I mained Pally in Vanilla and was drawn towards Priest basically because I wanted to play a different healer and have a easier/better leveling experience. So thankfully it will be less painful... I hope.
---
*BRIENNE OF TARTH INTENSIFIES*
---
If you have an active subscription and are in the US or Oceania, you can play the stress test and roll a dwarf priest to see their animations. There may also be a place on Wowhead to view animations, but I’m not sure. 
---
Personally I think dwarf females have better animations so I’m going that route
---
ORLY? Can't wait to level a human warrior, with mining blacksmithing and having to do a fuckton of fishing to make mount money
---
Isnt this just a "WoW VR Experience" where someone rebuild Dalaran for VR?
---
A recipe for disaster.  It's entirely possible to find guilds with similar skill levels as yourself who are nice to play with.  Reaching out to real life friends is a crapshoot.  There are plenty of delightful people who play games and are absolutely horrendous at them.  Every senseless wipe will cause more and more friction.
---
You don't need much int just enough to cycle through a couple of consecrates and seals. The bad prot paladins are the ones who blow mana and drink after every pull. The good ones use a combination of JoW, SoR and Consecrate to tank with almost 0 down time. SoR procs JoW, so get a fast one hand, and with SoR you regain mana super quick, practice the rorations on different group to figure out how to tank different combination groups without constantly blowing seals and judging as this burns mana  
---
Blessing your party generates threat so save your buffing for when your fighting and learn to multitask  
---
Don't stack defense in your build when leveling, let redoubt / reckoning do your defensive work and extra threat gain.  
---
Get a shield spike asap  
---
Learn to use BoP on target of target if  you loose agro  
---
Check out KillerDuki (His BRD run is good for highlighting rotations). Ignore some of his stuff and claims though as hes massively biased. He makes good points but is unrealistic at times, but knows his stuff.
---
So you're saying, it's learning things about me? Seems like an invasion of privacy.
---
Once they brought in faction change and all the kiddies started jumping ship to the Horde due to all the best guilds being Horde side on pretty much every server.
---
Yeah they are around. On my pally, all the skills are very necessary. So omw to Goldshire I ran to SW and got some for 2 sil each.  Taboo for speed running, but not being able to train your skills will also bottle neck you.
---
Yea, same. Not gonna listen to a 1.5 hours long podcast. I know some people love that but it's never been my thing. Yet I'd really love to know what he has to say about MC
---
Hybrid Lootcouncil systems are much more common than plain ones
---
These "gaming chairs" never had any reputation to be good to actually sit in, more like a marketing stunt, but whatever floats your boat, chairs are really subjective.
---
Honestly, gold farmers wouldn't bother me that much if they didn't do shit like steal accounts. Happened to me, and it was a pain in the ass.
---
If you don't have time to do the usual MMO grind, it might not be the genre for you.
---
But those quick queues tho
---
The problem with arms is that with only 16 debuff slots, using Mortal Strike means you're potentially kicking off other, useful debuffs for one that has no effect whatsoever in the vast majority of encounters. Add deep wounds to that - while it's great for the warrior using it, it doesn't do anything for anyone else - and the question isn't "Should I take this arms warrior over someone else?", but "Should I take this arms warrior over just leaving the raid slot empty?".
---
It is if you enjoy leveling but not grinding gold. Which this loopy as OP clearly fucking loves leveling.
---
Well it'd be nice to have some meme characters if I want to go that route, and 3 and 4-character names will go pretty quick so best to snag them early if you want one.
---
Female human loots better in DPS gear. I'd take the male human in heavy plate though. Not a tremendous fan of either, but **dat racial**.
---
When is that established though?  Is that after they gave out the free to play up to X level?  Is that vanilla specific?  This really matters because the impression of the statistic might seem hefty, but maybe not.  Looks like clickbait really.
---
It would be cool to have this to read, Im at work and I do not listen to podcasts.
---
No they definitely do not. I plan on playing when it come out, but you bet your ass I don’t have hours to spend “perfecting the art” and additional hours getting every name I can across all the servers.
---
It’s pretty damning of your argument, when your point is that you can act in an assholeish manner just because someone else is bound to. Sound fucking logic.
---
Have you ever gone back and played an old RPG that you haven't played for like 10+ years? That feeling of discovery can definitely come back. You often forget most of the details and thus you still have to figure it out.
---
The vanilla world hasn't been around since Cata and that was like 9 years ago now. So not only will the details of that world be hard to remember for most, the gameplay is definitely something that will feel new again. People are still trying to properly remember shit as it was (and the private servers didn't even completely remember, as they had a lot of mistakes).
---
because of the big quest drought at 46-47 on alliance I think those dungeons would be recommended for 99% of players. Grinding is only worthwhile if you're a hunter/warlock and five levels above everyone else at 46 I'd say. Mostly everyone will want to pick up carrot on a stick and scepter of celebras. I guess people can just skip the grinding part of your guide and do the dungeons.
---
Yeah it's a win win situation for everyone, really!
---
I can scroll my mousewheel as well as the next mage.
---
Got this as well (EU account, + US starter edition account)
---
In group PvP (like a battleground) I mostly use a felhunter.  
---
Succ is great for 1v1s but I like being able to dispell a magic debuff.
---
If you are alliance the succ is also countered often by wotf
---
I’m almost positive the answer to this is no. I think the weapon skill cap for glancing reductions is 308 with minimum glancing reduction of 5%, and that’s ONLY against bosses or level 63 trash. The stats you could get on a pair of gloves would be worth way more. An Orc using anything other than Axe would want Edgemaster’s, though.
---
Imagine being someone who thinks people wont boost people in dungeons for gold (regardless of method).
---
It's happened since launch and still happens today.
---
Some people don't like the look of Horde and prefer the "softer" Alliance models. Some prefer being Human due to "RP factor." Also, some like being the classic "good guy" faction but that is debatable since we now know the lore but still you get the point. I think some of the zones/cities are nicer to look at and be in personally. However, this time friends want to go Horde so we'll see.

ALBIAN ONLINE IS AN MMO WHERE YOU ARE WHAT YOU WEA-- *skip ad*

I was a wannabe ret paladin back in vanilla, I wanted to smack people with my big weapon and big plate shoulders with holy magic. What I got was one of the best healer in the game. I was not a healer though and being Ret was my class fantasy. 
---
The holy knight, the mage-warrior. Spells, but also smacking with a big 2 handed weapon and big plate armor. I remember when I got my unstoppable force, finally an epic 2 handed weapon. I was not getting that from my raids. Why would I? I was a holy paladin. I was wearing cloth, leather and mail instead of my plate. I did not want to, but those items made my heals stronger. Yes, I was performing very well for myself, but I was not what I rolled paladin for. I was not smiting heretics with my hammer and holy light.
---
I tried doing Ret in BC, but, again, I was a holy paladin. I tried doing ret in Wotlk, but I was a holy paladin for my guild. I tried doing ret in Cata, but holy power pushed me away. I did not enjoy the rotation with holy power and played my rogue instead.
---
In Classic, I will be rolling a warrior. It is the second best thing to the fantasy I am looking for.
---
At one point, it was 420 days away.
---
you must be fun at parties, lol
---
Thats not even music .... thats something from hell
---
I would recommend you try Alliance then unless your heart is set on Shaman, *or* you have old friends rolling Horde. The leveling experience is fairly varied from Horde, and you'll meet nice people on both factions.
---
I get it. It's just not funny
---
[https://youtu.be/eupQ5Y8rv\_A](https://youtu.be/eupQ5Y8rv_A)
---
This is all I could find but I'm sure there's a better resource. It shows offensive and defensive channeling and cast.
---
I don’t think the beta gives a good representation for what the levels will be like. Everyone has had time to get “that perfect item” and KNOWS of its existence. The game is just easier because we have so much more information about the game now. You didn’t die because you are a better player than you were back then. I believe they call this heightened awareness. Your perception of what the game should be does not match your current skill, knowledge, or feelings versus your previous experiences. Everything will be ok :).
---
You should never ever ever be prot spec while leveling in vanilla. You can easily tank any dungeon in fury or arms. Maybe at 58 go tank if you Wana get the last two levels while working towards preraid bis.
---
It's going to take roughly 12-16 DAYS of GAME TIME if you play 5 chars while multiboxing. That is just leveling up time.
---
10 of them? probably upwards of 16-20 days.
---
Multiboxing will not be banned, it never was and it probably never will be banned so just 'deal with it'.
---
It's going to be great - this is the soft launch test and I hope as many people as possible try and log on in 6 hours.
---
Is life bigger than spending time on activities you like? Whether games, music, football etc it's much more fun than just working more than half your life away.
---
Same for me - dno what it is
---
Soul link...*vomits*
---
Not before phase 5 unfortunately it seems (and it's faaaar away)
---
Fuck yeah brother
---
RISE UP
---
Procs of WF add raw AP to their damage. It can still hit plenty hard as Ele and add burst if someone is close to you anyway. 
---
Also dagger WF is a thing. It is often more consistent. I would figure if you are fighting a caster where mana is an issue, WF with a dagger would add a ton of free damage.
---
Very surprised by that as well.
---
It's seeing the great mages that draws the "mouth-breathers" in. Because mages have *crazy* pvp utility, but not everyone uses it right.

---
Not really, don't plan on using more than 1-3 characters throughout classic so 3 names works perfect for me :]
---
It is the most satisfying PVE role in my opinion(though I have never maintanked). Healing requires more situational/positional awareness and resource management than dps and provides a much more varied and complex experience as a result.  You encounter unfamiliar and unexpected situations more often as a healer that you have to assess quickly and make calculated decisions on the fly.  I find that to be much more rewarding gameplay than mashing a dps rotation.
---
Meh, my vanilla server was heavily Alliance skewed but there were enough Horde to have a healthy economy etc., plus we counted for more of the top raiding guilds than the alliance.  What this led to was a small highly geared faction and a large poorly geared faction.  BG queues were non-existent and we won like 80% of AB/WSG even in random's.  Plus you got to know everyone which helped build an awesome server community.
---
Streamers will cry Stream Sniping no matter what. Any time they die they think it's a stream snipe. I was watching Swifty in Bags yesterday wondering why people were targeting him and "stream sniping him" when he was just out in the middle of WSG. 
---
Dude it's a BG there's only so many people they can target...
---
Plus they deserve any stream sniping they get, they are announcing where they are and what they're doing. If they don't like it don't roll PvP. Super easy.
---
I think 3 is 2 too many. Encourages trolling. If you really have a name in mind pick it. If you have 10 names in mind it becomes a bit trolly.
---
Used the color printer to print this at work.  Damn you're bold.
---
Any particular reason why? I've thought about rolling Priest or Shaman. Leaning towards Priest but interesting to see SO many more Shamans this time around.
---
I'd do it the other way.
---
Have a hidden option for "updated models", off by default.  People can find it and turn it on, but classic should at least default to classic appearances.
---
Be good at something that requires constant monitoring, but doesn't require constant input.
---
Really stressing the "be good" part, because if whatever you're passively monitoring suddenly needs active input, it probably requires immediate, *correct* input to avert disaster.
---
Seems to happen because of spell batching from what I read.
---
Consider that this all happens within the same batch window so all events occur simultaneously:
---
Priest is nearly dead. Priest begins to heal himself. Priest takes a hit that should kill him but he heals during the same batch window in which he should have died. Spirit of redemption triggers on the "death" that should have occurred, but the priest is still alive because the heal occurred simultaneously with his death during the batch window.
---
Priest is still alive but is also benefitting from and underlying effect of spirit of redemption which causes the spirit to be unkillable at 1hp.
---
Can't quit rogue, and I've tried. High pop or not, that's my class, possibly my only toon that'll ever get over 30 or so.
---
Its a toss up honestly.
---
I like the older models for some races/genders, I like the newer ones for others. (Old model fem tauren are fucking hideous, to name one.)
---
This is because most players on the Beta are *terrible* at PvP. I was watching people like Asmond dueling mages, priests, rogues, etc. and 99% of them were backpeddling noobs. The PvP skill level in the beta seems horrifically poor.
---
Sonii is an actual good PvPer playing against the absolute shittiest PvPers to ever touch this game, so of course he is going to steamroll them (no matter the class). Things are a LOT different on private servers where there are actual skilled PvPers everywhere. Warriors do a lot worse 1v1 in those environments where the skill level is more even.
---
My warrior is in this picture, on my cute white tiger that they won't add to classic :(
---
gief pre 1.4 mounts pls
---
Nothing wrong with human priests! Priests get a talent for allowing a % of mana regen during combat, so the 5% is kinda nice. Not gamebreaking, but nice.
---
Whats up with the universal remote?
---
I was able to restore my original account that got hacked and then banned, no problem.  I provided my old email associated to my account and name.  I also was asked details about some of my characters.  They were able to restore it.  
---
The person I spoke to was very nice, he said he will be playing on Classic as well ... lucky git has Beta access.
---
I was also told that I will not be able to use my original characters from Vanilla in Classic (I figured as much), but, just wanted everyone to know.
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond.  I like your way of thinking here this is great.
---
&gt; so we'll see.

Yea, see each other on the battlefield, traitor scum!

Ok dude. The fact you say it changes nothing and that they never fit in is on you. It didn’t divide any player base.
---
literally will take 10 seconds per name, so trying 100, less than 10 minutes.
---
And some people will corner the auction house, some people will cabal-camp rare herbs, some people will grief as much as they can within the rules on pvp servers, and someone will always cry about it.
---
Literally everyone has the opportunity, you're the one claiming it's 'assholeish', but it's simply planning ahead - anyone who cares about name availability could do the exact same thing on the same day of this hugely popular release.  I'm not trying to snipe streamer names or anything, just names I find cool.
---
Are you just salty you can't think ahead a few characters?
---
Its not that bad...but full arcane is pretty bad. Basically you dump enough points into arcane power and then put them elsewhere.
---
 Easy spellsteal when they have tons of buffs from all sorts of procs? No dude im sorry heal pallys were crazy op in wotlk aswell just go look up the top 20 of each realmpool and tell my why its 80% pallys on all pools. There were just so many good pallys playn in wotlk perhaps? Hell no.
---
Yeah the insect swarm cant be cast from moonkin aswell I thought, and nature grasp and focus were more or less a bit pvp/farming oriented aswell so I wouldnt have to switch as often, i know touch is the better spell but I agree that maybe wrath isnt as useless as I think!  Thanks for your reply ! I see how your first two are better for pure pve!
---
And the PvP skill level in the beta seems extremely low. Sonii is just tearing through these noobs, which is expected. Things would be very, very different on private servers if he was dueling against actual skilled players.
---
undead pala main here, i play retarbution.

Saving this comment
---
There wasn't in Vanilla, they were down with Druids as the bottom 2 unpopular classes. Maybe less popular class fantasy, plus they were very weak in early Vanilla patches. 
---
But now everyone knows how strong they are, especially in 1.12, so the population will be way higher.
---
&gt; avoid alt-itis and you'll be fine.
---
Don't tell me how to live my life!
---
Really hope this works, much more enjoyable to play with it...
---
Until you are on the bottom of dps for 3 wipes in a row... then toodaloo!
---
its the case for basically and mission critical job. I have a buddy who is a database engineer, who did all 34 tower artifact appearances while getting paid 45k a year on the night shift. Took literally 2 phone calls a night, but if he wasnt there, entire factories would shut down production in china.
---
Thanks for asking this! My sister expressed interest in picking up a prot pally for fun and the responses should be useful. I wish you luck in your prot adventures!
---
&gt;This post had absolutely nothing to do with multiboxing, stop making it your personal agenda.
---
He's talking about having a geared level 60 in every zone. So I brought up multiboxing to LEVEL characters in order to do that. 
---
Then I brought up leveling warlock alts. Why? So you can summon your one character to each zone. Making it not necessary to level up that many alts.
---
Im worried people wont even take the ret paladins who do more than the midrange
---
Yup, the very same.
---
Sounds incredibly immature and pathetic
---
Special class tokens available for $150 on wow store. ONly a few available tho so you need to get it quick...
---
well theres that
---
It's the same image, but it doesn't look way bright and washed out to you? I just grabbed my vanilla box and the Classic logo is way brighter and more overexposed than the box art, the 1.12 login screen, even the top of this subreddit.
---
Holy shit were almost up to 8b? STV PvP should be allowed irl
---
No, I just think any kind of unnecessary hoarding is being an asshole. Especially when the thing you are hoarding is quantifiably a zero sum limit.
---
Well people still don't know that shamans are limited to horde and paladins are limited to alliance in classic.
---
Just check the survey results man.

No it is because you felt the need to let us all know that you are different from us. Edgelord.
---
Are we supposed to laugh? I don’t get the point of the post. You’re being super serious and then acting like you’re kidding.
---
Or some constructive feedback.
---
Those meme specs are all fun and games until you continuously wipe and the try hards start posting the dps meter. 
---
Don’t get caught doing less dps than the tank.
---
It’s expensive brand new, but a Herman Miller Aeron is the best there is. For any activity sitting down
---
They are the hardest to level of all the classes, it's just that being hard to level isn't THAT big a deal. Do dungeons, play with friends, you'll get 60 sooner or later. The reward at the end is worth it for most.
---
Agreed. I'm waiting for this subreddit to be filled with salty people bitching about how aq40 is about to come out and they are still half blue and dont have anywhere near BiS. People are so used to retail. There is nothing to do in retail but raid or pvp. The end game is all there is in retail. People get this "bis" gear in heroic raids or lower end mythic plus. It's not actually their bis, but they still call it bis even though its 10 ilvls lower. I was a paladin in vanilla, killed Cthun, attuned to naxx, still had a blue shield, blue trinkets, and a blue ring. 
---
Classic is going to be fun, and I cant wait. I just wish people would chill out a bit lol. Play a character you like. It takes waaaay too long to lvl up. You dont need to be the best dps class to clear content. My guild raided nax in vanilla with only 2 fury warriors and one was 2hand fury (on alliance), 5 hunters, a ret pally, 4 or 5 locks, a feral druid, like a billion mages, and 4 rogues, and we still got to the 4 horsemen. You dont need to min max to raid. 
---
That being said I'm totally rolling a warrior. I'm going dwarf though. Humans are literally the absolute worst models in the game.
---
Ganking ppl is part of the game lmfao
---
Dunno how I forgot scarlet begonias but had no idea any of the others you mentioned were covers - especially ball and chain.
---
Good luck brother!  I will go for Burp, Gas, and Rump in your honor.
---
Damn! Sounds like a great experience!
---
If I may go off on a tangent, I rewatched Lord of the Rings not long ago and it made me realize how much I hate what they did with Gimli.
---
In the books he is noble and proper to the point of being a bit melodramatic. On more than one occasion he goes off on a monologue about things he finds beautiful.
---
In the movies he is pretty much 100% relegated to comic relief and just gets shit on practically any time he is on screen. Poor guy can't even get through a sentence talking about how gross his own race is without falling off of the horse he is sitting on.
---
None of those people will make it past vael or the trash in aq40
---
I stole mine from the boardroom at work while we were moving offices :D big, high backed, reclining executive chair.
---
Call me a thief but I'm a comfy thief.
---
Discussion? Your post is very one sided and leaves zero room for anyone else’s opinion.
---
Hey I'm not a hardcore raider but if it was my group, I would take a ret and if he does shit and we wipe, replace him. I would give him a shot though.

Sorry, but you can't really compare MMORPG and single player RPG. 
---
And nothing beats the Witcher and KOTOR games in terms of RPG imho.
---
Any tips on getting as much Darn rep as possible while lvling a human?
---
All the new animations are garbage. Orcs cant walk without stabbing their own face. Tauren run is so awful I cant even play it.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=17780](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17780)
---
Is this item not considered good as a pre-raid 1H?
---
I didn't say it divided any player base, I said it's the race that split people the most. Unlike all the other races, pandarians brought actual hate out in people.
---
This isnt allowed. How dare you
---
The point I'm trying to make is that warlocks are indeed fast as you say, but they do seem weaker from 1-10 compared to on private servers. 
---
I still belive that hunters are the fastest at any level. Their speed increasing impressively at level 10 but still being the fastest before level 10. Hunters often being the first to reach any level. 
---
The priest leveling experience with lesser and greater wand are indeed a comfortable one. I too find that people underestimate their speed.
---
Warlock is far superior on Orc. So if you're going for racials may as well roll an orc. You're already horde so you dont have to deal with wotf anyway, so that makes you pretty much even facing other warlocks and shadow priests. Your worst class is usually rogue and orc stun resist is already OP in general, but especially good against rogues
---
I definitely have a bias towards FedEx 1-10 route, (hopefully get to fine tune it a bit more today on stress test)
---
What's your opinion been on 1-10 in general between your beta experience, and the congestion that's come with the past 2 stress tests?
---
1-10 in 1:30 on repacks is fairly norm, 8 hours on congested pserver launches are also fairly norm. What's your 'hope for time', and what's your 'realistic expectations' time come launch?
---
This is empirical but one of my best preserved moments from vanilla was a orc warrior on my server with [Might of Menethil](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22798) absolutely shredding through anything that came his way. I should know, since i played alliance. I was just in awe about how he could tear down naxx geared druid in bear form in just a few hits.
---
Non hardcore guilds like to use dkp because it has less drama around it than a loot council. And they dont care as much if an item goes to someone who will get 5% less out of it. Main spec before off spec bid and reserve things like TF for tanks is about as drama free as you can get.
---
well more power to ya then, best of luck come august
---
I would recommend an arms spec where you take tactical mastery, anger management, imp overpower, impale, and sweeping strikes. Great for leveling, tanking, and pvp
---
Agreed. Those that make it to 40 should go all the way.
---
There will always be classic elitist tryhards.  This morning around 6am there weren't any tanks on and there were two groups with 3dps 1heals looking for a tank. I asked the other group if they had a shaman and they did. So I asked if they wanted to dual shaman tank and they said it probably wouldn't work but trying is better than standing around doing nothing. I told my group I was gonna drop and try with the other group. The mage in my group whispered me after I dropped and basically tried to tell me how stupid we were to think 2 shamans could tank a lvl 30 dungeon. 
---
Not only did we tank it, we cleared it extremely fast. You can 100% 4dps 1heal early level dungeons. This mage was being a classic elitist though, "BuT yOu GoT tO hAvE a TaNk!11!!" really dude? Some people just need to chill and understand everything they "know" on paper isn't completely accurate.
---
Agree.  To tell others how to live their life and how to enjoy their free playtime without any context, well thats just laziness and a lack of life experience.
---
Me: "It will literally run on any computer built in the past decade. I bet it will run 60fps on integrated graphics."
---
Everyone else: "But it's built on the legion client it's gonna be SHIT"
---
Me: "No it isn't... it's not using legion models, spell effects, etc etc and there has probably been improvements in client so it'll probably run beta"
---
Everyone else: "But look at legion"
---
Me: "..."

SoupaSoka: "All systems averaged above 60 FPS at 1080P low... Including the laptop without a dedicated GPU (it has an Intel HD Graphics 520 integrated GPU)"

Only viable choice is healer = not actually a hybrid class.
---
Lore yes, Aesthetic... also yes.
---
Damn your list has way more than mine! Mine only has like 12 realms!! Can't wait though! Been in all the other stress tests and loved every minute!
---
I agree with most of the ppl. Fun and games are cool until you get stuck at some boss. Nobody likes wiping so people will start blaming meme specs even if they are ok on DPS. The argument is that if you are this good with a "sub-optimal" spec imagine how much you can contribute playing a "best" spec for your class.
---
Lol. “I didn’t say it divided the players but it split people the most”
---
Whatever dude. If you’re upset over a race that’s been in the game longer than most then you need to get a grip. It’s a video game. Sorry you don’t like one of the original races being in the game.
---
&gt;If you tried to play **World of Warcraft** in a way where **all the classes and specs** were equally powerful in all situations, you'd suck every bit of fun out of it.
---
Good explanation of what happened to World of Warcraft.
---
5 mans sure. But no actual DPS class should be out damaged by a Paladin in a raid. I’m not saying don’t bring them. I’m saying have proper expectations of what they can do. Paladins are a hybrid class. There one role they do well is healing. Yes you could make a raid with 10 Ret paladins but you will not clear nearly as fast as a raid with 10 rogues or warriors as your melee DPS.
---
Welcome to capitalist society, where success is measured by how much money you get back from trading the best parts of your life away and nothing else.
---
I like the cut of your jib. You're doing something right if you value happiness over money.
---
What else is there to address.
---
You asked if the LC system is right for the game and I answered that its up to the level of professionalism of the guild and the game is not important.
---
You could make a 5 dollar mobile game guild more efficient with LC if you wanted to.
---
"In short unless i try bribe or suck to to the lootcouncil theres a big chance i wont get the item during the entirety of classic." 
---
The amount of drops doesnt change with the Lootstyle, so what you are saying is that the LC somehow managed to be much worse then a simple diceroll, I dont believe thats possible.
---
If everytime a much worse player then you got the loot its not the system thats at fault, its the guild and members of the LC.
---
Gandalf should be labelled family and his staff should be labelled wife.
---
Staff! You didnt take his staff!!
---
Just glad it will be up for 48 hours for us to level up and have fun in BGs and try to push some fun DM runs!
---
Of course it is. I've already had many occasions in the beta where I've reacted fast enough for an interrupt for example but still gotten killed from the spell.
---
I find that hard to believe. When I swittched my EU account's region on the launcher to Americas, it still doesn't let me download anything.
---
I HIGHLY doubt you can make a free US account and then download the client and enter with your EU account. It needs an active subscription after all.
---
Okay buddy
---
I like that he rants about play what you want... the min/mix I am better than you crap is annoying. I am behind Summit1G on this.
---
I get where you're coming from.  I still gotta do it.
---
I'm set on horde rogue. I'm debating on orc or undead female. I'm only going to PvP. I know there are people who hit r14 as both races, so I think at this point, which looks better in gear? Looking for any opinions (any input on race choice is welcome too).
---
I've been practicing my routes in classic for the past time - But as a Druid, I'm having trouble trying to decide how to tackle launch day, specifically at 10. At 10, I've swapped between heading to NW/SW Teldrassil and knocking out Ursal/Furbolg grinding, then Harpies/Mist (Panther escort), while the rest of the lvl 10s handle their class quest and leaves me pretty much uncontested to grind on precious mobs. 
---
After hitting 11.5, I can then head out and do my bear quest...But, this leaves me without Bear form at lvl 10/11, which is a huge DPS increase. The Druid quests are travel/summon lunclaw - so I can do this easy as the rest of the lvl 10s less practiced druids are doing it.
---
I can try pairing with a fellow NE - But that leaves me with only NE Hunters, as no one in my guild is rolling a NE War/Rogue (For min/max reasons). Pairing with a Hunter 0-10 has actually slowed my 0-10 time down compared to Solo as well.
---
How would you handle the 0-10 launch experience as a Druid? I'm worried about the flocks of people and how it will interrupt the normal experience. I can use tonight/tmrw to practice it, but wanted some input as well.
---
After 12.5 and Bear, I can hit up Darkshore till 16 - And from there meet up with my fellow human/dwarf/rogue Warr/Warlock/Mage/Rogue DPS class, where we will duo till 30-35 for the first marathon session. But this transition is leaving me feeling like I'll be left 1-2 levels behind the faster DPS classes to the point where I won't be able to sync up.
---
&gt;it's just that being hard to level isn't THAT big a deal
---
Never meant to imply it is.
---
Also there seem to have been improvements to Warrior leveling during classic, so it's likely much less cancer than it was when I tried it back then.
---
this meme format, we really are going back to 2005 choo choo!
---
dont forget the lube m8
---
Because my run at launch is a nelf hunter - do Teldrassil then Darkshore and get Cheetah before leaving for other areas. 
---
You can grind around 10-12 at Bashal’aran and at 18-20 at Mathystra. Those are the best spots
---
lol was coming here to comment this good to see it's the top comment haha
---
Elon Musk, Game of Thrones, Katana, H&amp;M bags
---
yup this guy is going in my cringe normie compilation
---
Not everyone likes to play undead.
---
So, tell me about your brackets
---
You shouldn't decide your class based on your friends. If you want to play priest, then play priest.
---
It's not like you'll need to be a BiS group for leveling anyways. Also, what happens if they decide to stop playing? Then you are stuck with a class you don't like?
---
5 man dungeons (Strat, Scholo, UBRS, LBRS) have an 8 piece blue quality set for each class
---
It's not really BIS before raiding, particularly because of the 1.12 itemization, but still good stuff depending on your class, and the nostalgia factor is super high
---
Isn't hating/loving specific guilds what WoW Classic is all about anyway?
---
Yeah, horrible system. Never ever are they objective or fair so you end up with a handful of people getting all the loot.
---
Found the over concerned person who kicks people from groups. 
---
I bet you floor it at red light even when the next light has a line of cars just ahead.
---
I'm glad hunters are so low.  I don't like fighting other hunters in BGs.  It feels like a waste of time and resources when I could be 2 shotting clothies.
---
Like many others, I don't like it and that alright but dayint pandas had no effect on wow and the community, is wrong. It's the race that brought the loudest uproar.
---
I also said I know it's Canon, that doesn't the fact that a ton of people never felt they fit in at all.
---
Im not upset, I'm just letting you know a lot of people didn't like pandas, even thought it is Canon and grounded deep in lore.
---
Rogue/HolyPaladin
---
So because some people like to eat blood sausage fast and you don't, they are not allowed to post some stuff regarding eating blood sausage fast on a blood sausage subreddit?
---
Is that where you're going? (Taking the comparison all the way)
---
It does, and the 1-30 maps marked with quest areas. 
---
Would love to hear how you go with stress test - I’m glad they gave everyone a bit more access
---
You just made me go dig up articles explaining why red shirts are actually less likely to die (as a percentage of population) than other colors...

GET UP, CMON GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS
---
I'm pretty sure there's going to be plenty of people who have been told that they have to play x y and z to play classic wow the right way that are going to hate their characters and give up in 3 months.
---
Let people play what they want to play. If you don't like meme specs then don't invite them to your group and enjoy your 100-or-nothing toxic environment. The rest of us will be having fun!

---
Stream sniping, lul.
---
Streamers are attention whores whose livelihood (and sense of self worth) depend on people watching them.  Their entire existence is screaming "LOOK AT ME!  LOOK AT ME!"  Then they complain when that's used against them.
---
Get a real job losers.
---
Friend should go ally, I'm rolling HotW druid (Tank/healer) and Ally is just the best for PvE hands down. 1% Dodge &gt; 5% health, Wisp form is nice QoL, Shadowmeld helps your stealthing early and frees up some points for Thick Hide if you want, closer to Gnomer for easier farming, Pally buffs work for you while Windfury does not, Teleport: Moonglade is so much better for traversal and just in general, also front flipping and better models.
---
For you, don't worry about gold farming. You can easily gold farm regardless of class/spec. Since you are a group you can do SM Farms for Crusader Orbs or make a full group at 60 for Strat Live runs where you reserve the first orb that drops in each run (If you supply the healer/tank this is usually the agreement). Plus priest can farm lashers in P2 with Holy Nova for quite a bit of money, so you will have options trust me.
---
I would play Paladin if I were you, no gear competition, still a monster healer, crazy fun utility, and amazing armor sets. Benefit of being strong as heck in PvP and free level 40 mount as well. If you are really deadset on solo farming gold, I'd say Hunter/Mage
---
What do you mean by pairing?  Two of a single class or just two classes that work well together?
---
Rogues pair best with other rogues or druids, though if you're open to classes without stealth there are some other really strong pairs out there, though how good they are really depends on what you primarily want to do with your friend (PvP, gold farming, instances, playing in the same group in guild raids, etc.).
---
yup,

I am going to be leveling a priest. I am trying to decide the alt that I will be leveling with friends, also of the 4 choices that I provided I know that I generally enjoy them all.
---
Gonna roll a human Paladin, I love the look of the tier 2 set but from my understanding it is not good at all for Hpallys and they will mostly be running with cloth. I'm debating between a male (Look best in the tier 2 imo) and a female (looks better in cloth). Just wanted suggestions.
---
Absolutely not. And while I do respect your opinion, I will upvote your post just because it really is an unpopular opinion.
---
That said, the only thing related to characters that I could remotely accept is simply more customization options, such as more faces (but still low-poly as original ones), more colors, and maybe some more hair styles (but nothing ridiculous like the ones we got in WoTLK).
---
Otherwise I LOVE the old models. Hell, I even remember the time when Tauren walked like drunk cowboys and when backpeddling speed was slower than a snail.
---
Undead for the hairstyles.
---
hunt(e)rs
---
Felpuppy and focus on CCing healers and drain their mana
---
I played in vanilla since the closed beta on my father's account.
---
Never reached max level until BC when I had my own account and PC.
---
No regrets, I loved every second of it.
---
I'm surprised warlock is so high, everyone has been writing how not very popular it is.
---
&gt; OTOH quests that give you skills not relevant to levelling may be a waste if they don’t marry with your route.
---
My paladin will likely not be doing Tome of Divinity at 12.
---
"Sorry random dead guy on the side of the road, I don't think paladins get a rez spell yet, maybe at 60? IDK, it's not at the trainer?!!?"
---
&gt;reserving names you might want in the future is pathetic.
---
Okay buddy.
---
100% true. Even though I never even had hope of running Naxx in Vanilla, the raid still made the game a little bit more fun for me. I still remember seeing a hunter wearing most of a full set of Cryptstalker armor and my mind was just blown. It adds a lot of mystique and excitement even if you never actually do it.
---
which class counters the warrior, because I want to pwn them ALLLL
---
The way I do it grinds early in the 40’s to ensure good quest flow 46-50. If you leave it to later the xp/hr grinding is a bit slower. 
---
We’re going to mark when to do dungeons if desired. It’s on the ‘get to it’ list
---
Ca(n) y(o)u exp(l)ain t(h)is?
---
Codyyy13 on twitch- the boar streamer.  Last I checked level 25, stuck between the rock and hard place of killing Bellygrub in redridge or going to RFK as a solo warrior and trying to pick off boars from the packs.
---
Judging by your magnifcent joke .. You must be too
---
Or stop streaming, no one is forcing them.
---
What's with the hyperbole? The only thing the old models have on the new are more distinct faces.
---
Depends on your spec. 
---
Soul Link - Felhunter no matter what. Self dispel and silence are very helpful. Plus Felhunter has massive resists which make it an annoyance for other casters. Felhunter also self-heals when it devours, which compensates for the 30% damage headed its way from Soul Link. You also get resistances from Master Demonologist. Win-Win-Win. 
---
Destruction - Succubus. If you look at the spells that Destruction casts, they are long cast time and heavy hitting, so you need the chain CC of the Succubus in order to control your opponent and get off your damage. Pyro+Immolate+Conflag with sufficient spell power will one shot (if I remember correctly).
---
Affliction is for leveling and shouldn't really be used in PvP (imho). Soul Link + Affliction minor gives you all you need from the Affliction tree with massive amounts of survivability.
---
I'd say go warlock this go-around. My reasoning is as follows:
---
\-good for solo play
---
\-wanted for group stuff, including raids/pvp/dungeons
---
\-easier to level than priest/druid imo
---
It might be nice to have something that's a little more in demand than a hunter for group activities, because being dps can be rough (by the time the group forms and is ready to go, you might need to leave). Being able to get into a group faster might make it easier for you to do things in the time you're given, and who doesn't want a warlock around?
---
People keep screaming "stay away from streamer servers!" but I'm just sitting over here hoping all the Pserver tryhard elitist jerks band together and join their own server.
---
They could be an option though.
---
If you close your eyes he sounds exactly like DSP
---
Rets are under the curve a bit but the utility they bring is also understated, especially if they have Blessing of Kings, who can pass up 10% to all stats?
---
Theonly reason you would have drops is because of the game waiting on network data to update. Which is what makes MMOs have lower FPS in the first place. Which is also basically impossible to remove. 
---
However yeah it would only happen in extremely busy locations like you said further down. Places with hundreds of players.
---
Personally I think picking a class around rotation is silly. By that same logic no one should play Mage/Warlock, as they are only one spell. You won't spend the majority of your time in raids and even if you do the difficulty isn't hard at all so having a fun rotation really doesn't matter. Just my opinion though, everyone has different preferences.
---
Paladin isn't the most engaging, sure, but you get a lot of fantasy, the best armor sets, great buffs/utility, and are pretty amazing in PvP/PvE. The healing rotation is just one part of it.
---
lets hope they add the addon 'Immersion' into classic WOW. Check it out if you aren't already using it have revolutionised my questions experience. no more walls of text.
---
Lol 20 virgins mad af
---
Beta has only given access to 40 so far and generally I expect you have the mount funds around 43, so I can’t say for sure until they increase the cap again. 
---
Gray drop rates are as per vanilla in quantity and vendor value so you will find your cash a bit tighter than you may be used to on pservers.

OH FUCK HERE COME THE MEMORIES

It's a quote from Groundhog Day you uncultured autist.

I have been going back and forth a ton these past couple of weeks. Generally, I always choose PVE servers in games. I just want to play the game and not have to deal with constantly dying to other people who, most likely, are way higher level than me and/or are better geared. But recently I have been thinking of rolling on a PVP server. I dont want to reach end game too fast, I want to suffer, I want to experience things I havent before. I just want to unlock another part of the game that could extend its lifespan to me and makes it more expansive.
---
So I am semi-set on playing on a PVP server. Now there is the fact of Horde vs Alliance. I always played ally. Following my own reasoning I set for choosing a PVP server, I should also pick Horde. I am really excited to play an undead shadow priest. Both in PVP and PVE I think I would really enjoy it.
---
The problem is my friend wants to play on a PVE server as Alliance. He played paladins from TBC all the way through Legion (and basically stopped since BFA is garbage). 
---
What do you think is the best way to convince him? Or what could be a solution for both of us to get what we want, to a certain extent at least?
---
What a dumbassed post.
---
LOL as expected, a bullshit answer.
---
crying in EU
---
You can do a loot concill and for Big item let people Roll..
---
That's the flexibilty of loot concil
---
Just how strong is will of the forsaken when combating fear? I do love fear
---
Tbh if you're playing a mega niche spec like that its up to you to theory-craft a viable strat, the 20 cookie cutter mages blowing your dps away aren't gonna have better insight than "pick a better dps class"
---
The best is when you find a tank that knows how to make the right pulls and mitigate damage all the while holding threat. Good tanks are truly the Quarterback of the WOW world.
---
It's so weird to me that so many people want to role undead over orc, but then I guess warlock does practically become unstoppable alongside spriest later on. Main classes orc seem best for pvp wise are warlock and probably rogue just because they're already strong against watlocks
---
Fascinating! I won't deny I still prefer 3.5 to 4e as well. My biggest annoyance is that they forgot every design lesson they learned from 4e, though - a lot of its strengths could have easily been incorporated into 5e, and they completely failed to do so. Thank you for the stats, I didn't have any hard numbers and now I do.
---
Don't forget Gorillaz and Demon Days.
---
Usually everyone, one corpse at a time
---
If you want the mounts go and do Teldrassil/Darkshore and Ashenvale quests before you outlevel them, as the rep gain diminishes when the quests go grey. 
---
Rep gain is about half what it is on pservers so quest XP will help
---
Make own raid and give yourself stuff? Who ever heard of that? Lootcouncil is completely uncorrupted.
---
Wasn’t it just shift loot?
---
How strong is will of the forsaken when combating fear? How much will it affect the warlocks ability to pvp?
---
Some leftover Olive Garden Chicken Alfredo :)
---
The females look really dope in tier 2 too, imo. I hate almost everything about the male humans though. I’d personally go female. Dwarf is another story though.
---
Also when you have nightshift and come home the wife and kids are asleep so you still can play more - it's what I am doing for classis lol
---
True, would be cool to have to dual pet dynamic
---
You think out of millions of players you are the only one that would reserve names?
---
Hahaha you might be right
---
There are no girls on the internet.
---
There's been an argument about how players seeing different models can cause disconnect. If I wear the same gear differently and I'm joking how bad it looks or how awesome it's presented on my race, players with updated models may see something entirely different and unrelatable. It's just another way to possibly break immersion.
---
it ok buddy
---
its only 48ish hours of awesome lol
---
Shamans have to heavily downrank to solve mana problems, so when you basically are using the lowest rank as your most recent version this kind of becomes impossible :(
---
Not being able to interrupt for 0.5% of your mana is killer.
---
you have to have an active account unfortunately
---
I agree w all of the above tbh, although I do prefer void over archmage lol
---
You’re meal planning a stress test? Jesus Christ.

Say it again.
---
Last question.  I'm assuming it includes human starting zone? :) thanks for all the replies!
---
There are a lot of young people that are neckbeards disguised by their prepubescent baby face, and undercut.
---
Based on the attendance at my LGS for MTG, 40k, and other shit; a lot of "kids these days" have that 2004 sensibility and are easily influenced by 20-30 somethings.
---
I'd have been fine with the new models being an option with the original models as a default....but in all honesty the new models are very unfaithful to the orginal, especially when it comes to humans (Males and their thousand-yard stare).
---
As an option, fine? Compulsory and the default? Nah.
---
sorry i'll rephrase the question so it's more kid friendly. what is your gaming fuel of choice?
---
listen, just because you want to roll a troll rogue female after you've maxed your troll rogue males since the hitboxes are thinner for pvp, doesn't mean you should.
---
It was a good riddle. But a horrible joke
---
I click on every add to enforce their behaviour.  (Just kidding I use ad block)

release is midnight GMT, which in the western hemisphere falls on Monday 26th.  Source: the globe.
---
I got a dxracer chair after having lower back issues with my office chair. The support, durability, and craftsmanship is great and it only set me back $250 shipped. 
---
I don't know ow if they are made in USA or not but their headquarters is in Michigan and warehouse in Ontario.
---
The frame is solid steel and has a lifetime warranty, 2 years on parts although their customer support is outstanding. I like how the back reclines nearly all the way down. The back goes well up to the top of my head and I'm 6'2". Arms rests have a lot of adjustability as well. I've fallen asleep it in a couple times laid back with my feet up on the desk. The come with detachable head and lumbar pads as well.
---
It's 6 years old now and looks brand new.
---
Obviously it's not going to compare to a $1000+ Herman Miller chair but for $250 I think it's the best chair you can buy new.
---
This is why I can't wait to check out classic. The same way I enjoyed the hell out of Old School Runescape. I will probably get to a point where I want to min/max after a couple months of play. But just going back and reliving the game is the best part of these types of re-releases.
---
Looks are subjective bruther. Which do you like better? Google a website that lets you view gear on races.
---
Ya know that's true. Everytime I picture the tier 2 it's on a human male but I just looked up the female model in it. Female it is, thanks!
---
Yeah daddy
---
Damn, that is absolutely legendary. &lt;3
---
No no no!  I wanted to play shaman to be different, are you saying I have to go druid now?
---
What does that have to do with hunter scaling?
---
Still a stupid question for this subreddit. 0/10 shitpost.
---
Stop
---
This
---
I’m going off of cloudy memory but this time around I’d go orc. Will of the Forsaken is nice but I think the 25% stun resist and blood fury are a lot more satisfying.
---
Not much, but you said that there was no changes
---
This ^^
---
don't start playing until after the reception.  that way you will not be seduced by the game.
---
HD models doesn't equal HD gear though.
---
I would say about 30-40% of people playing WoW in Vanilla never hit 60
---
I would outperform you and most anyone in whatever shitter welfare guild that would actually take you as a member.
---
Fine, if I need to clarify the obvious, duh others will do the same. I was wondering how common it would be.  Apparently not very.
---
just go 31/20 MS/enrage. if you're going to ever going to not do that, then it's 31/5/15 to be tankier. however, in like MC or BWL, we had MS warriors and they did just fine. they were offtanks. didn't really care about their dps.
---
OP is asking if blizzard is making any changes to hunter scaling. No - they are not. Reading is hard, eh?
---
It's okay to roll on different servers. I am rolling on a PvE realm this time, but my friend cannot imagine going for anything but a PvP server.
---
Priest and lock have gear overlap
---
PvP monsters 
---
PvE, not super useful
---
Balance can blow people up, easily, supposing you are able to stand 40yards from the fight, cast for about 6 seconds, and your Starfire happens to crit.
---
Kind of similar to else shaman.
---
Warstomp also does, and there's debate on whether windfury/sword proc should depending on the patch.
---
Now there is an actual option so you can simply loot and it will do it.

I am planning on maining druid (mostly HotW) throughout Classic, I can clear up some of these points.
---
MOST IMPORTANT: We are playing with 1.12 Feral Tank. This is nothing like release Feral back in 2004, we have gotten HEAVY buffs and are way better. Dire Bear used to only be 180% Armor gain for the first year of Vanilla, now we will be starting with 360% Armor gain which means we can easily hit the armor cap (75% dmg reduction)
---
Viability: Very viable, you can get some REALLY good Pre-Raid BiS items that a Warrior won't have and as a result will be very strong going into MC. The flip side is that you don't get much out of MC as opposed to a Warrior, so you will fall off as a main tank quite a bit going into BWL onwards. (I am not claiming Bear Tank is the OPTIMAL MC main tank, just that it is way more than VIABLE given gear at that state).
---
HotW finding groups: In dungeons you will be king. You can tank or heal, have great utility, and since warriors level slow (especially compared to druids) you will likely find tons of groups when you first hit 60. Finding a tank spot in raids might be hard due to public perception, but unless you are going for a top 1% guild you should be fine.
---
I'm going HotW phase 1, maybe phase 2, Swiftmend P3, then back to HotW from AQ onwards. HotW is NOT a main tank and never will be. You are a flexible healer that helps during fights that need extra tanks, the best decurse bot (really solid utility don't underrate this), and maybe an OT if your guild is running low on tanks. You really are a swiss army knife, but don't expect to be the MT in every raid.
---
The post kept getting auto-flagged as 'belong to the Looking for Group monday thread' (suuuure)  
---
So this is a way to bypass stupid bots
---
It's useful for tanking in dungeons too. You can quickly swap targets to put sunder armor on sheeped mobs between swings if you're careful. Since sunder doesn't do damage it doesn't disrupt the cc. That way you've got a head start on threat when it's time to dps that mob, or if it breaks free early it'll come to you instead of a healer.
---
evokes memories of tanking naxx as DK in wotlk
---
Well, only explanation I can think of is that I had access to previous stress tests too. Not going to sleep until I can try to log in one of those servers. RIP work day
---
You asked if anyone else was going to do it...
---
Don’t say duh when you’re the one that asked.
---
Led Zeppelin all the way baby.
---
I do want to PvP daggers so BF might be great. Good point.
---
Interestingly I'm going orc for the cooler caster animations (opinion) and stun res.  Low life troll zerking for 1second lesser healing waves is clutch, but stun resistance to help out against paladins / rogues is too clutch.
---
So you mean a normal dwarf female then?
---
Everything I"m hearing is that raids would want 1 shadow priest per raid.
---
Too bad with Layering we won't see this in actual Classic.
---
Blizzard is really screwing the pooch with this one.
---
Best thing about UD imo (female) is the melee animations where they do a flip. But it's a strong contender.
---
I know you’re a FedEx fan :)
---
1-10 in general has been excellent with layering. In particular you can note any quest that requires a static spawn almost all are ‘personal spawn’ and won’t have you waiting to loot. I missed the stress tests due to work, actually changing jobs to have launch access but that’s another story. 
---
Currently I get 1-10 2:00 and last few pserver launches about 3:30 for a bad run. I think Classic with layering and ‘personal spawn’ will expedite it to somewhere in between, maybe 2:30 or so.
---
Ahh I one of those "I will agree to make you shut up"! Gotcha mate.
---
Personal experience I started on a pve server back in actual classic. It was probably best since I came in a bit late and would have been relentlessly ganked. Now that you and your friend are, I assume, playing at launch PvP servers are the most fun choice. Even if you just level casually in the middle of the pack you will have more resistance to gankers than most people starting even a little bit later. I'd only recommend going PvE if you really only care about quests and chilling. If you want random epic battles to happen every day then go PvP server. You can still level pretty quickly and gankers mostly focus on hotspots like nesingwary camp in STV for one example. Avoid those places or travel in packs, or just die. That's a part of the fun, the inconvience factor is the fun sometimes.
---
Actually no i didn’t think it would be recent post
---
**FYI you cant cast Insect Swarm** in moonkin form in Vanilla, that change didnt come in till TBC.
---
Godly PvP
---
Good to have one in PvE to boost Warlock dps.
---
&gt; Ridiculous and it's hilarious that the people that want classic the most are the first ones to tear down anyone who chooses to play differently than them.
---
I liked your post until this bimbo-level line. Why are people so eager to think of every situation as a conflict between two distinct, homogeneous groups?
---
My only regret, is the inability to roll as a Tauren Rogue.
---
Blizzard, why have you forsaken us Tauren rogues?!
---
I think it would be better to make the vanilla characters HD and keep their defining features. Just to make it look more clean. I also think they should do this for all armor and weapons. Not changing, HD upscale only.
---
Careful, I voiced a similar opinion and got heavily downvoted. Don't think many "hardcore" posters here realise how painful it is compared to other classes.
---
So real talk, can we integrate it into a toilet?
---
Yeah in some encounters. Single target, that doesnt move, and you dont have to wear resist gear...you can be top. Depending on RNG, how many buffs you have compared to your mates, etc.
---
Personally I'm okay with people running whatever spec they want to use as long as it's not at a detriment to the group/raid.
---
If content is being cleared at a relatively decent pace then sure do whatever you want. But if one or several people are slowing down the group/raid too much or are the main factor causing wipes then I'm sorry, but you either respec to something more viable or find a different group to run with.
---
I get and understand the whole "I play for fun and spec how ever I want to". But when you're in a group/raid setting you are part of a team and sometimes that means changing things up in order for the team to be successful.
---
Wtf I remember just hearing it has reached 6 and 7M
---
Ok, and if I roll mage is there a significant difference between gnome and human? I’m aware of the overall intellect discrepancy due to the gnome racial but my only max level ever was a gnome and the gear was way too small for me lol
---
You gotta sub to play the test. I dont think you need BFA, just a sub.
---
You should play on a PvE server with your friend, and use Battlegrounds to scratch the PvP itch. If your friend doesn't like world PvP, it's going to be agony at launch for him. I'd rather play with my friends, then have hard feelings about wasted time on a PvP realm.
---
The funniest (ugliest) character I ever saw in vanilla was an orc female rogue with the pigtails. I think I have made my choice. That bitch was UGLY but my friends and I would laugh so each time we saw her. Thanks for the advice and bringing up a memory I had forgot.
---
Pay your sub for the month and you will get this 48 hours.
---
One of the devs that worked on vanilla specifically said that the population cap was a design choice, not a technical limitation of the servers.
---
I think it was either John Staats or Mark Kern in Esfand’s ClassiCast #13
---
Ya this is the spec I played with a naxx geared druid and was able to Starfire crit for over 4000. 
---
Very fun spec to play with a lot of tools in pvp.
---
Not really any tricks for tanking druid, just a heads up. It's really only for Feral Cat (power shifting). Feral tanks get the MCP, sure, but you maybe pop it once per boss and only at the start to increase your threat. Other than that they play pretty straightforward (Just maybe a couple more macros than a warrior)
---
That's actually really annoying. Going on your question, I THINK it would be a hunter. I was watching someone stream the other day saying that hunters were super powerful at lower levels for pvp but I'm not sure exactly what level bracket he was talking about.
---
Only thing Hunters can heal are their pets. Now IDK what youre talking about! 
---
Holy Pally is one of the best PvP healers, though.
---

---
Good PvP class.
---
Meh in a raid setting with only 1 being brought along to buff lock's damage.
---
God damnit. I was like now here is a guy that knows what's up. Then you tell alliance to fuck off. He had us in the first half I gotta admit.
---
Right for boss fights.
---
I mained lock so I'm not a warrior purist, although I do think I will run one this time around.
---
Aren't the models different in shape and size? And wouldn't that geometry affect how the gear is worn/scaled?
---
Are you Horde or Alliance?
---
This dude gets it.
---
Why? Blizzard is doing this to be kind to people. Not for people like you to act like absolute idiots.
---
People like you discust me.
---
This is exactly what I’ll be doing when I retire. Enjoy it sir!
---
Rockbiter + staff + Earthshock is realy OP at low levels.
---
You can kill mobs as you run by them full speed with kiting and jump turning.
---
My record on Private servers (flawed, but relative) is ~9 hours to level 20.
---
Thats one way to do it. Not a very smart way tbh
---
no because of melee "cleave" damage. It costs the raid more mana bc they now have to be healing 1 more target. 
---
This is why you must learn to down rank spells as moonkin. almost all Raid Boss fights are about how much sustained damage you can put out and not burst damage.
---
Wrong thread? Or trying to decide whether to play a warrior?
---
&gt; refuse to do anything with her and the kids for a week.
---
Jesus Christ sort yourself out mate. They are your children, wanting some time to yourself I get but demanded you have anything to do with your children for a week to play a game? Epic gamer move dude.
---
Technically? People would rather not have a resto druid tanking their dungeon.
---
Now you need the best deal... The Ikea "Jerker". Best product they ever discontinued.
---
Just curious though, if I reserved 20 total with the intent of trying them all to lvl10 at least, would that still be a dick move?  I'm literally doing that times two, which will be good if I find out a streamer rolled on one of my servers so I have an escape plan.
---
You generally use the term sausage fest to refer to a party/club/hangout with a very lopsided ratio of guys. It's weird and irrelevant as fuck to use it for a video game. You're literally just playing a virtual character anyway, it doesnt matter
---
Kings is in Prot tree and can be picked up as holy.
---
PVP god mode, PVE - bring one if you have a lot of warlocks. Otherwise "meh" dps.
---
I mean, play what you want, but troll warrior is unanimously the best TPS tank in the game according to Skarm Tank on youtube.
---
not enough peanut butter jelly time.
---
Playing as a warlock undead rogues were very formidable especially those who knew the perfect time when to pop will of the forsaken so the ability is very effective. I guess with warlocks the best thing is you have to kite the enemy around while keeping your DoTs up on them and throwing in a fear when you get the chance.
---
Honestly, you couldn't go wrong with either. Mage is really good at solo farming but it's not like warlocks suck. Both are great for pvp but I THINK warlocks need better gear to perform.
---
justgimmedalightsomepastdadro
---
Please read. I said bring them. Just don’t expect them to top DPS.
---
Go for a mage. Portals for your group, you guys can summon anyone with the warlock, you can farm at 60. Downside is you can't really group with a priest if you care about loot. (or if the priest does)
---
It isn’t that big a deal.  Running from a lock and surviving is tough.  You can dot them from like 36 yards away.  All they accomplish is dying a little farther away from you.  Curse of exhaustion also exists.  
---
You can also escape by fearing or death coiling and running away, just make sure you play horde lol.
---
It's p(r)onounced br(a)ckets.
---
That was a whole lot of text only to add nothing useful to the conversation.
---
&gt; Why wouldn't you try to help someone get better instead of getting pissed and kicking them out then going through another recruitment process? 
---
What makes you think I dont do this? I will always point someone in the right direction but that is not what we are talking about here.
---
Let me quote part of your previous post:
---
&gt; You can still be a really good player without all the stress of spending countless hours and gold on getting BiS and consumables for everything you do. 
---
If you want to raid with 39 other people you conform to the raid. It's that simple. If you are too lazy to get consumables or play to the best of your ability, then dont be surprised when the raid wont take kindly to your complete disregard of their time.
---
Can you be a good player without consumables? Obviously. But the gain in power from using the consumes are so massive in Vanilla that not using them is just lazy behaviour. This is a fact.
---
Alliance
---
Is fury better then?
---
This one hit hard... My pc couldnt handle Ironforge either, I had abysmal FPS inside, and during peak hours giant spikes in moving. No wonder everything took so long back then. Luckily I got a new pc during the middle of vanilla.
---
Sometimes I would play at my friends house and his dad had bought 2 new super powerful (by the standards back then) gaming PCs and running around ironforge with 40-80 FPS felt like playing another game.
---
Then do it!
---
Are you trolling? Killing someone repeatedly, unmotivated, with no personal gain is griefing.
---
First of all don’t worry about that feeling of being slow at launch, please trust me when I say you just follow your plan, albeit a bit more slowly, and you will finish ahead of anyone who has no plan or panics. 
---
Secondly be aware Bear DPS on Classic Beta is currently broken and about 30% lower than it should be. 
---
I would do Bear at 11.5. Often the dps increase isn’t worth dropping everything to go do it if you have a special trip. You also need to be I think 12 to get the sea creatures quest, and 13 to turn in Buzzbox with thresher eyes/accept Moonstalker fangs. If it really is a big fat increase then you could work out a plan to get it ASAP and resume levelling after. 
---
Don’t bother pairing up, guaranteed the other player will slow you down unless you train as a duo.
---
My understanding of furyprot tanking is that it is a late game thing. Prot until your raid starts throwing huge DPS and threat is an issue, then go furyprot. So it is certainly reasonable to think a tank can not respec for the first few phases at least.
---
That's just your having shitty loot council don't lame the system lmao.
---
The way you phrase makes it seem like you haven't actually used them? Most are extremely similar. I think HD orc has more hunch and HD tauren's backhair is a little different but other than they're mostly just more detailed.
---
Yeah I had definitely been leaning towards leveling pally with them, the bluffs and lack of gear competition sounds nice, thanks for your advice!
---
How healing works is the entire post...
---
It looks like exactly that in the picture
---
This was so wholesome right up until the end haha. XD
---
Haha
---
They exist, and Blizzard promotes multiboxing as a legitimate method of playing the game.
---
It is to a certain point. If faction imbalance is a huge problem then it sort of slowly destroys the game, rather than exists as some sort of integral part of it.
---
I think that's it, anyone who got previous stress test invites should be invited to this one as well, whether EU or not.
---
Didn't really seem like it at the time. Friends were yelling on teamspeak (or was it Ventrilo?) if I needed to move, and it was so fun, even if we wiped for the nth time.
---
Untrue. 1% Dodge is huge, way more important than 5% health. Wisp form is nice QoL. Teleport: Moonglade is actually useful since the Darn fp is only like a minute away and you don't need help getting to Kalimdor as Horde. Closer to Gnomer if you are a tank druid, Paladin buffs effect you whereas windfury doesn't (Healer will get Wisdom, Cat gets wisdom for powershifting, Bear gets kings/might). Plus better forms/models in general and front flipping (also you get a Nightsaber).
---
To be honest, the only benefits Tauren gives you is War Stomp (Really good, but not insane) and 5% health, but also gives you a massive hurtbox which is rough when kiting in PvP.
---
I’m sorry, but this is a shitty solution IMO... a lot of streamers solely stream for their income. That’s like telling someone to quit their job because they’re being harassed. Yeah it’s a solution, but improbable for most.
---
I see. What does 1.0 tier or .5 tier and how would I know which tier I have
---
That's true.
---
It's really not that bad leveling. And if you run dungeons you can makensure you're the only two clothies.
---
bro, that's so fucking specific.
---
It includes all Alliance start zones 👍 we also send out updates if you have the guide.
---
&gt; I can not work for it in any tangible way, i can only hope that SOMEHOW i aquire the favor of the lootcouncil.
---
If you can't trust your guild to distribute loot properly then the guild has bigger problems
---
Don't blame the system just because your guild has issues.
---
They have high threat too, don't they?
---
The attack speed is really nice though :c
---
Mage
---
I haven’t played WOW in 5+ years so I can’t comment on recent versions
---
In vanilla and TBC, there was never an issue (on my server) and it was by far the most fun part of the game
---
There is a reason 15 years later I still call it the greatest game ever created
---
Troll regen causes healer AOE threat. Its incredible. As far as leveling goes, it also allows you to move like 1 tick of eating faster per eat session. Also, berserking is amazing for when you have to kill more then one mob.
---
Should be added that when people SP is good in PVP they mean solo pvp. Shadowpriests are basically useless in premade pvp because a couple of dispells ooms them.
---
To me, the new models took wow into the Era of pleasing plebs and being as much like the next mmo as possible. They look similar to just about every other "run of the mill" Asian mmorpg.
---
The old models had some uniqueness about them, a uniqueness that was lost with the new models.
---
But hey, money is made in Asia, when it comes to gaming. There's no denying it, I'm just said to see it catered to so much. Especially by a company like blizzard. They aren't Tencent and should never strive to be, but yeh.
---
anyone else here, as in the small amt of people watching /new.  I know out of the millions of players others will do it.
---
I'm not sure. I didn't main one till Wrath
---
would've been perfect with the classic fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu face
---
A dwarf priest would be a similar and good experience.  Just go disc to level until 40, since wand specialization is probably better than the first 20 shadow talent points anyway.
---
and then there's healbot :s
---
This ain't TBC. We cant play as paladins.
---
Especially when mages go fire in aq+. Very mana thirsty spec
---
It's nearly impossible to get retail back on track. It would be a massive overhaul to all classes, which would push all of the existing customers away. They would need to make every class unique again, which would mean taking things away. Take away rogues heal, the hundreds of unnecessary silences and CCs to make each CC more important, etc.
---
A lot of what brings people to classic is the social aspect as well. They can't take away LFR, the queue systems, the instant teleports, dailies, huge catch up mechanics, and more. It just wouldn't happen, otherwise the current retail players would lose their shit. That and it's probably more profitable to just make a new game at that point.
---
Damn no worries thank you
---
Thank you :)
---
You can do that. For money.
---
Appriciate it 👍🏻
---
If I only did half of what bliz allowed, it'd probably be a full roster of characters I would actually play as an alt-o-haulic.  Is that so disgusting?  lordy you guys are sensitive babies.
---
Expansions are new content. You just contradicted yourself.
---
play now my lord

Thanks for the reminder. I'm one of those people who is looking forward to the journey way more than the end game. I find it pretty alarming that seemingly every guild looking for members since the announcement has been planning out their entire raid team &amp; schedule. Makes sense for those looking to power level and rush content, but trying to find a casual leveling/social guild seems impossible. I only bring that up because I remember back in vanilla, so many guilds were just groups of people having fun and not focusing on raiding at all.
---
Not pants? How many moneys?
---
What date?
---
Ensiferum/wintersun/dean martin/louis prima for this guy right here.
---
Orc for stun resist.  Undead rogues are gonna get mowed down by human rogue perception and night elf rogue improved stealth.
---
It's deflation, an addon does the work for you, and fixed losses are easier to swallow than random ones.
---
It's just banter.
---
right on, buddy. i had my list of good healers i'd always be PM'ing to heal for us. good healers and tanks were sometimes hard to come by.
---
Hi, /u/MadCXP

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2ik2r/is_it_true_that_warlocks_in_the_early_phases_are/). 
---
The stun resist was fucking annoying as a nelf rogue. I still remember it procing pretty often, looking back like 14 years later.
---
I like this attitude. And even if some thing have already been "figured out", there is still so much fun to be had in experimenting. Because even if someone else determined it was bad, I didn't, I sometimes gotta know why the hard way. And as long as I'm having fun in the process, that's all that matters. 
---
Let's group up OP :)
---
Shit I forgot about Avenged Sevenfold, gotta go update my Vanilla playlist.
---
pserver players will be the most toxic people on classic, not streamers or their fans.
---
Yes you can. It does cost money and each successive time you do it the cost increases. This is why it’s tough to PVE/PVP at the same time because eventually the respec cost gets up to 50gold.
---
Yes. You can reset your talents at any point for an increasing gold fee. It starts at 1g and goes all the way up to a max of 50g. It decays at a pretty slow rate per month. If you're a warrior and you want to tank + pvp, then expect to be paying the 50g respec cost quite a lot. If you just want to tank then respect once at 60 and then you may respec again every now and then as you get gear.
---
Youmean 1v1 monsters. No reason to take a shadow priest over a lock or mage in premades
---
Yes. Respec is available for a progressively increasing amount of gold, up to a max of 50g. Both at 60 and while leveling.
---
What utility do they bring that a holy pally doesn't?  Kings isnt one of the things, btw
---
I lucked out. Classic launches the day before my cake day. There is a tradition in my family. The week of your birthday, you can do what you want. I've already requested two weeks off for it months ago.
---
Not as bad as gnomes. They polluted their whole city.
---
Gotta admire his conviction, even is he is greenscum.
---
There have been private server that just failed miserably because of faction imbalance. They tried all sorts of things but it kept getting worse and worse. They finally gave alliance a 100% XP boost because it got as bad as 80-20 and they were getting murdered everywhere. Then everybody quit.
---
It depends a lot on what server you play. I don't remember it being that bad in vanilla, but I don't remember people being so hyper focused on PvP racials etc.
---
Depends on what role you are. If tanking, the 1% dodge is pretty considerable. Also you can't get windfury as Cat/Bear, so Paladin becomes way better for you in PvE and PvP. 
---
War Stomp is definitely strong as hell, but idk that's just one small addition in PvP. Compared to getting Wisdom ,which will heavily improve you since you can cast more, I think Ally barely pulls ahead. Depends if we are talking 1v1s or BGs though
---
Aka I wanna steal your bank alt names
---
Hey bro, MoP was when I quit too, for the same reason. I had close RL friends in vanilla/BC... then a tight nit guild for WoTLK and Cata. When I came back to MoP I played solo to 90 and then pretty quickly quit.
---
It doesn't matter how unbalanced the servers are when cross realms exist.
---
Every single one is like that LMAO
---
retailbad
---
I dunno, maybe it was the combination of everything being different in retail, but it just feels like nothing is the same too me in BFA.
---
What were going to play as a pair.
---
He was leaning warrior to tank, but we leveled a bit in 1.12.1 and he was very unhappy without heals. He was a top rogue back in the day so he might do that.
---
I cant decide between mage, hunter, rogue, warlock, or spriest (I healed enough between Wrath and Legion to never want to do it ever again). Lesni g towards mage because food, water, and portals are useful. But my first vanilla character was a tauren hunter and I had a lot of fun on him back in the day.
---
Yeah, I like them both :/.
---
Arcane has many good talents, the problem is you don’t really have a main nuke/spell to use as arcane blast first was introduced in tbc so the entire spec was mainly used for buffing the other 2.
---
You had arcane explosion which was used frequently in certain situations and arcane missiles which in all honesty is pretty damn useless and doesn’t even have niche uses that I know of. You could dump every single point in the arcane tree and would still do more damage casting fire or frost bolt rather than arcane missiles.
---
This was my gut feeling too. I feel like versus cloth in world PvP if I pick the right battle at the right time odds of losing are low (not zero). So great point.
---
I didn't even know there was raiding when I played in 05-07. Like literally I just wanted to get green gear that was slightly better than what I already had, and I kind of figured you just did that until you hit the level cap and then played in the battlegrounds.   
---
My buddy and I did a lot of just running through lower level instances with low level players that couldn't have finished it without us just to help them get cool gear, and then we'd just have dance parties in Stormwind.
---
I mean if you're taking a ret paladin vs a traditional DPS
---
Oh so now you’re trying to justify it? A little late for that.
---
RIP Chester.
---
Camping npcs *can* be an issue. The idea definitely works best if the npc is in a well-defended settlement.
---
And the npcs themselves could sell lootboxes. Small lootbox for 1. Big lootbox for 5. Have the big boxes contain more than 5 times the loot as the small ones.
---
/r/MurderedByWords
---
I mean in the context of taking a ret paladin vs a traditional DPS
---
Came here for this comment
---
Hunter may be best for you given the scope of play you have outlined. 
---
Your PVE ambitions align with Hunters peak strength (early raids tiers)  
---
Your levelling tolerance/ Playstyle correlates well with Hunter  
---
Your desire for solo play also correlates well, you can farm well and pursue solo goals  
---
I concede in PVP you may want to consider Warlock as they are the most potent of the three. 
---
Id say its between Hunter and Warlock, disregard Mage. 
---
Do you want to be immobile and cast OR mobile and shoot/melee? This is the real quesiton, if you cannot decide try out a private server.
---
Is that, Stop Breeding, Assholes!? or are you wanting to stop the flood of assholes who are being born?
---
Well as far as gear independence is concerned, scratch Warlock off of your list. While they're going to be a force in wPvP phase 1 regardless, due to a lack of pvp trinkets, their damage will be quite low. They scale excellently with gear, and take off around AQ40.
---
Mage and Hunter both fit what you're looking for, I'd say. Hunter will level easier with lesser gear, and overall quicker besides.
---
So fuck me, I guess you're right. I remembered druids and priests being harder to play against than paladins but it seems like Im in the minority. http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/168581-so-what-was-the-class-of-wotlk/
---
There was a poll taken on top classes throughout the expac by a lot of top players and it skews heavily towards paladins and warlocks with lots of people mentioning holy specifically. You win this time Nothingfunnysee.
---
are these rebroadcasts?
---
I've always named my bank alts banksta
---
This is accurate. You don’t need bfa for playing live classic either. Just a sub.
---
I want my classic gnome warrior to look like my classic gnome warrior.
---
Ohh I mean neither of us are going to have the slightest impact on what is going on. Gank away!
---
Going to be tough doing less dps than the fury tank that gets fed rage by getting hit.
---
The people on that sub are the losers who made WoW into Diablo 3.5. They would never play Classic because you actually have to try and don't get gear just for logging in
---
Lots
---
Xbank1, Xbank2, Xbank3... I think you can see where this is going? where X is the first 3 or 4 letters of my main's name. So I don't care about their names.
---
If only there were a WoW-related sub that was specifically created for discussing new content for Classic...
---
You and every other person on this sub.
---
Yup single right away and aoe a little before 30
---
Yeah?
---
Ret paladin:
---
Less DPS
---
More buffs, utility for rest of team
---
Rogue:
---
More DPS
---
Less utility, group buff
---
cheers I'll drink to that bro
---
Oh look, this thread again...
---
That’s not a thing.
---
Depends if ur watching Soni live or his videos. Videos and montages give an extremely false reality. It's the same reason people have this crazy idea that enhancement is this crazy PvP spec (its not), because unbreakable put the 5-10% of the fights where he 1 shot the player in the video. The other 90-95% is him most likely getting dicked on and kited, but they won't show you that.
---
But that being said, I never thought warriors were *that* bad. At low gear yeah they suck honestly, it's easy to kite them and they die fast. Once they get some gear and are durable, they can last a little bit through the CC and potentially 2-3 shot people anyways
---
Look buddy if someone is talking about what is viable in raids, then they are probably interesting in raiding okay?
---
Have you tried this or are you just assuming? I don't think it works that way.
---
I Will make you think of lazorchickens like furry mages sir, you have my word
---
I think I might end up with the same split I used to have in Wrath. Rogue and priest. I don't do a lot of raiding, so mostly casual PVP and 5-mans.
---
There are some pretty obvious times people are sniping. Saw one rogue find a streamer who was also in stealth in very hidden and random places several times during wsg. It kind of sucks for everyone since they'll know where people are, where the flag carrier is, when someone's attacking etc. World PvP they mostly put it on themselves but it becomes annoying in battlegrounds for everyone. It does suck that theres a bunch of kids seeking you out just to track your every movement and kill you no matter where you are, and it's fairly obvious who they are, but I don't think action should be taken against them if the streamer is choosing to put their screen on public display
---
loot council was epic for me when i raided hardcore us top 10 guild during ulduar/naxx I was always one of the top dps and always showed up.  I got almost every BIS piece when it dropped.
---
now that I'm older I wont be able to raid much and figure I'll get almost no gear from loot council :( not really playing classic for the gear perse but it might feel like doodoo going months w/o gear
---
If you are running a scholo, ubrs, etc then you can get away with the meme spec.
---
But this stuff won't work for end game raiding
---
Healbot is a good tool for teaching complete noobs to raid healing about downranking,  but it is purely reactive,  it cant predict incoming damage nor can it be relied upon to heal the correct targets at certain times.  Any healer relying solely on healbot is going to be very mediocre at best.
---
How is TBC and Wrath new content?
---
I'm saying there's reason to do so, yet everyone jumps to 'you're an asshole', assuming I'm just reserving names only to keep them from others?  Oh well.
---
I don't know if I'll main one char, or be an altoholic, or maybe try a bunch of alts 5 months from now.  If planning for those possibilities makes me an asshole, then whatever.
---
The ability to remove drinking or eating while grinding mobs makes a massive difference
---
I see a lot of people saying “one per raid”, but having one is only worth it if you have five or more locks, which is unlikely. Even if a shadow priest is brought, it will be a high ranking guild member aka an officer. If you’re confident you can reach that standing in a guild, go for it.
---
Yeah that could work.
---
it's something in classic they never really used, it had the potential for future use but they just scrapped it instead like most rpg elements.  u get the only languages available to you when you pick your race, the faction language and an additional racial language if your race's default language isn't the faction language.  so a dwarf only ever has dwarven and common and they're both maxed out at lvl 1.
---
&gt; remember most guilds could not kill rag. If you were wiping to rag you probably couldn't even clear the trash let alone kill a boss.
---
dude I remember doing the naxx beta, these p servers got kids heads fucked up bruh. We had a hard time with trash in the beta and everyone had full t2 with proper weapons.
---
The only thing I don't like about my dx racer is the armrests. Yes they are quite adjustable but they aren't very cushy and are not long enough either imo. Otherwise it's a great chair.
---
I'm not angry at all.
---
You made a post thinking you could teach people something about a thing that's been theorycrafted for YEARS.
---
Then, what a surprise, people checked your maths and discovered you knew fuck nothing about what you were talking about.
---
And just to be clear, since everyone here seems to miss ye olde vanilla days, back in vanilla days you would've been laughed hard out of ej forum.
---
They could revamp it a lot. They could kill off the old nerd who they trained to defeat. The boys could feel bad for him and attend an in game funeral, at which point a new antagonist, and even nerdier nerd comes and uses /rude all over the grave. The boys band together to honor the late nerd and defeat the new antagonist, who in the end, turns out to be Butters' alter ego, Prof. Chaos.
---
If you eat too many of em they act as a laxative
---
personal spawn being quest objects on the ground?
---
I’d rather go OOM and mana pot/ dark rune than stack MP5 as a DPS.
---
Oh.. you are sticking to Horde, eh? Missing out on those sweet, sweet Paladins!
---
soilwork, let the bodies hit the floor, old Foo Fighters
---
It is, but for some reason people think they're smart to suggest such a dumb solution. Dont like something annoying at your otherwise great job? Just quit and receive no income for who knows how long! So easy...
---
Thats not even funny. Its rude. This meme should know its place.
---
As a Feral off tank. I hope more people have this attitude.
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
I just don't get the whole "I need 40-100 names, just to be safe. I really need it, I do. Just because".
---
Changes are, you won't be playing 95% of your characters, 6 months after launch. But you will have names, just to have. Names others could put to way way better use. Just because you can.
---
It doesn’t matter what your reason for doing it is, the result is the same. You *are* keeping names for others.
---
I did some research on it.  There was a mission with Furbolgs that sorta played it out like I remembered.  Maybe it was something they were promising, but they did have the mechanic in play.
---
Yeah, it was never actually in production, but the ability to learn other languages was intended to be a thing during stages of development before they made the decision to disallow cross-faction talking due to griefing. The language skills were a holdover from that.
---
Feral druid is a monster, if you have some half decent gear with strength and agility.
---
I never understood how people played with names/guilds over peoples heads like that.  What a fucking mess.
---
It's sad that you have to come to the internet ask a stupid question to come to the realization that you're just an idiotic douchebag.  
---
Best part is where everyone is telling you you're a douchebag and you still dont get it...
---
Yeah no problem man, my good friend and I are leveling Druid/Paladin ourselves. Paladin would be my second choice of characters if he wasn't playing it, easily the most immersive of all the classes (Except maybe Druid)
---
Bankandspank
---
&gt; PvP-wise, Shadow Priests are amazing, not much to talk about there.   
---
Unless you're alliance.    
---
People who repeat the PvP meme never played one in **vanilla**. They're good duelists and strong against certain classes (healers, mages, boonkin, non-geared warriors, destro locks). But they have little CC (single fear on a long cooldown, that everyone counters, particularly UD/WotF), no escape, and cannot heal. PW:S has a long debuff and is expensive.       
---
In organized/group PvP you're frankly better off with a Mage (better CC/escape, burst rather than ticks), or Destro Lock (fear spam) for DPS or a Disc Priest for healbot/off-damage (more survivable, reasonable Holy/Shadow damage, auto-healing even while stunned via Blessed Recovery, etc).     
---
A Shadow Priest is a lot like a Warrior in classic, both get locked down easily and often. The only difference is that a Warrior turns into a Greek god when geared, whereas a Shadow Priest always remains meh.   
---
But by all means go roll a Shadow Priest and PvP. Bring bombs, you'll need them.
---
You might see a highly skilled player out dpsing the bad players but overall Ret pallies don't do good dps.
---
I only ever play as the good guys in video games.
---
Every time I've seen a "shadow priest" they were specced just for the debuff and mostly just healed.
---
Yeah those names are not gonna be allowed
---
You say that as if streaming is a real job. Nobody else gets to warp the world to keep their income stream, if reality makes it impossible for the way you want to earn to work, you adapt, you don't cry.
---
You could get draconic language during Vanilla, nothing else. This features was here but not really usefull
---
The server reacted just as fast as you. Spell Batching allows for a window where other spells are processed in the same "batch" of spells.  
---
If you were at the end of this batch window, you would think the opposite: that the server reacted insanely fast.  If you're at the start, you might think that the server is slow as fuck with processing your spells
---
Thanks for this write up - really informative!
---
My main goal is to be able to find groups easily - I only have a few hours to play each night and can't waste much time finding groups. It sounds like I should have no trouble finding groups for tanking dungeons, and will have a viable enough spec to heal raids through phase one and two.
---
Question, why back to HotW from AQ onwards, better scaling?
---
The people who play shit specs are usually stupid and do low dps because they click their abilities and they can't find them.
---
Fury tanking is a viable method of increasing threat generation to hold aggro. You can even fury tank in 40 man raids once you get some gear.
---
Don't worry guys. My dad works for blizzard I will tell him and get the names back.
---
I was a fucking god with the chainsaw for some stealth into boost kills. Great times.
---
Bingo lol
---
Yes so Emerald Dreamcatcher, the chests in Barrow for Relics of Wakening all have no issue looting immediately.   Items like lilies in Teldrassil do need to respawn but it’s very quick, 10 seconds or so.
---
Yes, vanilla CE owners get thier pets
---
All the good names will be taken on august 13th, so good luck with that
---
It's actually not learning. it's making a bunch of incorrect assumptions that we want to play garbage ass games and never adjusting. That's the unfortunate part.
---
&gt; i've heard that the debuff limit will be 16 as it was previously 
---
really? they, rightfully, took that out of vanilla very early on.
---
shadow priests were monsters in PvP. i would pick others over them for raid spots, though.
---
Going by this classic would probably be rogue one then
---
So many people saying they're going to play Shaman are going to quit so fast while leveling, especially if they try earthbind kiting but have no actual clue how to play the class.
---
Tupperware
---
The first 60 I raided on was a druid.  It's an OK healer, doesn't compare to priest or pally by a long shot, but does bring some different utility.  The most fun I had on my druid was in WSG being a badass flag carrier, I was literally unstoppable.
---
couldn't you just download more ram?
---
well guess I'll delete it, thanks for the negativity bud
---
chad pure classes vs virgin hybrids
---
I expect some of those names to be taken, which is why I will have a longer list beforehand.  Chances are I will be playing at least 5 or 6 of them, as I'll level a bunch on rested XP and I'm not sure which classes they'll be yet.  I'll definitely have a number of chars at 35 as crafting alts.
---
Maybe I'll end up deleting those I find I don't need in the end, who knows?  Didn't know I needed to elaborately justify why I might want a large roster of chars made day1.
---
rogue one was the only new one i really liked, so i can accept that
---
Depends on what a "little longer" is.
---
Are you going 4+ hours and not clearing the raid?
---
Yeah I've never heard of someone suggesting war stomp isn't used a lot.
---
It's strong AF
---
That’s not what you said at first. Your original intentions was just to take up as many names as you could. 
---
Then when you got backlash you suddenly had justified reasons for being rude.
---
:D it's the truth
---
Lol. It does matter when u are level 30+ in a pvp server.. even in a 2:1 server you'l die  10 times before getting near the DM entrance. cant imagine in servers that are 90% in favor of one faction.
---
Vanilla wow is dramatically better than BC and Wrath. Sucks that people keep putting it in with those 2
---
Also MoP is better than legion and bfa
---
Get better tanks.  Windfury totem beats all.
---
&gt; but having one is only worth it if you have five or more locks    
---
People repeating this doesn't make it any more accurate. The five locks thing is based on a Shadow Priest doing 0 DPS and 0 HPS which is silly. Essentially they cast Shadow Weaving and go afk.    
---
When you account for a Shadow Priest's own DPS (1/3~ of top tier) and the VE healing for their party (which given AE splash is not insignificant) it is closer to three Warlocks.    
---
The real question is if you even want three Warlocks with how poorly they scale in Classic.
---
Two weeks off, bring it on VANILLA!!!
---
It's weird because in BGs alliance have the advantage with a 2nd dispeller (paladin), whereas horde only have priests.  The other thing is that WOTF can break one fear but orc's can resist 25% of stuns and in my opinion rogues are probably the worst matchup for warlocks, so that 25% is way more important than breaking one fear.
---
But I've never played either, so who knows.
---
Pretty sure they've already said you can only reserve 3 characters.
---
They don't *deserve* to be protected from the consequences of their actions. They are CHOOSING to broadcast to the entire world, where they are and what they are doing.
---
This is like you playing poker with Player A. And player A is intentionally playing with their hand exposed. And then someone calls YOU a cheater and that you should be banned for looking.
---
It doesn't matter what their income is. They shouldn't get special privileges or protection. They should suck it up and deal with the consequences of what they *are choosing to do*.
---
Go Dwarf Spriest for stoneform and Paladino support/cleanse to deal with pesky hunter stings.
---
It's surprising how evenly split EU/US is.
---
hamstring kiting in PvE? why even bother. just use that rage for damage.
---
I will say that WoD whatever its flaws had some of the best raids ever developed.
---
Why are there so few druids?
---
What classes do and dont have legendarys to pursue during vanilla?
---
You don't want, you can have 1 but no more and it's for a buff to increase lock dps. You'd be better off with another lock or mage.
---
Hunters are in a similar spot but you need 1 to 2 hunters because of trueshot aura.
---
Rofl. Chill out.
---
Don't take everything on the internet so literally.
---
Mop was the best expansion from a PvP perspective don't @ me
---
You can't learn other languages. They added a glyph at some point that allowed mages to understand all languages of your faction through arcane intellect, but that wasn't added until Cata (I think). As far as cross faction language, forsaken were able to speak and understand common as they were just undead humans. That got patched out sometime in Classic though for obvious reasons. Other than that, it is possible to translate cross faction on a very basic level. This can either be done by understanding the other faction (Horde yelling "kek" or Alliance yelling "bur" meaning "lol" when seen by the other faction) or by a player typing gibberish on his side to make a legible but basic sentence for the other faction. There was an entire wiki page for it that can go into it more, but that's about the extent of languages go in wow.
---
This.  You can go into a raid with all the buffs in the game and you will die if you don’t know what you’re doing.
---
The Nightfall bitch instead of a warrior (who would do more dps than the ret)
---
I've got one of those $1,000 mesh steelcase chairs at home. Honestly, it's just okay. It weighs a ton and it's built to last... But it's not crazy comfortable.
---
What is there to discuss?  
---
Loot council is a valid loot distribution system, as per its design you trust a number of people to know whats best for the entire guild and distributes loot accordingly.  
---
If you do not agree with such a system dont join a guild that follows that model. Simple as that... 
---
I raided in Vanilla with such a system. Got dicked sometimes. Eventually got promoted to Class Leader and then Officer and got the reverse side of having to chose people who to give loot to. 
---
Its all about managing expectations... going in to the raids i already knew what was going to who and the people raiding pretty much also knew. It wasnt a secret or something decided on the moment. 
---
If you have good people on the loot council who actually do the work its required its a great system.
---
99% of my memories of vanilla are from raiding or end game content - because that's where my community was. Getting to max level quickly is the best way for me to re-live those moments. Also I searched for xXxGodOfWar's LEVELING AND DPS GUIDE and it doesn't exist, so idk how much fun it'll be anyway. Dude must be new.
---
Europe has fewer healers of every category, I wonder if there's a cultural reason for that?
---
Many people will skip over a listing posted by a character with “bank” or something similar in their name and instead buy from a slightly more expensive seller
---
6 and 7 million? Damn, that's a long time ago compared to the almost 8 billion there is today.
---
solo was ok
---
Pretty sad in wpvp and Real bgs though.
---
5 seconds
---
So we will never be short of tanks during the leveling process with that many warriors, right? Right?
---
....
---
Tell the to Knights of the Old Republic
---
Wpvp they do fine in 
---
depending on how one defines it
---
I have legit reasons for wanting 15 or more characters, even up to 30, explained in other comments if you care.  I didn't realize most people would jump to assume I have bad intentions in doing so.  I think everyone telling me the same things you are sensitive gatekeepers of playstyle, so I don't think much of it honestly.  Was enlightening for sure.
---
So because I never watcher a movie I'm an autist? What is wrong with you dude.
---
I mean of the original trilogy: most beloved, best development, coolest but disappointing; more or less fits.
---
I'd personally put MoP between the two, despite how great ToT was.
---
I agree. Some friends and I used to camp the great wall of china pvp vendors and gank people. Also the pvp on timeless isle was fantastic.
---
If you are serious about ranking in PvP you should probably be 31/20/0 for MS. If you are serious about Tanking/DPS in raids you should probably be Prot/Fury. If you want to be serious about doing both at the same time, you should probably quit your job, leave your serious relationships, and get ready to farm 100g+ a week to cover respec costs alone. I'm actually not kidding. 
---
My advice? Just pick one and casually do the other. It's masochistic to raid hardcore and rank in PvP at the same time.
---
Classic warlock tactic to throw off the unworthy.
---
Bruh it's just for the first few weeks. Unwad ur panties
---
Ok, so that's 10-15 chars out of the 40-100, on that one server. Then you got 10+ other servers with the same 40-100 characters, sitting and waiting.
---
It just seems way overkill and a great waste of time and energy. But it's your time and energy, so that's your call.
---
I just don't get it.
---
I'm surprised Horde hunters are in the same ballpark.

Exactly what will you be doing at current beta level cap that you wouldn’t be doing leveling to that point? It honestly sounds like you believe the beta exists for our enjoyment, it does not.  The reason the level cap exists in beta to begin with is to focus testing on those levels.  There are plenty of people testing at current level cap. 
---
I’ll be honest, this post doesn’t come off being very serious about testing the game like we are supposed to be testing it. If that really is the case then what I’m about to say isn’t personal but I really wish someone with more focus on what we are supposed to be doing got the beta invite rather than you.
---
Ruining into duskwood way under level and realizing you made a huge mistake.
---
So ... Imp?

a blue orc aka blauknecht
---
BGs are more than just group fights. Pvp is more than just group fights. 
---
The fact you think people won’t want rogues because they are only good 1v1 and not team fights makes me laugh.
---
PVP was at a really great state in MoP, I agree 100%. And, while i never did it because I could actually gear in meaningful gear through Arena, Throne of Thunder was apparently a bad ass raid.
---
If none of the holy paladins have Kings? I mean maybe. Let the Ret pick up imp Ret Aura and Kings. 
---
Not saying you can’t make room for one. Just saying even if you do their DPS will never be as high as a warrior or rogue. 
---
Between that and any bonus they can bring to the raid can be done with a holy paladin specing for it. One holy picks up Kings, another grabs Imp Ret Aura in their holy builds and the Ret is bringing nothing but his sub optimal DPS.
---
I full on plan on letting off meta specs raid on our squad but as long as we have numbers to fully fill the raid. Those raid spots will probably got to non meme speced players on progression nights.
---
I know you don't recommend skinning for outright speedrunning, but is it useful for getting the mount earlier? I've heard that so many grays drop in beta that there's no room in bags for leather anyway so it makes you no money.
---
I still play WOTLK on pservers
---
There were definitely blackout stun procs in this video. It procced a lot.
---
My uncle works for activision and will fire ur dad.
---
It's perfectly legal. You're playing on accounts that you are paying for, and giving inputs to the characters (so it's not botting), only simultaneously.
---
This meme format is almost as old as Classic itself.
---
Death knights originally were paladins that had been taken over by the scourge/the lich king in lore, so theoretically only Dwarves and Humans would have the potential of ending up as death knights, but blizzard shit all over this lore aspect in WotLK when they allowed every race to be DKs, when it should have only been the races that were paladins in Vanilla.
---
&gt; In particular you can note any quest that requires a static spawn almost all are ‘personal spawn’ and won’t have you waiting to loot
---
I recently saw that, and revamped my plan. Emerald Dreamcatcher, Milly's harvest, Refugee's Quandary, Tundra MacGrann's Stolen Stash, Iverron's Antidote... should be fun to implement.
---
Jesus fuck my dudes, get adblock.

oh, Agility doesnt even offer AP in bear form?
---
It's more of a toss up for me, who is planning to be a warlock.  Can't decide between orc/UD.  Wish I could be a troll though, I'd be a troll even if they had no racials.
---
in my country (roman empire) we use a sponge on a stick
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylospongium
---
I know what to play, but I don't know where.
---
I want to play NE Rogue, but I can't decide if I should stay in Teldrassil/Darkshore/Ashenvale or, as soon as I'm done with Shadowglen, should I just go to Elwynn Forest.
---
On one hand, Taldrassil is the "correct" route, there's a quest chain that takes you all over the place, there's a lot of NE lore in Darkshore/Ashenvale, etc.
---
On the other hand, you get sent to Redrige as part of the Pick Lock quest anyway, and all further Rogue quests are in Stormwind. Sword weapon trainer is in Swordwind too. Plus the human zones are most detailed I feel, and are more "compact" and later you can easily bounce between Redridge/Duskwood doing quests, etc.
---
On the other *other* hand, human zones are always contested as fuck, and I feel it's like "sequence breaking" to go there as soon as I can...
---
No it's not. That's not the definition of griefing at all.
---
Killing someone repeatedly and corpse camping them isn't a violation of the ToS and there's even a specific clause in Blizzards ToS that directly touches on this.
---
Griefing is like blocking players from completing a quest because you're blocking a doorway from consuming a bunch of pots on a Tauren and stopping anyone from entering.
---
PvP combat is NOT and never has been griefing.
---
Either you're trolling or you're uneducated on what griefing actually entails.
---
I dont know enhancement shammy may be worse lol
---
I don't think it had better raids, but I loved the shit out of leveling through it.
---
I would say dwarf is better.
---
I’d roll human female.
---
The only reason they’re the ‘original trilogy’ is because people like the number 3 and want it to be so. BC invented flying and wrath added dungeon finder, they don’t deserve to share the stage with vanilla.
---
str &gt; agi &gt; stam
---
If thats all you think goes into being a mage/raider, i think we found out why you dont like the council approach
---
Probably going alliance rogue, is human far and away the best race for it? PvE primarily
---
Ah what if I want to do both??
---
Managed to get Asmongold once, it wasn't funny or original though.
---
For the Horde!
---
BFA BAD CLASSIC GOOD LOL.  
---
This was a shitpost
---
Mage and Warlock gameplay differs in 5 mans versus raids. Holy Pallies are pretty similar, which is why I levied criticism towards them. A more versatile healer kit is more engaging in PvE regardless of what content you're doing.
---
Loot council in many guilds will be absolutely abused and the best loot will only be given out to people in the inner circlejerk. There’s going to be a lot of drama and rage about it. Especially streamer guilds with loot councils that will funnel all the best shit to the streamer even tho his performance is far below that of others. Can’t wait.
---
On my server I remember alliance greatly outnumbering horde, but i stopped playing after wrath
---
do you do stonetalon mountains when you're in ashenvale? there's a quest called gerenzo's orders which is an event in a cave in windshear crag, it's bugged on mostly all private servers, would like to know how it works on the classic beta and if it's possible to solo, it's a huge chunk of exp with the followup too
---
Gear in P3 is still somewhat meh for druids and amazing for Warriors, so you'll get less and less powerful in that phase. Drakefire Talisman is AMAZING for tank druid, but hard to get as it is sought after by Rogues, so even getting your gear that phase isn't too easy.
---
When AQ rolls around you start using HotW in a better way. P3 and lower is mostly you healing or tanking with minimal switching. AQ gives you fights to switch for, like Three Bugs or Twin Emps (Also 4 Horseman in Naxx). It also gives us gear with good itemization which is huge for us coming out of P3. 
---
The strength of HotW early comes from the Intellect being amazing since there's not much +Healing gear and the fact that Warriors level slow so you can find 5 man groups easily. You are pretty much all of a Bear tank except for Omen of Clarity so you get flexibility. As your gear goes down (i.e. no good upgrades left) you lost the flexibility of being the tank as you'll need to max your talents to really keep up. That pushes me to want to do Swiftmend, as it's virtually the same in PvP (better honestly, after we get good mana/sp items). If you aren't able to get use out of being a tank AND healer, there's no point in the spec. Once you have farmed your 5 mans and warriors get T2, you won't be as good. AQ40 gives you an opportunity to shine as you can now fill a flexible role for the group, same for Naxx.
---
You take issue with the game of thrones book and not Dawkins? I'm not about anti-intellectualism, but it seems a little tryhard given the rest of the ensemble...
---
I played a priest in vanilla, but I want to do something different this time.  Except my friend is going mage, and I generally only enjoy casters in WoW.  So it basically made up my mind for me.
---
you used to be able to shout or say individual letters with spaces for a short time. like F U C K Y O U. they took that out but you could still do the phrases that translate into stuff like "i luv u ruff".
---
Everyone's allowed their own opinion but I disagree. Personally I hate the new models, I think they all look like a character from wallace &amp; gromet and the run animations are horrible (same for mount run animations). To take it further,  I also massively prefer the old cast animations and old spell models (e.g. old pyroblast looked and felt "heavy" like a big massive ability, whereas today it feels "light" in the way it's casted and doesn't feel right). 
---
I also think that if you start allowing small changes, people will keep asking for more and more shit, it's easier to just say (pretty much) no changes, rather than saying what should be changed and what shouldn't.
---
Again, you still dont get it, there is no legit reason in any way shape or form to want to reserve 100 names over all servers.
---
You cant make more than 50 chars as noted by others in the thread.  I also said if a big streamer joins one of my servers I will jump off that srv if its early enough (and hell, since everyone is crying I'll delete those chars which I likely would have done anyways), and then I'll have another srv with names I like instead of 1 week later having them all taken.
---
So sure I'm hording initially, but it's quite difficult to get names later in an MMO as large as this and I've been burned in the past by that, so I'm preventing that for myself.  If bliz saw this as a problem there are a number of solutions they could implement.
---
Anyways, thanks for engaging in this thread turned crazy lol.
---
no reason for the horde. alliance needs the dispel.
---
I think you'll be blown away at how much more effective you'll be in Warr (or any class) after 15 years of experience and retrospective. Even if you haven't played WoW since then, if you've been an avid gamer in any context of the word, you'll probably play better than you did at the time.
---
My first month or so playing WoW that was close to my experience.  I think I had 256 mb of Rambus RAM in the PC I was using, at a time when Rambus was already all but dead.  Going from Org to Tirisfal, I'd often load in when the zep had already gone to the tower, and was just about to hit the load barrier again to go back to the Org.  I'd have to jump off the zep to my death in order to be on the continent I wanted to be on.  My dad and I had to hunt down 1GB of overpriced ram at a small mom &amp; pop shop to fix the issue.
---
I also had an abysmal GPU, and couldn't see the sky properly for my first few months playing. If I looked up the skybox would just be pink and there was screen tearing and all sorts of visual bugs.
---
Fuck that attitude you Horde scum. You go be a Feral Main Tank.
---
A valid opinion but, they are trying to keep the game as close as possible to the original. If you have the character models to modern level of detail. Then you need to keep all the npc, bosses, and so on to the new level of detail. Then taking away from the look, and feel that is Classic.
---
See this is the conundrum I face as well.
---
Hunter seems like the obvious choice, but I also dont want to always be fighting for raid spots with other DPS. The other thing is as you mentioned, Warlock is better in PvP. Also, the whole pet maintenance, deadzone thing is something to be considered for quality of life.
---
I like the quality of life of Warlock more, but I am concerned about Warlock gear dependence - not looking to be amazing or the best but also dont want to be trampled because im only going to probably be in blues?
---
well he's not a sheep ... that's a good thing imo
---
Starting school in August 😭
---
You want 3 warlocks because there are exactly 3 useful debuff curses.
---
Dont have regular priests?
---
Ofc it will. Classic ain't Vanilla and it isn't 2005 anymore.
---
I feel like there was a mace that let you speak dwarf for 10 seconds, regardless of your character race.
---
That's correct, only in cat form. Agility *does* increase your armor, dodge, and crit, so it's not a total loss. Grab stamina agility pieces, and prioritize stam+agility+ Strength gear while leveling if they ever present themselves.
---
That’s why ret is so ineffective, despite being a really kickass dueling spec (due to the short duel range).
---
The myth that playing alliance warlock is substantially worse than horde is just false
---
Is warlock not viable at all in blues? I've heard mixed responses in being gear dependence for warlock - some say it is, some say its not bad.
---
I'm a fairly competitive player (played LoL, OW, HS and HotS for many years reaching good ranks), but I never played MMORPGs (I only played wotlk on a pserver with a fury warrior up to lvl 80 and not much more).
---
So my question is: I know that engineering is very, very good, but since I'm really noob, is it still that worth? On one hand, I could use some extra dps to compensate for my lack of experience and skills, on the other hand I think it would just be better to go for an easier profession (I've heard engineering is very expensive and it also means having even more keybindings).
---
Tier 0: 'dungeon set' or blue quality set from Strat, Scholo, UBRS, LBRS  
---
Tier .5: upgraded version of dungeon set. blue -&gt; epic but won't be released until at least AQ  
---
Tier 1: 8 piece epic set from Molten Core  
---
Tier 2: 8 piece epic set from BWL and Onyxia  
---
Tier 2.5: 5 piece epic set from AQ. Considered a .5 set because it wasn't a full 8 piece set and the itemization made it a sidegrade for some classes/specs  
---
Tier 3: 8 piece epic Naxx set
---
&gt;you can bring 60% undergeared people that have no clue and still firsttry almost every boss.
---
Not even close to being true. 
---
&gt;2% raiddps will never be the deciding factor (MAYBE on sapphiron week 1) unless you are horrifically messing up.
---
Also not true. You seem to have a very inaccurate memory of vanilla WoW if you think that every guild in Classic is going to be easily clearing every single raid boss in BWL, AQ 40, and Naxx as soon as they release without any sort of close calls. Especially if they're bringing, as you say, undergeared players with "no clue."
---
&gt;With lootcouncil its not up to me me, its not up to fair RNG, its only up to wether the powers that be
---
No... it is up to you. Only you can control your attendance, your effort, and your contributions to the guild. Those are the factors that any decent loot council considers for loot decisions.
---
&gt;I can not work for it in any tangible way
---
You work for it by contributing beneficial effort inside and outside of your scheduled raid times.
---
&gt;In short unless i try bribe or suck to to the lootcouncil theres a big chance i wont get the item during the entirety of classic.
---
This sounds like a great way to not get items either.
---
It's like choosing to be a mercenary over a doorman then complaining when you get shot. You can stream on a PvE server.
---
...and hear that music.
---
Blizzard invented a time machine.
---
My female dwarf rogue learned draconic.  Was funny to watch the aftermath of the wrathgate when alexstraza and korialstraz thought no one could understand them.  
---
No idea HOW she learned it, but it was a thing.
---
I had a great time yesterday with a shaman tank in SM Lib, Arm and Cath. Zero wipes if you dont count me body pulling Renault by accident.
---
If you want to play a "less desired" spec, but feel like all the doors are closed for you (whitch i really dont think it will be). You could run boomie in alt/social raids. Many big guilds will have one and are more welcoming in those.
---
&gt; Any guess what would cuase the 2.5% spread? Thats almost as much as the warlock spread. 
---
I'd guess race fantasy.
---
Sub numbers peaked in BC and Wrath, so they were definitely great expacs.
---
I was playing with my brother who is new to the game, so we were playing heirloom-less. When we got to about level 9, I had a friend who wanted to join us leveling, so he hopped onto a new character with full heirlooms. Without doing a single quest, he leveled his character from 1 to 7 by just running to us and DoTing everything along the way for it to die. It was so defeating...
---
Yes definitely go human.
---
I definitely would love mage because I would always be able to provide food/water for my group, the portals would be amazing but my hangup on that is the gear competition between my warlock buddy and I while leveling and that no matter what when we look for a dungeon we would have to find a tank or healer.
---
If you wanna blow shit up, roll a mage. Druid is okay at everything and excels in nothing.
---
Why would you think I want new content?
---
Agi is always &gt; str while leveling. Crits and avoidance matter, ap gains are negligible
---
Idk why anyone would downvote you. Everyone knows blue team = bad. Simple arithmetic.
---
I love dumb meme specs so here's my take:
---
* Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot. These slots are very important in raids so this build will be frowned upon in a high end PvE guild.
---
* If you want to go dual-wield and deep-ish arms, you're probably going to have a ton of rage. Improved Heroic Strike might be better than Deflection. Maybe something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/353050213020105001) for your Arms tree.
---
* MS is based off weapon damage which means it only really scales well when using a big, fat, slow 2-handed weapon.
---
If you want a solid PvPvE build you should look into fury-prot hybrid.
---
Shadow Priest in classic that loved to duel, you're completely correct. Shadow Priests and Rogues are strong in that context, but struggle greatly in larger group PvP. Both are fine in BC, but in vanilla they were of limited utility.    
---
The most useful thing about a Rogue was what I can "disruptive play." Meaning instead of traveling with the group, you go to their graveyard and sap/distract/etc. Get a few looking for you rather than defending the point/getting the flag/etc.    
---
Shadow Priests could Mana Burn spam healers, but Disc was better at it and brought more group utility.
---
This, a lot of Vanilla felt like World of Roguecraft. One of the safest all-around options and wield an extensive toolkit for PVP utility.
---
MC (zone) was made in 1 week by John Staats and was done on the sly without official approval.
---
Nah bro. People tend to put classic on a pedestal, but it still had a lot of flaws.
---
This, I hate when ppl do this shit. Honestly the post should be removed due to rule violation.
---
Well if you want max herbalism on a bank alt you will need to level him to 35.  Between herbalism and engineering to me herbalism has more opportunities to make consistent gold and support utility for a pve guild.  Engineering is more for min-maxing.  It has tons of potential pvp and pve.  Some guilds might even require it for aggressive raid progression.
---
But you can spend half an hour reading?
---
Lol, it’s never going down without a plague or nuclear war.
---
How on earth would an option to swap out ***client-side*** models cause disconnects?
---
 &gt;1% Dodge is huge, way more important than 5% health.
---
This is highly debatable, especially endgame where we could be talking about 500+hp for a bear.
---
Put on a 5 minute delay if you care about stream sniping.
---
Harassment is a crime.
---
Stream sniping is not.
---
There is no pets bro. Nothing on the box info for CE states a pet.
---
If you think that 1v1s happen often enough in premade BGs to justify taking a rogue over another class than you obviously never played. Its not that bad to take a rogue in AB, you can do that (can, no necessarily want)
---
It had flaws, but nothing from classic crippled the game further down the line. Flying and dungeon finder led to the empty world the game suffers from today.
---
Adding one spriest for shadow weaving is a net dps gain over replacing it for a warlock
---
I mean the only main difference in Versatility between Priest and Pally is the spell selection. Priest gets cool spells to heal with, but Pally will be able to provide Auras/DI for wipe prevention/Buffs/Bubble which is pretty engaging and powerful. You might spam Flash of Light but to say that's all the spec is would be a little disingenuous. 
---
Priest just gets to heal in different ways, but that's it. MC is a fun spell and Fort is a good buff, but it ends there. Paladin might not get all the heals, but tons of ways to interact with others. 
---
Also Mage in 5s is the same as Mage in raids. You just MIGHT get to AoE more, CC more, and make consumes less. End of day you are still spamming frostbolt until P4.
---
And pay the Blizzard Bills
---
Rothschild
---
i never realized this
---
No. It was never on the CE box, nor description.
---
I was initiating conversation, thinking people would understand I may want names for valid reasons and so I didn't elaborate.  Yes, I want to take up as many names as I can, -for valid reasons-.  People assumed the worst, perhaps my fault in not elaborating but oh well, I don't feel too bad about it.
---
And yes, I made that edit once this thread could not be salvaged.  I will see you noobs on the field, with my incredibly rare name[s] (you forgot the s ;] )
---
Agreed, loved Blackrock Foundry. It's higher on my list than Legion and MoP.
---
This may or may not be the cause, but Druids of all specs benefit hugely from paladins and negligibly from shamans.
---
if you're worried about getting a raid spot, then your chances are greater as a rogue than a shadow priest for sure. But, personally, if I was adamant about raiding as shadow, my game plan would be to join a good raiding guild as a holy priest first and over time talk to the raid leader about my desire to be the main raiding shadow priest. If you're consistently showing up to raids, and perform well, then long term i'm sure that could be an option.
---
No, what matters is consistency.
---

---
In Vanilla to make powerful flasks you need to do it in Scholo or BWL.
---
To just make a regular healing potion and such you can do it wherever.
---
Yes, you'll need to visit one of two locations with an Alchemy Lab whenever you want to create Flasks.
---
One can be found in Scholomance (in the room of the Lich boss) and one in BWL (right after Lashlayer).
---
I think they only removed that requirement in WotLK.
---
PVP is for scrubbies.
---
Appreciate a response from someone who actually played the class.
---
This is retarded advice, dont listen to it.
---
you want at least 2 palas and then theres max. 1 healer spot. 1 is not alot, adding a spriest can be a worthy consideration.
---
If you want comfort why did you get a racing style game chair.
---
Just stay in the NE lands.  As a night elf rogue, you might want to get used to daggers, since human rogues and fury warriors will be fiercely competing for the swords and daggers will be free.
---
For leveling you can go with a mix or affliction/demo, or you can do a drain tanking afflic/destro build.  The latter is probably better for pvp realms because you wont rely on VW tanking, meaning you can have a felpup or succ out to help with getting ganked.
---
For pvp I think soul link is pretty strong/survivable, if you are going to only PVP thats probably a solid choice.  A good choice for pvp and raids both is probably SM/Ruin, but in the raids that relies on you getting one of the debuff slots for corruption.
---
I've never played warlock, but this is just what I've come across in my recent research (I'm planning to play warlock).
---
It’s been a long time I don’t even remember where those places are or what’s considered a powerful flask
---
you're keeping names from others if you make more than 1 class and don't immediately start playing it, and don't immediately delete a char once you decided you dont want to play it again.  Why are you keeping those precious names from me for your lvl14 hunter???
---
Not really as of recent games.  For a new game, with a new developer, sure.  But WoW releases (and Blizzard releases for that matter) have been pretty flawless the last several major releases.
---
I use an Ashley Furniture recliner, I put a mouse pad on my arm rest, and a Razer Tartarus keypad on the other. Max support and comfort.
---
Mortal strike is a big NONO in raids
---
Arenas and BGs arent duels
---
No no. I’ll let you keep digging your hole.
---
They changed the game, and sent it down a rocky path, but I enjoyed them just as much.
---
Flying hurt wPvP, but I don't care as much about that. BC also brought better raid mechanics and lovely zones.
---
Dungeon finder would have been lame, if I wasn't busy as shit when Wrath launched. Wrath had the strongest theme and zone design, so good that it made flying make sense. Not to mention one of the best raids ever. Though, the changes to instanced content in Wrath are what inevitably brought end game design to its current state.
---
People legitimately enjoyed all 3, despite their differences. Numerology not withstanding.
---
Swordwind! That sounds so metal I love it
---
Wow, ever single word that came out of your mouth was wrong
---
So Draenei Shaman and Blood Elf Paly confirmed?
---
Fuck off asshole. I don’t have much else, and if I enjoy it, then so what?
---
You are right about Feral but he is looking for something low effort. To make feral work you have to put titanic amounts of gearing and farming effort.

I'd better get my irl name on the reservation.

Honest thoughts are that I just flat out don’t care.  I’ll just default to the ‘how was it in Vanilla’ train of thought and say leave it as it is.

As soon as you get the world buff your character is useless until raid time so you can really only get them the day of the raid

It's crazy how oblivious ppl can be, but that whole social challenge is part of why I love healing.
---
haha cheers ;)
---
Yeh I also realized the 50 char limit and immediately thought: "wow, this dude is gonna multibox like crazy!" lol.
---
It's a weird thing tbh. You aren't doing anything wrong and you might have made it sound way worse then what you are actually planning OR you are actually way worse and will go batshit crazy, with 15 accounts, just to get your super special names. Who knows.
---
Either way, you are free to do what you do, so it comes down to some kind of "moral dilemma" and "should you do it just because you can" stuff. And that's where we humans differ lol.
---
Just FYI, you aren't that disgusting any longer, but I still don't really get why it's so important to have these exact name.
---
With farts.
---
And a small str gain will make you consistently kill mobs with the *same* amount of hits.
---
Whereas crit and dodge will allow you to consistently kill mobs more frequently with one less hit and take less damage.
---
Read this: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#dps
---
You can tank any lvl 60 5-man and atleast offtank raids with just 15 points in prot.
---
Might be good to keep that in mind unless you wanna be THE main tank all dps/solo farm capabilities for a minimal increase in tank efficiency.
---
Less competition for loot
---
They've said there will be transfers down the line.
---
I don't think he cares mate, this OP's a whacko and I like him a lot.
---
I don't think it's debatable. More health just means you can take bigger/slightly more hits. You shouldn't really be tanking adds much as bear druid since we don't have shields, and even there dodge will reduce way more damage. Against a boss dodge will reduce the damage you take, way more than 500 health will. If you needed the health as a breakpoint, then it would be more valuable, but there shouldn't be any big health breakpoints.
---
5% health is good, but 1% dodge is unequivocally the better racial. PvP it's a little fuzzier, since the health can help you live longer and therefore cast more, but even there dodge is very helpful especially if you run gear with 0% dodge.
---
WotF used to immunitize for like 30 seconds or so. Was it already a single use fear/charm break in 1.12? Didn't that come later?

I believe Sanctuary block damage can crit. Going off pservers and not memory from 2006 tho.
---
IKEA Markus beats all chairs in look and comfort from the lowliest gaming chair and all the way to an Eames i've found and thats BEFORE you factor in price.
---
Fair point, and I dont doubt they would destroy the game again... but maybe just maybe they will understand what classic is and why it works. I doubt it, but I have some shred of hope/faith.
---
My job has plenty of shitty aspects too. It's a job, I deal with it.
---
Old ones have quite bad resolution and I would love to see them updated. However, current updates on BfA are terrible and therefore people dont want this change
---
They're both endgame dungeons and flasks are very few, things like grant X strength for 2 hours persist through death ( i dont remember flask stats).
---
Gaming chairs are dumb and overrated. I also dont like the arm rests most of them have. I stick with Spacepro office chairs. Never had any issues, plenty of room and I could sleep in it and wake up fine. I'm 6"2 and I love them.
---
I fucked up somewhere recently because all my ads are for autochess. Sometimes getting multiple in the same video. 
---
So sick of idle mobile games
---
Orcs with an axe, I would imagine would be a notch above since 5weap skill pretty good against bosses.
---
Tranq shot is clutch.
---
Good one!
---
And now comes the anger and pitiful self justification. Just accept that you are wrong. You don’t have to change, as is the nature of the ass. But the anger you’re feeling is from the knowledge that you are wrong, and the cognitive dissonance of not accepting it.
---
If you ACTUALLY read and try to comprehend, instead of just pretending that you are, you'll notice that I started the thread by saying that PvPers started migrating to Alliance during Cata. Some rando is the one who claimed WoTLK. So instead of being an aggressive jerk towards someone and demanding they explain what AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON ENTIRELY claimed, why don't you calm down and stop make the mods twitchy, hmm?
---
Thanks for the response - appreciate it!

Here is one of the best gear list i've seen [Taladril's List of Druid Gear] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml)
---
This guide is about raid tanking but its still a great read to understand bear tanking [Taladril’s Treatise on Druid Tanking in Vanilla](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#plink-tank-and-dps-build)
---
no
---
Pick pocket is affected by level difference, if you have bigger level than enemies you are stealing from you have less chance for resist.
---
You're a bit off the mark here, just FYI. Secret Lab chairs might "look" like DXracer and other shitty "gaming chairs", but they're legit about the best you can get. 
---
The Titan, which I have, is flat out amazing for support and comfort, and they run a bi-annual sale which makes it possible to snag these at around 300-400 USD.
---
Based on your post I have to assume you either have never tried a Secret Lab chair, or you didn't realize it was one, versus the actually-shitty other "gaming" chairs.
---
This item is basically 15mp5 considering you proc almost every 30 sec.
---
Oh OK thanks I think I’m good to go
---
I was about to upvote you, then I read unless you're Alliance. Well, see you on the battlefield sweaty pig.
---
I dont necessarily mean dueling as in within your faction but 1v1s in general, that includes a lot of wpvp.
---
no one knows 
---
yet....
---
Don’t force yourself to level engineering as you initially level up.  Just take mining and save the materials, along with skinning and vendor the leather for extra cash.  Then swap mining for eng once you have your mounts.
---
Many actors stop when they get a taste of being the public eye.  Streaming requires you to perform infront of an audiance.  If a news caster was broadcasting for four hours+ from a static location, they are going to get the random looky loos, the news chasers, and people that want to be on TV come by their set and "harass" them and the crew.  The major difference is people can stay at home and interfere with streamers, but requires more time, effort and money to go interfere with a news caster.  
---
Also, if they seriously can't work a job out side producing something besides consumable video content, and they are so thin skinned they can't take being killed on a PVP server or PVP battle ground, they could take 10 seconds to add a stream delay, so that it is harder to identify where they are.  
---
Or record content before hand and broadcast it while interacting with the live chat.  there are so many other solution, but because they take extra effort most of these lazy ass streamers that can't get off their xdracer gamer chairs won't take the time to do it and cry like a teen girl. /rant
---
It'll be hard to gauge. I've been an avid gamer ever since I was like 7 (I'm over 30 now) and I certainly didn't suck back when classic was a thing. 
---
The thing is there is a real chance that my experiences were before certain adjustments that made Warriors easier to level between then and 1.12. Talent changes and maybe others.
---
So it's quite possible that I remember correctly but won't have to worry about it in the 1.12 reboot.
---
No, they shouldn't quit. They should realize it comes with the territory and deal with it. My job has annoying/shitty parts to it as well. I'm not gonna quit, I'm going to adapt.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it.  No multiboxing =p
---
I put high value in names for my chars, and know I'll try a bunch of classes, so I don't want to have any regrets about missing a better name.
---
Cheers
---
I'm of the same mindset.  If feel like people should be given a chance and taken seriously until they prove otherwise.  If they're fucking up and can't adjust with some criticism, then they're not good for your group.
---
If you're playing a class that's considered a capable healer but want to DPS, cool.  Let people shoot their shot and have fun.   In most cases a group of decent players can see where they're falling short and adjust strategy or fill in the gaps where needed.
---
I welcome the challenge of running dungeons with less than optimal specs.  So long as we're all aware of our shortcomings and adapt.
---
7 eastern
---
I'm going human rogue because I like playing the bad guys :D
---
I never raid because I only like to pvp but I did all the mop raids at least on lfr difficulty or whatever it was called then and they were all badass and pretty fun
---
It's like a different game lol
---
Don't warlocks but out some good shadowbolt crits in naxx?
---
Flasks past 2h, through death and have powerful effects on top of costing a lot of gold to make:
---
* Supreme Power, 150 spell damage/healing
---
* of the Titans, 1200 hp
---
* of Distilled Wisdom, 2000 mana
---
* of Chromatic Resistance, +25 resistance
---
* of Petrification, makes you immune to all damage but also unable to move or do any action for 60s
---
The last 2 flasks are in much lower demand and the last one is an exception as it doesn’t last 2h but instead 60 seconds.
---
Wrongo.
---
Secret Lab chairs have excellent support and comfort. You clearly have not tried one my man. Don't confuse them with DXracer and other shitty gaming type chairs.
---
I knew that - is that really all MC talk they do in the 1:20 hours?
---
The latest you will find out is August 13th. Other than that nobody knows anything else for now.
---
&gt;Why would you need an LFG addon in Classic, when you will run dungeons with guild mates and friends?
---
Are you really asking that? Of fucking course people are going to use a tool that lets them quickly and easily get into dungeon groups.
---
Defined as doing damage for 30 seconds then sitting for for 2 mins to drink
---
Why the fuck do people still see ads?
---
Yeah, eventually
---
they are indeed
---
On private servers I encountered warriors who couldn't or wouldn't tank.
---
The tank shortage will increase acceptance for feral duirds
---
Plenty of losers here too pal. "They would never play Retail because progression raiding actually takes skill and you don't kill bosses just by auto-attacking."
---
Glad you have made other experiences. It‘s just my advice for a happy work/life balance
---
You sure as hell don't try to get people playing for entertainment banned or disciplined for playing the same game and playing within the rules.
---
Why? It did exist in classic.
---
yeah maybe, i just find it hard to believe that a senior citizen is this invested in wow.
---
No not really, but most of the content complied in his podcasts are live streamed via twitch where users/listeners ask questions. Josh then puts it all together in the podcast. If you join his discord, he will send out an alert when will be live streaming calls or fielding questions on specific topics.
---
For pvp full ret build is meh, much better to go Reck build:
---
1. Stand like dork and get crit 4 times
---
2. Hammer of justice into 5 autoattacks
---
Not the 15th Anniversary CE you dolt. The original Vanilla WoW CE had pets, and people who bought it back in the day get to keep their pets in Classic.
---
yeah that can be fine in Wpvp
---
depending of if it was a large battle or not, most are small in the world
---
His point is when we were young wow graphics werent as shit as they are compared to today's graphic standards. But I think the gameplay is more important, there is a large amount of players who play inde games or other low graphic games.
---
All of this. The gender consensus is that the vast majority of people here want as close to a Vanilla experience as possible. And that is what we will be getting with the release of Classic.
---
I can't imagine Blizz creating new post-Naxx content. That would just take additional time and resources away from Retail.
---
With Classic Blizz isn't exactly reinventing the wheel or adding anything new so it's not much of an investment on their part. Creating, testing, and implementing brand new content on the other hand is an investment that might not even pay off.
---
I'm sure a lot of people would agree with me here that if Blizz did decide to add Post-Naxx content I would just cancel my sub and go play on a Vanilla pserver.
---
Personally I would love to see a TBC server added. But we are at least 2 years out from hearing anything so let's just all enjoy Classic then worry about the next step when it's closer and more relevant.
---
If you are taking gear for dps and not doing any meaningful dps with it, its a waste.
---
We’d like to think that but the reality is all leather, mail and plate wearers will be rolling on leather and cloth for dps/healing gear.
---
Depends on the amount of warlocks. To just say it is a net dps gain is a stretch.
---
You don't get it buddy.  You can't reserve more than 50 names, and I am making a longer list as I'm sure many will be taken, and they'll only be on servers I intend to play on [or possibly switch to if needed].
---
buddy.
---
I just need everything. It’s how you play.
---
Streaming _is_ a real job... smh. They provide entertainment and earn an income as a result. However, I fully agree that they need to adapt and not cry. They can adapt by playing PvE servers where sniping can’t ruin them, they can stream on a delay so they can’t be pinpointed, they can record and release videos after the fact, they can run with friends as body guards, there are all kinds of solutions! Them stopping streaming and quitting their job is _not_ a viable solution.
---
Also, not one of them cries for discipline when they have their groupies mass report or jump down some casuals throat. No one gets diciplined when they use their following to kite Kazzak to SW and troll hundreds of players.
---
Just get over it and move on.
---
Ayyyy \m/
---
I can see that, I slide all the way up to my desk and most of the arm rest goes under it and I rest on the desk so the length doesn't affect me. Padding is another thing though.
---
With filters alliance warlock is the lowest 9.4% on the pvp server. Now I definitely want to go alliance gnome warlock, wotf is over rated.
---
If there were good tanking axes, which once you get to raiding, there are not.
---
Have you decided what race &amp; class? That impacts the name a lot probably
---
Servers should be up in 5 hours, until then I can't really try anything else than hit play button and watch that server list. Have you participated in previous stress tests too?
---
Upvote for The Musk!
---
Sounds pretty much the same as my experience playing Vanilla. I loved it.
---
Heres the thing... I'm a try hard. I will play my walorck to the maximum I can. But I'm not a raid leader. If my guild wants to bring a ret or a shadow or whatever, then that's on them. They can bring whatever they want and we can clear everything except AQ40/Naxx anyways. And that's at least a year down the line.
---
Completely agree with you that the game, and all games, should be an even playing field and find your explanation great!
---
Phil of Accounting!
---
Correct. Mini Tyreal i think?
---
&gt; And a small str gain will make you consistently kill mobs with the same amount of hits.
---
Well, that's just simply not true.
---
&gt; Whereas crit and dodge will allow you to consistently kill mobs more frequently with one less hit and take less damage.
---
Yea, if you get a lot of it, if you get a tiny amount of agi like you said with strength, it's a tiny percent of your fights where it will have any impact at all, where as with strength it will cause you to consistently kill mobs in fewer hits, that means you have option to play around it instead of praying to RNG gods.
---
Sure some strength gets wasted on mobs where you don't hit the breakpoint for fewer hits, but crit is also wasted when it's the last hit.
---
On top of that much of what you do as a druid doesn't scale with crit at all.
---
its temporary chill out
---
Did they add more people to the closed beta?
---
BC incorporated flying but Azeroth proper wasn't plagued with it during BC's lifespan. It also introduced Arenas and small-scale competitive PVP, laid the foundation for objective-based World PVP, introduced Paladins and Shamans to their faction counterparts, and had some great and memorable Raids in Black Temple and Kara. Kara especially was an inviting and approachable challenge for smaller Guilds without the drive or desire to pursue larger-scale content.
---
Bring it! /flex

Super Tread. Name him or her: noinformationsinside or raceclassisrandom

You have to spoonfeed these millenials everything ..............
---
Okay so you lied to impress a bunch of people online. Cool.
---
No, the network has absolutely nothing to do with it. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
The biggest bottleneck to WoW's performance to not using multiple cores in new CPUs efficiently at all. With enough game objects and processes on screen, something has to give.
---
Because he is completely wrong about half the things in the post even if he is completely right about the idea.
---
Any hunter does the job just fine honestly. Go dwarf or orc for extra fuck you rogue.
---
Sure it is. There's just nothing to sell you that you actually want or can be hoodwinked into wanting and have it be profitable to run google ads for, so it can only ever fail at selling you stuff.
---
Can you recommend any reading (or just have a short summary) of the difference between going Daggers and Combat? I'm very curious.
---
Moonwalk123123 would be my name
---
Kara was a joy
---
Thank you.
---
well it's more neutral intentions to be fair, I am hoarding for the future.  Oh no someone called me a noob on a gaming subreddit, what a jerkface!
---
There is no way you can actually believe that. Classic was dramatically better? BC was literally classic but with improvements.
---
Class design? Better in BC.....Dungeon/Raid Design? Better in BC..... PvP? Better in BC. 
---
The only actual argument that can be accepted is flying but let's be honest, at the time it was incredible but i do agree that ruined a lot with the game.
---
Leveling crafting profs is actually pretty *easy*, it can just be expensive.  The good thing about your plan is that you can save cloth and blue/green gear to latter craft and disenchant.  Plus you can disenchant tailoring crafted items too.
---
You cannot track two different resources on the minimap in vanilla though, so you would go with skinning and something else (mining or herbalism).
---
My plan is somewhat similar to yours.  Level mining and skinning, at 60 drop skinning for tailoring to craft the lvl 60 bop robe, in addition to bags and whatever misc stuff I can pump out before dropping it.  Then drop it for engineering, and level that with my mining stockpiled materials.  Have a bank alt for disenchanting BOEs from tailoring (at least stuff that does not sell on the AH for more than the mats I would get), because in vanilla disenchanting only requires lvl 1 profession to D/E anything.
---
There are guides out there for lvling professions, so you can look at what you need and just sell the excess.
---

To be fair Swifty's IQ seems to be around where someone has problems boiling a tomato
---
i literally cut to the core of why your statement was stupid, using the same exact logic as you did, and now you just go to straight personal attacks.
---
Any character you create keeps someone else from using that name on that server.  I plan to play a bunch of characters, I will keep a bunch of names from other people by making those characters.  You do the same, just for less characters.
---
Where's the cognitive dissonance?
---
Literally broke up with my girlfriend and got back with my x because she understands how real shits gunna get.
---
Why do I feel like the music is used unironically
---
Sometimes yes, sometimes people just have different preferences. I'd rather play a spec that does 5% less DPS than a spec I don't enjoy.
---
It’s because ally hunters get pally blessings and horde hunters get called tranq shot bitches
---
im sure this is incomplete but as far as i know...
---
warriors/rogues/hunters have thunderfury
---
warriors/paladins/hunters have sulfuras
---
mage/warlock/druid/hunters have staff of atiesh
---
There are trainers in gold shire and a bag vendor in the inn
---
Where in anything I said did I say they _deserve_ to be protected?? Fuck no! They deserve no special treatment whatsoever. I’m just saying it’s an improbable solution to advocate for them to _stop streaming_. It is not at all likely and is equivalent to asking someone to quit their job. As I mentioned in other replies, they have other tools to diminish the impact of sniping and those should be advocated over the equivalent of quitting their job.
---
It seems to strange reading this, back in vanilla most people had at least 1 max level toon and a slew of alts they had at varying levels (if not at max).  
---
I only had the 1 character at max level cause I spent all my time on my lock, I did have an ele shammy in his 50s and a rogue in the 40s, then a smattering of hunter, warrior, etc.  
---
Just makes you wonder what sorta bubble some of us were in to only really see the huge volume of raiders on our server.
---
Am I correct to assume that your rationale with this sword spec was that 2 swords &gt; 1 sword? More Sword Spec procs, more rage through Unbridled Wrath, more resources to dps? More hits would also allows you to capitalize more on your crit chance, since now you have 2 sources of crits (MH + OH) that also both could proc additional swings that also can proc, so more Deep Wounds and Impale value? Equip swords with on hit effects / their own chance to proc an additional swing and drive it home like that? Really cool idea, I like it! Only downside I can see with this is your dependancy on hit chance, even after the 9% soft cap. But I guess that is something that DW Fury warriors are also dealing with (I'm no expert, I just like to theorycraft :D). 
---
I don't know how DW swords with sword spec would hold up against DW with Flurry, I gues that depends on your crit chance (so probably the value in DW swords with sword spec would be at low crit chance gear, but as soon as you get into high crit% gear, your Flurry uptime will definetely outperform the sword spec benefit, if it doesnt already at pre-raid BIS).
---
Because mobile phones rarely have proper ad blockers.
---
Ideally communities would correct the imbalance themselves. More likely people will just intensify the problem by joining the winning side.
---
 On PvP ps horde players somehow convinced themselves that they where the true victims because thier BG wait times where long without asking why they where long. 
---
I predict people will demand access to paid realm transfers when leaving a look sided realm to avoid having to start over from nothing.
---
bloodelves happened
---
Hope you have a warlock to summon the replacement!
---
Hunters are a viable hunter class
---
Came out in 1.12
---
Cross server BGs started in Classic and that led to other cross server features that ruined the community further down the road.
---
balance in *MY* vanilla?
---
its more likely than you think

So real it hurts!

---
I'm joking. In all seriousness, just hit the randomize button to get names that sound cool, and change those slightly.
---
Idk I enjoyed BC and WOTLK just as much as classic personally as a casual raider. Kara and WotLK’s Naxx were some of my fondest memories, however that’s largely due to striking absolute gold in terms of my guild. 
---
Definitely some sketchy implementations started with Wrath tho.
---
Implying I couldn't do the same with my laptop (if I were thus inclined).
---
Any ideas on specifics, like pets, is "track hidden" worth it, is engineering worth it? What would be my best tools for the job?
---
So my "money" is based on subjective judgments made about me by people I didnt elect to be my officers most likely ? Seems pretty fair and in no way abusable or prone to drama!
---
Did you get the medium or large size? I’ve sat in a medium but not large.
---
&gt;and the survivability.
---
How is SL not a factor in survivability?
---
They don't have mobility, but its not like they have no CC or no utility.  Seduce, spammable fear, death coil, they have both an offensive and defensive dispell.
---
A lot of people seem to think they're gonna be pvp badasses on warriors lol.
---
Can't wait to spoil their dreams.
---
They pull high threat numbers and bring zero CC, while also often competing for loot with the tank in 5-mans. Good players will have no problem grouping with people who know them but PUG groups will absolutely be hesitant to invite warriors who won't offer to tank.
---
I wonder how much worse lvling as prot is compared to arms or fury
---
If you use a 2h when you solo, and use either battle stance or berserker stance. No doubt it would be slower, but I was wondering by how much
---
did you buy them used? you can usually find gems on craigslist from office parks that are liquidating assets for around $200-$300. those chairs are over $1k new
---
its kinda what it sounds like to me. I'm interested to see if this "oh don't worry about spec or class! Don't worry about end game! Don't worry about BiS!" lives up when the game actually launches. I suspect it won't, you can't put the genie back in the 2006 bottle.
---
If you're a warlock surely you'd be begging for a shadow priest? I know I am.
---
That sweet 10% holy damage aura so they can be put in the group with the four DPS smite priests.
---
In seriousness though, it's all about overall composition. Yes, a Holy paladin can get the same group buffs and auras as a ret so from that perspective they arent super useful, and whilst it's easier for a Ret to keep up JoL or JoW on a boss, a Holy could do it.
---
The thing is flexibility - if you've got loads of priests and resto druids available and want the paladin buffs but dont need another healer, then why not bring a Ret? 
---
Also, it's worth noting that the most popular raiding Ret Spec is 21 Holy 30 Ret which heals almost as well as a pure Holy Paladin in a raid (just lacks the 5% passive crit). Having someone with this hybrid spec that can bounce between decent healer and kind of acceptable DPS gives you more versatility depending on whether it's a DPS race fight or a mass heal fight.
---
Hi if you're a warlock surely you'd be begging for a shadow priest? i know i am., I'm dad.
---
How are there not more mentions of The Prodigy? Fat of the Land was 7 years old but half that record was fucking ubiquitous in the community during vanilla lol. Also a few other songs like Spitfire from newer stuff.
---
  It is odd behavior to come onto a post where lots of people are contributing their thoughts about healing in a video game and to start antagonizing people for no reason?  You keep referring to one part of the post that doesnt even change the overall theory. No one is even arguing with you about it.  Why are you so hostile about a healing discussion? Really weird please explain
---
The posts are getting more and more autistic in this sub
---
It was better than the new main movies.
---
ok who cares, i hate the whole dynamic of the class and would rather gouge my eyes out than level another warlock again. 
---
Tried it ONCE on a TBC server because they say SL/SL OP. I was still waiting for when the fun began. Seemed to me the whole class was terrible the whole way through
---
You will always have to deal with pvp but honestly it’s all part of the experience, learning how to adapt and avoid is part of leveling imo
---
So you're not a clicker?
---
Does that mean we see it in Phase 6 with Naxx release?
---
If that’s your only example of you acting out then maybe you should reread all your comments. You’re making it very clear that you have summer off from school
---
BC was my favorite time, i just wish there was no flying
---
Sad and true, as a feral I will have to compete against dime a dozen rogues
---
If you're taller, get the large size. Medium is horrendous to sit in
---
WoW has a bad habit of leaving the old world behind each expansion. BC definitely felt the effect of flying. World pvp was limited to Nagrand bombings.
---
An expansion shouldn’t be held high for its self contained quality but instead by what its changes did to the future of the game as a whole.
---
Also lets not forget BC also ruined faction identity with paladins going horde and shaman going alliance.
---
Kneegrow
---
I am well acquainted with that run and it's no biggie.
---
NE Druid is a great idea if you want to avoid unfair pvp.  Since you have stealth, travel form, and track humanoids (which even lets you see stealthed rogues in the minimap), you are hard to kill and hard to corpse camp.
---
And yes, this is especially true on a fresh server without ganking 60s.  I had an easy time on my druid in Vanilla pvp wise.
---
I'm a huge fan of what BC did to class specs, making all of them playable at max level content. 
---
WotLK had the best WoW raid ever created with Uld. Activating Heroic mode by playing the encounter differently was brilliant and I don't know why they didn't stick with that method. 
---
I just really don't like anything post Cata.
---
I did setup a discord server : [https://discord.gg/Yap8a7c](https://discord.gg/Yap8a7c) , for all Parents that want to create a guild.
---
Just the stress test.
---
Yup, fully agreed. There are solutions that don’t include stopping streaming, that was my only point.
---
track hidden will allow you to spot a stealthed rogue few yard further... but realistically if a rogue want to avoid combat, you won't ever find him... that's the point of their whole class.
---
Sorry, I wasn't 15 years old when Vanilla came out so this doesn't apply to me.
---
Im talking about blowing all your silver on 6 slot vender bags when the AH has em for half price.
---
Engineering is strong in any PVP setting. Track hidden doesn't work as well as you'd like, especially with improved stealth talents and what not. Rogues and warriors are my biggest reason for wanting to roll Orc hunter come classic. 25% stun resist is amazing against both of those really strong classes.
---
My understanding was always that you were not meant to get into Soil. It was just a song that achieved meme status along with that horseshit power metal warriors crap because they were in the Pat video.
---
actually most of the shit spec players i've seen are so dedicated to their role that they'd be in much better raidgroups if they were playing a decent class, as you have to compensate for the memey specs by bringing more consumables, knowing the class more and being perfectly geared. I've seen far far more lazy players who turn up with a "gimme" class like a mage or priest and half-ass the instance.
---
As someone who has been in other stress tests, It could be 10 minutes to three hours of trying to log in. Getting kicks constantly.  The second stress test went a lot better then the first but today will be interesting.
---
yeah I thought so
---
The big streamers are making more than you in your "real job". I wish I could do it.
---
The flaws in the dkp system are minor compared to others from where I stand. We had all the new guys spend like 1dkp per item no one else wanted, all other items were bid on. We never had any serious drama. 
---
The other guild I was in with a loot council was a toxic cancerfest because someone always disagreed with the council.
---
That's how you'll play once with each group before getting blacklisted.
---
I kind of pity the people who see WoW as a game primarily about getting loot, because that mercenary attitude of "I'll put up with with these other assholes so I can get my shit" that a lot players had and have guarantees they will meet with frustration and disappointment in the game.
---
It's the same as working a job you hate with people you don't like so you can afford a slightly better car. You will burn out. You will one day realize that you've frittered away your most precious resource -- time -- being unhappy in exchange for empty prizes.
---
People who play WoW for fun, for social experiences, to experience all the content alongside people they enjoy -- they're happier in the end. Better able to weather the inevitable bumps in the road like player attrition and being stuck in progression.
---
Caring about loot in this game is a mental trap. No guild worth playing alongside is going to deny you a raid slot because despite your high attendance rate you somehow failed to win loot. The guy on top of the meters? He's there because he's using a mainhand sword that dropped from a boss you helped kill too. It's all a team effort. People don't get geared -- raid teams get geared.
---
If you really want to enjoy Classic raiding for the long haul, get your mind right before you start.
---
&gt;There is something interesting that will be taking place with the release of Classic that I feel is being ignored or at least not talked about greatly, and that is what will be taking place between the Phases of Classic.
---
Because we are all under the assumption it's going to be vanilla-like.
---
People thin BWL in phase 3 won't be out for 8 months, I doubt this highly but if it happens then it makes sense.
---
HotW Feral-Resto hybrid is fantastic for PvE content since you can heal and tank with the same build.
---
In both world PvP and battlegrounds it also makes you nigh unkillable which is incredibly frustrating for you opponents.
---
It doesn't have the damage output as some other builds but a skilled player can just kite people to death and be really obnoxious. 10/10 would recommend.
---
I’d rather then just squish to realms together if they could. I know server limitations might prevent that though.
---
Retail &gt; Classic
---
Okay that sounds fair I mean it dosen't hurt anyway as long as both options would be a thing but if not it dosen't matter that much in the end
---
No beta
---
Weird! You deal with it _instead_ of quitting?! Wow that sounds eerily similar to what _I_ was advocating: not to stop streaming, but instead dealing with it in other ways.
---
Legit anything.  Scattershot and ice trap.  Orc resists stuns, dwarf can turn off blind and crippling poison.  Why the hate for rogue?
---
The blacklist is a joke. Been there done that.
---
Yes they are. Enjoy playing WSG with 9 randoms from other servers that you will never see again.
---
I'll be rolling human just because, if I'm going to stare at it for a couple to thousand hours, I'd rather stare at a human.
---
You don't want a shadow priest, because ideally you only want 2 warlocks.
---
Ret is significantly more than 5% behind. We are talking multiple times behind.
---
Blind Guardian - Mirror Mirror .
---
(They do)
---
You act as if they play for 20 minutes and log off. They play for hours every day. You have no idea what the late-teens and early-20s generations want or do and your assumption that they won't play WoW Classic is completely baseless.
---
I am prepared!....
---
to stare at the login screen a lot!
---
Not the beta or no, not the stress test, the beta?
---
It will be in when BGs launch. We are only getting crossrealm battlegrounds.
---
Macro flair. Ever played a moba and use smart cast? You can do that with flair so you don’t have to press the button then confirm click the green circle on the ground. You just press your keybind and the flair shoots to your cursor location.
---

---
Annihilator axe
---
Demoralizing shout
---
I’m probably missing some
---
On Live I had a human bank alt with black hair, a monk named Steliokontos.
---
Usually my bank alt is some random character gimped/unfun in the current expansion so I just mail my stuff to them. Since I'v emostly played on RP servers their names tend to be fairly normal for their respective races.
---
You mean a chat addon or auto trading/enchanting when someone opens trade with you? I dont think there is something for the latter
---
The mini Tyreal I got from going to blizzcon 2008 in Paris. I have it on my account but since this was during TBC before Wotlk I guess this will not be in classic.
---
Be a gnome and say you're really a human, but vertically challenged.
---
For dungeons it's not that big of a deal though having CC can be the difference between an easy run and a hard slog. Most meme specs have only situational CC. It's still not that big of a deal though and no reason to deny them for the most part. Raiding past MC is a different story but raiding isnt the only endgame though if you're into PvP getting raid weapons and gear makes a HUGE difference. A T2 or better geared player takes a massive shit on a fresh 60 or someone only decked out in blues
---
I want my White Mechanostrider Mod A with the bugged head fin that was only visible from one side!
---
Most people seem to roll Human, get level 12 and move to Darkshore then.
---
Just so you know.

Westfall has to many collect quests that take to long to complete, like boar livers,
---
Imagine not being able to come up with something good about your game, so you have to trash talk another one to make yours look better.        
---
Sheesh.
---
got 48 hours free from blizz, thanks to the based support
---
Rust in Peace - Megadeth was my vanilla soundtrack
---
0 DPS for the woflshead helm for Feral? I get that it's hard to evaluate against stat values but that seems laughable in the world of modern theorycraft.
---
Well that's a better Horde/Alliance split than my original vanilla days.
---
There are random name generators online. Keep generating names until you find some name structures that you like, and alter them slightly to suit your preferences.
---
Most of them have these and you may prefer the sound of Native American names of Tolkien Dwarven names or whatever.
---
For example, I like [this Lovecraftian name generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/lovecraftian-names.php). On the second generation I get Zuidra, which is already fine on its own or maybe I'd alter it to something like Zhudra or Zudros. On the same list is Ghreldeg, which could be changed up to something like Ghrelda which could work as a female Orc name.
---
Laxcreation
---
Hmmm it couldn't POSSIBLY be because the test doesn't start until 4:00 PM EST, COULD IT?!?!??!?!???!?
---
Name yourself something confusing.  Name yourself after a class, but the wrong class.  Like create a priest, but name it Warlock.  Or a Warrior named Hunter.  Hopefully at least one person at least for a fraction of a second gets confused and you can use it to your advantage.
---
Or my personal favorite iilililiiiililiilil.  Random assortment of i's and l's just to piss off anyone that tries to add you to their ignore list, since in vanilla (and I assume classic) you cannot right click ignore, you need to type it in.
---
What prevents it from working?
---
The point of it is, some warrior attacks are based off weapon damage and if I'm out soloing, I want to make sure the right weapon is equipped for maximum damage.  But if I'm in a group and in Defensive Stance, there's probably a reason I'm not using a 2-Hander, and I don't want to switch before using said ability.
---
Hunter is the best pvp class outside duels, since you cannot kite much in duels
---
You can spec for cat and Still tank all dungeons until 60 just fine
---
Currently have a frost mage on retail and was thinking about doing the same in classic how are they in PvE/PvP for classic?
---
No it, has to be something else entirely &gt;-&gt;  
---
~~Thank you~~
---
Nobody knows how much ganking there will be, but once you hit 60 you will still be on a pvp server and get all the fun benefits that come with it.  So if you are planning to just get to 60 and quit, obviously not worth it.  If only a small % of your time will be leveling and you play for years at 60, then it's worth it.
---
Are you sure you can see stealthed targets with tracking?
---
I used to play a hunter and I couldn't track stealthed targets with just humanoid tracking.
---
No, I have not, unfortunately. I just downloaded it and pressed play. I went into the main menu (broke down from hearing the drums of war), and I got stuck at the realm list with all of them being offline. So I think there's a high chance that this may work. However, it's 19:30 PM here right now and I have work tomorrow, so I'm not sure if I can wait until 24:30, but we'll see.
---
It should be up tomorrow anyway so I can try it out then. I just want to see and compare how the leveling feels in relation to pservers.
---
I was curious about Kala's preference and why. While I love Undead (mained UD priest in Wrath) and they are a great choice, they are definitely not the "absolute" best choice. Troll has some very compelling abilities. While DP is good, Shadowguard is arguably as good if not better. It scales with 100% of spellpower, applies Shadow Weaving, doesn't generate any threat, and procs Blackout. On top of that, it has an incredibly cheap mana cost per damage; it helps Spriests sustain and defense considerably. Also, Hex of Weakness applies a healing received debuff of 20%, does so fully at Rank 1, is the only other class ability that does so aside from Mortal Strike, and is a Curse so can be tricky to remove (esp compared to Devouring Plague which is a disease and easily cleansed). Neither of Troll's racials have a cooldown either. 
---
While Undead is great, don't underestimate roll Spriest ;)
---
I roll on everything that is bis for my class, and will most likely roll on most items that are upgrades, unless it's a bis for another class.
---
You need a poop sock too
---
Armor reduction caps at 75% (just a nitpick, but your math is still in the right direction) so 500hp becomes roughly 2k HP. The issue with this is it's not taking into account that you can get pally buffs on Alliance. 5% health is negligible when compared to Kings, and good luck getting Grace of Air from your shaman on Horde. 
---
If we are talking purely health gain vs dodge and not other benefits, then health is probably slightly more valuable as a tank as it helps with consecutive crushing blows. The 5% health scales a bit better, as it's max health not base, but you'll only be getting ~300 health going into MC and not much more until you get better gear post BWL. 1% Dodge won't scale as well, but would be a bit stronger earlier. 
---
In PvP the dodge is probably not quite as good as you should be kiting and it's useless if they hit you from behind. It's still pretty valuable though as you probably won't have any dodge on your gear and the jump from 0% dodge to 1% is pretty big. 
---
You are right in that it's not quite as clear cut, probably shouldn't have raved about it as much, but early on Dodge is the better candidate for PvE. Then when you look at Paladin vs Shaman is becomes pretty obvious which faction to choose.
---
Orc master race checking in (shaman)
---
Tarren Mill Dust. 😁😎
---
Because it can be a 50% DR against certain mobs
---
Hypocrites? How is it hypocritical to want DPS players to do damage ? I do damage on my warrior, so I am not being a hypocrite. Yes I am biased towards my own tastes. There will be plenty of players with a similar mentality and will not be an issue for me.   
---
Classic was never praised for "Choice in specs". It was praised for having that true RPG feel, and it does. That does not mean that all specs are viable or good for all things. The thought that every spec needs to be good at pvp and pve is what got us the homogenized classes in retail where every class has similar abilities just for the sake of balance.  
---
Any classic dev will admit that all specs are not well balanced for raids.
---
huehuehue. I'm just gonna ignore it and continue Bloodstained.
---
imo casual guilds might have loose guidelines for debuff slots, but I'd be surprised if it's something that is micromanaged outside of hardcore raid guilds.
---
The common ones are:
---
* Curse of Shadow
---
* Curse of Elements
---
* Curse of Recklessness/Weakness
---
* Winter’s Chill/Ignite (depending on raid tier)
---
* Sunder Armor
---
* Nightfall
---
* Faerie Fire
---
* Improved Shadow Bolt
---
* Annihilator
---
* Thunderclap
---
* Demoralizing Shout
---
Depending on raid comp/tier and how many slots are left:
---
* Judgement of Light/Wisdom
---
* Shadow Weaving
---
* Improved Scorch
---
* Gift of Arthas 
---
* Hunter's Mark
---
* Thunderfury debuffs (2 of em, I forget what they do)
---
You want to leave a slot or two open for Taunt/Challenging Shout, otherwise Taunt will knock one of the other debuffs off.
---
Well, I love playing a healing priest for dungeons and endgame but I had levelling one (caster damage). I love levelling a warrior (melee combat), but I don't know if maintanking will be my thing...
---
Re install
---
The only absolutely needed debuff is sunder. Curse of elements/nightfall/ other bonus damage stuff is good, but nothing is absolutely needed other than sunder, as it's how warriors get threat.
---
I 100% agree that Corruption is going to be in heavy use early on, iirc shadow dmg dots use a "phantom" charge from imp shadowbolt. ie still retains the buff from the debuff, but does not use up the charge. If people start bringing Spriests in heavy lock guilds I am sure you'll see a SW:pain as well as it hits the hardest of all shadow dmg dots, again iirc
---
Or get dodged and enable overpower
---
Beautiful, ty. Any tips on how to use track hidden, flares or gnomish detection goggles?
---
&gt;Underappreciated in their time
---
You mean greatly overhyped in their time and only truly revealed to have been total dogshit years later?
---
Ashes of the wake. My dude you have good taste
---
I am a tryhard minmaxer so I can carry terribads.
---
bc was still a better game.
---
So are you using some type of Python PyAutoGUI to automate key strokes on all 40 of these accounts?
---
You are not keeping a few names from people for characters you got bored of or intend to really play, which is part of how the game works. You are systematically attempting to hoard dozens of names for the glory of having those names. That was your original thesis. It doesn’t matter how much you try to justify and whittle down your intent after the fact. You already published your manifesto.
---
Also you clearly care a whole fucking lot.
---
My music immersion while PvPing to get the full Vanilla experience is:
---
Megaman 2 - Dr. Wily Stage 1
---
Castlevania - Bloody Tears
---
Maybe I am too old this game...
---
One of my favorites from that era, the editing and music was top-notch for the time!
---
 "performance of your raidgroup"
---
it was mentioned.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1q1ru/new_stress_test_july_1921_anyone_with_gametime/
---
Nah top right :)
---
Muh ignite
---
Does autoloot work with pickpocketing in the beta?
---
Caring about top DPS until you get into at least AQ40 is laughable tbh. Would be like shit talking someone for not wearing full uniform to play catch in the back yard.
---
Even if it would, I don't see the point.  You should have a macro that switches between 2h and 1h + shield.
---
There were good things added but the negatives were too great. There’s also nothing to suggest the numbers would have stopped climbing even without BC. Things like class balance don’t require an expansion to fix.
---
Playing horde doe. Troll it is. Too much vertical Challenged
---
Not a connection disconnect, but a player experience
---
It's fun as fuck in pvp. That's about it.
---
I will be proudly part of the 6.97% least played class. Cuz nostalgia
---
I got to play my 70 twinks again, not even mad.
---
It was vanilla in space with flying.
---
I thought this was pretty funny, don't mind the salty fucks claiming their simple game is better.
---
Pretty sure it’s 5:00 EST :0
---
Well its a boomkin build so pretty bad automaticly
---
I had to get friends to ride the zeppelins for me.. otherwise by the time the other continent loaded it would be too late and start to reload the one I just left.
---
While I don't agree with telling people to just stop streaming (because yes, it is income for some folks), I strongly disagree with the idea that because they DO stream that they're somehow supposed to be immune to, you know, PvP and other players. If they're engaging in WoW, they should be engaging in WoW. It's not a single-player experience, and it is, unfortunately, the cost of making your business WoW. Find creative ways to deal with it. But don't take it out on others who are trying to enjoy the game (which sometimes involves ganking noobs and corpse camping).
---
I guess you mean “flare”?
---
Ask support for 48 hr game time, they usually give it if you're asking as a returning player.
---
Not sure. That's a good question that I didn't think about. I feel like account management is outside of the classic experience, but it's entirely possible that it would not exist at launch.
---
I'll check on that before I try it.
---
I would argue PVE servers are worse for streamers as you have no player vs player solution when it comes to hosting tournaments or community events. If streamers do play on PVE servers they will also make a blacklist there as you will have annoying people following you around all day.
---
I think it's fine for streamers and any guild to set up blacklists and share them (which did happen back in the day as well). I much prefer player/community solutions over Blizzard getting involved to swing the ban hammer.
---
Another point against a blacklist that is often brought up is that streamers will just ban anyone that kills them, but if that is the case the blacklist will get too big which will make it irrelevant.
---
Try Google.
---
The only problem with a warlock is that you get your face eaten by warriors, rogues, and hunters. Otherwise they're great.
---
You bet. This time around I'm getting immersed as fuck in the story.
---
I can see both sides to this. On the one hand, I wasn't a fan of the graphics in 2004/2005, and while they grew on me over the years I would love to see a remaster or at least use their modern counterparts.
---
On the other hand some people really do prefer the old models. I don't think anybody seriously argues that they have aged, like, super well and stand up to today's graphics, so much as the model updates simply are not the same and not everybody's aesthetic choice. For instance a lot of the WoD player character updates took the faces in very different directions from where I and many other players would have because art and interpretation is subjective like that. A lot of them therefore bear no resemblance to their old counterparts to many of us for this reason.
---
I think a *working* method of toggling new graphics would be great. I also think it's important to keep the old graphics because that's part of the charm and nostalgia for many players regardless of which retro game they're playing.
---
I don't think it would be acceptable to just force new graphics onto players in Classic. A lot of the updated models objectively differ from their original versions and some people simply do not like these interpretations. The modern animations are an especially sore spot because they're exaggerated, there's A LOT more movement going on at all times, and many people feel like it veered from a cartoony but distinctly Warcraft III aesthetic to a Disney/Pixar one.
---
I don't think this is difficult to understand and have to wonder what purpose posts like this serve other than to stir the pot or seek upvotes/e-cred from like-minded people. I think everything has been said and is very, very, very easy to find.
---
Not only is it the fresh server that will help you out, but you are dealing with a private server too.  Private servers happen to have some pretty terrible lowbie ganking in my experience compared to what retail is like.  Retail has things to achieve where as private servers (especially now that classic is coming) are pretty stagnant in their content....get to a point by paying money or whatever then run around ashenvale and murder lowbies.  I dont think you will run into as many problems in classic.
---
Don't try to defend your flawed reasoning further when it has clearly been shown that you are just an ass trying to justify being an asshole.
---
It's not gear stealing, it's unviable only if you want to raid like method raids which IS INSIGNIFICANT but then again I don't expect people without to brain to understand more.
---
nah i play healer too gtfo i dont need ur shit self
---
This doesn't even factor in warrior burnout while leveling.
---
Played a mage in vanilla, raided hardcore and made it to about halfway through Naxx progression wise. I alted a rogue that raiding wise was more or less a suppression room slave, which I later mained going forward until the present. 
---
I know both classes in and out, and I'm having a lot of difficulty deciding between the two. I'd love to tank, but I'm not that fond of the warrior playstyle. I'd play either human or undead respectively on if I go Alli or Horde. PvP is not a huge focus for me but I will be likely rolling on a PvP server. I might follow the streamers to be sure I don't roll a realm that might fizzle out later on, I'm not sure on this one though. 
---
My pros for mage is that I already know the hotspots for grinding and how to AoE farm very well, and the ports/tele/free food present a big leg up when everyone is also starting fresh, and it's easy to make new friends by tossing out buffs or handing out food/drink. Cons for mage is outside of a few points there's not as much solo freedom to be found. 
---
Pros for rogue is potential stealth runs, a lot more freedom in where to farm or level and overall I enjoy the class fantasy coming back and toolkit slightly more than mage, and only needing to respec once after hitting 60 and then I'm more or less set. Cons being how gear dependent they are, which leads into the difficulty of getting into groups over more generally favorable classes. 
---
1 people seem to be missing, and which is a rather new idea of late is Arcanite Dragonling debuff. 
---
But for this to occur you will already have specs in your group that are reliant on that debuff to even work, ie fire rogues/Spimp warlocks, and firemages benefit greatly as well.
---
&gt; BC was literally classic but with improvements.
---
And two new races that didn't really fit in.
---
And the first gear reset.
---
And that PvP-exclusive stat.
---
And reverse level stat scaling.
---
No reason to spec tank specifically, any feral druid will be the best leveling tank pretty much. 
---
Watch Kargoz guide on druid leveling, it's amazing :)
---
This is actually a pretty good point. I'm considering a second account myself. I have cable TV that I dont watch and want to cancel and that shit is so expensive.
---
One per group. You don’t phase me.
---
Yea I edited my comment when I realized I had forgotten armor cap, I was just looking for a nice even number lol.
---
Once you factor in Paladins I'm in total agreement it becomes a no-brainer; I've said as much elsewhere in the thread. I was only nitpicking on the 1% dodge vs 5% hp in a vacuum.
---
I think it's a fair assessment to say that dodge is stronger earlier, and hp scales better. Thanks for the illuminating discussion.
---
5pm est
---
Well you are sitting on a nice mesh thing, so if you get out a knife you can work some magic, my friend! /r/DIY ?
---
Episode 3 is better than Episode 6. There, i said it
---
Thanks. I haven't bothered with add-ons for those other servers and no autoloot really annoys me.
---
I mean, we all be riding around in space on Azeroth...
---
You should check out Skarm Tank on YouTube. He has great videos on druid tanking, gear, and specs.
---
Some of us also prefer the old animations.
---
Sorrolong (or Sorrlong).
---
Sounds like Sorrow, So long, Sorry, Zorro, and whatever else, really.
---
I literally just made it up but tbh it's not all that bad, maybe for a Human Paladin or Warlock.
---
Did anyone make a playlist with these kind of songs and, if yes, where can I find it? :D
---
And gnomes are small so there had to be a lot of them.
---
Man I am going to try to squeeze every hour I can for wow classic but full time work, spending time with my fiance, friends, and family is definitely going to make it hard. Lol
---
Oh well.  I will tell pretty easily who the no lifers are lol
---
Yeah I've got a DXRacer too but so far about 6 months in, I love it. Honestly, I just love sitting in bucket seats in general. Super comfy to me and the lowerback pillow thing it comes with is great as well.
---
Okay go fill your raids with Moonkins and Ret Pallys and Pally Tanks and Smite Priests and Arcane Shot Hunters. We will see how much it "doesn't matter".
---
Pretty much every sublime song is a sample/cover. This is coming from.a huge sublime fan who are up near LBC

---
Blue post pretty clearly says 4:00 PM EST in the very first line.
---
The silhouettes are very similar, it's the textures and animations that make the most difference. Additionally face-types aren't different textures stretched over the same geometry, they're handled largely through animations which at least at first resulted in them looking largely the same as one-another. I believe they have tweaked the facial animations to alleviate at least some of this but I quit before they did so cannot confirm.
---
Yeah people using nostalgia #nochange logic to say Classic was definitively better than BC.  Obviously it's an opinion, but there's tons of major improvements that BC had including much better class balance (sorry I don't think anyone can have a decent argument against this) and a much more reasonable raid size (once again sure maybe some people had 40 friends they played with, but I don't think many people can try to argue 40 is the optimal raid size).
---
Well that's a different thing, pretty sure they came after. I found them to be a breath of fresh air, the old ones were 10 years old then or so.
---
Omg I did the same thing. My dial-up internet couldn't really handle 40-man raids either so I would constantly get disconnected as well. Good lord, why did my guild even bring me along.
---
That would be another button...
---
Does weapon switching activate the GCD in Classic?  I thought it didn't.  If it doesn't, you can just embed weapon switches into your ability macros.  At the very least, if weapon switching is on the GCD, you are just hitting the same button twice (using conditionals) rather than 2 separate buttons.
---
For the horde!!!
---
Boom, do it. I’ve been cable free for about 8 years. No regrets.
---
Torn between night elf and human warrior. Strongly prefer night elf aesthetically but don’t want to spend 2 years feeling at a disadvantage as fury.
---
I'm in the exact same situation.
---
Without reset, it's gonna be very difficult for someone to experience the game after few weeks/months: all it takes is one T2 or T3 item on a tank in a guild to almost steamroll all T1 and raid 20. Not mentioning T2.5/T3 weapons wich will come very fast being way stronger than Rank 14 for pvp. So if you new, you either get PLed to naxx and get a servo arm or get absolutely obliterated.
---
But my post has been massively downvoted so I guess wow players aren't up for this and would rather farm for years a TF or BG in full BIS.
---
I got really into the classic level 30 PvP tournament. I played a warrior in vanilla and I was ways useless solo (Even in t2). Unfortunately I still want to play warrior but I also want to partake in duels. 
---
Is it better to just roll warrior and accept the limitations of the class or would I be better off going rogue, hunter, warlock, mage?
---
The thing about warriors is I love to collect the shiny weapons and gear. I also enjoy the class fantasy.
---
I would consider rogue but they don't seem good in duels without CDs and I would enjoy a class that is somewhat decent all the time (otherwise I may as well go fury warrior)
---
Sounds like there is Lichery's Caterer Addon for food/water, but I didn't see anything for enchanting.
---
They’re not just updated, they’re *different*. The human female faces legit look like they’re from Tangled.
---
It was anti-thematic.  Vader is a commander who is scary because of what he knows and believes.  Rogue One made him into a prequel villain.
---
I was embarrassed to see it because they got it so wrong.
---
&gt;Thunderfury debuffs (2 of em, I forget what they do)
---
One of them slows attack speed on the primary target, the other increases nature damage taken.
---
Viable and optimal are 2 very different things.
---

Maybe I'll remake it for Classic. 🤣
---
Did you ever see Blaze Of Glory? It had a great theme, too (and more 80s music). I can't recall who made it, now.
---
Not that I’m complaining if it’s an hour earlier, but the info I’ve seen showed 2pm PDT, putting it at 5:00EST - maybe I can find a link to show
---
Original models for everything, especially character/race models. There will be *no* option to choose the BFA models.
---
\&gt;but to grind mobs for rep or gold as a healer  
---
Solo or in a group? Solo grinding anything as a healer is not really a thing. That is like buying Mage Water as a Warrior.
---
You are supposed to grind/farm with other players. You get most gold by doing dungeons and professions.
---
I imagine initial instances were balanced on  16 debuff limit. Makes sense to keep it initially
---
Strafe left and Right while moving backwards, hamstring/rend and only get i range when the timer indicates that you will auto attack again ( generally we prefer slow weapons so you may be out of range for upwards of 3+ seconds. Also wear spirit gear early, the dps and crit we get from strength and agility will only slightly increased our kill times while spirit will let you chain pull mobs more frequently before healing with bandages or food.
---
Smells like assmad WoD babies in this thread.
---
Banksy
---
Yeah, another thing to consider is that sitting pre raid BiS you will only hit 67% dmg reduction on armor, so it's another negative against the health. As your armor and total health pool goes up so does the 5% health bonus, so it scales way better than the dodge. That being said you'll be in pre-raid bis until P3 so while the Health will be stronger for longer, the dodge is still a very nice benefit for a while.
---
I'm sorry but that makes no sense. Having an exceptionally well geared tank means more threat, and more mitigations. That means DPS can output damage at a faster and earlier rate, leading to faster boss kills, and healers have an easier time due to more mitigation.
---
Loot in classic has a ***massive*** impact on the performance of your raid group.
---
It's also about preserving your ability to have fun.  If someone starts out top of the meters, they have fun knowing they're kicking ass and useful to the guild.  Then other people get gear and they fall further and further behind, then they're no longer the top.  Then when it comes to 20 mans or maybe they have more raiders trying to get in, you're not the top any more and they feel less inclined to bring you, halting your fun.  Meanwhile, you PvP since you're on reserve and that is a bummer too because you haven't gotten anything from raids to supplement you.  
---
Being on the wrong side of loot council has this happen.  Any DKP system where you're not in the very first raid is like this.  It's a pain in the ass to strike a balance that is fair and not everyone after loot is ONLY after loot.  People want to progress their character.  It doesn't mean they don't care about anything else.  It's a piece of the fun pie and gives them the opportunities they need to keep having fun.
---
can i come with no talents at all? i am the talentless warrior ...
---
Yeah! I remember they have a flip isn't that right?
---
Str &gt; Agi for consistency was the prevailing wisdom for a long time, but it has since been dispelled. Shedo has done mountains of math on this that I won't bother with here, but you can look up his work. The upshot is that agi is a larger 1:1 dps increase than str, especially at lower levels.
---
Well I love trolls, but im talking about beta testing done by Saturnalia on the WoW Classic Warrior discordd (And warrior lead for the Countdown to Classic Horde guild). Hes a mega try hard, so I take his word. But, you can ignore what hes tested if you want.

I haven't looked it up but I recall 5 sec immunity.
---
Some people are really clinging to the "if I watch a streamer using different graphics it ruins the game for me" argument. Or the less common "if I make my character a certain way I want other players to see my character that same way" one. I think both are very weak arguments in terms of whether something should be changed/added. It comes off as literal autism, honestly, and just sticking to "let's keep classic classic and not change anything" is a stronger foundation to argue from than this "my taste is better than yours reeeee" bullshit.

Hm is that actually a thing? I might have to give my bankchar a generic name, like Bob.
---
Go Orc. Nothing more frustrating as a Rogue than a @#$%ing Orc Hunter.
---
I'm not hostile.
---
You made a thread about an argument you clearly don't fully understand, and insted of asking for help you wanted to "challenge the general mainstream".
---
The general mainstream has been theorycrafted, simmed, and tested ad nauseam, and that's why it's generally accepted. You come here, with minimal understanding of how downranking works, and half-assed maths.  
---
And, according to those other comments:  
---
&gt;You made this entire post and didnt bother to learn how healing works?
---
&gt;you just presented random information without actually knowing anything about downranking penalty.
---
&gt;It's not that we didn't know the five second rule, it's that we didn't want the tank to die to a parry hasted crushing blow.
---
I'm not the only one thinking you are pretty much clueless.  
---
Also, most of the really useful information in the whole thread came from Geohfunk, not from you.
---
You want constructive criticism? Here's mine: next time you think about teaching something to people make sure you actually understand what you're talking about. Next time you think about "challenging the general mainstream" make sure you're not just flatearthing.
---
Your main should be human whenever possible due to rep gains. It saves weeks of grinding
---
If there was a way to put money on it i'd bet some cash on the fact that they will introduce the WoW In-Game shop just for these TCG mounts &amp; pets. Because the TCG cards got discontinued it's a nice way for them to grab some easy cash and also move towards the inevitable WoW-Token.
---
Imagine losing a ZG mount to a trial on a roll.
---
I love my dxracer. Best office chair I’ve ever owned. I wish I could buy one for work.
---
Yup. Plus warriors, hunters, shaman and other druids in addition to rogues. 
---
It’s not like Wrath or whichever xpac it was that gave you the stat bonus for wearing gear type made for you class. Plus gear gets itemized better in later expansions. Classic is going to be a free for all, for the min/maxers at least.
---
I think you anf /u/zizzs are a bit confused. Debuff limit was 8 and raised to 16 with the ZG patch. This means shadowpriests are possible from MC in Classic unlike in actual Vanilla where they were not considered with 8 debuff slots. The debuff limit was not removed in Vanilla.
---
Tell that to all the Jedi he hunted down and killed. Vader was a mass murderer.
---
She has to do it in Teldrassil.
---
The entire post is made without accounting for this "small" assumption. It's not small, it's the entire reason why healing strategies are the way they are, and you're trying to say that way is less than optimal without accounting for a key part of healing. Great job proposing a "theory" without knowing anything about the subject though!
---
This is why you make friends in the game. You join a guild and things like gear and min-maxing become fun, instead of a chore. I became obsessed with what was best and it severely limited my fun. Wow is supposed to be fun. I wanted to roll a class and race that I liked, not be forced to roll what was optimal because it was the best.
---
If a person feels like their goal in Wow is to raid, and they want to be the best and most optimal, then do you. Play the game in a way that makes you happy. Just remember that there are toxic and elitist players everywhere. Some people are just assholes. People can be elitist without being toxic. The main thing to remember is to have fun.
---
I’ve seen deep wounds take off more important debuffs.. :3
---
Yes. But they fall behind Mages/Rogues/Warriors quite a bit. They cannot DoT or use bets effectively due to limitations in vanilla (no pet scaling w/gear, limited boss debuff slots).
---
SM Ruin Succubus. Soul Link. Those are probably 2 dominant specs.
---
It created the standard for expansions to really be sequels that replaced the previous content.
---
The style wasn't any less cartoony. The cartooniness was in fact a significant factor in my not wanting to try it at first. It looked like fucking Hello Kitty Island Adventure. I understand the reasons for going cartoonish over realistic, and it did eventually grow on me, but let's not pretend it was gritty and brutal and less cartoony lol
---
But that was deliberate.
---
&gt;asking for what's viable or what's the best raiding spec or what's the BiS gear for their class.
---
There's literally nothing wrong with this. One of the greatest things about vanilla is there even *being* a BiS list you can obtain and know its the best you could actually get. Its something to aim for.
---
Whats not fun is saying "just be yourself lol" then having poor results, no direction, and nobody interested in taking you because nobody told you Ele shamans aren't a spec people bring to raids in any significant number. Thats just a shitty thing to do.
---
I was thinking either a shaman or mage. Can you be named “shaman” or “mage” in Classic if Its available ?
---
You asking how TBC and Wrath are new content... Well, it's not lol
---
I know a couple of guilds that is DKP but lootcouncil on tanks, legendaries and some really big pieces like DFT.
---
I played a holy paladin PvP healer and I think rogues are great in arathi basin.  Y
---
I learned you have to take a little extra care of them during big fights.   and be ready with the blessing of protection if they run out of all of their  tricks and are getting piled on.
---
Keeping dots off rogues is also important.
---
I'm interested in this piece too. It doesn't appear to be something I can do currently on the pserver, but I'll admit that I don't have nearly enough time played to know better than an experienced player. It may be something I haven't ran into it yet.
---
I won't go to any depth, but you might want to doublecheck it.
---
1st 1hand weapon you list is Wraith Blade, but AFAIK oomkins can't use swords.
---
The lube bottles are deodorants.
---
&gt; Class design? Better in BC.....Dungeon/Raid Design? Better in BC..... PvP? Better in BC. 
---
These are all subjective opinions.      
---
          
---
Broadening viability of hybrid classics to be on par with their less/non-hybrid counterparts is a failing in my mind. It was the first step towards the modern homogenization and entitlement we see where classes all have similar tools to achieve similar goals instead of having intentional shortcomings/weaknesses that must be filled in by group dynamics.          
---
              
---
They leaned hard into 'branched, long hallway' philosophy for dungeons in TBC, as they felt having done so with Scarlet Monastery was a big success and worth emulating. We never saw any BRD's or LBRS/UBRS's again, which is another unfortunate turn in my mind.       
---
And the addition of arenas to PVP? They divorce PVP from practically every aspect of the WoW MMO experience by nullifying the relevance of faction, removing the 'massive' part of multiplayer, and canonizing a gear pipeline in a sterile environment around which pvp balance was to be predicated for years to come.          
---
             
---
All these things are *bad* to me, but my opinion isn't fact either. Whether these things are deal-breakers, massive improvements, or non-issues depends on who is doing the assessing.         
---
           
---
So I'm not the guy you're responding to, but I actually do genuinely believe WoW Vanilla was "better" than Burning Crusade and Wrath. But I won't sit here and try and tell you that my word is law on the issue.
---
For TBC, a friend and I went all in on boosting alts with the recruit a friend program.

Make a mage alt for farming if that's one of your big pros, it doesn't have to be your main
---
still not following what you're trying to accomplish, my guy. if you're soloing with a 2H (questing, farming mobs), you very rarely have to switch to 1H mid combat. only time i've ever done so is when i'm getting ganked by a hunter and want my shield on till i close the distance.
---
If you fill your raid full of ret pallies, dps priests, boomkins, etc then your guild won't last very long.
---
The people who are carrying your dead weight will quit for a better guild.
---
You realize people are currently playing vanilla wow.  This is a good example of how your classic wow will be played
---
I never did like the wow names with an apostrophe in them. That said, I always assumed they'd bring back names for realms like you said.
---
I feel like any post mentioning legendaries requires a default disclaimer that 99.95% of players in vanilla never even got close to having one, and, further, so many factors outside of the individual player's choice influences who exactly does get one, that you would be silly to base your class on them.  Just play what you find most fun and engaging.
---
Dafuq... How there is shamans on alliance side and paladins on horde side O\_O
---
None of the traditional systems are perfect, but combing a couple of them with loot council oversight so they cant be abused is a great option.
---
Sellsumats
---
&gt; What prevents it from working?
---
it will equip your 2-hander every time you press it.
---
&gt; The point of it is, some warrior attacks are based off weapon damage
---
And heroic strike is not one of these abilities.
---
I mean...unless the rogue has frost reflector. Then you lose because youll never get the distance.
---
I’d agree with that. I played a ton but I wasn’t in a hardcore guild. I never got into bwl, though I pugged AQ20 and ZG and did MC in a guild and with pugs. It was still fun as a no lifer casual raider. Always stuff to do.
---
DKP is the only way to do a drama free loot system.
---
All these people talking about how you can hoarde dkp for a BIS piece obviously have never used it.
---
DKP has decay rates, specifically to combat people who don't use their dkp to actually better their character.
---
Each week or 2 weeks you go without picking up a single piece decays your total dkp by 10%-15%.
---
The only time loot council was ever used in pre bc was with legendaries.
---
AV was boring this time around for a number of reasons. Very poorly itemized gear is one of them. Another big thing I personally disliked was all the mages going imp blizzard spec and spamming it just to be cocks. In my opinion that won't be a thing at 60. We also won't have every single AV have 15-20 mages all doing that, and/or running in and arcane exploding. AV is already one of the lesser enjoyed BGs, and having everyone in there messing around without any intentions of winning the game only makes it worse.
---
That is a druid trinket.
---
Solo's biggest issue was the guy playing Han didn't look enough like Harrison Ford. He played the character very well, but Han is such a visually iconic character that Harrison Ford couldn't be replaced. 
---
Also the Darth Maul fan service was jarring for non-fans.
---
this guy is so oldschool he still uses google!
---
"Your worst class is usually rogue" &lt;- Found the guy who never spec'd Soul Link.  
---
Baiting Rogues into attacking me used to be a favorite pastime of my vanilla Warlock.
---
Hilarious, we're going to be right back here again in 15 years and I'll enjoy every minute of it
---
I really don’t get this, it’s not that bad when you consider that the undead classes wotf makes a big difference against you would probably lose anyway without tidal charm and maybe some bombs. I’m pretty sure tidal charm is basically considered to be required to hava a shot at beating mages or priests. Also if you go sl wotf is basically a non issue since you can sac while stunned, death coil can’t be willed so you can summon a 2nd void walker with the demo cd and make a 2nd healthstone (which btw heals more in this build too) and now you have 2nd sac and healthstone available, and sl back up. Sac also prevents knockback while casting so you can bait out wotf from melee during one for free too.
---
If you’re not ahead in the fight at this point you wouldn’t have won if they weren’t forsaken anyway tbh.
---
Basically imo you shouldn’t lose to a warrior or rogue even if they’re undead
---
Mage and priest probably will beat you even if they’re not undead
---
Warlock mirror undead has a big advantage
---
So imo not a big deal, people get too influenced by what they read on Reddit
---
Well it changes how able you are to get gear, which will change how much dmg  you do. At the end of a 2 + year journey and you have full bis, them yes it won't matter, but until that loot trading will change how much dmg you deal indirectly
---
I cant ignore something I didn't know existed. Links?
---
Is prot pally really as useless as a tank as everyone seems to say?  I think, if I'm understanding this right, pallys will all become holy in raids because prot is apparently not as good at anything as a warrior and ret is auto attack dependent.
---
The general idea is that it's easier for people to swallow if it's for specific items, and often it will be known beforehand, than to just trust constantly that a piece will drop and you have a fair shot at it.  Nothing will remove the inherent trust that Loot Council requires to function in any capacity at all.
---
But you will get to keep key binds and your UI setup.
---
BRF is one of the best raids in the entire game.  What was really dumb with WoD was getting more gear from your garrison missions than you would actually raiding.
---
I've already got a guild lined up that plans to play at the time that my kids are just going to bed. 
---
It's going to be awesome.
---
Give me info!!!!!!! Now!!!
---
ah ok. i guess when it went up to 16, we really stopped caring about the debuff limit unless the warlock curse or  w/e got knocked off.
---
Btw you can get the boat to Wetlands, swim south until you hit Dun Morogh, drown and res in the town outside Ironforge
---
Your dps only really falls off in AQ  and onward. And I have seen hunters compete. They are never meter topping, but they can compete if they are good.
---
Oh boy, this ends badly I promise you.
---
&gt;Just over four hours to go before I can finally play Classic again, can't wait!

MORE HOT POCKETS!!!!
---
You know a game is good when it can literally destroy your life
---
I feel the same way actually.
---
You're gonna see some goofy specs, some Crit Chickens, Arms Warriors, and all manner of silliness within the first tier of raiding. What a lot of people don't understand is the Tier sets really define how your character progresses, if you're lucky enough and dedicated enough to put one together.
---
There's very little value to, say, an Arms Warrior, in getting a full set of Might (outside of the raw stats). Druids will make more usage of a reduced Tranquility Cooldown than Hurricane CDR. The meme specs will die out and the hardcore "progression" scene will fill their ranks with people playing their characters "right". If you want to be a part of that scene, you gotta play your role, and that's okay too.
---
Maybe someone will prove me wrong, but if the World First Kel'Thuzad kill has 20 Moonkins in the raid I will eat my WotLK Collector's Edition Box.
---
The solution to people wanting to play meme specs and raid is very simple.
---
Lower the maximum Respec cost down from 50g to about 5-10g.
---
This allows you to raid properly, collect gear, and then enjoy your non raid viable spec
---
1. No, weapon swapping in Classic shouldn't trigger a GCD.
---
2. It does however reset your swing timer.
---
3. There are no conditionals in macros anymore.
---
Is this the one open to everyone with a sub?
---
We always had decided in our guild's class chat who would get the next drop. We never had drama with DKP, but all the guilds I was in  were filled with mainly 30+ year olds.
---
Troll post.
---
hot pockets and redbullz obviously lol
---
This. I personally would love to play with new graphics but I think it's important to preserve the old graphics first. New graphics should only be included if they are completely optional and don't confer *realistic* advantages or disadvantages due to differences in contrast, color, animation, etc.
---
Feral tanks are great off-tanks. Feral dps is okay especially if you dedicate yourself to it.
---
Moonkin is a meme though. You have to go tryhard to be able to do average dps.
---
Bankymcbankface
---
As a hunter I don't get this.
---
if this meme is implying hunters weren't pulling their weight, i'm gonna have to disagree. they were among the top DPS. provided they knew how to weave in aimed shot into the autos. easiest DPS class in raids by far.
---
Just macro your shield+1H to defensive stance. Done.
---
This is why you get to choose who you play with. This is why you can make friends and get to know people. This is why you only run with people who are fair and balanced. And if somebody turns out to be unfair then you cut them out of your gaming experience. And if you aren't willing to put in the time to get to know people and crafts your experience of the community, if you just stay solo person and only group up in pugs and do not engage socially at all, you are asking to end up in politics problems.
---
Blizzard hasn't said anything so searching / asking here won't help.
---
Wait for August.
---
uBlock origin my friend.
---
You literally quoted me saying "usually." And you still took me out of context somehow lol. That "usually" exactly refers to SL lock. But I wouldn't personally bother trying to counter a single braindead spec anyway. Seriously, no one has ever had fun fighting Soul Link and at least rogues  have the opportunity to avoid such a mind numbing fight.
---
Naw man, anything other than the original SW trilogy sucks. Check out Mr. Plinkett's reviews and swallow the red pill.
---
For sure, but I would say an argument that stream sniping is a form of harassment could be made, especially depending on the extent. Being camped for multiple days or 10+ hours is definitely next level harassment that I don't think _any_ player in this game should have to suffer through, streamer or not. Its a tough line to define though. I'd say what I described above would fall into Blizzard's own definition:
---
&gt;Disruption / Harassment: Engage in any conduct intended to disrupt or diminish the game experience for other players, or disrupt operation of Blizzard’s Platform in any way, including:
---
&gt; - Harassment, “griefing,” abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies.
---
To clarify, I'm _not_ advocating special treatment for streamers. I'm advocating that they should (within reason) expect to able to play the game similar to others. I do think they need to be prepared to adjust their play/stream style to accomodate it as needed: play on a 5 minute delay, roll around with a squad, or just embrace it and win when you can.
---
But then what happens to the gear? Its gets sharded? Because although that pally healer really is looking for better then his set gear, so he refuses to spend DKP on it? Seems like an equally bad habbit
---
I was looking in the In Development section!
---
you get an addon that will display your swing timer as a bar, as it's filling up stay out of range and maintain hamstring/rend on mob, as it gets close to the end get in range to auto, then back out until the timer once again nearly fills. The main goal is taking as little damage as possible to quicken you're leveling experience by reducing downtime/recovery. The less you get hit, the more you kill without disruption.
---
Between hunter and warlock I would pick warlock due to the fact they scale much better when geared
---
I though they sacced their pets
---
&gt; You mean greatly overhyped in their time and only truly revealed to have been total dogshit years later
---
I feel like this is actually happening backwards. They were hated in their time, but only now are people flocking to the prequels and saying how great they were in light of the Disney-era flicks.
---
How red is the next Star Wars poster going to be?  Have gone from purple to brown to red.
---
Oh wow. A rage comic.
---
No worries, i am doing my part!
---
Caffiene early on.  Switching to water 4 hours before I plan to sleep.  
---
For food, I highly recommend an air fryer.  It greatly expands the amount of stuff you can cook in a short time without uaing a microwave.
---
Hey that's me!
---
More that i had overestimated how many there were
---
Tbh in 5mans druid balance dps is fine. They don't raid dps because they go oom so quick.
---
It's not really that big a disadvantage unless you're literally going for extreme min/max...the last thing you want is to hit like 47 and think "fuck, I wish I was a night elf"
---
Play the race you will enjoy more, nelf flips all day bro.
---
They just dont have a taunt and will go oom on boss fights. They are still fairly good in dungeons though.
---
Genius
---
They may not scale well later on, towards AQ/Naxx, but they still pull their weight np.
---
Yeah I thought a lot of people played hunter. Maybe it's just a common alt to have
---
Aaaaaaannnnddd... It's gone.
---
You are entitled to your opinion, but your opinion is wrong.
---
He's not your guy pal
---
Why would you put so many zeros behind your one?  Seems wasteful.  :)
---
&gt; they could take 10 seconds to add a stream delay, so that it is harder to identify where they are.
---
&gt; Or record content before hand and broadcast it while interacting with the live chat. there are so many other solutions, but because those alternatives take extra effort most of these lazy ass streamers that can't get off their xdracer gamer chairs won't take the time to do it and whinge like a teen girl. /rant
---
These are the solutions I also advocate for, but we have to all realize that stopping streaming just isn't viable for most.
---
I didn't know shamans were such a popular choice for classic. I wonder if the population would be skewed toward the alliance if paladins were more popular.
---
Also now considering rolling a mage instead of a warlock on Horde. Original reasoning for picking warlock was that mages would be an overpopulated class.
---
As a forever Horde player, I never understood the fascination with IF. Stormwind was always mind blowing to me and I would visit it frequently on my rogue. It felt so vibrant and alive. If y’all want to hang out in a dark, moist, lava ridden cesspool... do yo thang. Just don’t think for a second that those thick walls and high ceilings will keep you safe from my stealthy boi.
---
Key word “were”, now that most rogues, mages and warriors know how to gear for damage hunters have fallen from the top and will never get back there.
---
We used loot council in vanilla, and it worked fairly okay. There were a couple times that loot went to people that said they would use it and never really did.  Had one mage and his lock brother attempt to subvert the system for what they felt was the misappropriation of loot. The lock was an officer the mage was not, and both weren’t all that good plus the mage was just an asshole. For Burning Crusade we switched to SK, and that worked pretty well. We had a couple instances of people paying others to not “suicide” for an item.  Even had one individual running the loot for a few nights while I was out of town, taking bribes to alter positions.  It was mostly for one particular mage, she was known as a flirt and sent pics to the loot master for better positions. He never got to run loot again after I looked at the logs, and he was also anchored at the bottom of the list for several months. Should’ve just kicked him but that wasn’t my call, he left for other guilds but his transgressions were communicated to said guilds. Decent shaman, horrible leader, and effing desperate for some trim. We talked about dkp, but never implemented it.
---
A lot of raids will have a healing priest spec for shadow weaving since the shadow priest dps is so low
---
Will this make me not go oom in 1 min?
---
He's not you friend, buddy!
---
That is a straight up roll, no such thing as a council for items that do not benefit someone in particular or the guild in general.
---
As a hunter player me no do math
---
The main point is it makes grouping more desirable while leveling.  There will be so many people to level with I say why not.  There will be so many warriors that need help leveling that can hold a monster’s attention while you backstab, so why not?

 I just shout for a warrior companion when I get to the barrens or equivalent and

I'm hoping that the PvE realm I pick has few min maxers as they attract less hardcore players
---
The distended universe doesn't count
---
I don't like the new tauren. I prefer the old models, but do agree they were not good to begin with lol
---
I'm thinking it will be different this time around.  Last time there were just 1 server, now there is multiple.
---
Oomkin can't, two pumps and they're done
---
Excuse my ignorance (never played vanilla) but are blues the further-est a casual will realistically go in terms of gear?
---
Don't get hung up on the actual ability... 
---
I thought macros go line by line until the 1st "True" and then end.  So if my warrior was in this situation...
---
**Situation:**  Playing solo, performed a shield slam to interrupt a caster, then went back to perform a Cleave...
---
 \#show Cleave  
---
\#showtooltip  
---
/cast \[group:party, stance:2\] Cleave (**Fail** because I'm not in a group)  
---
/cast \[equipped:two-hand\] Cleave (**Fail** because I don't have a 2-Hander equipped)  
---
/equip &lt;Two\_hand Weapon Name&gt; (Equips 2-Hander)  
---
/cast Cleave (**True**, casts Cleave)  
---
/startattack 
---
Why wouldn't this work... I don't care about why would I do it.  It's more for my learning than anything.
---
it’s not 5% in classic. more around 40% less dps vs equally geared, buffed and skilled primary classes. the only competitive off-spec is the feral bears, especially for early clears in MC through BWL - after that they start to fall behind prot warriors and fury off-tanks.

---
That is certainly one way to get an item in a video game
---
Transfaction vs cisfaction
---
Did you just assume my faction, bro?
---
How is the argument for Dungeon Finder or Raid finder any different? Faster queue times so you can get matched with players not on your server. That is not what Classic was about.
---
Oh go cry in a corner...people like you are just no fun.
---
To the majority: 
---
No, you are not a “pro” gamer. Method or the classic equivalent will not recruit you.
---
Have fun, classic is more rpg than the current arcade. love your class lore; you will not have an army of brainless alts with BIS.
---
Raids are farmed throughout the entire expansion; it’s not linear progression as much as live. Your trying to gear an entire revolving door of 40 people. And what’s BIS will be replaced by crappy resist gear or you will be required to have a lower tier gear that puts a status effect on the boss you farmed from a dungeon.
---
Your min/max will only be viable in a true hardcore progression guild that will be farming world buffs and require all the consumables; lots of prep work and raiding long hours multiple days of the week.
---
If your are asking what is best; you are already being in regards to “private server” guilds that will most likely get world first.
---
TLDR: To the majority— Your not a pro gamer! Enjoy the game; classic isn’t going anywhere you will not be world first; even if they do BC; it will be a different server you copy your character to.
---
100% need a subscription unfortunately mate. Blizzard have stated this themselves unless they fuck up.
---
Very strong, although the dps rotation for pve is 90% frostbolt spam. Some people can do that (it never bothered me) but others find it very boring.
---
Lol. 1 server for 10kish players as opposed to "multiple" for hundreds of thousands. 
---
Good luck bud.
---
improved scorch repkaces winterchill. Ignite is an addituonal debuff
---
Your point about venom is still a very bad analogy even when understanding your intention.
---
Also the needs of your body are only fixed on a minimum level. The caloric intake of a person is more important as soon as the basics are covered. Though in general stuff like eating 3 times a day is healthy. Not because it is the holy number for meals but because people have it easier to be eat healthy when they follow a schedule. They also get fewer random cravings if they have a fixed pattern.
---
&gt; including much better class balance (sorry I don't think anyone can have a decent argument against this)
---
there was a lot of whine back then, but mostly from puredps classes.
---
I think the class balance thing was perfect and completed with WotLK dual specialization.
---
Some people choose to make alts, some people grind the AH and professions, not everyone is trying to play max level raid content.
---
If that’s where hunters are then where are we putting moonkins/ret pallies?
---
Plus lock is generally an easy matchup until they become SL raid tanks, and you won't win spriest anyway!
---
Damn, it looks like your goal on this sub is just to spread misinformation. Every single reply I see from you is just bullshit, I'm actually quite impressed.
---
You can beat out frost spec mages and the ones who don't get the ignites ;)
---
I am very interested in this too. With elitist jerks gone, it's hard to get into vanilla theorycrafting and learn this stuff.
---
I understand your resentment now, please find a guild that suits your ideals and don't go around fucking up other people's experiences.
---
oh shit... you can't use conditionals anymore?
---
That video is SICK too.
---
You will need an active subscription in order to access the stress test servers, according to blue posts. Per Kaivax, “You do not have to have BFA to participate in this stress test. It’s available to everyone in the region with an active WoW subscription.”

That being said, I don’t have an explanation for why it allows login to the classic client even if you’re not subscribed.
---
Same! It makes me jealous since the BC shadowguard looks so good.
---
Hey OP can I play my fire mage in your MC run?
---
I cant understand the big hate against DKP. The system worked.
---
Ty
---
I think Beth played pretty well too! Keep in mind I also don’t have a trinket or engineering :(
---
Just think about the fact it's going to take 200 hours for you to hit 60.
---
They are riding shotgun.
---
I did not need this nostalgia trip. My first raid guild's forum is still online....
---
Nope
---
That's such a gross generalization. Do you think actors and professional athletes do it only for the attention? They have a passion for it and they are doing something they love. You just seem bitter and envious about it.
---
With their feet on the brakes 😂😂
---
Probably never?
---
They were saying they have invited enough people and they are going to invite new ones very irregular and very small batches.
---
Don’t be a puss just do it
---
I'm sorry for your loss :(
---
Sounds like a trash raiding environment.
---
I bet you guys didn't progress very far
---
It is! I love the music that I used, and the last song is my own music.
---
99% of the time I watch cable its me and my girlfriend watching Fixer Upper while we eat dinner. And that's it lol.
---
When you get mad because you hear a trigger word and don't understand what it means or the context around it
---
I agree. I plan to use for my guild. People cite dkp hoarders but they obviously don't know about DKP decay
---
It's not the same though. If you need 3.8 hits to kill a mob, adding strength isn't going to make you strong enough to kill in 3 hits as opposed to 4. 
---
But even 1 agi will increase your chance to crit so that you're actually getting fights that end in 3 hits. 
---
On top of that the extra dodge will reduce damage taken, and given that the OP specifies FERAL TANK, the damage reduction is much more important than a negligible increase in threat generation.
---
Yikes I disagree but to each his own... I like the OP build better respectively compared to yours.
---
I see you're interested about catseye googles + track hidden combo but noone is giving you an answer. The answer is yes, it's worth it. Unless the rogue sneaks up from behind they will never get the opener on you with those 2 active, you can see them from 8 yards away
---
Graphics won't play much of a role here, they will but slow gameplay will have more of an effect, see minecraft.
---
I'd bet most of the younger people won't like it, there will be a niche market for classic after the initial hype. It's a game made for a very specific player.
---
I could be totally wrong though, and people are searching for this kind of long invested journey but I think most of  the gamers now are instant dopamine junkies.
---
Don't get me wrong; I still chuckled.
---
Considering that a cat druid can output pretty competitive dps with sufficient effort, and the fact that I don't intend to join a tryhard guild, I'm sure I can manage at least up to t2 raids.  
---
I don't mind healing, but I enjoy some variety.
---
mulgore! i'd always take my non tauren alts there to level. so peaceful. winterspring for getting those last few levels to 60. honourable mention goes to Feralas.
---
It did and it sucked but Battlegrounds being in a battlegroup is far less damaging than flying over the world and teleporting to dungeons.
---
How old are you exactly and since when do you play WoW? when did you start?
---
Feral bear tanks rise!!
---
They're forced to sacrifice the pet, yes. No other choice when it is a major part of the class and won't scale or survive.
---
TBC is the best for me and many people, as someone else said it's just vanilla improved. The only big mistake they made was flying mounts, but I don't think that's nearly enough to make it worse than vanilla.
---
I don't think anyone's arguing that BFA is better than MoP, or any expansion for that matter. It's pretty unanimously the worst version of Wow from what I can tell. The MoP vs Legion is where it gets controversial.. personally I think they both had some cool ideas, but were both too modernized and way worse than vanilla/tbc.
---
Thank you man. Any tips to kill warriors?
---
Yes many times
---
&gt;Broadening viability of hybrid classics to be on par with their less/non-hybrid counterparts is a failing in my mind.
---
They weren't "on par". They were merely viable.
---
You still wanted a Warrior to MT most encounters. Paladins and Druids just COULD TANK if they really wanted without being stunted by an absolute lack of items.  
---
Anybody could DPS, but Locks/Mages/Rogues were still head and shoulders ahead of hybrids.
---
that still makes it an actual screenshot?
---
I quit my job back in 2006, awaiting the return of Vanilla.
---
Depends on your life circumstances. I'm quitting work 1 week before launch since by that time I would have made enough to repay my debts and have saved up enough to carry me through the next year.
---
Classic will be my top priority for the remainder of the year, so it must be done. You just have to act upon your highest excitement in life :)
---
Because it makes people click the video
---
Go night elf and get all axe drops basically for free while everyone else kills each other for the swords lol.
---
when awarded item - queue mic, belch loudly and say "fuk yeah I got it!"
---
This only extends as far as keeping a good 1h and shield.
---
Warriors are good leveling tanks - and that is mostly due to having defensive stance, very little to do with good gear.
---
This is surprising because warriors need good gear to do normal leveling outside of dungeons.
---
I invested 20 days off from work, so 4 weeks straight.
---
I'm single, no kids and a very good amount of food delivery restaurants around my house.
---
Im looking forward for this no lifer holidays
---
Grenades
---
Rocket boots 
---
Rocket helm
---
Mind control cap
---
Sapper charge
---
Yeah started playing in 2005 and got to 60 just before BC.
---
20-man dungeons were introduced with BC right? I remember doing the "haunted castle" one (don't remember what it was called)
---
Don't sub just for a beta invite. I'm guessing the beta will only last a few more weeks and they havent been inviting many more people unless you know someone at blizzard.
---
You never played male troll?
---
One of the best examples of a boss with unique tactics which isnt that gear dependant is vicidius in AQ you have to use frost based attacks to break him up into little blobs and then as many people as possible put sapper charges in the middle to aoe him which requires alot of your raid to have engineering aswell.
---
It was surprisingly one of the funnest bosses to do once your raid figures it all out and doesnt rely on gear as much as skill, ingenuity and tactics.
---
Would be very interesting to see more fights like this which dont rely on an "ILVL" gear check.
---
I did it and my gf supports it.. lol
---
I’d play human unless you just really hate their appearance. According to a blue post recently, the +5 weapon skill is gonna be pretty huge for melee dps.
---
That being said, if you’re gonna get more enjoyment out of playing a night elf, go night elf! It’s a game, it’s about having fun. My main is going to be a human priest despite dwarf priests being “optimal.”
---
Can't stormstrike or throw up dots since there is a debuff limit.
---
If you think there is even a small chance that we will have wow tokens in classic, I think you've missed the boat. It's a different economy, and it's a game that will reach its inevitable content ceiling.
---
People that watch someone like Summit who is more of a variety streamer compared to like Asmongold which is expected to play WoW, is already getting spammed to stop playing classic because it's shit. I think the game just won't cater to the vast majority but that's fine in my opinion.
---
Grenades for stuns
---
Goblin sapper charges for wiping groups
---
Gnomish death ray for burst
---
Net-o-matic for rooting
---
Rocket boots/helm for gap closing
---
Absorption trinkets for fighting against different casters
---
Some headwear increases stealth detection or allows underwater breathing for escaping ganks
---
It keeps me up at night
---
Unholy Confessions tho
---
How does it feel to have no responsibilities or obligations
---
Yea, but then you move on to the next group of mobs where you need 3.01 hits to kill it and the extra strength pushes it down and you're consistently killing it in 3 hits instead.
---
Fun fact, it is...
---
.. job?
---
Well Rogues can receive TF if MT/Offtank has it already.
---
allows for skimming
---
\&gt;PvE Tanking: Troll &gt; Undead &gt; Orc &gt; Tauren
---
Axe specialization on Orc is BiS unless the Troll has Thunderfury
---
&gt;  will never do all those roles together again. 
---
this is very very true.
---
What's Google? I guess I'll Bing it.
---
Posts like this make me cringe so hard.
---
It paved the way to more cross server stuff and that's where any sense of community was lost.
---
I gotchu for 1k hmu for my Venmo
---
Yeah, for sure! 
---
However, I'm not a streamer just a normal dude who wants to play, but if I was getting camped and killed for hours and hours (which I get is a little unrealistic as you can try and recruit guildies/randoms to come help, or leave to another zone) but for the sake of argument lets say it happened from the same person for several hours and I couldn't go out and level or escape them, I'd be pissed. I do think I have a generally reasonable expectation to be able to _play_ the game. There is a reason that Blizzard has a harassment/griefing section to their EULA. I would hope that a GM would be able to help me if it passed a certain point to where they could briefly time the person out to give me breathing room. I just don't think its as black/white of a situation as people make it out to be, and there is some grey area... I do think that stream snipers overstep into that harassment realm often, but not always.
---
Did you screenshot a comment in that other thread? You could have just linked it.
---
Yea gatekeeping, let's make the classic community even more cancerous than it already is. How about we invite younger generations to play the game instead of yelling at them at the doors, no one like's that grumpy grandpa that's one foot in his grave.
---
We need an AMA
---
FEUER FREI!
---
No pally trainers in elf area I think and no elf pet quest outside elf area.
---
Lmao I like this guy
---
Wait, I'm pretty sure this macro still works... (stance being the conditional)
---
\#show Overpower
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast \[stance:1\] Overpower; Battle Stance
---
/startattack
---
flying was TBC's one big mistake. But it did so many other things better than vanilla that I think it still wins out.
---
Everyone can like what they like. But BC was just a worse classic for me. Flying, paladin and shaman going to both sides and outland becoming the new hub, completely making azeroth pointless were all just terrible for the game.
---
Lock to 20
---
Then onto my main a shaman, enh then switch to enh/resto at max level and hopefully sell myself as a nightfall bitch so I can still farm shit in the open world with the same spec.
---
Agreed, required honestly
---
Pushing from the front.
---
Prot pally is basically limited to tanking 5 mans.
---
And then the half ass player rages when ever anyone tries to give him constructive criticism. Or when he's 2 handed furry, and he rolls on a 2 handers with the holy paladin for off spec, then proceeds to rage, bitch, and moan because the pally got it.
---
Is there a way to get both Goblin and Gnomish Engineering?
---
There are certain things you should be familiar with before other things really make sense. You need an outline to be able to color inside the lines. I'd start by absorbing all the variable information you can. You could reverse engineer the information available  to teach yourself what you want to know.
---
Variables we know:
---
Stat weighting - What do the stats do for each class? What stats offer the biggest net gains for each class?
---
Available items  - What available items are best itemized for each class?
---
Raid Mechanics - What encounters will rely on specialized itemization? Resistances/unique item effects?
---
Getting busy at work but these are some things that jumped to my head you could consider
---
AV weekend was a dumpster fire.  It was really only good for messing around with different specs.
---
Leveled 3 to 60 in vanilla and never thought anything was weird about the experience, to be honest. Found rogue to be more difficult and inviting more people to kill me, even though my expectation was that I'd be able to get away with it.
---
Checks out except for wod. What a dumpster fire.
---
Nah it’ll take me 150 max.  I’m leveling a priest and Leveled 1-60 5 times.
---
Does that mean we should roll a lvl1, die and ghostwalk there. Or would you go later or differently?
---
I would but my lazy 2 year old won't get a job...
---
&gt; Find creative ways to deal with it. But don't cry foul and unleash the internet army on other players who are trying to enjoy the game (which sometimes involves ganking noobs and corpse camping).
---
Fully agreed on this! That was the root of my initial argument, there are other solutions.
---
I also don't think they should be immune by any means, they're the ones joining a PVP server!
---
You don’t even need dkp, just do a /roll for all main specs.
---
My mage friend talks about how he likes fire's play so much more but frost's survive-ability makes it the winner.
---
Could also consider hunter. They are great farmers, you guys would have 2 pets in the group, no gear comp, good cc/utility.
---
Still run into the issue of looking for a tank/healer when dungeon crawling though.
---
Itt: non homeowners
---
STV, the rush of adrenoline you'd get when you hear someone dismount in the distance and know that some PvP is about to go down. Plus I just really like the tropical vibe, living in a cold climate :P
---
Granola bars, diet soda, water, coffee, raw carrots, cashews, PB&amp;J
---
What? Why are you making stuff up? They've never said anything about half of phase 1, they only confirmed it would be disabled at latest when phase 2 is released. And Layering was always explicitly announced to be continent-wide. That was like the whole point.
---
You're thinking about sharding.
---
In July there will be a stress test for everyone.
---
Reflectors.
---
Classic PvE is mechanically trivial. The only "tryhard", "hardcore" aspect is farming consumables and staying consistant in attending because epics are harder to get because of 40 man and smaller loot tables.
---
Hunters always steal rogue gear.
---
Stun resist is pro
---
Did I just get into the Beta, or is this for some stress test that I will lose access to after today?
---
Wow... this thread proves how much I hate hardcore Star Wars “fans.”
---
If the Cata revamp has made the vanilla zones go 1-80, streamlined professions, and new leveling dungeons, I believe it would have been an amazing expansion. People could have forgiven w/e lack of end game content there was because the entire leveling experience would have been overhauled. Instead it only overhauled 1-60, which we just breezed through, then went back to Outland/Northrend for 60-80.
---
Their biggest mistake was not going all the way with the revamp.
---
That's not at all a controversial class and spec to play lol.  
---
Feral Druids are much more suited for offtanking than Warriors.  They have higher TPS, which enables adds to get burst down quicker.  They have higher DPS than a warrior specced prot so when offtanking is over they can move back to the boss and actually contribute.  They can also heal, battle rez, and innervate.
---
I thought wolfshead was BiS for feral for the powershifting. That and farming crowdpummelers.
---
Who else is excited for the pvp montages with bodies by drowning pool?
---
It's not retarded advice, but discretion is certainly advised. I'd never try to WoW buddy my subordinates or supervisors, but coworkers who I dont report to or other departments are completely fair game.
---
They've said that bgs will always be cross-realm.
---
God yeah, this is honestly ideal. Personally I wouldn't mind having loot competition. You can always invite rogues/feral druids/hunters/enh-shaman to dps for you guys so that you don't have to further share the loot. ;)
---
I totally agree.
---
Once the technology was there they started using it for dungeons. Battlegroups are the root for cross server lfg. You pin it on WotLK but it started in Vanilla.
---
Also, phasing wasn't a bad thing. It was temporary, tied to quests, and allowed them to change the world organically.
---
Waste of money - thousands of beta players, millions of subs - you aren't special, be friends with a blizzard employee.
---
You act as if these ever left my music library.
---
At 15 the best will probably be a priest just bubble and wand
---
Its second big mistake was the shamans for alliance and paladins for horde
---
Its 3rd big mistake was making outland the focus and forgetting azeroth existed
---
Great. Maybe they'll leave. Maybe they won't. Either way plenty of people will enjoy the game perfectly fine regardless of Hype levels. Watching =/= Feeling.
---
Wrong thread
---
Everything comes with its drawbacks. I've been working 6 months on and off in different jobs. I'm gaining work experience from different places while also saving up some money  to then live off of and do stuff with. I am also in such a point in my life where the next big step needs to happen but I just need to wait a while longer.
---
So why not use the free time I got and indulge in another life in Azeroth, to re-live my childhood, essentially.
---
Sometimes an edge case like that will exist. But it will be far outshadowed by the crits you'd theoretically have by picking agi over str.
---
You'd level faster you might even be beyond that area by then, and already gotten more gear upgrades.
---
You said "what matters is consistency". Well, agi power/def gains are consistent, str power gains are irrelevant 99% of the time before level cap
---
Lol you had me in the beginning...
---
I’m just so happy that Horde/Alliance is so balanced.
---
That’s a testament to a great game.
---
My personal ranking is:
---
Legion
---
MoP
---
WotlK
---
BC
---
Classic (played until around level 30 in classic, else would probably higher)
---
BFA
---
WoD
---
Cata

I had a friend who did shit like this because the thought it was funny to hustle idiot virgins. A couple ladies in the guild got really pissed at her and were like, "You only get gear because you send guys pictures of tits."
---
She replied, "Yeah, but nobody said they were MY tits."
---
I don’t know if you know Shattered Hand history and what became of WarEnsemble and the server, if not, this may interest you: After Drama/DnT left, the fight was on for server dominance. And as it happened, we did, and ended up being the only guild to clear Naxxramas. But all didn’t end well:
---
In retrospect, she literally destroyed the guild I had been in for almost 2 years. The funny thing is, though, is that I hadn't even realized what she was doing until it was far, far too late. Sure, she'd cause petty drama once in awhile, but never anything serious. Once in awhile there'd be an epeen contest over who could get more of her attention (notice the hyperlink)*, and she loved it, but they dissipated quickly. For the most part, she was just your average, everyday e-whore. She'd enter conversations with a "Tee Hee ^_^" or make a random "EEEEP!" sound on vent just to get attention. She was overly obsessed with how her character looked, and was constantly the center of most of the "lol i saw u in IF and we danced ^_^" discussions. I'm sure many of you have seen her kind before. 
---
She came to us from another guild that had recently disbanded (she had a hand in that one, too). There were posts on the forums accusing her of it, trying to warn us, but they were ignored. All I knew was that we had just picked up a well geared druid and a few of her pals (luna leg humpers*, they'll be referred to as from now on). Seeing as how we had just recently started Naxx and lost a few people, this was a great thing. No one questioned it. But they were, all of them, deceived. She calmly, gradually, deliberately started working into various members; slowly amassing her army of zealots. They were once men - great kings of men. Then, Elluna the deceiver gave to them the nude pics of power. Blinded by their testosterone, they took them without question. One by one they fell into darkness, slowly becoming slaves of her will. She took particular interest in one distinctly desperate fellow. Given he was an officer at the time, he presented a crucial opportunity for her. They'd stay up till 5:00 a.m. levelling alts, constantly be in the same vent channel, stand next to eachother in all the boss kill screenshots, etc. 
---
See, we used a 'silent bidding' type DKP system. Items would drop, an officer would call out for bids, and you'd send a tell to that officer with your bid. I had never realized that almost every time an item dropped that she wanted, one officer would always be the first to ask for bids; instantly, even, as if to beat the other officers to it. This was easy to manipulate because all the said officer had to do was lie about the bid Elluna made, putting it slightly above the person who actually made the highest bid. I recall a time where an item dropped that Elluna had been wanting, and her boy toy was dead so he couldn't ask for bids. I ended up being the highest bidder, and before I could loot it, I had gotten tells from at least 4 of the luna leg humpers trying to guilt trip me into not picking it up. That didn't work, however. It only succeeded in piquing my suspicion that there was some shady shit going on. As an aside: It payed off for her. She ended up with the only 9/9 tier 3 in the server's history, and a plethora of other amazing items. 
---
Not too long after that (after our first Kel'Thuzad kill, and her indirectly causing a few people to gquit), someone who had been wronged by Elluna (don't know the details of that ordeal) decided to show a few of his closer friends the pictures that Elluna had been furtively spreading around. I was one of those friends. I saw them, and instantly everything clicked. Why she'd make pouty faces and mope every time something didn't go her way, why you couldn't get a decent ZG/AQ20 group unless she was in it, why raid performance was directly affected by HER mood. Suddenly, everything had become clear to me. She had that guild by the balls.

But there were some, who resisted. A last alliance of men, elves, dwarves, and gnomes was formed. They marched against the armies of Elluna and on the forums of Shattered Hand, they fought. Her pictures were posted, her diabolical ways exposed, her officer boy toy gremoved. Victory was near. But the power of Elluna, could not so easily be undone. This attack may have scarred her, but it did not stop her. Sadly, she took the guild down with her. All of the luna leg humpers were so deeply offended by this affair that they left the guild in disgust. A few of these people were linked to other people, and them to others still. When the first few left, many followed. WarEnsemble disbanded about three weeks before BC was released. 
---
In the next chapter of this tale, the core of the guild had split into two halves. The half that weren't idiots, and the half that were. Elluna had taken her loyal followers and formed a new guild called "Revelation" in which, surprisingly, she was the leader. They never really did much; so there she remained, locked away. We tried to forget about them, and focused on building our new guild in preparation for BC. Things remained pretty uneventful after that, even after the release of BC. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. For five and a half months, Elluna passed out of all knowledge and memory. Until, when chance came, she ensnared another bearer. Her current guild, Havok. Here she runs rampant, unchecked to this very day with many of the same people who left with her for Revelation. 
---
I server transferred not long after hitting 70, and then quit before Havok was even formed. I was blissfully unaware of it all, until one day I was called back. 
---
Satsloader: "It should have ended when WarEnsemble did, but evil was allowed to endure. There is no strength left on Shattered Hand. They are scattered, divided, leaderless.” 
---
Bogus: “There is one who could unite them." 
---
Satsloader: “He turned from that path long ago. He has chosen exile.” 
---
Tockaray? That was what they used to call me... Tockaray the Gray. I am Tockaray the White. And I come back to you now -- at the turn of the tide.
---
Judgement does not show on there. IMO, JoW is quite nice to have. I think it's a medium tier?
---
You can simply not watch any of that content.
---
As an alternative you could try this if your original idea doesn't work

I don't know if it is any better but Dual Wield Swords... 1% chance to get extra attack combined with the swing speed buff from Flurry should help offset the %1 compared to 5%  
---
Improved heroic strike and charge so you can start spamming Heroic Strike and continue to have more uptime for the duration of the fight...
---
As a mmo the idea of changing the world for one player and not everyone is very dumb.
---
Cmon dude
---
I'm not surprised at all. Have you seen any wow streamer? Their UIs are so garbage you can only see about 40% of the screen or less
---
Every hunter is salty, why’re hunters so salty?
---
Melee Hunter it is
---
You assume a lot about how I intend to play.  The game works in that you create characters when you want and you play them when you want, or not at all.  You assumed that I'll never delete a character I found I didn't have use for.  I didn't say either way in my 'manifesto' (lel I'm not starting a political party), but you assumed a lot to justify your nerdrage.
---
I really don't care lol, this is just fun to argue with people who seem so emotionally invested in shaming people for doing something that is allowed in an online game.
---
It could be worse man, it could be ME
---
Triple DPS would be difficult to find groups with, I think, so it'd be cool if you could main something that could tank. Feral druid could be a good choice!
---
There is nothing they can do to salvage the mess that is BFA. Maybe I'll check it out once the next expansion comes out, but I'm probably just going to stick to the classic cycle for years to come.
---
Unfortunately I've kinda ruled out hunter. I'm not a huge fan of how the class plays. I'm thinking from what I've seen here and what I've got it narrowed down to I'm between a mage and a paladin.
---
I have no idea what that is but I use isboxer which doesn’t automate anything it just broadcasts you’re keypresses to every window and makes useful macros for you.
---
Same for me. This Video made me even go to a children of bodom concert (Well the fact they were playing before Slipknot wasn't that bad of a choice Influence either)
---
This isn’t really about hardcore fans. OPs opinion on Star Wars is pretty damn universal. In fact he went *way* lighter on the new ones than much of what I’ve seen.
---
I love seeing Asmon on the front of these, I come here to the comments to see people’s jealous tears.
---
If most will watch it, it damages the hype
---
TBC introduced three of the worst aspects of the game's history - daily quests, flying mounts and arena. The latter even considered by devs one of the worst mistakes they've created.
---
Reputation gated content and raids that were 90% trash fights, 10% actual bosses.
---
I enjoyed it back then and recently on a private server but I would never declare it the best iteration of WoW.
---
I'm not actually sure. I would assume you can, but people will probably claim it super fast if it's possible. What about just calling it "Moonwalk"? Or perhaps a username from other games you've played in the past. 
---
There are also name generators online, google "night elf name generator" for example.
---
druids as horde. NS+heal for o shit moments. big heals for your team. can go bear form if rogues jump on you to try to stay alive. cheetah to gtfo.
---
Good. Then the streamers and their legions of slobbering fuckboy fans will be gone by the time release hits.
---
Damn, so it would be best to stick to dungeons huh?
---
I actually had plans to transcribe this podcast, hope to keep y'all updated.
---
&gt; Well, agi power/def gains are consistent, str power gains are irrelevant 99% of the time before level cap
---
Have you seen how much agi you need to get a single percentage point of crit/dodge?
---
EDT is not the same as EST.  Stress test is at 2pm PDT, 4pm EST, 5pm EDT. 21:00 UTC....
---
basically it's in 3 hours and 45 minutes from now.
---
Hi Alenya,
---
Thanks for opening this thread, it's been a great read so far. Has bear DPS been confirmed as broken by Blizz? Any other anecdotes you can offer on this front? Thanks!
---
Please let the meme keep spreading. There's already too many locks as-is thanks to all the hype, anything that keeps the population lower the better.
---
Nope, I know it's fun to get caught up in things but the viewership of wow on your favorite streaming service doesn't represent the playerbase for a game or franchise that is 15 years old.
---
They could literally show every raid done by streamers every week leading up to classic and it would not matter. 
---
More people will play than those who give fuck about what streamers are doing.
---
😁
---
Warriors are probably the worse dueling class. No way around it. They lose to most classes 1v1, unless you vastly outgear and outskill the opponent.
---
Yeah there’s lots of anecdotes from casuals saying that they do that, and according to some big poll on wowhead a while ago it’s a pretty common practice. I guess people just don’t like the idea of someone getting rich or something
---
We can only hope.
---
I haven't been watching much streaming, probably a total of 30 minutes. Still got my hype! This stress test will be my first time playing (besides back in the day anyway) and I am just going to make a different class/race than I intend to play when it launches.
---
TBC was the time of Celldweller, Blue Stahli, Muse and Pendulum
---
Is the stress test not available for EU players?
---
Druid or Warlock? 
---
Basically I’ll try to keep this as short as possible, I want to play a class that can get into groups relatively easily and doesn’t have too much gear competition AND is very self sufficient in terms of farming gold or being able to solo quests or not be ganked super easily. Also I don’t really want to play hunter or warrior (hunter has been on/off main since TBC when I started playing and warrior just doesn’t appeal to me personally for reasons I can’t explain tbh) performance on the meters doesn’t matter a whole lot to me, and value/performance in 5 mans and pvp is more important to me than raids (I will raid but not that much)
---
I wanted to know from anyone who played back then or played private servers, will it be hard work getting into groups as a Druid? I feel as though they have a bit of a stigma about them as the worst class in the game. 
---
Also just how annoying are soul shards? This on top of the fact that a friend of mine that I will be playing with also wants to play Warlock are the only reasons I’m leaning slightly more towards Druid atm
---
Also is there anything about either class that I may not know or will find useful? Is there a class that ticks my boxes tray I should consider too? What should I play guys? Thanks
---
Wrong.
---
Playerbase is not = to viewership of streamers.
---
I think it’s going to be a lot better.  The community is much more knowledgeable about the expectations.
---
Considered it. I could probably survive a year or two on savings. But I'll probably just be boring and keep my savings and try to progress my career.
---
Agreed.  It's really up to the player to ensure they're being extremely competitive in the raid.  
---
You can't expect 30 others to get screwed by the bottom 10 for picking meme specs and contributing the same amount as 5 people.  
---
If your guild can't progress then they're going to start looking at reasons why.  If you're doing extremely low DPS you're going to get dropped regardless of whatever class and spec you are.
---
If someone chooses to play a meme spec and it doesn't negatively impact the rest of the raid then fine.  However, most meme specs need a lot of consumables or other time consuming requirements (manual crowd pummelers anyone?) and you're just straight up ignoring them then there's no reason to include that person in the raid anymore.
---
My guess is blue
---
Or, now hear me out on this, we could not watch streamers and avoid spoiling it altogether. It's a win win situation. We get to experience it ourselves and we get rid of streamers in the process
---
I guess I can’t wrap my head around actually quitting my job for a game. Why stop saving up? There’s no way you can live a year with only 6 months worked. Be careful and take care of yourself.
---
&gt;Attendance is tracked, with attendance being taken at "defined" portions of the raid.  During learning new content, that's often time-based (Attendance at start, and every \~1 hour thereafter).  During farming content we know we can do, it's milestone based (Attendance at start, after X boss is downed, then after Y boss, then at completion).  Attendance must be tracked multiple times per-raid to reward people staying the full duration.
---
If farming counts significantly more than wiping on new content, then people just won't show up to wipe.
---
And it introduced sharding to the game!
---
I did that, nothing happened and then added a gamecard on the US account, too but still nothing.
---
Thanks though, given that you got the option maybe Im meant to, too. Ive opened a ticket now.
---
We had world pvp in MoP thanks to timeless isle not allowing flight.
---
which is something I wanted. I want to tank 5 mans (maybe UBRS too?) and heal raids. I was thinking of rolling pally but everyone just says don't. Even if my ideal is just 5-10man tanking and raid healing. Others suggested rolling druid instead because Bear tanks have high hp/armor and a taunt as well as can heal in raids.
---
Mine says beta and I don’t have beta
---
Just for fun I fired up calc.exe - at 10mins/day even assuming you are a pro speed leveler and hit records of like 6 days /played it will take you 2 years, 4.5 months. As a regular player more like 4+ years :)
---
No one reads links
---
I'd be amazed that somebody would sit around for several hours farming one person. It would more realistically escalate to an actual battle where several higher levels come out and everyone's jumping on each other. However stuff like this what occasionally happen in vanilla on PVP servers and usually we would just go level in ault or professions or simply log out for a little bit no one's going to sit around for hours waiting for you to come back.
---
however streamers have made tons of followers and plenty of enemies so they are going to get attacked more often than not but if they don't roll on a PVP server then they have no worries. The choice is theirs.
---
I got to a point where I could just melee rogues to death with my hunter even if they got the jump on me.   I'd just stand my ground and slap than strait to the grave yard.
---

---
You could *accidentally* break your leg August 26th
---
I think paladin / shaman going to both sides was good, if you were ever in a predicament like I am for classic (I really want to roll shaman but ALL my friends are rolling alliance. big RIP) it might make more sense. But I get wanting each side to have their own thing too. 
---
I think the #1 most impactful thing that makes people like me prefer TBC is the specs are just all so much better than in classic. Being able to play only 1/3 of the specs in the game at a competitive level, and then a lot of those being 1 button specs, is such an enormous thing if you're a PvE player.
---
Exactly. I enjoy holy and ret. On progress nights I go holy. Then on the off nights we go back to Ony, or MC or what ever and just bring what ever and have fun. I think one night we even had a pally tank. It's a lot of fun, get some great off spec gear, and that's a big deal for paladins. Makes it so much easier to farm world stuff when you have decent ret/prot stuff.
---
Even with decay hoarding is the correct option....
---
But hey, you do you, I just hope you enjoy disenchanting a lot of shit that could've helped your guild.
---
As someone who on live has made the choice of race purely because of performance instead of how they look/feel I recommend going with night elf, I promise you you will be happier playing a race that you really like the look of and animations etc, that small DPS increase will not provide the same excitement to play the game
---
It's swept under the rug because it doesn't matter anymore.
---
Much like modern warfare 2 won't affect 2019 modern warfare. 
---
Legion was fun because there was no other option... release legion at the same time classic is an option (official only, fuck private servers) and it wouldn't be as highly regarded.
---
Only got praise because of what was surrounding it.
---
Trinkets:
---
* Arcanite Dragonling - summons a pet for 1 minute that does about 35 DPS at level 60 and has a ~300 damage fire breath that adds a 30 second +fire damage debuff to the target. The pet's level is Skill/5, so Gnomes will have a level 63 version.
---
* Mithril Dragonling / Mechanical Dragonling / Gnomish Battle Chicken - similar to the above
---
* Shadow/Fire/Frost Reflector - gives +20/18/15 passive resist and reflects all spells of that type back to the caster
---
* Death Ray - Steals up to 1.5k life from you and does about 4k damage to the target, can crit.
---
* Shrink Ray - Either removes 250 AP or gives 250 AP to either you, your hostile target, your party, or all enemies. Usually works in your favor.
---
Net Projector - Snares the target in a 10 second net. Sometimes only roots you, sometimes forces you to travel with the net and roots you both.
---
Bombs:
---
* Arcane Bomb - Steals ~900 mana, half that comes back as damage, 5 second silence, 5 yd radius
---
* Dark Iron Bomb - ~450 damage, 5 second stun, 5 yd radius
---
* Goblin Sapper Charge - ~600 damage to everyone around you, also damages you.
---
* Various other bombs with less damage but similar stuns/radius.
---
Grenades:
---
* Thorium - ~400 damage, 3 second no-damage-allowed stun, 3 yd radius
---
* Various other grenades with less damage but similar stuns/radius.
---
Gear:
---
* Rocket Boots - Basically a 60% sprint for a random amount of time (up to 20) with a random chance to do damage (goblin) or fear you (gnomish).
---
* Rocket Helmet - Charges an enemy, incapacitating them for 30 seconds. Also stuns you for a few seconds.
---
* Mind Control Cap - 20 second mind control, can fail.
---
Legion was a pretty good expansion all things considered but it's not really comparable because it's so different. We can call it the best of the "new WoW". 
---
But even then it's like apples an oranges. This was after cataclysm, and the peak of wow being more of a dungeon/loot  grinder &amp; mount collector game. 
---
Pre cata(but really even pre wrath) was more about the full experience. A proper rpg in a big world full of tough challenges with no handholding. An entirely different philosophy and basically and entire different game. Current wow(and legion) is more comparable to Diablo at this point than the early years of WoW
---
To each their own
---
Good rogues are fine in group pvp.  Most rogues are just not that good so they get a bad rep as a class.
---
Also finding groups is way more about social skills and community than it is about class.  Be less worried about your class, and more worried about making friends and you will be fine.  Its a big reason why Classic is going to be a thing.
---
you leave my hemo fire spell power cloth rogue alone!
---
USA - EST - Alliance PvP
---
I'm looking for people who have responsibilities outside of wow such as being a full time student and/or have a full time job (such as I). My plans are to play casually, taking my time to level and progress by playing a few hours a night between the hours of 7 PM and midnight with more play time on the weekend. If any of you fit this criteria be sure to message me on here or add me on bnet @ Ownology#1296!
---
I don't understand the big hate against horse carriages, the system worked.
---
I didn't like it. While it was better than Mists and Warlords, I hated the ancient artifact mechanic and continuation of the chore-ish follower missions.
---
In regards to chore missions and follow stuff, I liked Warlords version better because you could pick and choose how your base setup. There was also a sense of progression by leveling up the buildings/base. Didn't care for the send X on a 12 hour quest part though.....or the selfie camera.
---

---
Double check your beta classic opt-in settings in your account.
---
I got the ability to install it AS SOON as I created a US starter account. It may not actually work, but still, we can only hope. Just don't tell Blizzard about this (yet), though, please :D!
---
Fuck that. Display that gamer bod that you worked so hard to cultivate
---
Depends greatly on comp I would say, not a standard choice unless your dps is having mana issues, and even then I think it is about a 40-50% chances to gain 60 mana on hit and that may add up but if again no one has mana problems, then it is useless.
---
&gt; Then when it comes to 20 mans or maybe they have more raiders trying to get in, you're not the top any more and they feel less inclined to bring you, halting your fun.
---
Not saying that this never happens, but getting excluded from 20man runs because despite being a core raider you happened not to win much loot yet is not something I'd spend much time worrying about. For casual or semi-hardcore, someone is much more likely not make the 20man A-Team or whatever because the raid leads don't like their attitude (i.e. they whine about loot a lot). For hardcore, the undergeared person is actually more likely to make the 20man A-Team for gear catch-up (the upgrades will have more impact for them).
---
Fretting over loot -- especially publicly -- can do nothing but hurt your chances of getting loot in the future. Squeaky wheels don't get greased, they get replaced. Worrying about it tends to lead to whining about it, so why go down that road?
---
Legion was truly fun because you could really customize your game play and add depth. Playing with 2 legendaries with set bonuses felt like using 2 different 8p set bonuses and trying to break your class. I really love that system. The game had no social aspect though,so it was a slave to content.
---
What is your end goal? PvE, PvP? Mix of both? Do you want to heal or dps?
---
Cats and mop definitely under appreciated for their time, wod wasn’t though. Legion was well received at first because it wasn’t wod but then everyone grew to hate it because of world quests, pvp stat templates, and rng legendaries required to play your class properly. And then bfa is well... yknow its bfa.
---
Overall I give this meme an A for effort though
---
16% warriors, 5man groups are 20% warrior, so even though they're overpopulated you're already short on tanks to start, and that's before the whole "I'm just dps" kicks in.
---
Any spec will murder rogues if played right but intimidation + scattershot will make killing 95% of rogues trivial.
---
Alchemy/herb are my favorite professions though you could always buy the potions. Swiftness potions are always handy and invisibility potions can be amazing since you can drink them from FD. Have no idea how effective the stealth detection potions are though.
---
I am pretty suprised on how low on the scale pally is.
---
Not sure about UBRS but yeah prot pally just isn't good in classic. You'll have a little more success with bear druid overall if you want to stick to UBRS+5 mans with the ability to heal raids. Plus druids have the added bonus of being super annoying in wpvp and wsg.
---
Classic isn't vanilla and classic isn't private servers dude!!!!  /thread
---
I really hate people that keep spouting this trash.  If your guild can't progress they aren't going to carry people that have meme specs if they can't carry their weight.  They're going to look at the reason they can't progress and if that reason is DPS, they're going to try to improve their bottom line.  
---
If you're in a casual guild and you want to try hard a feral DPS by powershifting and farming MCP and you're near the top of the meters then more power to you.  Just don't expect to be in a progression guild and hold people back by going into a meme spec and ignoring consumables.
---
Yeah, sure. Let me know what great tanking axes there are.
---
I'm starting to lose interest that the game that has already existed won't be out for quite awhile. Borderlands 3 will be out soon after. Would've been nice to have classic at the beginning of summer to hook line and sink me and many others.
---
You seem to be a bit paranoid, and your logic of “they aren’t on stress test therefore there won’t be one” is flawed.
---
I got my void walker at 10. Almost kicked in a door I was so freaked out. Man. What a blast
---
even as a staunch supporter of albion, the ads are fucking garbage.  
---
the game itself, if you get into the mid/late game aspects, are AMAZING and seriously bring back the feel of old MMOs. the "wild west" environment, and most importantly the community. the server is global, and in a game where reputation matters, shit gets real.
---
If that's fun for you then sure.
---
On private servers sure
---
Not anymore!
---
While the legendaries and the tower were cool - the path for legendaries was / is aids. Aids aren't fun (so I've heard)
---
Plan your route around hitting a wand quest early.
---
Hey thanks for your concern but everything is under control. I haven't started my actual dream job yet (which of course I would never quit over a game or anything), and also the job I have now is really not great or anything. It's in fact at the far side of town, it's very mundane and there's very little to do. It was simply the first job I got accepted at when I started my applications a few months ago. The pay is good, however, and I live with less than $5 a day in terms of food etc. I've got some big plans for next year, though. We'll see how that goes.
---
Shroud plays where the viewers are, so yea he will be on Classic for a month or two until the hype dies and then move onto the next big thing.
---
I'm pretty sure i've been right-clicking to ignore people in the classic beta.

Yeah some of us already have kids. Our wives have to deal with us now, no going back. Pull the pin on the fat grenade boys
---
Since it scales with level, it's irrelevant. 
---
We're talking about what's better when leveling, agi still provides meaningful crit in addition to the AP and defensives it provides. 
---
That's why it's clear it's the best stat for leveling, especially for a feral tank. Str is still nice though if it's there.
---
If anyone if y’all are worried about life obligations and your schedule permits it. Iv started waking up at 5:30-6 am most days. You can get 3-4 hardcore hours a day of classic and won’t interrupt your daily life for the most part.
---
I have always played a druid and it was my first class. I plan to go with a tauren druid for classic. I reached max level for a druid in every xpac except wow classic where I only played him to level 28. I am a huge raider and pvper and reached the majority of all end content speedily for every xpac. 
---
I plan to heal in PVE and PVP. Going cat in PvP (especially world) sounds very enticing. 
---
Can someone let me know how restoration druids are in WoW classic both in PvE and PvP (world and BG)? How are cats in PvP?:
---
Any information on the state of a resto druid during classic perks my interest.
---
Thx!
---

This pic is fake. Guy on the left is clearly the mage.
---
You probably don't want a dot you can't remove on the target. Serpent sting can be switched with scorpid sting before you use your scatter and/or trap.
---
The druid is great healer for themselves, meaning if druid doesn't want to die, druid runs away doesn't die.
---
However that doesn't leave a ton of mana in the tank to save other players.
---
You should call it "DPS" at that point because when you go OOM you do zero damage and the only thing you can do is stand there being useless.
---
I see you are a man of culture, I tip my hat to you sir.
---
I think faction identity and uniqueness are more important than the handful of people who can’t get their friends to roll one way or another.
---
Class balance doesn’t require an expansion. Had BC not existed those things would have been resolved at some point.
---
I personally prefer 1 button specs over the 5 button (must use in this order) rotations.
---
Felhunter for BGs. Succubus for solo play. There you go.
---
no. red = dead. fight like a true horde. die with honour. 
---
for real though, nothing more satisfying as a warrior to eventually get strong enough to be able to kill the guys who used to beat you easily in PvP. i used to have battles with the same alliance guys as we leveled in the same zone. nothing more satisfying than making that pally, who once used to own me, bubble hearth.
---
but if you're just talking about this 48 hour stress test. just do whatever and enjoy the experience lol
---
You have 2 choices 
---
- wait for quest reward 
---
- be social and join a guild where mats are funneled to a crafter that will send wand users wands
---
P
---
Yea the meme is really awful. Especially considering two major factors; there is a huge amount of orc rogues because it’s technically BiS and that warlocks are absolute PvP gods after T2 gearing.
---
Yeah, that's usually when they counter with "how about you stop standing in fucking fire and blaming me for it."
---
Personally the elitism of WoW is part of what I loved about vanilla. No catering to casuals and rewarded for being more tryhard not that you couldnt still fuck around with meme specs and whatnot for fun sometimes.
---
This interaction reminded me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odMSq0WJ1GM) scene from Coming to America. lol

DEEP WOUNDS. If I don't see at least 10 Deep Wounds icons under the boss's frame then I know someone is using an illegal debuff!

Damn how many players you think there is in a 5 man?
---
&gt; They were hated in their time
---
Maybe go on Wikipedia and look at their actual reception back when they were released. Rember that the CURRENT Rotten Tomatoes rating includes the later backlash.
---
And no one is saying they're "great" now. We just use them for memes.
---
What inevitable content ceiling, U don't think they are going to progress with TBC, WOTLK and beyond? Activision has fucked World of Warcraft once they will do it again.

It's 150g to switch and you have to drop the profession and level it back up first.

I just like games. I dont envy the game they play, just their free time lol.

It's not mandatory but helpful, especially if you plan on tanking at 60.
---
WofF and warriors and rogues are brutal in solo pvp (world or those 1v1 in the BGs).

Priest probably.  You can dispel your bros.  Getting your bros out of cc is pretty huge and only priest can do that on horde.
---
I like being self efficient and not have to rely on others during my leveling process. Which leaves me with option 1 I guess.
---

The only real pro on getting a scorpion as a pet is that poison makes it harder to dispell viper sting. Wind serpent is better on ignoring the armor.

JoW/LoJ for alliance. Alliance's debuff was REALLY tight before the slot boost. Horde had a bit more wiggle room without having judgements to worry about.

I don't think hype has died down. I think a lot of people have stopped following waiting for release. A ton of people wanted beta access and know they won't get it. No reason to look at the beta if they won't get in.
---
This sub is gaining 10k+ people a week. I think we're fine.
---
i fucking hate the last jedi, like i just consider it a disgrace, its fine if people liked it but it was so fucking horrible for me
---
Because pvp doesn't matter.
---
Seeing the arguments in this thread reminds me of the softball and bowling leagues some of my work buddies go to. There are some people there just to be out of the house and don't care if they win. That's fine. Unless you're on a team of guys who are all doing their best and taking this seriously. I'm pretty sure people will sort themselves quickly once we know what the rest of our 'team' looks like.
---
&gt; In Retail, you have tens of thousands of people on connected realms, and the content is so easy, that every 3 guys can sell M+ runs, every 7 guys can sell 10 man flexible raid runs and so on.
---
Can yall stop with this. PvE content on retail that is worth selling is very obviously more challenging than anything that existed in Vanilla.
---
&gt; Since it scales with level, it's irrelevant.
---
No, it's the core of the issue, even with enough agi to gain 1% crit, you need to kill like 15 mobs before it reduces the amount of swings you need to do.
---
You want to bring your meme spec? You’ll never be invited to my group.
---
&gt;\#show Cleave  
---
/cast \[group:party, stance:2\] Cleave  
---
/cast \[equipped:two-hand\] Cleave  
---
/equip &lt;Two\_hand Weapon Name&gt;  
---
So then this would work with 2 consecutive key presses then correct?  If I was Grouped, and in Defensive Stance, it will just cast Cleave with whatever I have equipped... but If I was out solo, and had a Shield equipped, I'd have to hit this macro twice to perform the Cleave with a 2-Hander.
---
The intent is to generate a similar number of attendance "check-ins" per raid night, erring on the side of more check-ins for wiping to new content.  The reason behind this is to make sure that people don't feel that missing a raid night could have a randomly high or low impact to their running 60-day attendance.  You want people to be able to decide to raid or not raid and understand exactly how that will impact their attendance percentage.
---
That's why farm content receives a set number of milestone points for attendance "check-ins".  But the exact check-ins you do varies based upon your guild and its capabilities.
---
If Molten Core is on farm to the point you one-night it, perhaps there's check-ins at Start, after Garr, and after Ragnaros is dead. (or if you can't consistently kill Rag, after Majordomo).  If you're a new/casual guild and i takes you 3-4 nights, maybe more check-ins.  It's all about similar check-ins for a raid night.
---
But yeah, on wiping-to-new-content, you want to reward attendance.  Hence the "hourly check-ins" or whatever makes sense.  Just as long as you announce/schedule what are farm and new-content nights, people will feel in control of their attendance percentage.
---
In my ideal raid it would be:
---
Shadow Weaving
---
Corruption
---
I can see the point you're trying to make, but unless they do a rebalance at some point you are going to intentionally set a lot of people up for dissapointment with advice like this.
---
Trust me, I totally get where you are coming from, but as someone who leveled a Druid and Pally to max level before I even know what raiding was as a kid, it was really crushing to find out that the vast majority of players were going to basically force me into a role I didn't want to be in.
---
Sure, do whatever you want, but if you are even thinking about playing the game long time I think its a really good idea to research the class you were thinking of playing and seeing what is optimal.  After knowing this, if you choose to play a feral druid or ret pally knowing full well people are going to give you shit sometimes for it, by all means go for it, but telling people to just stick their head in the dirt and "have fun" when its going to be significantly harder to just "have fun" if you stick it out with certain classes and specs to end game can end up being an overall negative experience.
---
My Druid was my first 60 and I leveled as feral and was estatic.  I had a blast, but once I reached end game and all my friends that I made in a guild had joined finally started pushing end game I not only got pushed into a healing role that I didn't want to be in, but I was miserable because I felt like I was only there to innervate our priests.  So not only was I in a role I didn't enjoy, but I didn't even feel like I was "good" for that role since all I ever heard during those early MC days was "GJ priests!".
---
I ended up rerolling on another server when the new ones were opened because young me was too timid to even just say "I'm quiting guys because this isn't fun for me" or try to argue for playing an off spec, so yeah.
---
I can get your perspective, but for anybody that wants to stick it out to end game I think its absolutely important to take a gander at what has been learned over the last 15 years about what you're gonna be looking at and the sort of specs that could make grouping hard.  if you're one of those people who's like "man, I would love to tank, I wonder if I should roll a pally or warrior...." a TON of heartache could be avoided with some very basic research.

Can a mod please say whether adding the bot to r/classicwow would be okay?

So this is the GitHub issue: [https://github.com/bobby-b-bot/reddit/issues/2](https://github.com/bobby-b-bot/reddit/issues/2)
---
It would be great if any one of you could respond on reddit whether adding the bot would be okay or not. It's mainly a bot active in r/freefolk and we figured there are many of the freefolk here in this sub (I already saw a lot of posts making references to r/freefolk) so we'd love to have that bot here. Canihaveplz?
---
Memories. That was great.

If you don’t mind feeling like shit eat snacks that have large amounts of carbohydrates so you have a big insulin spike, and then shortly after you’ll crash and feel like you really need a nap. This is where you bring in the caffeine to counteract this.

Or you could prepare balanced meals ahead of time like steak, rice and broccoli, put that in Tupperware containers and just microwave one when you’re hungry.

Bodom and Slipknot mid 2000s? that must have been sick as fuck.
---
It changes for everyone when they do the quest.
---
I'm not too familiar with horde quests, I get one at level 13 as alliance though.
---
One was added in vanilla, one wasn’t.
---
Which... to be fair... did solidify my desire to play warlock. 1v2'ing against tips and a shaman in a tower and winning filled me with joy.
---
You must have not played vanilla then. This is what every PvP Ret and Warrior did. Sit afk in AV for rep for Unstoppable Force. Raiding was too nerdy for us.

You can’t leech in classic and not be noticed.

One one ticket to blacklist city, can’t wait!

that’s not going to happen and I’m sorry that you even think that’s a possibility.

Amateur, You should've kept the kids and put em on farming duty.

Right. But If I do it and you don’t we no longer exist in the same world.
---
It is there so Blizzard can stress test the effect that layering will have on ERP in Goldshire.
---
The most accurate one yet!!
---
Making a three month long beta and then not actually even testing all the content would be pretty fucking stupid.
---
this shouldn't be an issue because if what you say is actually true, then those people who you say will lose "hype" by watching or leveling to 60 in the beta will lose that same hype a month or so after classic release anyway, and it's a wash either way. Who cares? If anything, it's a good thing because that means less people in the starting areas come release. I dont mind sharing a starting area with people who will stick around for at least a year over the people who lose the hype and quit in a month or so.

I saw a streamer dropped staff of Jordan on beta. I would have been so mad, that stuff never happens xD
---
&gt; Also if you go sl wotf is basically a non issue since you can sac while stunned
---
Assuming you have a VW out, which you won't always. As a Mage, the Felhunter is a much much bigger threat due to the high resistances and the counterspell that can be used even when the Warlock is CCed or interrupted.
---
Tidal Charm is pretty rare I think (?). I remember a guildie tried to farm it back in the day and never got it. And that was before everyone and their mom knew BiS items for PvP and was camping that mob.
---
Still though, how the hell do you lose against a mage as Warlock? Not in a dueling situation, but in the world. Between Healthstone, 60+ resistances, super high health, fear, Lolcoil, a silence you can cast at any time... how the hell do you lose? Especially before spellpen becomes a thing.
---
I'm certainly not influenced by what I read on reddit (that's a pretty ignorant statement). I've been playing this game since Beta and played Mage throughout all of classic. 
---
Engineering can change some matchups around but I'm not sure if I like this as a balance argument. Everyone can pick it up and I think "if you want to have a shot at PvP you need to be Engi" is ... suboptimal.
---
For base classes, Warlocks dominated mages. Their entire kit was anti mage. Mages had no fear break on their PvP trinket and going up against someone with 60+ resistances in all schools of magic is ... a diceroll. Couple the high resistances with Soul Link damage reduction, Healthstones and lolcoil heal and there is no way a Mage can reliably take down a Warlock.
---
MAYBE once every 10 minutes when Evo and Iceblock are up and you get lucky with resists but I'd still bet my money on the Warlock. The PBE dueling tournament was lvl30, that's hardly a great representation of PvP balance as many key skills are missing.
---
Sledgehammer parties are fun... or so I hear.

Have you updated your bnet launcher today? I didn’t have the option for classic until I updated
---
Especially silly characters like Tauren female druids and human male mages. I welcome the magic circus clown overlords!
---
Good as an off-tank.  You don't really get tank oriented gear until AQ if you're raiding.  5 man, more than enough to work since your bonus to threat generation is blessing of salvation on memebers of the group.  
---
You're not going to main tank every raid boss, but they can be a substantial off-tank on fights.  But I would say Paladin tanks came much more viable in TBC.  But I think if there's a will, there's a way, and you can make it happen.
---
The other guy is way overstressing gear dependence for a warlock. Warlocks ARE more gear dependent than a mage in a raid setting because they don’t have natural spell hit talents and blizzard started putting spell hit on gear pretty late.
---
You will still own in dungeon blues, much more so imo than a hunter in blues, and the fact that you are missing +hit will matter a lot less of you’re not consistently raiding (and if you are the problem fixes itself anyway!)
---
That's the kinda logic that will get me to sub.
---
And they don't take their pet aggro off ffs
---
Upvote here and maybe we'll get him there. Let's get him to r/classicwow 💪
---
Not this one.
---
They've already answered but it would be a good idea to level in your respective zones until about 14-15 and then hit westfall or darkshore together. One person will have to make the trip to another city to train skills. Just keep an eye on which skills are really mandatory (train resurrection). Good luck!
---
There letters.
---
&gt; people will be forced to watch streamers clear endgame content for weeks until release
---
Noone is forced to do anything.
---
Watching streamers is a choice, I'm not doing it because I don't care at all about them, but that's me.
---
&gt; many people will lose their hype for the game
---
So be it. It would help weaning out some of the tourists.
---
If you lose hype just by watching someone else playing a game that *isn't out yet* you wouldn't have lasted long anyway IMO. You're better off before it even begins.
---
The inevitable, deep wounds.
---
Oops, you're right. No idea where I saw that 50 number.
---
They are already not raising it to 60
---
We have been asking for months since Ion said he thinks they are to niche. This just adds to the pile. If we got a blue post saying “yes we are going to have a RPPVP realm in each time zone” or no we are not. We would be better off.
---
Maybe a bit too wholesome. They should just keep on thinking it sucks and prefer Fortnite etc.
---
"Underappreciated in their time" is the most diplomatic way of saying "dumpster fire" I've ever seen.  Bad + Time = Kitsch?
---
I got the stress test in my launcher and I do not have an active us sub. My friend also got it and doesn't have an active sub at all so I think they still add some randoms to the list
---
Druids can progression main tank all but 3 raid bosses in the game. Nelth, and saph and Spider from naxx. 
---
1.12 Druids are 100% viable tanks, and bring distinct advantages over warriors in terms of threat, secondary threat, rage generation and gear independence.
---
Shock-a-din it is. Gonna make bunch of memish role playing macroses and try to outdps tank
---
I'm really enjoying tanking with a Warrior right now and it's messing with my head. :/ I just love helping people with quests or that people invite me to dungeons and stuff.
---
But I was so settled on Lock.
---
Look, I get what you're trying to accomplish, but what you're trying to accomplish is, figuratively, pissing your pants.
---
You're reducing your skill ceiling to increase your skill floor.
---
Just get used to manually weapon swapping instead you'll have much much better results.
---
A) In Classic WoW you hang out in Ironforge waiting to fill your dungeon and raid group.
---
B) If your dungeon or raid group wipes you need to spend time to refill it.
---
I've told many people about running a guild and the fact that you that you HAVE to run it as a business. You have to have a separation of duties. People will burn out if they're handling too much.

Aka loot council

Bow rogue.

Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Shaman &gt; Druid
---
That was a waste of money. The min specs are listed on Battle.net
---
Doesn't bother me at all. WoW had Battlegroups for a long time that probably each contained more PvPers than the Classic BG scene will have, and they worked fine. You recognized frequent PvPers and guilds from your battle group and it wasn't really an issue that it was x-realm.
---
It’s 7pm EST.
---
If you care about PvP then orc is far and away the best choice, the stun racial is way too good to pass up. As far as PvP racials go I want to say night elf is probably the worst race for a warrior but that depends on whether you value shadowmeld over things that actually help in combat (stoneform, escape artist, perception).
---
If you're lucky enough to get paid for streaming a video game, maybe choose one (or choose an avenue in one) that doesn't give the general public the opportunity to exploit it. Seeing someone streaming themselves farming is as if to say "I know you know where I am, I dare you to do someone about it". Any grievance caused by this is completely warranted, and any notion of penalizing players for taking advantage of this is mindbogglingly idiotic. The onus is not on the public to uphold consideration, its either on the streamers to be prepared for the attention they're spotlighting on themselves, or on the streamers to explore areas of the game not impacted by the possible presence of others. 
---
Streamers in general seem to think the game revolves around them, but the cold hard truth is that they're lucky to have this game to revolve around.
---
The distance between monitor and bathroom is 12 meters. I think 100 meters a day are enough for a walk out. Or walk in. You decice.

Apparently I'm not very thorough but I've been in this sub a while and never seen a single mention of it

Amen brother, preach on...

I do plan on raiding, but I do not plan on raid leading again. There's too much involved and I don't know that I could dedicate the time again.

The hardcore private server community and nochangers are idiots. They have no real arguement for or against things other than that it was or wasnt in vanilla which is a stupid arguement.

That'll be much more bearable. Still a kinda huge downside for Ally locks but damn those 20 seconds were just utterly ridiculous.
---
This isn't nostalgia.this was nostralius shutting down.
---
i think what they should do is let people queue up for bgs from anywhere and don't do xrealm.
---
xrealm means everybody sits in the city and queues up an instantly gets a bg and never goes out in the world.
---
no xrealm means people queue up and sit around doing nothing while waiting for a queue so they're still not going out in the world.
---
queue from anywhere means you can play while waiting for a bg so you won't need instant bgs or waiting around all day hoping.
---
What about the SJW droid and Lando Calrissian’s romantic interest in it?
---
Only 2 warlocks? Gonna want more than that for MC with garr.
---
You obviously did not play Vanilla before cross realm bgs. It was a nightmare, you have to realize cross realm came out of a necessity.
---
all races have 2 arms
---
I was a raid leader and assistant guild leader from Vanilla all through Wotlk. I wouldn‘t do it again. Sure, a well executed run felt great. The whole guild appreciated our commitment but the time and effort we invested were just crazy. I don‘t even have a fraction of the free time I had back then. So no I won‘t do it again. I‘m not even sure I want to get back into the raiding scene at all.
---
Slightly sad to see we have so many warriors now, because people know how strong they can be despite their weak leveling.
---
At least it frees up more ranged spots, guess I get to try something new this time around. S/O to all those horde palys and ally shamans.
---
I agree. I'll probably do PVP via world raids to capital cities and policing people's world buffs off because fuck them
---
You can actually buy Lesser Magic Essences, 8 silver each.
---
Brown/White Linen Robe sells for 1 silver, so rather than disenchanting them just sell them to scrape the needed 16 silver.
---
+wep skill is pretty much a non-issue in PvP, I'd take Shadowmeld over it any day in pvp.
---
Non-human furies can also find a nice niche picking up all the axes that the combat rogues and human furies are passing on since they want to leverage their wep skill racial. You can somewhat bridge the gap with Edgemaster's handguards, and the raid will appreciate somebody actually wanting the gear.
---
And Ashkandi is hunter loot
---
it does nearly no damage
---
Barrens
---
Solo was really good imo. Top tier
---
Woo
---
It's no different. Thing is PvP players will defend it so they don't have to wait for the que. It's no changes until it regards PvP then anything is OK to change as long as it's in their favor.
---
5+3+X=100
---
Not in my group, i simply dont inv them. I am tank.
---
Retail servers are 3500 cap, not like private servers with 7k+ , thats why we need X realm bgs
---
The dungeons were amazing, the raids were good, pvp and pve were both far more diverse as classes and specs were far more balanced. The dailies gave us something to do in the end game between raids other than just farming mats or gold. Flying was cool at first, but I will agree that that one was just a mistake (RIP WPvP). The original LFG tool was a great system for people who didn't have an active friend group to find groups. 
---
The fact that blizzard took those mechanics way too far in later expansions doesn't detract from the fact that TBC was a great expansion to a great game.
---
Taking a good thing too far will (and in this case did) ruin it. Doesn't mean it was never a good thing.
---
Druid it is. /s
---
Low level instances aren't difficult on private servers either, are you going to tell me with a straight face that you've struggled with deadmines and stockades?
---
Queue times would be terrible without it.    Also, pvp doesn't matter anywhere near as much as pve.  It's just something you do on the side.  Doesn't matter basically.
---
Just until I do it. It's a limited measure to allow for organic world progressing and for quests to have a tangible effect.
---
Wow almost like stressing the login servers is part of the test.
---
LOL I know right, no one here is talking 40 man raids guy.

Paladin is by far the easiest healer.

Thousand Needles and Tanaris
---
They didnt call it World of Warcrack for nothing
---
The big problem to me, is the streamers that are so much in their own head.  They don't realize there is a world outside of their gaming room.  They will go on a tirade and take it personally if they are killed, camped, their server goes down, or someone criticises them harshly.  
---
Stopping wow for a period of time is a legitimate strategy to getting past the griefing in a PVP server.  As is asking for help in guild then waiting around as a ghost until help arrives and complaining about dying.  There really isn't a perogative for people to leave you alone unless they have something better to do than fight you.  As a final note, some one is going to lose in a PVP fight.  Maybe viewers stopped watching an individual streamer, not because they were getting corpse camped, but because their reaction of attempting the figurative "forcing a square peg through a round hole" turned off a large number of viewers.
---
this is so accurate lol
---
damnit lol
---
Inconceivable! 
---
It's clearly about stressing the player base!!
---
Nothing can battle Classic hrrrrrr
---
Stream viewers make up a tiny tiny tiny fraction of actual player base. Even if you combine retail stream viewers with classic beta viewers. Still just a tiny fraction.
---
Holy pal is #1 both in PvP end PvE
---
Offer a wand for a stack of linen in /1 if you run out of mats.
---
Keeping the warlock and having a priest go holy weaving is much better anyways.
---
I believe as the skill level of your opponent increases, the value of Troll also increases (not relevant in a few matchups). I don’t think you’re going to reasonably be feared in coordinated 10v10 WSG, therefore I think that Troll is slightly better than Undead in coordinated matchups, and Undead is better than Troll in open world, uncoordinated PvP.
---
Troll also has a single global, triple charge ability that proceeds Blackout and Shadow Weaving (Shadowguard), as well a long range 20% healing debuff curse.
---
Berserking Mindblast is one of the most difficult spells to interrupt in the game, and using it with Mana Burn turns Mana Burn into an absolute machine.
---
Undead animations are better. Lol.
---
Devouring Plague is almost entirely irrelevant in coordinated PvP as it’s likely to get instantly dispelled.
---
That’s my opinion as it sits right now.
---
I see a lot of people asking about the best race, best class, the fastest route to 60. Everything best, according to what some stranger on the internet says. I'm not going to tell people how to have their fun. But I won't be treating classic so "clinical". I'll pick the race I want to play, the class I want, the spec I want. I don't care if it's middle DPS. I'm the one spending my money and time, so why would I play the way someone else wants.
---
I admit I won't be in the top 1% of raiders. Best of luck to everyone trying for those spots.
---
Oh yeah, forgot about blood fury! Orc does seem like the more rational choice
---
Or Darth Maul being alive...
---
Sounds like people actually having fun playing the game to me
---
Yeah that's sort of what I'm getting at :P
---
They're hypocrites.  
---
They're getting paid for people watching them. They more people watch, the more they get paid.  They happily take that money and beg for more.  They can't, then, turn around and scream STREAM SNIPING (aka, people were watching them, which is their whole fucking purpose for existing.)
---
Your argument about "passion" is a joke.  If they just had passion for playing the game, they'd be fine playing it without broadcasting their stupid face out to the world.  They have a passion for attention.  For people following them, and giving them their approval in the form of eyeballs and likes and clicks and donations.  
---
They're whores.  If they want to be whores, they can't complain when a dick comes knocking at their hole.
---
WoD was shit
---
Please find me the minimum specifications for Classic. But, either way, the point is to show people how various system configurations will work with Classic.
---
Human for sure for sword rogues, could go mace with Emp Demolisher.
---
That being said, I played a Gnome rogue back in vanilla, top tier guild who cleared naxx, combat daggers in raiding.  Had a moment where I went swords with Nightmare Blade + Maladath and didn't understand why I did so much damage (later learned about +weapon skill benefits).  Granted, we didn't have any human rogues that were swords (all were daggers or ended up quitting late game) but I wasn't having issues trading the #1 DPS slot on fights as a combat dagger rogue.  If you're good at rotations, maximze damage, you'll still be up there on damage.
---
If going daggers, Core Hound Gloves is an early molten core drop with +daggers, +dagger belt from dire maul, +dagger offhand from DM, +dagger helm from green dragons, +daggers on Death's Sting on C'Thun.  So you won't really be lacking on +daggers needed to do good combat dagger builds.

[Do you?](https://classic.wowhead.com/mage-quests#0+3+11)
---
Louder for the neckbeards in the back!
---
do we have to start new characters for this test? The last one we kept ours but this time there are a bunch  of servers so we must have to re-level right?
---
doesn't hunter also have track stealthed. So I assume its separate from the humanoid tracking.
---
Yeah but Battle Groups absolutely existed in Classic albeit the end.
---
Moonkins with extremely little MP5 can last 3x that long. They have mana pots, dark runes and they have the option of innervating themselves if needed. MP5 is only useful on fights longer than 2 and a half minutes; which isn't many in the grand scheme of things during Vanilla.
---
Do it to get TUF then stop.  Just like in Vanilla.
---
you can kill rag with 40ppl full green.
---
So yes, rag will be down W1
---
Poor euros lol
---
Definitely DPS. If he was a healing paladin, he'd have devout shoulders. :P
---
No chance. The server is new, the record is from a hunter.
---
Idk, how?
---
&gt; nothing from classic crippled the game further down the line
---
Instanced dungeons and instanced battlegrounds were ABSOLUTELY HUGE, both in their deviation from previous MMOs and in leading to the game WoW is today, where the world might as well be instanced and the cities a matchmaking lobby.
---
People will be lvl 60 before it's gone, how does it not make a difference?
---
Forming dungeons and raids in classic WoW took time. Sometimes a long time, because you have to fill the groups with players from your own server. Why not have Dungeon and Raid Finder in Classic so players don't have to wait.
---
That afk area one strikes home to me, ugh so annoying what's the point of it.
---
Paladin is by far the easiest healer to play. Paladins are fantastic healers in classic anyway...  might as well go Paladin.
---
Coffee and cocaine
---
Can't say for sure, I didn't get into the last ones
---
It’s a very common problem in a lot of areas, actually. Anywhere that doesn’t have a total fertility rate of like 2.1 is going to have long term problems. Both China and Japan aren’t really anywhere near the necessary number.
---
That's because every answer you can't wrap your dim little head around sounds like bullshit to you. That just means that you're dim, not that it's bullshit.
---
I like how the stream he ends with after is him in scarlet monestary and completely unrelated to his AV weekend stream
---
As a warlock... I'm cool if there is one in the raid. If there isnt I'm not too bothered. I plan to avoid them in PvP at all costs.
---
40 ppl week 1 all level 60...?
---
I actually played a night elf warrior on a private server a few years back, and I did find shadowmeld quite useful, for example when fighting other warriors to ensure that you get to charge first, or when defending the WSG flag room or AB bases. Also great when eating to regain health. However, the stun resist does seem way more impactful overall
---
Not likely unless the make it open which I don’t think they should do
---
What spec are you using?
---
I played Rogue all through Vanilla and again on Pservers and never once felt underpowered.
---
His body was restored in the cartoon series Star Wars: Clone Wars.
---
Are you sure you need a copper rod to make the wand? I didn't think that it was necessary.
---
Yes, you'll have to try on RNG. You might need to disenchant more robes to get the essence. The vendor near the enchanting trainer will also sell a limited essence, but you shouldn't rely on that.
---
I believe that weapons are more likely to disenchant to essences. If you have a green staff by level 10 you could try to disenchant that.

That is an improvement.
---
Shards don't exist unless the pop warrants it either, it's the same technology but with the cross realm value turned to 0.
---
If you want a uniqueness for Warlock, you'll be a main tank on the Twin Emps fight in AQ40.
---
Sounds like they had fun though which is what this post is about.
---
Amen
---
so if someone asks about boomkins in pve it would be alright to say that they are amazing if they dont specify raids/dungeons? I mean, they are pretty good at killing a single mob out in the world. Its PvE you know
---
Instanced dungeons weren’t bad. As for battlegrounds I don’t think they should of existed at all.
---
Strongly disagree, MoP WoD and BFA are all absolute shit, should be in another category.
---
At least part of it was. Toots &amp; the maytals - 54-46 was my number
---
I've been narrowing down my choices. I am bouncing between Warlock, Mage, and Rogue at this point. I will be playing Horde. My main focus of the game will be world pvp and raiding. I want large scale world pvp battles and solo pvp to be my focus, with raiding to get the progression and feed gear to myself for better pvp. I will also occasionally do bgs, but, I do not want to do the ranking grind, it would just be occasional fun.
---
ROGUE:
---
I like the flavor of rogue, I enjoy the rotation in pve, I love being a dick and ganking people, and it is probably my most played class in wow. However, I'm a bit discouraged because I know they generally are bad in big team battles, which I want to do in classic, both in the world and in occasional bgs. I also am concerned about overpopulation and not getting spots or gear easily at all. Lots of competition. 
---
MAGE: 
---
I love the flexibility of the talent points, quality of life this class brings, and the pvp playstyle. I also love that this class is good at ALL areas in pvp and isn't that gear reliant, so right from the beginning I can be competitive and have fun in pvp, and I know that I'll have a pretty safe raid spot in pve the entire experience of classic. The gold farming will be crazy too. I'm concerned about the fact that the class is overpopulated, since people know how good it is. I'm worried about competition of gear for that reason and also being one of the billion undead mages trying to be Vurtne. I also find leveling mages boring.
---
WARLOCK:
---
I love the flavor and theming and visuals of this class. This is probably my favorite class in the game thematically. I also know that in gear, it becomes a pvp powerhouse. I also do find it fun to level as, which does matter in classic. I also feel like since raids bring less warlocks, I'd get my tier sets faster than the other classes and warlock tier sets are known to be good in pvp, even if they're bad in pve. I am concerned about the gear dependence, though. I'm also worried about early vanilla pvp before I start to get epics and stuff, being free kills. Sure, becoming good with gear will be fun down the line, but right off the bat it will be a frustrating experience watching mages and rogues and hunters have a ton of fun while I'm waiting for my turn. 
---
Thoughts on what I should play?
---
I'm not sure if it will happen but you do NOT have to get BIS farms to clear MC and the attunement is a joke.
---
It just requires 40 people who have done the content in the past. The struggle is getting 40 people to make up a raid composition and have them level to 60 in the first week.
---
I mean he just answered that..
---
Horde. Hello, I'm an alliance player, but you sure cant argue with windfury on an arms warrior.
---
Crossrealm BGs are the same thing as Dungeon and Raid Finder. So many are in denial. Blizzard tricked them and just applied the same system to PvE.
---
I was rocking a really shitty dell computer with dial up. Was only able to kill some wolves. Had to mostly go play at a friends house on their beefy computer
---
This has been debated a lot and there's a pretty even split of thinking either way. There are definitely private server guilds that are planning to try it.
---
First off, you don't need all 40 members to be 60. You can have some dps under 60. Second you absolutely do not need BiS. Your tank needs to farm some gear. Other than that you're just gonna take what you can get in a short amount of time.
---
The MC attunement is a non-issue. It's very short to complete in a dungeon you're gonna be running to get your tank some gear anyway. The hydraxian rep can be mage AoE farmed. You just need a handful of people at honored. 
---
The biggest (and only real significant one) is the leveling. The rest of the stuff can be knocked out in short order and the instance itself is not particularly difficult, especially for a guild that's been working together a lot on pservers already and have a pretty good plan in place. 
---
My money is on it being done, but I wouldn't be surprised if they fail.
---
Yeah probably gonna go pally 3/3
---
More like frustration, so very hard to kill
---
&gt;these polls are mainly answered by people who care enough about the game to take polls about it
---
which is not even close to a significant sample size, hence, "survey is worthless"
---
PUBG maps host like 50 players max per map. The streamsniper just makes sure to enter the queue at roughly the same second as the streamer and they are likely to be put in the same server
---
Yeah that's very true! Except the part about Ashkandi &gt;:(
---
Can people even get to rag before the end of the week?  I guess if they farmed rep from respawning trash.  Or does the regular run allow for the Hydraxian quest completion to put out the runes and summon Majordomo?
---
Difficulty wise it will be very doable.  Time wise it just takes the kind of people who live on Monsters, Redbulls, and 8 balls, and will invest a ridiculous amount of effort for... a Molten Core clear.  Let that sink in.
---
Hell yea. I’m just gonna go UA from the Air Force. What’s the worst that can happen, I’ll worry about it later.
---
Damn, there are 23 shamans on alliance and 34 paladins on the horde. I'm impressed!
---
i don't make the rules. people will play hunters no matter how good or bad they are. 
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20050811003859/http://warcraftrealms.com/census.php
---
It’s less an issue of having enough gear, and more an issue of having enough people.
---
If your expected raiders end up having connection issues or get fucked and get behind on the Zerg for whatever reason, it’s gonna be real hard to make it.
---
How do you spell levlliing
---
Does MC require rep from the Waterlords still for the fires?  If so, that's another grind to do by people unless you are killing a boss, go outside summon one guy, have him port, repeat.
---
What else is there to do if you can't read or write
---
He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man
---
Forming Raids and Dungeons can take a long time. Sometimes up to an hour to find a tank for Scholomance. Why not just skip the wait times and add some Dungeon Finder?
---
Same for me.
---
if you end up arms with sword spec, a sword spec proc will reset the timer. so you try to time your instants(extra chances at sword proc) for right after a swing/hit if possible
---
And u get kicked from raid after 1 boss. For doing 50dps over whole fight.
---
i think everyone has an opinion on the internet and it's not worth the energy to police if it's 'alright'
---
but that's just what i think, lmao
---
anyway, boomkins are amazing &lt;3
---
Replacing someone mid raid is a huge pain.
---
Both!
---
Reddit mod xD
---
I really liked Solo, I'm not sure why people give it so much flak.
---
Imagine crippling yourself financially so you can complain a game doesn't have enough content. XD
---
Blizzard tricked you.
---
Indeed, windfury + sword spec + hand of justice sounds like a lot of fun
---
Unfortunally it do need a rod for the wand.
---
Yea, the thing is there is no enchanting supplies npc in Brill, only in UC and Silverpine which have 1 in stock each and that is a long run to do.. Maybe worth it tho?
---
You need 7..or 8, I don't remember, of the vials that you can get for being honored. You can get rep from mobs out in the world.
---
M10 is nothing. You're not going to PUG 15, 20, and certainly not 25 or 26. You're also not going to pug the latests Mythic raids. And you're not going to pug high rating Arena.
---
Retail has much more to offer a competitive player than Classic does.
---
I honestly don’t KNOW people like that. Like ever. I’ve met some gnarly dudes in college you pulled some crazy all nights and could party, study and repeat with 3.6 gpa... but it just blows my mind that ppl would do this or even attempt it
---
Wekk 2? Certainly. Week one will be tough, as you'll be stretching having 40 people in a guild lv 60 in 1 week.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen beta footage of people popping out, consuming a potion, then back in a single macro press. The transition is instant so there shouldn't be any risk. The model stays bear, all you can see is the puff of smoke. The only downside is the loss of rage, but with Furor talent that's not really a huge deal. 
---
You might be able to do something similar with Barkskin, I'm not sure how the GCDs work out off the top of my head.
---
That's cool, I never knew that one.
---
dungeon and raid finder are designed to exploit impulsive behaviour. we call this instant gratification, or choosing now over later. it's inherently bad for the social environment to each server because the compromise is compulsive behaviour over stronger social networks.   
---
cross realm battlegrounds is entirely for balancing purposes so you don't accidentally end up in a situation where people are discouraged from playing PvP because they always end up losing to the other faction.
---
someones jelly
---
Just expect to be spamming hamstring all raid. Fishing for procs.
---
as much as people hate cata and mop, they were probably my favorite times AFTER said classic "era" of wow, they were good in their own ways. In no way were they perfect, but cata was a nice fresh take on azeroth (even thought it got old really quickly) and had nice difficult raid encounters, and the best dungeon difficulty so far, and MOP had some of the most amazing scenery and music feel that the game has ever had.
---
&gt;So far 4 days and 20 hours is the record for leveling. That’s 116 hours of gameplay.
---
Many speed levelers are expecting sub 100 hours to 60 (I expect 110-120 paladin). With enough speedlevelers on the server, it's definitely possible.
---
- NA: Launch is Mon 8/26 @ 3:00pm
---
- 1st server reset should be Tue 9/3 (likely at 5am)
---
- That's 182 hours available to kill Ragnaros
---
So with 6 hours of sleep a night, speedrunners might have 40 hours to farm gear, level professions, and do MC attempts. Full BIS is not needed for MC - it's doable with a few pieces. Attunement is like an hour. Slightly slower will have 30 hours, 20, 10, etc.
---
If they want 10 hours to attempt it:
---
- 10 will have 30 hours to prep
---
- 10 will have 20 hours to prep
---
- 10 will have 10 hours to prep
---
- 10 warm bodies @ lvl 58+ will show up.
---
^ that group should be able to clear MC.
---
I can't decide between a hunter or a feral druid.   What should I play?  
---
I am a loot whore.  I want loots.  
---
I want to be able to farm gold easily.
---
I like doing dungeons, but they're hard to form as a dps.  3 dps LF tank and healer aren't LFM, they're LFG.
---
I like solo'ing content.  
---
I might have to make both, but I need to know which to make first for raiding.
---
Pay attention like everyone else? Rofl seriously?
---
Well after watching some videos I decided for hunter, either dwarf, nelf or orc. But most likely nelf because of shadowmeld :) (or maybe dwarf because of stoneform lol)
---
God you people love to whine. If you kill someone be prepared to deal with their friends
---
Thank you. I guess it should have been obvious but I had no idea what I was reading.
---
I'm exact opposite.  Was sure i'd be playing Warrior and tanking (on Alliance) because it's completely different to the troll priest I mained in classic.  Now,  The idea of playing a warlock (I leveled an undead in classic) and really digging in to the class sounds like alot of fun.
---
&gt; Is warlock not viable at all in blues?
---
Yes they are
---
You seem like the kind of rogue who wants to ambush backstab cold blood eviscerate and expect the enemy to be dead in the meanwhile. You used the word backstab about 10 times in the post and had zero mention to any other skill. That's not how a rogue plays. You need to control the fight, take your time and adapt.  You can't hope to burst damage only and expect the other guy to sit and take it.
---
Seems to me you need more practice playing rogue.
---
Tauren is sexy and hearty af. Orc is mechanically more badass, but kinda fugly.
---
Speaking as a vanilla mage, try felhunter. Those were more terrifying than full classes. 
---
I remember multiple times where a warlock would stay at max range letting his pup solo me.
---
Thank you NA Horde Hunters for not making us the least played class in every bracket.
---
Thing is most off tanks are fury so idk how true this is. 
---
If I remember correctly you only bring like max 2 deep prot warriors
---
[Yes](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5604/elven-wand)
---
It's 45% passive stun resist with talents. Everyone has a 5% passive stun resist, Orcs get another 25%.
---
The fear here is of interacting with other people and not getting a solution that works for you / the majority. But that is a worthwhile risk in exchange for a system that forces people to communicate with and get to know each other. The only risk-free solution wouldn't be a classic experience.
---
&gt;  If someone sees a lock, and tries to run, there is not much a lock can do to stop them.
---
What about curse of exhaustion? Doesnt that slow their opponent down by like 50% or 70% or something? Can't a warlock just put that on a runner, and they'd be fucked?
---
Holy fuck why are people asking questions based around specific specs and talents!! I think you should be asking yourself what storyline entices you more. What race appeals to you more. Which zones you're more excited to quest in and create your adventures in.
---
Who cares which faction is 'better' for a particular spec. Hell, you can't really objectively say. Just pick whatever you like the most at the character creation and roll with it. There will always be someone performing and being better than you no matter what, so it's pretty much pointless to try and min-max this. WoW was never a great game to min-max in anyway.
---
Just go in and have fun!
---
Bank alt for UC.
---
That depends, blues would be mainly through 5-10-20man content where epics (purple) are from more expensive/rare crafting recipes, rare/later 10 and 20man boss drops as well as 40raids.  Keep in mind the competition for those 40 man drops.  PvP wise, the epic gear (when added in) would most likely be a little hard/unattainable due to the excruciating grind involved.
---
*cough* just create a US trial account on your battle net account and thank me later *cough*
---
&gt;It turns out you can't predict fun with numbers
---
Hahaha nice. You can predict profits tho. Pretty sure that's all most game companies care about now.
---
There's not much fun in paying $30 for an in game pet, but people seem more than willing to do it.
---
Good point, that's even better
---
Because vanilla is hard. 
---
When you're in the mid-levels, hybrid or non-tank spec "tanks" will definitely impact the group. I played a healer through vanilla and non-prot warriors are squishier even in the right gear. It can be done, but the "it's just a normal dungeon what's the big deal" attitude we have now does not fly in vanilla.
---
More damage to the tank means more MP spent by the healer. Mana isn't infinite in vanilla and has to be carefully managed. More mana spent means more downtime drinking, which also isn't as fast as it is now. Mage water might suck depending on the level break, even if it is available, so water costs go up. It also means the potential for more potion use. All of this carries the risk of more death/wipes which costs time and repair money. 
---
Everyone has costs in dungeon runs. By not respeccing, the tank is pushing part of his own costs to the rest of the group (mostly the healer) even if everything goes perfectly. But if a pull goes poorly, not having those prot tree abilities will cause a wipe as opposed to a close call. Running back to dungeons takes much longer in vanilla.
---
Unless you are overgeared (at which point why dungeon run?), there is no excuse for tanking in the wrong spec. With the talent trees you have some flexibility, and you'll always need a little down the fury tree, but if you're not built to tank, then you will not succeed as a tank.
---
I mean yeah, he is. But Hunter is not mobile at all. Just about any class can daze you if you use Cheetah.
---
The fear here is of interacting with other people and not getting a solution that works for you / the majority. But that is a worthwhile risk in exchange for a system that forces people to communicate with and get to know each other. Risk-free solutions wouldn't be a classic experience.
---
Leveling seems like the easiest thing to fix, you simply share accounts.
---
I loved questing in the Hinterlands the first time, felt like the whole zone was a hidden gem, and the outside troll dungeon was the shit.
---
25% stun resist = Orc.
---
/endthread
---
Tauren. Date hp buff tho
---
Cata wouldnt be the fucking phantom menace. Ugh
---
on a potential population of over 1 million? that's only 2%.
---
plus, as you said, it's not even sampling the general population.it's like only asking bfa players what they think about classic and claiming nobody cares about classic.
---
there is *no world* in which more people play warlock than rogue or hunter.
---
&gt; Doesn’t speed leveling require pots and everything else that’s already sustained on a server?
---
No. You can speed level on an empty server solo/self-found in 100-120 hours.
---
The only "necessary" ones are thunder clap and demo shout. If you're worried about DPS, add in sunder and the curses. Everything else isn't make-or-break.
---
I tried Dagger spec 16/12/23 (with improved Sprint) using Perditions Blade and Hemo 23/3/25 using Grand Marshall's 1h sword.
---
That's why I don't like watching him.
---
Nice what spec were you playing?  
---
I had a lot of fun on mage, it was the 60 I mained the longest in vanilla. Had top kills one AV last weekend as POM/pryro, named the mage Pureskill.
---
i will read while im going to the objective's location
---
Priest is the easiest you just drop renew and heals on guys.
---
Yeah, been thinking about firing up the old war drims and guild leading in this. But 40 man raid guild. *sudders* ive always failed in wow by not recruiting hard enough and player turnover kill the guild by not having enough to raid.
---
Thunderfury was never handled by DKP, it was deducted from it but the choice was always made by council.
---
Loot council is great for 20 man's but has no place in 40 man raids when you only get 2-4 pieces of loot off a boss. Top performers get away with not showing up to raids, get away with murder or end up destroying your guild by quitting.
---
Way better to stem loot drama, make a much more even spread of loot across the guild than to beef up 15 dudes who blow the GM and get special treatment.
---
Go orc or go home
---
&gt; Is it a bad idea to meet romantic partners in the work place too?
---
Depends on the company and the structure at play. Dating someone from another department is juggling matchsticks but fallout won't be bad if things go sour. Now if you go around asking your subordinates out then Jesus Christ you are juggling blow torches with your ass cheeks.
---
Very good point.
---
From questing Darkshore a couple times on pservers I have found drop rates to be horrendous for the Buzz box quest. I'm wondering if it is even worth to do any past the first for early exp.
---
Speedrun a warrior as a world's first you casual
---
Damn, what spec are you using? Should I not being using Nightslayer set maybe?
---
nothing?
---
you aren't tracking NPC who sit in a static area and never move... you are trying to track someone who might not even be there.
---
Alliance generally is a tad better in PvE due to blessings, and I agree that the dodge is better than the HP increase from Tauren. Not sure there are many situtations it truly matters, but it's there.
---
Now I'm mostly a PvP player so my views might be skewed, but I think War Stomp is an incredibly powerful tool. Especially since you can reliably use it, whereas blessings require a Pala willing to either spend gold on mats or rebuff you every 5 minutes. In premades - sure, you'll get that. Solo-queing for BGs, probably not so much after the start of the BG. 
---
At the end of the day, I'd argue neither race is so much better that you should make your decisions based on that - I'd just try to figure out if I wanted to play Horde or Alliance if I were OP
---
Yup. That sounds familiar!
---
Imo some time your gotta move forward right? I'd bet my ass if you just keep gaming and don't do anything else you'd regret it. 
---
I have very limited gaming time now but am happier than ever. Turns out having a kid is fucking amazing. Sure I wish I could game more sometimes but then I remember back when all I did was game and I felt like shit a lot of the time. 
---
Family will mean you can't game as much. If you're intent on not having family then go for it, but imo kids are the meaning of life.
---
Lookit Mr. Negative over here. Can't have nice things, huh?
---
Is molten core easier than wotlk naxx? I started raiding during tbc and that naxx was the most dissapoinitngly easy raid I ever did (not counting tol barad, because that was a PvP raid).
---
Right. That's why I think it will be done. First off I think you're going to see the world record shattered during classic. Second I think you'll have the top guilds sharing accounts to level 24/7.
---
The big hiccup will come in server stability or other things out of the players' control. If there is a significant amount of down time in the first week (which anyone who has been through a blizzard launch can tell you is a very real possibility) then it's going to be harder.
---
I appreciate your point of view, this is honestly the main reason I'm considering night elf as I do prefer them as a race overall. However I am also interested in maximizing performance as well, and racials in vanilla can be pretty impactful.
---
A few are doable but invites guild drama like nothing else.  Guarantee you in any raid at least 50% of your druids/priests/shamans/paladins wish they could be not healing.
---
Letting only one of them meme it up is fine for dps, but terrible for group cohesion: why does he get to meme spec and I dont?  I guarantee you if your answer is that the player is fun and shows up on time, you're going to further piss off the rest of the people who don't meme.
---
Then you have the issue of loot.  Your memer potentially takes loot that your other DPS classes could use, and at best takes loot that your healers would like for PvP based on their "priority."  
---
All so one memer gets special treatment and are allowed to come without making the same sacrifices that all the other players of that class or role have to make.  People generally don't like special treatment.
---
Yeah actually I do, but whatever you say.
---
I'm torn on this.
---
Everybody has their pet peeves with Vanilla. Once you start changing stuff, I fear we're going straight back to BfA. The majority of players are fucking idiots that don't know what they want or how certain changes will affect the game long term. Hell, I'm 100% sure  I asked for one of the other things that - looking back - were utterly retarded.
---
If it were for me, I'd toss the R14 system (what an awful, awful, awful system) first. But once you start changing stuff, the doors are open for suggestions and then the shitters will come out of the woodworks and demand the dumbest stuff, pointing at the change of the PvP system as a precedence.
---
A part of me wants them to work on unviable specs. On Druids and Paladins becoming (truly) viable tanks. A good PvP system that rewards skill over time invested (while keeping the prestige of 1-2 R14 per week)...
---
Another part of me is just scared of YOUR list, if you know what I mean.
---
As an EU player, it’s odd how I have the opposite view! 
---
And unlucky, while it’s only ‘America’s and Oceanic’ accounts in this test, that doesn’t mean the players are limited to those regions :)
---
Why do people want to play shaman so much?  Shaman suck ass.
---
They said that 1.12 was the only copy they could find.
---
hilarious.
---
The way you got legendaries sucked but the complexity they added to your class was great
---
Sorry, but do we really need more of these threads? There are hundreds and hundreds of them. "play to have fun, don't care what people think" is the most common opinion there is. Please.

Not mobile at all?!? It’s easily the second most mobile class after Druids. The reason hunter is so good in PvP is kiting. They outrange everyone. You won’t get dazed if they can’t hit you.
---
I plan on doing a bunch of meal prep the weekend before. Stuff for burritos. Sautéed Onions/peppers, refried beans, fajita meat, cojita cheese. Pretty well all of that will be fine in the fridge for the week I took off to play. 
---
So when I’m hungry. Wrap up a rito and get back to grinding.   
---
Going to get some other heat and eat stuff like pizza rolls and taquitos. 
---
For drinks coffee by the pot, no sugar Monsters and red diamond tea.
---
Orcs are so money baby, so money.
---
Spending multiple hours a day doing a task that earns money, legally, is a real job. Don't be mad that you hate your job and are envious of them.
---
I keep getting adverts about Destiny Child, have no idea what it is about but it looks terrible. Any game that advertises with youtube ads is probably terrible.
---
I get league of legends ads all the time. They are hilarious. But its installed on my pc alrdy so idk what they want to achieve.
---
Who hurt you?
---
And all that is ruined by click to move :(
---
I agree that some horde racials are insane, but you shouldn’t have to worry too much. The best thing you can do in your situation is run Engineering, lots of great utility that rogues benefit from.
---
I’m interested to see your speedleveling progress
---
As a long-time holy paladin, I can confirm. I was wearing a mix of pieces as raid gear. Stats are stats and we had no penalty to not wearing plate back then.
---
It’s a cosmetic item, no one deserves it more than anyone else or will benefit from it any more than others.
---
Not sure which mobs in winterspring that would be but I saw someone on a stream pulling those undead on the frozen lake to the guards in everlook.
---
Yeah but you need 5 ranks of your spells on your bars
---
"Nope" as in it does not do as much as Corruption or "Nope" as in some other reason?
---
Nobody is factoring in any teething problems with the servers, the over population, layering, sharding, mob spawns or anything else like that.
---
I think week 1 Rags kill will be really hard. Impressive if anyone can pull it off though.
---
Rogues and warlocks often don't even go undead yes, and if you lose to a mage you should reroll.
---
People can agree and comment without upvoting a thread. It's also probably being downvoted because it's the most repeated and annoying thread there is.
---
He's not getting enough dick poking at his hole it seems.
---
Thanks for at least posting something of substance instead of qq'ing, while I agree with the loot drop buffs, instance buffs etc the **late/****end game** will be easier. The OP however is purely a very early game perspective. He played over 3 days on a friends beta account, he probably made it to around level 15-20 at best and now wants to rant about how easy it all is without any actual facts. The problem he is not really contributing anything productive and just making noise.
---
If you farm the rep before hand and go to Azshara 3 times during the raid you can get quintessence first week
---
How often you survive with 5% health though
---
Big whoosh. The point is that while SoC will be a "wasted" dispel, it's not going to be the only effect that's dispelled. It has a lower damage judgment as well.
---
&gt; 1 GCD
---
Nobody said this. Clearly SS and ES will be follow ups to purge. Pretty sure SoC is on GCD too. So you'll what, cast SoC on the same cast as SS? Grats, you still got chunked. Next GCD with be ES, so you got chunked again.
---
This will be my first time playing Classic, excluding a stress test from a while ago. I want to have a fun and easy leveling experience, not necessarily fast, but something that isn’t too demanding to play. I also want to feel like I bring something to the team when I do group content (primarily dungeons and battlegrounds, with a little of world pvp thrown in).
---
So far, I’ve considered:
---
Prot Warrior (I like tanking in retail, I think I’d like to try it in classic)
---
Mage (it’ll definitely play into the usefulness aspect I’m looking for)
---
Ret Pally (because I played the first 10 levels in a stress test, was actually kinda fun)
---
Hunter (people have said its fast and easy to level)
---
Rogue (because utility, dps, and the like)
---
Enhance Shaman (I’ve heard shamans are fun, never said I was looking to be viable)
---
I’ll probably play Alliance in an RPPVP server, but again, I’ve considered shaman. What do you guys suggest?
---
I think the solution is definitely the toughest part, and mainly lies on the responsibility of the streamer (stream with a delay, deal with it, run with a group, recruit help from others, etc). However, I do think _some_ behavior will require GM intervention just like any other person would. Multi-day or hours and hours of being camped shouldn't be a reasonable expectation for anyone to have to endure. Its definitely a tricky situation!
---
Like reading a headline and not the actual article
---
There is a difference in debuff priority?
---
Ignite
---
I'm getting a strong déjà vu feeling... this is the forced PL argument we've had at BFA launch all over again.
---
summary : no one that successfully raided mythic for some time couldn't be bothered to go back to DKP and all the hassle it brings. The quantity of loot doesn't matter.
---
I don't know. When I was in college (I guess this is the right translation), I had to go to class 6 days a week, + lots of traveling and having to study whenever I was home.
---
I once had a 58 hours per week job and I had more free time than when I was in college.
---
It's gonna come down to YOUR skill, not your faction. End of story.
---
fair enough, it's a difficult build to make, one that works in pvp and pve. I have some experience raiding as this spec and it was fine for my guild.

What are you talking about? Crossrealm battlegrounds exist so players can get queues faster and farm honor faster so they can buy rewards. It is no different than Dungeon and Raid finder. You queue faster and play with random players from other servers.
---
b-b-b-b-but then I can't interact with my chat accurately!
---
Warrior will do more dps as nightfall bitch though.

If you’re not sure, then you’re in the stress test.

&gt;As soon as you get to Razor Hill, set hearth, run to Org and get LW/Skinning, hearth, and simply continue on your path to level 10 using Joana's Guide.  
---
&gt;Make 19 Light Leather to get to 20 LW. If you have more Ruined Leather Scraps, use them now for extra skillups. Make Light Armor Kits to level 40.  
---
&gt;Once you get to level 10 and head to Org to turn in Skull Rock, etc, youll have enough leather to craft 5-7 Embossed Leather Vest which you will train now. Drop LW and DE them all, should be enough to get to 10 Ench while having enough mats for a Lesser Magic Wand when you get there (create Rune Copper Rod before level 5!).  
---
&gt;If you're REALLY in dire straits, you can sell anything you have because the enchanting vendor sells a Lesser Magic Essence for 8s (you should have almost exactly that by now)

How do people even use the Internet without an AdBlocker?
---
A couple years after I started using one (**YEARS** ago) I reinstalled my system and thought to myself
---
&gt;You know what, GenitalJouser? Maybe give the Internet another shot. After all many pages are reliant on the ad revenue and they provide you great and 'free' services. It can't be THAT bad, right?
---
HUGE ASS ANIMATED BANNERS EVERYWHERE. With ads being so fucking intrusive, these fucking morons should be happy that there are still so many people who don't know about AdBlockers, rather than whining about the handful of people that use them. Fucking greedy shits.
---
How about you make the ads classy, plain and non-intrusive? And ideally not overloaded with malware. From chosen partners that sell products that are not a total scam.
---
No? Then fuck you.
---
To recreate classic authenticity they are gonna make you wait until sometime after launch for them
---
Well, you are playing moonkin on classic so...
---
Would it be wise NOT to level as Engi though? It's a gold sink that doesn't help a ton with leveling as far as I know, and the mats to build stuff will be more expensive early in the game. Wouldn't it be better to go something like Skinning in which practically levels itself and gets you some coin then dropping it later at 60 when you need Engi?
---
Oh! This is a good idea!
---
For life to happen you need to work, there's no going around it imo, unless your born rich. 
---
And yes there's more to life than just doing fun things. We are built towards progression in life, getting a house, kids etc. Don't substitute that with progression in games. 
---
Unless you're not interested in family or bettering your living situation etc, then just keep going. But I think most people will regret not moving forward.
---
Came here looking for this
---
I had to do this exact same thing. Always thought it must have been funny for other players to see my braindead character just sitting there as the zeppelin went back and forth.
---
What do you mean PvP doesn't matter? Some of the best rewards come from PvP. Many players gear through PvP.
---
I work at a mobile gaming company so I might be able to find a way 🤔
---
Why would you waste your time with games in general?
---
Would tokens really be a bad thing?
---
People are going to buy wow classic gold for real money. That is a fact. No matter how much you don't want it, people will do it.
---
Knowing that, wouldn't it be nice to also be able to pay for your wow subscription by farming gold on classic instead of having to do it on retail?
---
Man how I miss the TBC and WoTLK.
---
For me, my perception of legion is different because I resubbed to wow after 8 years without playing,  3 months before legion ended.   I liked the end of legion up until a couple weeks before BFA when nobody cared anymore. 
---
Things I liked:
---
* Vendor for legendary items meant you could pick how you wanted to play. 
---
* Lots of non- combat fun to be had,  including mounts and fishing quests. 
---
* artifact power was easy to obtain and max out your abilities on your artifact weapons. 
---
* Artifact and legendary abilities varied and synergized with talents on a higher level than BFA.  You did better by playing smarter.
---
* class halls made you feel like you were the class you played.   Playing a new character meant a completely different experience as long as you're a different class. 
---
* mission table felt rewarding.  Dailies rewarded a nice chunk of gold.   Gold didn't feel like it was scarce.
---
Flying was available and really changed how you played.   I could do dailies with impunity. 
---
Things that legion didn't start with that I just praised:
---
* the legendary vendor was not until the last 2 months of legion. Before that time you could not work towards obtaining legendaries and had to just hope for one to randomly drop for you. 
---
* artifact power was apparently time gated at one time.  When artifact weapons were released they were terrible to level. 
---
Things that I disliked:
---
* allied race unlocks time gated behind rep you couldn't grind unless daily quests were available.  Seriously eff that.
---
* once you unlock an allies race, be prepared to level again.  Because paid level boosts create an incentive for blizzard to keep leveling boring and unappealing,  there's an active conflict of interest with the community who just want their allied race character.
---
* lots of rng in the loot vendors.   I didn't hate the argus vendor, but I didn't like the chance that the gear I got would suck.  Lots of wasted time as it were.
---
* flying was timegated by a reputation wall you could not control because it was also based on available daily quests.
---
All in all, I think that most people who really liked legion are just remembering the last few months when argus and decent loot vendors were released and fixed the gearing problems for people.
---
Sounds like your expecting combat to be too short and have no idea how to fight a longer fight. Rogues are lethal in vanilla and can beat anyone. I'd be reevaluating how you control the fight.
---
Well we are all just working so that one day we can retire and play WoW. So I mean what’s the point really?
---
What class has the lowest skill floor for group PVP? Looking to just play casually but still have a enjoyable time in group PVP without top tier raiding gear or high skill acquired from lots of playing?
---
This doesn't necessarily exclude classes that have a high skill cap, just looking for a class with a low baseline where I can still have fun in battlegrounds with basic gear.
---
I was thinking between a mage and a rogue (which I played in Classic/TBC).
---
I'm not subbed but I have the option to download the beta, does that mean I'm in?
---
Because you would get more dps as having a priest spec shadow (shadow weaving + their dps) or more dps/utility with a feral who can also offtank.
---
Just use uBlock origin buds
---
Track hidden won't do you much good. Track humanoid is actually really insane because you will see the rogue before they even know you are there. 100% there will be some addon to click target the people marked on your minimap, and you can put hunter's mark on the rogues. Hunter mark continues to work even when the rogue is stealthed, so they are left to vanish or they are 100% fucked.
---
Also your pet **should**(idk if anyone tested) follow rogues in steath if you send the pet in before the rogue stealthed. Vanish again breaks this. 
---
Engineering is ofc amazing. A good'ol netomatic with a flare on top so they can't vanish will actually make rogues reroll. https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10720 be aware this item fucks up a lot.
---
Tauren has extra attack range.  Combine that with the melee-leeway that appears to be in Classic and you have stupid range.  You can hamstring enemies nowhere near you.  Sweeping strikes will hit enemies from so far away you didn't even realize they were there.  Then you have that same crazy range with an aoe stun, which is another good interrupt.
---
Good! If you are experienced with the paladin class, and know how to play them well, they are sooooo good in classic. People are going to love you!
---
As long as you don't suck and aren't an asshole, idc what you play so long as we have a comp that can finish (tank and healer would be nice)
---
Play around hardiness. If you know you can kill the orc using either garrote, ambush, or cheap shot why would you choose the one that has a 30% chance to fail. Same with kidney vs other finishers
---
maybe

The only direction they’re going to be running is in circles, or you can just put them to sleep

&gt; Vader is a commander who is scary because of what he knows and believes
---
I'd disagree, that you've got a part of it, but not the whole thing.
---
He's a good villain, not just because of his knowledge and belief, but also due to where he is, and is not, competent.
---
Vader is an excellent field commander, competent in small squad tactics, and nearly unkillable in a straight fight, but who doesn't have the loyalty of his men, and so must resort to direct acts of violence against anyone who wrongs him, to keep things running the way he wants solely on fear.
---
Vader is, in that respect, a near personification of the Empire. No loyalty, order through fear. Overwhelmingly powerful in a straight fight, needing to be beaten by alternative means. A force that crushes its enemies with no mercy.
---
Crossrealm BGs were added 4 to 5 months before TBC was released. Most of Classic sis not have them. Crossrealm Batlegrounds in 1.12 are virtually the same system as Dungeon Finder and Raid Finder. Or am I missing something?
---
Actually he stocks 2.
---
And yet, a lot of the time, any other race/class/spec combo will be able to defeat you (not saying you're a bad player at all). I'm just saying that you can never really "be the best".
---
That said, as a night elf warrior, the extra dodge chance will be super nice when tanking and when PVPing other melee classes (as long as it's not another warrior, then he will simply have way more Overpower procs on you which is insta deth).
---
Personally, in Vanilla I rolled a Tauren because of a PvP video. This time I'm rolling an Undead because not only do I like it the most, but they also have underwater breathing which can be BiS in a lot of cases, and also anti-fear for PvP/PvE scenarios and Cannibalize which is  amazing for uptime and faster health regen when leveling.
---
So, actually, I believe the Undead is the most versatile and a great option for a warrior class!
---
Just don’t join the famous streamer server and don’t think about the issues regarding streamers.
---
Those who want to suck their dicks can do that, you won’t interact with them.
---
This would take the place of Winters chill if you’re  in AQ or Naxx as Fire mage
---
Whats wrong with Disc priest? Great heals and power infusion is huge for putting on a DPS or myself if I'm having trouble keeping up.
---
Calm down there. You are comparing pvp and pve.
---
In pvp, if horde always always wins bg's on the server, alliance stops doing bg's and they eventually leave the server. Cross realm prevents this obvious burnout and imbalance, preventing total domination of bg's, preventing servers from being abandoned. 
---
In dungeons and raids, you are up against the same ai, over and over and over, making it predictable and much more about learning to move from this and heal that at this time. You don't have the same balance issue, the ai is never not there, you face the exact same thing again and again and again. It's a whole other beast.
---
The travel to and from dungeon/raids and the setup time, is what creates a community on a server, because you are forced to work together. This is what people want, what they miss and this exact tool (lfg and lfr) is often blamed for ruining this exact feeling in the game. 
---
But in bg's you don't need the same amount of setup time and to win, encouring less collaboration, but still rewarding a server community for pre-mades. However, if one side crushes the other side out of existence, either by just being better or being more, the pvp server dies and people leave it. Which is bad for everyone.
---
Roll PVE server.  Problem solved.
---
Looking at their other posts on this sub it appears we may be getting trolled. I don't think someone could always be that upset with things that don't affect them.
---
I wonder how blacklisting is going to be handled.
---
Back then not every server had a place outside of the game to communicate. Nowadays there'll probably be a semi-official forum for each. Not looking forward to witchhunts.

There's some guy that usually posts on all these type of threads about having over a hundred people organized to get a world first rag kill. The plan seems to involve rotating players on accounts to level/prep 24 hours a day and having a lot of support people for summons and whatever else.
---
If that's true then they'll probably get a week one kill, but even with that much preparation they're still ultimately at the mercy of server stability. If the launch goes smoothly I could see it happening.
---
Whatever you have to tell yourself to get through the day.
---
So close, yet so far
---
New life breathed into old art

Wipe because enrager time? ok, low dps should be changed. Wipe because avoidable damage? Then the problem is the people that don't play around the mechanics. It can be avoided by having more dps and carrying people who tunnelvision, but if you change the low dps because they do low dps, you should change the people who die to things they could avoid
---
I prefer loot council, it's the best gearing system for the raid.
---
&gt; If you're lucky enough to get paid for streaming in real life, maybe choose one (or choose an avenue within one) that doesn't give the general public the opportunity to exploit it. Seeing someone streaming themselves shopping is as if to say "I know you know where I am, I dare you to do someone about it". Any grievance caused by this is completely warranted, and any notion of penalizing people for taking advantage of this is mindbogglingly idiotic. The onus is not on the public to uphold consideration, its either on the streamers to be prepared for the attention they're spotlighting on themselves, or on the streamers to explore areas of the world not impacted by the possible presence of others.
---
&gt; Streamers in general seem to think the world revolves around them, but the opposite of that is the cold hard truth. They're lucky to have this world to revolve around.
---
Thanks OP, you've convinced me to start yelling expletives at RL streamers.
---
Tool, Radiohead, and Beck and then we’re talking
---
WoD under appreciated lmaooooo ok dude
---
I did this during orginal vanilla. I dont think I would ever do it again. I saved up my pay for about 6 months and quit and lived off of it for over a year. I would not reccomend doing it but if you do make sure to save up to pay all bills, food, and whatever else for a full year.
---
I would go Orc, I think they look badass and the stun resist is just too good in pvp.  
---
Blood Fury is a neat DPS racial aswell, as long as you know when to use it.
---
Well yes, but actually no. 
---
Unless you’re both 14 you should both be mature enough to handle it.
---
That's what it looks like to me, but no one knows for sure.
---
Right so streamers aren't allowed to play the games they enjoy because people can't help but to look them up on the second screen?
---
You sound like the kind of kid that cheated in split screen games.
---
The Darth Maul thing was supposed to tie into the Clone Wars cartoon where Maul is a huge deal for a season or two. He was pretty awesome there, far better than in Ep1 where he basically said nadda and was hardly even a character.
---
The other problem with Solo for me was it felt the need to explain every little god damn thing about Han. Where he met Chewie? Okay fine. Why he has that gun and why he flips it around? Okay that's getting a bit oddly specific. Why he has the dice in the Falcon? Okay now it's getting a bit silly.
---
It's a minor thing but it felt more like I was watching a movie adaptation of one of those scholastic visual guide books than a movie after a point.
---
&gt;Loot council is great for 20 man's but has no place in 40 man raids when you only get 2-4 pieces of loot off a boss. Top performers get away with not showing up to raids, get away with murder or end up destroying your guild by quitting.
---
Honestly this is just a problem with the culture of a guild, not the system. DKP is a high floor low ceiling system for guilds that have drama and low guild loyalty. 
---
Loot council is by far the best and most efficient system when you have genuinely good ppl as class leads, and a real community instead of just a group of ppl who raid.
---
Or take a zeppelin to Org.
---
Just do what you want and see if he caves. Tell the pve ret pally to go play hello kitty island adventures
---
Paladin support is better in PVP. Windfury doesn’t have shit on cleanse and freedom.
---
wait figured it out. I'm dumb
---
Yeah, definitely different strokes for different folks. I wasn't saying DI is engaging, just that some people might have more fun with the more utility spells.
---
Ultimately I was just trying to say that rotations in this game will feel bad as it's way slower. You might have more options as a Priest, sure, but the fights will be really simple and not as engaged as Retail is. Ultimately it becomes: Do I AoE or Single Target heal? Not like in Retail where you have more positioning effects, damage reduction, placable aoe, etc. 
---
But yeah, both classes are absolutely fine and people are engaged by different aspects
---
$6000?! Shit, I put my investments in the wrong place.
---
I like this. Plus bigger thunderfury = bigger everything.
---
Don’t say “streamers think the game revolves around them” and then keep making post about streamers.
---
you have stress test, not beta
---
It's for the stress test, everyone was invited with an active account.
---
While I don't disagree with anything said here, we're beating a dead horse.  Blizz has already spoken on the matter and the onus is on the streamer to incorporate safeguards (stream delay, etc).  Nobody is going to be punished for targeting streamers.
---
So, for the purposes of education (lol!)  This would then work correct?

Which is the correct order =)
---
you didn't address a single thing I wrote to you. 
---
cross realm bgs don't exist to shorten queues and allow for faster honor farm. while blizzard is fully aware that shorter queues and greater access to honor play into their goal of exploiting instant gratification, it's not the reason they did it in the first place. before cross realm bgs was a thing you had servers which had one-sided metas between the factions which ended up discouraging one side from playing entirely. that resulted in neither side being able to play thus the long queue times. you probably don't know this because I'm gonna go ahead and assume you didn't even play vanilla wow.   
---
you're not actually making any arguments here
---
And then they'll continue to wipe to people not doing simple-ass mechanics
---
Try making half brown linen robes and half white linen robes. I always seemed to get at least one of each with that method.

Was panda wow actually every liked?
---
You can even afford it with ~15 people below 60, assuming they play well (which they certainly do if they manage to get 55+ during week 1)

Seriously, i completely forgot about a lot of ads online. The other day my friend asked me if I’ve been getting twitch ads and it took me almost a minute to figure out what he meant, I 100% forgot streamers ran ads on twitch
---
All dark iron residue n stuffs to one blacksmith who makes FR gear for the warrior tank and use a Druid to off on Raggy with volcanic.
---
Tanking is doable without much work tbh.
---
Dps is about hit gear, dm tribe is easy to farm and so is UBRS, which supplies enough with tarnished elven rings, shoulder and perhaps rend swords.
---
Dps is doable.
---
Healing can be done with enough consumes and decent gear. Doable.
---
Caster dps would be my worry, but you can just stack rogues
---
you can still get thunderfury and maintank as orc. 
---
Tauren is op there ofc.

For me vanilla and tbc were trance filled.

I am having a really tough time deciding between Shaman / Rogue. I was set on shammy for months and months but watching ooga gang / payo has me thinking  
---
\-I loved healing in Wrath on my pally in raids but hated it in PvP
---
\-Plan on playing on a PvP server and taking hours at a time while leveling to gank  
---
\-truth be told, im that dick and love the idea of stealthing around ganking lowbies time after time after time... ooops  
---
\-Melee is prefed form of combat. love the simplicty / spamming / stunlock of rogues
---
\-WF.... may be 1/15 kills but damn does it feel good
---
help
---
also stealthing and ambushing someone as they kill a mob seems awesome, so does sapping opposing faction going for a chest and stealing it... but so does chain lighting + lightning bolt + shock crits
---
Then either you're asking the wrong questions or that GM doesn't know what they're talking about: https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=520
---
Yup, this is how my guild ran it. DKP with loot council for Main Tank and a few Main Heals/ legendary items too.
---
I've already decided my main will be a warrior but I am more than likely going to need a farm alt to keep up with the gold costs of constant respeccing and raid repairs on platemail. I cant decide if I would be better off with hunter, priest, or warlock as they all have good farm potential and none of them are that difficult to level. What would yall recommend?
---
You're totally right. And it feels like part of the X-realm BGs were to introduce the concepts of Battlegrounds and cross-server combat in anticipation for TBC Arenas.
---
It does my heart good to see the map from before the abortion that was cataclysm.

My entire life, I've stayed indoors, I haven't smoked, I've avoided living in high traffic areas and this was all for nothing, because this post gave me cancer.

Streamers don't think the game revolves around them, but if you think them streaming themselves farming is done as any sort of message to other players, apparently *YOU* are the one who believes it does.
---
Also, for the record, I don't think there's anything more entitled than spoiling the enjoyment of hundreds (or thousands) of other people for your own benefit.
---
\*everyone from the US, eu scrubs stay out.
---
Thats a good point. You can always trash talk the other tanks though for having less hp.
---
Thank you I've been having the same issue
---
Shouldn’t they get banned for that?
---
By chance did you play on US-Dethecus or US-Magtheridon (cant remember which, I played both realms)in Vanilla? If so I think we raised together for quite a while.
---
True, I was thinking going herb/skinning then dropping skinning for alchemy at 60, but since I'm no longer going alchemy on my main, this would make sense again.
---
Why would I push him to a superior game? I dont want him to stop playing all together.
---
A major selling point of Classic is the community, socializing, and teamwork required. 
---
The whole concept of the Classic is to work together as a faction to succeed in PvE amd PvP. Your Honor Ranking exists separate from the enemy faction. The original Battleground system required players to travel through the zones and meet at the entrance of the battleground. The same applies for dungeons and raids in Classic. Forming dungeon and raid groups on your own server is part of the experience.
---
I would try for the thresher eyes if it is practical. You only need 3, and the thresher eyes are a lot of money. You get 10 silver for the quest, which is a lot at level 12.
---
Really, it depends on your route. If you are running a route where you are much overleveled, I would not do it due to bad exp in the area. But if you can justify actually going around the zone killing stuff? I would say that it makes a lot of sense. Hell, if you are melee and deliberately avoiding the rabid bears, it can be impractical NOT to kill a bunch of the moonstalker runts, just to clear up space to walk through without aggroing the hated rabies bears.
---
They have a renewed charm because of /r/PrequelMemes but by and large they are not good movies (at least in my opinion.) They really highlight how wooden Lucas's writing is, and how limited his ability in directed had become.
---
At least the TCG items are aesthetic only - pets, tabards, and toys. I don't think that would be the end of the world to include, but I'm satisfied either way.
---
You mean I could raid and watch something at the same time?
---
yeah that may help a bit, but my ocd usually wont let me to only listen to something for long
---
Miami Tyreal isn't from Diablo 3 - it is from a promotional event in 2008 - with that said it still won't be in regardless.
---
Killed it.
---
When you know your path and have done it multiple times through, there will be congestion with the zero. Knowing your route takes you ahead of the pack thus no congestion. obviously not if you play 2 hours but if you play 12 hours straight and know what you're doing you won't have congestion because you'll be ahead of most if not all of the zerg
---
as punishment you have to farm 100 boar intestines once classic finally hits in august...
---
Big in halo montages lol
---
I guess I could make a macro to diss orcs hp pool every time I get stunned.
---
With 5 Nightslayer you want Vigor: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305300105041351-320302102-0502. 
---
But don't rely on Improved Sprint so much. It has limited utility and will only save you during roots, which you can just Vanish from.
---
These have always been my two favorite PVP specs:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/30530310501135-3203-05023003
---
I like this one because I don't need to respec for raids unless we're speedrunning (once a month).
---

---
This I use in BG premades.
---
Backstab does decent damage, but it's main benefit is combo points. Ideally you're at 4 combo points within 3 seconds.
---
If they come to our server I wish them good luck, we’ll be sitting on their arses with 20+ people just for fun. 
---
With hunters ready at the spirit healers, rogues at orgrimmar GY idaf.
---
Bitches are going down
---
Wouldn't be surprised if some of the larger servers with bug guilds just had a discord with server peeps in it
---
Solo - Mage/Hunter.  Hunters are harder to learn with more upkeep (pet/ammo), but still fun and can contribute without having to master them.  Both are even more fun when mastered.  
---
Duo - Holy Paladin / Resto Shaman depending on faction.  Playing/Leveling with a buddy is awesome and its a natural progression from learning to heal your buddy to healing the rest of the BG.  Healers are needed, so even when you aren't the best geared or highest skill cap, you are often still welcome.  Buddy can learn to peel for you, and you then have the biggest impact possible on a BG with a low skill cap.
---
That was to the guy that said no congestion sarcastically woops
---
I think it's all right; you can farm cloth to make greens to DE for mats, either by running five mans or by solo farming mobs out in the world. It's not a walk in the park by any means, but I don't really think any professions are. :P
---
I'll echo herb/skin since you can't track more than one node on the map at a time. Mining/skinning is an option too, of course.
---
im glad you came to terms with that lol
---
It's not as big a deal as it was back in the day. I remember people making a huge deal about loot drops. If you really have a problem, then I suggest you find a guild with people you can trust and run with them as much as possible.
---
All of those times are in 3 hours, except for est. 4pm EST from right now is 2 hours. Am I having a stroke?
---
You can tank 5 man's without a single point in prot
---
Make sure to taunt them for not having a racial stun too
---
Dude, they did cross server BGs because same server BGs sucked.
---
I remember on my server (very high population, long login queues every single day) there were, on an average evening, around 3-5 WSG+Arathi (combined) open. And usually half of these were completely dominated by premade groups. And there was always one that had way too few players. And waiting times were horrible because Alliance:Horde ratio was super imbalanced. Alliance players would wait an entire evening just for one BG just to get matched up against a premade. 
---
It was complete shit.
---
There's a huge social aspect to PvPing well with players on your own server, since that's where a *ton* of player reputation and forum flamewars started. And playing against people you sorta know and recognize is another community aspect that's central to Vanilla's game design.
---
&gt; and x-server BGs was in vanilla long before tBC was released.
---
It was added like 3 months before the prepatch. Same-realm BGs were in the game 14 months, in comparison.
---
How are MoP and Cata rated as badly as WoD?
---
This makes it hard to take these ratings serious. WoD was the second worst expansion by far. And objectively speaking, MoP wasn't all that terrible (even though I hated the dumb-ass humor and wasn't too fond of the theme) and early Cata was some of the best content this game got expansion wise (though I cannot say how much that changed after the heroic dungeon nerfs, as I left then)
---
rogue one isn't a main entry, like Solo.
---
i dont think most people grew to hate legion there def were some issues with legendaria and stuff but id say overall it was a fun expansion
---
idk never played classic but you should be able to at lv 60
---
I would definitely pick a hunter, or a mage or paladin. Mages can charge for ports, can AoE dungeons same w paladin, and hunters can solo a lot with their pets, you could do a warlock too, they have pets, AoE and a free mount.
---
Rank 14 grinder, toilet, bed and main hand
---
perception is really good against rogues.
---
I am having trouble deciding between a Warlock and Shaman (most likely elemental or resto).  I originally started playing WoW during BC, but most of my playtime was between Cataclysm-Pandaria.  I have dabbled with warriors but didn't make it to max level, and played a good amount of priest,hunter and druid.  I want to try a new class, and figure shaman/warlock could be fun. I am going to be playing with a buddy of mine through the leveling process, who is more than likely going to be playing a mage.  Would a shaman or warlock complement a mage better?  We will do some 5-mans, pvp (definitely going to play on a pvp server), and maybe a bit of end game raiding, but more than likely we will play fairly casually.  I have never played either class before, and would love folks' input about which is more fun and would pair well with a mage.   Thanks in advance for feedback!
---
That 5% hp lets you gear for more damage or other defensive stats in non-glass cannon roles.
---
It's a rather good racial overall.
---
It'll be there once AV launches (Phase 3 IIRC)
---
what extra attack range? sauce?
---
Uhm why would they remove it?

Just make the trip out and grab the flight paths on your way hearth back and train and go back if needed it'll take 10-15 mins.
---
Wow... hilarious! Great read, 10/10. Sick LOTR memes. And yeah, I saw you guys on the list of 119 guilds who cleared Naxx representing Shattered Hand! Was such a sick server before the transfers :\.
---
I'm gonna have to reshare this with some old friends like Tigerlady.
---
„Play now for free”
---
Id say hunter for lowest skill floor, or mage. Definitely not rogue.
---
Not arguing pro or contra xrealm.
---
But are you honestly arguing that queues are a good thing so people go out into the world instead of playing the game mode they want to play? Seriously? This hurts just to think about it. If the world was interesting enough for people to visit instead of playing BGs they'd do so, but obviously that's not their focus. That's a perfect example of "I know better how the game is supposed to be played". What the hell.
---
This guy. For everyone who is new vanilla...listen to this guy!
---
Will the item Unstoppable force be in Classic? Is that what you're asking? Or am I missing something haha. Yes it will of course be in Classic, once the Battle Ground Phase drops.
---
i have in plenty of 1v1 pvp
---
I know you can when leveling, can you for the end game five man's?
---
Sure but if you're talking soloing a dungeon like WC, I'd think any class could do it at 60.
---
Since aesthetics is key for you, which do you enjoy most, Orc or Tauren?
---
Leveling was honestly such a jarring and horrible experience in that time period. The new early level progression was cool, but just so vastly different from before and so easy/fast if you were trying to level quickly. Then you hit 60 and are thrown back into 4-year-old content that really hadn't aged well at all.
---
On my 4th or 5th alt I could still find new/fun ways to do those early levels, but many a toon was left forgotten in the 60-70 range. Outlands was just NOT a good time at that point.
---
Spectral Tiger did not come out with the original Vanilla TCG cards. On top of that even if it did you would effectively be spending $3000 to save ~1200g which is absurd considering gold sellers will 100% be a thing in Classic (just as they are on Live and just as they were in Vanilla).
---
It's definitely worth some amount of DPS, but only if you spend mana to powershift. If you powershift more than once or twice in a row, then you don't have enough mana to heal, Innervate or Rebirth + go back into cat form afterwards. And those utility spells are the main selling points of bringing a DPS Druid in the first place.
---
I think it's better to give it a value of 0 and let people decide for themselves when they might make use of it. On progression fights, Druids are better off with a helm that has stats.
---
oh god, GG!
---
5% of the time!
---
this made me laugh
---
Fair enough. I like undead as casters or rogues, but I don't really think they look good in plate at all so not really considering that :/
---
&gt;But can you get 40 people to do that consolidated into one server? Then you have to get BIS farms and attunement. I can’t see it. It doesn’t make sense to me to down it in week 1.
---
Private server guilds that stick together from a pserver. That's how.
---
Also don't get too caught up in the "leveling record", even the record holder admits there  are many mistakes and is certain he will beat it by several hours if not half a day. 
---
Lastly, MC does not require that amazing gear. The hardest part is to have a good FR geared tank, but you can gear up REALLY fast with a full 5-10 man premade spamming dungeons until you have the pieces you need.
---
It should but just to reiterate, you should not do this, it will make you a worse player and you end up in shitty situations such as putting on your two-hander while tanking, just to avoid a button press.
---
My favorite weapon
---
But wow isn’t an esport it’s an RPG. If you want to be competitive go play Overwatch. 
---
Back to m15 or 20, you basically get the same gear as m10 so once again, other than telling people how cool you are for being able to do it, you don’t have a gearing advantage over a casual player. 
---
Honestly the whole game is ass backwards now. But hey as long as it appeals to you that’s all that matters right? You think you so but you don’t
---
Its hard to beat Mage.  They are good in pvp/pve, have the convenience of food/portals, easy and fun to play.
---
Very few downsides.
---
i was a tauren from 2004. going orc to switch it up. might still roll a 2nd warrior as tauren if i want to mt.
---
If youre serious about cat DPS it's important to be realistic about what you'll have to do, that is to say, you will need to farm gnomeregan absolutely religiously every day to have pummelers for every pull, because without them you lose approx 200 dps
---
Lock is a good choice. It'll let you get some solo play in when  you don't have time to do group stuff. They're decent in pvp and pve, and bring some fun things to the table (summoning, healthstones, looking cool). 
---
Resto druid is all right if you like healing, and you'd get groups for sure, but it'll be hard to do things on your own without respeccing more often than you might be able to affording while juggling school and work with the game.
---
We used to use the BG entrances to queue up in Vanilla, even though there were Battlemasters, because it meant more chances for WPvP between games. Like going to gank people outside the AV entrance, or causing trouble in Ashenvale, or finding trouble in Arathi Highlands.
---
It also meant that people were more particular toward which BG they were actually playing, and didn't leave a WSG game because their AB queue popped.
---
This seems like the reasonable response. There are definitely  people of all classes that are able to hit 58+ in time but the question becomes, does your guild have at least 35 people that are able to level fast enough. Personally I think that even without account sharing it’s possible if you A) build a powerhouse roster and B) Consider there has never before been as much hype and motivation to hit 60 on a fresh vanilla server, meaning people are more likely to take time off and hardcore players are more likely to put in maximum effort and push for server firsts
---
&gt; keep making posts about streamers
---
Inferring I've made more then one post about this. That's not the case
---
Yeah 100% depends on what you want to do when picking a faction. Greater Blessings will be in the game from the start though so chances are you'll have it for 15 minutes and get Wisdom which is what you want in PvP anyway. 
---
War Stomp is VERY good though, 100% agree with you on that. If it's between Nelf and Tauren in PvP with no other factors, I'd say Tauren definitely wins. Stomp + 5% health that scales is way better than just 1% dodge and better stealth. 
---
So yeah, not a clear cut choice, just depends on what you want to do. A lot of Alliance benefits are QoL like Wisp/Moonglade Tele being better/Closer to Gnomer/MOTHERFUCKING FRONT FLIPS
---
Maybe not the place, but does the game not release Monday, August 26th for the Americas at 3 PM Pacific or 6 PM EST?
---
No, LFG removes chatting time as people made their way to the dungeon and you get partied with people you've never seen before in your world and will probably never see again so there is less incentive to socialize with them. People seem to shoot down the discussion for a LFD system like the current retail Mythic dungeon/raid system where you still choose who to group with and it doesnt teleport you to dungeon when all it does is remove being spammed by randoms if you want to heal/tank their dungeon. However, they are ok with x-realm BGs that queues them with and against players they dont know. I remember rivalries we had between opposite factions on our server and there would be shit talking on the official forums between them. I remember the time when I was put against R14 players from my server and we flipped out on ventrilo when we realized. Or when a full T3 warrior solo queued onto our WSG team and we all stood around inspecting him before the match started. And x-realm BGs were added in the final big content patch of Vanilla. Hardly "long before tbc was released."
---
I actually tried that on an alt back in \~1.10 days. Didn't take long to figure out it just wasn't going to work for anything "serious" but it did give me a love for the Survival tree.
---
My understanding these days as that some groups may allow a melee hunter in raids as long they use Nightfall and spam wing clip.
---
Finally decided on a warlock!  Now time to choose a race between Undead and Orc.
---
I greatly prefer the aesthetic of undead spell animations, look of cloth gear, etc but understand orc has some amazing PvP racials.  With the large number of undead players on horde, it's likely more alliance will go warrior/rogue than lock/priest making orc stun resist even more valuable.   
---
At the end of the day i'll likely choose undead but definitely something to consider.
---
You roll troll to be killed by trolls?
---
The 3 C trifecta!
---
So fuckking true lol
---
Mages level really fast and they can do the last few levels AoE farming the silithus mobs to get the reputation needed. I think someone did the math that it's basically just 4-6 hours of trash farming to get the rep needed.
---
What did you do?
---
It means "kids who were introduced to the series by these entries feel a nostalgia towards them, but everyone else thinks they suck"
---
Lol @ the cancer comment. You misinterpreted my post though sir. 
---
It's turning into a dumpster fire though, not even going to bother refuting my points
---
I used to think this, but then I realized I didn't know other classes as well as I should.  That put dueling somewhere above watching paint dry and somewhat below cramming for finals with a hangover.
---
Hunter S Thompson approved!
---
If you want to participate in streamer events you are going to have to have characters on the same server as the streamer.
---
"I am a loot whore"  
---
I stopped reading there hunter.
---
I think a lot of players are going to damage their first classic experience by researching too much ahead of time. It's unfortunate in a way.
---
You realize that judging by your post, YOU are the one who is making the game about streamers, not streamers making the game about them... right?
---
I'm choosing human female Pala purely for aesthetics and animations.
---
Rep is nice, I'll be holy and the other racials won't be very helpful.
---
Stone form is an absolutely fantastic racial for PvP and pve.
---
np!
---
What most people do is not always indicative of the maths behind the scenes. 
---
Ie in Eu4 one of the most popular thing to do in a world conquest is to stack a thing called absolutism, but the best players in the world tend to not stack it and go for other routes that in the end offer much larger rewards.
---
figured it out.
---
Dwarf priest fear ward is also quite useful in coordinated premades, I hear
---
I’m so torn, I leveled a hunter in vanilla, a priest in BC and a pally in WotLK. The hunter was fun to pvp in but boring in raids. I LOVED healing in BC, pvp and pve. My pally I was Holy/prot. I loved the gear in prot and enjoyed tanking but I was more of an off tank bc of AOE tanking. When I heard classic is coming the first though was “I can wait to roll my priest again and get back to healing! My favorite thing to do is hang back and keep my team alive while watching the other side get exhausted. 
---
Now the more I’m thinking about it, I’m inching toward warrior to get into tanking more. The only thing stopping me from fully going warrior is pvp and endgame tanking. Should I stick with my gut and go healer? Or try tanking again? How fun is warrior in pvp?
---
More importantly - longer melee reach
---
SW didn't have a single wide-open area.  It was fairly claustrophobic in comparison.
---
What did he figure out?
---
I am aware and have more or less done my research. I did mention "tryhard appropriately" for a reason.
---
the original welfare epic
---
BIS for feral threat.
---
Tauren have bigger hit boxes, and are subject to being hit from farther away, but can also hit others from farther a way (their reach essentially). There was a blue post confirming this a bit ago from Beta but I can't seem to find it at the moment.
---
I'm pretty sure the streamers calling for bans on people greifing them are the ones making the game about streamers. Great unsubstantiated claim though
---
I gave it a try, twice, for 2-3 months at a time. I thought there were some good things, but in almost every single aspect, I prefer the old way of doing it. M+? Cool, but just make the dungeons hard and they don’t need a Diablo system baked in. Legendaries from dailies? Ironically, legendaries were cooler when I didn’t get them, and if I did, it wasn’t an accident. LFR? I’d rather just have one game with casual elements and have the raiding be mostly on the harder side. World bosses? All I did was click a menu and make sure I hit them *once* for a slot machine’s chance at loot.
---
People say that Legion was the best of the new game. It could definitely be true, but I don’t enjoy the modern game, so that sadly doesn’t mean much to me. *I want to enjoy modern WoW* but it’s so far removed from its conception, that i don’t think it can return.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19323
---
Holy Pally is probably easiest healer to be honest. Super survivable, great mana management, great buffs and Oh Shit buttons.
---
Brings back pixelated pvp videos from yesteryear
---
I was more referring to the city itself, as I'd be bound to spend a lot of time there, but Tirisfal Glades is a nice zone. Also, bald for female is a bit off-putting for me personally, not gonna lie
---
Nope, and I'm not surprised people are downvoting me for thinking having totally irrelevant information wasting screen space is stupid.
---
Yes, I'm personally attacking all of you for your poor UI choices, obviously. /s
---
It’s still nostalgic
---
Can someone explain?
---
The only one of the three that I think was underrated in its time was MoP. I genuinely disliked WoD and Cataclysm, aside from a few things here and there.
---
Okay I’m gonna try and answer what I do know, i’m sure someone will correct me if i’m wrong.
---
1) I don’t think cross-realm will be a thing because classic wow and the server identity/community was a huge factor in making it so great. I think backlash would ensue if Blizzard made it a thing.
---
2) I too wanted to play Feral, but from my understanding Ferals don’t scale the best with gear, and being somewhat DoT reliant, and with raid bosses having a max of 16(?) debuff slots, Fetal DoT’s aren’t as crucial as other debuffs.
---
3) Mats like for professions? I think it’s going to be fair game for the most part but highly coveted mats are gonna be farmed hard by the same groups. People have described them as “mafias”.
---
4) Dependa on your intentions with the game.. if you want to be an absolute sweat and want to clear end game as quickly as possible, then yes you want 1-60 strictly about XP. (i hear duoing is effective.
---
5) Dwarf priests have Fear Warden. Good for fights like Onyxia and i’m sure it’s useful in PvP too.
---
Hope this helped - your english isn’t bad BTW :)
---
WoD and MoP have some legendary raids.
---
for me there was a separate classic wow choice and there are servers to choose from on there
---
True, warlock summon chain is possible, I just assume the preferred method would be to take all the vials you need with you into the raid. I'm sure that's a discussion that they've had though.
---
even if they raise it to 50 and people start clearing brd scholo and lbrs. That would significantly damage the "new game" feel.  
---
The more of their content they expose via streamers and ongoing beta, the more it will feel like joining a 3 month old game where everybody already cleared everything before you start playing.
---
Does anyone have experience tanking as a feral Druid (guardian in retail) in vanilla? 
---
I’m going horde and I thought tanking on a non-warrior would be fun and different - I love Druid as a class in general too.
---
How fun will bears be in classic? What do they bring to the table? Any glaring weaknesses?
---
That... Divides almost perfectly into the 3/1/1 comp, but with some demand for tanks.
---
I like it
---
Missed Pat pvp

&gt;They've never said anything about half of phase 1

https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
&gt;If you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. **Layering also will not happen after Phase 1**, the importance of that being that Phase 2 is planned to introduce the World Boss Kazzak, with the Green Dragons being released later on, both of which would make layering a tool to disrupt the flow of World Bosses in Classic.
---
**&lt;Ascendance&gt;**
---
**Region**: Europe
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Server Type**: PvP 
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
**Raid Roster needs:**
---
* Hunter: Closed
---
* Mage: 1 raid spot open and open for extras
---
* Warlock: Raid full, but open for extras
---
* Priest: Raid full, but open for extras
---
* Rogue: 1 raid spot open and open for      extras
---
* Paladin: Raid full, but open for extras
---
* Warrior: Raid full, but open for extras
---
* Druid: Raid full, but open for extras
---
We still accept classes where we are full, but we cannot guarantee you a raid spot unless someone leaves. 
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have      knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location      at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior      towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend      exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid,      but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered      reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions,      bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down      to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to      respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not      expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require      you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the      debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for      example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM)
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---

We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.

MoP had all those hidden treasures, much like WoD, except the latter expansion had more treasures and rarities in each zone. Some items were even account bound, like weapons and the pickaxe from Mists. While levelling, it was fun to have item procs epic from Draenor's quests and treasures. My druid and mage lucked out, getting epic 600 iLvl procs that got me into dungeons and LFR quicker. WoD's first patch was fun, and it was nice to see new and returning players, even if the expansion quickly lost steam.
---
I can't decide which class to play when classic hits
---
I want something:
---
* DPS
---
* easy to gear up (not overplayed)
---
* It should be able to do both PvP and Endgame raiding
---
I'm considering:
---
sPriest - but it seems it's hard to join raids and they're a low priority for loot
---
Mages - but they're likely overplayed
---
Any other ideas?
---
Stop making post about streamers. Stop shining the spotlight on people you want to avoid. You’re blowing them up even more.

You are aware that Activison Blizzard was founded in 2008, right? Every product Blizzard has created since then including all the expansions that had the most players ever subscribed consecutively World of Warcraft were under the Activision Blizzard banner.
---
Unless you are going to try and argue that WoW has been downhill since Burning Crusade, which is an absurd stance to take given that Wrath and Early/Mid Cata were the peak of subscriber numbers, that is a really strange argument to make.
---
People keep acting like the WoW Token is the worst thing ever added to the game. Stop acting like gold buying &amp; selling never happened in Vanilla, BC, Wrath, etc - it did - you can't just whitewash history because it doesn't fit your outrage.
---
I found it very hard to kill most classes without heavy stuns/control. For example, if I open with Garrote vs. an Orc Shaman the damage is too slow and is mitigated by Healing Stream Totem. Meanwhile he can kill me in 2 shocks, so it feels like a race against time. My Ambush crit against Orc Shamans also felt really, really weak - I assume because of their armor. I suppose it's better than failing the stun, though. The problem is if I don't keep him stunned, like I said I'm dead in 2 shocks with is only a few seconds window to kill him.
---
No he's right top left :D
---
Sabaton is my favorite band, but I may grow to hate them if people just use primo victoria all the time.  They've got so many better song than that :&lt;

Warrior is the best DPS, most people surely don't intend to tank.

&gt; but I would say an argument that stream sniping is a form of harassment could be made
---
Then try to sue a stream sniper in court if it's so easy.  :\^)
---
It used to be that way. But the current game is basically just a collection game with a small e sport “mod”.  Even the storyline doesn’t make sense anymore.
---
Layering goes both ways. The people ahead of the curve will likely abuse it, I know I will. I wish they took measures to counteract abuse but as long as they don’t change things, it will be abused. Imagine being the highest level on a high pop server, and you constantly swap layers to get instant respawns.

Theres no reason it wouldnt be.

Can I ask how you end up getting around 60ish linen cloth? Where abouts throughout your route are you getting that much?

I heard it affects flask of Titans as well.  Can someone confirm?

This one will be in classic and it’s the better version
---
Just curious, why?
---
Well, thats awfully nice and sentimental, but you wanted the vanilla experience, I'm afraid your gonna get it. There is a reason these classes weren't often included in raids or groups. I wish it weren't so. I played a druid and strictly was a back up healer for the majority of Vanilla, but at least I could have a spot. Any other spec and I felt useless....because I was.
---
But then again, there is no real learning curve to classic wow, compared to Vanilla. We all know the fights, what works and what doesn't, so there might be room in raids for carries and filler because it probably wont be as much a wipefest as it was back in the day.
---
Thanks for the specs, I'll have to try them. Do you find any energy starvation issues due to missing Dirty Deeds?
---
As long as I can fish in peace at Shadowprey Village with some cold beer and groovy tunes everything should be alright.

Duskwood. Love the vibe of that place plus some great quest chains.

I suppose overall for me it just didn't feel much like a Star Wars movie, it felt like a sci fi bank heist movie that kept smacking me over the head with HEY LOOK AT THIS REFERENCE type stuff. If you took out the fact it was Star Wars it'd have been panned even harder than it already was. It's issue was as you put it, it kept referring to the fact it was Star Wars. (It also felt like three short movies spliced together but now I rant)
---
Fwiw I didn't think it was an actively bad film, just not up to the quality I came to expect from Star Wars. I even like the new trilogy so far, which seems to anger a lot of people. Especially when I point out a lot of the stuff people hate about the new ones was in the original trilogy too.
---
No, streamers cannot both make egregious amounts of money off of a game while complaining people are causing them grief as a result of them broadcasting their location to the world.
---
Farming mobs in Classic is much harder than in retail, hence healers are much slower.  Highly recommend finding a warrior buddy (should be tons) and teaming up for easy leveling and easy group formation (just add 3 dps).  Match made in heaven.
---
Priests are great in raids.
---
&gt;Under appreciated during it's time    
---
&gt;Warlords of draenor    
---
I'm gonna have to stop you right there. I probably put the most effort into any expansion that I ever have into WoD, it was a turd.  A stupid, stupid turd.
---
There's nothing about Classic WoW that makes it less a "collection game" besides there being less to collect. And it has no competitive mode besides speedrunning, which has no reward and very little scene following.
---
Stop trying to make hybrids work. It’s not gonna happen.
---
it sounds like you're more raid focused than competitive pvp foused, so i want to say warlock - not as common a class so may be easier to find slots. coming in second is rogue, then mage. There are going to be a lot of mages...
---
Holy cow you are such a legend! Thank you!
---
To be technical, Crossrealm Battlegrounds are not responsible for the function that teleports players to the BG - that's actually Battlemasters.  I believe they were added in the summer of 2005, with patch 1.6.0.  For many people, any function that was in Vanilla is 'fair game' for Classic, and Battlemasters were available throughout *most* of vanilla.  Crossrealm Battlegroups didn't change this process, nor did it change the matching process that already existed since the dawn of BGs, it just gave you a larger pool of participants.  
---
That said:  I don't plan to PvP so I have no opinion on Crossrealm Battlegrounds being added to Classic.
---
It's not going to happen, and it's not a good idea.
---
Can we stop with all these redundant posts?
---
I definitely think it's a natural extension of it, but I'd never assume Loot Council includes publicly tracked and specific duration (60-day/etc) attendance rates.  Normally it's just "Yeah, we take attendance into account too"
---
Affliction with a touch of demo for survival (I dont know the exact numbers). Succubus is a gorgeous CC and both of them being cows meant no wotf which helped a lot.
---
As soon as you get better tanking gear in MC you can have one tank take all the adds and then burn the boss. Tank shieldwalls at 50%, adds explode. Easy peasy, even with only two banishes.
---
Charge and intercept also have a minimum range. You can effectively kite them between melee range and intercept range, assuming the "melee leeway" gets toned down a bit
---
I agree with you, but I do think there is some valid fear from people lower on the dps meters. I've seen raid leaders (even in more casual guilds) limit raid slots for warlocks, hunters, and hybrid dps because they can't keep up. Not that they are trying to exclude individual players, just "we really don't need more than 3 warlocks when we have mages and rogues waiting on the sidelines. We need more damage for this fight".
---
We're no longer in EST, we're in EDT, and 2 pm PDT is 5 pm EDT. It goes live at 5 pm on the East Coast.
---
Like some others are saying, re-evaluate how you go about dealing with classes that you cant take 100 to 0 in a single stun lock (warriors, warlocks sometimes, etc).
---
With my gear, most open world pvp I encounters I can take the opponent from 100% to 0% by just doing: Cheap shot, Backstab, thistle tea, Backstab, Backstab.  Sometimes I go for a Kidney shot right after thistle tea (to be safe), and then Backstab.  It totally depends on the gear/health/class of who you are fighting.  For orcs, I usually dont even both with stuns.  Garrote is a good opener on orcs.  Garrote/Rupture are very effective against feral druids and warriors.

---
Why world buffs are stupid. 
---
At the end.
---
TLDR your post in depth. 
---
My guild will be using DKP with a loot council for TF, Ateshi, and MT, but everything else will be DKP. 
---
People have asked if we will put priorities on items, but to me thats just a step away from loot council and you'd have drama either way. You set up priorities for specific items like azuresong mage blade and the people not on that priority list get butt hurt. You don't set up the priority list and people get butt hurt. I feel like its just too much effort. 
---
So other than some Legendaries and gear for the MT, everything is DKP and if you can use it and want to bid on it... Go for it. If you bid on something that you probably shouldn't I'm sure some people in the guild will call you stupid and you probably wont do it again lol.
---
Oh! I must have completely missed them all lol. Skipped the “walking” parts and I guess I must have cropped a few of the procs off when that happened :)
---
there were no add ons, the internet repositories and guides were slim to none, and no youtube. Molten Core was designed so that raids would learn how to raid through trial and error...
---
nowadays each raid is broken down in guides and on youtube, with perfectly written boss timers for your addons, before it hits live.  as a result, the coordination aspect has been heightened to increase the challenge.
---
Molten Core could be carried by 15 geared / capable raiders carrying 25 people using auto attack or using 3 button rotations back in the day.
---
I mean.. it’s bound to happen sooner or later if someone’s incompetent enough to lose their job and family because they have no control about playing

---
Thanks, this guy is just a fucking virgin when it comes to PvP in vanilla. Jesus, if you’re a paladin and see a shaman coming at you just bubble hearth.
---
Okay this is fair I didnt look and see PvP as the focus. Yes Paladins &gt; Shamans as PvP support. But Orc and Undead are still powerhouse PvP races.

I’m thinking about rolling Warlock. I’ll be playing alliance because that’s where all my friends will be, but I’ve seen a lot of chatter around here that alliance warlocks get stomped in PVP because of the undead racial. At the same time, the warlock play style seems really cool to me, and i like the idea of having a pet. I do plan on playing mostly PVP, with a bit of PVE sprinkled in. I’m a pretty casual player, probably playing 5-10 hours a week. My question is, are Alliance warlocks really at that much of a disadvantage in PvP? I’m thinking about going human warlock, as I don’t love the gnome appearance.
---
I made so much gold off the AH from those!
---
Imp Conq? Ret Aura was new in TBC iirc.
---
At least on private servers, using battle shout also resets your swing timer. So some things will, others wont.
---
It's treason, then.
---
Glaring weakness: they're giant sponges so they're harder to heal because they can't mitigate damage easily.
---
Pros: Threat. SO MUCH THREAT.
---
I'm not saying you are a basement dweller, I was actually implying that I suspected you to be calling me that next. My wording does imply as much.
---
Blizzard introduced XP gains from PVP later on did they not? It would suggest that they did not want to deliberately become very strong at earlier levels in PVP.
---
As I do not plan on buying items as I level this time round I hold zero sense of entitlement towards something I do not want. 
---
It was something I saw when levelling in vanilla and I personally think it is nice to have your gear at respectable standard as you level as not to seem underpowered.
---
People twinking eliminate this option regardless of mental gymnastics and I am somewhat baffled at why I had to highlight that new players do not have as much gold as players rolling alts to twink.
---
Evidently we view this very differently, it's just disappointing that people feel the need to downvote posts they do not agree with.
---
Ah, 2005.  Doomsday Machine, Character, and Demigod were all the new albums that I listened to on loop.  Good times, good times.
---
&gt; i think what they should do is let people queue up for bgs from anywhere and don't do xrealm.
---
Poor people trying to level up at that point.
---
I'm not sure but I think account sharing is against ToS so yes, probably. If it was up to me I think I'd allow it for health reasons (allow a healthier alternative to staying awake for a week or close to it) so maybe they'll look the other way, but who knows.
---
They wanna stare at orc booty all day and/or like the smaller form of the female orcs.

Rogue One is overrated.
---
It's an annoyance, it's not horrible. You just need to spot when they use it and react accordingly. Just takes a bit more skill. It's only 5 seconds.
---
It's really just a matter of getting one warlock and two rogues in.  You young punks...
---
Warriors NEED deep wounds, because it is a prerequisite for impale - and it is foolish to "not recommend" impale.
---
It started with a car chasing scene and just felt totally stupid in many regards. I'm not a huge Star Wars nerd by any stretch of the imagination but Solo felt totally off.
---
I enjoyed ep 8 much more in the cinema (obviously learned to hate it outside of the social popcorn cinema friends &amp; fun time) than I enjoyed Solo. I don't know what the hell they were thinking when they thought that up.
---
Are there any classes who can viably tank other than warriors?
---
If I need to create a blacklist spreadsheet I will.
---
GET THE ESCALADE!
---
Shamans have tremor totems.
---
Damn, that’s inconsequential. Thanks.
---
Depends on your playstyle and comp
---
Aw man, it's tough! On one hand, you might not have to share much gear with the mage if you're a shaman, so that's a plus.
---
As a warlock you might end up sharing gear, but you can do just about any quest together out in the world and not die because you have a pet/fear/dots and they have slows.
---
Kill? I thought that rogue wanted to give me a backmessage, that mage helped me chill my water and armor and that shaman sticks these nice little artworks into the ground. I wonder if he sells them.
---
Im gonna get some hate for this but I seriously think this is one of the most overrated scenes in a movie I can think of off the top of my head. Maybe part of it is I just dont like Star Wars that much but I heard about this "legendary scene" before seeing the movie and even had one person straight up tell me it was the action scene of the year and Vader just force chokes some extras and blocks a few laser beams..... literally stuff that has been in pretty much every other Star Wars movie

Or... get some actual sleep and not be a mongoloid. I think blizz would look the other way bc it’s not a big deal, but not for health reasons. I would say ppl who breach TOS should be marked unable to receive credit though.
---
That way they cheated , got the down even if they don’t get credit, but they’ll know in their hearts they did it
---
As a raid leader from Vanilla to Wrath, I hate loot.  It was the single worst part of raiding.  It slowed down momentum of the raid, it caused unnecessary drama, and as much as I hate to say it I wanted the gear for myself.  It was hard to share, it was annoying to do loot councils and DKP, and I would much rather in Classic just raid with drunk adults and have everything rolled on a need or greed (main spec, off spec) basis and care more about having a good time than gaining gear.
---
We're talking first few days here. There aren't going to be enough people *not* in the guild attempting this to make that an issue. It's not like the guilds going for this are going to all be rolling on the same server or something.
---
They got their server where they can create characters with their names n shit, if they don’t stay there it’s welcome to the real with accompanying rules
---
&gt; Not mobile at all?!? It’s easily the second most mobile class after Druids. 
---
Uh no... ?
---
Mages have Blink, Rogues have Sprint, Shaman has Ghost Wolf.
---
Hunters only have Cheetah and using it in a duel is a bad idea.
---
I don't like the 2 worlds to collide.
---
true. but a lot of those sites seem to take the time blizzard posted on the forums and use a converter to change the time to the users local. For instance, when i click on your link, it says "today 4:00 pm". The link to mmo-champion says 4:00 pm EST, which is technically correct, but just causing confusion.

Thank you for this!

Player here who came back for Cata / Mop / WOD and dropped it within a few months. Legion was the first Expac since WOTLK That I really played and enjoyed. I honestly think they knocked it out of the park.  
---
 Legendaries were amazing in my opinion ( The thrill of getting a drop felt like getting epics in classic / tbc), Artifact weapons were incredible, pvp was fairly balanced, and the art was beautiful. Class identity never felt so strong even in classic in my opinion. The artifact quests were awesome, class halls made you feel like you were actually a part of your class.   
---
The story was a bit out there but it was epic as hell and I enjoyed it even as someone who doesn't pve much. It also introduced mythic dungeons which was clearly a huge hit.   
---
Legion doesn't get enough credit IMO.

---
TBC is the best hands down, but damn it I'm more than happy to settle for Classic!
---
But your link just proves yourself wrong? That link explicitly says "after phase 1". Not _half_ of phase 1. Huge difference.
---
&gt;Nope, because Classic doesn't have sharding.
---
Well that's the whole point. The difference between layering and sharding is that layering is continent-wide, whereas sharding is per zone.
---
Classic ain't private servers. It isn't even vanilla. Even if blizzard kept every line of code the same from way back then classic would still be a different game because the players have changed.
---
Imagine putting TBC above WOTLK and MoP on the same level as WoD.
---
Check out voivid (60 warlock on pserver), he owns people naked/ with no armor on. So yes it's very viable in blues lol. Really godlike with proper gear
---
The fuck are you talking about? The name reservation that everyone gets access to? What does that have to do with streamers?
---
Oh... well it’s just about doing Mara for the hit ring and getting mask from UD anyway. Easy
---
I think Tauren is also a good race choice for pvp because of the increased attack range and more health and war stomp.
---
because they've been heavily sharded, not sure if they're doing the same for classic
---
I know I came into the BWL after it was on farm. They gave me all the tier mage drops, and didn't charge me any DKP cause no one else needed em... But Im pretty sure I simply didn't gain any points for a little while.  If they would have put me into the negative, I think I'd have been pissed.  (I was at war from end of Rag - BWL progression)
---
Duels aren't class templates against class templates either, they're characters against characters.
---
I'm glad you can admit when you're wrong.
---
I need the ram though.
---
I think the leveling process was fun the first time but also exemplified why I just dont like retail at all anymore. It felt like you were led on a crafted path and you really didnt do much actual exploring on your own. Just follow the quests and almost never go back once you complete an area. Their answer to this in legion was to let you pick your order of the zones which was cool but essentially you still just ran the zone in a circle and then were done. Did it once on each faction and never cared to do it again
---
No clue. Rogue sounds fun but so does warrior

It's a little late to complain about it now after a constant year of harassing Blizzard with "1.12 #nochanges" spam.

You didn't get beta, you got the stress test. Shit is buggy and always says different names in the drop down menu of the launcher.

I’m quitting my job and going spend about a month playing Classic all day. I have enough money saved for now then I’ll probably look for another job after the first month 🤗
---
Not really. I can see there are differences, of course... but there are also similarities. I am not saying that it is likely to happen or even should happen. Just wondering if it would happen. It is many many many moons away from even being possible tho as we would need Classic TBC to launch first

You say stuffy but I see it more as a stone giant keeping you warm and safe within its clutch.

This makes you perhaps the only person on this subreddit who I'm certain actually played a vanilla warlock, and was pretty good at it, besides. Updoot.

---
Many feel that Solo's story was better left to his own tales of it through the expanded universe. Better to leave the scoundrel's past uncertain with only a few of his old friends knowing the truth. You let him tell his stories and hear his friend's responses and it builds the lore and mystery.
---
Showing the story is like seeing the movie monster in the first scene - it removes the wonder and mystery and robs the imagination a little.
---
I enjoyed the movie, but I feel like it diluted the legend of Han Solo.
---
Yes, mage is literally that simple for raiding.
---
If they take your role into account, I'm going to be pissed.

If you can click play on the beta you can play even now. If you can’t you probably won’t be able to and it’s showing because you have the beta client installed.

Why would this be the factor of which race? They all get it
---
Balance druid.
---
depends if u raid or not. if u don't raid there are a few epic world drops + some boe drops from mc and maybe u can pay a guild to give u the leaf (starts the bow quest) at majordomus fight for ur hunter, if u choose to play one.
---
then there are some things u can build with profession or get via reputation from for example alterac valley. darkmoon gives u a trinket at a later stage in the game.
---
zul gurub can also be a very casual raid with some epics. 
---
so yes, there are ways to obtain epics but overall u will stay in blues for a long time. 
---
and adding to ur whole post and the replies: keep in mind that both wl and hunter are very hard to play to get their full potential out. u have way more keybindings than other classes + a pet. can be quite an overload for new players. but if u like one of those classes u will figure it out.

Another question for the books, will promotional items like this or Blizzcon be included at some point if they continue to release TBC and WOTLK?
---
I think blizzard is going to miss the boat again on people, guilds, and websites selling gold for cash in wow classic.
---
hello,
---
my friend and i played vanilla and bc and we are also former arena gods but quit to let others to have fun but also because wow started to suck dogshit. now we need help from random strangers because we are indecisive and we appreciate the opinions of the nerds who we will be crunching in the near future.
---
now heres the sitch. we have weighed the pros and cons and have arrived at a few choices:
---
tauren druid/undead rogue:
---
+ invisible bleed guys
---
+ no night elf
---
+ undead rogues are the spookiest ones
---
+ sap is funny
---
+ stealth runs
---
- so many rogues
---
- resto druids aren't very op
---
night elf druid/gnome rogue:
---
+ easy access to red defias mask
---
- resto aint op
---
dwarf paladin/gnome warrior:
---
+ op smasher boys
---
+ cool beards
---
+ healbot + execute = dumb
---
- a million warriors
---
- gear dependent
---
gnome warlock/dwarf paladin
---
+ free horses
---
+ op leveling duo
---
+ doomguard in westfall
---
+ kinda snowflakes
---
- don't give off a crunch feelin
---
- wotf is fkkin cheap
---
thank you friends, look forward to kickin ur a** (butt)
---
love,
---
- the kids
---
Overall, Solo was decent, the problem is that the main actor was complete garbage and got carried by amazing actors and performances the entire time. Every time dude was in a scene, he might as well have literally been on the back of the actor/actress he was with.
---
Donald Glover, Daenarys, Woody Harrelson etc. were fucking great. Some of their scenes were slightly spoiled by Han's shitty performance though. Idk whose dick that dude sucked to get the role, but he never should have gotten it to begin with. You don't take big risks like that with a huge franchise like SW. He was the acting equivalent of Anakin (kid and teenager) in the prequels.
---
[This is a low budget fan film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvPfCTyd3X8) with shitty fight choreography, but it showcases how amazing a young Han Solo is when played both aesthetically and vocally correct. If they would have picked someone like him to play Han, the movie would have been more in line with Rogue One in terms of overall quality. Having your main actor be shit really bogs down the entire film no matter how good the rest of it is.
---
Hardly anyone thinks Han Solo was a trash movie, it just had a trash lead and it really made the whole movie "decent" at best because of it, when it could have been much more.
---
for pve:
---
its hit chance
---
for pvp:
---
it does nothing
---
Actually, I want pvp to be my main focus with raiding just there to get gear and progress.
---
I would have gone (L-&gt;R) Work, Family, Wife, Life.
---
The problem is that release is so far away and most people here can only talk about it. I'm fairly certain that once it releases people will start playing the hype train trio (mage warrior and rogue), get halfway there, the reroll to what they really want to play. It's the exact reason most classes are played on live. Yea there is flavor of the month stuff, but most raids still have a pretty good mix.
---
People will always hype things up till release. Look at games like Anthem. In early access, every review said it was the greatest thing in the world, and look at it now. Classic is the greatest thing in the world since no one is playing it yet. People are watching streamers and theorizing everything at the moment. Once it comes out, people will just be playing it.
---
1-21 yesterday, yes. Only 10 today
---
No one would be able to find it
---
not in a raid setting
---
Why is alliance lock so low? Is it cause horde PvP locks?
---
I never considered 2-hand prot build.  I'm gonna look into this - thank for a new take on prot build!
---
Comparing Revenge of the Sith to WoD?
---
*pulls out saber* It’s treason then.
---
I'm confused as to how you interpret that from my message.
---
I don't blame anyone for not wanting to associate with GRIZZLY- I'm just saying that I don't believe the current state of GRIZZLY is accurately reflect by its reputation and I hope with time and publicity that will become clear.
---
Fact is, it hasn't become clear, so I couldn't blame someone for going off of what they know in the absence of real proof of the opposite.
---
My word is not enough and I know that.
---
This is all pure gold
---
subbed for the stress test?
---
&gt; Nice to know thought it was only them.
---
Why would you think that? It's genuinely blowing my mind.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself friend
---
A lot of it was client-side for me. My poor little mobile Radeon just couldn't render that many polygons at once.
---
Everyone gets the client, only certain people can log in. This is the current working idea at least
---
Yes, I was in a guild called Kabal on Dethecus, we had MC, BWL on farm and were working through AQ40 when I quit the game. What was your toon name?
---
No changes.
---
There it is...I know the feeling, having raided as a (failed) spriest! I would never roll a druid to only  heal.
---
Get an SSD if you haven't already, you'll see that performance jump again.
---
Yes, for pve raiding obviously.  How much hit rating though?  If it drops the hit cap to 6%, then that is substantial.  If it only reduces it 0.04% per pt, that's worthless.  Maybe getting 8% instead of 9%.
---
The numbers have been run extensively and both Pala's and Druids are "viable" on the road to 60. But both suffer when certain mechanics or skills are needed in raid content. A lot of progression guilds run with a Druid in their tank team for a variety of reasons.  
---
Warriors tool kit is just so perfect and superior. Paladins have a whole heap of issue related to taunts, mana, stamina limitiation due to gearing issue in raid content, as an avid prot pala myself i have had some success as a 3rd / 4th tank in a raiding guild with a back up healing talent to allow me to support, occasionally being the OT when the normal OT wasn't present. But dont expect to be MT or OT as a pala tbh.   
---
If your serious about tanking, go warrior unless your prepared to battle through the prejudice and prove yourself in a guild of like minded folk.
---
What else does take attendance into account mean?
---
curse of DOOM!
---
EU players
---
This is big brain as fuck.
---
Tauren, plainsrunning in an open field Ned!
---
played gnome warlock for like.. 10 years and the undead thing is way overblown.
---
sure its annoying, but just remember to save death coil for them and to be ready to reapply fear.
---
Chamber of Aspects...is that a real server name? Have never seen that one before
---
It's an entitlement attached to the CD key.
---
It isn't a second key I had to enter on a website or in-game.
---
They are 2nd most popular on the alliance.  If you're looking at the overall figures you have to remember that only one faction gets them in classic.
---
I am absolutely sold on battlegrounds and can't wait to grind them at 60. That's primarily what I want to do.
---
That being said, does anyone know if we will be able to queue for multiple BGs, or are you limited in vanilla to picking a specific BG to queue for? That would be the one disappointment for me. I don't remember which it was and I can't seem to find that info.
---
is rag doable with barely and FR and low dps? has it been done? i remember it being a pain to do with low FR among the raid.
---
Tauren Druid named Bullshift
---
if I were up against a Rogue, I would get Scatter Shot and Intimidate from BM.
---
Deterrence is also pretty good.
---
Trinket Kidney, play Orc.
---
To be honest I think battlegrounds ruined world PVP. Results seem to vary per realm but I know on the one I played on people quickly lost interest. Which is a real shame because you are either fighting across sometimes multiple zones, or are you are in a repetitive instanced area with considerably less people.
---
The better solution IMO would have been to integrate more of the PVP rewards system into the open word, which a number of MMOs since have done extremely well even though they were severely lacking in other aspects.
---
I actually originally started playing WOW for the large PVP battles, once those dried up I completely lost interest in WOW PVP permanently.
---
10, 15, and 20 man raids also exist.  What's your point?
---
Aren’t holy priests the best healers?
---
I mean I wouldn't say no to being paid to play video games, but that's not the cause of this. I'm just not oblivious to hypocrisy
---
Yea, I had the skyfury helm in my inventory too, which was like an ever boxier version
---
some euroneet pserver guild will do it for sure
---
I'm already one step ahead with 2tb of NVME but thanks ^^
---
How dare I
---
I've had the same experience. After my first toon I thought WoD leveling was amazing. My second? Not so much...
---
You say stuffy. I say an architectural beauty that keeps you warm and safe within its clutch.
---
Oh good point. Supposedly private servers had the fire resists too low/too high
---
They dont have to put the redeem guy in the game again. Those who have them on live get them on classic (tbc). Again, I am not saying its for sure has to happen because people got ce pets. Just saying that people can easily connect the dots and there are plenty of people with TCG items they would want to have at some point, lol
---
Legion was awesome, one of my favorites. As good as Wrath. I’d love to see another space as good as Legion come around again.
---
Shadow priest undoubtably.
---
Has only 3 damaging spells, you almost never want to drop Sform, and dispelling is easy enough.
---
I don't know that there is a racial check, as long as you are a Hunter of the appropriate level you should be able to take the quest in either location. Only way to know for sure would be to try it in the Beta.
---
You know it will happen
---
Alot of  things are different on beta and pservers. This is because pserver developers never had all the info from vanilla so they had to guess. Different private servers did many things differently, everything from proc rates to debuff priority. 
---
Take everything you hear about private servers with a grain of salt.
---
Druid is a good for getting loots too.  People try to only bring 1-3 in raids.
---
that's a lvl70 dagger from TBC. wasn't available in vanilla, obviously.
---
Lol at "give top threat"
---
It won't feel that way.  Double your numbers if you want to see how much of the Alliance they'll be.
---
Fire rogues?
---
Can you read or are you that hard headed..
---
Well you were talking about questing when you’re probably going to have a voidwalker out. A lock should in theory never get a fear out on a mage since they should save cs for it which is a 10 second lockout with mage burst being so disgusting you shouldn’t live 10 seconds of free casting. You can fear out of coil but coil can be blocked which is what block should be saved for and there’s a stupid addon that gives a sound notification to press block when a coil is coming. In the world if you’re jumped by a mage you probably won’t have a Felhunter out, I don’t see why you’d ever have a Felhunter out over a voidwalker when you’re out questing or farming shards in the world. Even if you do have one out the mage is going to try and fight close where cone will hit both you and the Felhunter or even just poly you and kill the Felhunter, drop combat and eat/drink. Mage also has decurse for tongues and agony and 1st row talents for enemy less chance to resist.
---
My perception is probably skewed though because I’ve been playing a lot on “try hard pvp tournament server can’t say names on this sub” where the people on it are mostly practicing duels and the average player generally understands all classes, all their tools, and what the “right” decisions are in a 1v1. I also don’t see sl much there because even though an sl lock should probably never lose to anyone in a 1v1 people aren’t playing it there because it’s seen as the ultra cheap noob spec that I’ve even heard has been banned in duel tournaments.
---
I feel like on the average retail classic server once a warlock hits 42 he’s going to win 9/10 1v1s in the world though, regardless of wotf.
---
Sorry for the ‘ignorant statement’ I’ve just seen so many people here that haven’t played or barely played vanilla and have questionable preconceptions from seeing a few upvoted Reddit threads/comments or hearing the opinion of 1 or 2 classic beta streamers/YouTubers focused on top level min maxing.
---
4pm for you would be correct as well.
---
Oh, you mean that video where he said people who were sniping him?
---
That's very different. From Griefing....
---
Asmongold is an absolute tool, but he does not represent the streamers as a whole.
---
Maybe try putting together an argument where you aren't arguing strawmen and doesn't stink far away of entitlement from YOUR side.
---
Yep!  I thought so.  I was (and still am) Genericrogue.  Though I'm now on a different server.  I specifically remember meeting you and Twitcharilus (troll warrior) while leveling in STV and you guys were the first two in-game buddies I ever had on Dethecus.
---
Username checks out!
---
Too*
---
You literally proved yourself wrong... Take a break, dude, your troll failed horribly.
---
gnome warriors are the. best. warriors. on aliance. escape artist &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything others have. plus you're short and can hide in bushes in BGs. they'll never see you coming and before they even know it, they're dead.
---
Where would they go?
---
We can just throw them out like heartless monsters
---
I think the problem many people have with it is that they said there would be no cross-over from the retail game and Classic. This is the first cross-over. People are now wondering how far that will go. They could very easily stop it there, or they could include Promotional items (Blizzcon, etc) and TCG items and maybe other stuff down the line too, who the hell knows
---
Maybe he means human and maces
---
They can out DPS mages in MC.
---
Fair point, I just personally don't wanna play as a cow lol, always thought of them as more of the side-character type
---
God you’re a nerd for knowing this and I love it. Insects you’re a mad lad.
---
Stress test shows Classic for everyone. Hopefully, they will expand the Beta soon.
---
Just find a guild that doesn’t care about them
---
Well everyone knows about em now. And they’re great for leveling. So, I disagree.
---
I agree the world record is going to be shattered. I think a lot of people fail to realize that _record_ was just the fastest **documented** speed run at the time. And let's be honest, this was a time long before everyone and their grandmother was trying to be internet famous and make money off google videos/youtube. There simply wasn't any competition at the time.
---
I'm willing to believe some of them just don't know...
---
play what you want when you want is not vanilla design, that's retail design
---
if bgs are popular enough for instant queues, you'd get instant queues without xrealm.  breaking down the realm community aspect of pvp to let people bg whenever they want is anti-vanilla
---
Thanks a lot for the quicks answers we're super hyped for Classic
---
True, but that comes with the huge drawback of, well, being a gnome.
---
The working theory is that they should just be removed from your character if you enter a raid instance. So they should stick around for world content but not for raids.
---
I'll be the one..... FUCK RIGHT OFF NO CHANGES!!!
---
Are you a streamer? If no, you're in the stress test.
---
I mean, iirc the auction house and bank in SW were literally across the street from one another and the FP was one block away. Convenience to raid zones makes sense but as far as actual aesthetic appeal... I don’t see it.
---
Priest or resto sham? Deep down I want to main sham but it seems they will be the most popular horde healer. I’m worried about not getting invites due to the large supply?
---
My only concern with priests are leveling, if anyone has insight as to how leveling as a priest is, would be greatly appreciated :)
---
All guilds will care about them
---
On the healing point they can but you only get one mistake a dungeon which can be painful.
---
Remove them from raids. Done.
---
The point of the macro is to prevent exactly this.  If I'm the tank, I don't want to switch... but If I had to switch to shield while out soloing, this macro will switch me back to 2 Hand before I use the ability to maximize damage... in 1 key press.  
---
In group situations where I am the tank, mistakes still happen if you have to actively press macros to stance dance or weapon swap.  Tailoring your macros to make sure you are configured correctly isn't a bad thing. 
---
 It minimizes human error.  Obviously as I run into situations where a macro like this messes up more frequently than I make my own mistakes, I'd either adapt it, or trash it if it is commonly detrimental to the group.
---
But if it puts your mind at ease, I do have separate weapon and stance macro's.  I just want to see how something like this will work because I am human...
---
no, thats nostalgia, post-ironic unironically ironic memes is where it's at now
---
Nah
---
could work, do you think their feelings would be hurt?
---
Good argument... idiot
---
As I said elsewhere, having played Druid all through Vanilla, it's like being that kid the teacher hates. You have to put in A+ effort to get a B- at best. No bullshit, a half-afk mage in blues pressing one button will do the same DPS as you in near-bis gear doing godly powershiting rotations. I cri evry tiem.
---
That said, I did stick with Druid all the way through Cata for a reason: they are hella fun, and the insane versatility is worth it. You can literally do anything with sufficient effort, and the PvP is amazing. 
---
That said, this time around, I will not roll druid. It's just too much... I'm older now and I don't have time to do everything. I kinda just want to do one job and do it well; maybe have a fun alt to goof around with.
---
You think it will simultaneously be wildly different than both private servers and actual vanilla?  I bet it's the other way around.
---
Some people like healing, but with the nature of the game, being healing specced is a handicap anywhere but dungeons and raids.
---
There are items already in the game that can enhance some of these "meme spec" type builds. 
---
For example, Rag trinket "Essence of Pure Flame" + shield "Skullflame shield" basically double the damage of ret aura + add a very frequent AOE to all targets in melee range, almost doubling the AOE threat capability of Prot paladins. 
---
Only downside is the shield is a very expensive BOE epic drop, but the Rag trinket probably won't be super sought after by tanks so you might get 1st or 2nd crack at it!
---
Prot paladins don't have a spot in the "Meta" of raiding, but they are absolutely capable of doing 5-mans and tanking a lot of raid trash in certain instances.  They can be effective offtanks for a raid on non-focus targets because they're quite durable and just need a bit of time to build threat (since they have no taunt), so if you split a pack in two and have the paladin take a few at the beginning of the fight, they'll be stuck to the Pal once 10-20 sec have passed and the rest of the raid has killed the rest of the pack =P
---
he's on the beta, there's none on the AH on the beta
---
I personally think that the world buffs earned from raiding should remain viable for raiding. That is the ZG buff and the Ony head buff. Things like DM North tribute and songflower should not be allowed inside a raid.
---
&gt; I hope my interactions with European players during the last stress test isn't a good representations of them in general. 
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
If BRD/UBRS, etc can be 10 manned, it will be easy to get a warrior or two geared. But..within a week? Yea, I'd expect people to share accounts at that point. Not to mention general lag deaths, servers farting, other people killing the same mobs, etc. It all add's up.
---
Now..if the guild has a bunch of people behind them (such as streamers), it will more than likely be possible. Given gold, items, etc for free can have a huge impact.
---
in one post they elaborated how they have VPN, and virtual servers to run the client of the shared accounts so it will all come from the same "desktop" at the same IP as far as blizzard can tell.
---
It’s a prestige item. Should stay in the guild not go to someone who has not put the effort into being able to farm that raid as a guild. I ran a LOT of ZG back in the day. Never saw one drop ever.
---
Go do looking for raid if you want faceroll content.
---
They should be considered an exploit and be removed from players the moment you enter a raid.
---
I hope not.
---
but I hear the raids and world buffs are really close, would be a shame to separate them
---
There didn't used to be an AH in SW
---
Wait....so because people didnt figure it out until AQ it shouldnt be allowed?  You have more of an argument, right?  That on its own is a fucking retarded reason to take them out.
---
DPSing as a cat druid is like being that kid the teacher hates. You have to put in A+ effort to get a B- at best. No bullshit, a half-afk mage in blues pressing one button will do the same DPS as you in near-bis gear doing godly powershiting rotations. I cri evry tiem.
---
no thats simply not true
---
I never take Dirty Deeds because I'm usually opening up with Backstab or Ambush, depending on spec. Time your opener so you'll get your next energy tick right after.
---
With 5/5 Nightslayer:
---
0:00 - 120 Energy - Ambush/Backstab - 2 combo points
---
0:01 - 80 Energy
---
1:51 - 80 Energy - Backstab - 4 combo points
---
2:01 - 40 Energy
---
3:01 - 40 Energy - Kidney Shot (5 seconds)
---
4:01 - 35 Energy
---
6:01 - 55 Energy
---
7:01 - 55 Energy - Blind (10 seconds)
---
8:01 - 45 Energy
---
10:01 - 65 Energy
---
12:01 - 85 Energy
---
14:01 - 105 Energy
---
16:01 - 115 Energy
---
18:01 - 120 Energy

20:00 - 120 Energy Ambush/Backstab - 2 combo points
---
20:01 - 80 Energy
---
21:50 - Backstab - 4 combo points
---
22:01 - 40 Energy
---
23:00 - CB+Evis
---
If anything goes wrong, you've got plenty of utility to regain control.
---
It would be completely unnecessary to roll a second warrior just to be a Tauren. An orc warrior can MT
---
All need to be removed from raids.
---
JESUS CHRIST THESE GUYS ARE NUTS.
---
&gt;And the addition of arenas to PVP? They divorce PVP from practically every aspect of the WoW MMO experience by nullifying the relevance of faction, removing the 'massive' part of multiplayer, and canonizing a gear pipeline in a sterile environment around which pvp balance was to be predicated for years to come.
---
Battlegrounds did this first. I thought I was PVPing for fun but apparently it was for rewards and those had to be done via considerably smaller instanced PVP areas. That you had to queue for.
---
Listen to the podcast.
---
The devs feelings? Nah, I dont think they ever really intended people to use them this way. They intended them to be in the game, obviously but not like this. In TBC they removed the DM North Tribute buffs because people were still using them to clear TBC raids. Its very obvious that it got out of control at some point and Blizzard put a stop to it. The thing is, that point wasnt until very late Vanilla / early TBC. Now that we have had the private server scene for like a decade, everyone will abuse these buffs from day one. I think the buffs earned from raids (Hakaar heart buff and Ony head buff) should remain for raid buffs but the ones earned from a dungeon or from the world should be removed for raids.
---
I agree with all of this. I had so much fun in the early days and didn't really know what was going on. I didn't even start understanding the numbers under my class until BC and Karazhan even though I did lots of MC raids (never went beyond that but we did ok in MC)
---
No role check, if you want a healer then get a group from world chat.
---
Hunter, easy to gear if  you get into a guild and most guilds only take like 3 so you gear super quick. Your tier sets are great for pvp and your PvE build is viable for PvP.  
---
Other option is a lock, but more gear dependant and more of a class canon in raid spec
---
which podcast?
---
I do a lot of other stuff, but it's all stuff I want to do; music, writing, consuming epic amounts of alcohol. I definitely admire people who give up their life in order to procreate, but it's something for several reasons I could never do. My issue isn't with family people either. I have issues with people who are working their arse off, making lots of money, then complaining that they don't have any time to enjoy that money. That in my mind is a retarded waste of time.
---
Are you blind?
---
My guild was pretty casual and we used world buffs during BWL progression.
---
Checkout PiHole. It's for your entire home network without installing anything!
---
If I plan to play holy priest, will I have trouble farming gold or killing mobs in whatever I need to do solo?
---
I'd ideally not like to switch to shadow every time I need to kill things, but I guess that's always a problem for healers.
---
My man! To me MC was just a series of green bars for the longest time
---
My friends seemed to dislike it until bfa came out and realized it wasn’t so bad, things could get worse. Legion at least felt like an expansion, the world was cool, we got new stuff. Bfa just kept the parts people didn’t like like world quests, mobile game missions, ap grind, azerite gear which is the same or worse than legendaries. Added a smaller and less varied world, and things people don’t particularly enjoy like warfronts and island expeditions.
---
It's significant, but it isn't nearly as significant as what say, a CB /Prep rogue sacrifices, or Arms warrior, etc.
---
As far as sacrifices goes for a raid spec it's significant, but one of the smaller sacrifices.
---
Username does not check out...
---
I meant the world buffs feelings, like they might feel left out
---
On a private server.
---
Warlock question! 
---
* Thoughts on drain tanking vs. traditional VW+DoT leveling methods in terms of speed?
---
* I'll be duo leveling with a warrior
---
Problem with WoD was that it offered nothing outside of raiding. Facebook waiting game to inflate money to stupendous amounts, good raids, ... ? ??? ??? ? ? ? 
---
For anyone who's not heavily invested in raiding the expansion offered literally no content.
---
The questing experience was hella nice but considering it only lasted a couple hours that hardly saved the expansion.
---
You just spam tab target+dot, looks ace when you've got a bunch of numbers popping up on your screen
---
Autism.
---
It's quite obvious you never played vanilla.  If you are healer spec you are in a raiding guild.  If you are in a raiding guild there are always people doing things that are easier with a healer there.  I don't think things will be that much different from vanilla, and if you really want to get shit done as a healer all you have to do is say "I want to do this thing and I need people to heal" and you've got a full group.
---
Don't pretend like no one wants to group with healers, lol.
---
Why are people disliking My name. Its dope
---
....so? I’m not sure what server you played on, but everyone I knew in vanilla knew these were a thing. It shouldn’t be changed.
---
Only Blizzard gets to decide what is an exploit, not you.
---
yes I just happen to have a braille monitor
---
&gt; Fetal DoT’s 
---
wut
---
Lol wow project much? I can't believe how rude and close minded your post is. Ever occur to you that some people, who are human beings just like you, don't *want* to have children? Don't *want* to be married? Who find join joy in a wonderful game where they can feel at home, or on vacation, in a place they otherwise couldn't? I think you're the pathetic one for assuming that your "ideal" or "chosen" lifestyle is superior to those who enjoy time alone. I, for one, feel sorry for you. I myself am in the middle. I love WoW, and I have a few hobbies and a solid group of friends. But screw everything else. **Disclaimer** I'm not bagging on anyone who enjoys anything I did not defend here. I think it's beautiful that people want to start families, have children, live life to a different potential. Not me though! Classic all the way, baby.
---
Good point. Go put your helmet back on and stick to live wow. LFR sounds like the perfect fit for you.
---
Warlock sounds like the best for you. Plus the SM/ruin spec is basically like 95% optimal for both pve and pvp, so you can do everything without respeccing.
---
i need that big dick HP, bro.
---
Yoiu realize that Classic TBC isnt a thing yet, how can you say how an entitlement works. Yes, I know it didn't work that way in retail. You had to redeem the code online then take another code to the guy in Booty Bay. However, the item exists on your account its easy to tie that into a Classic TBC reward. Guy, I have been nothing but accepting of your view and even went as far to say that its the likely outcome but you have shown no respect for anyone elses views. I understand you feel strongly on this subject but come on
---
No because i need money to play classic.
---
Just brainstorming a bit. I personally am a fan of the loot/class council form where all of the raiders in a single class get together and talk about personal/ideal priority for items. The only real issue with this system is that players can refuse to "backdown" from loot that they want high priority on, and you an also just have weird situations where a player seems to run into multiple pieces back to back to back making it feel imbalanced to those who are not recieving loot.
---
It seems, in my estimation, that the best thing you could do is apply tiers of important to gear, based on slot importance, state shanges, class performance increases and the like. Then you appoint a DKP value to those tiers. Anything that is in tier 1 costs 100 DKP, tier 2 is 75, so on and so forth. After that doing something like comparing last date of loot achieved, and position on meters (or whatever metric) can lead you to find out who is in line to get the next piece of gear. If it's time for someone to get gear and they don't have the DKP for it, they can zero out completely or pass to the next in line. 
---
It's not perfect, but I htink it's kind of fair. Thoughts?
---
be real with me, if anyone says raids in the context of vanilla, first thing they think of is MC, bwl, aq
---
You’re objectively wrong
---
5 man groups for druids are cake.  Tank up and profit.  Gearing them is easy too.
---
Druid for sure, especially if your buddy is a lock.  Druid lock is a lotta fun in wpvp.
---
Duh
---
What kind of dream job do you have where all your co workers are functional adults???
---
&gt; They weren't even used until late AQ/Naxx
---
Uh, no. We definitely used ours to finally kill Vael.
---
That AFK Arena game always shows up. Looks like garbage even for a mobile app
---
oh well fuck their feelings :)
---
In today's issue of "Spend your money how ever you want," we have two quotes from people on the classic subreddit.  
---
"It is so awesome they let us login to their game for only $15! I can't believe I am finally going to play the real wow classic for such a small amount!"  
---
"I can't believe the shills that are buying a 48 hr Q&amp;A test from a company for $15.  I will never support BFA by purchasing a wow subscription.  The company should give me a complementary life-time subscription just to even be graced with an elite player like me on their server."
---
&gt;"You have no power here"
---
said WoW Classic but then it turned out work was more powerful than it had seemed. You got fired and didn't have money to stay subscribed which lead to the demise of the WoW Classic curse and return of the more responsible human hidden underneath.

I love classic wow I’ll tell you that 😂 it’s either out in the sun or classic wow; nothing else
---
So the massive link right in my post is too hard for you too find?
---
uh, what? the games movement is basically like diablo or LoL...not runescape or some shit lol. its a fluid ARPG style, not click to move.
---
You are 100% right. A dungeon groyp system where you only found players from your own realm and didn't teleport to the dungeon. An alternative to spamming LFG or Trade Chat. The Classic Community is so against something like that, yet they support a PvP system that is essential Dungeon/Raid findwr from live.
---
It is absurd.
---
What? Who in their right mind would do this? Seems absolutely stupid.
---
You must be a zoomer. It’s an RPG, do you know what the point of an RPG is? It’s not arenas or mythic dungeons
---
I made a few other posts in other threads regarding my experience with ~7 years of being part of and running a loot council, then transitioning to a one man loot council making all the decisions myself, but suffice to say, if you're letting people get away with missing raids and still giving them loot, you're shooting yourself, and your raid in the foot.
---
Attendance followed by performance, every time.  Guy that does 80-90% of your top damages damage but shows up 100% of the time?  He's more useful to you than the guy that tops charts but is flaky and you have no idea if he'll be on week to week.  Its not even a question, and anyone running a loot council playing favorites is just asking for problems anyhow.
---
With a nice 2h weap, 26/25/0 paladin can strike fear into the Horde.  Reck bombs + divine favor heals are no joke.
---
Man I dont know but Legion is my all time favourite (maybe cause I kinda forgot how good game was in pre-cata). Legion PvP wasnt that good but PvE is the best by far. But still if you ask me the perfect WoW would be: Vanilla MMO things, TBC PvP system, Wotlk class design (and maybe add something like mythic+).
---
You replied to every comment in this thread. You fixated on one of the most irrelevant things possible. The definition of autism.
---
you take that back!
---
Oh right, the overwhelming amount of evidence you provide makes that obvious. Because you know what server I played on, and who I played with, and you actually know me too. And you designed the game. And you’re omniscient.
---
well thats just mean,
---
I wreck it Ralph has taught us anything.....
---
Makrik's? I think I have the quest here somewhere, let me see if I can share it.
---
This is our plan. I'm still trying to get the other players to coordinate who takes what profession in what zone so the speed levelers aren't slowed by all the confusion and farting around on launch day. I'd like to know who to trade my cloth and leather to right away, or know if people need me to be the designated tailor.
---
With a small number of people funneling mats efficiently, those wands should be in mass production by level 6 or 7.
---
I don’t get the criticism for RotJ. It was easily my favorite one.
---
He didn't make a thread demanding that something that was in Vanilla be removed for Classic.
---
Quit bitching.
---
Thought I read it somewhere, I was wrong, now I got a troll I can do.
---
10/10 thanks for info
---
If you did, you did it when bwl was not progression content.
---
As is tradition
---
Montage time....CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!
---
It’s my thread you retard.
---
If not being OP is a con and being popular is a con, then it's a moot point as you will always have one of those. My personal opinion is run Druid/Rogue. You need some burst if you are going to do a healing comp as being a Live Lord is pretty useless. Only issue is that you share gear, but you should be resto in PvP anyway. Druid is pretty OP as a flag carrier and you guys can backdoor or stealth hold points in AV/AB. If you are looking at this more for WPvP then definitely Druid/Rogue as stealth is just way too good.
---
Other option I didn't see you kick around is Paladin/Rogue, which would be pretty strong.
---
Oh the thing in the OP
---
yeah I watched that a while back
---
Spoiler alert:  this guy works in Flint Michigan
---
It starts at 2 PM Pacific, 5 PM Eastern.
---
Really, so early on you go surv for the 3% hit?
---
I didnt even say did you search this reddit i mean straight up google search
---
Wrong. BWL was the latest raid out when we stacked World Buffs. We were the second Horde guild to kill Vael.
---
The original wallpaper engine
---
The difference is that account sharing is bannable in retail, and to my understanding is actually enforced, too. If a world first guild (even if it's "just" a Classic world first) account shares their way to victory, there's a good chance it'll raise some GM eyebrows.
---
The evidence is in The podcast you lying twat
---
yeah and dont even get me started on chocolates problems
---
That’s not bitching you dumb ass.
---
The prequels were 1000% not underappreciated. They are garbage. Poorly acted, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly conceived. There are almost no redeeming qualities about them aside from 1 or 2 "cool" scenes and the TV shows they spawned. And a handful of video games based on them. EP1 Racer is 5000x better than the movie.
---
Anyway back to our regularly scheduled discussion. Yeah. Classic is good.
---
Na, given the ability people will always choose to be greedy and ninja loot if they can. especially in a MMO game.
---
&gt;Yoiu realize that Classic TBC isnt a thing yet, how can you say how an entitlement works.
---
Because I have a memory and can remember things that happened previously.
---
Why classic appear, but was not playable.
---
I forget, was being able to become friends with the pirates a thing in vanilla, where you could buy their pirate outfit set?
---
... wenn ich dich seh'
---
Auch wenn ich heut' durch die Hölle geh'🔥
---
Oh shit wrong song 😂
---
How would you plan wand progression for priests? Able to craft lesser magic wand when you get enough linen but should you invest in getting enchanting to 70 for greater magic wand? 
---
Also is it worth doing Bfd or deadlines or other dungeons for the wands?
---
The point of an RPG is whatever you make it.
---
Someone disagrees - must be lying. Maybe I just wasn’t an idiot in vanilla. You should just not play the game when it comes out if the bitching is this strong already.
---
Isn't weapon skill irrelevant in PvP?
---
a hunter weapon
---
always a hunter weapon
---
ninjas ashkandi
---
They better be great, we only had 2 tiers.
---
I had a guild with 4 coworkers at one of my last jobs, but we were all really good friends and still are. Playing wow together probably had a lot to do with it. But we became initial friends from bullshitting to get through the day before that.
---
Im not agreeing or disagreeing with OP but this no changes thing when it comes to this is bullshit. If the devs consider it an exploit (not saying they do), then it should be removed regardless of if it was in vanilla or not. Spell power rogue was in vanilla but no one knew till wotlk and then blizzard fixed it because it was an exploit. Im pretty sure spell power rogue will not be in classic even though it was in vanilla.
---
OP did say if there was a Classic+, not exactly changes to classic as we're getting it.
---
Not with support and stamina gear inner fire and shield.
---
?? It's literally in the canon lore.
---
I can confirm this. I didn't get an invite on my EU account up until today, but after creating a new US starter account,  I got the ability to download and enter the Classic Beta. Still not sure if it will let us enter later today but...
---
Exactly.
---
Ouro drops a good gun
---
I assume you mean raid invites? If dungeons are over-saturated with healers it won't matter if you're a priest or a shaman.
---
Raids need lots of shamans, usually closer to 8 so each group can get some totems. You shouldn't have trouble finding a spot.
---
Just remind everyone that mail isn't instant :)
---
Ever?
---
Good luck proving it.  Next you'll say "well it's pretty obvious is the character is online for 7 days straight", but where is the line?  If you log the account out for 2 hours a day, is it okay then? 4 hours? 6?
---
Then Stfu
---
Better than the nonsense you have put forth

KOS Gnomes !
---
And I was hoping I'd never have to see another panda.
---
it's up to the guild leader to set the loot rules and such from the very beginning. set expectations and recruit like minded people. you want a casual friendly guild and not restrict loot? make sure you lay that out. you want to be hardcore and not lot healers bid on caster dps (if a caster needs it)? then make sure you say that from the get go. 
---
i don't remember it being that bad. we would talk it out. it did slow things down a bit but was manageable.
---
How would you make that work for "pure" dps classes for their specs that underperform for pve/pvp?
---
I feel like you're taking a shot at every single news articles to make it on the front page of reddit
---
well swifty is a nice guy tehre is no doubt about it i realy like him. but he is so bad at pvp considering how much he played the game. and his knowledge about the game is so low
---
It's the difference that for PVP it's a willing sacrifice for the speed of doing PVP. You can go into a raid with 30 people and go raid but you can't get into AV with less than 40. So even if you premade a AV 40man you can't start until the opposing faction found 40 people as well.
---
Far from it
---
&gt;  Layering was always explicitly announced to be continent-wide
---
when was this announced?  what interview are you speaking to?  there was not a blue post I am aware of in the past six months covering this.
---
That is also true 😂
---
I think the AV weekend showed that the historic endless AV match is not enjoyable for everyone, even some people who thought that's what they wanted. I was certainly bored of the whole affair by the end of the weekend, but there were a number of reasons for that, though there were some lengthy matches I enjoyed. 
---
All in all I think there's a number of QOL improvements that happened for bgs that were for the better, and I know not everyone agrees with that. But things like a time limit on wsg, reinforcements forcing an eventual end to AV, being able to queue BGs while out in the world are all improvements that made the experience better, imo.
---
I think perhaps 16 year old me would look at those opinions and say I just want ezmode and call me a nub, but as someone in my 30s now with much less time to dedicate to the game, I can see their merit. 
---
I think perspective matters here too. If I think of the bgs as a means to an end, like a series of chores I have to do before I get to R10, for example, it really doesn't seem appealing. But I think classic is best played with the "it's about the journey, not the destination" mindset. Yes, I'll need to do bgs to rank, but I'll be playing them for the enjoyment of it, primarily, rather than treating it like a sprint. I think in general that's the healthier lens to view Classic through
---
I think the difference between this scene and a lot of the other Jedi/sith vs non force user scenes is that it is so effortless.
---
I am so glad I don't worry about this crap. Adds too much stress when choosing what to play.
---
Upboated
---
You are accusing me of lying when you have literally 0 information about my vanilla experience. Aka, you are being moronic.
---
what's absurd is that you stopped replying to me an hour ago after you realized you didn't have any arguments, and now you're parroting the same thing on other posts. 
---
makes people wonder why you're posting here in the first place when you're not interested in what they have to say
---
I swer if I see this Game of Thrones game ad one more time I'm going to find the guy who coded that algorithm and make him watch the entire last season on repeat for a month.
---
It is, it's also BiS for TBC too. The equip is too powerful
---
The MC part is the very beginning. He even gave timestamps.
---
Get👏A👏Life
---
In this scenario, “wife” is not an issue because she’s apparently not part of the family anyway 😄
---
Nope. BGs will be xrealm though.
---
Feral druids are decent, LotP is great.
---
Alchemy mats for flasks/pots when raids start getting people to 60 and preparing for progression. Arcanite XMute in particular is in very high demand.
---
This post is brought to you by Fear Ward
---
Farming mats is always easier as 60. If you get the opportunity to level them sure. But primaries are hard to level while levelling char at same time. First Aid though.... oof, that is a must have.
---
Objective proof isn’t better? Ok
---
Someone bought the other one, then.
---
&gt;  cannot
---
Yeah they can. They are just humans.
---
Can both undead and troll priest get bros out of CC?
---
So I should be okay with doing dungeon finder but only players on my realm but I can be anywhere to be summoned instantly to the dungeon?
---
Cheetah in a duel is a bad idea. Cheetah in the open world; and BGs however is a great idea. It’s what enables hunters to kite every class except Druids. You honestly think a 5 min sprint cooldown makes a rogue more mobile than a hunter? You think a 3 second cast time on ghost wolf is better? Mages are actually mobile, but a mage can’t outrun a hunter, and as a hunter I’ve kited mages so many times. 
---
You do realize hunters are the best kiting class in the game, and the two reasons for this are 1)best range 2) high mobility. If they didn’t have high mobility they wouldn’t be able to kite so well. Your belief that hunters have no mobility is so wrong.
---
Theres tones of instance portals in classic that never made it. Kevin Jordan was talking on streram last night about how they had 50 instances planned.
---
But this isnt one of those things this was not clearly defined in vanilla, we have known how the maths worked for years and blizzlike pservers were consistant with old in-game debuff priority that I've seen on old forum posts. It would be very odd, imo, for a blizzlike server to break away from this when the info is so easily googleable. This difference also would have been likly pointed out already, we know the major differences now at this point. Ie Parry chance, Damage values, world buff cooldowns, and a few more tid bits. Im in a few discords that are hellbent on finidng every difference between so they can change thier play accordingly, I have not seen anything pointing to this as a difference as of yet. 
---
I was just wondering if there was any proof or at least anything even indicative of this. Assuming pserver values are wrong, is imo, just as bad as assuming they are right. Thinking pragmatically there are going to be things that they got correct/incorrect, I just think that rate is far into it's downward slope at this point as most discrepancies have seamingly been found.
---
Damn the timing, I’m going to the Cubs-Sox game tonight. Why did they pick Wednesday and not any other day? I want to be there right as the shit hits the fan :/
---
there are going to be a ton of funky level 6s in stv doing the arena for the trinket and running to vendors hidden in high level areas with limited supply recipes.
---
You can use a lot of powershifting with the right gear, mana potions and dark runes on CD, it's pretty much the only way to do respectable DPS
---
Rogue.  Join a good guild, you will get gear.
---
You already did mage the first time around.  Do something new.
---
I don’t need it. It’s irrelevant because it’s factually incorrect.
---
Still doesn't outclass Ashjre'thul from Chromaggus, even if you're a Dwarf.
---
People who are defending this whole streamer blacklist spectacle by thinking it'll only affect actual stream snipers are delusional.
---
It's enough that a streamer feels targeted, or has a bad day, gets frustrated, adds the guy to a blacklist, and suddenly someone who has possibly never even heard of this streamer is being shunned by his entire server just for playing the game.
---
A more serious reply says your correct and the none elite mobs found in EPL have a really low chance of 2% to drop the essence.
---
One guy complaining is almost always ignored. If massive portions of the playerbase are complaining, things have a strange way of getting changed.
---
Why not both? ;)
---
Seriously though, rogue is nice for a lot of reasons. You do pretty good pve damage, you'll have fun in pve, you can stealth into areas for quest objectives, you have decent CC, you can pickpocket, there's something fun about sapping someone and never attacking them for the lulz, you can usually get away if you make a mistake and pick on the wrong person, et cetera and so on.
---
Shaman is fun too, but if you don't enjoy pvp healing and you're not a huge fan of lucky procs being your baseline goodness...go rogue.
---
There is no possible way you could have any knowledge of that. If you do, prove it.
---
I assumed PVP because you’re talking about arms. Are you talking more about leveling then?
---
That's the same sort of like PVE. You get a summoning stone (later added) or a warlock to summon spam ya.
---
Good luck playing with the amount of input lag remote desktop sessions have. It's possible but it won't be comfortable and will probably get you killed more than once and be generally less effective.
---
That being said, it *would* be possible to rig something similar to that up by using game streaming solutions like Steam's in-home streaming (which, contrary to its name, can also be ran over the internet with some setup), and the input lag there wouldn't be too terrible. Deploying that for 100 people with good stability would be a technological nightmare though, regardless of how you organize it, so I find it highly unlikely.
---
I understand this reaction, but the highlights, the shadows, the movements and the bublyness of it all makes it feel like that to me.
---
Lol gm intervention. So dumb. People are forgetting that the streamers aren't powerless in game. They could have just as many fanboys protecting them causing *gasp* real world-pvp situations.
---
It went downhill when they started watering down content (Dungeon finder/Raid finder and infinite difficulties in raids/dungeons), Destroying communities and the social aspect of the game (Cross-realm dungeons/raids/party's) just to cater to the most extreme of casual players. 
---
Changing it into a action-MMO instead of the MMORPG that it used to be. The tools that made WoW fall down to its current depths were introduced in late WOTLK, The peak of WoW's existence, slowly eradicating what was left of server communities. Now it's all about collecting the 500th mount, Infinite worthless achievements or the 1500th battle pet all while never interacting with anybody else. People don't talk in dungeon finder, when u need to do a world quest u don't interact with them either u just hop in a group and hop out within 20 seconds of killing the objective. How can it still be an MMO without other people? 
---
Activision allowed blizzard to operate how they always had at the start, before the downfall in late WOTLK, U remember the part where ICC was out for 13 months before new content was released except for that useless filler raid at the end that nobody really bothered with or remembers? That's Activision. Trying to suck all life out of blizzard by lowering costs and increasing profits like a capitalist vampire. Releasing expansions that should never have even been released in their release state like Warlords of Draenor or the shit show that is BFA. My fear is that Activision will choke the first bit of oxygen out of Classic's lungs before its even learned to walk yet, they have a trackrecord of killing babies so we should be aware of it. 
---
The excuse for the WoW-Token's existence of ''Fighting against gold sellers'' Is just another trick to allow them to monetize the game even further without anyone really being able to say much against it. Was gold buying and selling happening in Classic and all previous expansions, obviously it did. But it would be like people are selling coke on the streets so now the police will sell it too to battle against those damn drug dealers. Its ridiculous. 
---
Activision-Blizzard should have never happened and Bobby Kotick is a **cancer** in the purest form who said he literally wants to [Suck the fun out of video games](https://kotaku.com/bobby-kotick-warm-and-fuzzy-defends-notorious-no-fun-5474949)
---
Crossrealm battlegrounds match players with players from other servers. That has a huge impact on the server community. Let's not forget that you originally could not queue from Capital Cities. That was a "QoL" change that Blizzard added because players wanted faster honor. The same reason they capitulated and added crossrealm bgs. So that queue times would be faster.
---
When else would some one use a 2H mace?
---
As long as you understood the point spelling is irrelevant
---
Ok. Keep listening to podcast lol.
---
Only if you mana pot early.
---
I read that you're jealous
---
I'm always amused by people shitting on loot councils as if its universally bad.  I think DKP is garbage, I was under, then part of, then became the sole administrator of a loot council (well, later on more like loot dictator) and no one ever complained about it to the point of raging/leaving.
---
Its almost like no one holds a gun to your head and forces you to continue to raid under a system you disagree with.  I was always very clear with people that I make the sole decision on who gets what loot, and my intent is to gear the raid, not the player.  For example, back in TBC, during BT farming, we saw our first Madness of the Betrayer trinket, and it was hotly contested between rogues, hunters, druids, and warriors.  Well, we only had 1 warrior DPS and he didn't care about loot, and the only person really upset about the situation was our feral tank, but the situation was easily diffused when I asked him "The hunters and rogues DPS on 6 out of 6 fights in Sunwell, how many fights do you DPS on?".  He understood my point, accepted that cat DPS wasn't his primary function within the guild, and eventually we got enough drops that he was able to get his trinket for his offspec anyhow.
---
I don't think I'm interested in being a loot dictator again this time, as I don't put 14+ hours a day into the game anymore (oh the joys of unemployment), but I'd be more than happy to be the voice of reason and logic for a loot council once I start raiding again.
---
First off, sue in court? What are you even arguing me on here, that its a crime? No one is arguing its a crime so... what is your point here?
---
Secondly, that is specifically a SC2 related post and we can all agree the style of griefing in that game is way different than what is possible in WoW. 
---
Thirdly, in that same blue post they state:
---
&gt;We are absolutely able to enforce, and will continue to do so, violations that include harassment of others in-game, use of hacks, abuse of our reporting tools, and attempts to disrupt the gameplay of others.
---
It's pretty obvious that the point of the blue post was about providing players with an in-game advantage. I'm specifically talking about griefing/harassment in game, not about advantages. Two entirely different things, and the blue post that you linked just reinforces the EULA that I first shared...
---
Forget that noise. You can get a wand at level 12 in silverpine iirc
---
I dont know if I remember this right but isnt a male dwarfs joke something like "I like my coffee like I like my women, stout and bitter."?
---
It is stupid easy for hunters to reach the hit cap. And BM is only slightly better DPS than MM before you have any decent gear and since you're not giving 100 AP to your 4 party members, that slightly better DPS boost for yourself is nothing compared to what your raid is missing. And that's if your pet stays alive and can be used at all.
---
&gt; If I'm the tank, I don't want to switch...
---
But the macro doesn't know/care if you're the tank or not and will switch regardless.
---
&gt; Tailoring your macros to make sure you are configured correctly isn't a bad thing.
---
It's not, but having macros that makes you play at an 6/10 instead of the 9/10 you could play at without them, that *is* bad.
---
Orc for the stun resist and attack power cooldown.

I think there is a conversation to be had here. I don't think anyone has properly framed said conversation tho. They don't need to go because they weren't widely used until AQ, that isn't a reason. They actually do nothing but make the really skilled players better. Any casual guild will wipe on trash before the first boss of the raid and lose half of these buffs anyhow. I think the buffs that are earned from raiding should very much so stay. They are a reward to your guild (and anyone else in the area) for completing the content. The DM North and Songflower should, IN MY OPINION, be for world content only. These buffs change the meta, from the hardcore guilds all the way down to the most casual of guilds. The podcast you linked explains that very well. I would prefer to not spend an hour before every raid night getting full buffs. Just my opinion
---
I had est on the brain. &gt;_&lt;
---
You could do a prot warrior with a mage alt. :) Hard to go wrong with being able to get groups easily and being indispensable. And then your alt can charge for portals or water/farm for stuff, which is always nice. :D
---
Hahaha fuck yea dude I remember you and Togy and all of this! Guild leader was Brucal the troll priest. Twitch was an Air Force pilot and that dude was awesome. Gralsh and Ailisha the warlock I met IRL at one point. The repo guy was hilarious I remember he was buying huge sums of eBay gold and he had a hand of rag at one point - his toon name is escaping me as well but I want to say it was Rottenphlegm or something like that. I also remember we had a married couple that both played Druids and they had so much loot drama between them.  the Thunderfury was probably one of the last things I participated in. I wish I could find more of these people again. Hit me up on b.net! Bhell#1125
---
Good guide
---
Y'all can stop wasting your time replying to the OP... the user won't be able to reply for a while.
---
They were viable back then, so why not now? And it isn‘t true that noone knew about them (we did, to some extent), just that hardly anyone cared until the content got a bit harder/overtuned. I say leave them in. If you dislike them so much, don‘t use them. And nobody cares about world firsts in classic...
---
I was thinking boss names. Drakkisath, Mograine, Arugal, Whitemane, Faerlina, Sapphiron, etc.
---
You will get stunned by a cheap shot, hoj, charge or mace proc once on a troll or tauren and regret your decision of the troll race immediatly.
---
If you need 3% less hit, it sure as fuck would.
---
Mop was honestly one of my favorite expacs. Cata and WoD...not so much.
---
I was disc/holy in vanilla and i rolled an alt to farm with.
---
Not saying you cant kill stuff as holy but its VERY slow and frustrating.
---
Yes or you are going to miss and really hurt your dps.  Dont forget to take into account any gear that will help with hit%.
---
what is this, 2012?
---
i like it
---
I'd agree with this. The only issue is getting into groups, but if you're a good hunter and set yourself apart, you won't have any issue.
---
No, not really. Massive complaints can force Blizzard to do their own research, but ultimately they'll decide if they intended it to be that way or not.
---
are there any mage class quests worth doing if you're trying to get to 60 asap?
---
this all makes a lot of sense and now we're back to the drawing board.
---
appreciate it!
---
The amount of people posting about how they have no impulse control is slightly funny to me.
---
What are you talking about. You can easily roll a hybrid class and do two rolls. Warriors perform two rolls spectacularly well in vanilla.
---
You won't find support here. Everything that make the game and progression easier receive a high support from the community...
---
I would like a clear statement on how World buff were working during Vanilla before saying anything else.
---
Don't count out warlock either. Fear alone is going to be super strong that early. Imp is not a bad pet especially when mana is at a premium. Dots do plenty of damage while allowing you to fear and kite.
---
The biggest weakness with classes early is answers, and very few have answers to the shenanigans locks have even at 15.
---
Oh look another private server screenshot to hype people up who completely hate on private servers.
---
I run adguard on top of ublock origin on firefox, can never be too safe, sometimes ads slip threough the cracks
---
Why not Zoidberg?
---
You'll be able to farm DM:E easier than a mage can. Dire Maul is phase 2 I think? Tons of different videos showing how to do it as priest.
---
Ya I agree. They made the game into a giant leech for your wallet. It use to be an actual game.
---
Where?
---
Are you a troll or something? Quit being weird
---
This requires you to talk about pizza online where they can pick up on it. Also google pizza. Also pizza places near you have to take out google ads. They can't show ads that don't exist.
---
&gt; First off, sue in court?
---
You're the one talking about making a legal argument for harassment.
---
&gt;No one is arguing its a crime so... 
---
I said that harassment is a crime.  You said that you could easily make an argument that this was harassment.
---
**YOU LITERALLY SAID YOU COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT STREAM SNIPING WAS A CRIME.**

Ouro doesn’t drop that gun until 1.11, when Naxx opens. We’re most likely getting progressive drop tables.

Here he is talking about the difference between layering and sharding, and talking about "spinning up entire continents" as a "seamless world".

Max - tanks - healers = memespecallowance
---
So what we know from blizzards clarification and beta data is each point from 300-305 is a total of .4% hit for melee I would assume same for ranged but hard to know since iirc ranged can’t be parried... for 2% hit total for the 5 points. However it’s really 3% (kinda) since if you don’t have 305 skill the game is scripted to negate 1% hit from gear/talents. Still not as good as melee since ranged attacks don’t glance and that’s where weapon skill shines for melee.
---
Note that you won’t ever miss 9% of specials but rather only 8% you will just need 9% hit if you don’t have 305 skill.
---
while its likely trolls, we should remember that for 13 of the 15 years of World of warcraft you could play a shaman / paladin on the opposite faction.
---
There's some people who might be legitimately looking forward to Vanilla, not realizing the class split.
---
Druid tanking can certainly work, in fact theyre better at it in 5man content because of the dmg. 
---
In raids you can tank some boss fights (or off tank) but theres no desputing that warriors simply are best tanks when it comes raiding.
---
A feral druid can switch to dps easier though than most other classes because a lot of the talents are the same and they bring a crit buff to other melee's.
---
Biggest weakness is that druids can't get defense stat capped meaning the will take bigger hits than warriors, but usually they make up for that weakness by having a larger healthpool and armor rating.
---
Bro, you have me.
---
Thrall is a Shaman you uncultured swine.
---
I simply hate people using "Cuz".
---
None of the expansions managed to keep me interested longer than a month or two but I did come back to Legion for seconds. Propably played it collectively for 4-5 months. As long as TBC kept my interest honestly.
---
I meant 20 pts in BM, not full BM.
---
I was thinking raiding. Even though it's less good than fury some people might just want to do it anyways especially in a very casual enviroment.
---
Right, and most guilds I've been in at least have a rule against standing in fire.
---
My man, thanks. Such hype now
---
I’d also consider the fact that going ally brings a whole other class with purge spam, which really screws over locks. I’d say it’s worse than pally dispel since you should be downranking dots against pallys and baiting dispel anyway. Being able to disregard shams altogether along with WoTF AND having orc hardiness puts horde substantially above ally for lock in my opinion.
---
Wing clip spam allows for the highest uptime of nightfall. It only works in phase 3 though, once warlocks start doing very good dps and TPS isn't as much of an issue.
---
There is no auto look by default on classic. You have to set a bind for it.
---
No, it really doesn't. Your BIS BWL gear gives 6% hit and the other 3% comes from Biznicks.
---
Do the math yourself: https://classicwow.live/guides/390/hunter-1-12-master-theorycraft-spreadsheet

---
Legion was so much fun, I don't think anyone hated it
---
This attitude is great in theory. Three hours into a run filled with wipes and terrible DPS, it's an awful attitude to have.
---
The vanilla meta was not a game of 1-15% differences between lowest and highest tiers, where taking an "off meta" comp meant only several minutes' difference in the end. A well played "meme spec" was not competitive with an even horribly played viable spec.
---
The vanilla meta was broken down into viable and not viable, where not viable specs pulled less than 50% of what viable specs were pulling in equivalent gear. Sure, a lot of that is based on raids, and in dungeons the numbers are different, but if you think you're going to regularly be able to clear even dungeon content with Shaman tanks, druid/paladin dps, or the other nonsense people post about, good luck. I bet after your first 5-6 hour dungeon run, you'll have changed your mind..
---
Never!
---
&gt; The excuse for the WoW-Token's existence of ''Fighting against gold sellers'' Is just another trick to allow them to monetize the game even further without anyone really being able to say much against it. Was gold buying and selling happening in Classic and all previous expansions, obviously it did. But it would be like people are selling coke on the streets so now the police will sell it too to battle against those damn drug dealers. Its ridiculous.
---
Yeah, cocaine, that is a fine and reasonable example. 
---
A better example would be you go into a store and buy a candy bar (company profits, you profit, everyone is happy) versus you going to a candy bar dealer on the streets where in exchange for your candy costing 10% less there is a 10% chance for the candy bar dealer to run off with your money and leave you with no candy and no money.
---
Take your tinfoil hat off, wait for Classic, and let's all enjoy it for what it is. Guess what? If Blizzard decides to say "FUCK YOU ALL GIMMIE MONIES" you can quit and go back to private servers which will now actually have FAR more information than before about NPC armor values and stat allocations to make their product more complete.
---
You really give Activision far too much credit for being this ominous overlord of death and demise. WoW means virtually nothing to their profit line at this point considering a very significant portion of their profits comes from the mobile games market.
---
gonna do exactly that LW and skin, but gonna take the little extra time to make a lvl 5 alt and park him at org for a bank.
---
Feral Tank in Classic isn't a "real" thing. You can run full bear talents and do really well in P1-P2 since MC itemization isn't great for Warriors and you will have a much stronger Pre Raid BiS going into MC. Most of the time though you should run HotW as it gives your raid a lot of flexibility. You can heal, decurse, or offtank, and it's a really strong build for PvP. 
---
If you ONLY want to tank and do nothing else, go Warrior as it has way more tools and a very strong DPS spec. If you want to maybe Tank, maybe provide utility in Innervate/Bres/Decurse, maybe heal then go Druid as it's extremely flexible.
---
Penisboob
---
Druids cannot use swords confirmed.
---
That's what wowhead says, I couldn't tell you if it's correct though, but I don't think it's "worth" trying to get it that early, the chain involves a decent amount of killing stuff level 12+ and it runs past a lot of other quests on the way which would be a waste to skip since you're there anyway, that's why I don't get it till 13, maybe 14.
---
Oh we didn't have any world firsts. But we got to Naxx before we quit. And it was a blast every step of the way.
---
I cannot wait to see how many of you change your mind once you experience how terrible the specs you're advocating for are...
---
Yeah, priests are the only class that gain special abilities tied to their chosen race. I listened to a dev talk about this and they had plans to do similar abilities with other classes but those never came to fruition and that i probably for the best since Fear Ward in particular is so good that the hardcore guilds/players won't use priests that aren't Dwarfs.
---
Sounds like you over hyped yourself, stop reading spoilers.

I have one that I made but I've never posted.  Waiting for the right moment to collect that karma.

---
Drunk raiding was so much fun!.....from what I remember.
---
Yes there is....
---
I know a bunch of people disagree, but Tauren melee range seems a little broken imo. For PvP, that shit looks clutch. Add in an AoE stun and extra HP? I'm sold. 
---
Additionally, if you do get lucky enough to get TF, none of the Orc racials are useful for PvE. 
---
Orc is still a solid choice though. You'll get first dibs on axes and Hardness is awesome for PvP. 
---
I think Trolls are overrated. Aside from an Orc with an axe, they're the only race to have any extra threat gen but 10sec of +10/30% attack speed with a ~1.9 is only ~0-3 white extra white hits every three minutes. Not exactly gamebreaking and they're definitely lacking in PvP.
---
What about closing threads like these? If the OP is clearly a troll and punished.
---
You could always uninstall the spyware that is causing the problem.
---
Please don’t do that. I know it would feel like you’re helping and doing a service for people, but you’re also giving people a route to completely bypass downloading the episode, and thus I reap no reward or stats from the really hard work that I put into the show. 
---
It’s truly not that much different from piracy of copyrighted content. All you’re doing is giving people an avenue to read it in 20 minutes, rather than spending 30 minutes listening to it on double speed, which is an option on many podcast platforms. 
---
I realise some people out there may be hearing impaired, and it’s great that there are easy and cheap transcription services out there for them, but when going up just for the purposes of general consumption, this is not on. I hope you understand where I’m coming from, cheers.
---
I killed a Multiboxer with 10 droods in retail with my mage, this was a fiesta, but yes one Player just cant play so much chars effectively
---
Not really. Once ZG is open you have more hit than you know what to do with. 
---
* 2% from ZG enchants, 1% from neck (ony head neck or nef drop neck)
---
* 1% from rings
---
* 2-3% from tier gear depending on whether you’re running T2 (2%) or T3 (3%). 
---
The only thing dwarf/troll racials do is allow you to switch the costly 3% hit scope for a cheap +7 dmg scope.
---
It definitely got better as it went on. The ap and ak grind became less a pain as time went on, we went from a legendary every 2 months to 1 a week as well as getting resources to purchase them and ways for us to get boa ones for alts and they also worked hard at balancing them so you weren't completely fucked if you didn't get your bis.
---
I find legion weird because it's like the opposite of cata for me where in cata I loved the launch but disliked it more as time went on while legions mechanics felt crap at launch but got far less tedious at time went on.
---
You know what you're right. IDK how I missed that.
---
All the time? If it’s an upgrade why would they take it off?
---
Yep, doing the same thing on Classic release.  So we should have a pretty smooth release.  You'll have your shard A, B, C, etc and they're prioritizing putting guilds on the same shard fragments of a server.  
---
Ideally, they said they want to eliminate it after a few weeks and get everyone on the same server, but it will be adjusted as server demands rise/fall.
---
You can only use the pickpocket macro with openers from stealth

---
MC is not a 40 man raid, it's a 20 man raid with 40 slots.
---
Gold is more valuable in Classic. Even with a reduced market and more effort required, it will be very much worth it to sell raid gear.
---
There will be people that go to shady sites and buy gold like they always have for sure. But for Blizzard to normalize this behavior is even worse and its just an excuse to grab some extra cash from the game while saying 'If we wouldn't do it someone else would' Its bullshit.
---
They’re not, as far as I know, as we’re not affiliated in anyway. And please read my response above re: transcription.
---
i hate legion and bfa equally
---
Dude makes post stating what his opinion is, AND what he plans on doing.
---
People still tell him exactly what they say he is going to do.
---
I do not get the logic here. Or maybe more I can't conceive of the complete lack of it.
---
30 seconds is even enough
---
id say that its worth it as a NE priest, find 1-2 other NE priests and quickly run the quest
---
priest leveling is so much faster with a wand early on, locks also benefit a lot
---
You are at a Cubs-Sox game.....the shit is always hitting the fan
---
Elves are the tallest AF race, by like 6 inches over the humans.
---
Tauren are the tallest Horde race, by like a foot and a half over the Trolls.
---
I guess you never raided with DPS warriors. They actually chase fires to get rage for "mad deeps".
---
I'll be honest, I really disliked 90% of the revamped zones. It really just made everywhere feel super linear, I felt like a child being led by my hand the entire time, it was not fun. That is why I think that Cata was really the biggest sign of the beginning of the decline of WoW for me.
---
Maybe you’ll be able to play but have the same restrictions otherwise in place for retail. No mail, no ah, no trading. Can’t message people unless they are “friends”.
---
I’m specifically talking about meme specs that all these newcomers are trying to shove down people’s throats &amp; attempting to get Blizzard to add items or tweak talents. I’m sorry but Ret Paladin isn’t taken seriously. Balance Druid and Enhance Shaman don’t DPS well. 
---
You can theory craft and day dream all you want. Vanilla is Vanilla. These specs were buffed in TBC. Wait till those legacy servers are released and pick a viable spec.
---
&gt; play what you want when you want is not vanilla design, that's retail design 
---
This did not answer my question. Classic was not "good" because it intentionally stopped you from doing what you wanted to do. Classic was good because it had so many fun options that all took their time and were still interesting. You said that an artificial factor that stops people from doing what they want is positive - or rather implied so. And that's not "vanilla", that's just a bad argument.
---
&gt;if bgs are popular enough for instant queues, you'd get instant queues without xrealm
---
This is wrong. Instant queues need popular BGs and a perfect faction balance - this is simply not happening. That's the entire point of xrealm BGs. Many servers had 1h+ queues for PvP. And sorry, there's no arguing about the fact that this completely kills BGs for said faction. Non-xrealm BGs are basically no BGs for these people. I know it, I've played tons of back then and at one time we even rerolled on another server, just to face the issue of these long queues. Should've informed ourselves before :/
---
Your post is right though, in a general sense it is hypocritical. People accept it because a) it was in vanilla, even if only half a year, and b) because PvP and PvE are kinda different. 
---
In PvE you are quite dependent on your teammates. You're all in the same place trying to do a dungeon/raid. There's only the goal to clear it and everyone else directly affects you. Every pull, every stupid taunt and everything else they can mess up - while being able to steal your loot.
---
In PvP you don't see the majority of players anyway. People are spread out, attacking, defending, farming kills at the spawn or doing other things. BGs are big. And losing a BG can not easily be attributed to a single bad player, because losing is part of PvP, as it means the other faction is winning.
---
Now don't get me wrong, I can deal with non xrealm BGs on a balanced server, but there's no way that this is happening (the balance aspect).
---
Pretty sure the best farming spot is the critters in Orgrimmar.
---
Really explain Cata, WoD and BFA then.....
---
I like BGs more than the random world pvp.  I wish they bring in BGs, with out rep or rewards, on release to play some while leveling for a break in monotany.
---
It's called MoP but yes I had a blast as a pvper. I think if you ask people who played that expansion, many if not most will tell you their class was fun to play. Every high rated pvp streamer I heard talk about MoP spoke fondly of it. Lots of fun abilities and each spec felt unique.
---
Some of my favorite pvp videos come from MoP, like [Cobrak 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivk-7QZBus&amp;t=134s) or [Hansol 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MThFyrvzsFQ). That's a pvp perspective though, maybe for pve it wasn't as good? Not sure. Anyone who pve'd in MoP can chime in? Was pve bad? Raid design? Content drought?
---
I feel like the most common complaint of MoP is "kung fu pandas" but I've never found that decent criticism of the game. The daily quest grind is better criticism, but it's not like I didn't grind rep in TBC/Wotlk and I loved those expansions too. Also one of those rep grinds is still useful years after mop, my trusty waterstrider.
---
meant other interviews, not your. and I read it, dw : ) I was just replying to the dude above
---
You didnt really say why you were leaning druid other than that you have a friend who wants to play lock, but what about a shaman (if horde)? Very versatile, highly sought after, very high value to 5man and PvP with totem buffs, a couple of different specs to play with too.
---
Oh interesting. Does it work with backstab?
---
Complete opposite. There are more people that complained about the end of WotLK, all of Cata, all of MoP, all of WoD, all of Legion, and all of BFA than there are that didn't.
---
Resto Druid is most definitely overpowered in PvP. Especially when you partner with a Rogue. If you played arena in TBC, then you shouldn't need anyone to explain that to you. The "Druids are bad" stuff in Vanilla comes from PvE. They're actually very good in PvE, but HoTs don't stack (only one Regrowth + Rejuv per target) so you can only bring 1 or *maybe* 2 healing Druids in a 40-man raid.
---
As for races: Alliance is objectively the better faction in Vanilla. If you do go the Rogue/Druid route, then Horde is an option. Shaman hard counter Druids and match up very well against Rogues but you don't have to fight Shaman if you're Horde.
---
Put the transcript on your website if you want to make money from it, but that's not going to stop the community from helping our less fortunate if you don't want to.
---
Retail classic or pserver?
---
I think people don't really realize that the sole act of kicking and replacing a party member can take upwards of twenty minutes to half an hour (or even more) between actually finding someone to join up, then waiting for them to run to the dungeon if you don't have a summon, then potentially clearing respawns, then running back to where you were...
---
Like, this isn't retail where it's a two-click three minute process.

vanilla disc/holy priest here, i would recommend you roll an alt for farming gold and mats, it simply takes too long farming on a heal specced priest.
---
My experience healing raids back then was that it was very easy as a priest to do your job. You have the best healing spells available, hots, fast heals, slow big heals, group heals and shields. 
---
I enjoyed the time as a healer, it always felt good keeping the raid alive and being a priest im certain opened a lot of doors to content i wouldnt have experienced probably as just another dps.
---
hahahaha what? TFA is nowhere near "well recieved", both sequel movies have been controversial

The dude FLAT OUT SAID he doesn't care.
---
If someone says "I take anyone, play how you want" and a fucking tryhard decides to be there, either he doesn't care or has a freaking brain tumor because he put himself in a situation he knew was going to end up that way. 
---
And no, you aren't doing a server by being tryhard, putting yourself in a casual raid, then forcing them to change their ways because you deemed them inferior.
---
Without having much private server experience I am really surprised by a couple of things:
---
\- More Shamans/Paladins than Priests
---
\- Warlock being 3rd overall on Horde side even before Mages
---
\- Rogues and in particular Hunters being so low (Hunter's probably driven by the general idea they do bad damage in later raid tiers)
---
There absolutely was in Vanilla.  Wowwiki thinks it arrived with patch 1.9, but I distinctly remember enabling autoloot and using SHIFT for when I didn't want to autoloot.
---
I guess for some one worried enough about min/maxing to pick a race based on weapon availability, I don't really see any reason why they'd ever use a 2H mace in PvE content.

I’ve solidified my resolve to dual box warrior and disc priest. As a priest, me and 4 other people could turn around a losing AV. I had a lot of fun with that.
---
yeah what this guy said \^
---
On of them was El Pollo Grande!  You could ride a giant chicken!  It's amazing.
---
You won't see much of a difference between them.
---
The non viable raiding specs won't become viable...
---
I wasn't around for Legion untl the very end, right before BFA released, so I can't really say anything about its peak. But, what I can say is that when leveling characters Legion is where things get irritating. I don't like the quests or the terrain. if I could skip Legion I would...
---
the issue is that its a boring topic that we will get to in the future, let things play out, the game isnt even out and people are making posts every 20 minutes on here about post naxx content when the same people probably wont even clear naxx, just let the game exist as it was. or go to the wow plus subreddit.
---
Your “fun” playing sub par specs is at the detriment of the other 39 players. No Raid Finder here. Good luck.
---
ya mon
---
I personally don’t even bother microwaving it most of the time and just eat it cold which is even more delicious
---
100%.  You could also make one of the hunters use it instead of a pally :)
---
When I stopped thinking of my druid as a watered down rogue/warrior/priest and embraced it as a hybrid it went from bad to enjoyable very quick. 
---
Originally I was disappointed I couldn't kill or heal as efficiently. But then you realize you have other, more *unique* perks: maneuverability, survivability, excellent escape options, and of course the ability to support your team in almost any way imaginable. And overall I loved the way I had to analyse each battle, trying to figure out the best way to adapt while expending as little mana as possible.
---
The class being above average or below average does not matter in the hands of good players. You are looking at it class by class. Class does not matter when someone better is playing against someone not good. A good player will play their class well, an average player will not.
---
I appreciate the push haha. Doesnt sound shallow to me. 
---
I should clarify that i prefer undead casting animations but am totally fine with orcs. More meant that most cloth gear doesnt look good on an orc, and they're pretty big and bulky for the dreadsteed mount. Not too worried about the epic mount as that's a little bigger and i can ride an epic wolf or something in the meantime. 
---
Also factoring into the situation is that ive played undead in retail since 2012 so a change of pace to orc wouldnt be the worst thing in the world
---
It also bulldozed so much lore. New players simply weren't playing the same game everyone else played through.
---
Pallys have no ranged pull, no taunt, and their talent that improves block chance only procs on crits, which for raiding if you've maxed defensive skill will never happen. So they end up hanging out in the shadow of warriors. Which is fine. Geared, skilled paladins can still tank 5 mans.
---
To clarify, the requirement is **stealth**.  You have to be in stealth to pickpocket.  I mean it says it right on the tooltip.  You can put it with anything and try it, provided you are actually in stealth.
---
No there isn’t. There is a setting. It is not on by default.
---
Yup! That was the root of what I was getting at when I mentioned they could randomly target anyone and claim stream sniping, and then become "blacklisted" in the community.
---
That was not a meme spec. Feral tanks were definitely meta tank pics for certain encounters.
---
&gt; I was hoping to be able to transfer my wtf files and addons from a previous pserver
---
I'm pretty sure that won't work, seeing as the addons would have to be format compatible with the 8.X code branch. And I'm entirely uncertain about the format of WTF data between 1.12 and the 8.x client.
---
Smite priest with a ret paladin for sanctity and judging crusader
---
He's just mad because his mom made him go to bed early
---
These comments jeeze.
---
Let's remember something rather important - the "META" or "VIABLE" specs took a very long time to sort out. Information was very limited, and scarcely shared among people through forums typically. As such there were tons of meme specs out there for the longest time, as nobody knew what in the hell we were doing.
---
Next off, nobody can inspect your talents, so unless you're completely obvious (like a moonkin, or a shadowpriest), it's rather difficult to tell if you're perfectly specced, or you just are undergeared/just SUCK.
---
Personally IDGAF if the group's DPS isn't insane, bosses don't have enrage timers in dungeons. Going oom as a healer is very difficult if you are playing well, and have even okay gear. (Hell it is difficult to oom a FERAL druid who is healing unless you're taking 20 minutes)
---
The dungeons in classic, AREN'T OVERLY DIFFICULT in comparison to now. Even raid mechanics aren't insane.
---
The only dungeons that are going to take a while to clear, are places like BRD (it's really REALLY long no matter what tryhard group you have), Scholo (same deal, it's LONG) and Strat live.
---
Wiping usually happens not because you lack DPS, but because you pull extra, or aren't using CC. AOEing everything down isn't the answer to every pull. Using CC is almost always, the best bet.
---
its a horse ahead of the cart issue
---
Or are joking, as would be a billion times more likely on a forum dedicated to classic wow... Come on now
---
Is the Classic community so fucking toxic that they fully plan on implementing blacklists based entirely on half ass researched "meme specs" ?
---

&gt; ve times a day, literally. We don't need to worry about it now, we've got five or six phases of Classic to play through
---
I sort by new frequently and haven't really seen my exact questions brought up.  Sorry if it has been, I am just genuinely curious why people want the game to die instead of forking off onto a different path from retail and that being potentially incredible for us.
---
You don’t choose what items drop for you dude. You use what you can get. This is a pretty much free item so planning around gear you will 100% get makes sense.
---
This is so off it's not even funny.
---
Cata and MoP are underappreciated. WoD... not so much.
---
Though there are still people who claim WoD is worse than BfA, which makes no sense to me. WoD didn't have Titanforging and the class design was decent, so it wins by default.
---
MS/40 should be no higher than 2.5.... Your first shadowpriest counts as 0.5, but every one after that is worth 1.
---
Prot Pally is 1.5
---
Boomchicken is 1
---
Disc Priest is 0.5
---
Ele Shaman is 1
---
Enh Shaman is 1
---
Ret pally is 1.5
---
Feral Tank is 0.25 ONLY if warriors are fewer than 7, otherwise feral tank is a full .75
---
Feral DPS is 1

Blizzard has no intention of developing new content for Classic. Their goal is to convert Classic players that refuse to play current Retail over to a new Retail. That's it. That's where all the money is and every other business decision under the sun. And they've shown their hand by planning a level squish in the new expansion back to 60.
---
Classic won't get TBC in 2 years. The expansion 2 years out will have enough compromises and enough of a hard reset to convert enough Classic players over. It won't be Retail, it won't be Classic, it'll just be World of Warcraft. And then they'll slowly start shutting Classic down until your only choice is to transfer your character over to the new game and see if all the Classic veterans are right that the new WoW isn't what we hated.
---
But all the movies after the first three suck ass, like its not even up for debate...
---
sounds stressfull
---
I replied to you above but to make things clear: I want to make sure you know I have no plans to do any transcription, unless you as the author, would want it. I completely understand what you are coming from. Let me know if you would need any help, otherwise keep up the good work : )       
---
and I'm sure the user above agrees and just meant it well!    
---
one more thing: by transcription I meant pitching 10 or something points from the podcast, not word by word. sorry if I was confusing!
---
Undead Warlock is ALSO featured in the Burning Crusade cinematic too.
---
Black Morass hellfire murloc burnination FTW.
---
Games is not even out yet... fuck that. People who need contant new content every 3 months and adrenaline shots from cassino like loot while playing games can go to retail.
---
Do it until you get banned
---
As well, Org is home of Warchiefs Blessing, or whatever that buff is called.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor!
---
Yeah I should have clarified, I'm trying from stealth and it doesn't work. I'll make an edit to my post.

Noggenfogger
---
The holy texts of blue come up nil. Zug zug
---
Half the raids do not have enrage timers in classic.
---
Twitch numbers are down as well. Everyone's already getting tired of watching streamers play.
---
Holy Paladins best single target, Holy best AOE and overall healers.
---
I personally never cared that much about PvP balance, just as long as it was fun.
---
There’s plenty of good to say about classic
---
Those would be because blizzard listened to the loudest people and changed stuff for them.
---
Unfortunately instance resets don't work according to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bt6fac/instance_farming_and_camp/) unless you're outside of the instance. There's a possible workaround in the thread as well but no confirmation that it's been tested on the beta.
---
&gt; Underappreciated in their time
---
I know the /u/prequelmemes police will come for me for saying this, but the prequels were really bad.
---
I do not understand this at all.  Why not just quit playing when new content comes out and let others continue playing?
---
I've noticed that every speed leveler picks up their quests and starts running to mobs then starts messing with their UI while running in the background.  
---
I can't believe none of them have thought to make a macro that sets everything as desired.  
---
That's what I plan to work on.
---
Even the leveling experience forces you to want to pay to skip it lol
---
1) Windfury
---
2) Frost Shock
---
A hunter can kite every class except Druid. How is that not practical? How do you expect to daze a hunter when they outrange you and most likely run faster than you?
---
I normally would agree, but if you get Wed-Fri off that week, you get 6 days off (in the US, at least). I doubt it’ll be a broken mess the entire 6 days I have off.
---
Not every situation is created equal. I agree they aren't powerless, and they should use any in-game means necessary to prevent it - stream on delay, call for the guild, call for randoms to help, move to a new zone. But I do think they should be given a fairly reasonable expectation to play the game without excessive griefing, and by that I mean constantly camped for hours and hours of gameplay time.
---
I could see anyone playing vanilla wow.  Younger people sometimes like things older people like.  Some of them like fortnite or whatever but not every young person is the same.
---
While mage is one of the more overplayed/popular classes, there is good reason for it.
---
-  PVE: Always wanted and generally easy to gear
---
-  PVP: Never really bored playing a mage in pvp: always nice to have r1 frostbolt to help melee clear distance or save caster from getting pummeled.
---
-  Utility: Vending Machine that can Teleport
---
You're thinking of Noggenfogger's Elixir. It was an unlockable consumable after a chain quest in Tanaris (Gadgetzan). It transformed your character into a Skeleton which has the same animations as an Undead.
---
Many of the world's first raiders way back when clicked their abilities. Private servers are tuned harder than classic will be and people progression raid with meme specs. People will be fine if they put some effort into their characters.
---
&gt; would some of you rather quit playing out of boredom rather than giving them a chance to make acceptable content 
---
Bitch im still playing Diablo 2.
---
Noggenfogger Elixir in Gadgetzan. I think Orb of Deception for gnome was tauren.
---
I'm not saying to release new content in 3 months.
---
This was years ago on a pserver. Also what was BiS back then has changed compared to now. A lot.
---
&gt; We've seen a bunch of these polls by now and the results are consistent.
---
They're also consistently way off from any vanilla server that has ever actually existed, retail or private. Polls are misleading--people will vote for what they want to see, not necessarily what they'll end up picking. They see 49/51 H/A and pick horde just to get it closer to 50/50. They're nervous about mage being overpopulated so they don't vote for it, just so it doesn't look as bad. Things like that.
---
I can guarantee that there's absolutely no way shaman and warlock will be the 2nd and 3rd most popular on horde. There's also very little chance of a 50/50 faction split overall, that usually doesn't even happen on private servers where there's only one realm and you can see the exact faction balance at all times. In Classic, almost everyone will pick whatever their friends or guild happen to pick.
---
I always shake my head a little when people take these polls super seriously. It's like going to an indue music festival to poll people's favorite directors and then expecting the answers to apply to the whole population. If you go to Walmart and ask the same question, you'll get way different answers, but a poll on this subreddit will not reflect reality. This is a community that's *desperate* for everything to be as perfect as possible, so they'll vote towards faction balance and class equality even though most won't pick what they voted for.
---
No, he wrote rogue, not hunter. ;P
---
A lot of people say TBC questing hasn't aged well, but honestly I think it holds up really well. I like that more free-form questing style, instead of the hold-your-hand linear stuff that Cata introduced.
---
STV and Darkshire yo
---
&gt; edit: lots of hate but nobody disagrees with me.
---
Delicious data. Thank you for this. Stoked on how rogues are a lil less popular than I remember. I'll be rolling anyway but it would be great to not have them completely litter the server
---
Hey legit strat on Shazzrah.
---
There’s definitely plenty of great places online that are pretty cheap for transcription, and I do recommend them if it’s for personal use, which I’m totally cool with, as you still have to download the episode to do that. It’s just the sharing of it that bothers me. Thanks for understanding.
---
Not true at all. There were people complaining all through cata about how hard the content was. There were also tons of people complaining about not being able to get into end game content so they introduced LFR
---
Many of us have no interest in listening to someone's podcast.  I will not, nor will I ever, listen to your podcast as things are currently.  I don't think I'm unique.
---
If you had a transcript, or cut out small chunks of particularly interesting material, I would be willing to read or listen to that.
---
How p2w is it? Is pvp balanced? Is pve balanced? Is there a holy class trinity?
---
Yeah, I think it's fun to beat the garbage out of someone with WF crits but they're not dependable at all and I feel like the amount of time it fails vs. succeeds would end up feeling underwhelming overall. Still fun, but not as much fun. Rogue lets you sneaky sneak around and have fun regularly and when you're in the mood to deal with WF's nonsense, you can flip over to your alt and have fun there too! :D
---
August can't get here fast enough!
---
This meme is already in effect to peopel with BETA-access.
---
&gt; BRF is one of the best raids in the entire game. What was really dumb with WoD was getting more gear from your garrison missions than you would actually raiding.
---
Have you actually played the expansion or are you just spamming the same stupid thing every1 else does? You literally had ONE mission every week that gave you ONE random piece from the current raid difficulty you were raiding. The loot table was the entire instance. It was unpredictable and hardly an upgrade most of the time ...
---
WoD had flaws, but this is just a blatant lie ...
---
Bring on the Shaman Tanks!  haha
---
I don't think files from pservers will translate at all to Classic since Classic uses the modern 8.x client, UI, and settings (albeit with a few settings removed to make it similar to Vanilla options).
---
Thanks for the detailed advice! May I ask what poisons you are usually using? I'm assuming in Vanilla its Crippling MH and Instant OH (mind-numbing OH vs. casters)?
---
Bump for sim question
---
I know about noggenflogger. It's not noggenflogger. Like my character in game was ALWAYS looking undead. Its only on my screen though, to other players I looked like a gnome.
---
Hardly the vast majority of players said prelaunch these xpacs sucked yet Blizz continued. Your opinion means shit to Blizzard, stop deluding yourself.
---
If you want to endgame raid with people whose idea of fun is completing raids in a timely manner with as little material cost as possible, don't be surprised when they want things a certain way. 
---
Otherwise, do you.
---
I don't know about that, rumor is they were experimenting with merging factions, or allow cross faction play.
---
And they made it clear they will never allow classic content to hit the live servers... etc
---
You realize those specs can meet dps requirements up to at least BWL right?
---
if they release anything past classic itll be TBC, thats the end of it, and thats assuming they even do that. theyre not going to develop 2 mmos, they have already said this.
---
You're not doing this as a charity - you're doing it for money.  The fact that you're here going to great pains to make sure you get your monetary compensation proves that.  So you can't have it both ways.
---
I’ve seen people run to nelf starting zone as gnome/dwarf. At what point in darnassus/darkshore can I pick quests as gnome/dwarf lvl 1?
---
And the op brought up none of them and just trashtalked bfa.
---
"X is better in classic rather than retail" is fine, "retail bad huhu" isn't.
---
:'(
---
That’s perfectly fine. Podcasts aren’t for everyone. Particularly ones of this length. But transcripts won’t be coming.
---
How are halfway decent warriors, who are basically immune to fear with an interrupt once every few seconds, going to die to dots before they kill a clothie with no mobility? 
---
Either you run succubus and give yourself space before you dot them, or you run voidwalker for some extra survivability. Either way you're a dead duck after it wears off.
---
Hunters are less of a problem, but still hard to beat unless you have every single cooldown and some good rng.
---
Rogues are a fairer fight, but they're fucking obnoxious in BGs with all the stuns, interrupts, and pushback from frequent melees.
---
&gt; And I make no money from my website. 
---
Then why do you care if we read a transcript?
---
I think Onsalught-wow's Loot List system is 100% better. But DKP is better for casual teams morale. I mean, I left high school 20 years ago,  and don't have time to establish lunch room cliques with randos on the internet to convince them to give me gear on a loot counsel model.  Loot lists and Counsel cause favoritism drama, dkp is obvious.  You have the points or you don't.  Causal Part timer like me? You get gear part time. Suck it up.
---
Joana's record is a no-help run.
---
With assistance from a coordinated guild you can cut it down a bit further, even as a slower class.
---
Only MT really needs gear close to BiS.
---
I expect it to be done, not by many, but pserver neckbeards and retail people like Method will be more than up to the challenge.
---
They wear cloth, but they can use inspire (or whatever it's called) for increased armour. They also have access to a wide range of talents that increase armour and restore health passively. They're certainly not tanking forever like a paladin, but they can survive long enough for their friends to arrive.
---
Imo lots of normie edgelords will play rogue. Dont forget that this subreddit is like 1-5% of the classic wow community. Rogues and hunters will be much much higher on live. Those are the two popular fantasy classes people like to play.
---
My experience cannot confirm that. A BM hunter requires little to no  skill at all, yet you need an above average mage to actually beat him. The opposite is true as well. An amazing warrior stands to chance against a good frost mage.
---
It was an addon, you probably got it from curse
---
Mc is a joke. Being good enough to clear it doesn't mean anything...
---
You can install it on Firefox on your android.
---
Said the same below. Whining and stamping his foot 🙄
---
&gt; each point from 300-305 is a total of .4% hit for melee
---
Not quite, it's 0.2% hit for each skill level between 300 and 305. The formula changes at 305, which makes the miss chance jump from 7.2% (hitcap is 8.2%) @304 to 6% @305.
---
[Here]'s a neat table with the formula currently used as well as test results from the Beta.
---
That's a great analogy
---
There used to be "mods" which were downloadable edits that would actually edit certain aspects of display values, in your case a model ID. Druids had one that would make them a Panda-bear instead of the regular bear, and other display altering mods. These affected your client only, and no one else could see this (as only your local files were affected, nothing server side).
---
As far I know, these do not work on the current client, and will not work in Classic. **I am in no way a tech-savvy individual, and this is all based on general knowledge. I don't know jack about how this stuff actually works**
---
Ya that’s why I think rogue, just feels like a more fun overall experience
---
Good for you! Hope we all enjoy classic as much as we think we will!
---
Well, I love playing a healing priest for dungeons and endgame but I hate levelling one (casting combat). I love levelling a warrior (melee combat), but I don't know if maintanking will be my thing... help me...
---
Yes. It's against tos to change game files. Some people would change models to be small and get to places they shouldn't be.
---
you're a big meanie head
---
Really, because all the elitists insist THEY are the majority.
---
Its not about trust, it's about less work for the loot council. They only have to care about a limited set of items vs dealing with all of them.
---
k
---
And? Why does it bother you so much to help those less fortunate than you experience your content?
---
Makes sense. That makes it hard. Personally I really like undead animations but can't stand the hunching and bones sticking out of clothes, so I'd roll orc over them anyday. 
---
I see what you mean, though; a little change could make the experience feel fresh!
---
Yes there are Classic addons on Twitch/Curse. Just make sure to sort by Classic under Game Version.
---
You do know how easy it is for people to see you’re just a troll account?
---
Like you made a post defending Trollgodx and you think people will actually fall for your trolling ?
---
&gt;  and you’ll get support from people who want to take short cuts as well.
---
I don't understand this angle you keep trying to push.  If you want to put out a 20-page transcript, I'll read every word of it.  But I don't care to listen to someone talk for two hours.  It's not about short-cuts - it's about preferred mediums.  I don't want to sit at my desk for two hours with an earbud in my ear because some elitist on the internet thinks its the only proper way to experience his content.
---
Your attitude here sucks.  I was indifferent to you, but now you're making me actively hate you and your content.
---
I originally leveled a warrior in vanilla to 60.
---
For Classic I am torn between these 3:
---
Human warrior, bit of min/max to me the weapon skills are too good to pass up. I like warrior tanking (tanking in general) and like warriors. Always a melee player in pretty much every rpg/mmorpg I’ve done.
---
Dorf/human rogue; race doesn’t matter as much to me for this one (talents for rogues give weapon skill). My playing partner likes dwarfs the most and would want me to play that or human. Like the rogue play style, after my warrior in vanilla I pretty much mained rogue until monks hit with MoP. Love the rogue class fantasy and am down with any playstyle. Only con is I won’t be able to tank, so group content (which I love dungeon running) will take longer to form. Pro is solo stealth runs, which I always enjoy and like to challenge myself seeing what bosses I can do and when.
---
Last but not least, NElf Druid. Don’t mind healing and won’t mind healing at max. Would much prefer feral but don’t know that I have the time to sink into making it work every week (MCP farm). While leveling I can tank but also do solo stealth runs. However literally jack of all master of none. Don’t quite get the rogue or warrior class fantasy and won’t for sure be melee (really love playing melee) the whole time.
---
Help me decide reddit.
---
I found out late Vanilla how much better trade chat created PvP groups are than just going solo. 
---
A good way make friends of you don't suck.
---
I hope if they ever do tbc servers they at least have it then. I want me rocket mount man.
---
How are you going to do that with Master Looter on bud?
---
Or are you pugging 39 other people for Onyxia just so you can do it once and roll a new character after getting blacklisted?
---
As soon as people learn pulling, CCing and threat. First few weeks of 5 mans will be a headache.
---
I love being in a 5 man with 3 locks as dps. LOOOOVE IT.
---

---
Shh don't break their dreams of accomplishing the goal of top speedrunning raiders like someone actually cares.
---
I dont care about 0 healers i care about being matched agaisnt premades and then another premade and then another and another for 2 hours. 
---
I just want a premade vs premade matchmaking and leave the pugs vs pugs alone
---
&gt; A hunter can kite every class except Druid.
---
That's just not true. Just about every class has a way to close the gap and daze them.
---
&gt;How do you expect to daze a hunter when they outrange you
---
Because world pvp rarely if ever starts at 40 yards.
---
Firelands my dude
---
So you cleared aq 40 with a bunch of meme specs? What exactly did you bring?
---
Hey man, fuck the downvoters, it's a good post.
---
Firstly, I applaud you for actually arguing with actual counter points. It's very rare around here.
---
I dont think impulsive behavior has anything to do with LFG. You can argue that it makes the game less social but saying its catered to impulsive behavior is really reaching. There was a dungeon finder in early vanilla at meeting stones that no one used. Highly doubt they were trying to exploit you.
---
Now to address the only actual point you made which is to do with balancing. We did see something like this at the launch of BFA with warmode. Alliance wasn't doing so hot in WPvP and people started to turn it off which lead to Alliance losing even more which lead to more people turning it off and it snowballed to a point where there were only a handful of alliance left in warmode. I agree, this is a thing that will happen but I think we should start without cross realm BG and then implement it to servers with very unbalanced factions. Consider this. Classic servers will launch with much higher player caps than vanilla did. They stated one layer in classic will hold as many people as a whole server used to. There should be a much higher player pool to draw from in classic servers than the old vanilla servers had. I played Horde on a server where Alliance was outnumbered 2:3 and I never really felt like I had really long queue times or that one side was continuously winning in BGs. Just look through realmpop.com and I see about 1/3 of the servers you can consider pretty balanced in A:H ratio. Healthy server only pvp communities are possible and I dont think it's fair to not give them a chance to try it.
---
It sucked then and it's going to suck now. Grinding AB and AV reputations are hell, especialy AB. 
---
If you're planning on grinding AB reputation I strongly suggest going all in on PvP and finding yourself a premade just for the sake of your sanity. I did AB exalted almost exclusively on PUGs and up until revered it was somehow manageable but then doing 10 ABs and seeing your rep at like 1k/21 because PUGs are shit and sometimes you lose 5 or more in a row is just too stresful.
---
the more you play lol the more likely you will buy lol things
---
Thats just how classic is man. You have to think about what abilities you use instead of spamming your dps rotation. Its slower paced combat. Rogues are in no way bad in classic. Its why I decided I'm going to roll orc, because of all the stuns.

---
Excuse me, did we play the same Vanilla WoW?
---
They were allowed in raid groups all the time. No one micromanaged classes back then other than the guilds clearing Naxx. And if you did play back then, you would know what % of the population THAT was.
---
Because then you do not listen to the podcast.
---
Im stupid, i didnt think of that :D might be a bit of a surprise when they hit the charaacter creation screen :D
---
Blood Craze has kept me alive more times than I can count. It's also good in PVE for reducing downtime spent healing.
---
Just to be clear, before I give one final reply to this, when you keep saying the ‘less fortunate’, do you mean hearing impaired people?
---
You want a director's cut of all the bad shit that was cut for qualitys sake...you cant polish a turd.
---
Crypts of Karazhan is a bad raid. Azshara crater is a bad BG
---
You're kidding yourself if you don't think Priest will be top 3. Its "the healer" in classic.
---
You realise you post this as self promotion to reddit and then complain if people try to make it more accessible.
---
You are using reddit huge audience to get more patrons. Stop being a dick.
---
Because some models could be changed to give you an advantage, my friend used a model edit that put a tunnel in the game that went under STV arena, where he could loot the chest.
---
Just tank with arms/fury talents while levelling.  The first three rows of prot is all defensive and you'll be fighting for threat anyways.  Your shield and defensive stance will be enough starting out and even if you're not optimal it won't be the end of the world.
---
It's a MT trinket so if the bear is MT then sure he can have first DFT :)
---
Lol, that isn't what I meant by min-max.
---
Or you could just not worry about it? It doesn't affect you anyway. Some people want to me mage #178463, other want to play something they think is different and cool.
---
I think they're factoring in farm times.
---
Everything from TBC and on was downhill in a lot of aspects
---
I'm sorry, I don't think everyone was asking for you to make their opinions for them? Because for some people it does.
---
Hm I understand that, but changing my character to undead didn't affect the game. Like to other players I was still a gnome.
---
I got the impression they were only needing to do this for half a dozen or so of the accounts.
---
Did you honestly try to say that WoD was under appreciated? 
---
Cata, sure. MoP, sure. 
---
But *WOD*?
---
Truthfully I love that that option exists.  I have no interest in Druid myself, but I just think it's so cool they have a path to making their dps viable if they want to put in the crazy amount of extra effort.  I wish there was something I could spend 5 hours/day farming to make elemental viable raid dps.
---
Yeah, but the main place I see ads on android is in the YouTube app. Firefox can't help me there.

Can we stop with the "X changes need to be made to classic" threads before it releases. Jesus christ if you dont like what classic brings dont play it, go back to BFA.
---
Jesus christ the amount of entitlement is just insane. Transcribing someone's work and putting it on the internet for the public is against copyright law.
---
You can itemize in any way you see fit. Keep in mind these are all min/max perspectives. Yes, Ashjre'thul is the absolute best until that Naxx  xbow. It's not to say the gun from Ouro isn't good, it is, but the crossbows are just better. Period.
---
Oh actually it doesn't. I tried both /use Pickpocket and /cast Pickpocket
---
Exactlt
---
I agree with everything, but you will get nothing but downvotes sadly. Most here want the game frozen in time and will be happy to play it as is for decades as you mentioned.
---
Yeha but you still probably shouldn't do it. Blizzard sometimes bans people for stupid things. If you want to look undead just play undead.
---
Fair enough! I was actually going to contact you beforehand and see if you'd want it posted on the website but I understand your concerns.
---
Years ago, I quit classic wow just after Burning Crusade to appease my unappeasable wife.
---
Now she’s my cheating ex wife and I won’t make that choice again.
---
MGTOW and WoW here I come!
---
You are asking for me to pay to get something done, on top of the hours of work I’ve put into the show, so you can enjoy it the way YOU want, rather than the way in which I’ve presented it. Which I’ll say again, is free.
---
It’s not elitist. It’s not a shitty attitude. You wouldn’t contact a director and ask for a script of his movie, because you can’t sit in the theatre and watch it.

---
No sorry mate I couldn’t tell you. My main was a holy priest (that I leveled as holy) and I didn’t really start a warrior until well into it because our group was frustrated at trying to pug a tank for alts.

Succ loses a lot of value in PvP as Alliance compared to Horde because of WotF. Then again, your entire class loses a lot of value because of WotF. 
---
If you're going in blind, especially as Alliance, Felhunter is probably safer. Succ takes more skill to use properly.
---
I wouldn't be surprised tbh.  Not everybody here sucks, but if you spent some time reading this sub long enough you'll realize there are some very angry mindsets going into this.
---
Why are some names blue and others green?
---
I usually never bother with Instant Poison. Crippling on the MH and either Mind-numbing or Wound on the OH. You can macro weapon swaps to have all 3 up at the same time.
---
I mean.. I thought what Trollgodx did was kinda funny. 
---
*shrug* 
---
I don’t really have any sympathy for non-blizzard sanctioned events getting disrupted on a pvp server.
---
Blizzards view from vanilla to wrath was very different. Aka Activision got involved(fun police). Priest can use MC on an add in UBRS and buff fire res to people. They caught this in vanilla and said cleaver use of game mechs. World buffs are the same thing. Stop trying to ruin other peoples fun.  And I'm most certain that SP rogue will be in Classic cause it was in vanilla. Next thing you'll all be crying cause tauren attack range is an (exploit). Anyone who thinks World Buffs shouldn't be in raid should find a guild that doesn't require them or raid BFA and be happy with only having to buy your 300g flask
---
But how are they playing AV in the beta  at lvl 40?
---
Yes as I personally know somebody who is interested in your content but also hearing impaired and thus unable to listen to it. 
---
so what bothers you so much about having a transcript for that person? Is it because you can't squeeze all the add money out of them on YouTube? and as you say if you do this content for free why do you care about reaping the benefits?
---
Right, but you choose your spec and no spec except a PvP spec would use this weapon. Then considering weapon skill (to my understanding) doesn't matter in PvP, I don't really get OP's intention.
---
A) It's way too early to discuss
---
B) I rather want TBC-&gt;Wrath and so on since it's only fair that the fans of other expansions get their favorite expansion remade.
---
holy shit its pick pocket not pickpocket.
---
You got the vael kill by using Nefs head world buff? Lol ok
---
I'll be whipping out the Enhancment DPS! Played it for years and I love it even when it's bad and everyone else dislikes it.
---
That said, I'm thr kind of person who plays what I want, but I always do my utmost to perform to the best of my abilities with my chosen play style. 
---
I will show up with world buffs, flasks, potions, consumables, resist gear, full BiS and everything.
---
This is how I enjoy my game.
---

---
there is trinity, tanks, healers, dps (melee and ranged).
---
it is not very p2w. money is so easy to get in albion that anyone dropping tons or IRL cash to get in game currency is an absolute moron. with that said, sure you CAN dump a bunch of money in, but it wont make you any good at the game. IE, if you buy the best gear available, even with a decent level of skill, you can (and will) still get nuked by 3 claw gankers in flat 4. there is a massive balance. 
---
pvp is pretty balanced from my perspective, but i also have been playing for quite some time and can see counters and builds (in both small group and zerg play) quite quickly. from a brand new players point of view you may see some shit and think its just broken, but....it isnt, you just have be better prepared next time. 
---
tldr: this game is basically if EVE and LoL had a baby. the focus is PvP, in every way. market manipulation, open world tactics, and individual reputation.
---
That name takes me back.
---
Still not 36. 2-3 hours of gold farming is enough for a hardcore guild.
---
Yes, unless you want to purposefully gimp yourself by
---
* Using +8 agi enchants instead of the +24 RAP/10stam/1% hit ZG enchants
---
* Running 1% crit/AP neck despite it being worse than the 30agi/1% hit neck from Nefarian
---
* Running no hit rings for some reason, which means that you're massively gimping yourself considering that the agi/hit ring are better than the non-hit agi rings. That or you somehow got QSR despite it being perma-bis for fury wars.
---
* Running no tier gear for whatever reason
---
And regardless of all the above, Larve of the Great Worm still doesn't drop from Ouro until Naxx opens up.
---
Fuck yes I am.
---
Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material is illegal my man.
---
Feared that would have been the case.
---
Yes, that is the plan on paper but I have no data on it sadly. Adding Hand of Justice into it could also fuel it somewhat.
---
hahaha
---
Yes, I’d say by AQ40 and Naxx it’ll be nearly useless unless your raid has a large amount of hunters
---
I dunno, I was in both a hard core guild for a while and then a casual guild.
---
**Hardcore** \- The Guild's mission was progression. If you were off spec, you weren't aligned to the mission. Gfy. If you weren't performing, or coming prepared... find something else to do. I had exactly zero life during that phase of my life and did a lot of the alchemy work, I would over farm and fill in for people who had family in town, other obligations etc. I'd get money from the gbank for other things for that because I couldn't sell my wares. We had a number of people like that, but everyone was devoted to the mission. There was an understanding that just about everyone was contributing to the goal one way or another. We did well because of it. Not world first, but very respectable progress on our server Top 3-5, and consistent without being too far behind in timing.  It wasn't so much shitting on people for playing the game a different way, if you didn't want to play our way find another guild. This is our mission, take it or leave it. It's pretty selfish in my opinion to roll with a group of people who are locked on to a specific goal and not do everything you can to make that happen. That includes playing a spec you don't like.
---
"Expect to be yelled at, get your shit together, be on time and pay attention." Not getting yelled at is a great motivator. 
---
**Casual** \- Lots of people in reserve, didn't have the same group every time. We'd start late, we would teach people something every single night. Consumables were optional, gear was straight dkp. 
---
We just didn't get very far, quickly. It was much less stressful, and was more fun to rib people who would fuck up without this serious pants vibe going. Maybe it was by sheer virtue that Karazhan was such a great raid, we all didn't mind running it over and over again. I think we ended up getting as far as Hydross in SSC, and struggle with Gruul. Memory is hazy.
---
I'm not a point in my life where I can be hardcore, I can't do that again. I'd like to find a group that's medium core for classic. A bunch of tryhards without the extra time so when we're there, we're focused and ready to make the most of it. I would hope that excludes people who want to play off the viable spec, not because they are shit players and terrible people, that just wouldn't be our groups goal. They should find a crew that welcomes them, instead of trying to force that on a team who is going to suffer negatively from it.
---
I don't know how many encounters I've had in my life where the boss lives by 1%-5%, it's heartbreaking. If you have a raid slot being occupied by someone who can make that difference, but chooses not to, it brings down guild morale as whole. Again, that's only if the guilds mission prioritized thusly. Some guilds don't care, lose by 3%, who cares laugh it off buff up and roll again.
---
I think people are trying to project their own desires onto everyone and those desires are different across the board. There's going to be a lot of guilds and groups of people to run with and you need to find one that aligns with how you want to play the game.
---
I’m done with this argument. You’ve been told how you can help your less fortunate friend.
---
WHY
---
I can count the amount of ingame disputes I’ve had with my Guildies over the last ten years on my elbow...
---
I guess if you like to stir up drama all the time it could trickle over but I’d assume if you can’t get along with people in your recreational time you probably have troubles getting along on professional time as well.
---
I think you should make the transfer freely available because those who are hearing impaired might need it
---
I was thinking the same thing. Sort of defeats the purpose.
---
Same thing I was thinking lol. The OP just wants to steal our names!
---
Rage comic? Shit, it really is 2006 again.
---
The easiest example of gain from the racial is from scopes, normal you use the +3% hit one to cap more easily. The direct substitution for this is the sniper scope for +7dmg on hit, which is about a 3 dps increase at 2.5 speed (strikers mark).
---
Could find better increases based on more significant gear/talent changes, but this is the most direct comparison.
---
It's not nearly as impactful as melee, but not for nothing.
---
Well, they are only partially to blame.  A fairly large fault lies with Blizzard for being so incompetant at balancing in the early days that some specs were *universially considered infefior* in almost every way.
---
It attracts people that want to play an Alliance pet class but don't want face Horde as a Warlock
---
This always the argument I see. People are like “I want to play enhancement in a 5 man” and all the elitists are “well you’re going to hate wiping 20 times a minute on kel’thuzad!!!!”
---
Like, you can assume when people are talking about memspecs (I hate that word, I feel it’s toxic for the community) they aren’t talking about end game raiding when they say anything about being “viable”
---
Literally the only two lines of lyrics I knew when I was 15 years old.
---
The problem is that some people would change scenery models or player models to be more easily spotted.
---
Since it’s harder for Blizzard to tell *what* you changed a model to instead of just seeing that you changed a model, they banned it completely. 
---
I don’t really care if it only affects your game, your argument doesn’t really matter, Blizzard sets the rules and it’s bannable.
---
As a warlock your bad match-ups are Warrior and Rogue and your Mage friend would have those bases covered for you. You'll also have great CC options on separate DR counters. Shaman/Mage isn't much of a combo — the totems don't benefit Mage since they won't need windfury and I'm guessing they're undead so tremor is redundant.
---
I must have misinterpreted your question then
---
Play shaman, level as enh and then heal at 60 :D
---
But it was in a pve area... wut
---
Solo-wise I just want to never die, even if I get distracted by texting or taking my dog outside for two minutes. Speed doesn’t matter to me. Group-wise I mostly want to heal and buff people because I like helping others, but Warlock has a ton of useful utility skills like summons so I’m thinking about trying to main a DPS for the first time ever (I’ve always healed in retail). 
---
So I’m struggling to decide between Paladin, Shaman, Warlock or Druid.
---
People asked for classic servers for like 12 years....
---
TFA was pretty good. It had some weird stuff you gotta get past but it also set up the next couple of movies pretty well.
---
This.  The gear was garbage. All casters had the same gear, with maybe 2 or 3 spell/healing power items.  Couldn't down rank spells as a priest effectively, and mages/warlocks were stacked on spirit.
---
There was also nothing to work toward.  A 3 hour AV isn't fun if you're not getting rep, honor ranks/gear, etc.
---
I do not expect BG's to have the same reception when classic is live.
---
Is it mathematically possible - yes.
---
Will people attempt it - most definitely.
---
Is it easy - no.
---
Time will tell if it will be completed and at what cost.
---
Pushing to 70 as Arcane/Frost in TBC was euphoria
---
If I change all gnomes to be bright pink and 20 feet tall. Does that effect the game? Pve most likely not but for pvp it definitely has an effect. You can't have 1 without the other.
---
I'll keep this in consideration thank you :)

I've always preferred to get the 1-20 sprint down asap and then take my time from there, but damn idk that I've come anywhere near that time for 1-10!
---
Do you have any general tips that'd translate into overall leveling efficiency? Like for example I seem to remember reading that it was generally recommended to kill any experience granting mobs that are directly en route from A to B whenever you're traveling, rather than just running by the.

Fire resist gear?
---
Firefox on mobile devices has addons? I just switched over from Chrome to Firefox recently, across both PC and mobile. (iPhone)
---
Not to mention druid offtanks aren't competing for plate tank items during progression.  
---
There's a spec that allows druids to competently offtank, heal, or DPS as the situation requires. They're not going to be topping any charts, but still..
---
 I don't care enough to try stop discussion, I think it's too early, and I think making wild speculation/ideas about the "future" without any feedback from blizzard is pointless and a waste of time.
---
But like I said, I really don't care enough about the "too early" argument, feel free to discuss I suppose but I wish it didn't fill up my feed.
---
They dont understand how long things take r develop.  They would need to start pretty soon what comes next
---
You're really so against helping the hearing impaired that you wouldn't put a link to a transcript of your podcast in the description of a community member made it for?
---
I hope this realize how bad this looks on your home podcast brand and I hope more people learn about this.
---
&lt; Currently unemployed. Had an interview Monday. Did my best, but secretly hoping I dont find anything until a month or two after launch.
---
Preshattering patch killed wow for me. Will be coming back to classic
---
Your argument is built on the premise that the account t sharers dont care enough to practice. They do. They are people like the OP of this post. 
---
Every server first 60 will be a shared account. Even Joana has said as much.
---
That's the thing though, WoW means virtually nothing to their profit line and that's the reason they keep trying to choke WoW out of existence. Cutting the teams working on it and going hard on mobile games. And the candy bar analogy isn't really true since a candy bar wont have any influence on the game's economy at all while buying gold actually does, which is okay for modern WoW titles but the economy in Classic would make buying gold pretty much Pay2Win.
---
But that contradicts your previous comment I replied to. If you're actually thinking about guild progression and not just your own loot then the weapon will go to the person that gives the guild largest dps boost. 
---
If your top dps only gets a 5dps improvement from it but your worst gets a 50dps it's clear who it should go to. The top dps shouldn't get upset about not getting it because they care about guild progression and this will help the guild more than them getting it.
---
Most gamers during that time period in the US did. Gaming wasn't mainstream yet, and was just part of the sub-culture so both went hand in hand.
---
Right?? I feel like many people feel obligated to choose the BEST possible base and starting point just to even roll a character
---
That is not true. The main reason they added Crossrealm was for shorter queue times
---
I am well aware that some servers were dominated by certain factions. If you played on a Horde dominant server, the game encouraged the Alliance to form premades and use teamwork to win bgs. That is what server community is about. Besides, you were never ranked against the enemy faction. Players would climb honor ranks regardless because od this.
---
Vanilla Hunter is the clunkiest thing since clunk came to clunktown.
---
This is from a diehard Hunter player... who is likely playing Mage or Rogue in Classic. Vanilla Hunter is a *very* acquired taste... and they suck beyond Phase 3.
---
Nice spin.
---
Yea but this guy playing a memespec in a guild that isn’t mine that raids on different days is making us wipe every night. It’s totally his fault and not ours.
---
I'm personally a fan of combined EPGP and Loot Council.
---
Reasons for EPGP
---
* Best dkp system IMO
---
* Provides an unbiased source of data for loot council
---
* Handles majority of loot distribution
---
* Allows for explicit tracking of player contributions\*
---
Reasons for Loot Council
---
* Allows you to setup a plan for guild progression
---
* Helps deal with drama surrounding high contention items
---
* Can help mitigate hoarding dkp for specific items
---
\* for example, I like to give a weekly stipend of EP to all members of the guild. They can award that EP to any other member for helping them by whispering an officer. Setting up a similar system with loot council only wouldn't really work.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree.  Flying mounts, LFR, ability pruning, and no sense of community would turn it into retail.
---
New level 60 raid content on it's own doesn't fundamentally ruin the game the way the expansions did.
---
Apologies, I misread. I thought you said Retail and Classic use the same settings.  
---
You're correct.
---
Whoa whoa whoa. Where did I ever say that? Good lord. I can find something funny and wrong at the same time
---
What I want is a complete departure from Blizzard's design philosophy. How about an expansion that DOESN'T increase the level cap? How about an expansion that gives a new race and class and opens up some new LOW LEVEL content.
---
The best part of classic, for me, is levelling. Spending a few months on a new toon, bumming around and questing and working up skills. So give me more to do on that journey. Open up some new level 30 quests. Maybe a new dungeon at level 20. A few new patterns to unlock through rep.
---
Instead of a constant 'vertical' progression, where all that matters is working on one max level character, how about 'horizontal' progression, that incentivizes creating new alts (and spending months levelling them).
---
&gt; There's very little value to, say, an Arms Warrior, in getting a full set of Might (outside of the raw stats). Druids will make more usage of a reduced Tranquility Cooldown than Hurricane CDR. The meme specs will die out and the hardcore "progression" scene will fill their ranks with people playing their characters "right". If you want to be a part of that scene, you gotta play your role, and that's okay too.
---
Yeah, and for everything that is great about vanilla, this wasn't one of them and its a real damn shame that Blizzard dropped the ball with this aspect.
---
My first guild master was a retired man in his 60s who had grandkids who were in the guild. Definitely a bunch of older people who play, especially now since it's 15 years since original launch so people who might have been in their late 40s then could potentially be retired now
---
Did they explain how he survived being cut in half and falling down a seemingly bottomless pit? Feel like that warrants an explanation.  
---
Or because it was a cartoon was it treated kinda like Wile E. Coyote falling down a ravine but being fine the next scene.
---
The difference with dungeon and raid finder is that you can queue from anywhere in the world. With Classic BG system, you still have to go to a specific location to queue up and talk to an NPC. There you will see other players looking to queue up and you can make groups that way.
---
Epgp is really nice I agree. One of my favorites.
---
This is one of the few non hunter weapons cause its a mace
---
Must be really hard living life where you cant wait for others peoples choices to not be as fulfilling as they had hoped
---
Aspiring tank questions!
---
How truly helpless are tank-spec warriors in the open world? If "extremely", how hard is it to afford frequent respecs?
---
How many tanks do raids usually take? Is it one tank to the group of 40? Or is it one tank per each pod of 5? Will trying to b a tank wind up making it harder for me to get into raids?
---
Lastly, how much threat does a paladin manage to output as a prot spec? I've found that by stacking MP5 as high as i can, and downranking consecration when needed, I can keep some pretty fantastic up-times as a prot paladin. But none of that matters if the threat I'm generating isn't enough to hold the mobs' attention.
---
That sweet sweet karma. I always wanted to make one back then but I never got around to learning how to do it right.  /Some regrets
---
They had some bad dialogue and jar jar. That’s not enough to ruin good actual Star Wars movies. Total fail analysis.
---
Start all over with fresh servers
---
&gt; Plus they deserve any stream sniping they get, they are announcing where they are and what they're doing. If they don't like it don't roll PvP. Super easy.
---
How did he get so bad after being considered a god back in the day? I just don't understand it
---
From WotLK and onwards I used to raidlead pugs, and pugs only. I can't imagine how shit that would be with a 40 man raid, but am kinda curious.
---
Onyxia's head gives the same buff moron. And you've also got Songlower Serenade, the Fire Resist buff in Blackrock Spire, Warchief's Blessing, Dire Maul Tribute, and Darkmoon Faire.
---
All told, that's:
---
* 18% spell cirt
---
* 10% physical crit
---
* 340 AP
---
* 15 all stats
---
* 300 HP
---
* 15% Max HP
---
* 15% melee haste
---
* 10 MP5
---
* 83 fire resist
---
* 1 to 10% all damage
---
All available before ever seeing Nefarian.
---
that's the spec that gets used once you have a selection of gear that allows you to lose the hit from the SV tree. until ZG comes out or you're equipping some key t1 pieces, you'll need to keep that extra hit from SV to reach the hit cap
---
You could live for all of classic on savings and get rank 14 and frostsabre
---
"Only help in the way that is financially beneficial to me, guys!  It's all about me!"
---
There were so many solutions. Blizzard instead implemented a system that had so many negative ramifications and now we are stuck with it, eventhough it was barely in Classic.
---
Who cares? And it’s not that people are “advocating” for memespecs just because they don’t want to follow a guide
---
But is this actually the argument against it? I have to ask you the same question as the guy before:
---
Do you believe the game becomes better, if the activity you like most is stopped by an arbitrary timer that potentially says "no, you're not allowed to play this mode for another hour, go out and explore the world!". Maybe you do, PvE is limited in a similar way with raids, though you can spam dungeons all you like.
---
I can see how you're pro community and against the retail idea. But the argument here honestly feels like you want to tell people how to enjoy the game and that's not a good argument. Instant PvP queues are NOT bad. Instant PvP queues exist without crossrealm too on balanced servers, and maybe one will even exist between all the unbalanced ones. But saying "this improves classic" is a joke.
---
Hats what they call you even when fully specced
---
I think a lot of people took it as I hate rogues and, was mad. When I am genuinely just confused by rogues who "virtue signal." I love rogues. I love that they can kill people twirl their mustache and fade into shadows. I love that they become the villains of the server as I think it helps build class fantasy and server Identity.
---
No it doesnt lmao
---
That’s right, when it’s a free podcast, with no ad revenue.
---
Exactly!  I'm saying new raid content or maybe even new BGs, but that's all.  No level cap increase or any of the other standard expansion horseshit.  Why on earth do people see that as wrong?
---
First off, you can probably dismiss the NElf Druid and focus on the decision between Rogue vs Warrior. If you're not a fan of the jack of all trade / master of none, you won't like it. 
---
As for Rogue vs Warrior, it really depends on your lifestyle and how you picture yourself playing the game. Keep in mind that dungeon running in Vanilla is *very* time consuming (LFG, run to the dungeon, wait on afk, etc. etc.). Of course Warriors will be in more demand than rogues once it comes to end-game, but even then the polls show that Warriors will be over represented. 
---
Since you like both classes, it's more of a question of playing solo vs in ground in the context of Vanilla WoW.
---
A transcript is not pirating your content. It's presenting your content in a format you apparently have no intentions of doing. 
---
Your title here on reddit is also rather clickbait tbh. It's not an ex-dev talking about all that stuff. The World Buff topic caught my interest. Turns out it's just the same two random guys rehashing their position. Not an ex-dev, whose opinion would matter a lot more.
---
Oops, fixed it now.
---
Where's drowning pool, bodies. It was on almost every pvp video I ever watched.
---
&gt;A faerie fire or dot that forces an early cloak of shadows takes away a strong cooldown that they rely on.
---
I think you've gotten confused or you didn't play Vanilla, because Rogues got Cloak of Shadows in TBC not Vanilla.
---
Play rogue, get ironfoe and hand of justice. Best of both worlds.
---
All the new Star Wars suck
---
Exactly, so I think we're gonna start just making bootleg free transcripts to help out all of the hearing impaired community, not just one person.
---
Same here! I learned about Them from a rogue pvp video. Iirc he was ganking some paladin in brd or some thing. Ditched My 45mage gnome mage, right there and made an undead rogue. Played him until wotlk and never looked back
---
So realistically 2750 DPS Warriors and 1150 Tanks.
---
Yes if you download the Twitch client, it will automatically install addons for you and it also makes it easy to keep them updated - just open the Twitch client launcher and it shows you which need updating, and a quick click of the button will take care of that for you.  A few seconds later you're done and ready to game.
---
My wife was the first ninja looter that I ever encountered in game.
---
I was waiting for her to join me in Desolace and was just grinding some mobs and a blue ring dropped and I had to roll on it.  I was like WTF?!?  And then in chat it said she won the roll.  She had just gotten into loot range as I was looting the mob.  I asked her to give me the ring and she laughed and said no.
---
That was nearly 15 years ago and I am still angry about it.
---
Would you post a link to a transcript someone made you for free? Seems pretty shitty to hate that community so much that you'd willingly hide that.
---
&gt; Guild twinks exist,
---
Guilds of griefing jerks are possible too, but it would be disingenuous to pretend that griefing is not "antisocial" if you have friends who join in on it. That is as asinine as arguing that it's not antisocial to kick over people's bins if you and your best mates all do it together.
---
&gt; PvP is not some care bear festival.
---
False dichotomy. Nobody is arguing for perfect balance, so save your breath. Just that twinks are so overpowered they ruin the game.
---
&gt; Levelers can easily avoid twinks with minimal effort.
---
Individual levellers, sure, they can just not PvP. But why should everyone have to miss out on a fun part of the game just because twinkers want to spoil it?
---
&gt; How does that logic not apply to literally any normal gameplay that happens on PvP servers? 
---
News flash, not everyone rolls on PvP servers. Even if they did, the good thing about battlegrounds normally is that nobody from outside the bracket can get in and gank you. And basic human decency applies to games, whether it is a game "about a war" or about anything else because Risk is not really a war and neither is Warsong Gulch.
---
I think if you roll on a PvP server you deserve whatever you get. And if you join a 10-19 battleground the upper end of what you should encounter is a level 19 toon, not a toon with an effective level around 25 that has dropped out of levelling to spend its life griefing levellers.
---
&gt; You directly compared it to using an aimbot in a multiplayer FPS. Quit back peddling and moving goal posts.
---
You just don't understand analogies on even the most basic level, do you? If someone says "this relationship is like a banana" you will look like an absolute moron if you respond "ha ha ha you just said this relationship is yellow and squashy and high in calcium ha ha you're stupid I win!!!".
---
Here's a clue that will get you a long way in future primary school level reading comprehension: analogies are meant to be alike only in one specific aspect.
---
I did respond to you scroll up.
---
Sure, but when I did it, it only changed my character. Gnomes were still gnomes to me. Only my character was undead.
---
Honestly, if you have 25 "try hards" in pre-raid BiS you can probably clear MC. So i'd say about 15 "try hards" assuming the healers and tanks are all in that group, can carry a mixed group of 25 "normies" and scrubs.
---
Why not promote binds and becoming a better player? You dont have to be a world first raider to want to improve
---
I like Druids in vanilla. I just like them less than warrior and rogue.
---
Blizzard also repeatedly stated they would never release Classic.  Why do you take what they say at face value anymore or think their decisions cant' change, especially if Classic is a massive success?
---
If you're in a raiding Guild that's heavy on warlocks one shadow priest will be put in a raid For the shadow weaving debuff. Then you'll just spam mind flay.
---
I mean it does, as this is an MMO and the community being flooded with people trying to make brokenly undrpowered specs work directly effects anyone trying to play the game.
---
I was wondering if "retail classic" would cause confusion, so I updated it to "live classic" to avoid any further ambiguity.
---
&gt;Well received newcomer
---
Eh, only because people assumed part 2 would give us some answers and an interesting story, which I guess is similar to Legion.
---
I agree that Cata, MoP and WoD were very underappreciated, especially Cata and WoD.
---
That's why he's gaming the algorithm so hard.
---
According to theorycrafters, there may be a viable shock-a-din build that uses damage procs, the crowd pummeler activatable 2 hander, and +spell damage as the main sources of damage.
---
I’ll just take one order of TBC and WoTLK please
---
Welcome to the hunter class, where we get next to no upgrades in AQ40 and have to compete with healers for tier gear tokens and melees for non-tier gear in Naxx. There are only 2 items that we don't compete on, and those are the agi polearm from Loatheb and the Xbow from Kel'Thuzad. 
---
We definitely get screwed over hard in the later tiers, but it is what it is.
---
Because it starts in 70 minutes? I am unsure of what your question is
---
I seem to remember seeing Master Loot will not be in the game.
---
Its the same as warrior using hamstring method but we use totem 2h + rockbiter to swing move out swing, so you trade 1 for 1 blow all the time and you get less downtime.
---
There’s a time stamp in the description that you can cut to :)
---
Gnomish has all the good BoP stuff, goblin has all the BoE stuff, so you can just go gnomish and buy from goblins. Or like people said, level gnomish, get the items then reroll and there's a dude in tanaris that will switch it for 150g. Not worth IMO.
---
You married that?
---
Right??? MC, onyxia, ZG. Those raids were filled with unconventional specs. Naxx and AQ are different, but it wasnt uncommon to have boomkins there aswell lol.
---
I remember a bug i used back in Wrath, where if you logged in on a character using the enter key and then at the same time clicked onto another character on your rooster real quick you'd get the first character but with the look of the secondary one, dunno if it was in earlier versions than wrath, thats when i discovered it.
---
Stress test doesn't start for another hour. 4pm PDT is the start time.
---
As a someone who did PvP as a warlock from Vanilla to WotLK, I do not agree with the cc and survivability part of your comment. Through the use of fear, death coil, pet CC, siphon life, drain life, healthstones, void sac, soul link; warlocks are very tanky.
---
Mobility could also be argued considering the fact that non-destro locks can dot &amp; kite their targets. Not having to cast most of your spells is a major plus.
---
I mean sure, don't follow the guides that are out there with all the math done and all the work laid out for you to check.
---
But you're just investing a huge amount of time into trying to make soemthing work that we know, and have known for the past 15 years, does not work.
---
Who's to say that they're in a country with such opressive copyright laws?
---
Isn’t releasing new level 60 raids what they did throughout Vanilla?  Did Vanilla end exactly at the magical number of raids that can be considered content?
---
im intrigued - what would an example macro look like? there are so many settings i would want to change immidiately - auto-loot all, turn off smart camera turn, increase cam distance, add actionbars. 
---
is there a way to do this in a cimple macro i can copy paste at luanch?
---
How do you know Azshara Crater is a bad BG? It never existed.
---
What is dvt? Sounds like solid advice on the energy drinks but they do pack a sometimes necessary punch
---
the point is lets have this first thing happen and then maybe we can have this conversation in the future. we have waited so long for classic and immediately asking for the next thing sounds entitled, especially when a large amount of us dont care about new content and could replay vanilla for the next 10 years and be happy
---
Trust me, mage #256311 will be there to replace the mage you kicked out of your raid for not making your dps requirement.
---
How is it edited?
---
Its gonna be fun when y'all realize how easy it is to ninja and have nobody care.
---
yeah about an hour from now
---
good luck getting in but its happening
---
Then why wpuld you care if it's transcribed on reddit.
---
If your content is not good enough to carry itself (i.e. warrant being listened to for any other reason than a wow dev being a guest) it wont matter if one episode is transcriped or not.
---
All in all you're far from presenting yourself as a very likeable host right now and shoukd consider changing your stance/creating your own transcript to release
---
Of course it will.
---
People been acting all day like "wtf why are the servers down this isnt fair" when none of them took the time to read the info on the stress test to see what time it was even supposed to start. lol.
---
Mor'Ladim still scares me.
---
Yes. Everyone will definitely hate the last guy on the dps meter. Spit on that loser. MC is so hard anyway!! and now we have to carry that boomkin too??
---
Not really; I'm doing pretty well actually. But if you're looking for fulfilling life choices out of a re-release of a 15 year old MMO, maybe you need to give your own life a second look?
---
Just a thought..
---
Ooo the message tnks
---
Holy will be the easiest healer for all types of gameplay. In pvp holy and druid are the hardest to kill.
---
it was the beginning but it didn't matter at the time.
---
People forming dungeon groups in vanilla don't discourage other people from forming groups.
---
People playing the same dungeon do not spy on each other in order to dodge or time when you join.
---
People grouping for dungeons do not do the same dungeon all day every single day.
---
It's different because the entire system is different. Asking this question at all is akin to saying how is PvP and PvE different?
---
K! Simple solution. 
---
Make classic servers 
---
Classic+ servers 
---
TBC servers 
---
WOTLK servers
---
Simple and everyone is happy.
---
So everyone who's hearing impaired should personally contact you? When you could just put a link to a transcript? Seems like a lot of effort to go thru just to keep hearing impaired people off of your content.
---
If you are on the underpopulated realm, can't you just form a premade and fight pugs on the overpopulated realm. Since the overpopulated realm has more players, wouldn't they also likely have more pug groups?
---
&gt; You are a perfect example of the type of person who only focuses on the negatives. what a sad way to live life.
---
I think you are projecting again. You can tell straight away when a person starts going on about "liberals".
---
&gt; i'm not the one being oversensitive, entitled, whiny, or selfish regarding this matter. the people who want the game changed because they don't like how others play it are the oversensitive entitled ones.
---
Because you are handling criticism so well? And doing such a mature job of considering other people's point of view?
---
&gt; I also use that Stronger character to kill twinks that are on the enemy team.
---
Or get killed by them. But we know from history that the moment twinks can't club seals the overwhelming majority of them log off and never come back.
---
&gt; playing a video game in the way to get as most advantage as possible to beat people in a competition (PvP Battleground) isn't the same as physically abusing people in real life for no reason.
---
It's choosing to ignore every other aspect of the video game to find one tiny niche where you can drop out and be an ongoing pest to passers-by forever. You can pat yourself on the back for "beating people in a competition" but the whole point of twinking is to amass such a massive advantage that beating people is guaranteed even without skill.
---
&gt; You mentioned boxing so I wanted to say something about me competing in boxing
---
You are very special and we all care very much about whatever it is you feel like talking about.
---
Isn't that a tacit confirmation that they wanted it in 60- content? Effectively ocking old world buffs out of expansion content, without preventing it's use in the content it was made for.
---
This is ridiculously skewed due to streamers. This will look much different within a month after live.
---
When you get to Naxx mages need 2 debuff slots instead of 1, imp scorch and ignite.
---
They cut it
---
More important why no RPPVP?
---
/Equip absolutely works in Classic.  However, it doesn't work on Private servers because they are based on 1.12.1 API.  Classic is based on version 8.X.X API.
---
It was. You had dungeon finder, which I believe was the start of the breakdown in the whole community thing but it wasn't horrible. You had heirlooms, but you had to grind a ton of emblems for one and the xp boost was negligible. In the end though, it was the best xpac. You had good class balance in pve and pvp, professions were relevant, and Thrall was still warchief
---
That's trippy and cool.
---
Improved scorch replaced winter's chill.
---
* in a very thin slice of the overall experience
---
They're acknowledging it is problematic and makes things easy
---
You’re posting on a thread about paladins levelling in healing spec and gear, and seemed to suggest bgs? Nonsense really
---
&gt; If I remember correctly you only bring like max 2 deep prot warriors
---
This changes as your guild progresses, at one point tank itemization shifts so that defensive stats past a certain point are no longer wanted, and threat generation becomes the new "primary" stats. Warriors that go full prot+fully geared get rage starved from too much damage avoidance.
---
Hinterlands when I was grinding my warrior through the mid to late 40s, turning in beads to the dwarves (that didn't actually give me anything to get them to exalted).
---
Yeah questing will be our main source but we will at least do every dungeon more then once for a good gear drop
---
Does arms have more output then fury?
---
&gt; But what If I'm a 5/10 warrior?
---
Then playing with the macro will keep you as a 5/10 warrior where as manually switching when you should switch will quickly put you to a 6/10 warrior and then climb from there.
---
&gt; " suggests you are the tank. If you are the tank...
---
No, it suggests if you're in defensive stance it wont switch, the two are very different.
---
&gt; Whether you wanted to or not, you've helped me a great deal.
---
I really do want to help people you,  both getting the macro to work, but at the same time I feel it's my responsibility to help you improve as a player at the same time :)
---
Define “works” 
---
Enhance works fine for leveling and even some 5 mans.
---
Also hunter T2.
---
\*push\*
---
&gt; The ONLY way it lasts longer while retaining any significant player base will be to add new content. 
---
Or, you know, do what Private Servers have done for over 10 years keeping the game fun and open a fresh server after Naxx and then merge those servers after second naxx and open fresh again on a \~3year cycle.
---
I will consider doing so =)
---
Lol what? Why wouldn't it be. You're thinking of BFA.
---
I believe you meant 2pm PDT
---
Not to your discussion, but the thread/post you were discussing?  Whatever the guy was talking that he wrote up in 30 minutes after being ganked on an alt.  I look on the link and I only see social media links on the page.
---
Which one, I wanna play
---
I basically started playing in late mop (I say basically started because I played on my dads acc in Vanilla a little bit and had my own account in late cata-early mop but didn’t really do anything on it) and I loved SoO. It was my first experience really raiding with a guild and wouldn’t have traded that for anything. I quit in WoD right as HFC came out and I enjoyed it. My guild at that point pretty much disbanded as we weren’t raiding any WoD content but I enjoyed what I did in WoD. I guess I was blinded by the fact that I was able to experience playing a new expac from the beginning to realize that WoD kinda sucked. Came back to the game about a month and a half ago, haven’t bought BFA cuz I heard it wasn’t that great and I’ve been loving the legion endgame content that I have available. Might buy BFA just for some new content but then again I might just wait until classic releases.
---
Do I need to have an active wow subscription for this stress test?
---
&gt;Because vanilla is hard. 
---
No it's not. Why do people keep saying this? Just because retail is trivial doesn't mean vanilla is hard. 
---
&gt;When you're in the mid-levels, hybrid or non-tank spec "tanks" will definitely impact the group. 
---
At mid levels arms tanking is fine.  Unless you did you healing on a pserver with their high elite damage, but even then it's still fine.
---
I have to say that I think if you want a ranged dps class that has a pet which is an animal, and want to hunt things, you should really be considering hunter.
---
Meme spec /=/ bad player 
---
Meme specs can work.
---
I don't know all the settings I'll put into it yet, I don't have beta access, but let's start with autoloot, enable it with this:
---
 /console autoLootDefault 1
---
It’s going to be in classic so will the ability to trade with people that were in the party at time for 2 hours. Blizzard doesn’t want to be bother by non stop miss looting tickets.
---
Because the designer said so in interviews, that's why he scraped it. AB was better.
---
Imagine the worst parts of AB and AV, and combine them.
---
Right?!
---
Cata and WoD are definitely not "underappreciated in their time", people still hate them.
---
It’s not, everyone just wants to feel like the underdog
---
And put a bullet in retail’s head!
---
Dalaran wow is the best
---
R/wow = 1,057,713
---
We were given premade characters for AV test.
---
The ones that didn’t explode either before or during the questing and weren’t a joke dated even at the time we’re pretty good.
---
So yeah, most of them were bad.
---
understand the chance for ironfoe is around 1% drop and almost always reserverd for a Warrior... but could you imagine Ironfoe + Hand of Justice on a rogue
---
Oh do you mean the video that Melderon put up? Not sure if that’s what they were referencing?

What? :D Are you trying to tell me that WoW cant be fulfilling now at all? Haha come on man. Youre hanging in a classicwow subreddit telling people that the game everyone is excited for, wont be fulfilling? I dont understand where youre going with that. Hell yeah I expect the 15 year old MMO to be fulfilling. And I think everyone else here is here for the same reason lol. Well, everyone except you, apparently. :)

There also might be the problem of not enough healers because everyone who rolled pally or druid or whatever insisting that they're only going to DPS.

It's just overall bad for the game to have too many people being dedicated to trying to make the meme specs work.

&gt;Your best dps get's world buffs and uses full consumes and knows how to manage his cooldowns better so he gets exponential gains from the new weapon even though it's only a 5 dps upgrade over his previous weapon. 
---
&gt;Your worst dps might die 10 seconds into the fight cause he doesn't know how to avoid the fire. 
---
If these people are in the same raid then that's your problem. 
---
If the guild actually cares about progression player 2 won't be in the raid. If the guild doesn't care about progression the yes player 1 deserves the drop.
---
Haha an alliance player sold a gutripper to a horde player over neutral AH and I feel like he needs some zappin. I have the other gutripper, so natural rivalry :P
---
"You think you do, but you don't." SMUGFACE
---
Are these the same people that said “You think you want it but you don’t?”
---
I'm saying that equating what spec people chose to play with fulfilling life choices is kind of absurd. Getting a good job should give you a sense of fulfillment. Doing charitable works, getting your education, things like these are fulfilling life choices.
---
Playing a game should be about entertainment. A couple hours here, a couple hours there, just for the fun of it. If you're looking to games for fulfillment, that sounds like a problem.
---
You'd have better luck trying to transfer your retail UI than your 1.12 one.
---
You can watch YouTube videos on Firefox idiot.
---
It's called HOTW spec but you can't DPS very well with it

&gt; Firefox on mobile devices has addons?

Yes, and uBlock origin works on mobile there as well.

Interesting I have her going shadow now so it should be good to have her focus on damage although my goal for the night is to clear all the dungeons, I'll see how that goes. Honestly might go prot build to help with VC at 15

I think the solo types and newcomers liked legion well. Systematically it was bad, the story came off like bad fan fiction and paved the way for BfA. Mage tower was nice though.
---
Full clip: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/440538861?t=0h21m12s
---
He still says yes. Just says "we discovered it was kind of too much" after.
---
Classic doesn't care what they "discovered". It's primary goal is to be an authentic Vanilla WoW experience.
---
if you hit 40 and need a steed this wouldnt be a bad option and worth the time investment since mounts increase leveling speed a ton
---
In your opinion
---
Technically not sharding it's layering which is the whole continent
---
nobody cares about you. you're not cool
---
Yeah, I'm confused here.  I was in a guild that cleared Naxx.  We were doing Onyxia buffs to go into Molten Core.  You realized on your first Onyxia kill that there were world buffs.
---
There's a discussion on the podcast to remove world buffs acting on above level 60 players, but I don't think this was a "world buffs are an exploit" but it was because they didn't want level 70 players going back to level 60 raid content for world buffs.

For the record, i listened to this entire podcast and not a single mention of troll warriors....

Also thanks cause it was highly enjoyable and I will now consume all remaining 106 episodes in the next few days!

I hope you have fun.

Just as an addon question. Same topic so its not a total hijack. Anyone know if you can lock stuff on the action bars and use shift-click to move them again?
---
Maybe you should read your second paragraph of this comment again, and then think for a second how this whole chain started :) cheers man, just for the fun of t, we’re all here to play for entertainment
---
At least it's better than when people use "Cos"
---
lmfao
---
How do you think a dedicated speed runner such as yourself would fare against 2 people rotating a sleep schedule and never having to stop leveling?
---
Even with the ads the youtube app is nicer to navigate. :/
---
Amusing this comment got so heavily down-voted. I used to be a mildly e-famous elemental shaman.
---
&gt; I feel like the most common complaint of MoP is "kung fu pandas" but I've never found that decent criticism of the game. 
---
Well _I_ found it to be fucking stupid.
---
No you wont, youll give up at level 32 and go back to play apex legend .
---
During progression, maybe. Once the raid is on farm, all melee just use arcane prot pots and the boss dies in like 30 seconds.
---
uBlock origin. what year is this 2007?
---
People who are serious enough to go for week 1 rag clears have no problem couch surfing to share a PC to keep the same character leveling 24/7.
---
i would put wod with legion and bfa and call them dogshit
---
As opposed to the meal prepping - which is highly recommended - you could also go for a small easy to do cooking session as a break. If you game sort of casual this takes care of the whole getting up and moving thing and gives your mind a break with some handywork.
---
I plan on getting an addon like BadApples or something and just keeping track of who I group with myself.  If you're an asshole or you suck, you go on the list.  Bad Apples alerts you whenever someone on you list is around.
---
Of course you need to work, but you don't have to work 40-50 even 60 hours a week as some people do. What's the point of doing that? You'll earn lots of money sure, but when are you gonna spend it?
---
Also I don't think you should let anyone dictate what we as a species are built for. Society's norms tell us that we should produce babies and buy stuff, but you don't have to do that. Live your own life.
---
Sounds like an exploit then
---
Careful, I "was an idiot" and "must have never played Vanilla" for saying something similar.
---
Yeh, the MT in my guild was most often Fury/Prot specced, not deep prot. Deep prot is more for offtanks whose threat is less important.
---
Show me one single instance of that happening
---
Well enough received.  Rey is a fucking Mary Sue, Kylo isn't a compelling villain, etc..  But there was some cool stuff too.  There was a lot of plot potential coming out of TFA, right until TLJ shit the bed.
---
Again, who doesnt play BGs during leveling? 
---
Holy Pally is crazy good in battle grounds at any level. 
---
If you like PvP, dont gimp your fun in BGs by using a "leveling" spec. 
---
I dont really know how to spell it out any simplier than that.
---
No organized PvP at launch.
---
They have a release date of TBD.
---
Well in theory, 305 skill gives 1.2% hit, 0.2% Crit, and 0.2% anti-dodge.
---
Kind of unfortunate that an expansion as good as MoP has the same rating as WoD..
---
In the early phases, bear tank generates way more threat than a warrior. Warriors need better gear to scale their abilities. Once warriors gear up, bear tanks become much less useful. You'll also have to put in more effort on consumables and farming manual crowd pummelers to stay relevant. You should check out Skarm on YouTube,  he's a master druid tank.

I'm a chemist.  Energy drinks are really bad for your metabolism and overall metabolic well being. Having a huge spike of caffeine and artificial sweeteners or sugar is not good on your system.
---
There are two main arguments.
---
The developer resources are finite and they need to prioritize. They have possible TBC if classic works out, and 1.13+. As a company they need to look at lowest risk with the least amount of resources. TBC is a clear winner as 1.13 would require a lot of designing and so forth.
---
Secondly what are the chances that the current team is capable to "stay true" to the original design in the 1.13+. A lot of folks simply don't have faith and TBC was good so why not satisfy half your fans instead of rolling on a chance to piss off everyone. 
---
Noone is against 1.13+, ppl just don't believe in Blizz and TBC is a sure thing.
---
&gt; Druids will make more usage of a reduced Tranquility Cooldown than Hurricane CDR
---
Not really, no. Druid T1 is hot garbage for all specs. The stats are all over the place (mix of spell damage and healing) and literally every single piece is worse than preraid BIS. The only reason you ever use T1 is for casting Thorns, for the damage/duration increase you get from the 3-piece.
---
indeed

Yup. I'm sticking 100% to what I said. Insisting on playing the game wrong hampers other people's fun. It's just plain old rude :D

There was always something going on.  Chat was brain cell destroying, but always active and sometimes good for a laugh, shout outs for dungeon runs, attacks on the Crossroads, it was a great zone if you were Horde and looking for something to do in the level range.
---
Sadly no, i love Bgs so much.
---
Agreed
---
It was a better MMO than every other version of WoW, even with said flaws.
---
That's the one Payo bought huh?
---
It will always start at 40 yards if the hunter starts the fight. And a hunter has the tools like trap, to make a fight that started close extend to 40 yards. Many classes in fact have NO gap closing ability. Priest, warlocks, Paladins. No shaman is gunna cast ghost wolf to catch you, it takes 3 seconds.. warrior intercept range is 30 yards, how do they magically make up the 11 yard distance advantage you have? Rogues, Druids, mages, are the only ones with a chance to gap close. And that’s where being a skilled hunter comes into play, by knowing how to kite.
---
Currently 4:02 EST and its not online. WTF
---
No it wasn't.
---
Group finder during wotlk was perfectly fine and the social aspect of the game was fantastic and the raiding scene was extremely healthy with 10 man nhc/hc, 25 man hc/nhc alowing all sorts of guilds.
---
ToS.
---
&gt; That's the thing though, WoW means virtually nothing to their profit line and that's the reason they keep trying to choke WoW out of existence.
---
And despite WoW meaning virtually nothing to their profit line they are coming out with Classic. As someone that currently plays retail as the challenge of mythic progression is fun for me. Outside of that content there is very little I really do on WoW honestly and I am thoroughly looking forward to Classic (as are many of my friends and current/former guildmates spread across a variety of highly ranked US guilds). Blizzard has 100% lost touch with the core values that made World of Warcraft great for the last 15 years (not Vanilla, not BC, all of WoW in its entirety) in BFA. 
---
With that said; anyone who thinks that they are choking WoW out of existence intentionally is delusional. Don't assume malice when the result of a decision can be easily traced back to incompetence and stupidity. They changed so many things in hopes that they would break the wheel (ie: reducing the talent trees from huge trees to small rows of talents) they ended up breaking one wheel and over the years since they have managed to make an entirely new wheel out of the ruins of the old one.
---
A/B is a multi-billion dollar company. They aren't cutting WoW devs in order to pay some guy to add more MTX to Candy Crush Saga 12 or whatever the fuck it is now. Most cuts they have made were trimming the fat within the company that were hired unnecessarily. It sucks, I have friends that were attached to both the WoW and Overwatch teams but at the end of the day that is business and it happens.
---
&gt; And the candy bar analogy isn't really true since a candy bar wont have any influence on the game's economy at all while buying gold actually does, which is okay for modern WoW titles but the economy in Classic would make buying gold pretty much Pay2Win.
---
You do understand that tokens don't suddenly poof gold into existence, right? You buy a token, go to the AH, sell the token and it sells once someone buys a token and yours gets picked (presumably in the order that they are listed). Buying tokens has no influence whatsoever on the inflation of currency within the game.
---
Whether I hold my 10,000,000 gold or you hold my 10,000,000 gold there is very little economic difference there. It is no different than buying gold from a gold farmer except the fact that you 100% can not be scammed and rather than a random person making the real money it is Blizzard.
---
If anything I would be more concerned about the Pay2Win aspect of gold farmers on the economy in Classic than original Vanilla or the token on live solely due to the fact that many people returning to the game from when they were younger have far more disposable income in their mid to late 20s and early 30s as opposed to when they were 10-16 years old in 04-05.
---
Gold or real money, one of those is against TOS and will get you banned real fast.
---
But...Deathwing didn't destroy Northrend and Outland. Northrend I could maybe see, as it's on Azeroth. But Outland is another planet.
---
I see this a lot too. When people talk about leveling alts they always say skip BC. But it was always one of my favorite places to level. Even now I always go through BC questing instead of wotlk
---
it's all fun and games untill you spend 5 hours doing a dungeon or can't beat a boss
---
Group finder during wotlk was perfectly fine and the social aspect of the game was still great. The raiding scene was extremely healthy with 10 man nhc/hc, 25 man hc/nhc alowing all sorts of guilds to do content however they want. Small guilds, big guilds, didn't matter
---
If you got that impression from his title, then you lack basic reading comprehension that you should've learned in 3rd grade. You obviously dont have the mental capacity for anything other than scratching your nutsack and rolling undead rogue.
---
That sounds like you would get banned
---
Yes, they announced plans to make it work about 3 weeks ago and started the work about 3 days ago, though right now the focus is on Auctioneer, not Gatherer.
---
It absolutely did
---
Personally think BFA isn’t as bad as everyone makes it out to be and that Pandaria was INCREDIBLE. Easily my second fav expansion after Wrath.
---
&gt; is there a way to do this in a simple macro i can copy paste at luanch?
---
no. settings like that are not macroable.
---
We autorun, get into menu, select auto loot. set cam distance. Turn on all actionbars, etc.
---
Do something in game, then autorun a bit more.
---
/m and paste macros we have in a word doc
---
Etc.
---
Hunter is strong vs rogues but what you are getting here is mostly dueling advice at 60. 
---
While leveling:
---
You won't reach important talents for a long time
---
You wont find too many rogues around your level
---
If you find one and get an opener, they ARE NOT going to run to you like idiots while you kite them. they will fuck off and maybe come back 2 min later to get the opener on you. Without deep Surv talents and with the deadzone, you will not enjoy it. And they'll trinket your trap.
---
Finally at 60, after a few months, the only thing that'll matter is gear.
---
Seriously though, rogues are hard to find in the open world. tracking won't help you. And no rogue with a brain will fight a hunter if they don't have the opener. Sprint, Vanish, Adios. You are literally trying to hunt a class that most of the time isn't seen, and can almost all the time blow CDs and gtfo if you do.
---
As for all classes, if there is a level difference the gear / talents / skill start to matter very little.
---
good luck I guess
---
I don’t understand the problem if the gear is obtainable to everyone. Isn’t increasing your character’s power one of the main points of an MMO?
---
Warlock. Between dots and a pet should be super easy to never die.
---
It's fine guys there are ways around it.  You're going to be paid in cryptocurrency.
---
Are you serious? Man... You should talk about it with someone
---
It didn't matter at the time because wotlk was fantastic. The following epxansions were simply shit. Dungeon finder in wotlk didn't start ruiining or ruin anything. Entire expansions being absolute garbage ruined the game
---
Dude fuck off with that attitude, I'm sure you'll find like minded people to play with and so will I. It's just a game man.
---
You can only carry multiple idiots through easy content. After a certain point all 40 people need to contribute.
---
The accounts of people who carry will get banned. Someone will make a Video and post. GG
---
well, so you are aware, sharding has always been on a per zone basis on wow and not per continent.  you could be in azsuna watching a person flying next to you and when you entered val'sharah they would stop being present in your world.  it also made for some other annoyances.  the fact they derrived layering from sharding with the restricting of players being part of the same realm would mean by association have always had an opportunity to layer or shard each zone individually.
---
fuck wod, it was not underappreciated, it was shit.
---
Yea like I wasn’t even that good. Never cleared BWL. But we still got our ony buff before we did ony and Mc for the week.
---
As much as it was a "fresh raid" mythic high maul was insanely fun as a healer because with the low tier gear, your mana management was one of the most important factors. And there were a lot more "rot" fights vs "oopse we fucked up, now you're instantly dead".
---
It's more of an argument for a DKP systems in general, but EPGP provides more data than the majority of other DKP systems. You readily know how much someones contributed (depending on how well you've setup awarding EP) and how much gear a person has received. 
---
Often, I see loot councils that don't track any empirical data. These almost always end up with favoritism issues or uneven distributions of loot. Tracking something like attendance is better than nothing, but still inadequate imo. When a loot discussion happens, it needs to start from a source of unbiased data and the more the better. It allows decisions to be made easier and faster and ultimately more justified.
---
The more objectively justified a loot decision is, the less drama there is.
---
Your trolling really isn’t funny. None of your dumb posts are.
---
GDKP runs are always fun, but OP is a low effort troll.
---
You are not forced to do anything lol
---
Keep adding in raids and you make other raids pointless. You can’t just up the ilvl and have the best gear drop from raids while everyone else in the world is stuck at vanilla level 60 gear and you’re tier 7 and still level 60. Just thinknfor a second.
---
He said it was too much, which means it was unintended.
---
Best of twinking  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MOBZziLyRc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MOBZziLyRc) \- 29twinks take over BRM
---
Hey we bought our tickets before they announced the test, we’re not to blame for this one!
---
As standalone films TLJ is actually a better movie than TFA, the reason it's a bad movie though is because it took all the plot points of TFA and threw them in the trash. TFA is just an unimaginative remake of Ep4
---
After learning about GDKP from preacher drama time I think it is the best system.
---
Yeah, same thing I meant.  I just didn't know the term.  Sharding was a term from Ultima Online where the lore was that you broke the stone containing Britannia and created a bunch of shards of replica worlds.  Man, how I'd like some Ultima Online: Classic servers to come up...
---
maybe on a pve server it would work but a pvp server would be a nightmare for anyone trying to level/gear a fresh 60 if the power spike was even more significant
---
Blizzard banned an entire raid team in Retail when they discovered one person on the team had received IRL payments for the carry even though the rest had no idea.
---
Yeah, you're gonna get banned.
---
What needs to happen is when you do a transfer from Vanilla to TBC you now have 2 versions of your character...and so on and so forth.
---
Blizzard can have 4 different content creation teams.
---
You can't tell me that a game with 75 million dollars a month income cant field a few more content teams.
---
Play hunter for the first tier or two, then switch to another character. Having a geared hunter makes farming gold really, really easy and if you're willing to spend money on a second account you can quickly tab-level yourself to 60.
---
"FireFox for iOS does not currently support add-ons"
---
Fug
---
This isn't a bug. The servers are not up.
---
Ah, for the beta? 
---
I would really focus on getting her greater magic wand. Greater magic wand is by far the strongest thing about a level 13 priest. IF they are not on the auction house (stress test beta ecoomy), you can very much just power through to them with tailoring and enchanting. 
---
In terms of talents, 5/5 wand spec and then 1 point in something else is going to be real strong.
---
Haha I meant on the stress test servers. But that is also very true lol
---
Fuck up once in farm runs with good players/guilds for whatever reason (as in, royal fuck up that was more than just an accident) or play garbage specs that keep people down (1/6th dps of an actual dps spec) and you will quickly find yourself in groups full of absolute scrubs only as guilds tend to talk to one another.
---
I believe there has to be a reasonable group of people who want to know their /played investment doesn’t have to end as soon as they have every piece of Naxx gear.
---
sorry if this is old news but my launcher is fucked up and this suddenly appeared and i didnt see anything else posted about it so i thought id share :)
---
this isn't a bug, literally everyone has this.
---
look at the subreddit before you post new topics.
---
How can a rogue close the gap? Sprint? Ok. Scatter. Trap. Cheetah.. rogue dead
---
How can a warrior close the gap? Charge? Ok.
---
See above. 
---
How can a mage close the gap? Blink? Ok.
---
Same damn thing. Have you never played a hunter or are you just blabbering? Kiting with cheetah is literally the bread and butter of a good hunter. Concussion shot, scatter shot, well placed traps... you may get dazed here and there are so many counters to getting people off your dick.
---
There’s a difference between “tryhard (an insult I never understood) speedruns” and not taking non-viable builds into group content.
---
But hey, have fun.
---
BC was nothing like classic.
---
- It introduced flying.  
---
- Even though it began with attunements, they were all essentially removed later in the expansion and they never came back.  Sunwell was the first major raid to not have an attunement of any kind.  
---
- It introduced short, "loot hallway" style dungeons as the standard format.  
---
- It introduced resilience into PvP.  
---
- It introduced the concept of badge gear.  
---
- It introduced daily ~~chores~~ quests.  
---
- It removed the concept of faction-specific classes.  
---
- It introduced the concept of a neutral main city.
---
Many of these shitty design decisions persist in the game in some form or another to this day.
---
During the weekend they locked us out of our lvl 40's realm and opened a different realm. On that new realm, all characters created started at lvl 58 and were locked to that lvl. We also could only Q for AV because if we left the city limits, it automatically teleported us back to the BattleMaster.
---
Right, even if we are, we dont have an extradition treaty with the USA, so it's a moot point.
---
A shortened version of your title to make it more obvious that it's clickbait:
---
Ex-Dev On Molten Core, E3, World Buffs, &amp; Stream Sniping
---
and literally everything else was terrible. That doesn't make the whole expansion "fantastic". Legion was overall much better
---
Noteworthy that disc is no longer a meme spec on AQ progression onwards, firemage, especially the ignite one, with power infusion = cum all over the boss.
---
So my friend lost his account because he forgot his email and it was a hotmail one. Is there another way to recover his account if he can’t remember the handle of that email?
---
I see where you’re coming from but with all due respect I truly disagree, but that’s fine, agree to disagree.
---
Do you have any advice for Mages trying to AoE farm in Maraudon? Specifically, how to get the Scepter quickly.
---
Lol that shit isn't true. Don't believe this new narrative about how people back in the day didn't know anything about the game. People used World buffs frequently in Vanilla, they just never relied on them for every raid because they were unnecessary, time-consuming, and un-fun to lose.
---
Our guild killed Nef with Ony + ZG + DM buffs back in 2005. One of my Human guildies farmed stealth tribute runs and got bought an epic tiger before most people had their first epic mount.
---
My bad for not have a chronological memory of the content of someones podcast. Check the previous time Satrunalia was a guest? Check the first week of beta?
---
No RPPVP  everyone freak out !!
---
Oh yeah. It has it's limits, but I love it.
---
Yes that's pretty much exactly the point. Sharding is per zone, and layering isn't. Not much of a difference between the two apart from that really.
---
No but that was the start of a slippery slope that led to the era of convenience we live in today. That doesnt take anything away from wrath as an expansion, nobody is saying it did. (if they are you can kindly disregard their opinion)
---
If they kept the original server names, it would give returning players the opportunity to possibly reconnect with (or avoid) old friends (or foes).
---
That's fine, I have a friend that is a GM that can just unban us.
---
It's just players not realizing how strong they are cause apparently everyone uses naxx estimates to judge classes , eventually people will realize what early /late game classes are.
---
&gt; No, it suggests if you're in defensive stance it wont switch, the two are very different 
---
You're right... It won't switch, and my point is that's ok.  If I'm in stance:2, it's probably for a good reason, and I'd rather stay with whatever main hand/off hand I have and perform the action.  That's the whole point of the 1st /cast command.
---
What you helped me realize is that later in my macro, it would switch to my 2H anyway... and I didn't want that if the 1st /cast was successful... meaning I AM in a Group, and I AM in stance:2 and I'd like to stay with a 1H and Shield.
---
In the 2nd /cast, I don't care about my stance since I'm not in a group, and I'll just use the ability as long as I have a 2H equipped (and stance dance as I normally do outside of the macro).
---
Ultimately, this macro type is more geared for soloing and weaving different abilities that require different stances to use, and different weapon combos to maximize damage.  If i don't have to swap out the macro for when I group, it's a bonus.
---
&gt; Flying is more or less fine.
---
Fuck flying.
---
No, he said "collecting all the buffs was too much work".
---
&gt;I really hope they don’t let this be a thing or it will be kind of a let down.
---
It is a thing. 8 weeks until launch, that means what is current is what is going to be released. Even if they wanted too, they won't patch it in time... but I guarantee you that they don't want to fix it in the first place.
---
&gt; That was a whole lot of text only to add nothing useful to the conversation. 
---
You must be replying to yourself then.
---
Never played enh to be honest. Don't know about the totem management though:-D
---
Increase the honor gear as well? Aside from that, why are these sad fuck 60’s stuck in their fresh 60 gear. Are they unable to raid?
---
You’ve changed it from what I wrote to make it seem more click baitey? I’m not following as that’s not what I wrote? I know what you’re going for here, but if that’s not what I wrote, then how does it take us anywhere?
---
Brave browser :^)
---
Makes perfect sense and this approach really sounds great!  Thanks for the detailed information!
---
Yeah, WoD was awful, these are some heavy rose tinted glasses for sure.
---
You sir, are rude.
---
No. Once there are more than 10~ people are on the blacklist it gets pretty much ignored. Can’t fit a thousand memespec players on that. The toxic tryhards in this subreddit are just trying to scare vanilla newbies.
---
What?! No. Nor did I ever say that. If you read what I said before, we only had a bunch of meme specs like rets, boomkins, ect, on our fun nights. Usually wednesday and Thursday.
---
I can’t wait to ninja the majordomo chest in MC hopefully it isn’t changed.
---
ah rip ok
---
Dual monitors. It's so convenient to have a spreadsheet on the other screen, for keeping important information to hand, like "Do I need to do this lead in quest before showing up at this zone or miss out on a major quest chain", along with "what items do I need to acquire and save for later", or "My bracers are terrible, where's a good quest to replace them". 
---
I don't actually feel wow needs a large screen at all. I am on a 27 inch monitor and I feel like I could safely go down like 6 inches (though I of course won't as 27 inchers are very cheap these days), but I really recommend trying to have a second monitor for being able to reference stuff without tabbing out.
---
Has blizz said this?
---
Ohhhhh, is he a troll by any chance? In that case great idea you hit jackpot.
---
this tbh
---
Fuck you sound cool.
---
99% chance it will happen. The no life pserver guilds that want to pull it off are recruiting 100+ no life speed levellers so that they will have as high a chance as possible to get a full raid team by the end of the week. I suspect they will also have dedicated warlocks for summoning people to major areas which would shave hours off of everyone’s levelling time.
---
To be honest I really don't see any connections between this thread and wowclassic. You just looking for new monitors
---
It's fine. I believe you. I just like the narrative that you are a troll in game and irl lol. Srsly though thanks for the podcast!
---
And with Feral, you mean cat?
---
The only thing I dislike with druids is their lack of a regular rezz
---
&gt; How can a rogue close the gap? 
---
What gap? Rogue starts in stealth. 
---
&gt;Ok. Scatter. Trap.
---
Frost reflector. Where is your god now?
---
&gt;How can a mage close the gap? Blink? Ok. Same damn thing.
---
Mage has 2 ice blocks and trinket, only a bad mage loses to a Hunter.
---
&gt;Have you never played a hunter or are you just blabbering?
---
I have, quite a bit.
---
Objective facts about TBC:
---
you guys from the twitch generation are sad creatures......  The rest of us just waits and will be happy to jump in once it gets eventually launched.
---
I was going to research this myself, thanks for posting both together in one comment!
---
Sharding basically works the same, everything is crossrealm, which is sharding, before there was only cross realm, now sharding is the new cross realm except its dynamic
---
That is the accepted theory crafted formula however the results pulled from beta show &gt;.2% per skill point. Granted their isn’t enough data to say either way. I shouldn’t go against it but I like the even round numbers. .4% sounds better than between .2% and .4%.
---
1440p is great. Not too fussed about ultra wide. 144hz 1440p will be the best for it.
---
It's not without flaws but I really enjoyed WoD. To each their own
---
I’m going to ninja loot the majordomo chest in MC first chance I get.
---
When I was young, I used to believe that most people were smart, sensible, decent folks, like almost everyone I knew. Then the Internet happened.
---
Yeah, if you have no job and farm like it is a full time job to pull dps inferior to good dps classes.
---
Still a meme, it does not compare. Better than usual ret, but usual ret is tank dps.
---
There aren’t too many catch up mechanics/gear in classic. If you make a raid their after naxx, the power gap might be too huge and it could make pvp unenjoyable for most. 
---
Let’s just wait a few months after classic is out and see how the population is before we talk about added more content. It might not even be worth it for the devs
---
I, for one, am shocked that OP posts to the donald.
---
you really must not know what you're talking about then because if you Google search transcribed podcast there are many of them that have their transcriptions up freely available.
---
The 1-60 and 5-10 man dungeons should be really fun as a Druid.  For raiding it's mostly healing, unless your group or raid is fine with hybrid specs or druid OT.
---
Good. 
---
Warlock was the only class I played, from 1-10, that had nearly zero down time and did not struggle compared to others. 
---
Hunters, for example, get a couple of shots off before they are in the dead zone. Then they are melee boys for half the fight. They have difficulties dealing with more than one mob. 
---
Mages get about 3 kills before they are oom and have to drink. 
---
Warlock can dot up a mob, sic his imp on it, ***and walk to the next*** without stopping or having to worry about dying. 
---
It gets easier when you get fear. Nearly no downtime and really one of the only classes that allow you to dot and walk as you run to the next area without you really slowing down. 
---
Give it a shot when you get a chance to play. 
---
It slows down when you get to lvl 12 or so. Can’t go as fast. Still it’s by far the best leveling class from 1-10.
---
You'll notice my post was about BFA servers and not Classic. So your comment, while true, doesn't apply to what I was saying.
---
I mean, higher refresh rate and pixel density are desirable in a general sense. Size to one's taste. Imo for a game like Classic you don't lose out on anything really, with a 1080p 60Hz.
---
Have a second monitor tho, very handy.
---
Same here. Nelf shadowmeld and flips were so fun. Although in the cinematics I thought the Dwarf with a bear was so super cool... ahhhh!
---
Leveling as tauren is very simple. 
---
The quests from 1-5 are so easy and not much running involved. 5-10 little more tedious but when you hit 10 you can walk right to xroads and keep the momentum going.
---
Every server had their own board on the WoW forums. My RP server had forum drama constantly. And YTMND memes.
---
yeah man, Josh is an amazing host. He also puts out 2.5 hours of content a week? Its crazy
---
Yeah his name is Trollgodx, he has awesome GM Powers like teleportation.
---
I think people might have forgotten that 60-70 was a damn slog, even when it was new. Sure, the first handful of times is not so bad, especially when it is relevant, but after Wrath, it was so incredibly hard to motivate yourself through that content.
---
You could probably bring an entire raid of meme specs and you'd still not struggle.
---
The invisible penalty is completely separate from the hit cap and blizzard clarified as such. With 300 skill you need 9% hit even though you only miss 8%. 5 weapon skill drops it to 6%.
---
the game was new at that time. ppl were overall way worse then the biggest noobs you see today. in classic gear &gt; skill for certain classes. warriors were one of them. tehy didnt need any skill (well ok they needed a little but less then other classes) only healers and gear. 2 shotting ppl requires no skill
---
Northeast Philly :)
---
Tank specs are very bad in the open world. 
---
Because of the proposed time between phases, most people will have time to level a mage alt to farm for their tank warrior to respec and repair.  It’s just not great to farm even with a DPS warrior spec, and a warrior meant for tanking will have engineering, which isn’t great for making money.
---
And yes prot paladins don’t produce enough threat, there’s not much more to add.
---
You can see what the result is. Server community is disregarded. It becomes more about the individual, than the community. Players end up spam queues all day, and potentially ignore their own server community. If you have long battleground queue, then go do something else. Nonstop instant gratification is what crossrealm BGs deliver. It will hurt Classic. Battlegrounds are not going to be how many remember during Classic This instant queue mentality is why the community died in this game.
---
You want to add more? First it was just add more raids. Now we have to increase honor gear as well?
---
They are unable to raid because the top guilds on their servers are doing tier 8 and they just hit 60 and with zero reason to go back and to molten core, guile’s will die. 
---
This is the same thing that happen in TBC. Guild progress got separated and smaller guilds died.
---
That never happened. When MC was BiS arms was the top warrior dos spec as fury wouldn’t get fixed until a few patches on.
---
I remember UC not having one. But it was added eventually.
---
Also hopefully people will remember that pvp power is not the same as raid dps. A mage might top meters with frosrbolt spam but they cant do that safely in pvp. Same for a rogues calculated rotation. Pvp is a whole different game
---
Already got further than the last 2 stress test windows combined.
---
ah ok, I don't watch streams or follow the news except for tidbits here on this reddit, thanks for the heads up
---
Always been a fan of felhunter. IIRC, you can use Devour Magic not only on hostiles, but also on yourself/party members. Having a dispell/debuffer can be excellent when timed well.
---
Sure like Belize is going to hold somebody accountable for copyright law, there's plenty of stuff written in the books that's never going to be enforced and that's one of them.

A lot of players who haven't played locks in classic are planning to roll one, you can be sure that a lot will change their minds once they realize how tedious the class is.
---
Rank 1 binding integration, sequence of spells, understanding exactly what you need to do if your opponent reacts in a certain way. It's basically a game knowledge question, similar to how many other classes operate in PvP. Vanilla is very much call-and-response based PvP, so you need to know what your best response is to enemy calls.
---
&gt; Stealth? Laughs in flare. I can wait.
---
Lol what... this isn't how world pvp goes. You won't know the Rogue is even there until he's on you.

Except your scatter only lasts 4 seconds and he's meleeing you.

&gt; Every mage is specced cold snap? Good to know.

Pop a fap too and spam Arcane Explosion. He'll outdps you.
---
&gt;and because he was friends with her and they were in the same department he kicked me. 
---
Well just report that and they'll fire him.
---
The only undere appreciated imho opinon on thatc astegory can be considered the pandarian expansion
---
I want to start this comment off by saying I've read your other comments in the thread and I think you are reasonable and intelligent. We just disagree. Take this for an example. Let's say once raiding gets full swing in classic one would assume streamers would be apart of a guild that regularly raids at scheduled days and times throughout the week. Let's say a guild decides, every week, to start their raid just before the streamers and their activity for the first half hour of their raid is to ambush the streamers raid. 
---
It would be very simple to wait at the entrance to MC/BWL in creative locations and surprise attack the streamers raid as they tried to get to the entrance killing everyone in the process, messing up world buffs, raid start times and corpse camping random players that can't corpse hop far enough.  This could be completely disastrous for the raid/guild being unable to start on time or efficiently. Is this griefing? Collectively the guild stopped hours of potential progress if they killed each player and delayed everyone only 5 minutes 5x40=200 minutes. Hell, they could completely derail the raid. Now add that to the fact that they could do that every raid. Is it a massive waste of time for the streamers guild, absolutely. Is it unsporting, absolutely not.
---
It made many mistakes.
---
To name a few.
---
2 monitors or ultrawide in windowed. I prefer ultrawide but whatever floats your boat. WoW is as much about discord/forums/database website as it is the game itself so you need somewhere to put that stuff.

No Honor System at all for the first ~2 months.
---
No AV or WSG at all for the first ~4 months.
---
No AB at all for the first ~8 months.
---
Wotlk didn't introduce the new summomin stones, it didn't introduce flying, it didn't introduce the lfg interface panel and it didn'T remove the lfg chat.
---
That’s bullshit. Games need marketing, even good games. And marketing creates hype. 
---
You could make the best damn game in the world, without marketing or hype absolutely nobody would give a shit because nobody would know about it.
---
looks like we lost our old characters, rip.
---
I couldn’t disagree more as my whole guild / server had issues with the launch of BFA for the first 12 hours. Illidan, Horde. It was known BFA was a sloppy launch, hence the blue post about it with them acknowledging server authentication issues.
---
Mists was underappreciated in it's time. Cataclysm and Warlords.. no, they definitely deserve the hate they received.
---
That's actually really useful if you've been in any of the stress tests as its how you uninstall the StressTest client since that no longer shows up in the dropdown - I did this last night before I installed the "Live --&gt; WoW Classic" client
---
How on Earth could you NOT stop casting for 5 sec as Paladin ?
---
I play Paladin prot on a 1.12.x private server, and once you've cast Seal of the crusader - Judgement - Seal of Righteousness - Consecration on pull, then SoR - J - C you don't have much to do but wait for the next cycle. And since Judgement cooldown is 10s and seals last 30s there is always more than 5s to wait.
---
So yes, spirit is definitely needed for us pallys.
---
Maybe as Ret, with the 8s Judgement and the Consecration talent this should be considered, but I can't even be sure.
---
Never played Holy so I can't tell, but it definitely sounds weird not to seek for spirit as a healer.
---
This, exactly this. 
---
Blizzard had to search it's scrap warehouse for a 12 year old copy of wow source code. Import all the assets, and revamp the current engine to use the old code, and spend 1.5 years debugging all that so we can have Classic.
---
It's too large of an undertaking just for a me too project that will just sit there like the one populated vanilla server....
---
Blizz wants to give all those people playing on private servers a better experience if they are willing to pay for it.
---
&gt; If you tried to play Dungeons and Dragons in a way where the rogue and the wizard were equally powerful in all situations, you'd suck every bit of fun out of it.
---
Just ask 4th Edition.
---
Fire resist gear is only really needed on the main tank for Rag and even then you can adjust some buffs around, chug some pots, and mind control a mob in UBRS (I believe that's where he is, maybe BRD) that gives you a long lasting FR buff. So he only really needs a few pieces.
---
Definitely STV. It's nearly impossible to avoid, absolutely massive and right at that level range when you feel so close to mount and so far away, and it's constant fight for survival or kill the mob you started on to just finish the fucking quest.
---
Their jump animations are among the worst in the game imo.
---
But yea, their cast animations are bad ass.
---
Between all those classes, druid can stealth, which is great for going afk or when you are half paying attention.  Their healing and mobility make it hard to die as well.  I’m going druid for the same reasons.
---
Don't know what to tell you man, that's how we did it on my last guild on ND and everything worked out great. Player 2 just got one of the less desirable epic weapons in the coming weeks (I think the 1h axe off nef) since we had 2 more months of nothing but mc/bwl farm until AQ40 released. 
---
Also if giving good loot to players increases their chances of leaving for a better guild then I guess no one should get loot and we should just shard everything lol
---
Mana pots and Dark Runes don't magically fix all of those issues. That ~1800 mana for battle rez is the bare minimum that you should have available at all times. In reality, you should have more like 3k mana in reserves for battle rez + Innervate + off-healing + shifting back into cat form after each of those. That's your entire mana pool.
---
You can (and should) still powershift. Do it once at the start of a fight to let your natural regen from spirit start working. But you should not be powershifting often enough to make the Wolfshead Helm viable - at least not on progression. Which was my original point.
---
I love how there are still try-hards for a 15 year old *solved game*.  It's only the mediocre players too because the good players already beat the game and have nothing to prove.
---
Those people need to get a life.
---
I've been looking at the free sync model now that Nvidia cards work with it. It goes for about $300 regularly now. Unless some great deal on a different model comes along, that'll be the one I grab if I dont go ultrawide.

Being ugly on Reddit...............(you don't know how an ellipsis works) reported.
---
RotS was decent.  _Easily_ the best film in terms of lightsaber combat.
---
When you said “have the best gear drop from raids” I assumed it was a gripe on pvp only players being done a disservice. 
---
I’m not OP, but I agree. I say pick your poison: have everyone quit after they are in full naxx gear with fuckall to do or make it a little difficult for new players to find raid spots.
---
Was talking about holy not prot lmao
---
TLJ was generally poorly written. Tons of stuff simply doesn’t make sense when you think about it. TFA was fine not great but what it really did was set up so much more like you said. TFA has some great moments too that kinda made it stand out more then it maybe should.

---
Test doesnt start until 5 PM EST (2 PM PST)
---
&gt;Realms are up but locked (You can make characters).
---
Bit point... you can make THREE characters.
---
So looks like a test / confirmation of Aug 13 name reservation system.
---
It works. I could make 3 on the account.
---
I got "Mana" as a mage name and I'm way happier than I should be. I think my work day just ended.
---
The barrens, for the bantZ
---
Let’s table the issue for a couple months and come back to it once we’ve had some time for the new meta to shake out.
---
RP servers are the best place to make fun of RPers.
---
And only long enough to let the main user sleep for a bit.
---
Why do people comment when it's obvious that they have no idea what they are talking about. Why the hell would someone need to be extradited for a copyright issue lol.
---
Can sure, but should? They are still a company looking to max profits.
---
Classic is probably even better than WotLK for GDKP, especially with the identifiably of people. It just won't be great for rapid progression, like always.
---
WoD should've been the holiday special.
---
wider is better.
---
Also, looks like you can only make 2 characters.
---
You do know there can be more options right?
---
Why just assume one of the options is the game ends after naxx?
---
Would it be worth it to do darkshore to 16/17 then go westfall to do the chain quest for Head of VC, and later do a dm run for wep and chest/legs?
---
indeed, if you don’t have US game time it says “Active game time is required in order to play World of Warcraft: Classic (WOW51900331)”
---
WoD wasn’t under appreciated because it sucked. Cata and MoP weren’t under appreciated because they were well-loved (yeah they had their downs like introducing LFR in Cata and over a year of SoO in MoP, but overall pretty well loved).
---
Correct. I'm just letting y'all know you can go ahead and create your toons and pick your names.
---
it's a deep affliction talent that requires 5 points to get to 30% slow, if you add amplify curse to it ( 3 mins cd) it will finally get to 50% for 12 secs , there's no way a lock can reach a hunter if the hunter is actively trying to run away, hunter can outpace lock with stronger slow/cheetah and traps.
---
&gt; What about curse of exhaustion?
---
I just switched back to this tab after doing other things and immediately saw this and thought you were referring to some effect of trying to level too many alts at once. I forgot it was an ingame ability.
---
still showing Beta:world of warcraft classic   
---
without the play button being able to be pushed
---
Youre acting like a YouTuber with 2.5 thousand subscribers is going to have the power to make a copyright case happen in a different country.
---
But for all intents and purposes it's never going to be enforced so it really doesn't matter.
---
Big point... you can make THREE characters.
---
&gt; You're not in charge, stop acting like you are
---
I mean, not only do I think you missed my point, but that is kind of what I am asking of everyone here who somehow thinks they have to tell the OP how he is going to feel regardless of the fact he directly stated otherwise.
---
Gear. You can tell what someone has done based on what gear they have.
---
TLJ is not only the worst Star Wars, but one of the worst films I've ever seen period.  Blah blah my opinion blah blah.
---
As someone else suggested, just have an alt? Unless you genuinely think you only have time for one and will never get bored and want to play an alt.
---
Otherwise you might want to consider playing a druid. They don't have quite the same level of burst dps as a rogue but they can still gank very effectively and are hard to kill in world pvp to boot. You'll also be able to heal in end-game PvE. Actually, you'll be expected too most of the time
---
People looking for classic+ don't really want to play classic. They just want to play the current game with all the mistakes removed.
---
...because apparently you didn't understand that your title is clickbait? So I removed some of the clutter to help you see that it's clickbait.
---
Your actual title literally has the exact same effect. Your actual title is literally just as clickbaity, it's just longer. If you still can't see it, try this on for size, which is just the first part of your title, since the last part adds nothing:
---
* Ex-Dev On The Making of Molten Core, The Games of E3 That Will Battle Classic, World Buffs, &amp; Stream Sniping
---
The only guest you mention is the Ex-Dev. Your title heavily insinuates that he is there for the entire duration. And he is not. Hence the clickbait.
---
Hello there
---
If movement time was the biggest factor, warlock would be nowhere as close to hunter in level speed as they are.
---
I was able to make 3 each on different servers before receiving a notification it was the max per account.
---
I'm just going to randomize since I doubt the character will carry over to the August launch.
---
my launcher just shows beta:world of warcraft classic without the play button being able to be pushed.... doesnt say stress test though
---
Or rather, TBC and Wrath.
---
I don't know that much about BFA, but if it's as bad as TLJ, then it is truly lost.
---
So the servers arnt up.
---
As you point out, many state how easy it is and you'll get it by lvl 10. I think a lot of those guides are from pservers. I tested this early on Beta on UD Priest. I had to grind  a full level from 10-11 on Scarlet Friars and Zealots to get the 58 linen cloth. I don't think it will be that easy if you are competing for mobs at launch. If you are behind the curve, just get someone nice to make you one or sell you one.
---
I've found that MMOs benefit more from smaller (21"-27") monitors than most other types of games. Your play is filtered through your UI and so having everything tight and tidy within a screen that you can quickly assess is beneficial in some ways. There is a point where the screen gets too big for certain things to be done optimally. 
---
Ultrawide would be good for a PvE server and for people focused on immersion but arguably a detriment to PvP and high-end raiding since it ends up busying up an already cluttered screen with things you don't need to see. 
---
Said another way: MMOs are 40% UI, 60% world. It is arguably better to play them on smaller monitors. I believe competitive FPS players share this philosophy.
---
I find the system is more for pugs and semi casual groups with no commitments. Well you do need a core carry group.
---
You can make 3 chars per account so this stress test is including the 2 week early reservation stuff.
---
Good shit.
---
I made 3, but could not make 4, as expected.
---
go back to realm selection, got something hanging out somewhere else?
---
&gt; I mean, not only do I 
---
Let me stop you right there, this isnt about you FFS.
---
They're up. Can't enter world. Simple.
---
AdGuard will get the job done for Safari.
---
How do you know there won't be?
---
I could be wrong, but I remember hunters used to track humanoid not track stealth. I could be wrong about that but, I remember it tracking stealth just fine.
---
Hence why it should be removed for raids
---
Not Aux? Aux is so much better than Auctioneer.
---
Yes. The main challenge for MC is getting 40 players online and in the raid.
---
And if you don't listen to the podcast on YouTube how is he going to make all that clickbait ad revenue
---
Yeah not trying to be rude, but this isn’t going to happen. Classic will be classic. The only possibility is that eventually they decide to roll into TBC, but a lot of people don’t even want that. New content is always going to be focused into retail.
---
&gt; design a fight that requires 8 Druids
---
You mean every fight right?
---
BE GONE FOUL TROLL!
---
Tauren Resto Druid for me
---
Indeed. I got back into raiding in WoD after taking a break since wrath and I agree
---
That’s not up. 
---
“Hey you’re foodis up, you just can’t get it yet or eat it yet or see it”
---
that's not the point of this project
---
Love it! 💜
---
People won't bot just to get Battle.net balance that they can't cash out.
---
Yeah those are facts but the problem is you can't objectively say all those things are worse.  Slight flaw in your argument...  Some things like flying many people would agree were bad.  Resilience was great to me.  Badge gear wasn't bad for me but I could easily see people argue against this.  Removing faction specific classes can once again easily be argued that it was better for balance.  I'll also give you neutral main city.
---
adding new content would ruin classic  
---
everything up until that point would be rendered absolutely useless as the regular power creep advanced  
---
so... it's a great idea if you want classic to end
---
you are an idiot. sorry, pal.
---
Clearly I need to work there lol
---
freaks out the Gryphon too
---
The economy isn't the problem... it's the community and the immersion. Leveling and running into the same people is part of the joy of classic... when you take that away with "layers" it ruins the *most fun part of the game*. The community.
---
Absolutely not
---
Have you got a link from a blue saying this? The only information I could find was a blue confirming you can not get TCG loot in Classic
---
Maybe that's because you are a total dick on reddit. Self promotion is okay if you can deal with those atrocious downsides such as tl:dl and such.
---
You know it! 😉
---
i'm aware of all that, i'm just wondering how much of this theorycrafting is from before we know about the 1% penalty, where the formulas they "discovered" might have been taking the penalty into account without actually realizing they were (since it was unknown at the time)
---
i guess something like a history or timeline of wow theorycrafting is what i'm looking for, but i'm sure a lot of that info has been lost to time.
---
You take that back right now. Dwarfs look amazing end game.
---
I have "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic", but it's telling me "You can't play WoW Classic yet."
---
 Yeah I saw 2 pacific
---
If you are basing it on the numbers someone else who is biased told you from private servers, you should know they kind of had a pretty significant fuck up on those. Enh shaman dps is not as bad as private servers made it out to be.
---
Classic Realm 14 [represent](https://imgur.com/a/bweKcbU)
---
odd i downloaded the update a few days ago and i was in the last stress test.
---
There should not? They didn't exist in vanilla.
---
I really loved Cata and MoP. 
---
WoD onward was when the game completely get different to me and has never been the same since.
---
Whichever of you bastards took my name I am going to hunt you down and corpse camp you for a week straight. I know this is just the test servers but how dare you.
---
Filthy neutrals
---
How long is 1-15 taking in Classic for a few different classes you've tried?
---
Someone else in this thread mentioned sending a picture of their photo ID, but I’m really not sure
---
lol I know, pal. 
---
don't be sorry, just take a damn hike, buck.
---
Haha, it does kind of look like that. Believe it or not, that's just the PA letter 'O'
---
&gt;Cross server? Like cross server Battlegrounds?
---
You're trolling if you're equating Cross server BGs to cross server matchmade PVE. Cross server BGs are bad, but so limited in scope that the impact they have on a game is minuscule compared to other cross server shit.
---
&gt;It wasn't a disaster
---
Yeah man, why would you wanna do a bunch of different raids every week when you could do the same raid 4 times? Who wouldn't want to kill the final boss of a raid time 5 times on joke difficulties before they get to fight it on a challenging difficulty. Who wouldn't want wildly inflated stats leading to retardedly huge damage/health numbers because each tier needs 3 or 4 levels of gear?
---
&gt;Wotlk had some of the best balancing in pve and pvp in the entire history of the game.
---
Oh, you're just trolling. GJ, you got me lmao
---
The more you know!
---
Uhh a hunter should never lose to a rogue dude. I seriously doubt you’ve played a hunter with comments like this. Frost reflect last what 5 seconds? Wait, and then trap. Get distance, and dead rogue. 
---
Mage is a skill matchup. In a duel the mage should win. But with kiting room a hunter should win. Mages can’t catch you. Blink is only 20 yards you start at 41. You simply scatter once they blink and buy yourself an extra few seconds to get max range again. If they iceblock your scatter, you still gained about 2 seconds, you wait for their fireblast, then turn on cheetah. A good mage will try to get a rank 1 frostbolt in, you may outrange it, if you don’t no biggie.. toggle cheetah off, use your PvP trinket, cheetah back on.. get max range... dead mage.
---
Would give me chills!
---
People didn't calm down in vanilla, OBVIOUSLY you never played it if you think otherwise. /s
---
It should be under the live drop down- it's not the beta.
---
I was a vanilla player at launch, and had played the RTS games as a kid.  I can confirm that basically everyone who was familiar with the Warcraft IP was excited for when the portal would open.  I'm not sure if we knew it would be an xpac, we might have thought it would just be a content patch, but we knew the portal would have to open.  It's like Chekhov's Gun.
---
Well you're claiming against what almost every pserver hardcore druid player has theory crafted and shown. Now I know what you're gonna say "pserver, blah blah DPS is different blah blah" but the values of shapeshifting, mana pot regen, dark runes regen, mana spring totem, mana flask, etc etc, are all completely blizzlike. 
---
The DPS loss on abilities and white damage by equipping say Furors (The phase 1 BiS) over Wolfshead is pitiful but the DPS gain from the 20 energy every shapeshift is quite high more than half a shred every shapeshift and contrary to what you're trying to suggest, druids have been showing the sustainability of powershifting with Wolfshead for quite a while now.
---
The shapeshift gain is so good that the helm was BiS even into TBC. That's how little you lose, T6 helm is objectively worse than the Wolfshead because that 20 energy gain makes up more than the difference very quickly.
---
It's easy to gas you inside and camp the entrance though.
---
They never assumed people would raid log their mains to keep them up, removing a huge chunk of population from the server that has access to raid only patterns and recipes
---
It is hard compared to retail now. You can get a taste of it in time walking right now. Mobs hit for larger proportions of HP - you can even see this in patch notes over the last several years specifically pointing out that they have been making efforts to reduce spike damage in encounters.
---
Dungeons in vanilla assume a much more deliberate approach, which includes specialization and access to tank-specific skills. You can work around the lack of them, but that adds more complications and points of failure. If you're going to tank anything but lower-third trivial instances, you need to be built and geared for that role unless you just like making things more difficult on your team.
---
Simple google searches tho

---
You realize that the Battle.net client and Windows itself is as much spyware as Discord, right?
---
I assure you, Attack of the Clones was not underappreciated. It's even worse than you remember. All that potentially saves it is the retroactive humour applied by modern-day memes.
---
Plinkett was right that it is literally the worst thing created by a human.
---
Season 8 of Game of Thrones had the most viewership.
---
Wrath and MoP were my favorite times in WoW, and I have them as a tie as far as my play time and most fun i had in the game. I didnt really play much in Vanilla or TBC though so I am basically a Wrath baby 😂
---
That is a great example, and perfectly describes my point about not all situations are equal. IMO what you described would not be griefing as this is something that a lot of guilds experience, streamers or not. Streamers are instead broadcasting and providing an advantage to others to specifically target them. However, where do you draw the line? What is the exact definition? It’s definitely a tricky situation... If I was a GM my solution to that specifically would be to tell them to deal with it as they are deciding to provide the advantage to others, and they can start their stream when they’re in the instance. Not easy to solve tho.
---
Just take skinning/lw on the hunter and put enchanting on your bank alt
---
are you on eu?
---
Isn't the stress test today available to anyone with an active sub?

Ion is quoted saying a lot of things that never came to be. Don't trust anything about layering.

This is the mindset of 'i want gear' rather than 'i want fun'.

What is the difference between 1 4-hour AV, and 4 1-hour AVs?
---
4x the BG rewards...
---
I think it was 1.9
---
Totally disagree, 
---
I got a write up at work once because I checked in somewhere on Facebook when I went home sick at mid day.
---
I checked in because they ordered something for my wife and beat the shit out of it loading it in her car. She called me an I checked in so I’d get a review prompt. Because they don’t answer their damn phones. 
---
2 weeks later I got a write up for not being a team player leaving them to get fucked for the day. I’m on phones at work and had bronchitis with a doctors note for 4 days off. Even if I had gone to that store it wouldn’t have mattered. I had no voice. 
---
Point is work assholes are petty 
---
Second point is Fuck IKEA !
---
As somebody who RP'd in WoW from TBC to WoD I gave up on the idea that people will see my character as I want to see them.
---
Hint: they won't.
---
Yeah, the story justification for the revamped content was Deathwing's attack. But they did more than just set all the zones on fire; they completely reworked most of the zones, quests, etc. to change the way leveling feels. Since Outlands and Northrend didn't get that same rework, the 60-80 content is now older and doesn't feel the same as the 1-60 content.
---
There's only three 27" 1440p FreeSync monitors that are compatible with Nvidia cards and only the Acer XG270HU is cheaper than the Dell. It's flimsy as fuck and has no stand adjustments, plus you lose out on Variable Overdrive.
---
Shammies and palas will always be the most played healers ,they're the most demanded healers in raids, i thought everyone knew that :p
---
I mean sure there will be demand for priests but shams/palas always the most and druids always the least.
---
Whoah calm down dude...
---
Pretty sure u/joshcorbo82 isn't rolling in hookers and cocaine lol. I've only heard a tiny bit of one of his casts and he seems like a decent guy.
---
But he clearly needs to stay out of PR related stuff. He handled this whole transcript thing with the grace of an elephant in a porcelain shop.
---
Can't see that in his post.
---
Nevertheless there's still at least 2 of 3 pally role that need spirit.
---
And if he aim to play holly, why should he bother to play dwarf ? The stone buff could only be useful in PvP (as in PvE healers should not get damages)
---
They are up tho.... the servers are online just not allowing you to connect....
---
I didn't see the classic option at first, after the update it appeared. Might need to re download battle.net from the website.
---
Assuming Classic+ content, I think the idea for these items should be locked behind more intricate questlines and have more interesting abilities. e.g. Quel'Serrar or Scepter style quests that pull you into raids and have gold sinks involved, combining multiple professions (enchanting, smithing, engineering, etc.) so it's still pretty rare and an accomplishment to receive it.
---
e.g.
---
    Avenger's Shield 
---
    Off-Hand       Shield
---
    3105 Armor
---
    62 Block
---
    15 Intellect
---
    20 Stamina
---
    Equip: Increases your chance to block
---
    attacks with a shield by 3%.
---
    Equip: Blocked attacks have a chance to
---
    deal 65-83 Holy damage to the attacker and
---
    restore 120 mana or 10 rage to the wielder.
---
    Use: Hurls your shield at an enemy target,
---
    dealing 453-618 Holy damage and a high
---
    amount of threat. (30 Sec Cooldown).
---
Here's an in-flavor item that's usable by Paladins, Warriors (AoE, extra threat), and Ele Shaman (burst dmg) but synergizes well with the Paladin's kit using Righteous Fury.
---
That sucks. They made me change my DK from Führer, he's known as Obligated now.
---
Yeah... WoD was straight up bad. I hit the cap and logged out for several months. I just had no interest or care in playing, and I'd never felt that poorly toward the game before, though of course I knew it wasn't perfect.
---
Cata in hindsight wasn't really that bad; I played almost the entire expansion (had surgery the day it dropped so I can't say I played through the whole thing), and overall liked the gameplay and raids/dungeons. They still had tier sets and I liked that Dragonsoul gave some \*fun weapons\* like the polearm and bow. :)

I did some raiding in MoP and had quite a bit of fun with alts. Class design was pretty awesome, imo. I didn't care for the dungeons but I didn't hate them all either; the lore bored me and I was upset they made the entire expansion so panda-centric. I still feel that way. Still a decent expansion all things considered, but I started mentally checking out when Timeless Isle came out. I know I'm in the minority but I really didn't like it.
---
Draenor offered me absolutely nothing. I came in to play it after my hiatus from the game but I never really \*enjoyed\* it.
---
Also, PvP is not the only way to play.
---
Yeah, that would be a big no from me.
---
For me there a very clear definitive line; on one side is work, and the other, not work.  There is no blending of the two.
---
If others at work played WoW I would be happy to talk to them about it, but that would be as far as it goes.
---
No, there should not be achievements in Classic. You seem to be confused
---
So what's next?

---
&gt; You're trolling if you're equating Cross server BGs to cross server matchmade PVE. Cross server BGs are bad, but so limited in scope that the impact they have on a game is minuscule compared to other cross server shit.
---
&gt;Yeah man, why would you wanna do a bunch of different raids every week when you could do the same raid 4 times? 
---
Nobody forced you to do it. It allowed all sorts of guilds to raid. Small casual guilds, big casual guilds, small  more hardcore guilds, big hardcreo guilds.
---
&gt;Oh, you're just trolling
---
No you are just a clueless hater
---
Can't collect all the recipes that way, gotta get into raids and dungeon groups. :(
---
I’m going to tank as feral in classic and there’s nothing you can do to stop me!
---
Oh yeah... the thing he linked has numbers from beta. Most the formulas though are from old theorycrafting so hard to say.
---
that makes more sense thank you
---
Got my names saved!

are you trying to log into the 'beta and stress test" version of wow or the "wow classic" version of wow in the dropdown menu?
---
Server community is not disregarded.
---
It definitely doesn't become about the individual and if you think it does I challenge you to get above rank 12 by solo queue. See how far you get.
---
I didn't even mention the length of queues so I don't know why you did. I didn't even mention gratification, so I don't know why you did. Not to mention crossrealms do not deliver that by default. 
---
It will not hurt classic.
---
Im just sick and tired of your BS, lady.
---
It's one of my favourite expansions because I was a heavily invested hardcore Mythic raider. I realize that's the cup of tea of a tiny, miniscule minority, but WoD had (at the time) the absolute best ingame cinematics (Talador cinematic blows Jade Forest out of the water), amazing questlines, storytelling, music, environment, and the best ever starting raids (IMO) than the usual first tier for pretty much any expansion before it, ie Blackrock Foundry and Highmaul.
---
I enjoyed HFC much less though. The first tier on Mythic was so damn fun. HFC to me though felt mostly likely a chore, but that may have more to do with my raiding environment than the raids, it's hard to judge even in hindsight.
---
I just checked his post history. He seems intent on antagonizing people and doesn't seem to have much interest in the exchange of ideas or debate.
---
I think people should start transcribing it just to piss this dude off, honestly
---
LOK'TAR!
---
The Ultima Online purist in me wants hold right click and move towards my mouse pointer.
---
People don’t want an easier classic. They want classic, as it was. 
---
Classic as it was is just going to be easier now.
---
Players are better now. More info is available. The only way it would play the exact same is to scale up everything and make it more complicated, but then you’ve created a completely different game. 
---
The fact is no matter what you do, it will never be a perfect match of playing for the first time when you knew nothing. People know mechanics and how to min/max, raids will be easier, etc. They can’t just completely change boss encounters to make it harder.
---
Its funny. I can login into the real Beta, but not into the Stresstest. o_0

---
In case you were wondering, I read on the discord that private servers had set shamans to caster rules for glancing blows which apparently caused their hits to sometimes go single digits. 
---
I am not super versed in this, but the guys knew their shit, and someone was actually testing and getting numbers that were not less than half the top specs. Which IMO makes them at least workable.
---
World PvP, it has to be Succubus. It's literally the Warlock equivalent of a Mage's Sheep. You use it to get a proper opener and upper hand against an enemy or it forces an opponent to use cooldowns(trinket/wotf) at the very beginning of the fight, which helps to actually cast Fear to successfully CC later in the fight.
---
Also, if you set up keybinds properly and micro her well, you can easily use Seduce to force enemies to use gap closers prematurely/inopportunely to get an upper hand in the beginning or mid fight.
---
It's arguably better than felhunter even against casters because Seduce helps as an interrupt 3 times, while you will likely only get 1 chance to spellock and realistically you'll be facing a mage/warlock opponent. Seducing a Warlock helps to banish their pet and get the upper hand while seducing a mage forces mages to pop Ice Block early.
---
Felhunter is best for BG's to spellock enemy healers/casters to turn the tide of a fight. And because AoE dmg will most likely break out anyone you would have seduced.
---
Voidwalker is situationally best only against Warriors to rage starve them or Rogues to prevent them from stun locking you to death.
---
Imp is only good if you're speced for Destruction, but it's useful in World PvP and BG's, but more so in BG's.
---
I haven't met anybody who said "I am happy I spent the last 10 years playing WoW instead of getting married or having a real social life".
---
People who play that much are just trying to avoid dealing with their issues.
---
and thats how you move in albion. go to options and change to "RTS - like controls" and thats exactly how your character will move around. literally hold right click and move toward mouse.
---
Yeah let’s nip that mistake in the butt before it festers too much

IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET PAID FOR STREAMING A VIDEO GAME, MAYBE CHOOSE ONE (OR CHOOSE AN AVENUE WITHIN ONE) THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLOIT IT. SEEING SOMEONE STREAMING THEMSELVES FARMING IS AS IF TO SAY "I KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE I AM, I DARE YOU TO DO SOMEONE ABOUT IT". ANY GRIEVANCE CAUSED BY THIS IS COMPLETELY WARRANTED, AND ANY NOTION OF PENALIZING PLAYERS FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS IS MINDBOGGLINGLY IDIOTIC. THE ONUS IS NOT ON THE PUBLIC TO UPHOLD CONSIDERATION, ITS EITHER ON THE STREAMERS TO BE PREPARED FOR THE ATTENTION THEY'RE SPOTLIGHTING ON THEMSELVES, OR ON THE STREAMERS TO EXPLORE AREAS OF THE GAME NOT IMPACTED BY THE POSSIBLE PRESENCE OF OTHERS.
---
STREAMERS IN GENERAL SEEM TO THINK THE GAME REVOLVES AROUND THEM, BUT THE OPPOSITE OF THAT IS THE COLD HARD TRUTH. THEY'RE LUCKY TO HAVE THIS GAME TO REVOLVE AROUND.
---
You mitigate damage by hamstring kiting
---
Did the survey ask PvE v PvP servers? I’d love to know that breakdown by faction if it was available.
---
I can choose a server, but when It starts to log into that server I get the message that I need an active sub to play. I am subbed...
---
Yeah it'll be fine. If people ever fall out over wow it says a lot about them lol
---
This guy..

He’s clearly never played hunter and has no idea what he’s talking about
---
Holy shit, I keep telling you YOU AREN'T IN CHARGE STOP ACTING LIKE YOU ARE. You dont get to make demands, Karen.
---
I disagree! I'm playing alliance and sure as well want more Warlocks on our side to fight alongside! The more Warlocks we have, the better our chances are. We need more ally to roll Locks!
---
Fun fact: I played vanilla for like 2 months before I knew that was an option.
---
Ha. I’ll dig around for the video of videos: ProjectX. AKA the video tockaray released with all her nude pictures and videos. I’ll let you know
---
20 minutes
---
That isn't enough IMO. You can't just add raids with copies of the same gear and think the community will be happy. 
---
The raids need new mechanics, and things for all the classes to work toward. Can't just be a gear grind. A lot of thought has to be put into the content to make sure it is both enguaging for everyone, and doesn't mess up anything in Vanilla.
---
I think the OP means that he made his character on the only RP server.  The other servers are up to make characters on too.
---
Ppl are so pissed I even brought up achievements. It’s funny.
---
Only like 12 freesync monitors are officially approved by Nvidia to be used with Gsync (and you have to have a 10 or 20 series card) but most work just fine. I haunt /r/buildapcsales and most people will tell you that freesync usually works great on most monitors with an Nvidia card.
---
It was a long way back and I didn't hit 60 on my priest until shortly after TBC launched, but I seem to remember hearing that mind control had periodic resistance checks while it was being channeled that could cause it to break early, and they were affected by +hit

Get a life kiddo

I want to play a dps class. I started playing during wotlk as an enhancement shaman I loved the idea of it, dual wielding, spells, summoning wolves, it just screamed badass to me. For some reason all the pure dps classes dont seem as cool to me as the hybrid classes, but I want to be competitive (not hyper competitive) as a dps in raids and pvp. I'm liking the idea of feral druid, but I really have no interest in tanking, I'm sure I'll do some tanking in dungeons to level but not maxed. Spriest also sounds like a cool class to me. 
---
Basically I want to play a hybrid dps class but I dont want to be handicapped that it's not a full dps class.
---
Yeah that’s a great idea too, and sounds like fun.  Stealth will feel great after running out in the open with a warrior in contested zones.
---
I hear you can tie a NA Trial account to your active EU sub.. and then get into the test
---
Thats actually pretty close to a perfect combo, Yeah I dont have to much time to play games but as a druid the stealth / gank aspect is still there along with the end game healing! I like it
---
Yeah I don't knock it for existing I just think people should be realistic with themselves about the necessary effort to bring "underpar" classes up to par.
---
Given that this will all be wiped I just used the randomiser to get a name.
---
Cata was good too if you were into pvp, can’t speak on the pve though.
---
I'm getting an error with active subscription required. I am subscribed so this is kind of pissing me off. Anyone else?

Not even close, lmfao.  The one thing you could say is that he destroyed the death star, but he only did so because Han bailed him out and because he had an omnipresent force ghost holding his hand the entire time.  Everything else?

- Struggled and failed constantly training under Yoda (he's basically only shown to be failing during his entire time there, whether it be stacking rocks or confronting the dark side in the cave).

Meanwhile Rey is a scavenger from a remote desert planet that learns how to fly the Falcon like an ace pilot in all of about 1 minute, is apparently a master engineer, learns how to perform advanced master-level Jedi techniques in a matter of minutes, beats a well-trained dark side practitioner in the use of the force _and_ in a lightsaber duel, mingles with the dark side in the cave with no adverse consequences, lifts an avalanche of boulders without even straining, etc.  And that's just off the top of my head.
---
You're definitely not getting this name now.
---
Not trying to be a dick, but any post starting with “I don’t think people understand,” or “I don’t think anyone has thought of this” is already just wrong 99% of the time. You’re giving yourself a little too much credit.
---
Everyone is thinking about these things, everyone knows it’s not ideal, everyone knows it’s necessary.

There is very little information anyone can offer that people don’t already know or haven’t already discussed.

WoD was amazing - untill you ran out of stuff to do. And the problem wasn't that you ran out of stuff to do, but rather how quickly you reached that point.
---
WoD instances were good, but that’s about it.
---
You cant tell me what to do.
---
Fuck me , should’ve known that! Big mistake haha
---
Hyperbole aside, it isn't the smartest idea from a testing standpoint to only get testing information from people who are either currently subscribed, or willing to subscribe just to test. But whatever it's not like they don't know what they're doing.
---
At least they have an argument that their totem buffs are more valid than Resto because they have both the GCDs and don't need the mana for heals to twist totems &gt;_&gt;

hey quick question: I used to have Beta and Stress test along with Retail but now I have 3 options
---
does this mean i got invited to the beta as well?
---
Just for stress tests though now for the actual classic launch
---
Sorry but wow graphic isnt shit.
---
Thats not some nostalgia crap i give from myself but you ever compared wow to any other mmorpg game?
---
Thats one of a thousand things they did right. They didnt try to match realism and they didnt go too deep into cartoon and crafted a perfectly balanced graphic thats actually timeless..
---
Look at guild wars/lotro/teso etc.
---
One of the biggest mistakes they did was trying to have realistic graphics and nowadays it looks bad.
---
And if there are people disagreeing, you can switch between retail and vanilla graphic ingame so no worries..
---
enchant weapon spellpower and flametongue weapon.
---
Like I said I videos though, they pick and choose. Every normal person would. Nobody wants to show getting their ass whooped. That being said I wouldn't be worried, warriors are solid
---
Whewwwww.
---
Its because you were in a prior stress test. Blizzard nuked the option after the previous stress test and everyone bitched and complained. "I can't uninstall the game because you removed the option wasting my precious hdd space"
---
After blizzard re-added the option everyone bitched and complained. "You invited me to beta but then removed it, how dare you!!!".
---
The easy way to test if you are actually in the beta or not is to select beta. Uninstall it. If after uninstalling the beta option disappears. You were never in the beta.
---
Blue is normal name tag, green is pvp tagged on.
---
I think it's mostly word of mouth and wanting to be snowflakes, a lot of people are choosing their classes based on popularity.
---
Can honestly expect more druids/hunters/rogues and less shamans/locks come release.
---
I would agree for some individuals like superiors but if someone else I work with enjoys WoW as much as I do I don't mind playing with them.
---
So the food would be up... Just can't eat it yet. I mean you just... Nevermind.
---
Probably not worth it, because you'll likely run all the way to the vendor just to find out that somebody else has already bought it.
---
True. Not that I agree with your method, but I acknowledge the fact that finding RPers to make fun of, on a non RP server would not be the best practice.
---
They did that in tbc
---
Right I bet you never speed when there's no cops around.
---
Hey guys !
---
 I want to play a healer in Classic, on Horde side, mainly for BGs, probably not ‘premade’ but solo. I can’t decide between Priest and Druid. I really love the druid’s mobility and I know that, as an hybrid class, he brings different things to the table but I am afraid of the lack of ‘flash heal’. If I understand correctly, a lot of classes in Vanilla have burst capacities. So, my question is about druid’s abilty to heal teammates under pressure. Is it possible to do that with Hots, R4 healing touch (cast time : 2 sec !), Regrowth (important mana cost) and Swiftmend (20% of base mana) ? Or should I go Priest ? What do you think ?  
---
Thanks a lot !
---
All even still tree talent build
---

---
people are just hyped. in reality any real guild clears content in a day and farms dungeons within each others to a point and maybe pvpes till next raid day next week. normal people wont even see these people. lfr people get bored to death before 60 and real pve retail players wont even bother with classic. its gonna be chill as fuck whoever continues to play it trust me.
---
Well, we cleared MC and some of BWL when the debuff limit was still 8.  So there are definitely not 16 required debuffs.
---
Wonder if EU boys can join 
---
:\^(
---
Yeah, MC can periodically break like that, but I'm unsure if it's affected by +hit.
---
Aux is a 1.12 addon. It will need a complete re-write for Classic and the developer hasn't confirmed he plans to do it.
---
&gt;  I know this is just the test servers but how dare you.
---
which name was that?
---
2PM PST
---
5PM EST
---
So, in 15 mins.
---
I still get to use it for the stress test so I don't see the issue.
---
They did? Because I remember having to grind battle grounds to earn a shield that was a huge upgrade over anything I could get in PvE until two raid tiers ahead of me.
---
I could see everything up to major domo being cleared, but getting the gear for the final two bosses as well as a couple people getting aqual quintessences isn't gonna happen in time, not to mention resistance gear for the tank.
---
It’s mostly the versatility, I really enjoy tanking 5 mans, but not raids, and I enjoy healing either of them, so that statement alone screams Druid or paladin, but honestly paladin looks like such a nightmare to level and I want to enjoy the levelling process, and in regards to shamans I have thought about it, we haven’t decided yet whether we’re going horde or alliance so it’s not off the table, although I feel like the totem mechanic might not be my favourite
---
When I played a priest I was constantly randomly asked if I wanted to join groups, that's kinda what I mean. That said I know so many people coming back for classic I doubt it'll be an issue :P
---

---
I certainly do; I'm a Windows SysAdmin.  
---
Windows 10 is not allowed on my home network and I use a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) to block as much as I can.
---
I got Wildblood so I'm happy
---
I am... also pretty sure you got one tier higher. I remember you started getting Mythic chests after you got a magic number of Heroic kills. 25 or something?
---
After getting 25 kills, we were obviously already into Mythic, so from our perpsective, yes, it's 'the current tier', but it's not like that for slower guilds. Also, the chests could give you any non trinket or weapon item, which even includes shit from Mythic Blackhand IIRC.
---
After BFA, I find it to be not too bad.
---
I’m eu and I got invited today
---
Would it be possible to tank 5 mans and heal raids or 5 mans without having to respec constantly? And would I have to carry around two entire sets of gear?
---
Nope, but thats something completely different. 
---
For IRL activities it's almost impossible to track you down and know what you are doing right now. But if, for example, you'd rather play alone rather than with your colleagues, it can degenerate pretty quickly. No matter how close you are to these people, they are still "just" your work colleagues. You will only see the true nature of real friends when they are no longer your work colleagues.
---
But I think you didn't read my first post correctly when I wrote that you shouldn't be battle.net friends. Maybe the first two sarcastic rules were too much for you. 
---
Besides, I doubt your way of expressing yourself at all that you maintain social contacts.
---
I learned my lesson after playing D&amp;D with some co-workers.  Best to keep work people at work where they belong.  That way in game issues stay in game and don't crop up where you work.
---
My point is that there's clearly more to it than "nostalgia nochange logic".
---
TBC had the issue of PvE gear being dominant in PvP. More drastic separation would be optimal, but at this point I'd be happy for a #nochanges TBC.
---
Why did you give separate values at different tiers?  Taladril separates BWL from Naxx because the T2 set bonus changes the stat weight of spirit.  I don't think there's any reason to give separate stat weights at different tiers for Balance druids.
---
Yuuup I have the other one so I feel obligated to do...some stuff with a gnomish death ray.
---
It’s not up.
---
Meant to, thanks for the reminder. It was more of a tongue-in-cheek "No reason to worry, folks." but I dropped the ball on the final removal/lock.
---
I also am on the both train. 
---
Even if each expansion only adds half a million players to their bottom line that's still 7.5 million dollars toward a content creation team for that version that is basically free good will toward the community. Eventually we will have WoW back on that track toward 20 million subs that I'm 100% sure Blizzard wants.

It's not the OP itself, it's numerous insulting replies which we've now removed.

Do they restore banned accounts?
---
A functioning loot council has nothing to do with establishing cliques and convincing anyone to give them loot.  That would be a dysfunctional loot council.
---
A functioning LC, or loot dictatorship that I ran for a while (I made the sole and final decision on loot in my raids), attendance was my top criteria.  If you don't show up to raids, you're not worth gearing.  Assuming 100% attendance between people competing for the same item, then we'll defer to DPS, and I don't mean just "who topped the last fight", but checking logs after every raid, and seeing that VikingDad is consistently higher DPS, and has identical attendance, well clearly he is getting [item upgrade] first.
---
Its really simple, but I don't blame people for not wanting to join a guild using that system, they've probably been part of dysfunctional LC's and are wary of if a new one is actually functional or not, or they've been burned enough they aren't even aware theres a difference.
---
Yes. Your guild that knows youre boomkin just kicks you out of raid. Man you need better people to play with
---
Back then every server had an active forum at wow.com where ALL communication happened. Recruitment, cross-server shit talking / world pvp witch hunts, etc. Blacklisting wasn't a thing - even ninja looters were forgotten.

Hi, I'm a little confused. Are these the stress test servers you guys are talking about?
---
zangarmarsh?
---
thats funny because thats the zone that was the final straw for me when it came to BC. I quit and didnt come back til wrath. quit after wrath ended and havent been back since
---
I am able to create a char but cant enter world yet.
---
I played warrior in classic. Don’t even attempt  a tank build till you’ve hit 60. Use mining and blacksmithing (weapon Smith ) till at least high 50s so that you can make weapon upgrades when you’ve got the materials available. Duo level when possible and run the 5 man instances a couple of times more than you think necessary. It’s easy to find groups as a warrior and the dp will be close enough to the world leveling but not as boring (imo). 
---
Have fun and good luck!

I would quote the billy Madison "I award you no points" line, but I'll end this agree to disagree nonsense with with cold hard fact you will have to deal with.
---
Twinking exists in vanilla/classic. It will continue to exist, and your misinformed opinion will not change that. Sucks to be you, I guess. Have fun not enjoying one of the many aspects of Classic, and hating those that do participate in it.
---
He's an idiot for making the perfectly logical assumption that a re-release modeled on the 1.12.1 database won't have the achievement system implemented?
---
I mean it's not on the beta, there's been no word about adding it, and according to the dev watercooler since achievements aren't in the 1.12.1 data set they by default won't appear and made no suggestions that they are going to change that.
---
the first iteration of dungeon finder was restricted to only your server. 
---
So at the least, you still knew the people in your group.
---
Wrath still the best expac imo.
---
You can sub to your US account and it will allow you in, I am EU and this worked.
---
I think druid in cat form does more than zero damage even when specced balance
---
You mean you have the download available? Because everyone does. EU accounts will not be able to access the Stress Test.
---
The irony
---
Your argument when I said "Wotlk had some of the best balancing in pve and pvp in the entire history of the game." was 
---
&gt;Oh, you're just trolling. GJ, you got me lmao
---
why train skills when i need to save for a mount?
---
This jump in and out is impossible in wow and they wont be rushing through dungeons without communication.
---
Its simply impossible in vanilla and small talk will automatically begin.
---
They will love it and get hooked as everyone else did that played wow for the first time.. Especially dungeons.
---
Theres a reason wow was a big topic over years in the news all across the world. 
---
And tbh. Give a worthy alternative to wow.
---
Thanks!!
---
Yeah that one. But I can see that. For me, it felt like a change of scenery from all the other zones I level in.
---
I have to agree with this, they made it too simply and easy.
---
Damn dude, that man had a family!
---

Maybe Deathwing squeezes himself through the dark portal and flips Outland upside down.
---
Im surprised more people arent having this reaction.
---
Yeah watching popular streamers is nuts. Whenever they're in a city people run up to them and give them gold, mats, great upgrades, etc.
---
No. You have an opinion.
---
you think you do, but you dont:
---
Remember the audience. People who come here do not represent the average player base. My first character was a hunter because I thought it was cool I could have a pet. I now know better 😉
---
I tried tons of insta-60 pservers, and I could never stick with them more than a few hours. I just don't care about the character. Same with the many insta-58 TBC servers that came out. 
---
I think most people would get bored with any cotent given a free boost for a character that is ultimately meaningless.
---
A MC full clear takes hours any way you slice it. I may be the minority in this thread but IMO bringing a meme spec to a raid just means you are wasting *39 other people's* time.
---
It's because shamans are the pillars of horde raiding, thought everyone knew that by now.
---
Just like how pallies are the most played healers on alliance, shamans are for horde.
---
Priests are slightly behind them in terms of overall demand, generally speaking raids can have up to 7-8 shamans in a raid grp , which is almost twice as much as priest slots usually, so shammies almost always have raid spots in any guild ( as resto ).
---
If you add to that how appealing running around in a 2 H and 1 shotting players in WF or  chain lightning , the class packs some serious burst for it's other 2 specs which is great for pvp.
---
So overall, all 3 specs are appealing.
---
hoping for an rp pvp server so i can create a character there.
---
Ah that explains it, cheers
---
Skills =/= talents but basically yeah, only fix gear when you replace it with drops, plate and mail is not the only thing, getting a full cloth int set for a dungeon is useful to grind some weapon skills too
---
It's in the entrance to UBRS, don't even need the key.
---
RemindMe! 6 months
---
So that's your plan until you die?  No emergency fund, no retirement?
---
Scream CD is 30 secs, 26 with talents
---
Shhh stop remind people
---
What about cross realm BGs?
---
FC - Druid
---
Heals - Priest/Shaman
---
DPS - Warrior/Warrior/Mage/Rogue/Warlock/Hunter/ ele Shaman
---
Well ally does have dwarf Priest which can give their entire battle group fear Ward on a 30 second cool down.
---
In premade BGs horde warlocks get shafted way harder than ally.
---
Also sword and mace spec for humans is arguably the best PvE talent in the game. It gives humans the best TPS with Thunderfury and most top tier DPS weapons are also swords or maces, with there being only two really solid main hand axes in Hatchet of Sundered Bone and Deathbringer. There's also the AQ 40 armament axe, but a warrior would have to be crazy to take that over the shield. Compare that to the several great MH for maces and swords:  Castigator, MSA, Gresil, AQR, Sand Polished Hammer, CTS, Vis'kag, Nightmare Blade... Hell even Spineshatter, a comparatively mediocre mace dropped off Razorgore, is a better main hand than any axe outside of the three listed above.
---
Humans are op.
---
Doesn't work for me, keeps saying I need active game time, which I already have.
---
If you played vanilla you would understand. 
---
Someones skill and time spent in the game is shown through the gear they use and since transmog doesnt exist you dont need to inspect people you just know right away who is hardcore and what they have done. 
---
You have much to learn young padawan.
---
I would prefer cross realm added in phase 4 indeed, but IMO it's not a big deal.
---
Sub is very niche play style that I personally find to be mind numbing compared to Seal Fate and or Combat Swords. Subtlety will shine a bit more in PvP but overall you have to be willing to learn how to play that style.
---
for a moment I dreamed.....
---
Well, contrast to classic imo star wars 1 was alsof pretty crappy to begin with. Universe might be cool, but the acting and suspense was terrible.
---
&gt; To help new players/Player made quests, to relax after raiding &amp; grinding
---
That's the best part of the whole plan
---
I hope I end up on your server man, gl hf
---
Priest is the easiest healing class because you have so many options to save your team and yourself.
---
&gt; Cry?
---
Crendor?
---
WoD was pretty goddamn awful, but for the opposite reasons to BFA. The content that was in WoD was decent, the raids were pretty great, dungeons were good too. World content was a bit lacking but it had been for years until they tried to improve it with Legion. WoD just didn't have enough to do, the stuff that WAS there was pretty good, other than the garrisons. BFA has the opposite problem of there being lots to do, but no one really caring about doing any of it because none of it feels that fun.
---
honestly i never really did much pvp at all. so i really cant comment on that. 
---
i likely did less than 20 max level bgs during wrath.
---
Has to do it in Dolonar. You have to do Res in IF.
---
I spent 1 whole year at level 18. I would get on everyday and hangout with my online friends. We would walk around stormwind talking, play in the deeprun tram, take huge trips to Darn and help low levels through the wetlands on our way back. I only started to level again because my brother got to 30 and made me jealous.
---
Yeah its been possible to make your character for the past 15 mins
---
cata blew up azeroth though :(
---
Because that creates more work for the loot council. Being able to focus on a smaller number allows better discussion and more thought to go into it which should lead to better outcomes.
---

Social environment contributes to the playstyle of a massively *multiplayer* online role-playing game.
---
Lol those dudes who post dps meters in Party chat. Even when I'm at the top it still makes my eyes roll.
---
Back in the day, the popular leveling spec was actually to drain tank with a 31/x/x leveling building, using 5/5 Fel Concentration with DOTS into Drain Life, an auto-attacking Succubus with Lash of Pain disabled, and stealing mana from your pet with Dark Pact.
---
Granted, I'd be shocked if it's more efficient than the private server optimized Voidwalker+DoTs+Wand strategy, but it's worth noting that drain tanking used to be the leveling norm.
---
Shit designed game? Maybe BfA is better for you, off you go now...
---
Pserver my dude.
---
you can tank or heal 5 mans in Heart of the wild spec.
---
you will need 2 sets of gear.
---
Alot of people don't want to accept this fact. People this classic is going to be booming with new players ..more than retail. The truth is it wont be. No one wants to level at that slow ass rate when they have become accustomed to how quick it is in retail compared to classic.
---
Warrior have always been the most played class in vanilla, they're the ultimate glory bait.
---
All 3 specs are viable, #1 dps and tank , best class in any group related content with the only downside being slowest leveler and sub-par in solo content.
---
Nice bro! I’m in South Park. :)
---
Didn't enjoy all content, did very much enjoy all lore and storylines
---
Yeah but you don't have to work with them at the next day. And you never know how a person ingame behaves before playing with them.  But I have to confess, that my best friend was a co-worker to me several years ago and with playing WoW we grow together. Even that caused some disputes at work and ingame, but after I left the company it was even better. Same story for him, when he left 2 months later, he had a better friendship with a thrid co-worker after he left and "only" played with him from time to time.
---
Desolace is a good spot. Grind Centaurs.
---
Do you know and under stand the systems of battlegroups? Im comfortable with having battlegroups in classic pretty sure it was implemented back in vanilla but i could be wrong
---
You’re thinking retail...
---
Once again, if you can't defend what you do and are reduced to petulantly repeating that you will do it, it's 100% guaranteed you are being a douche.
---
No one except the author gets it.
---
Yea the problem with WoD was raiding the same raid 4 times a week on each character.
---
If you a sneaky then yes sub is good
---
We don't want TBC, we want Wrath.
---
We don't want Wrath, we want Cata!
---
We don't want Cata...
---
Wait a second...
---
Oh God, we really **do** want BfA!
---
I’m in South Park! Short T ride from ya!

BiS is the 38" HDR 21:9 3840 x 1600 144Hz (175 Overclock) NVIDIA® G-SYNC® LG 38GL950G-B which is going to be a requirement to raid Molten Core in a progression guild.
---
the first iteration of group finder was restricted to your server only. 
---
And by that point (it was the ICC patch, 3.3) most people were rocking at least 232 gear, a full 55 item levels above the gear that was dropped in them, not to mention, by this point, heroics dropped badges of justice, which bought you 245ilvl gear.
---
LFGs introduction at this point in the game was hardly controversial because heroics were already a complete joke, and you did them to gear up alts or for the daily.
---
god i miss wrath professions.
---
All druids to shake the meta
---
Sadly this happened to me when I started playing again a year or so ago.
---
Wolfshead Helm by its very nature scales with the rest of your gear. 20 energy is worth exactly the same in phase 1 gear as it is in phase 6 gear. This tells me that you don't actually understand how it works.
---
306 people think they’ll hit 60 in under 7 days. 
---
The established record /played is 4 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes. That’d be 19+ hours a day for six days to match...I’m guessing 306 people won’t be doing that 😉
---
Agreed, at my work one guy has been quietly blacklisted by the entire office.
---
It's all well and good telling people to just say they don't want to play with them. However you do need to understand that many people can become incredibly unreasonable for a number of reasons.
---
You tell them this and they either take it as a personal attack or if you provide an excuse such as "I'm not enjoying X anymore" they do not accept it.
---
The worst thing is with the person I'm talking about they are actually quite fun to play with for a week or two then suddenly they become an expert that tells you how to play your class and sulks when you try and coordinate in a group because "you are telling them what to do"
---
Of course this will vary greatly between individuals, but my experience is it exposes you to a lot of drama and can ruin your enjoyment of the game.
---
Yeah how is this relevant here?
---
I'm sorry I meant Alchemy, not herbalism.
---
but why
---
You don't have to listen to it on youtube, and I guess that  the minority does not
---
Credits are linked at the end of the video, at least watch it till the end before posting hating comments.

So they should get special treatment and get paid for it?  Sign me up to this special privilege list.
---
Depending on boss you want to use a sharpening stone instead since many are immune to your poisons.
---
Nope. UC has an AH in vanilla pretty sure stormwind did too
---
IMO, the only bad thing about MoP was the content drought of SoO for a year, to only end up with WoD.
---
what about the 2005 Blizzcon pet?
---
Its possible, but the probability is very low
---
Good luck Shape shifting without mana
---
Same, WOTLK was peak wow for me. My favourite time and classes. TBC was also good. What WOTLK server you play BTW?
---
Zangramarsh. Nagrand was my favorite place in wow
---
I play Horde
---
There is a cinematic!!!!
---
Past hour*
---
eu here too. But surely this shouldn't be an issue?
---
You're right. I will correct that mistake!
---
What are you talking about.
---
Cross realms BGs were introduced by BLIZZARD in vanilla because people had to wait in a queue for 3 hours for a BG to pop up.
---
It was 100% the beginning of the end. Let me just list some of the things people hated even when it came live.
---
1. Welfare epics (epics already started basically becoming welfare in TBC since each last boss of a heroic dungeon had a few epics in their loot table plus MGT was stacked with epics), but welfare epics on steroids because it had four bloody dungeons that dropped only epics, plus the end of hc epics were even more common.
---
2. Almost the entirety of the first tier was recycled content. New content was Malygos and Sartharion, a mere two bosses. Everything else rehashed from Naxxramas, featuring very stale mechanics when compared to Malygos. And then you had Trial of the Grand Crusader which was even more ridiculous, an entire raid taking place in a coliseum that's the *exact* same as the dungeon. Its only saving grace were Ulduar and Icecrown, legendary raids that compete with classics like Sunwell Plateau, Blackrock Foundry etc for people's #1 raid ever. That is to say, **half** of the expansion's raiding content was very much half-assed. 
---
3. It took the badge system from TBC (which was a very slow catchup mechanics) and fed it steroids. The badge system in TBC was only designed to let you catch up to people already in Tier 4, which was only the first tier of TBC. It did not invalidate the first tier as you had zero hope of decking yourself in that gear before the expansion was over, and it was just the first tier anyway. WotLK completely **invalidated** its first tier, then proceeded to completely invalidate Ulduar, then did the same for Trial of the Crusader, by adding new badge vendors each new patch. You bought an expansion and a subscription in 3.2? Congratulations, you only have a single raid to raid. Ulduar? Malygos? Sartharion? Naxxramas? What are those? Nobody is doing them, if you wanna do them, join some half-assed achievement run.
---
4. You think the badge catch up system was bad? They turned it even more ridiculous when they introduced MGT-esque dungeons **every patch** in order to even further invalidate the previous tier. MGT was introduced in the final stretch of TBC, when if you just joined, you basically had no hope of clearing all 3 tiers before the expansion was over. It served to boost your strength so you can join some guild before it's all over. WotLK was all about turning each tier into a compartmentalized section of content bound by a patch. When TBC launched, it launched with two tiers, and a mere couple of months after release an entire third tier was released before anyone even killed Kael'thas. WotLK started retail's current philosophy, which was release one tier at a time, and basically delete the previous tier so that returning players can go and enjoy the most recent content, at the cost of **current** players being able to feel satisfaction from properly achieving their goals without the experience being cheapened by welfare gear. No wonder retail's population is so bloody finnicky, Blizzard bloody designed the system to be like that.
---
5. LFD. Need I say more?
---
6. Zero challenge heroics, a far cry departure from the dungeons of vanilla and TBC. Just aggro everything in the room, and pull the boss with it, while you're still in greens.
---
Every spec in vanilla is viable, they just aren't optimal.
---
As you say it's a risk and there's a reason "don't shit where you eat" is an expression.
---
You can be the most reasonable, level headed person in the world but you will normally only discover the same is not true of other people when it's too late.
---
As a fellow Hordie that has had to trot out the "but what about the Tauren..." line, I feel like it's the only race we have that hasn't been involved in some messed up shit over the years. The UD are straight dicks, the Orcs line up for every strongman that takes the reins, everyone other dungeon is full of evil trolls, the Blood Elves started out as demon-essence vampires and who the hell even knows when they are now. There's Goblins later on, I guess, but eeeeeh.
---
On the Alliance side, sure, the humans have been up to some shit, but everyone else is pretty much on the straight and narrow. Gnomeregan was cleansed of evil, the Dark Iron dwarves had a redemption ark, Night Elves are the woobies, and Draenei are the space jesus.
---
They were added late TBC, so we have no real way of knowing how xrealm with effect the rank 14 grind, except im pretty confident xrealm BGs = you need to account share to hit R14. So they should def not add them in until after naxx imo. (like real classic)
---
Leveling daggers is rough. I will be doing it on my alt rogue but he will be fed twink gear all the way to 60. It’s slower but it’s fun. Will make you better at PvP by the time you hit 60 for sure. Have to use your stuns and stuff way more.
---
Why even rehost it at all though? You are costing him view regardless.
---
&gt; How are MoP and Cata rated as badly as WoD?
---
Boiling any expansion down to a single number is somewhat meaningless, because there are so many different axes on which they can be good or bad. 
---
But by my standards, Cataclysm and MoP rank very low indeed. Those are the ones that, respectively, dumbed down and then completely killed off talents.
---
Fair enough just speaking for both sides
---
The 2 Oceanic realms in Classic are going to be fucking dead. Yikes.
---
How did you skip Borderlands 3?
---

---
&gt; MP5 from gear is only useful on fights longer than 2 and a half minutes; which isn't many in the grand scheme of things during Vanilla.
---
So questing?
---
You can, yeah. That's the earliest that the game will let you step through the Dark Portal. But between the Dungeon Finder and other stuff it's no longer necessary for people who don't want to go there.
---
It definitely seemes like an "Onyxia deep breaths more" kind of thing. Like nobody REALLY knew what caused it but there were theories. From what I have read people generally tend to think shadow resistance, level difference and distance from the priest increased chance of it breaking early. Some specced into shadow but at least the general consesus was that having few like 3 or 4% hit from gear had the same effect.
---
Some guilds tanked adds right on Raz so you could just MC and immediately shield and taunt without moving but we always tanked the adds away from the boss. That way you could also easily taunt and pick up the boss if it broke early.
---
Personally I think MC might have had some latency issues as I remember some immediate breaks happening if you tried to move the add after casting mind control, and waiting a second before starting movement seemed to mostly remove them.
---
I’ve been looking forward to rolling an enhance shaman since the first announcement. The naysayers have taken their to, but I’m sticking to my guns(Hammer)
---
you NEED a priest on horde more than you need it on alliance, since it's your only source of defensive dispel - also the shaman also heals  a bit , not only dps - you have to throw in heals
---
The flying thing is such a turn off and warlocks.
---
You realize that it's not clear from your comment which one of those you like and which one you don't?
---
Things as rare as those yes because they're incredibly economically disruptive. If they weren't tradeable in game it's be better imo.
---
I remember loving seal fate dagger build back in the day. I really never did anything with Sub in vanilla so it's quite foreign to me. Do you run daggers with sub build for leveling generally? For some reason i thought swords + hemo was a strong  build but could be wrong.
---
“We will not be making two MMOs side by side” ~ J. Allen Brack.
---
Fuck off alliance. Only outcasts accepted here!
---
Exactly, I was for a long time the guild master of a PvP guild (mostly bg and open world pvp). I would play daily with ~20 guild members, and that was pretty fun. But it was fun despite that expansion, not because of it (maybe I can say that thanks to wotlk I met my guild).
---
You don’t understand Vanilla then, stick with retail. Recognizing players/guilds in IF was one of the best parts of WoW.
---
There's no way humans won't completely storm westfall after Elwyn. People love to quest there.
---
Yeah I realise now, it was only letting me select my WoW1 US account. Thanks
---
Is engineering mandatory for tanking? I was thinking of making a Tauren tank, using arms/fury for leveling and switching to prot for late game tanking.
---
I was going to take herbalism and alchemy to take advantage of their racial passive. Or is engineering that much more important?
---
Nope I did not need to sub
---
Same could be said about all the wow expansions.
---
Part of the trick to making it not a slog was to move on the moment you could get quests and handle mobs in the next zone. But that's really just a way to make the slog take less time.
---
Does sub pretty much automatically = daggers for leveling? I genuinely don't know.
---
Are you hunter kiting? Or Fishing pole pally meta?
---
If you die *because* his dps is too low, then I can understand, otherwise it's totally unnecessary to kick him. You're just trying to find a scapegoat to blame the wipe on.
---
I said the only big mistake, many of those you listed are (IMO) either minor mistakes with small ramifications, or not even mistakes at all in the minds of a lot of people, even wow purists.
---
Resilience is always an interesting discussion. was it the best possible solution to the problem? probably not. But having it in pvp is certainly better than no fix at all. People dying without any counterplay isn't good gameplay, which is what can happen quite often when you don't have some sort of mechanic to address the issue. So in my mind resilience = not great, but better than vanilla's state of affairs.
---
badge gear as an idea is COMPLETELY FINE, it's the implementation of it down the road that was problematic. When the badge gear you introduce is really powerful, then badge gear is not a good thing to have. But the initial badge gear in 2.0 was 100% fine and not OP, it only served to supplement your gear (you'd have 2-3 pieces, none of them super powerful or better than the stuff you could potentially get from T4 drops).
---
Some dungeons are "loot hallway" style in TBC, some not. it wasn't really introduced in TBC though, many vanilla dungeons are also in this style.
---
daily quests i'll give you 100%, never liked them. But again I think having them as an optional thing on the side is pretty harmless, it's when someone down the road corrupts the idea and makes them mandatory is when the problem comes in. Which wasn't TBC's fault.
---
neutral main city is a bad idea, but not a majorly bad idea IMO
---
I know :( and sometimes the videos wont even play on firefox. I just wanted to be cool.
---
I just want to share it with other MMO fans. It is meme related to Classic wow and we are in this subredit.
---
Battlegroups were introduced in patch 1.12. We'll also get the honor system from 1.12 and not the even more punishing older versions.
---
Yeah, just imagine if classic raids had attunements...oh wait.
---
But, what if classic didn't also have 90% trash with short respawn timers...oh wait.
---
TBC was definitely guilty of introducing a few bad things, but don't think classic was pristine.
---
Notice I said Hemo outshines the other two...
---
Fuck meta critic
---
Vanilla, TBC and Wrath were amazing.  Towards the end of wrath it dramatically went downhill.  Cata was horrible enough to make me stop playing.  Tried Mists when it released... couldn’t do it.  During WoD a friend conned me into playing with the free boost and refer a friend, lost touch with this xpac as well.  Started playing Legion about a month before BFA released.  Really enjoyed the time I spent in that xpac.  But Jesus.... they really ruined it with BFA... hopefully 8.2 is as good as the streamers, i.e. BellularGaming, says it is.
---
We communed on the Server's forum on the official wow site forum. Icecrown horde.
---
There was actually some drama from time to time over player behavior and those respective players' closest guildies and supporters.
---
Well, Google Docs makes it easy to set up a multi-tabbed blacklist. So you’ve got your Memespec blacklist, your AFK-Leech blacklist, your Ninja Looter blacklist, your Toxic Asshole blacklist, and worst of all, your Doesn’t Use Push To Talk In Discord blacklist. All collated and easy to search with pivot tables and color-coded and I have no idea what I’m talking about anymore because I only use the simplest Excel functions available.
---
Except the prequels are overappreciated today, they're crap and still crap.  Same with those wow expacks.
---
“You think you do, but you don’t”
---
Man, I'm hoping my guildmates won't think as childishly as you do about this.
---
It says for me "active game time required" when I have active game time.
---
Why is my 'Play' button in the launcher grayed out? When I hover over, says "you can't play world of warcraft classic yet".
---
Release heroics actually felt heroic. For about a week or two. Then the  next two years were garbage.
---
damn, well I aint rolling warrior then, fck it... also THANK YOU for separating us and eu!
---
Every one who isn't playing a rogue hates rogues on PVP servers.. Why shouldn't we?
---
multiplayer = social
---
How is that not relevant?
---
Half the conversations we have in this subreddit are about community.
---
And unfortunately there are some players who thought they did, but ended up not. Your point?
---
I'm pretty sure people have heard about World of Warcraft
---
&gt;Also if giving good loot to players increases their chances of leaving for a better guild then I guess no one should get loot and we should just shard everything lol
---
Giving loot to players but not actually progressing will increase the chances of people leaving.
---
I’d go Tauren, herb+alchemy.
---
It definitely did introduce LFG, that was the ICC patch.
---
I can’t imagine being in a guild and doing anything other than loot council, all the others just become a game of exploiting whatever system you use
---
Hell yeah, my dude. Me too.
---
See i dont know you , but hydra , legit makes priest lvling look super fast, check it out ^^
---
I’m really torn between playing hunter or shadowpriest. My main was spriest in wrath/cata for both raiding and PvP. My first toon I ever rolled was hunter and I know they are very efficient and fun in classic. 
---
My goals: I want to grind for rank 12-14. I’ll be in a position to play as much as I want and just love the idea of joining a premade and pushing (grinding) for being the best. 
---
I also want to have fun leveling and running dungeons and world pvp etc, just classic wow things. 
---
Spriest: I’ve heard that they are very gear dependent, which is tough because they have no spots in raids due to the debuff limit. I have no interest in healing to try and acquire gear for shadow, I think it’s just kind of unreasonable to spend that much time playing an off spec to gear a main spec. Is there truth to this? Is it viable to play spriest to rank 14? 
---
Hunter: fun leveling, easy to gear, has a spot in raids and in premises + fun in world pvp. I just like the idea of being the servers best shadowpriest more than I like the gameplay of hunter. 
---
I’ve been going crazy over this any insights would be greatly appreciated
---
Except it had some of the best raiding. Aside from the lack of endgame daily content it had some of the best art design. Even tho it was rough around the edges it was no where near as bad as the current xpac
---
you are from EU probably like me we cant play it for NA only
---
Everyone speeding will be doing themselves a disservice. Leveling in vanilla was the best part of the game.
---
It is. The raids were fantastic
---
Only if the wipe is actually a result of too little dps. Sometimes people just want to scapegoat whoever is convenient.
---
No, you can do sword hemo. One problem with it is that you have no good way to fight enemies that are immune to bleeds: skeletons, ghosts, elementals. If you're dagger hemo, at least you can lead with ambush. Sword hemo is based around bleeds so it basically plays like you don't have any talent points against those types of mobs.
---
Same here, no love for us EU folk
---
Too much fun detected in this post. Reported.

I’ve got a 4K 32” Samsung monitor it can do 60hertz. And I have a 28” 1080p 60hertz monitor. My experience has been wow plays better windowed on the 4K monitor. So I’ll probably play windowed full screen and use second monitor for internetting
---
Read the comment I replied to again
---
I think you should just play the game for 48 hours.
---
Just me unable to log in due to "need active gametime" even though I have gametime?
---
That I agree with. I didnt like garrisons that much or the profession system.
---
r14 doesnt do anything for elemental shaman - the t2 pieces for 5set + some zg   (and later AQ) are actually better than all the r13/r14 gear for shaman . they only cool thing shaman gets is the r7 fast ghost wolf boots.
---
Download ad blocker you noob
---
So basically what you are saying is, they were really good at one aspect of the game, but everything else was trash? If you go to school, and only like one specific class but all the other ones were trash are you gonna 5 years later say it was a good year for school?
---
I feel like this sub consists of equal amounts of hardcore players and casual. Just like WoW has always consisted of equal amounts of these players. Coincidence?   
---
Pls, NO ONE have fun. This is what ruined WoW

Duskwood scared the crap out of 10yo me. Especially that graveyard where the grave moss grows, I explored that shit as a whisp and didn’t come back until I was older.
---
Full disclosure I played Hemo for about 3 hours in Vanilla and never could get the feel for it and was ultimately terrible at the spec.
---
I don’t PvP very much anymore and stick to the higher damage PvE specs.
---
Is there any confirmation of this? Same issue, EU as well
---
I just wanted to share it with other MMO fans. It is funny meme related to classic wow, where i am suppose to share it ?
---
Leveling sub can be a good idea on a PVP server because PVP is inevitable. People see sword rogue and know they can kill him and he'll have a difficult time getting revenge. However if people see a dagger rogue opening with ambush they know that if they pick a fight with that guy then they're done with sitting to eat or drink in that area -- they'll just get two-shot. So they think twice about picking a fight.
---
You won't top meters in dungeons, but if you're competent you can be competitive as melee hunter. Your pet does insane damage, and with traps/engineering you can deal some good damage. You'd do more as ranged, but still...
---
Druid has some down sides. Purging of hots suck but if you are playing solo it wont matter too much. Most times in solo the fights are short and enemy coordination is low. Hots, Ns and swiftment plus mobility makes you more effective when healing under pressure. Your ability to flag carry and node defend is unrivaled. If you are good at the game it wont matter. Any healer in solo pvp is good because sometimes you wont have any at all. Druid is 100 times more entertaining to play imo.
---
No you didn't?
---
It was good at nothing in vanilla, bad heal, terrible tank and not good dps.
---
Good for carrying th flag in warsong and innervate the real healers though
---
yeah was just a small tip
---
Is there a work around?
---
I certainly am. I plan on spending about a year leveling my pally. It'll be nice because we won't have to worry about impending expacs making our gear obselete. We can just chill have fun and go at our own pace. I look forward to the nights of getting mindlessly stoned and killing trolls all night in The Hinterlands
---
Good for you. Some of us deem it worth the cost. With the leftover subscription time I am going to farm gold on retail to buy WoW tokens for a few months.
---
Oh man Its US and Oceania only. No EU. That Suckkkkkkssssssssssss
---
Not sure they want you to sub for a stress test.
---
I am going to take my sweet time and take in all that vanilla flavor and level my proffs also grind alittle make new friends and pvp so endgame can wait take you're time enjoy classic
---
To each their own.  It's a great chance to see what they can handle I think.  The more people that sign up now the better (hopefully) performance will be on opening day.
---
For a second there I thought you were calling trolls lowlifes and was ready to start my voodoo mojo magic but nevermind you are cool my mom lok'tar ogar
---
&gt; Also the greatest leveling experience since TBC.^^thefirstplaythrough
---
Move to the US maybe.
---
I don't have to imagine it, I agree with it.
---
In my estimation, TBC is the best WoW has ever been. Wrath is a close second, and Vanilla is a very close third; all three are great.
---
Nearly everything after that is just undifferentiated garbage, but special hate is reserved for MoP for ruining talents.
---
I hear you and you make some very valid points. And I think for major blizzlike pservers what you're saying is hard to argue with.
---
But there were so many pservers out there, and I just assume some of them didnt really care to look into things that seemed minor to them. Or they messed up the coding and didnt bother/know how to fix it.
---
I could be way off though. Maybe the person you responded to first is making things up :)
---
[You tell me!](https://www.strawpoll.me/18195235)
---
I prefer the song shadow word pain somebody made lol.  Look it up if you haven't seen it.
---
There was a macro with /petpassive that let hunters place traps in combat.  There was a bug that briefly the server thought you were out of combat if you spammed it with a trap.
---
You can certainly make a large list. I just believe that once a blacklist gets too large the majority of the player base will just stop caring. Along the lines of one person's death is a tragedy and a million death is a statistic. 
---
Someone who plays a memespec one day doesn't mean that they don't heal the next dungeon. If someone doesn't want to play with memespecers it would be more effect to just inspect or ask the player before inviting.
---
good, i don't want anyone getting free mounts
---
I'm sure many will, but some of us enjoy the race, and right now the race is limited to streamers and friends. And if they raise the caps further, the race is over by the time the public gets access
---
What he said.
---
Blizzard changes their mind occasionally. They stated for 10 years they weren’t making Classic, but then they did. They could very well develop retail and classic content side by side if classic brings in a flood of players.
---
Twitch makes it so much easier to update them
---
I know what it is, you can still do that with a slow 1h weapon plus keeping the added defense. My point is unless you just bought a new rank of RB it's DPS isn't going to be enough to justify it's use, and even then it's still iffy.
---
option 1: You're in EU and you're fucked just like the rest of us.
---
option2: update launcher and download the classic live version (not the 1 that's in ''under development'' and you should be fine.
---
As long as you're having fun, fuck everyone who tells you your naked bandage-healing warrior isn't viable! Your fun is all that matters, who cares about those other people you're grouping with anyway?
---
You're in!

Quoting the patch notes of 3.3

"The Dungeon Finder is now available, providing players with quick and easy access to five-player parties. This feature connects all realms within a battlegroup using an advanced matchmaking system, making it easier for players of all levels to find a dungeon group. In addition, players can reap additional rewards through the Dungeon Finder by choosing the Random option, which is available to both pick-up and pre-formed groups. Check out the User Interface section for more details."
---
Yeah, my life is irrevocably fucked up. I’ve duct taped myself back together countless times growing up instead of allowing the root of my issues to heal normally due to the lack of a support structure and being told to man up.
---
It’d take a lot of time and focus away from my adult responsibilities to begin actively healing the core of my unresolved issues.
---
I think it’s too late for me now.
---
I’d need regular therapy sessions, but that’d cut into my busy work schedule.
---
Well then we'll have to agree to disagree
---
Personally worth the $15. I’ll get more enjoyment from it than I would spending that $15 elsewhere in most cases.
---
Although I was also already subbed so didn’t do it just for stress test. Understand not wanting to sub though.
---
wouldn't this make Solo = wow classic as the nostalgia money grab
---
Give it a rest. It was in vanilla, no changes
---
I would refer you to this excellent video series by Kargoz, as he is much more of an expert than I could be.  
---
https://youtu.be/C8BPATSVpRg?t=569
---
As you can see, the pieces of the pie are roughly equal, with travel time being the largest.
---
Leveling is fun, but that is something I did, quite slowly, all those years ago. Raiding? Never got the opportunity in Vanilla. I am not going to speedrun through for world first or anything, but I certainly am going to be as efficient as possible. My time isn't unlimited, and end game content is what I want to experience the most with my main.
---
Now, that said, having an Alt to chill out on and quest and savor the leveling process? That sounds optimal.
---
There will be speed levelers and people that NEVER reach 60. Part of the draw of classic to me is not just endgame, but the rest of the game as well...
---
I was actually a fool and bought a sub, since my CLASSIC launcher told me an active sub was required, for this stress test. Well i'm subbed and still cant get through to the realmlist, even though I have the newest classic client installed...
---
Definitely gonna try and get a refund.. Fool me once..
---
Healing touch rank 3 is 1.5 seconds and heals for around 550 with decent gear. If you are moonglow spec (not sure if that fits in to PvP builds or not) you can macro it so that when your rank 3 price moonglow the next cast will be rank 4 @1.5 seconds.  There are some similar macros that incorporate regrowth as well.
---
“Subtlety will shine a bit more in PvP...”
---
I may have understated it by saying “a bit”. But ultimately in PvP Hemo Swords is not THAT much better than Seal Fate Daggers, which is the only other PvP spec I know of. Again two separate play styles.
---
Go try hard somewhere else, it’s net kiddies like you that make things unenjoyable by min maxing people’s words.
---
Don't worry, I'll be rolling the rare female tauren to improve the demographics.
---
In my opinion raids in Classic are also on the bad side and only started to become mechanically interesting/challenging with Cataclysm onwards. It's not what I play Classic for.
---
I never said anything about attunements though.
---
You have given no examples of how twinks ruin battlegrounds aside ad homenim that I or other twinks are douchbags. 
---
You sound like someone who likes to march around with a pink hat fighting against the patriarchy.
---
got the same problem
---
Cata was the one where virtually all my friends stopped playing. I made new ones in mop, then WoD drove those ones away also haha.
---
Never took wow seriously ever since
---
I cant wait for old school pvp montages with big crits
---
Quoting the patch notes of 2.0.1
---
"A new Looking For Group tool designed to assist players in finding groups for instanced dungeons and quests will now be available. This interface gives players the option to be added to a pool of other players also looking for a group, as a means to expedite the process. In addition, players will also be able to search for additional members in situations where they have a group and are simply looking to find more players. For a complete overview of this new interface, please take a moment and read the information contained on our comprehensive Looking for Group preview"
---
Crandolf?
---
You need to update your launcher.
---
I did that in legion to prep for bfa spent my gold for the first 2 months of bfa hated it and never re-farmed my gold and un subbed did not know that classic was coming out and at this point I never want to log into retail again
---
\-shaman main :(
---
The posts/comments on this sub are typically from the hardcore and ultra-passionate minority. You and the casual crowd will be very much in the majority.
---
Wait we can’t play in the EU?
---
I never liked hemo. Would rather go combat swords. However full ambush sub is my favorite rogue playstyle. Allows for a lot of solo stealth runs that you can’t get as combat. You could probably do them as seal fate but I dunno didn’t try it.
---
Ayyyyy pass that good stuff my troll brother
---
I understand fully how powershifting works, what it is is using shapeshift to generate energy you would otherwise not have to use an ability you would otherwise not have the energy to use to cause DPS you would otherwise not be able to.
---
You're being disingenuous here and trying to discredit my statement to make yourself feel better without actually showing anything that proves otherwise.
---
I asked my friend why he didn't want to play classic. He said he doesn't want to grind. I replied, "you says it's a grind, I say it's a grand adventure." This is the same dude that has cutting edge on every BFA raid... raiding twice a week... who is the one that is really grinding :thinking:
---
Literally the only exceptions are the 3 raids. Highmaul was a good start, nothing too fancy, nothing too bad. BRF is one of the best raids ever released, with one of the best bosses (encounter wise) and HFC, which is either a pretty damn good raid or a mediocore one, depending on how one sees it.
---
Yea I made names on all realms and I logged in. Is this the stress test? Or is this a fuck up and we can play?
---
Remember in the burning crusade days, when you had to spam in chat “need a tank, need a tank, need a tank?”
---
You don’t remember that because now you just have a button that just says go to the dungeon.
---
You don’t want that
---
Edit: congrats on the recovery though man, char looks sick
---
This is what Vanilla is all about
---
Yessssssss
---
It's a good thing they're doing a stress test lol
---
How??
---
How?! 😢😢
---
I was a guild leader in tbc. I actually decided to bite the bullet and try to run one again even with a baby on the way and a full time job. The best part is that even though I deleted Facebook years ago, I was able to find my old guild group and independently message all my old guildies! The ones who were interested in playing joined my RL friend discord and we've been building out since then. I'm actually really looking forward to playing with all my old guild mates. It seems like everyones' lives have moved on and we're all taking a casual family style slant to our guild. Playing on US east Alliance side, if it peaks anyone's interests!
---
The beauty of classic. Thanks for sharing!
---
Make an NA account and pay $15 more dollars
---
They felt heroic until you outgeared them with raid gear. The dungeons weren't nerfed until 4.2, which was over half a year after Cata release.
---
This stress test isn’t open to EU. Next one will be.
---
It was an attempt at humor.
---
They played for the people. I.e., the social aspect.
---
Maybe you should read it again.
---
Yep same for me, EU as well.  I got the realm list up once, but that error since.
---
It’s not available for EU
---
SoC can Crit, JoR/JoC can crit.  SoC double dips Vengence (and all %dmg-on-caster mods.
---
Hey at least with phantom menace we got pot racing and duel of fates.
---
&gt; And that PvP-exclusive stat.
---
I'd call that a good choice, and one they should have embraced further.
---
There is always going to be a problem with either pve or pvp gear being better and/or easier to attain than the other. So you're going to have people who just want to pve being forced into pvp (which is fun for no one) or the other way around.
---
The only solution for that is to make pve gear better for pve, and pvp gear better for pvp. And I think they did a good job of making them slightly better for those purposes with resilience and hit, while not making them completely useless for the other purpose.

Your example of wearing greens is obviously stupid, man... I mean come on. You do NOT need to have the cross bows to be a good, valued hunter who pulls their weight. Not sure why you jumped to the polar fucking opposite to "greens". You can wear epics that aren't *BiS* doesn't mean you won't do decent damage... Jesus. If it's that upsetting don't play the fucking class.
---
Not open to EU have to have an active US &amp; Oceania region sub.
---
NE Warrior in a tank role with herbalism/alchemy.
---
Human Mage in DPS role with gathering skills then enchanting later.
---
Human Paladin in healing role with only gathering skills for $$$.
---
I'm going to make all three, get them to level 5 and sit them down at an Inn. But I'm not sure which one to main to 60 first after they all ding level 5.
---
So far I'm leaning towards the warrior/tank or mage/dps.
---
It is necessary in America
---
Battlegroups were okay imo.  They made the queues faster and the player pool was always consistent.
---
Comparing WoD to Revenge of the Sith is a sin. RotS is pretty good.
---
&gt;I think if they raise lvl cap to 60, and people will be forced to watch streamers ...
---
Yeah, there's your problem. You aren't. Take the next 60 days and go find something productive to do with your life. You'll live.
---
Was the story at least interesting?
---
I agree with a lot of what you’ve said in this thread about not wanting people to pirate and share your work, but your titles are totally click baity just like pretty much every video game content creator now days.
---
Lul
---
No, only US and OCe can play right now. EU is probably July.
---
That didn't teleport you to the dungeon though and it wasn't cross realm, which are the two big complaints about the dungeon finder
---
You’re missing the point
---
Honestly if you dont plan on healing I'd just go Hunter. You're going to spend so much time getting bugged to heal and have people lose their shit when they find out you are shadow spec.
---
Yeah, they announced that would be the case.
---
Never again dare to compare the SHIT that was cataclysm, mists and warlords with the absolute masterpiece that was Revenge of the Sith. I know you probably didn't make this yourself, but it is complete blasphemy to make this comparison even on humoristic standards.
---
Every clip has a pocket healer and the beserker buff lol
---
TLJ is a great Star Wars movie.
---
Leave the launcher open for a minute, then click options -&gt; check for updates -&gt; retsrat launcher after update and download ''Classic'' which is under the LIVE section. but again, if you're EU forget it.
---
It's not about how fast, it's about having someone else solve your problem.
---
Of course!
---
Still hoping for an RP-PvP server or a PvP server with a good community for maximum shenanigans while leveling.
---
When you hate something so much you spend your time doing something else
---
&gt; It introduced flying.
---
Definitely a critical fault. If they went with a WoD-style active where you could only fly for like 15 second to get on a plateau, it probably could've been really cool.
---
&gt; Even though it began with attunements, they were all essentially removed later in the expansion and they never came back. Sunwell was the first major raid to not have an attunement of any kind.
---
With how late it came, I don't know if you could really attribute a one-off to all of TBC.
---
&gt; It introduced short, "loot hallway" style dungeons as the standard format.
---
In what way? We had a bunch that weren't just straight paths like the CoT dungeons. Even classic was guilty of some loot hallways like VC, SM, scholo, SFK, stocks, etc. It's just a design choice that was exercised a little more heavily in TBC.
---
&gt; It introduced resilience into PvP.
---
Which is now gone.
---
&gt; It introduced the concept of badge gear.
---
Not necessarily a bad thing. Badge gear was well-received as an alternative to purchasing with gold, which kind of really sucked to farm if you didn't want to play spreadsheet economy.
---
&gt; It introduced daily ~~chores~~ quests.
---
You're very right about that one.
---
&gt; It removed the concept of faction-specific classes.
---
I think the flavor was maintained so I don't know if I can agree with this. I think the larger issue was class homogenization which happened in a later expansion.
---
&gt; It introduced the concept of a neutral main city.
---
Why is this a bad thing? I guess they could have made it like Booty Bay and it be a PvP clusterfuck but that would make for a pretty poor experience for everyone.
---
This Stress Test is US/AU Only.
---
If you have a US Account (Such as a starter account) attached to your battle.net account this is why it was flagged for Stress Test Access
---
It was like that for me too. Make sure you're under live and not beta.
---
Click the blue bar that let's you select which version of WoW you're trying to play. It is not under "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic"
---
It's a new category called "World of Warcraft Classic" under "Live", right next to your normal subscription
---
&gt; I'm a huge fan of what BC did to class specs, making all of them playable at max level content.
---
Shockadins represent
---
This is my plan, I just want to take it at my own pace and enjoy myself, once I hit max I might mess around in dungeons, but most likely i'll roll an alt and enjoy levelling that too.
---
Too soon.
---
Why the hell would they even put the game in my version box then? Would have been nicer to not have anything at all
---
It was the "beginning of the end" though, not wotlk. Flying mounts enabled you to get to those dungeons within no time aswell.
---
There is nothing to prove. You're saying things that aren't true and calling it an argument. "It's better than tier 6 so it must be miles better than tier 1" shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how this works.
---
There were some leather shoulders in MC that were simply better for healing than the druid T1 set shoulders, regardless of which bonus you broke to use them. The druid class sets were mediocre throughout vanilla, and usually you could come up with better options from nonset gear. Fundamentally the problem was that even when the gear had the right set of stats, they still had the stat budget spread out sub-optimally.
---
What about Blacksmithing? After talking with some friends I'm leaning towards mining/Eng on the main, ench/BS on the alt. I'm guessing that also requires lvl 35 for 300 BS?
---
Mods should make a sticky saying that an active NA account is required, not EU.
---
&gt; It’s notable that this June 19 stress test is a test of launch conditions for one entire region’s hardware. To make this test as helpful as possible we need to focus on only including the people of that region. This single region test allows us to better focus on any existing problems that need to be resolved and is an important pre-requisite to complete before multi-region testing.
---
&gt; In the next stress test, in July, with our single-region test complete, our plan is to test multiple regions under launch conditions, and this will include EU test realms.
---

---
I’ll be honest trust in blizzard aside. Once you add to it it won’t be the same. It just won’t. Which means in the end we’ll have people (myself included) asking for WoW Classic: Classic. Granted this is all moot if they leave classic servers stand alone and allow transfers to classic+ servers.
---
Revamping 1-60 zones was already to much work that most people won't appreciate, it's sad that people are to harsh to every expansion that not WotLk
---
Reading can be hard
---
Or, you suffer through something to keep up with your friends. Sometimes that's how relationships work, especially romantic ones.
---
It's called compromise.
---
I’m not qualified to explain why, because I didn’t enjoy population genetics when I took it and that’s the most tolerable statistics I’ve taken so far. If you’d like to know more I suggest looking up “random sampling requirements”,  or “population sampling requirements”.
---
Cregolas
---
Like most people already advocating for classic+ amiright?
---
Druid is definitely the easier of the two. You dont need to save for a mount cause you get a quick travel shapeshift form.
---
Overall they are a lot easier to level to 60. They are not as optimised in their role as a priest but they definitely have a place. Plus druids can be a pain in the ass in BGs.
---
Didnt they say that they will only have layering for launch and then remove it?
---
This please me bc I was turned off of druid tank which is what i really want to play. I just don't want to make it to 60 to be under performing.  I have been hearing lately that bear tanks can offtank most content though.
---
Lol layering comes up atleast 20 times a day
---
By definition its not impossible to be a national socialist and be tolerant of other People
---
Aslong as they are not in your country that is
---
You.... don’t see many people talking about it?
---
I can literally find at least 6 posts in the last two days about it being talked to death.
---
Please stop beating the horse. It’s dead.
---
I’m not even going to bother refuting your ridiculous claims because it’s been done ad nauseum in countless other posts.
---
It looked like dudes doing the thing they practiced together.
---
Gave me goosebumps.  Stories like this are why I am ready to come home to Classic.
---
Not seeing threads about layering? You must be new here.
---
That said. I'd be up for them dropping it after the first week or so. I don't really mind either way.
---
afaik, the plan is to drop it after a few weeks.
---
Do you have an active account?

I forgot they didn't get 1850 reqs or whatever until season 3 hahah.  Its coming back to me, because S3 is when I stopped helping rando guildies get their weapons.

Darth Vader is so much more badass in the comics and EU. He can walk onto a battlefield and force grip everyone's hearts and kill them, the shit he can plausibly do that is so much more badass is never shown in the films. It really grinds my gears.
---
If that is the case its pretty bullshit really. What a waste of a couple days off work all because they couldn't be a little bit clearer with regards to who would get in during this stress test :(
---
I wasn't trying to imply that socially outcasting assholes is not cool. It's one of the main features that made classic great. I just worry about witch hunts and smear campaigns. You know? You legitimately win an item in a premade group and they go around town saying it was reserved and you stole it or some shit.
---
The past 15 years made me cynical it seems
---
I wouldn't say introduced; Vanilla had a lot of those as well. For every Sunken Temple or BRD, there was a Stockade or a Scarlet Monastery.
---
Which was mostly good. Having pvp gear be better for pvp and pve gear better for pve is a good design.
---
Which is also good. Badges and Heroics are deeply tied together, and both of them provide genuinely challenging content to people who prefer small groups over big raids.
---
I agree with you that flying and dailies were mistakes. BC certainly wasn't flawless, but I think its improvements far outweighed its downsides.
---
WOD underappreciated? Lol
---
I call bullshit on this one.
---
Hear me out: LFR was bullshit during WoD, more so than during any other expansion. Loot was gutted, so it didn't reward regular raid trinkets or sets. If you were raiding normal or higher there was no reason to enter LFR at all except for transmog.
---
Next: anyone still clearing normal every week despite being a heroic or mythic raider is wasting their time. 
---
Titanforging in its current form wasn't a thing until the Legion pre-patch. Before that we only had warforging (+6 ilvl), socket and tertiary procs. 6.2 did start plaguing us with titanforging, but it was only limited to the newly introduced mythic difficulty for dungeons. So you had no reason to run normal mode except if you didn't have your tier set complete or were missing your class trinket in HFC.
---
People still play vanilla pservers, uo (old style) pservers, project 1999, regular diablo, diablo 2. Most of the games I play are over a decade old some over 2 decades. Still boot em up and play em monthly.
---
I'm a rogue
---
I remember that the macro sometimes didn’t work when you were running while doing it (probably because the loot window closed too fast even with autoloot on). It worked 100% if you were standing still, even if it’s only for the millisecond you push the button. 
---
Does anyone remember that too? 
---
And does it still sometimes not work in the beta?
---
Can you screenshot please?
---
I think they were also taken out in the fire.
---
Yeah if you're not a fan it wouldn't really do anything for you, being one myself it's probably in my top 5 favorite scenes ever.
---
imho while gear makes things "faceroll" it doesnt mean it is everyting. if u play rly good and use ur char to the limits with engineering etc. u will still rock.
---
and when ppl refer to gear dependent they are talking about aq40+ gear or at least late bwl gear. till this gear is even in the game or people have several pieces on them it will take a long time und u might already rock ur rank 12-13 gear. 
---
if u have unlimited time maybe u can throw in some raiding for anathema. i think anathema really rocks for spriests! i mean, there is in general at least one spriest spot some guilds will run more. the competition for gear is high though.
---
so i wouldnt worry about that too much.
---
what i would worry more is about all those streamers and private server freaks that want to go for rank14. i think it will be even harder than it was in classic, given how many people want to try that. 
---
so there will not only be insane grinds but i bet a lot of collusion, corruption and people exploiting every bit of the system.
---
second thing is u wont be able to make rank 12-14 without a premade group. 
---
now comes the problem, that many of those premade groups are made of those private server elitists that think there is excactly one meta and one meta only and they figured it out and there is no spriest in it.

like all those folks that say u cant play wl on alliance side cause of all the horde undeads.
---
doenst mean at all u should change ur class though, those ppl are idiots. just to keep in mind what might await u.
---
if u want to be spriest and like the idea more go for it and good luck with the grind. if u enjoy something more u will be better at it anyway.
---
I know a dude doing the major in stats. They’re a fuckin strange bunch. I’ll keep to cells, at least they don’t drown me in maths.
---
What a new and refreshing take on this topic.
---
Where did I say that? I said that the gain is so good that it's the BiS at T6 (It's BiS all the way to T6) I've also mentioned the mountains of data that's been shown in game that this is a sustainable method of DPS all you've done is "Nah, you don't know what you're talking about"
---
Another one of these posts good lord
---
What a horrible meme. There is no controversy with BFA, it just sucks. The Last Jedi is controversial because there is disagreement.
---
Guild drama? Yo it's a fucking video game.
---
Yeah im EU, imma kms.... I fucking hate this
---
Plan on constantly drinking. Fight one guy, drink. Put up dots, they get dispelled, put up dots again, they get dispelled, drink. Repeat
---
You can keep in touch with friends outside of WoW you know.
---
&gt; i think modern wow got it so wrong w/regards to this, it's not the same to have 4 different difficulties of the same raid as it was to have OG naxx, or sunwell plateau, etc. That epicness factor just isn't there when it's just a harder version of the same raid that you've already seen all of and stomped on LFR/normal
---
I agree, although I have to say I didn't mind at all the Sartharius/Ulduar way where there were more difficulties but instead of clicking a UI option you had to do something differently in the fight so it felt natural and part of 1 encounter.
---
They did say that way of hard modes wasn't sustainable though as it'd take too much time to make and obviously it does limit your design choices.
---
Love this! Classic is already making WoW great again. 💜
---
Don’t fall for it people.
---
Yeah was looking forward to it, suppose we can’t play then :(
---
Around when Phase 1 completes and world bosses are introduced is the current timeline.
---
No thanks I pref not being in a guild were people farm thousands of gold just to get a loot advantage.
---
maybe but if they dont do it, the chinese will. those accounts are playing until rag dies.
---
&gt; You have given no examples of how twinks ruin battlegrounds aside ad homenim that I or other twinks are douchbags.
---
It's a bit late to run this line, isn't it? If you want to try to waste someone's time pretending that you don't know what you did wrong, the time to do that is before you spend multiple posts defending it.
---
&gt; You sound like someone who likes to march around with a pink hat fighting against the patriarchy.
---
You sound like someone who likes to wear a red hat, browse /pol and complain that white women are race traitors for not having sex with you.
---
Come on now goosebumps.
---
they said it will be kept till it isnt needed any more. (they did hint at about a month of it lasting though). its in one of the Dev posts but cant remember which one.
---
Stop with these posts ffs. Everyone acts like the sub is hardcore, but where the fuck do you see that? All I see is ‘hey guys stop and smell the roses blabla’ shut uupppp
---
As a Rouge player, i concur.
---
Until you're wiping on C'thun because meme specs are all running oom/cant dps tentacles fast enough.
---
You really don't know where a guild will end up, so just be aware of that and be willing to sacrifice progression and death runs for some people to be playing their subpar spec.
---
That'a a good plan, but I wonder if there's any way to get dystopian &amp; systematize it. Some addon that you can send/retrieve a player's ratings from some 3rd party database
---
It does if we use him as a barometer for the next expansion. If he chooses to buy it we'll know it's bad.
---
I wonder what it means?!?!
---
Alliance has one of the most powerful rogue racials, escape artist! I played at the end of Vanilla and honestly gnome is amazing. I did 21/8/22 and while it’s very cooldown dependent you will destroy people when you have them, and then go hide while you wait for them to come back.
---
Is your active subscription in the Americas region?
---
Are you EU? They said only US in this stress-test. You won't get a refund.
---
Thanks for the info, would really like to hit the ground running without having to mess about with ui, keybinds and all that jazz.
---
this hasn't been happening on the private servers I played on
---
No hybrid class in vanilla performs a role better than a non-hybrid version of that role. Full stop. You will never tank better than a warrior, do more dps than a mage or heal better than the priest as a hybrid.
---
You can definitely be viable, but you will never be able to outclass the non-hybrids.
---
That is quite literally the trade off for hybrid classes. Paladins didnt tank or dps much in Vanilla, they were only really wanted as healers.
---
Druids will be wanted as healers and tanks. Shamans will be wanted as healers.
---
None of the hybrids will get a lot of love for their dps roles.
---
This just isn’t going to happen. Blizz is never going to add content to their recreation of original WoW over putting new content in retail.
---
Ever since they announced only cross realm battlegrounds I can't think of any reason to do battlegrounds pvp in classic. Basically just live battlegrounds with classic characters bleh.
---
UBRS is one thing, AQ+ your memespec will hinder the group.
---
It will absolutely be removed by the end of phase one because it disrupts the world boss spawns, but Ion has said it will probably be removed before even that point.
---
Do you not read in EU?
---
Took no chances on that, booked the whole week
---
No we don’t
---
Good point.
---
I think you've captured the pure essence of vanilla in two single reddit posts.
---
It wasn't the beginning of the end just because the name was similar, the problems weren't there in the bc system, it didn't even group people up automatically, so the interaction was the same as before. Flying mounts I agree with you on, but that's a seperate discussion.
---
I'll even agree that I don't think wrath was the problem in itself, I played most during wrath, but raid finder which is basically the real issue that sprang from this was definitely inspired by the Wrath system and not the TBC system. It's not free from critisism just because the expansion was good.
---
Why would they make “top” posts? 
---
They get downvoted to death because they are always filled with handwringing, misinformation and outright bullshit.
---
Much like this post.
---
oh, without a doubt if you had everything I said the rogue needed, the fight would definitely be heavily in your favor. I personally think spriests are one of the classes in vanilla that just have very little that counter it. I think it's never the other players fight to win, but the spriests fight to lose. To beat a spriest you either have to be a better spriest and get lucky blackout procs or rely on them to make mistakes (or resist the mindblast, fear, etc.)
---
You are amazing though, despite how op spriests can be, in the AV test they were lacking a lot of actually decent spellpower gear, whereas rogues were actually pretty geared in comparison (rogues also didn't have access to thistle tea in the test which is HUGE for dagger spec, and in every spriest duel I personally would use anything and everything to win)
---
Legion would've been really good if they just had the essence system since 7.0. Legendaries were actually a pretty good idea once you had the proper ones, the RNG fest from having to do literally anything and everything for them was the real shit stain on the wall.
---
a Gnome hit level 5 and boom! servers died, so.. whatever XD
---
I agree with you that orcs will make your life very very tough as an alliance rogue, but I would encourage you to take a big step backward and think not just about a duel-like or even bg situation. 
---
The big picture in vanilla is that pvp is everywhere and it's always in different situations. Sometimes you are getting ganked while 2 mobs are attacking you, sometimes you are getting attacked by 3 people, and sometimes you are responding to a complaint in your zone of x-lvl hunter camping me at x location. Heck, sometimes your pvp experience in vanilla consists of the challenge that is avoiding conflict to focus on other narrow goals. 
---
So considering a totally different paradigm, ill just go over a couple of counter points:
---
1. Stealth alone is incredibly powerful. Even psychologically, if you've ever been running on a path and see someone running in your direction, going stealth will often make them start aoeing or even run in the opposite direction. Did you get ganked while you were afk grabbing water? No you didn't because you're stealthed and hydrated as fuck. Are you in a group and want to provide reconnaissance? It's much better to be in stealth than just have tracking (although tracking is powerful in its own way). Maybe you can report on how much life one of them has, their levels and even what gear they are wearing. 
---
2. The tricks rogues have up their sleeves completely live up to their namesake. Are you about to get ganked by 3 people? Maybe you get a blind off, gouge another, vanish, sap one, sprint away, come back and gank one while they are low and get away again. That's something rogues can absolutely pull off and maybe it is rare but the paradigm shift is that your situations are organic. Dueling everyone and weighing out your 1v1 strengths and weaknesses is not an organic experience and I think you're trapped worrying about 5% of the game and taking the other 95% for granted. One of the most common gank scenarios is where you're fighting a mob and somebody comes in to finish you off easily. With vanish in your pocket you can actually see this happening before they get to you and prevent it from happening. 
---
3. Hunters can track you and camp your body, but only a rogue can really fuck with you. I like to sap people with no intention of killing them. The second time you get killed by a rogue (especially the same rogue in a different spot on the map) you don't feel safe anywhere. 
---
4. Consumes / gadgets &gt; meta advantages between races. In other words, a free action potion is much better than the orc racial and an iron grenade &gt; war stomp. I'm not saying you're wrong about the head to head comparisons, but I think depending on what you want to do as a rogue, you could have a great time for sure.
---
finally someone who experienced cata... i agree 100% Cata launch for me personally was great. The dungeons were actually at a level of difficulty that wasnt face roll and 3 raids on release???? I loved BoT and yes once the nerfs came in and lfr was introduced I was outta there. Came back in mop but god damn having to do Lfr after raiding because you didnt get anything was absolute aids
---
Aw shit, i missed that when reading. Damn shame.

Whyd blizzard tease me with that option :(

FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE...... Why cant they make this more clear??? And ty for the Sad answer :(
---
You arent the only who said that.
---
I plan on no lifeing the first week to get my main to max. I will slowly level my alts.
---
The whole thing would've been much simpler and saved lots of lives if they had just emailed the Death Stars plans.
---
Good way to make sure your guild members never buy consumables or enchants or end-game specs to raids.
---
It's a good loot system for pugs.
---
I have both a US and EU wow account because I've lived both places. Currently my main sub is on EU but i'm more bummed that they are still showing and allowing EU players to download the classic beta.
---
I'm cases where there is a queue, but for classic I find it hard to believe that 30 seconds will stop anything.
---
I was level 5 REEEEE

I made a snarky comment in general saying thanos had a better snap before it went right to 1. Needless to say i ate my words

---
wow that stress test didnt last very long.. welp was fun! cya in august!
---
Yes. They are reducing the server amount, becaue there is not enough stress now :)
---
You can’t give up on the World...
---
I can see the live drop downs but not the beta or stress test. I know I'm not in the beta but why is the stress test not showing up?
---
Just so you know if you link more than I think 5 names it doesn't actually notify anyone.
---
Ah, if only there was a tool you could use to... search the subreddit for information.  There's 10+ pages on topics about layering, at least.
---
Beer*
---
And then you get that gold w/o having to spend all the time farming it. If someone gears up in your guild and then quits for another guild they left a bunch of gold behind.
---
Just make an NA trial account
---
Oi, Omar.. we gonna have to time travel upside your hide? 2004 incoming… oh, wait!
---
If you plan on healing you will always be in demand, priest or shaman it wont matter. Healers are by far the least played role and finding a good one is always the biggest hassle of any group.
---
Vanilla WOW is not instant gratification like Retail WOW. You will spend a lot of time with your character.
---
Deep down you want to main a healing shaman, so main a healing shaman. You wont ever want for a group as a healer if you're even half way decent, trust me.
---
That's a real shame. I played a lot of sp in tbc and had a blast, didn't remember any mana issues.
---
&gt; Well you were talking about questing when you’re probably going to have a voidwalker out.
---
I don't know man, Felhunter is pretty legit. I always preferred having that one out. But fair enough, it's not unlikely.
---
Idk man. Maybe Void is the new meta. Back in vanilla it was always Succubus or Felhunter, both of which make mage life hell, because they can interrupt you while the Warlock is CS'ed, Polyied or whatever. The Felhunter can even dispell Poly.
---
&gt;where cone will hit both you and the Felhunter
---
That thing has like a million resists and gives the Warlock quite a lot as well. If you kill it by spamming AoE or whatever the Warlock can instantly resummon it. All the while 2-3 Dots are ticking on you, and mages are the lowest health class in the game. You just die so fast compared to the WL who shares dmg with his Demon, has tons of resists, a healthstone, a Soulstone, Drain Life ... 
---
It's not like a mage will have AP spec while leveling, or ToeP/ZG trinket insta pyro burst.
---
The WL could also sac their VW and instasummon a Felhunter. I really really think you got this wrong. Warlocks were basically made to kill mages. So were Shamans and Shadow Priests. There just wasn't much you could do.
---
Hunters could be a cool fight, Rogues and Warris were favourable matchups. But Warlocks? No way man. Not without abusing Engineering with Shadow reflector.
---
I was mythic raiding in WoD and normal wasn't a thing to me after one week, and when lfr opened it was already irrelevant
---
This is US only. If you are US then i read someone had an issue were switching to classic in the launcher switched the account to a starter account instead of their subbed account, worth checking that out.
---
Yep 4 plus hours in a raid during vanilla was very typical. You are talking to a wow og.
---
I'm gonna start with a healer and mostly do dungeons, plus a lock for solo questing.
---
Definitely taking my time, still playing BfA too (have 4 of my 12 alts at 120 now - yes I have no main :p)
---
I got to lvl 3 before they closed the servers down :D seemed to be a half hour period or so they were actually up and running
---
Well except for the fact that PVPing with a prot spec is torture. And if you are prot you’re not taking Iron Will for PVE purposes.
---
Wont work, since you need an active sub
---
I'm on 12. Cant login
---
Never used Hunter's Mark and we had 3 hunters. Not worth it when a lock could put up corruption instead.
---
Omar snapped his fingers!
---
But yeah they said servers not stressed enough, temporary shutdown .
---
They are taking two hamsters off the wheel
---
Wrong subreddit mate
---
I think you should post this on
---
r/Worldofwarcraft
---
This hurts my eyes.
---
But I like that the ESC button is Alliance. Since logging out is really their only hope against the Horde.
---
If I have an EU subscription and chance my client over to US, can I access the stress test then?
---
You join the guild you pug with and leave ur old guild behind because they are not commited
---
Trying to decide between Warrior(tank), rogue, mage, and warlock. Which ones are more guaranteed to secure a raid spot/guild spot or are they all about the same? and how is vanilla tanking compared to something like tbc as I've never tanked in vanilla only tbc+.
---
MoP and WoD should not be rated the same . WoD was doodoo
---
Two PvP servers are still up right now but that's it.
---
I'd just finished killing the last mindless zombie I needed &gt;:(
---
Took down servers with low pop
---
a gnome levelled.. the horror. They had to shut it down
---
Wow... another one of these posts and questions... ffs
---
Called mine spankybanky.
---
How can they make it anymore "more clear"?
---
It's just people like you not reading what they write, that's it.
---
Classic only 7.4 metacritic score? Wtf
---
You used AM on Vael because it is maintained consistent DPS in the face of constant spell pushback (there was a raidwise AoE damage pulse every second or two).
---
Basically, if your AM lost channeling time early, you just started the next one since mana was free. This way, you had the same DPS as if you've been channeling for the entire AM duration each time.
---
Who takes off work to play in the stress test 
---
Also who takes off work without researching and making sure they can do the thing they wanna do
---
Mage.
---
You will have 100x easier time if you go mage first. You will be able to feed your warrior money, bags, gear and consumables to make the incredible (painful) grind to 60 a bit more pleasant for the warrior/paladin.
---
Yeah I've said three times why I believe the beta isn't a good standard for this. At any rate this conversation has gone on for three days and I dont feel like we have made any headway. I hope you get what you want out of the game, have a good one.
---
Cause EU tears fuel them.
---
Either the guild takes a cut and provides the consumables or you make raid spec and consumables a requirement like any other guild.
---
This is probably the issue. You have to select the Account to log in from and it will show all accounts even inactive ones.
---
Thanks. It's exactly what vanilla was about and feels great to have that again
---
Nop, then you need to pay again for gametime on US :D
---
Bidding items with points? Who the hell designs such retarded system?
---
Here is how we did it. Each item has pre-determined value in points. When it drops everybody who want it declare so. Whoever has most points wins. He gets the item. The points are removed from his pool. This simple. No bidding.
---
At least that game is balanced... This shit was just chucked together.
---
Well that sucks 😔 thanks for the reply though!
---
You’re mixing up not understanding and not agreeing. I understand you think it’s click bait, I simply don’t agree. I know what you’re suggesting, I just don’t read it that way, nor is it my intent - click bait titles in the YouTube era are usually far more misleading and obnoxious then what I’ve said. 
---
I also wonder why people think a WoW dev would speak on the games of E3 - what’s the link there? Why would that have people clicking? “I can’t wait to hear what an ex wow dev has to say about Doom Eternal, I’m in!!! .....Fuck, click baited!!!!”
---
That breaks the sentence up when you get to that part and thus there would be no reason to think the dev is talking on anything that follows it?
---
That’s my interpretation. Let’s just disagree.
---
Rogue - Better leveling experience, great in PVP or world PVP. Not in high demand in end game raids, has a lot of competition for DPS roles.
---
Warrior - Leveling is far more tedious/fun. PVP is hit or miss, world PVP is a dangerous game solo. End game tanking though is in high demand and tanks are always hard for find so you'll have an easy time getting into dungeons and raids.
---
Of course! It's really awesome to be apart of this
---
Jokes on you I'm unemployed
---
Rogues are scissors
---
100%. I started in TBC and was rushing to catch up to Outlands. There are actually vanilla zones that I have never set foot, can't wait to go explore.
---
No Problem
---
It didn't just have a similar name you know. They removed the looking for group chat when they introduced that system. How can you say the interaction was exactly the same when they removed the lfg chat? Are you having a laugh?
---
This coupled with the flying mount was the first big step away from howe group finding was in classic. THIS was the beginning.
---
Being ported to the dungeon automatically was just the next step. Instead of taking a few moments to fly it ported you there. The difference between flying and porting is way smaller than the difference between taking boats, flight paths and riding your mount like you did in classic.
---
This is accurate. To the top you go.
---
How does standard dkp prevent this from happening?
---
I don't see the point of adding them right away. We ade using a custom release schedule anyway. If servers don't need them, then don't add them.
---
Let me just buy some gold from china
---
You have to be trolling now.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=Layering&amp;sort=new
---
There’s 7 layering related posts right there.
---
Stress Test is gone. The Beta one is for people who have Beta, or for uninstalling older StressTest clients.
---
The Live WoW Classic client is the one that will be playable today and next 2 days
---
It would be "BiS" in tier 24 or whatever tier we're on in retail if the mechanics were never changed. 20 energy is always 20 energy. The rest of your gear is irrelevant.
---
"BiS" in quotes because you actually have to use all of your mana on powershifting in order for it to be worth anything. If you don't do that, it's not worth the helm slot.
---
I gotta say though that I was never bored in MoP. It had plenty to do between gearing up with sockets for CM, farming up twinks on TI, killing Garrosh for Heirlooms or soloing Warbringers for their mounts.
---
The rares were also the best we've had ... ever? Like rares that actually required you to watch out for their abilities? The expansion was a thematical trashcan but content wise it was alright. Hated Scenarios, though. What a garbage content those were. But you HAD to do them for valor cap...
---
&gt;Not seeing threads about layering? You must be new here.
---
I checked hot and new and didn't see anything about layering. That's why I decided to post it.
---
The best part of PvP was that some classes just outperformed others. But it was a reason to learn your class so you could survive. Once the balance came it just became a faceroll and who had higher resilience.
---
The numbers are there for comparing stats.  The stats on wolfshead helm provide 0 DPS.  The equip effect is not something that can be easily calculated.  It should have an asterisk or something though to denote that it is BiS because powershifting is that powerful.
---
So, i can't join 3 or 15 because I made 3 toons on 12. Fml
---
In short: No.
---
Not till Burning Crusade.
---
Longer: Druid Bear tanking is viable but you will face stigma and ultimately warriors will still out tank you even if you can tank well enough to clear all content.
---
yes it's sharding, currently crashed.
---
And don’t forget they could cyclone the OP death knights.
---
Yeah I'm only seeing the BFA client, not the Classic one.
---
If you wipe with world buffs and 16 debuffs there are deeper issues than just meme specs.
---
I believe outside of the AV testing they were doing (were you get a level 58 premade) that they weren’t planning to go past the level 40 cap on the beta, though I could be wrong it’s just what I heard.
---
Oh good, you're catching up. Now go to YouTube and search for any of the videos showing how long powershifting can be done for as I've said for however many comments we're deep now. (Hint, it lasts long enough to create more damage than the loss on stats from the helm)
---
No offense, but have you even spent any time reading posts on this sub? Almost every other thread is someone saying this exact same thing. Kinda feels like karma farming.
---
your color scheme indicates you dont have enough keybinds ;)   very pretty though i like it
---
Entire expansion? Most expansions have better content on release than LK had
---
What, not being salty about giving special treatment to someone arbitrarily not for the improvement of the raid but to indulge the whims of that person?
---
Is the built-in script blocker on that still a binary all-or-nothing affair? I have Brave on my phone and love it, but being used to running Firefox with NoScript I simply couldn't make the switch on desktop.

How would they test layering if they disabled it........

Marriage is a scam in my mind. Being in a relationship is wonderful, which is my situation. I'll never in a life time even consider marrying someone. So that's a ridiculous example, to assume that everyone would be happy getting married. Some people are introverted, to the extreme sometimes where your real social life causes much more damage than it does to remedy it. Another one-sided, closed minded, and biased example. And your blanket statement at the end there, which has no factual support whatsoever other than your opinion, further discredits you. I can't stand that people like you who cannot see that some people DON'T LIKE THE THINGS YOU LIKE, or the idea that YOU DON'T LIKE PLAYING WOW AS MUCH AS SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU LIKE OTHER THINGS SO EVERYONE ELSE MUST HAVE ISSUES. So ridiculous!
---
What is layering?
---
yea but he's only leveling a hunter and doesn't have to worry about wep/gear progression, potions, skipping quests that aren't soloable by anything that isn't a hunter, etc
---
Maybe dwarf? I don't know
---
/u/kodatrololo should preface the whole thing by saying: "If you still to this day think Mookin's have mana issues get out!"
---
P.S. Doesn't the gear list change a bit when crit capped?
---
It's not that simple. Some classes don't need to spend nearly as much on their consumables. Other classes don't need to spend nearly as much on repair costs. It'll never be an even spread.
---
And what about the people that simply buy gold? They won't admit it, but they'll get every single piece of gear first.
---
This is just a terrible idea.
---
EPGP is the best DKP system. EPGP + Loot Council works best overall IMO
---
&gt; I wanted to know from anyone who played back then or played private servers, will it be hard work getting into groups as a Druid? I feel as though they have a bit of a stigma about them as the worst class in the game. 
---
Are you prepared to heal or tank? If you are, you'll have no trouble getting a 5 man.
---
Every word has its bias. "Memespec" is used to put them down, "fun spec" is to lift them up, but there's neutral terms like "non-meta specs".
---
There's rarely any point to arguing on the internet. At the end of the day everyone's just going to meme/bash/carry on as they were before.
---
It was kinda 'meh'. Since they scrapped a big chunk of the expansion it seemed to abruptly stop being about the Iron Horde and shift to "Legion Prequel". They could've done it better had they had more time to flesh it out (e.g. Battle for Shatt. and Farahlon).
---
Omar announced a shutdown on Realm 5 where I was, so not sure if that's a crash or a planned downtime for tweaks.
---
You have NOT in the title twice implying you can only access beta as EU.
---
Yes, entire expansions. The very vast majority agree that every expansion post wotlk was worse than wotlk.
---
Confusing title
---
I am on 12 as well, wondering if it will come back or not
---
I’m actually concerned I might lose my job if I get addicted to classic.
---
When WoW came out I was a senior in college and had winter break and my first real job only required 40 hours. But now I’ve worked hard to get to where I’m at today but now I have to travel for work and sometimes work late hours. What if I start saying no to business trips or oversleep mornings because I need to grind honor? 😬
---
You missed #NOCHANGES
---
Standard DKP is no better.
---
Is there a blue post for this?
---
I gotcha.
---
Literally the only good thing from WoD was the cosmetic stormwind set. I'm a roleplayer and chainmail on all armor classes is 10/10. And Vigilants, those were cool. Everything else sucked.
---
Nope me and my IRL friends have literally been looking forward to launch before classic was even announced at blizzcon. Were taking off work Tuesday-Friday and going absolute ham on this shit. I plan on being somehwere between 45 and 50 by the end of the weekend.
---
You need an active subscription to join the stress test - correct?  It shows that I can have it downloaded and installed.
---
Honestly, everybody who says Loot Council is the best system does so because he assumes he will get more loot in such system. That his value and contribution to the guild will be recognized and rewarded. Noone would advocate it if they knew beforehand it meant they are getting less loot. And some people WILL get less loot.

Guild is not a corporation. People play WoW to have fun. The main goal of RPG is to develop your character. Loot is essential element of development. Point-based systems give players agency. They feel they are working towards an upgrade. From single player's perspective Loot Council could just as well be BFA style slot machine.
---
Cata in the same category as MoP? Cata was still, kinda, good imo, especially pvp wise.
---
The end game is about raiding, and for a lot of people mmos are about the end game.  Anyone asking about what's good for raiding are probably interested in the end game.
---
Actually around 1000 possible keybinds, i can build the firmware to the keyboard to have modifiers to different layers of keys!
---
If you really want to piss people off, use Succubus, here's how:
---
1. Stun the enemy, either with grenades or Tidal Charm if you have it.
---
2. Use Seduce.
---
3. Cast Curse of Elements.
---
4. Cast Soulfire.
---
5. If the enemy is still alive, follow up with a quick Death Coil then Immolate and Conflagrate for some quick burst.
---
6. Kite around with Fear + DoTs if needed but most classes would be dead by this point.
---
Congratulations, you now have your very own stun lock!
---
I don't see what is so bad about it sure a couple people might farm their way to gear first but that is just going to pay off for the rest of the guild. It makes DKP tangible and usable on crafted gear. The guild can sell spots to pugs to benefit the guild when content is on farm. Yes people will farm for gold and get shit first but I'm going to benefit from it.
---
I say that because people used trade chat way more than the TBC LFG system and the name of the chat channel doesn't impact the social experience. Flying was the beginning of flying, and flying is bad, sure, but forcing people into trade chat was not the first step on the path to teleporting to dungeons. There's a milion different ways they could have taken that system, not to mention leaving it alone, and it would have been fine.
---
Wow has been an absolute joke since the implementation of garrisons and the endless artifact/legendary grind.
---
I played 20-35 hours a week from November 04 to WoD release. I quit the game like a month to the day from WoD release.
---
WotLK was the beginning of the end. And the end lasted a LONG time.
---
Seriously why the hell do I have no option to install. Only see legion
---
There were server messages in game.
---
Hopefully he learned something.
---
My Gnome mage was looting the quest mob in the cave. I am for sure dead when they boot the servers back up later.
---
They were added in 1.12 which was the final patch of Vanilla.
---
2.0 was the pre-tbc patch where they got rid of the honor system.
---
I didn't play all healer classes in Vanilla/Classic. Those that I played are paladin and priest (mostly PvP/BGs). I like them both. I couldn't tell which one is better but both of are suited for my playstyle.
---
Otherwise, I played all healer classes 5years ago for free2play (level cap: lvl20). There are all good. But I prefered my feral druid as support class/healer: stealth and travel form are awesome.
---
&gt; Frost reflect last what 5 seconds? Wait, and then trap. 
---
Trap with what? You used Scatter. Or if you didn't you had a rogue blowing you up for 5 seconds, which is enough to get in a Kidney. If he has Adrenaline on ( and he should ) he can pretty much kill you in those 5 seconds.
---
&gt; Get distance,
---
Crippling poison on you.
---
&gt;Blink is only 20 yards you start at 41
---
That's assuming you get the drop on them and not the other way around. You could start at 5.
---
&gt;If they iceblock your scatter, you still gained about 2 seconds, you wait for their fireblast, then turn on cheetah.
---
Why would they fireblast you when they can poly you and run in and use Frost Nova? Then you're deadzoned and dead.
---
And most of us have done it already and can’t wait to get back in.
---
&gt; Well ally does have dwarf Priest which can give their entire battle group fear Ward on a 30 second cool down.
---
Yea I think in organized PvP alliance may have had an edge overall, but it didn't particularly shaft Warlocks, as dispells and teamplay made CC like fear way less impactful in the first place, so it wasn't so bad if it didn't work. I think I mentioned that in my first post (that WotF is not as bad in organized PvP)

Hi, /u/rekki_T
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2n5z6/for_the_current_stress_test_ive_downloaded/). 
---
Yep, active required
---
I disagree, to a point. 
---
An ass-ton of people are going to play Classic when it first comes out. 
---
You'll have your hardcore players.
---
Your nostalgia seekers. 
---
Your "never played Vanilla, but curious" players. 
---
That is precisely why Blizzard is handling the launch of the game using layering tech, because it would be a nightmare without it. Without layering they would likely lose all but the most hardcore players because those last two groups likely wouldn't wait around for servers to work. 
---
The problem is that the issues the game had before, are ***still*** present in the game. People were quitting around level 10 for a number of reasons. 
---
a) Quests where typically all over the place. So some quests had you go way out of the way. If you didn't want to do that you could grind out mobs. 
---
b) Quest rewards were typically bad. Especially starting out 1-15, quest rewards were bad. Classes that rely heavily on gear are hurt more than usual. 
---
c) Mobs in general were "harder". Harder in the sense that every where you go is a danger to your character. Primarily because of "bad luck". I've been playing beta since it opened, and there are times when I am fighting a mob and I miss a yellow attack 3-4 times ***in a row*** on mobs 1-2 levels lower than I am. Parry, Dodge, Miss, Parry. It never puts me close to death, but it can be frustrating and can be fatal in the wrong situation. 
---
A lot of the classes are also not optimized and feel rather "incomplete". Start a rogue at level 1. My 1-10 leveling experience rarely had me ***ever*** going stealth. It's just not worth it. You walk too slow, and the damage from backstab just isn't enough to justify it. So the optimal setup I went to was pulling with Throw Weapon and then SS them down. I actually recommend players who start Rogues pull like this, at least starting out. 
---
Or Paladins. Prot Paladins ***DO NOT*** get a taunt. Ever. Druids and Warriors get their Taunt at level 10. They also get some form of AoE at level 10. Paladins get ***one*** AoE spell at level 20, if they specc 11 points into Holy. So you have to forgo your build into Prot in order to even be competitive to other Tanks TEN levels after they can already do what you can do. 
---
Vanilla was Blizzard's first draft of World of Warcraft. It has some good parts, and some bad parts. As a whole, it's not a very good "essay", but it sure does have a couple of paragraphs that stand out. 
---
Which I feel is where most people that ***really*** like Classic are coming from.
---
No sub no classic
---
Leveling was another enjoyable thing about WOD I think a lot of people forget. The zones were mostly all really good, progressing your garrison was fun (this was before we realized we were going to be spending all our time in it), and the treasures and bonus objectives were cool. Definitely not top tier leveling experience, but a huge leap above BFA leveling.
---
Don't think those are pre-bis raid items though. Proposing a way for paladins to tank when guilds are starting to raid
---
Has Wargen...Not Vanilla nice try
---
I love it so much that I've done it many times already and will do it again multiple times in Classic. It's only the very first character that I'll rush to 60 to not get stuck with the majority of people leveling and avoid the first wave of world pvp (which is simply not fun to me).
---
They said "omar snaps his fingers"
---
"shutting down in 15"
---
"shutting down in 1"
---
"shutting down in 45"
---
"shutting down in 30"
---
"shutting down in 10"
---
you get the point, at no time did they said "please focus your efforts on 3 and 15" or something
---
Nationalsocialism would definetly not end up as communism. Like 0% chance.
---
Communism could be achievable on a global scale but would be very tricky to pull off and would most likely require one nation or a very small amount owning all the land on the globe. This is very unlikely but saying that it has to end in genocide is ignorant.
---
Im rightleaning i.e not a communist
---
Loot Lists &gt; all the rest.
---
Did have authentication then :(
---
Warlock has some of the best lore in the game. The man who designed it even said they wanted to do something different and make you feel like you were a part of something different than the rest of the pack.
---
i believe what happened is we were only suppose to make names. but something bugged and we got to play. 2 hours b4 the actual stress test, so they shut it all down
---
Still trying to figure out how to log in, just re-subbed, am now installing it. I needed to install the full 60gb install, is that correct? Was hoping it'd be smaller.
---
You should make a note for each of the bloodvine pieces that they become BiS as a set.
---
I never visited my servers offocial wow sub forum. I'd wager many others didnt either. Certain big guilds had forums that were way more frequented even by non guildies.
---
Also Blizzard would under no circumstances allow shaming players on their forum, so that's out of the question for "Player X just ninja'd, please blacklist" threads
---
Rolling paladin female dwarf since 2006.
---
They had to many servers up and people spreaded out so they shut all but two down for a while to stress the servers then will bring them back up
---
I swear this message never appeared on 12.
---
As a rerurning player who left at the very emd of wotlk and just came back to wow because of classic - leveling is a shitshow currently. Leveled two chars to 120 and the funniest part i think was in legion killing spider critters with sub 400hp yielded about 75-80% of regular mobs xp. So i leveld two levels by just oneshotting spiders because invasion wasnt up
---
Here is how you fix that
---
How is undead better for pve? You don't gain anything for pve.
---
I like the style of your video's. No bullshit intro and distracting music, or an annoying webcam in the corner of your screen. Just straight to the point and well explained. Keep it up!
---
The poor noob outside stormwind just waved at you and gets one shotted. Nothing more classic than this.
---
Damn, that does sound like it sucks.  Maybe they could just not stream and then it wouldn’t suck?
---
Are you sure ? 1.5 sec for Healing touch rank 3 ?  I would rather say 2 sec, not less even with Improved Healing touch.
---
My dude the game is very old and tons of new stuff has come about since back in teh day mostly from people looking to try something new and challenge themselves with such a trivialized game. take a gander at Gideoonai and Caperfin on youtube some very cool and innovative stuff.
---
Yea it surely was. 
---
WoD was nice for bringing your profs up to speed (you know, those 250/600 profs on your twinks that you never bothered to level up?) but other than that they were just ... streamlined to the point of utter boredom. Like everything in the game. Streamline because it's easier to maintain.
---
WoD had some insanely good looking gear. but thats where id stop finding positives as well.
---
Pickup mining so you can track nodes and fire flares at them, the little buggers love camping them.
---
How did ya'll like Rogue One? I thought it was awesome and it definitely belongs up there with the others.
---
Absolutely, Druid/Mage is an amazing combo. You'd have a much easier time finding groups that way too.
---
Just be warned you're sacrificing any hope of burst damage by going Druid — even deep feral is mostly about attrition. Balance is really not viable in pvp unless you get completely ignored. But with your mage friend you'll have plenty of damage and will be running circles around most opponents.
---
The exploit leads to benefit for all other members.
---
Agreed. WoW has always hewn closer to theme park design than anything resembling a proper sandbox, but the Cata revamp *really* put the entire world on rails.
---
Granted, that started all the way back in TBC with the introduction of quest hubs and smoother leveling paths, but at least the old world still existed to get lost in even if you vastly outleveled everything in it.
---
lmao i dont know if 1000 is enough /s
---
Odd because I was on 12, idk what's up with that- people saw that Omar message too... so who the hell knows what's going on with the servers / layering at this point.
---
Also:
---
Episdoe 1 under appreciated lmaooooo ok dude
---
And now we've come full circle. Like I said in my very first post that you replied to, there are better things to spend your mana on. DPS isn't everything.
---
Someone who clearly has an abundance of pro built up and a deadline to use it or lose it.
---
guilds will bring enhancement shamans guilds will bring feral dps, especially casual guilds. and there will be tons of pug raids. classic isnt that hard, especially with all our knowledge and experience we have today. 
---
hell we had a frostmage in naxx. half of our priests pretended to be holy while they were shadow during bwl. we had 1-2 enhancements, 1 feral dps/tank, 1 shadow and a trillion of hunters. and we downed several bosses in naxx. 
---
dont listen to those elitists that say if u want to dps u go orc warrior/rogue or troll mage and ofc u need engi and 700 consumables and 300 worldbuffs and bis gear. 
---
those are either ppl that want to be the first on their server to clear naxx or are corrupted by videos of those private server nerds or are simply clueless at all.
---
guilds will bring hybrid offspecs. maybe not a lot of slots but there will be slots. ur raid maybe wont be as fast as the best guild on the server and maybe u wont clear naxx full. 
---
and if they dont let u in make a raid on ur own.
---
however, enhancement in classic cant dual wield. ;)
---
He was talking about content phases. Poor wording for sure though.
---
Not in the fucking slightest.
---
He looked at us funny! Something about moo moo and green dude. But in fairness...he did auto attack my friend lol
---
Lol the stress test was supposed to open at 2. Which is when it opened...
---
Then theres people like me who play a hardcore amount of hours with a casual mindset. We honestly just don't want to deal with the cancer that is meta worship.
---
For classic probably not lmao
---
&gt; unless you're Alliance. Then you can fuck right off. =D
---
Amen brother.
---
5pm EST
---
Yhul isn't a bad name tbh. For The Horde
---
You're entitled to play a0/0/0 warlock &amp; a leather-only "barbarian" tank, but people don't like having to pick up the slack on your unnecessary handicap. I don't want to give anyone a false impression about what reaction they'll get if they want to be a holy warrior dps.
---
No, but if you're going to sit at 100% mana you're wasting dps, and again, Wolfshead powershifting will out dps the alternative very quickly. It is possible to powershift responsibly, not everything in WoW is 1s and 0s even if binary is the base.
---
It is still work time for 75% of america, the other 25% are sitting in traffic. It was a poor choice of times
---
1 FC (usually druid)
---
9 people who can fight in mid AND focus down EFC.
---
My favorite activity in Wow is just exploring and doing the quests, and READING the quests.
---
I think they'll space things out decently just to extend server life. They have a limited amount of content, and want to get their money's worth out of it. Also, spacing the content out allows them more time to figure out / develop what comes after we run out of content, whether that's tbc, classic + or classic seasons in a similiar fashion to diablo ladder seasons.
---
This. Surely 7-8 on a Friday evening??
---
Mostly because the value of the crit and hit increased with the spell power. This means that the more you have spell damage, the more crit and hit have value.  
---
Also, keep in mind that at AQ phase, you will unlock Starfire rank 7 !
---
Very strange since it will be closing by then. Idk what blizzard is doing lol.
---
having a stress test at 2pm is a real galaxy brain idea
---
Cataclysm was not underappreciated it was mediocre, MoP was good from a character balance and talent level I played more MoP then both Cataclysm and WoD combined, WoD was just garbage there was no looking back and missing that even in BFA. Legion wasn't amazing but compared to Cata/WoD/BFA it is in the top 4 easily with only lesser expansions to follow and WoD in the trash can.

Cata I can agree with, but WoD? hahahah

I need to farm the best names for RPing.
---
Horde Warlocks are the shit.
---
Everyone and their Dad will be playing a mage.
---
Hunters are a lot of fun but they got shit on as "huntards" so it can be hard to get people to take your DPS seriously unless you're really good.
---
WATER IS WET TOO GUYZ
---
Most wont sub for a stress test I think
---
Think that's because their layering is "good" at the moment and I think that's what they are going for, but hey I'd love the playable experience considering layering is guaranteed on launch.
---
why not let other people enjoy them though? why do you need 50-100 names?
---
as i recall, dust has a higher DE chance from armor and essence has a higher DE chance from weapons.  Find a weapon to DE.
---
I feel like Thunderclap is much more likely during AQ with the set bonus?
---
Absolutely 100% against. I can abide it if the game is free.
---
Why should anyone get it just for being more wealthy in real life? Or for buying novelty cards? Should people who love WoW tank money into something they have no interest in to get something cool in game? Why not just turn it into a cool quest or a boss drop or any other number of fun in game mechanics which aren't meant to hawk people out of their pennies. It's completely unnecessary and needlessly adds an extra barrier to poorer players.
---
I'm of the position that so long as you can afford your sub, everyone is equal. Once you're in you are a citizen of Azeroth with the same opportunities as anyone else. If the sub can't cover Blizzards server and development costs than up the sub.
---
But realistically it can and this is just a shameless attempt to branch out and lower risk at the communities cost. I.e making sure the collectors subsidise their expansion rather than just releasing a TGC
---
Same with me I honestly couldnt see myself using my freetime outside of socializing to do anything other than wow.
---
but after that firelands patch hit, i just felt.........eh. I think im done. And i dont even think it was the act of playing wow I was done with the game just felt....different, kind of dry.
---
I noticed that the expacs with earthtone themes are usually the worst lol. Cata, WoD, BFA.
---
COINCIDENCE?
---
Yeah they started at a weird time, I'm guessing they realized the should open the other servers up when it gets closer to prime time.
---
If you truly think these things. You are completely ignorant of human nature. The idea you could centrally plan an entire worlds economy from a government office is beyond laughable. As far as National Socialism, never ending in Communism no that's exactly how it always ends at the ass end of recession. If you have millions of people reliant on the government for something then suddenly the government is too poor to supply it. They aren't going to simply go, well guys we tried sorry starve this year. They are simply going to take over industry after industry in an attempt to save their vaunted safety nets. Have you ever met a politician to put the country before re-election. Of course not.
---
“I don’t know how to do math or I’m too lazy to do it myself so I’m just going to believe shit that is clearly wrong.”   Fixed. 
---
Doubt whatever you want but he’s right.
---
whoa why are you lumping disc dps priests with oomkins? You sacrifice a bit of dps/healing compared to holy for a lot higher survivability, utility, and world pvp viability. Still, having zero downtime, it has to be one of the most efficient specs in the game for leveling.
---
Are people forgetting that you have to farm 1800 silithus elementals before doing mc to get the serpent hands quest for the douse??

My pulldown box has never changed. What on earth am I doing wrong ?
---
Yikes. Lock it is...
---
Do you play wow on mac or what
---
Yeah many people praise it just for having Arthas, doesn't make it best
---
I would say that the process was extremely smooth. There were plenty of people, enough to really bottle neck many of them... but not so stupid that you cant do anything. If the launch goes that smoothly, I will be EXTREMELY happy.
---
Except Cataclysm was shit and Mists of Pandaria is hardly "under appreciated".
---
Tauren: chuckle
---
I’m not a big Star Wars nerd but I actually enjoyed The Last Jedi while I really didn’t like the one before that.  
---
And yes I have seen all of them.
---
That's still not going to be enough.
---
I buy as much gold as I want, let's say at 100g for $5. That only gives everyone else in the raid ~2.5g. If there are 10 people in the raid that would bid on my items, that costs me an extra $1.75.
---
Even if I need to have 1000g per item, that's only $67.50 per piece of loot.
---
And you'd have to distribute the gold after EVERY piece of loot, otherwise the price wouldn't increase.
---
Every single piece of gear I want, would go to me. I'd ride the gravy train until I had all the gear I wanted (or more likely, the guild disbands), and then get poached by a better guild.
---
Okay then don’t play lol
---
I liked it, we need more side story stuff, the EU was that until Disney retconned it all away.
---
Tbh wrath wasn't really classic, it was more of a transition into modern wow
---
&gt; It's one of my favourite expansions because I was a heavily invested hardcore Mythic raider. I realize that's the cup of tea of a tiny, miniscule minority, but WoD had (at the time) the absolute best ingame cinematics (Talador cinematic blows Jade Forest out of the water), amazing questlines, storytelling, music, environment, and the best ever starting raids (IMO) than the usual first tier for pretty much any expansion before it, ie Blackrock Foundry and Highmaul. It had absolutely everything I could want from World of Warcraft... other than community, which is where it took an even greater nosedive due to everyone afking in their Garrisons, and when my realm was merged ('Connected') with two others.
---
Well the expac didn't really crash until the first big content patch brought nothing but a selfie cam and twitter connection. The expansion just offered NOTHING after the initial launch content. And when they finally added content, it was only raids. And another garrison mission table. Like how fucking hilarious was that? 
---
Pandaria had PLENTY to do. Challenge Modes, gearing up for Challenge modes (socket gear) farming Zandalari Warbringers, doing raids (duh), farming  nat pagle rep for the waterstrider, questing through thunder island (whatever the name was), farming rares on TI for some sweet rare drops, speaking of rares: farming those (300%xp pot)
---
There was TONS to do. WoD? Raid or fuck off. Which I did. Fuck off I mean. There was shit to do after you leveled to max, picked all treasures and finished the Dungeons. 
---
Challenge mode gave full rewards after finishing with a single char so no reason to keep doing them, sockets were disabled so no reason to farm special gear ... everything was crap after the initial launch. The launch was pretty damn good, but once you were done leveling and gearing up for raids there was literally just raiding and by all metrics that Blizzard ever published raiding has always been a niche thing. I've always enjoyed raiding in the past but when it's the only thing in the game it's just not enough for me.
---
And there was plenty to do for other expansions as well. WoD didn't even add a single new dungeon during it's lifespan.
---
Oh also on point #4, you should basically always have 10-20 thistle tea on you. If yoi are dagger you can get an ambush and 3 backstabs in basically 4 gdc if you use tea and have a way of tracking your energy ticks. That or cheap shot and 3 backstabs, after that one big evisc
---
goddamm poetry right there! BobbyB!!
---
What about the significant drop in subscribers during every single expansion bar legion?
---
It was the worst expansion for story thus far imo, it was full of ideas that could have been cool but didn't have any commitment put into them. 
---
They started it with a time travel plot and then made it so that none of the cool parts of time travel stories could happen. They billed the opening as a suicide mission that we'll probably not be able to come back from, and then immediately erected portals to SW and org so that it never really meant anything. And they had quite a few dangling quest threads that could be interesting that they then did nothing with.
---
Not if you automate it. It takes an hour for a recruit to fill out their list. The only thing the leader needs is to update attendance. Everything else is programmed.
---
Calling WoW Classic a nostalgia money grab is like calling the restoration of Rome a tourism project.
---
What do you mean by lower third? 
---
I've easily tanked SM Cath as a holy paladin at level 39. Is that a lower third dungeon? Or is 39 over leveled? Or holy a tanking spec?
---
Now you're spending 100% mana to rebuff and resummon a pet.
---
Awsome mate, on many levels !
---
I tried getting my 2005 account recovered but blizzard replied they can't give it to me for the account was registered on my older brother's name.
---
He would need to create a [battle.net](https://battle.net) account on his name and then they'd restore it
---
I'm kinda out of touch with my brother, he also doesn't game at all, so I'm not going to bother. What do I need it for anyways when starting Classic?
---
This. Stuck at work right now...
---
I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume half the players who plan on playing classic release don't give a fuck about stress testing, because, you know, it's not the actual release.
---
I feel I need to tell you. The stolen silver is an item you loot at the end of the little valley the Raptors are in. It's always there
---
He one shotted a lowbie human for waving at him...?  That’s the least friendly Tauren I’ve ever seen, you Hordies really are monsters!!! /s
---
Ah, TBC heroics! Remember the elite rogues in shattered halls that would one shot party members? Or those migraine inducing pulls in shadow labs? Fun times those were!
---
Cataclysm had severely shallower talent trees, so you had fewer combinations of choices available overall.
---
But in addition to that, it:
---
- Added "spec" as a game construct, and gave/removed a package of abilities based on that. This basically made the cookie-cutter model completely mandatory, and took nearly all choices away from the player.
---
- Forced you to go all the way to the bottom of one talent tree before you could spend any points in a second. Again, less choice and control for players.
---
- Added the spec-specific autostat of Mastery. "Here, have a generic stat that does whatever it is that we think your spec should want. No decisions on your part, no different stats for different situations or goals, we'll just handle it all for you."
---
A very small benefit that will never allow them to outbid the exploiter.
---
Warrior, Mage and Warlock will have an easier time securing a guild/raid spot. Closely followed by rogues.
---
It all depends on the server population of class distribution and what your guild needs.
---
I would recommend to play mage if it is in your line up of options. It is easily the king of vanilla.
---
As far as tanking it’s generall the same as TBC you will be able to learn and pick it up fine if that is what you’d want to do.

I know I'm playing a priest, I'm just trying to decide between horde (undead) or alliance (dwarf).
---
I raided as a NE rogue but was a dwarf priest main by the time TBC came out (although I didn't complete much vanilla raid content as a priest). Stopped playing early in TBC. I've basically come down to Dwarf for the nostalgia, or Undead for seeing the other side and the sweet, sweet animations.
---
I leaned towards PvP during vanilla but probably focusing more on PvE this time around.

Lets do a survey and find out?

And you can go to Outland instead

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2nbwo/omar_is_about_to_bring_more_stress/). 
---
No one knows.
---
BFA raids are good too so?
---
It's not possible to "underappreciate" those films.  They are objectively terrible.  I didn't play those expansions, so I can't speak to them.
---
Yeah that was easily the best out of the prequels
---
Much like muffalowing and yourself said, the knee jerk reaction seems to be that it was a stream sniper, and how are they to differentiate between the two? Also, situations where the person who kills the streamer legitimately doesn’t know who they are by name recognition? In those instances it will be a shame to have any negative repercussions come their way.
---
I started on launch day when there were no guides and no meta. I just can't use guides now because it feels like someone else is playing the game for me.
---
We don’t know just sit back enjoy the ride and see what happens 3 years down the line
---
Classic will come to an end when all of the classic content has been released. Nothing else makes sense unless they eventually roll into TBC.
---
But you couldn't use that for calling out players could you? Isn't that against Blizz forum rules?
---
I’m completely stuck between Mage and Warlock. 
---
I want to primarily have fun in PvP—BGs and World. I love utility and flavour abilities. I like the ability to solo, as I’ll be playing on my own. 
---
I’m not all that fussed on PvE, but I’d still like to do a bit of raiding and be viable.
---
"under appreciated in their time" I feel like RedLetterMedia / Mr. Plinkett would have something to say about Star Wars Ep 1-3
---
why worry about it now? It's going to be years before anyone clears naxx and then probably another year for casuals to clear it.
---
Lol I was going to do this too
---
But I think your poll needs to have an option that says "oh yes absolutely but its not a problem cause its AWESOME"
---
Whatcha hoping for?
---
Or put on a 30sec/2 minute delay. But think of the children!
---
Of course, I am! I sincerely appreciate it too!
---
Who cares?
---
After 2 years, who cares? They either release TBC, make Retail better, or they simply shut Classic down. Still had a great 2 years.
---
Yoiu don't refuse to see a great movie because the sequel might suck or might not get made at all.
---
Why take the time to deconstruct his points via individual quotes...then give literally no opposing arguments? Your rebuttal is literally "nuh uh!"
---
You debate like a 5 year old. I loved WotLK too, but your rose-colored glasses are way too thick, and you're being obtuse with absolutely no counter-points.
---
Im saying it is important if you are not eu, (so either Us or OCE) and you cannot enter beta. Not so sure what is complicated about that..
---
Just remember it's gonna get wiped so you might not be as lucky on actual launch
---
&gt; I think because of the beta, hype is already slowly dying down.
---
People for whom the hype is dying, would never have made it to 60 anyway
---
&gt; And there’s something special about endgame content in WoW.
---
I agree. But for a 15 year old game it's not *seeing* the content, it's *playing it yourself with your own character* that makes it special
---
&gt; I think if they raise lvl cap to 60, and people will be forced to watch streamers clear endgame content for weeks until release, many people will lose their hype for the game.
---
Forced? Nah, as I said above, they would never have made it to 60 in the first place
---
&gt; I hope Blizzard realizes that and does all of their 60 testing in-house.
---
Doesn't matter either way to me.
---
Maybe I am still missing the point, that younger gamers need this twitch hype to get excited for classic... Then again, I've said above what I think about that crowd.
---
If there is a large percentage of them who exceed my expectations and level to 60, join a raiding guild, and show up on time for weeks on end to experience the content. Well yay for me and for them, eh?
---
What I can tell you for sure is that about 60 of my friends are going to sub to WoW for the first time in 5-8 years just for Classic, and I can count on one hand how many of them watch twitch.
---
Sadface.  I want to play, but I am not renewing my sub for 2 days of stress testing.  I will just have to wait for the official launch.
---
I like that even tho it was dif servers you could akwats find a familiar name as its not all the server combined but just a few to each battle group i really wished the kept it
---
&gt; There will be many people in battlegrounds who are the same, so you won’t get crushed all the time.
---
This likely will not be the case. Blizzard has actually had a hard time getting people to want to get in to PvP over the many years. 
---
It's why the pvp system has gone over so many changes over the year to eventually what they have now. That is, whenever you get into pvp combat with another player, both of your ilvls are immediately set to be equal. If you have gear that's better than the default ilvl, it gives you a boost in stats, if you follow. 
---
So the playing field is relatively even, so it comes down to skill rather than gear. Although as I mentioned, if you have better gear it does give you an edge. 
---
&gt; The levelling experience in retail is shit, the scaling makes it so you never feel like you’re getting stronger or progressing.
---
Oh, there's pros and cons. 
---
Pros: 1) Because of scaling you can almost always party with a friend no matter what level they are (in general). So if you are level 25 and you want to help your level 14 friend, you can. Both of you can enjoy the game together and not be a burden on each other. 
---
2) Because of scaling, you'll almost always be in the right area no matter what you do. So if you end up running a dungeon 6 times in a row, and level up like 3-4 times, you can still go back to questing where you left off and everything will be appropriate xp and gear for you. 
---
3) Increases the longevity of the zone or area you are in. That is, no matter what expansion comes out, or how the game changes, these zones will be appropriate for you because it scales with you. 
---
4) Zones can be more story focused. 
---
Con: 1) You never feel like you're getting stronger.
---
Let me share with you. My favorite ‘I’m gonna take it slow” circlejerk posts. I read through it at least once a week and it’s amazingly cringy
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azi98a/mindful_classic_the_way_im_gonna_play_it_whos/
---
Enjoy!
---
It's alright to admit you were wrong.
---
I like BFA too
---
For the Horde my friend! Death to the Alliance!
---
Gods can you imagine TBC, the portal and everyone in hellfire again!
---
Blizzard tried make normal raids and heroic dungeons challenging in Cata, but people just stoped playing the game and that we got what we have now.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/2053469#blog that makes pre 4.3 Cata for me &gt; WotLK
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
You're changing the argument to powershifting when powershifting is not the topic of discussion. We're talking about the Wolfshead Helm. You can Powershift without using the Wolfshead Helm.
---
You need 7 shifts for the Wolfshead Helm to give you 3 extra Shreds. Flask + 1 pot + 1 Dark Rune will give you 7 shifts while still allowing you to keep 3k mana leftover for utility spells. 
---
How much damage do those 3 Shreds do in phase 1 gear? Now compare the damage of those 3 Shreds to the overall damage to that would have been added by using a helm with stats. I would bet money that the helm with stats wins out and it's not even close.
---
DKP with fixed prices is the only worth while system.
---
But I wasn’t
---
Don't be discouraged. You're going to run into that exact thing with every mana based class. Mages have the least worry, but that's mostly because they can make their own Food/Water.
---
Poor posture
---
Well that's just, like, your opinion man.
---
~~Custon plates are super-tacky~~
---
Ok, I'm willing to accept this one exeption! Really cool :)
---
If your battle.net is NA you can stress test for 48 hours.
---
I would Love to continue this wonderfull concersation but i dont think this is the right forum for it.
---
It's okay we can just blacklist the blacklisters lol. 
---
"Don't play with that guy he has a sub optimal spec!" and
---
"Don't play with that guy hes an annoying tryhard" are two sides of the same coin.
---
None of the warlocks are going to give up the opportunity to corrupt something, even if it's better for the group.
---
Considering rolling ignites is the damage of all the mages stacking, where do they place for dps without others dps stacking on yours?
---
Orcs better in pvp, troll better in pve. if any of that matters to you
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Hes playing League...
---
Not StressTest no, but closed Beta for 2 days yes
---
Fucking healers man I swear.
---
Work is da poo poo, I feel ya brother!
---
Every one of those hurdles is a profession, or a dungeon, or a PVP battle, or making an alt. Speed levelers know to jump over that shit.
---
I think that's when they brought on some people from the terrible Diablo 3 team if I remember correctly.
---
Shit post
---
My biggest regret is not adding "[can you repeat the question?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4CVKbVtTsc)"
---
I think your exaggerating this a bit too much. I wouldn't call "holy warrior dps" a spec, let alone viable.
---
Lok’Tar Ogar!
---
MoP was so cheesey it endeared me to its humor.
---
League of legends lolololol, in 2019? It's team tactical or NOTHING!
---
Does anyone know if the stress test characters are still there or do you need to start fresh?
---
Tbh I feel like this is exaggerated. I was a MT in vanilla and I never had aggro issues.
---
I’m sure we had smart dps too, but in general on this sub people seem to exaggerate the severity of threat being an issue.
---
What's the easiest but still enjoyable class for a completely noob gf duo partner?
---
I'm thinking Pally or Priest? Maybe Pally so she doesn't die as much? I know Hunter is the go-to noob class, but it might be a bit difficult for her to manage the pet, idk... 
---
I don't really care what I'll be playing so I'm more focused on what to suggest to the gf.
---
Theres actually a kind of guy in this particular example. Lol
---
Still doesn't seem as bothersome tbh
---
&gt; endgame daily content
---
There shouldn't be any daily content.  It makes the game feel like a job.
---
Get to 60, then only log on to do specific things with your friends.  That's how WoW should be.
---
Does it take into account crit reducing cast times?
---
When they are up, they are up
---
DKs would have been so much cooler in my opinion if blizzard had stuck to their original plan and forced players to sacrifice (convert) an already leveled toon to become a DK. Seeing one would make it a lot more epic because you know a rank 50+ toon died to become that DK.
---
WotF and Tremor totem &gt; Fear Ward tbh
---
Fear ward saved one person per priest, WotF and Tremor totem saved  numerous
---
Threat generation hmmm ... I don't know how they hold up but don't forget that the tanks on horde side have windfury which increases their threat and thus increases the potential damage the DDs can do before grabbing aggro as well.
---
I don't think Alliance had such a huge edge but looking at the world first kills Alliance took a lot more bosses, where horde dominated end bosses. But by sheer number it appears you're spot on here.
---
Better than the last Stress Test? With 100+ people trying to kill the same 4-5 wolves, and a dozen running towards one when it respawned?
---
&gt;force awakens well received newcomer, yeah probably by people with no taste.
---
I'll bookmark this
---
Do they always rather play league than healing? He knows his guild needs him right?
---
So let me get this right, when eu stress testing comes around I can reserve names for the live release??
---
Don’t know if anyone mentioned this but felhunter can dispel Hunter freeze trap or whatever it’s called.
---
Don't play then - or play retail.
---
Classic is meant to be played as vanilla - not this special thing that gets additional content.
---
If they decide to add content - pit it on separate servers and allow anyone who wants to play NON classic to be able to transfer to that NON classic server.
---
Underpreciated? They were awful films for fuck sake. Just because you can make semi funny memes doesn't mean they are good films.
---
Reminds me of an old Gameboy ad.
---
Except ep 1-3 were awful
---
Crentist?
---
I am going to be Main tanking.
---
I will also kick horde butt everywhere i go
---
K
---
Private servers are literally made for this reason? Custom content, going further than the original content. 
---
Blizzard have stated in their own words that if you fell asleep playing vanilla wow and woke up in August 2019, nothing will have changed.
---
Start fresh
---
This is why people don't want to be on the same servers as streamers. Piss of a dude in a raid and you maybe get blacklisted by 40 people, but piss off a streamer and you might have a thousand mouthbreathers doing insane shit.
---
SPriest mana is probably one of the reasons everyone runs around trying to own as a warrior
---
First part of that sentence can be applied to everyone. I'm sure that at least for 50% of people their first expansion is their favorite
---
Think what u want, but terrible expansions have some great scores.
---
I really, really appreciate all this advice. Will save this comment for launch, because it's overwhelming helpful and thoughtful of you! Thank you so much! Wow classic feels kinda esoteric so any help is awesome. Thanks! Wish I could gold you.
---
Previous stress test characters were on different servers.
---
Yes you **are**.
---
You said nothing about hemo.
---
You said nothing about how they perform relative to one another.
---
You said it was mind numbing compared to combat.
---
That had nothing to do with the actual build and performance, and everything to do with personal preference.  **I** said nothing about performance.  I said combat is a pretend warrior.  Then you tried to pretend your post was about comparative performance when it wasn't.
---
You were wrong.
---
I don't mind farming the gold needed to raid at all, that's part of the game and I don't want that taken away either.
---
&gt; WoW Classic was the most causal MMO ever released at the time which is what made it so popular.
---
"Casual" for that time. It still required a huge time investment. That hasn't changed with Classic. 
---
Really at this point it's like your grandma handing you 5 cents and telling you to go buy yourself a coke. Yea, 5 cents bought you a coke at the time, but it's not going to cut it now. 
---
&gt; To a lot of people, playing a video game is just about having fun not about being the best at it.
---
Classic is not that kind of game simply because of how much time it requires of you in order to do the things you want to do. That's what I am getting at. 
---
&gt; Sure people who raid and hardcore pvp will have better gear, but you can still 5-man or casually pvp fine without top gear, or even start an alt and level up again.
---
So what you're telling me is that there's not a lot for someone to do at endgame in this context.
---
Lots of things could happen
---
- New fresh classic servers; essentially a reset button
---
- Classic Plus (new content in the classic universe)
---
- TBC servers released (WOTLK thereafter)
---
- Classic but with a form of a ladder system
---
- Absolutely nothing 
---
- Years into the future servers shut down :(
---
17 was an awkward year for many of us

---
You mean DPS in Vanilla have to manage their threat?  Next up, is water wet?
---
Seems like a solid system.
---
I was planning on possibly going arms with enough points in prot to get improved shield block, last stand and iron will. That way I can tank 5 mans and ubrs easily without having to respecc from arms. I'd be giving up enrage and piercing howl from the fury tree, but I think it's worth it for the extra survivability and stun resistance.
---
Except any decent loot council system will have loot rotation and priority lists to ensure that people who just got loot move to the bottom and people who have not received loot are high on the list for the next upgrade.  Funneling gear to one player that could quit or leave with all of the acquired items is bad practice and aside from potentially prioritizing specific gear to the main tank to help with clearing content, a decent council will look at overall benefit to the raid and try to spread items as evenly as possible.  There are obviously cases where maybe completing a 3 piece set bonus or 8 piece bonus is more beneficial to the entire raid than giving someone their first or second tier piece, but honestly a decent and fair loot council will have class leads help make decisions on loot distribution in a way that ensures that items evenly get distributed to the raid.  If you are in a guild that doesnt distribute loot evenly or fairly, get a new guild.  A good loot council system should look at the overall raid benefit over gearing any single raider every time.  One thing we even did in my past was to have weighted lists for some of the most desired items in raids so someone who was on the top of one list for an item would be on the bottom of another, and even then you are still at the mercy of the item dropping.  Loot council when done right is better in my experience than DKP because it is about putting upgrades where they make the most impact rather than to the person who hoarded the most DKP.  Having something like Neltharions Tear go to a druid or shaman because DKP would just be hurting the raid as s a whole, but DKP would allow it.
---
Maybe it was just you that was bad, terrible and not good.
---
Leveling - Good
---
Raids - Good
---
Zone design - Good
---
Amount of raids - Bad
---
Amount of scrapped content - Bad
---
Story - Convoluted
---
Obliging people to pay for a sub just to test server is another brilliant idea.
---
Here's my question. Why Alliance?! FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Right 10% threat loss means as a warrior you suddenly can't use heroic strike at all..
---
Look at you, assuming everyone here plays on private servers.
---
This is exactly what I needed to read. I've been researching a bit into classic and all I read are people going on and on about minmaxing optimal travel patterns for leveling etc. I just want to have fun. Theres no way I'm going to dedicate more than 20 hours a week to this game. Never been alliance I'm going nelf feral. Partly because I think tauren is too ugly and partly because its gonna be all new content on the alliance side.
---
If only they had a larger playerbase, like the continent of Europe or something.....
---
Just link directly to the YouTube video?
---
I think both dungeons and raids were good in terms of mechanics and design, but that was it, no real char progression etc and everything outside dungeons &amp; raids were meaningless.
---
That's correct but it's much more straight forward to make a single average weight unless there is some large situational modifier (which starfire qualifies and I had forgotten about).
---
Also I think crit is undervalued in your weights.  Did you take nature's grace into account?
---
Heroics were great until they nerfed them. I was even playing Holy / Prot pally at the time, dealt with the mana-crunch and loved it!
---
Firstly, I love this mindset and I agree with with you here, variety is fun and people are what matter!
---
That said, it has become a weird talking point that hybrids are straight up inferior or suboptimal in all facets of the game, that is simply not true it really only beings to arise in raids/late game. In most 5 mans hybrid spec DPS is on par with pure specs, they only fall behind in raids due to raid buffs, poor scaling, and poor itemization. 
---
It's actually more optimal to have a hybrid or two in a 5 man for group buffs and solid DPS, rather than having 3 DPS Rogues or something, for example.
---
Generally speaking, when I think of fun TBC heroics, I remember the Tempest Keep dungeons, or Coilfang Reservoir dungeons, etc.
---
I keep memories of the bullshit that was Shattered Halls, which was more or less impossible to tank in normal dungeon gear as a warrior, in a highly repressed corner of my memory. In fact, I remember nothing about the dungeon other than that it was a bunch of corridors, and the next set of mobs would move into position only when you killed the previous set. Oh, and Kargath Bladefist was the last boss, but he wasn't as nearly as hard as the corridor folks.
---
Yeah no WoD is super bad. Cataclysm I think is especially thought of more negatively than it should be.
---
TBH. The original 3 trilogy comparison is fine (but it kinda erases a fairly sizable number of people who quit over the course of those three, especially in Wrath, over the direction of the game).
---
Wrath was the high point for me
---
I hated WoD so much I quit for 5 years. that should be in a category of its own
---
So are you going to ignore the context if the poat as humor and me adding to that to be alao humerous or are you going to be a fan boy diva that cant handle when rhe sacred cow is insulted
---
True, idk what the hell they were thinking not including them.
---
But might be more competition for raid spots in the first place, given that so few druids are taken to raids
---
What people did in wotlk outside raids? And in WoD you got 1 item per 2 weeks, and to get it you had to clear raid at least twice, yeah, most from garrison...
---
This eu?
---
That's the server I was on.  Undead 'lock I couldn't even make it to the inn before crashing.
---
Wod was actually good in the beginning. The content wasnt the problem rather the lack of content was the issue.
---
Noticeable yes
---
Unplayable no
---
Yea cata HCs were definitely an upgrade from wotlk HCs the first couple of weeks, then came the super nerf and it suddenly was easily pugable.
---
My reply was not in the context of meme specs but in the context of people leeching by not participating in a run, as is customary in modern WoW dungeon finder where the kick protection for the first 10 minutes of the dungeon is enough for the group to finish the dungeon so they can either decide to AFK for 10 minutes to spite you or do it without you but you get to leech the rewards.
---
Leeches, scammers, ninjas and other unpleasant people have always been socially outcast in classic. Part of why the expansion was so fantastic. Everyone had a reason to behave and to try their best, because if you didn't, nobody would wanna play with you anymore.
---
Gross dude, get that crap cleaned up. Purge your car of it's blight.
---
Just curious what are you gonna play?
---
Not great for fast progress, great for everything else.
---
Combined with proactive reserves from the core it works especially well.
---
You can consider that 5mp5 is equivalent to 5 spell damage.  
---
Because the spell rank 6 cost 287 mana (talent) you will need 287sec to be able to make a new spell at 5mp5  
---
The spell base damage is 485 damage, you will be able to do one more every 4min47. (Without spell damage modifier and crit modifier).  
---
At the same time, 1 spell power would have increase the damage of all your star fires by one during these 4min47. So 287s/3s=95.7 spells = 95.7 damage (still without crit modifier which is the same in the two cases, so we do not need to take it into account).  
---
5 mp5 = 485 damage every 4min47  
---
5 dmg = 95.7\*5 = 478.3 damage on 4min47  
---
And remember that if your mp5 leaves you with not enough to cast a new spell, or for a short fight where you have enough mana, this is only dps lost.
---
And when there down there down
---
I played a few max Horde toons up through Cata.
---
Plan on going alliance, only really leveled a druid through level 40 then quit.
---
As a NE Warrior what is my best route?
---
Darnassus, Darkshore, Deadmines? Then what?
---
I'm more confused as to why the Hoover is behind the door? I'm assuming the girl has conveniently placed it there to stop animals from intruding if her wicked plans come to fruition....
---
WoD is actually pretty fun to level imo
---
It definitely is
---
Me. I played back in vanilla but at 13-14 didn’t really understand a lot of what I was doing, didn’t ding 60 until mid-late TBC despite starting the first week of vanilla. I’m gonna take my time and enjoy, but now with knowledge of what I’m supposed to be doing.
---
Karova means Cow in russian. #uselessfact
---
Pretty sure those werent really a possible thing before pservers
---
Looks like they got us at the last hurdle! I can see active realms now but when picking one, it then errors saying active game time is required! Oh well, back to the beta.
---
As you should, brother...
---
I thought there was a fairly decent bit going on in end-game.
---
Maybe in terms of the stuff in total to do maybe lacking, but the raid content itself was fairly good up until Dragon Soul.
---
The Eye of Rend, the next BiS helm after Wolfshead gives 26AP to a druid, which gives single digit increases (That's flat single digit values, not single digit % increases.)
---
Right, he tried to group them by release, except reality exists and WoD was the worst expansion to date. Worse then BFA somehow, that seems like a crazy idea, but yeah it was bad all around from the garbage no time travel issues because alternate universe or some other bullshit that doesn't effect ours. The story didn't even make for a good expansion even without the garbage paradox dodge. The Orc story was meh at best. Maybe this alternate timeline had garbage pile orcs that were easily influenced by tools called Garrosh. Either way it is the worst expansion and I hope we never see another one because I doubt it can recover from that twice.
---
They see a couple people saying that they mostly care about endgame instead of leveling and then act like that's all everybody else cares about.
---
Yea you got a point. The best way to stop blacklist abuse is probably making sure that there is a well curated blacklist available that makes sure false reports are fruitless.
---
You mean by the time everyone's progress is completely reset to 0 and everyone starts over from scratch?
---
It’s a pretty high cost spell iirc maybe it was referring to rank 1 only when oom
---
There is only one side.
---
It's not hard to imagine everything except WoD above WotLK
---
You know they made an expansion after vanilla right?  It's called The Burning Crusade...
---
I spent all of vanilla trying to be the best I could be, get into all the raids, and win every bg. It was fun and I had lots of free time to dedicate to it 
---
This time I want to really take it slow and re-discover the quests and zones that I’d mindlessly blown through the first time around.
---
So names are not reserved for live?
---
There's always the point "yeah a holy paladin would be far more useful, but this ret is your only option"
---
but I'll be the buzzkill and point out that more dps would have gotten Ony killed before the wipe too :P
---
Yeah man, just like Episode 1.  THIS IS POD RACING
---
Root+Adfree
---
Okay, I've only been playing the game since Vanilla beta.
---
But I don't understand the game.
---
Flying? Sucked.
---
Condensing the world into a tiny new continent? Sucked.
---
Attempting to balance all classes and all specs so everyone was 100% equal? Sucked.
---
Shaman on ally Pally on horde? Sucked.
---
Balancing classes around arena performance mostly? Sucked.
---
Guild bank and UI additions? Good.
---
Have to chime in to say Orc (male) Locks with decent shoulders look super bad ass imo :D
---
No not useless! My friend in this party was Russian so it was definitely intentional and definitely a fun fact
---
Oh ok, and keep max rank up otherwise? What about UD spriests with Devouring Plague? Probably an "if you have room" thing
---
Yeah. i doubt blizzard even knows what they plan to do they could throw us a curve-ball. But yes i am happy with 3 -years of classic and hopefully if they do something like that you will be able to merge servers / transfer characters.
---
Of course, every guild will have a few enchanters they max out. Tons of individuals will have it.
---
This is a silly, pointless question.
---
&gt;Master of Deception 5/5  
---
&gt;Camouflage 5/5  
---
&gt;Preparation 1/1  
---
&gt;Endurance 2/2  
---
&gt;Improved Sprint 2/2  
---
&gt;Improved SAP 3/3
---
Yeah, I run 144hz on the beta but thats the highest my monitor goes.
---
My frames are around ~200 consistently.
---
A whole lot of people stopped playing mid-cata, including me.
---
I can think of a lot of negatives in mop but I still have to say it was a good middle ground for old and current wow.
---
Oh yeah.
---
as far as im aware its 4pm PST, which is in another 45minutes
---
Streamer servers will be something else. I'll enjoy the stories and entertainment but I'll avoid them like the plague. I really hope they'll find a single streamer server per region where they all will be, so that the people who want to avoid them can easily do so by avoiding such servers.
---
That’s like a 1k mama spell, I don’t think that’s likely rotation
---
TFA was garbage. I've genuinely never been bothered by how bad TLJ was or how much of a prick Johnson was in handling it; the new movies were already screwed, all he did was spitefully piss out the fire Abrams had set to the franchise with his shitty reboot.
---
And here you've shown your true colours. It's all about getting stuff free and not helping people in need. You are a terrible person, mate.
---
Where do I download the client?
---
Oh dang ok. So not really missing out playing alliance then lol
---
Apps for websites don't exist for your convenience.  They intentionally gimp mobile sites to push their app because it lets them avoid adblockers on non-rooted phones and data mine the hell out of your device.
---
Open in firefox, request desktop site.
---
It's a lot different on pservers with the amount of consumes wbuffs minmax etc. and you didn't have the fury warriors of 1.12 before AQ.
---
No requirement just cost a little more points than the armor.
---
I had the weapons on my warrior and some of the armor on my paladin that I healed with until I got T5.
---
Receiption to TFA was mixed, but Disney marketing made it seem overwhelmingly positive.
---
TLJ was a dumpster fire, but Disney marketing made it seem mixed.
---
Disney has good marketing and lots of money.
---
This is actually one of the big problems I have with raid finder in modern WoW. You clear all the raids in 2 weeks from character creation and the rest of it is the same content with bigger numbers.
---
sign up guys, so we can have an idea of how many people are interested!
---
WoD will never be underappreciated in my book. I consider it the worst expansion by miles. I am not satisfied by BFA but still way better than WoD
---
Opening the servers when everyone is at work means less people will probably be online. Very surprising news development.
---
See you on the front page!
---
Oh sorry I misunderstood I thought you meant 6 talent points. My fault. Thanks!
---
In an mmo, usually I expect a bit more than "it's not mathematically impossible if you bring me"
---
Im not saying it's impossible, but I'm amazed you kept threat and your healer kept you up if we are talking pre 1.9
---
Hi, /u/Squatlas
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2njmg/is_this_round_of_stress_testing_for_naoceania_only/).
---
Yeah it’s just better in pvp really or short fights
---
WoD was and always will be a steaming pile of shit. It had cool story content, but lacked in nearly every other aspect needed to make it great and they abandoned it towards the end, even ruining the story by forcing some weird narrative and tying in the over-used Legion storyline.
---
Somehow Legion picked up the pieces by adding on even more over-used Legion storyline. I don't know how they pulled that off.
---
But they went right back to disappointing everyone with the next expansion. Didn't miss a beat.
---
What do you get out of week one Rag kill? Zero difference killing him week 1 or 2 months from now.
---
Leveling a warrior on a private server right now and it's not that bad. I can solo elite mobs my level and handle 2-3 mobs at once. I'm level 47.
---
Most new wow players will be told - If you wear cloth go enchanting / tailoring - so yeah there will be a lot... now will there be many with good recipes, probably not :)
---
Thank you!
---
Yea you are right. I forgot about the "spec" thing being the death of free choice considering talent choices.
---
You convinced me.
---
I’m not talking about private servers, I’m talking about on actual vanilla WoW.
---
Maybe I’m misunderstanding, are you saying threat is a big issue on private servers?
---
im aware. i was kind of talking about them adding  a new expansion post BFA on the retail game
---
Highmaul is garbage? Except Kargath that raid was amazing, Blackrock is one of the best raids in the game.
---
And weird that no one mention music in WoD, I think it was one of the best things that WoD had when in Legion it's a weak point
---
Where did I say I want things for free? 
---
I care about the transcript because I have a close friend who is hearing impaired and having a open-community transcript would genuinely help.
---
No it doesn’t, same way wep enchants like crusader doesn’t work. You technically aren’t using the wep to attack with it. It’s merely a stat Stick
---
no they don't
---
Selling enchants to your guildmates? Definitely a no.
---
I think it's a test for the future claiming of names.
---
I mean to be fair they did specify "momentarily"
---
Lol what? You want to use gold for raid gear and dkp for crafted? Hahahah
---
Why the fuck are you farming in a beta that's going to be deleted in 68 days you dumb man.
---
Agreed. And to my point, "Casual team morale"  I for instance, can certainly not make 85% of raid nights, because I have too much baggage being a dad of 2 4 year olds, and a husband to a person with severe anxiety. 
---
I dont feel like I deserve the same loot opportunities as every day warriors, but If I got passed over cause mage 1, decided that he needed a 1 hander, just in case he gets a dope off hand, while already rocking a near BIS staff, Id be pisses to not even be in the consideration.
---
No it's just stress test.
---
I'll defend Cata and say that it was not much different from MoP.
---
More parry = more parry haste = more rage for tank = more threat.
---
Of course he plays teemo
---
Yes, there is another expansion being made, but that has nothing to do with classic.
---
It's all the younger people growing up with rise tinted glasses.
---
I think this highly depends on the success of classic.
---
I see one of these options:
---
Classic does horribly. Blizz releases up through phase 6 and eventually shuts the classic serves down due to lack of subs.
---
Classic does... "okay." Blizz releases up through phase 6 and leaves classic in a perpetual state of phase 6.
---
Classic is a financial success. Blizz launches Burning Crusade and either overwrites Classic with the B.C content, or creates a new sub-world where B.C never dropped and an world where B.C is continuing on development into Wrath.
---
Some people hope they will rewrite the series after Phase 6 with new content but I doubt that. Far more likely to get B.C and Vanilla servers if it gets that far.
---
Some people are adults and have already cleared most of  the content in the past. When you'll get there you will understand. There is NO WAY you played vanilla with this bullshit.  
---
Want to make a hybrid spec work? Just try a little harder, pop consumable, go engineer. The only truth is that guilds are always looking for healers.  
---
Your going to be seriously disappointed if you think that classic is hard. It's just a bid grind fest.
---
I got the same auth. still using it, with starcraft theme though. I ordered one like 5 years ago? Maybe even earlier than that can't remember honestly. When you login and see your character naked, you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
The number could include demo accounts, china farmer spambots, etc. 30% retention for basically the tutorial zone for a fairly expensive game seems very off to me as well.
---
Where'd I say guildmates.
---
In other words, 15-year-old game is 15 years old. Great work detective
---
Actual vanilla wow is nothing like what classic will be because 1.12 changes everything.
---
Threat is something that tanks dedicate immense amounts of effort to get, you will see tanks in almost full dps gear just to maximaze threat so that the warriors can go balls to the walls, with 14% parry it might be a tad bit harder for warriros to go balls to the walls.

&lt;Progression Guild Recruitment&gt; | Horde | US West - PVP | English
---
Hello Fellow WoW Enthusiasts!
---
When Classic drops on August 27th a few friends of mine and I will be starting a progression raiding guild. We're looking for fun, serious, like minded individuals to slay dragons with!
---
A little history about us, we've been playing since WoW released in 2004, and have dabbled in both PVE and PVP over the years. With the relaunch of Classic we'll be able to progress more efficiently and effectively than the first time. Our ultimate goal is to have a high yield of boss kills, loot, and of course enjoyment!
---
If you're interested, join the guild discord. Let us know what class you'll play, experience level, and fill us in on why you'd be a good fit for the team! Thank you for your time, and please ask any questions you have!
---
**Raid Days &amp; Times:** Sun, M, &amp; Tu @ 8:00PM - 12:00AM PST (End time may vary depending on momentum.)
---
**Raid Expectations:**
---
1. Show up on time with consumables, add-ons, and appropriate specs/gear.
---
2. Have fun, Be patient, tolerant, and mature. We're in this together!
---
3. Don't be a drama llama, save it for your mamma.
---
**Raid Spots:** All classes and specializations needed with the exception of main tank.
---
**Raid Loot:** Loot Council
---
**Discord:** [**https://discord.gg/RXndkPQ**](https://discord.gg/RXndkPQ)
---
DPS questions!
---
Do rogues get to make any support-like contributions to raids? Like, could i prioritize Expose Armor as my finisher to help other Melee DPS do more damage, or use the Annihalator axe to do the same? Is Kick as an interrupt valued in raids?
---
I love that as a rogue, I could get away with keeping a PvE swords spec in open world PvP and still do decent, but my concern is that I don't think I'll enjoy PvE if all I'm doing is pressing eviscerate for Big Numbers. 
---
If I feel like I need support abilities to enjoy life as a DPS, would a Ret Paladin be a better pick? Assuming i intend to actually buff my party members and stuff.
---
No no I totally agree. The leveling in WoD was damn good. The zones were awesome!
---
But it's just like 10 hours of a 2 year long expansion.
---
I am certainly looking forward to that. I'm going to be leveling two characters, and I won't have much time to play, but I really don't care if it takes me 1 months or 6 months to reach level 60 because the game starts at level 1.
---
I am, and since I got silenced from the forum here I sit. Waiting for RP realm 16 to come back
---
Why would it be a bug if you know the stress test is today????
---
You should have looked at the other hundred posts about this before posting again.
---
The stress test is currently going on. If you are in NA you will likely be able to participate.
---
I was hoping it was obvious but yes I am subbed, to the EU servers.
---
I don't think that this is the case, since i am pretty sure the realms on launch is not going to be named "Classic Realm X".  
---
The confusion properly stems from the fact that the stress test launcher is called "World of Warcraft: Classic", and not "World of Warcraft: Classic Stress Test".
---
I was a tank all of vanilla and I never once had to go full dps gear to maximize threat.
---
I’m skeptical that you are telling me classic will be nothing like original wow when we can’t even play it or test max level content yet.
---
I don't think Google needs the YouTube app to data-mine the hell out of my Android phone.
---
I made all 3 characters on one server like an idiot, so I can't play on others even if I wanted.
---
Your dentists name, is Crentist?
---
If that 50/50 faction split holds up i will actually cream my knickers. I hate overpopulation of one faction on servers. Its almost like the other faction doesnt exist and when you finally get to pvp it up in a contested area...its very unbalanced and kills the fun.
---
It seems quitting at around the time of CATA is a pretty common theme.
---
I totally swear i read 3pm from that kavix post. Mind grabbing a source for me?
---
I'm willing to stick to mail as well, so that's a good thing to hear on that. Again being overall pretty casual I'm not too worried but good to know I have options.
---
As for crafting Sulfuras I meant crafting the Hammer primarily. I know it's more of a PvP thing but I've heard generally guilds give the Eye of Rag to a Paladin or otherwise an Arms Warrior on ally side so I figured I'd at least have a solid chance overall to get it. IS the Sulfuron Hammer hard to craft in Classic? I've only ever gotten it in retail and when I did it was more time consuming then anything cause I farmed a majority of the drops, granted with things like being way over leveled and flying and such it wasn't hard, wondering the overall difficulty of getting it in Classic.
---
The game is pretty "solved" by now, so it will be less of a problem now that we have BiS lists and we know the road to take, for example, "this shoulders droped, they are bis for the druid for 2 tiers, rogue could use them but there are some craftables on the next phase that are their BiS, lets just give the first to the druid and get the mats ready for the others"
---
That was a bit ambiguous on my part - I was talking about ret paladin
---
Unless you're joking that ret isn't even a spec, in which case I just wooshed myself
---
Weeeooweeeeoo the fun police have arrived!
---
I have a feeling that they overestimated how many people want to play, and shoved everyone onto the two servers to make it more "stressy".
---
Could you eli5 the August 13 name registration?
---
I never understood why Tauren ended up on the horde side. The only thing I can think of is proximity to the Orcs because their values seem to be opposite that of the Orcs and they more closely resemble the Night Elves'.
---
All weapon "chance on hit" require the weapon to be hitting the target, and druids in form do not use the weapon for damage as the form has it's own damage (excluding moonkin of course)
---
Try it on a Pserver.
---
&gt; Do people now appreciate the prequels or something? Since when?
---
Since the sequels.
---
The prequels are still terrible movies, but for all their (many) faults they at least feel like Star Wars films - and underneath all the bad writing and direction there's the seed of a really compelling story to be told.
---
The sequels also have terrible writing and direction but have added bad acting to the mix as well, and there's no real story to speak of, let alone a compelling one. TFA felt like a bad middle school fanfic complete with Mary Sue author-insert character and TLJ was just a straight troll job - and not even a good or clever one.
---
What do you get? Sleep deprivation.
---
You'll be able to create your characters (5 max iirc) 2 weeks before launch, August 13th
---
I did make a new character on one of the realms that is up since it is a stress test and all...but if my realm came back up I would rather go back.
---
Don't be triggered like that, it's not a personnal attack on you. Just the reality of someone who was raiding at the time and doing pvp at the time
---
For me; 
---
Classic 7,
---
BC 5,
---
WotLK 10,
---
Cata 6,
---
MoP 7,
---
WoD 2,
---
Legion 10,
---
BfA 5.
---
Stress test is NA subscription only
---
I was having the exact same issue. Have since uninstalled the stress test, and now I have zero option for Beta :(
---
&gt; but If I got passed over cause mage 1, decided that he needed a 1 hander, just in case he gets a dope off hand, while already rocking a near BIS staff, Id be pisses to not even be in the consideration.
---
To your specific example, I'm not sure in what world a mage and warrior are ever competing over the same 1H.
---
Craigolas
---
A slog with bad writing and unlikable characters... I actually like classic though
---
First off if your rolling priest you need to go wand spec shadow. Won’t be much casting going on. Dot and wand. With this spec you can also heal dngs no problem as you need. 
---
Also leveling a warrior is a living hell so I’m not sure why your looking forward to that.
---
Yes, but I'm pretty sure the 13.53% will drop a bit when they will play for hours of auto attack /crusader seal. Me I don't care, I love the class lore and to heal :)
---
Okay cool. I won't mind getting an alt to 35. The question is, do I go hunter for Aspect of the Cheetah or Mage to give out portals and water? I've read both are fairly easy to level as.
---
What's it like? Being no fun all the time?
---
I think its understandable people want to get ahead.
---
Being in a packed zone where its a throng of people fighting for every tag really isn't enjoyable.
---
lol wow, scammed yourself
---
I'm talking about how its being displayed on the launcher. Its its something their testing shouldn't it be under the in development section not the live section?
---
okay so instead of hearthing to IF just hearth to SW and log out, log in and catch DS buff if tht CD is off, then ride to DMF, grab the dps buff and drop portals to IF and fly to thorium point.
---
Nope!  I have yet to have a problem like what NoScript used to bring.
---
Yeah my whole team all play siege together and plan on playing wow together...no issues here. Have been playing games together for a while.
---
Ret paladins will certainly have a harder time, but they are still entirely viable. Obviously any other dps is more valuable, but we aren't talking about being optimal, just viable.
---
I mean I'm sure most of the people who are extremely excited about wow classic that would want to play in this test, wouldn't have an active subscription.
---
You can log launch classic client, pick out a realm and create a character to reserve names. Can’t enter the world but can set up 3 characters that will be ready to go on launch 2 weeks later
---
They want more people on the 2 servers
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
You can create the characters and reserve the names, for the characters that you want for actual classic wow release 
---
This helps blizzard determine interest for server size.
---
on our end, lets us get the names that we want, and removes one more step on release day
---
Bahahahaha
---
Yep. Especially since I'd have to do an NA sub as EU, too...
---
Personally this time i wont, i had enchanting in vanilla and it needs lots of effort and time in order to be up to date with all the enchants and build a name in your server so you can sell your stuff and make profit. Very rewarding proffession though.
---
You're not the boss of me now
---
Maybe the best post ive seen this week. Ive been toying around with a 19/21/11 true hydrid shammy spec, but been fearful of the hate id get. But now, hell, i just might give it a whirl
---
I made 3 characters on a server that is down. I was able to make another on one of the servers that was up. Unless it doesnt count if you haven't logged onto them yet
---
Lmaoo
---
I made 3 characters and those servers disappeared and I was able to make a new one on the remaining two...
---
Fkin teemo players
---
Of what lol
---
My hope is they do another round of new classic servers and release BC on the first set. I think that would be the best approach.
---
Well yeah, they specifically said that's the reason...
---
It’ll be IF because of the proximity to BRM
---
Rogue or druid?
---
I like the polish of the class, the antics and situations you can get yourself into and out of.
---
Druid:
---
Mained druid since BC. Never played vanilla druid. Like feral (dps/tanking) and resto and would probably play resto at 60. 
---
Like to do most parts of WoW- pve, pvp, wpvp, bgs, etc. a gripe would be is druid won't be fun solo wpvping.
---
I feel like most posts on here are from people who recognize that their current life situation is one where they can't go as "hardcore" as the first time around and is okay with it.
---
&gt; I played 20-35 hours a week
---
Filthy casual!
---
This stress test isn't under the beta, your battlenet needs to update and it should display Classic under the Live tab.
---
No. What a weird concept to make a post about.
---
Happened to me once during Vanilla or TBC. Definitely not fun times. 
---
I ordered one and paid for it. They never shipped it and cancelled the order because they were sold out. Never got one.
---
I have 5 characters made though, 3 on 1 and 1 on each of the ones up
---
It's just a challenge. Some people like to challenge themselves and they find enjoyment on that. There's nothing wrong with min/maxing or rushing to 60, neither with smelling the flowers while you level. At the end, what matters is to have fun, whatever path you choose.
---
Also Barman shanker.
---
Just say "if you are from NA or OCE"... he's right your sentence is confusing
---
I remember rushing the game back in the day, levelling 2 characters to max and even gearing them up and applying to guilds and what not.
---
You know what, yes. I'll just enjoy levelling.
---
Now I feel old and that's just fine.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
That plus 2pm pdt? Just an odd time.
---
You can make more than 3 characters...
---
I plan to go at a decent pace for my first character or two but after that I'm gonna use other alts to zone out on as I grind mobs
---
Makes sense, just checking. Thanks!
---
Poignant!
---
I take it this is the USA right?
---
That's just called an upvote
---
Nah, I've never been much of a Warlock player anyways. My only Warlock was boosted to 90, did the Black Harvest quest, the MoP CMs and leveled it to 110. Probably my least played class along with Shaman and DK.
---
Never been much of a pet guy. I'm just empathizing with the guys not wanting to roll them.
---
More power to you dude! The alliance needs you
---
In a 5 man if your warrior tank is decently geared and knows what they're doing, in most groups they will be #1 dps - so I' duno if beating the tank is a good benchmark.
---
I've had mine forever. I wish batteries in other devices worked this long.
---
True, but it's a dick mood to attack someone in the middle of a taming.
---
No? They didn't do the same stress test servers this time around even though it's a "stress test"
---
Anything goes with them. The only things that matter are
---
1. No more beta invites
---
2. Launch is August 26/27
---
Yes, it was in their post when they announced this that it was for US/AU only.
---
lol enjoy getting to 60 in 4 months
---
If you explain it like that, it makes sense it's easier to read, but with the sentence itself is nothing wrong. :D
---
ps. I can't change it, so unfortunate
---
So that's assuming they open up subscription service and pay to play stuff early too then?  I'm just thinking through how you'd download the client and login before you've paid for game time.  Does that make sense?
---
The amount of paladins will diminish greatly. It’s a true sluggish grind and one of the worst to level.
---
This is just fucking hilarious as fuck
---
"Ah he's so witty."
---
"Ah he plays like most of the old monks, but gosh, how has he built up so many talents?"
---
"Ah he's such an avid warrior, he got a fortune from Goldbahn and Dark Iron.
---
"Ah...why is this day so hot? Is that the sun or something?"
---
I haven't leveled either class.  So I don't know.  You could' go druid for travel form if movement speed is what you are looking at.
---
I’d choose Meatloaf.
---
Thanks so much for taking the time and going through all this.
---
I was pretty concerned about if I could even run the game as I don’t meet BFAs recommended specs.
---
I built my PC as a mid-range build back in 2014. I got 140 something for the CPU benchmark and 2550 ish for the other benchmark and when the client downloaded yesterday it put me on recommended graphics of settings 4 (I’m guessing out of 10?).
---
Happy with this outcome!
---
Yeah I’m just going to have fun and meet like minded people.  I think most of the minmax wow as a job crowd will go back to retail once the streamers start switching back.
---
Honestly you'd probably enjoy both, just play what you feel like doing at launch
---
I didn't know this but that would have been very cool, they could definitely use this is the future.
---
No. Just you. Of course
---
Based on how they described it a post yesterday it doesn't really sound continent wide anymore
---
Legion&gt;WotLC&gt;Vanilla&gt;Panderia&gt;TBC&gt;Cata&gt;WoD&gt;BfA
---
Gotcha, resubbing.
---
Whats the build on that? PCB/Case? I built my Winkeyless and had a lot of fun putting it together.
---
Yeah, I'm not resubbing for two days of beta. They'd have a lot more people if it was open.
---
Man they better have an RPPVP server. More people want to play that that RP anyway.
---
Id like to participate but having an active sub is a problem. Also its the middle of the week. Work and all
---
I had just finished my tough wolf meats in Cold Ridge :(
---
I would play on the stress server, but resubbing for $15 to only get 48 hours of play time just doesn't seem worth it to me.
---
Tofu 60% hotswap kit!
---
It's confirmed that a regular world of Warcraft subscription allows you into classic wow.
---
No flat game fee, just monthly subscription.
---
Uh... Cata was ok and mists only had pvp going for it, but wod was the biggest joke of all. I had more fun in BFA than I did in wod and BFA has literally made me quit wow until classic comes out.
---
It's part of Warcraft 3, Thrall helped them survive.
---
I think you'd get more enjoyment by optimising 1 char, dont bank on the fact that youll have two 60s because you might change your mind. Just main whatever you want first
---
And yet it happens. People can be mean, unstable, obnoxious, mentally ill etc. You name it.
---
Cata unappreciated in its time, uhhh that expansion is where the massive subscriber drop off happened.
---
Once that expansion came out, people were so happy. Mobs in heroics needed to be CC'ed. You'd actually need to communicate with your group mates. Beating the last boss of heroics actual felt meaningful. Reputations mattered again, it was unbelievable.
---
But then the final nail in the games coffin:
---
* https://cryptocurrencytalk.com/topic/60691-406-nerf-bat-to-heroic-dungeon-groups/
---
* https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_4.0.6#Dungeons_.26_Raids
---
Heroics were a joke. Raids were a joke. Questing was a joke. Justice Points were easy as hell to get. Raid logging became widespread. Dual spec was so rampant that there was no reason to make alts. The mastery stat was really dumb and nobody liked it (hence why it no longer exists).
---
I could go on but god the fact that anyone praises that expansion blows my mind. It was objectively terrible.
---
Do you plan on playing on “classic stress test server #8”? They are saving names but not on any server that matters
---
I feel ya 🥰
---
Did I do it completely wrong? I had big problems with a hunter between level 8 and 10. One respawn behind you while you're fighting and you're pretty much dead. Or are mobs much stronger on private servers?
---
Win7 but I plan to do a rebuild of my PC before Classic drops and I'll be running an as-yet-undetermined Linux Distro.
---
Wotf gives 5 sec immunity that's what I thought you meant
---
Skat Man
---
But for those that don't have the current wow or a subscription, I guess how would you start one early to be able to claim 3 character names and a server?
---
So I don’t get it. 
---
Does she need help putting on her underwear?
---
Does she want him to do laundry, because that’s her last pair?
---
I disagree with you about hybrid viability, but the rest is spot-on. Class/spec design was just about the only thing TBC did well.
---
People like different things. The fun for me is taking the optimal leveling routes, I don't really enjoy the smell-the-flowers approach. 
---
You are the opposite of me. That is also fine.
---
Yeah, same. I didn't phrase this correctly at all.
---
I was calling the people who make every raid a "Warrior" vs casual or pleab, or whatever, Not the class. but I get your confusion.
---
Actually just realized I'm wrong and apologize. You don't need sub to play, I think you might just need to have the base game because I can login my other account that has no active game time but has legion.
---
Game of thrones was garbage long before season 8 which is more like BFA lol
---
This video and post is scuffed as fuck
---
WoD was a decent single player game.
---
Go purchase a wow subscription.
---
You can play the current game up to level 110 with a basic wow subscription.
---
If you want to play the latest edition you have to buy the actual game.
---
I do not know if they will let people reserve names without a subscription. If I had to guess I would say no

&gt;WC3 campaign.  Thrall's fleet lands in Durotar and they're roaming for miles finding nothing but centaurs.  They stumble on Cairne and some Tauren fighting off centaur and Thrall jumps in to help him out.  Thrall tells Cairne about this huge centaur mob heading toward his village.  They form an alliance, save the village and then Cairne decides to take Thrall to see the Oracle.  
---
The Tauren are pretty cool with Jaina's humans (Jaina is there when Thrall and Cairne find Medivh, aka The Oracle) and the NElves too (they fight together at Hyjal), but I guess the initial meeting with Thrall left a huge impact on Cairne.  He says something like, "You greenskins fight with savagery and honor" after they save him.
---
All expacs have amazing raids. Blizzard can do no wrong there. That’s why we judge them on what they have to offer outside of raiding.
---
I really want to give enh tanking a shot in classic, but I'll probably out-level every dungeon I'm going to attempt. I got a group of friends ready to play classic with but none of them want to tank, and I don't want to switch away from shaman....
---
Priest/Paladin healer and 2 of any hunter/warlock/warrior/mage with good raid gear. Rogue/spriest is ok but definitely 2nd tier for group pvp. You really need a dedicated heal bot though - or you'll just be another 3 random pugs. The defining aspect of organised pvp compared with random pubbies is good support.
---
Battle Rez and innervate are cool to have for your grps
---
Very nice!
---
She'll probably enjoy having to feed pets etc. I would say Hunter for sure.
---
Heh, probably. I only did it once.
---
Can I ask one more question?
---
At what level does drinking and having the highest level drink start to matter? Mana regen seems a lot more lenient in the early levels and early silver matters for spells. 
---
I guess when should I start putting my silver into Ice Cold Milk lol
---
No. Everything in the beta/stress test will be deleted whenever they end the beta.
---
why? i explain in 20 secs
---
If youre min maxing go troll or orc. Engi is a must for pvp and its very good for AOE tanking
---
No, expose overrides sunset and so does annihilator. Rogues can’t use axes anyway. You will be spamming SS and keeping SnD up and eviscerating in between. Fights where you need to kick are few and far in between. You won’t really bring any utility as a rogue you’re quite a pure DPSer. Ret paladin brings utility but does terrible DPS and doesn’t really bring anything particularly useful a holy wouldn’t. The most viable support DPS is shadow priest since they bring a valuable debuff unique to the spec but their DPS sucks too
---
Probably ugly
---
I'm in the same boat. I figure while engineering is great, I would rather level with herb/alch to make life a bit easier. Then switch to engineering once I hit 60 if I really want it.
---
Plus you might be able to make some money with herb and alch, while engineering would be a bigger gold sink.
---
Yeah and it ends Friday at primetime, very strange window.
---
Warrior is almost always the highest represented class on every server at 60 so I am not at all surprised to see it where it is here.
---
Engineering is for min/maxing. 
---
My recommendation is to RP a bit and put yourself in your character. What would he pick. Don’t worry about the rest of it and just enjoy the game.
---
 engineering is great but if you pvp you will be broke AF but alchemy makes a good amount of money and you can always sell herbs you're not using
---
Me. WoW Retail is all about endgame, WoW Classic is MOSTLY about leveling. I just love it and it will take me at least until Christmas to get to 60. Smooth, slow-paced leveling while enjoying most quest chains all over Azeroth.
---
Im surprised people are on here defending Cata. Like WOD and Cata were both garbage because they focused more on changing the world in cata than the actual expansion. Panda land was decent though, had some amazing raids.
---
what a crock of shit
---
Put a ton of work into this. Enjoy.
---
For the stress test?
---
it's just a meme
---
Just like bfa.
---
I think at this point many people have played on pservers and now realize how insanely powerful Warlocks are in 1.12.
---
I also think, for the same reasons, people have realized Rogues aren't as powerful as people remembered in 1.12, so their population has gone down.
---
I'm cool with Hunter being middle of the pack, means standing out as an awesome one will be a breeze. LOVE how close the faction split is. I hope it actually ends up that way on live servers.
---

---
Random person wants to know your location.
---
You'll have a tough time progressing through current content with enhance, it's completely doable when your raid begins to outgear it though
---
I was expecting this to be a yes/no survey
---
Lol if the layering system works exactly like that - blizzard has made a huge "oopsie" and won't have enough time to change it in 68 days.
---
If you played EQ or UO wow is a joke.
---
Besides proving everyone wrong, competing for WFs, and all the attention for our recruiting efforts and streams? The simple answer is loot.
---
The guild gets ~25 pieces of loot, which will make splitting the team into two groups easier, snowballing the effect.
---
Instead of getting 25 pieces in week 2, now we have 75.
---
By the time Phase 2 rolls around, we're almost 100 pieces of gear ahead of you (if you killed in week 2 and then split), even more if we keep splitting. Now we own the world bosses.
---
By the time BWL releases, that's ~800 pieces of loot, full BIS for several players. Giving us a competitive advantage again in BWL. Our BG premades are unstoppable.
---
If we waited until 2 months to raid, that's at best half the same amount of gear and no one with BIS.
---
Fun is subjective, and for me AV matches that are several hours long where most of that time is spent with most of the players butting heads in constant attrition get dull rather quickly. Just because I don't find that enjoyable doesn't immediately mean my mindset is "don't care give gear please"
---
I was in a 4.5 hour bg over the weekend and I'll start by saying for plenty of people that's a "pfft that's not long at all" length. 
---
During this match there were a couple really enjoyable moments:
---
- Using the Ram Riders to break the stalemate at stonehearth. This took about 20 minutes since it was only myself and 1 other person gathering mats
---
- Having to contend with the ice lord when we got surprised in the field of strife with him
---
- Counter summoning Ivus to push back on lost ground. 
---
- Pulling out a win after the lines broke and it became a race to the finish, and a stalemate at Frostwolf that lasted long enough that we had to kill all the war masters twice because they respawned.
---
All told, the events above (aside from the 2nd wave of WM, idk their resoawn time) could have transpired in an hour long/ 90 minute AV. So, what's the difference you ask? Roughly 3 hours of each team banging their head into a wall getting nowhere.
---
Was victory sweeter because it came after that much longer of a struggle? Maybe. Did I really get a ton of enjoyment out of 3 hours of headbutting? 
---
This didn’t answer his question.
---
The Earthtone Coalition
---
I feel violated.
---
Herb an alch.
---
If mainly pvp mining engineering.
---
You could do Herb/engineering on War and Alchemy and and alt. 
---
You would need to buy the mats for engineering of course but you could sell the herbs and or potions you make for the money needed.
---
This allows you to have 2-3 have main professions using only 2 characters but does require a slower start up and the alt to be lv 35 for max training at least.
---
Its a No-Go,still some of them will give you a few bucks anyway
---
Yeah but I thought names were opening for August 13th, not today
---
so Does warlock + shadow priest + paladin an OK comp ? 
---
and the same for mage + rogue + paladin ?
---
Our friend also said he liked druid heal
---
All weapons are just for stats except for the manual crowd pummeler.
---
You will never cast expose armor in a dungeon or raid unless you have a Druid or paladin tank. Expose armor overwrites Sunder Armor from the warrior because it’s a stronger effect. The issue being that Sunder is the main spam ability warriors use to generate threat and when expose is on the target they don’t get the threat for from sunder. 
---
Kick is important in a few fights, not all of them, but some of the fights where it’s used is vitally important to the raids survival. Kel’Thuzad is a prime example of this. You interrupting frost bolt volley is so vital that you will have two separate kick rotations to make sure that it never goes off if one person is out of range or dies. 
---
In 5 mans your can influence the group much heavier with your control than raids. Sap, Kidney, Blind, evasion tanking and vanish pulls all can be used in 5 mans but won’t be used in raids. 
---
Btw aside from putting a buff on people, possibly a lay on hands or bop once an hour/5 minutes, a ref paladin isn’t exactly adding support to a group either. You don’t have the mana to heal while doing damage as they are a mana starved spec.
---
Who cares? Like you know when it’s going to release and you can’t play it now. 
---
Why do you guys freak out over every change on the bnet client? Especially on stress test days?
---
FC x1 (Drood)  
---
MS Bot x1 (Warrior)    
---
Support x3 (Pally/Priest)    
---
DPS x5 (Some combination of mage/lock/hunter/ele/rogue])
---
Yes including Blizzard
---
Same! I was on the RP Server because it kept me away from the trolls.

---
It was the biggest cock tease of an expansion, many good or even great ideas and they didn’t do anything with them.
---
I still have about 4 hours until I'm home from work. &gt;|
---
Fuck you
---
And not by killing your 500th wendigo in Winterspring, you're clearly not doing it right /s
---
For defense you also have PW:S, heals, and/or "defensively" melting their faces off.
---
Yeah, Ill still choose RP over PVP if push comes to shove. I like RPers personality and community related content MUCH more then wpvp.
---
The “magic” of wow left when I swapped from heals to dps in raids.
---
As a healer, if people didn’t die, and I didn’t go oom prior to the end of the fight—I was doing my job.
---
When I found dps, everything changed. My job as dps wasn’t to “do damage” it is to “do the most damage you can do”.
---
It didn’t matter that I did some damage and another spriest did more. The only thing that mattered was that I was the top spriest in the raid, top caster in raid, best dpser on server, top parse in NA region.
---
That changed everything for me. It bled into grinding reputations, leveling to max level, accruing pvp rewards...
---
Working towards being the best you can be at wow ultimately lowers the quality of the immersive mmo experience.
---
That said, I played wrath, cata and mop hardcore as a disillusioned dpser. So it didn’t ruin the game, per se. the game just shifted to being focused with endgame performance as opposed to focused on a holistic rpg experience.
---
Exactly same here. I mostly like PvP and MoP has amazing PvP and so did Wrath.
---
Did you choose a server on your second account? I was able to login but got booted for no sub when I clicked a server.
---
Wrong. You have to have a sub to get invited.
---
MoP and Legion were my favorite modern expansions. I'm convinced that every other expansion starting with WotLK has been terrible.
---
I got mine today :)
---
Yeah, a competitive guild is paying for your enchants on BIS and giving all the enchanting recipes to one person in the guild. Any sales that person makes on raid recipes should go back to the guild.
---
Yeah I hear you. That’s what I’m leaning on too since apparently it’s *so* expensive to be a warrior.
---
So everyone going around saying “rEseRVe uR nAmEs!1!!” Are just talking about the stress test?
---
Try BFA then. It’s in its own league.
---
 mining/engineering
---
How the fuck is Cataclysm a 5.6????
---
When it came out, people were pissed because it wasn't the TBC they thought was coming back after WotLK, sure. But it's a damn good expansion.
---
What if you get the gun first before any of the other gear. You don't just automatically get bis when the gun drops.
---
I would also like to know this. No one is clarifying shit.
---
The TLDR is that weapon skill barely does anything EXCEPT for raiding, where having anywhere between +5 and +8 weapon skill is a huge boost to your damage through both hit chance and glancing blow penalty reduction. 
---
If you want to get into the specifics, you have to look up like three different formulae.
---
It kind of suffered from the same lack of content outside of raiding/PvPing that WoD suffered from imo. Probably caused they retooled most of the leveling experience.
---
30 seconds in a battleground make sniping useless.
---
Ya mon
---
Don’t make her a healer just because she is new, that’s such an awful roll to force onto someone learning because the pressure of tanking or healing can be overwhelming when the group relies on you not being terrible to survive. 
---
Hunter gets a bad rap for being a noob class, but honestly warlock is what I would suggest. Strong easy leveling, simple damage rotation in PvE( shabdowbolt spam and life tap) and becomes a fucking monster in PvP later with gear. Also free mount because unless you know what to spend gold on you will not have a mount at 40.
---
Yea what a weird time. The middle of a work day? Why would they want to stress test something in the middle of the day? 
---
100% sarcasm. Come on and think. You think they should do the stress test at 6pm when everyone has went home for the day?
---
Seems to line up very well, just not labeled correctly.
---
Vanilla/New Hope =&gt; Very strong, but some flaws if you really look close
---
TBC/Emptire =&gt; Best of the series
---
WotLK/Jedi =&gt; Not as refined, targeting a new generation
---
Cata/Phantom Menace =&gt; destroyed a perfectly good universe with shitty additions
---
The rest I didn't play, but they all appeared to be shit to one degree or another.
---
Im with you man... but its obvious its because it clashes with 8.2
---
No they arent, these are still stress test/ beta servers. You can reserve names 13th of August
---
Only this is wrong.
---
Open stress test servers Wednesday in the middle of USTZ work day. 500 IQ move.
---
I will find it very amusing if the big hiccup ends up being everyone getting banned for account sharing.
---
LOL WOD UNDERAPPRECIATED GET THE FUUUUUUCK OUTTA HERE LOSER
---
Sounds like some retail loot syndrome tbqh
---
Maybe they are intentionally invalidating each tier to capitalize on a fear of missing out. You have to stay subscribed for every patch if you want to experience the non-LFR version of each raid.
---
Given how often people fuck up the simplest mechanics on live, they aren't going to be doing any better in Classic.
---
You had one job!
---
&gt;100% sarcasm. Come on and think. You think they should do the stress test at 6pm when everyone has went home for the day?
---
Yikes.
---
Buffing at GY then having to drink. SP life.
---
So, i think duel spec should be in. It should have like a 5 hour to 20 hr CD (to switch) and respec cost should stay at 200g. 
---
I know its different but the current system really punishes people who want to pvp and pve.
---
I experienced Cata as well. It's was fine at the beginning like most expansions but dropped off quick.
---
So you don’t get to keep your character names?
---
when is this active for EU?
---
i guess this is why i dont see an option for classic wow on my battle net launcher too?
---
If you want to play feral dps you should read about powershifting and decide if you want to do that
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Powershifting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_b-vtx67eU
---
It's only true, because the game is itemized like shit numbnuts.
---
If after 12 hours the account logs off for 10 seconds and reconnects from another ip address. That would be a clue.
---
It’s only cringe inducing when I tally up my /played and consider all the skills I could have developed or experienced I’ve missed out on.
---
But you know, my guild was on front page of wowprogress more than once, so I’ve got that going for me, which is nice...
---
Healing spec bandage warrior?  
---
Gotta find those +heal drops
---
&gt;there are some very angry mindsets going into this.
---
I AM NOT ANGRY,OKAY???!!!111!!one!eleven!!
---
Holy shit, yes.
---
If there was one word that always summed up WoD for me, it is "unfinished". Everything felt like a beta all the way to the end. Raids were late, only one was available at a time, there wasn't much to do, HFC took forever to come out, faction reps was just sacked...
---
WoD felt like it could've been a great expansion if it had just had the 40% of expected content that seemingly disappeared.
---
Good video, maybe put more gameplay throughout the video in the background to give something to watch while listening
---
It's worth it,  don't let anyone tell you otherwise,  end game is much emptier then you think and the content has already been done.
---
It's a time that works well for the developers so they don't have to work all night.
---
The name reserving event will happen on August 13. Beta names won’t be kept.
---
Ah good to know thanks!
---
I’m assuming they are doing it at this hour so all of their employees are working so they can monitor the results
---
Maybe memes have made people think it is good, like the prequels
---
yes. the strategy of management and absolute trash produced by blizzard's diablo 3 team (and then into WOW with mythic dungeon bullshit which is just another keystone system) sunk the company
---
Yeah, they got nerfed hard cause everyone bitched because they weren't AOE fests like WOTLK. My first Grim Batol run took at least 2 hours cause everyone wasn't geared yet, cause it was our first heroic. I heavily appreciated it, because I started in TBC and was aware of having to CC.
---
Later on, I knew it was going to be a bad run when some of the players I ran into didn't know they had a CC. (Druids with Hibernate)
---
Its heroic for a reason, it shouldn't be as easy as the normal version.
---
Hemo is decent 45+ if you want to pvp while levelling (and don't mind using sword). Before that it's tough to recommend but if you just carry a mh sword to swap to when not grouped it's probably fine really.     
---
Problem is rogue just needs so many talents to feel good. For daggers the bare minimum is remorseless/imp backstab/opportunity/camo so that's like level 35 before you don't feel terrible - and that's before you've even got malice or precision.
---
We are addicted to everything that can keep our minds off the fact we’ve still got more than 2 months to go. Surveys ftw
---
all caster mana is horrible. And 55+ water wont be available until ZQ, right?  I think its one of the reasons Rogues and warriors are so popular. 
---
I played in the AV weekender and didnt really mind, its easy enough to dis-engage and find a spot to drink in the back of the pack
---
So all this hype about reserving your names starting now is BS?
---
I seriously had a friend who didnt notice he had talents til the 50s, he was a savage in pvp too
---
People learned about Locks in 1.12. They want to feel the power.
---
Rogues do not have a ranged autoattack. You have to manually shoot each shot.
---
&gt; Besides, I doubt your way of expressing yourself at all that you maintain social contacts.
---
What a moronic observation to make, as if you can tell anything about me from 2 sentances I wrote.
---
Do you enjoy the way dwarfs look? Their casting animations and how armor fits their body? Don’t buy into dwarf priest or bust memes, play what you will enjoy looking at. Stance dancing is not difficult and any warrior who says they can’t do it needs to either learn or be removed from your raid. Like it’s literally a single macro press when an add on tells you to.
---
You don't get it, do ya?
---
They will be working late. Today, tomorrow and Friday.
---
false. you will be able to rage dump just not in the first 10 seconds of the encounter.
---
I sort of enjoyed cata, the difficulty of the dungeons when it was first released was a nice refresher. 
---
But that enjoyment ended quickly, and I cannot even begin to fathom how anyone got through MOP, literally the worst thing wow has ever done, imo. I hate everything about that content, lol. 
---
I quit shortly after cata, and came back for... bfa I think it is? I thought the legion content was badass! I was pretty butthurt I missed it. 
---
Well, the zones and the questing I thought was awesome! I don't remember the dungeons and since it wasnt current content, never did the raids.
---
Instead of downvoting why don’t you answer the question
---
Making the taunt effect a chance on hit *still* isn't worthwhile because the whole point of a taunt is that you use it specifically when you lose aggro. 
---
Just add a tanking raid set with a \~3 piece set bonus of "your Judgment taunts the target", problem solved.
---
[huh? ](https://i.imgur.com/f2qHHKG.jpg)
---
i think every time someone brings up BC and WOTLK as a similar game i will always have to disagree, because the moment the game gets re-designed in a BC and beyond approach you will lose everything that makes vanilla wow the game is gone again. I mean i won't complain, i'll have my fun and move on but still
---
For PVE:
---
Druid: Balance DPS, Feral Tank, Feral DPS
---
Hunter: Full BM or Survival
---
Mage: Fire until ZG
---
Paladin: Prot Tank and Ret DPS
---
Priest: Shadow DPS (except for one in the raid if there are more than 4 warlocks)
---
Rogue: Anything that doesn't use Swords or Daggers. Anything deep Subtlety.
---
Shaman: Elemental DPS and Enhancement DPS
---
Warlock: Anything but SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin.
---
Warrior: Arms DPS
---
Either of those two would be very good. Druid is the worst group pvp healer but i'd still take a bad healer over no healer every time.
---
Its kinda stupid to start the Stress-Test at EU Primetime ...and not let EU Players take part in it! WTF?
---
Its not the only reason but it is certainly one reason.  I got it because I played then and I loved it, still do.  Plus it's a stress test so the more players we throw at it the better I would assume.
---
Priest has atiesh as well I think
---
Lore wise undead cant be Light priests right or is it just very painful (for you) if they cast light spells?
---
I see you're a man of culture aswell .
---
This stress test is not for reserving names. That will be in August and separate from stress tests.
---
Just looking at this picture made my blood sugar rise
---
The test realms run 24/7 though so I don’t think that’s it. If they closed the realms at night I would agree.
---
Just an fyi, paladins cant hold aggro for shit in vanilla if you were wanting to tank end game
---
This used to be the case, yes. I'm unsure now if the modern lore lines up with this.
---
As it stands right now
---
Warrior -Main.
---
Mage-Alt.
---
Paladin- Bank whore.
---
ye
---
WoD is bad no matter how much time has passed
---
Hells yeah.
---
You can smell the private server elitists from mild away.
---
No give me a reason why 2pm is an odd time. Im interested on when you think the better time would be?
---
I'd remove Feral Tanking from this list and add Enhance tanking.
---
I loved Cata. First tier of raids were fun. Firelands was fun. Deathwing was pretty damn meh though.
---
Completely agree. My end game will be, eventually, completing all the 5 man dungeons. I'll likely end up in some MC and ZG pugs...just like I did in vanilla. I doubt I'll raid seriously.
---
I will, however, spend days in Alterac Valley defending it from horde scum.
---
People are definitely underestimating guild drama in these types of situations. You are dealing with 40+ people, of course some of the top contributors to the raids will at some point get tired of carrying other people if the raids aren't going smoothly.
---
Is the felhunter able to dispel a rogue's cold blood if timed perfectly ?
---
yet I cant even log on.
---
100% BS, yes.
---
Whatever you do, if you're going Priest or Shaman you will have a harder time getting groups if you refuse to heal. Yes there will be more casual groups, but look at the 'casual' players in retail at the moment with their ridiculous requirements for pug groups. They are the sort of people who will flat out refuse an enhancement shaman/shadow priest.
---
Even when you are invited to groups you will be handicapped and you will not be competitive. Those specs are not good at sustained damage. For some people it's not fun to play knowing that. Read the life at 60 thread for druid specifically, the top post is about a guy regretting being a feral druid. My guild cleared up to Huhuran in AQ40 so nothing amazing, but we had tons of feral druids in our raid group, but the key thing is that all of them had healing sets and all of them healed. I think we had at least 5 druids in most raids, my cousin was resto/balance hybrid and the others were all feral but they all healed in raids.
---
I played a Rogue in vanilla and it was HARD getting groups, even getting into the guild I was in took months and months of hard work, and Rogues were very strong in PvE. I can only imagine it being even more difficult as an enhancement shaman or shadow priest. We were alliance so I can't speak for Shamans but we had zero DPS paladins or priests, all of them healed, even if their specs were ret/shadow.
---
I think if you are absolutely against the idea of healing, even as a route to gearing your 'main' spec (e.g. getting Benediction while healing so you can use Anathema) then you might have trouble getting gear, which again will impact your performance, and over time this will also impact your ability to get into groups for harder content as it's rolled out.
---
Druid tanks are fine not a meme spec
---
People clear much harder raids on live while carrying grey-parsers. It will not be a problem in vanilla. Hell, the hardest part of a raid is getting 40 people in the first place.
---
Mining isn't neccesary to level engineering. Engineering is the cheapest crafting profession to skill up we are talking like 100-200 gold to buy the mats, and mining isn't even that amazing unless if you want to farm arcane crystals early.
---
So yeah IMO herb engi is the way to go.
---
I think I'm more interested in tanking because DPS are a dime a dozen but full level 60 warriors with tank gear are going to be in high demand.
---
Gammerita, mon!
---
I'll need roll on your plate But I can't equip it because I need that 2gold it would cost to train for my mount. 
---
Then I'll vendor the plate because I got a better one by the time I could afford to train it.
---
Why can't we in EU play by the way? The scheduled maintenance is supposed to start much later.

Made an orderly queue for Sarkoth
---
what do you think the "o" in imho means?
---
TFA did well because it was the first Star Wars movie in 10 years, and because it had the hopes and dreams of everyone who'd been disappointed by the prequels riding on it. There was absolutely no way for that movie to fail commercially.
---
That said, as anything *other* than a commercial product? Yeah, it was a fucking dumpster fire.
---
The worst part from warrior dps is that quite a bit of the bis gear is actually leather
---
My partner is looking to play (never played before). Was thinking Hunter, Mage or Warlock. I know mages can AOE. But hunters can solo tougher elites and dungeon bosses right? And easier to play? Would that be her best choice.
---
Bonus question, I was going to pay for her to play (either a new bnet account or another wow account on my bnet)... if she gets bored is there a way I can merge the characters onto the same account?
---
I havnt played in years so if the above is against TOS please feel free to warn me.
---
I'm with you.  It's so obviously a cringey fan service scene and doesn't benefit the character at all.  It only exists so fans will cum their pants, stamp their feet and holler WOW SOO COOL.  And I hate it, please just write better stories for your SW films.
---
You need to be from NA. EU don't get to participate in this stress test.

No one on this subreddit ever takes a screenshot.
---
What's a 15 man raid?
---
whaaat, WoTLK should at least be 8, it was really fun
---
If I tried to do that I would most likely ding by discovering redridge or something.
---
The prequels still aren't appreciated lol.
---
Also, BFA is not controversial, its been generally considered bad.
---
What did Paladins and Warlocks ever do to you?
---
To stress the servers properly, players should spawn @ lv30, alliance at Southshore and horde at Tarren Mill
---
It's a test, for one. For two they should give loyalty priority? I get BFA isn't the greatest but if it means that much suck it up and sub.
---
It's not really that bad after you get to like 30.
---
Any poggers? Or truers?
---
Completely agree, some bullshit EA tactics here
---
Generally companies would schedule employees to come in on off hours for special circumstances like this since a stress test literally relies on fitting as many people as they can into the servers and monitoring / tweaking. 
---
And obviously more people are able to play outside of normal work hours/weekdays
---
Just would have been a big brain move to do it that way than to run into the we don’t have enough people on problem
---
No shit. Blizzard has no clue what they're doing and they still haven't fixed layering or any of the gamebreaking bugs. 
---
I swear i have seen this happening once before, and not long ago.
---
I played on an rp-pvp server on a paladin. My first time I went into VC, our group leader and warrior tank wore a robe and had a 2hander sword because he was rp'ing a paladin. We cleared the dungeon anyway and I cant wait to experience this again.
---
In a 40man, literally 200 dps isnt a life or death for your raid. I cant think of any fight, minus vael (and even thats a stretch for back then when raids had 9 hunters), where the amount of damage you are dealing factually makes a difference compared to the other 20-25 dps in your raid. 
---
Have fun. If crunching dps is fun, cool. If ele sham is your dig, cool. You'll all pay for a GDKP carry anyway, pro or otherwise. /s?
---
Cause there are enough people who subscribe that want to test. That don't need to find non subscribers to test the game.
---
yeah if you're a bear druid be ready to farm Gnomer for pummelers
---
I spammed HS as a fury warrior back in 1.12 all the time and never pulled aggro while topping DPS meters, stop making grand declarative statements over nothing.
---
It's a money grab pure and simple.
---
Retribution, Protection (Paladin), Enhancement, Elemental, Balance, Feral (to an extent

Basically if you're a hybrid, prepare to heal.

It's a reaction to the period before they when this sub was 95% about min-maxing etc.

It'll either normalize or bounce back, as it always does.

Like holy fuck... stfu. It's this never ending circle jerk by middle aged neckbeards who played when they were just sprouting and never understood raiding at all. We get it. You want to quest and not be hardcore. Cool. Awesome. Thanks for sharing. Now put some deodorant on and fuck off back to the basement.
---
Too many people with no sense of irony were exposed to /r/prequelmemes
---
a few
---
Only because half of them are shit, and don't want to tank.
---
I hope all the RP-PvPers are prepared to claim one of the PvP servers as unofficially RP.
---
Someone told me they were just testing live servers for release
---
My only guess is to reduce toxicity and potential trolls to the community.  People with paid subscriptions have more to lose than those who don’t play the game.
---
I’ve heard EU is free and that may be due to the volume they need to test is not met so they opened up that restriction to get more people.
---
AFAIK expose armour takes up a sunder armour (warrior) debuff slot in raids so isnt needed as much. 
---
Rogues aren't really a support class more pure dps, paLADin is probably going to be more rewarding if support is your thing
---
I don't think this sub is that way, it just has a lot of members so you will see posts from the hardcore players just as much as you do from everyone else.
---
&gt; the reason it's a bad movie though is because it took all the plot points of TFA and threw them in the trash.
---
And why shouldn't it? TFA was garbage. Instead of continuing the story of the original trilogy like it should have, instead Abrams and Kennedy decided to take a massive, steaming shit all over its legacy even as they shamelessly ripped it off.
---
I've genuinely never been upset about how bad TLJ was or how much of a prick Johnson was in handling the film and the response to it. All he was doing was spitefully pissing out the fire Abrams had already set to the franchise.
---
No. Not going to be able to relax until I'm 60 in BiS gear with all content on farm. Then I can start having fun.

The force awakens was awful. Not as bad as TLJ but literally just a rehash of a new hope with female and black leads

Why does it hurt so much for Blizzard to slap the RP tag to a PvP realm.
---
That would be a terrible idea, especially if just anyone can add to said third part DB.
---
So some guy shows up ret for one run, someone gets butthurt after a wipe and blames the memespec guy, slaps him on a blacklist even though the guy normally plays holy, but wanted to fuck around as ret one night.
---
Seems kinda senseless and abusive.
---
Feral tanks are not a meme spec.... they are actually best in slot for a few raid bosses because of their massive threat generation.
---
Also really good tanks for speed running through raids bc of threat generation.
---
&gt; macro your Bloodthirst with the MS icon and you won't notice a difference
---
pro strats
---
Druid tanks are used when the Main Tank has to take a piss between bosses, that's it.
---
I have fond memories of my raid leader exclaiming: "Who the FUCK is using lobotomizer?"
---
Hahahahahhaahahhahahahahahahahqhqhqhahahahahahahahahahaha
---
People were able to name claim about half an hour before the stress test started. That's what they're talking about
---
Crizzt.
---
Paladin's literally just spam Flash of Light as fast as possible. Doesn't get easier than that. 
---
Priests would probably be the hardest one imo; they have more options for healing and thus more thought has to go into it.
---
Shamans are pretty easy for the most part. Just remember to put your totems down and cast Chain Heal a lot.
---
I don't think you remember the vanilla experience very well... It was more like guilds searching for literally anyone they could stuff into the raid to reach 40 because only 30 people were online that night.
---
A fury warrior will out-threat a druid every single time. No one uses a feral tank in speedruns.
---
They think it'll have a low pop, despite the request thread for a RP-PvP realm being HUGE.
---
They just trying to get by until November when nobody cares about layering =/
---
How about the weekend?
---
Well, i'm really considering coming back to play, i never had the chance to play wow vanilla.    I came on at BC,  and haven't played in probably 4-5 years, so my knowledge is spotty.    
---
Originally i was a hunter
---
Followed by priest and a druid.
---
I've played warrior and i seem to have a good time playing most characters, except shamans, i have never played one.
---
I usually prefer alliance.    Wanted to know if people can make some suggestions on fun classes.    I feel i will be solo for a while at least, grinding my way up in rank, but probably then look for a nice levelling guild to join.    From what i gather, tanks are going to be hard to play solo and pve, i enjoy being a healer and having people covered.   I also love dps.    
---
I think im leaning towards a ranged DPS, what are everyones thoughts on priest, or hunter, possibly mage.
---
I suppose mage has alot of utility to support other characters once they level up.
---
Im not a fan of the suck it up argument, its just affirming its a dirty move. But the loyalty argument I can get behind; however, what if I subbed for 3 years in TBC/classic and some other dude subed last month just for beta (never a sub before); then should I be they more loyal patron?
---
For sure, crowd pummeler farming is not something the average player is gonna want to do.
---
Yo any advice for 49-52? 
---
I plan to play mage and will aoe grind Mara a bit during this time but tbh I don't enjoy aoe grinding all day long and I've noticed a slight lack of questing for 49-52 on alli.
---
After that it feels u can do ungoro, felwood, maybe even start on Western plaguelands etc .. 
---
Am I missing a zone for 49-52 ? I did all of searing gorge that I could do alone.
---
Keep up the hard work gunna check your twitch out for sure
---
 heck yea brother
---
Does anyone know is this test pretty much done? Or are they gonna bring the other servers back up?
---
The genie is out of the bottle to a certain extent and I levelled so many alts through the pre-Cataclysm old world that nothing will really be new..... But I'm going to stop and smell the roses anyway and make sure my professions are kept up to speed throughout the whole process.
---
I'm sure there'll be plenty like me who I can group up with on the way to 60.
---
Thank fuck I have a bf with an active sub I can mooch off of. Work also prevents me from being able to play, so dropping 15 bucks for at most a few hours of play would have been stupid.
---
Dr Jan Itor!
---
&gt; Cats and mop definitely under appreciated for their time,
---
Cata? Really? Going from WOTLK to Cata sucked a lot
---
Adults have disposable income. Adults make better testers. Enough said.
---
Perhaps I wasn't clear enough there. My problem was with the binary all-on/all-off nature of Brave's built-in script blocker. I've never had any trouble with NoScript; it works exactly as I think a script blocker should.
---
Hell yeah!
---
I played Vanilla through the end of Cata. Quit afterwards.
---
Me, and two friends who played back in the day, will be returning to play Classic only.
---
I wouldnt touch Retail with a ten foot pole.
---
Skarm tanked AQ and naxx as feral. So much for a meme spec.
---
considering the realms were not full enough to stress them properly they should do a test and let anyone on to really stress. 
---
also should do it at a better time when most ppl arent at work
---
Windfury *
---
It was the expansion I joined into and I must say it was an epic experience for me. Probably one of my favourite times gaming. But even I realised it was actually pretty flat at times. I loved the start of Cata. But the endless grind of soon obsolete gear bored me into quitting.
---
Lol wow I was wrong again. Yeah you need sub
---
I enjoyed all the Star Wars films. Yeah some little moments but in summary they're all great films.
---
Are you me ?
---
lol im sure thats the reason
---
Sounds fuckin awesome. 6 irl days of the journey through Azeroth. Kind of like marathoning LOTR and stuff. Going through the entire world in a week will be really immersive not to mention the boysssss
---
Feral tank is definitely not a memespec, we've spent years on private servers disproving that myth.
---
Don’t party up, just wait in a single file line and make it last 15 minutes longer than it should!
---
They did say “The servers aren’t stressed enough. We will be shutting down realms momentarily to stress our remaining servers more” before that countdown.
---
I assume they will probably reopen some of the other servers as more PST people get home and come online.
---
Yup I'm wrong my bad didn't try actually pressing a server because I had no interest in playing on that account was just checking. Didn't think I'd be allowed to make it that far lol
---
Mines got a Corehound on it, don't remember when I got it but its batteries are almost dead now D:
---
Well that's kinda his whole point.. in vanilla there was a time with no battle groups, then they added battle groups.. hes asking for the same thing to make it as close to possible as the original experience
---
I never played shaman in vanilla, but I am going to this time around. Can you herb while in ghost wolf?
---
I still have mine. Use it for my whole blizzard account. Actually got it in America and kept it when I moved to the UK and it never depaired from my account when I made my account an EU account.
---
I would definitely start as herbalism alchemy. 
---
The bottom line is that the money to go from 1-150 profession is just tiny. I don't feel that while leveling, engineering gives you much value. It's got pvp grenades, but it's something you have to actively use. It also takes up significant bag space, in my limited experience. And I really don't like thinking of professions as "your professions". I think of them as "your leveling professions", which you replace some or all of later with "your endgame professions". 
---
Sure, engineering is great to swap to when you get serious about pvp, and might be worth having for world pvp while leveling. 
---
But potions are also incredibly important for pvp, and if you are leveling, you kind of have to, to my mind, expect to be a bit broke. It's not in my opinion, practical to have a full set of elixirs and potions off the auction house while leveling (and I don't even know if they will be present: it can be pretty hard to even find a lot of leveling elixirs on the AH of a mature server).
---
As a result, I feel that while engineering may actually provide more value in world pvp ( I am far from a pvp expert), I feel that alchemy is far more practical to CAPTURE value while pvping.
---
And in terms of your early dungeons, It will be VASTLY more useful to your success to hand your healer a stack of mana potions and an elixir of wisdom, and have a full stack of elixirs up on you and basically unlimited health potions. Which is what my experience of alchemy has been on private servers. Assuming that the nodes aren't hopelessly contested (which will also be a problem for engineering), I think it will be the same on live. 
---
One thing I would note: if you do go alchemy, here are a few tips I picked up as a human warrior.
---
You want to immediately craft as many healing potions as you can with your initial herbs to skill up without wasting the important buff herb, earthroot. Earthroot will be the herb you want to carry a full stack of while leveling, to get the valuable early game buffs. 
---
Just drink most of the health potions on cooldown for regen. It's not worth mailing them or vendoring them, use them as a bandage substitute so you can vendor more cloth at the start of the game. (you will get more linen than you need to level first aid anyways). 
---
 Make no more elixirs than you can drink at a time, for any reason, or that you can give to a person at a time. Your goal as a leveling alchemist is to try and get as high as you can in alchemy skill before you start running low on earthroot and need to conserve it to make buff elixirs, and before you start making lesser health potions, because they are by miles the least useful thing you can do with briarthorn. 
---
Mail your mageroyal to a bank alt, as you cannot make anything you will ever want to use with it, and it's primarily good for replacing briarthorn while leveling, so it should be saved for that purpose, along with stranglekelp. 
---
A very powerful early game strength of alchemy is that you can 4 man dungeons easily by just buffing the hell out of your healer using mageroyal: an elixir of wisdom and a stack of lesser healing potions are a LOT of power to give your healer, which keeps you up and keeps you from losing your 1 hour buff stack.
---
&gt; That's a pretty weak argument. 
---
Saying "That's a weak argument" doesn't make it true. I'll catch you up with what I posted in case I missed you. 
---
Druids have all the tools to tank at level 10. They get a taunt, they get a single target ability, and an AoE ability (Demoralizing Roar). Yes, it does produce threat and they get Swipe at level 16. 
---
Warriors have all the tools to tank at level 10. They get a taunt, they get their single target ability (plus others that increase threat like Revenge), and they get an AoE ability (Thunder Clap). 
---
Paladins have ***no tools*** for tanking at level 10. They never get a Taunt, ever. They only have access to one AoE ability and it is 11 points into Holy. ***No other tanking class has this problem.*** Period. 
---
The original post that the poster made was, "I honestly think as long as you bring something to the table, either shaman totems or paladin blessings or druid innervate, then bring your best man."
---
To which I said, "That was the goal with Vanilla, but the game literally was not designed to make that feasible."
---
Prot Paladin is my example. The game was literally ***not designed*** to make Prot paladin a good tank compared to others. It's almost as if Blizzard just forgot to make them viable. 
---
&gt; 11 holy isn't a big investment (and early it was 21 ret), it's not like, you have to spec completely different.
---
If you are a new player, and want to tank because you have experience playing WoW in MoP, or Legion, you wouldn't know or assume that you'd have to go into holy to make it even viable. You probably wouldn't even know that you ***don't*** get a taunt. That's a problem.
---
&gt; On top of that, consecration is MUCH better than any druid or warrior aoe ability, when it comes to tanking.
---
It totally isn't. Not only do you have to spec 11pts just to get it, it means that you can't really tank properly until level 20. That means you're going to have a really tough and aggravating time doing Deadmines, which I have done on my paladin. It was pretty frustrating. 
---
It's also very mana heavy, so you'll only get like 7-8 before you go oom. It's not like you're really spending mana on anything else anyway. 
---
&gt; The lack of taunt is a fair point
---
It's a deal breaker. It means that the rest of the party has to work twice as hard to make it work compared to other tanks who don't have that problem. 
---
&gt; rail on prot paladin talents, do so on redoubt and reckoning, which require to get crit to trigger, which is something a tank usually wants to avoid.
---
Well not only do they typically want to avoid that, but it's a reactive ability rather than proactive. Not very useful...
---
&gt; If you get on retail right now, do you feel there are any differences between the classes? any particular strengths or weaknesses?
---
I see this question often, and it's a clear indication that most players are not looking further than the fact that "Class X, Y and Z both do A and therefore the same!" 
---
Druids, for example, have gameplay that focuses around lots of hots. They always have. 
---
Paladins, back in the day, focused on big mana efficient heals and main tank healing typically. Then in later expansions they got extra abilities to help raid heal. A lot of it is still single target focus, so Beacon of Light is an example of that. 
---
Shaman have a lot of raid heals, and kind of what they are known for. Chain heal is still one of the best group heals in the game because of its "smart" targeting. Totems are also useful and act as a weird kind of "dot" but is stationary and does it's own thing. Their single target heals were rather weak, so they got buffs in later expansions to help with this. Riptide and Earthshield being examples. 
---
How about dps? 
---
Rogues have to manage an energy and combo point system, as well as appropriate use of cooldowns to do their job.
---
Warlocks have a variety of specs that change how you play. Demonology focuses on, you guessed it, demons. The goal is to build up an army of demons, then buff them during the fight at just the right time to get the most out of them. It's actually a pretty fun spec! 
---
Ret paladin is kind of like a rogue because you have combo points, but your abilities are cooldown based and come off CD based on procs. So proper execution of your rotation is important. Retail gives them a chance to ***actually*** be good hybrids. Not only do you do comparable damage to other "pure" classes (something that classic does not have), you also bring utility to the raid in the form of blessings (only Blessing of Wisdom and Blessing of Kings to cast and can only be on 2 targets), and of course your abilities like Blessing of Freedom and Lay on Hands. 
---
None of the classes are "the same". They all have their own play style and features that make them unique. The only thing that makes them similar is the role they are in. 
---
&gt; So? The hardcore guilds minmaxed just as heavily back then and despite classes being much more homogenous now, we've never seen raid compositions like this, where nearly all dds are one spec. At least, I've never seen a vanilla raid, which brought the equivalent of 18 dps warriors or mages to a first kill.
---
Well Vanilla certainly wasn't as competitive as it is now. You're also seriously downplaying the fact that ***top*** guilds these days are doing ***crazy*** strats for a couple of bosses in order to get that 1% edge on the fight. I don't know how else to explain it to you. These guys are doing strats that would not work for normal mythic raiding guilds. They are doing things at a different level. You have College and Professional Football players. They are both playing the same exact game, but the Professional players are just better. It's like that. 
---
But we don't have to speculate! Check out Method's kills. 
---
https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/tarren-mill/Method
---
Click the raid tier you want, then the raid, and then click the + to see what their comp was. 
---
The Kil'Jaeden one proves my point. The first kill is super optimized for soaking. That fight was actually pretty shitty because it favored classes that could soak the "bombs". 
---
Note though their "fastest kill" and it's much more spread.
---
&gt; An 8th mage or warrior, you cannot gear, because need their stuff. A hybrid dps class will get the gear though and keep up with an undergeared pure dps class.
---
This doesn't even make sense. I mean if your argument is that "We can't give that 8th mage gear because we don't have enough to go around!" then how does that help when you bring a different class, like a boomkin? You've defeated your own argument. 
---
If you take a feral druid, he would be taking gear that would be better suited to a rogue or warrior. Period. If you take a shadow priest, he will be taking gear that is better suited for a mage or warlock. Period. From a dps perspective, there's really no reason to give loot to a class that cannot use it as efficiently as a pure dps class. That's just how the game was designed. 
---
&gt; It's also completely false, that those specs don't bring anything for the raid.
---
Well not that they don't typically bring ***anything***, it's just that it's usually already covered by that class but in a different spec, or doesn't make up for their short comings. 
---
&gt; A druid brings another battlerezz and innervate as well as a 3% crit aura.
---
Battlerez sure, but you'll likely already have 2-3 druids as resto in the raid anyway. If you're fucking up that much in a 40man something is up. Innervate, sure, but again, you still have those other healing druids in your group more than likely. 3% crit is only to the group that the druid is in and he would have to be doing more damage than a potential extra rogue or warrior would provide, which I am pretty sure won't be the case. Secondly, even if it was a viable position, he'd likely be the only druid that they would take like that. "Sorry other feral druid, you literally have no place in our raid. We have our token feral." 
---
&gt; A shadow priest brings a shadow dmg buff. 
---
I don't recall if dots are stackable in Vanilla. I know there is a dot limit for bosses although not sure what it is for Classic launch.
---
&gt; A ret paladin brings judgment of wisdom/light (can be technically done by holy, but is a hassle for them),
---
It's not really too much of a hassle to be honest. 
---
&gt; I don't think many guilds will bring 5 holy paladins to handle all the blessings themselves.
---
Most will have at least three. So that's Wisdom, Kings, and Might which are the three most important ones. 
---
Basically put, whatever role that a hybrid could get in Vanilla is going to be a token spot that will typically be covered by other classes in different specs (usually healing) because Vanilla was not a complete game as far as hybrids were concerned. 
---
If your goal is to play a hybrid and "have fun", you should know exactly what you're getting in to. Vanilla is not like retail where you bring the player and not the class. If the raid is "full" on Ferals (1-2 in the raid), taking that third ***will be a dps loss***. 
---
That's just how it was made.
---
If only there was some other continent not at work right now, which could stress the servers during US work hours.
---
I enjoyed ALL of classic.  But my memories are also still there.  So the "go explore and discover stuff" is a bit less appealing because it'll just be the same thing I discovered before.
---
I'm not crazy hardcore leveling but I'm also not just wandering around the mountains wondering what's on the other side either.  (Spoiler It's dustwallow marsh and it's really cool the first time you see it but I probably won't even go there till Onyxia this time).
---
Don't get me wrong I'm going to enjoy the world.  But I don't have the wanderlust I did before.  Because I explored the HECK out of the game.  Going many places I wasn't supposed to be able to.  Finding so many remnants of unfinished zones (hyjal) or just random unexplained NPCs (Magaskar in Durotar does nothing, he's a remnant from the beta, a quest npc that no longer has a quest tied to him), or the house extremely west of menethil harbor if you hug the mountains while swimming in fatigure water... Go far enough and you can die to port from Menethil to Westfall.  It takes a while so it's a shortcut that's pretty long lol.
---
Anyways I enjoyed all that a lot.  But there's going to be less to find this time around.  Maybe I'll think of some places I had never ventured before but it'll be few and far between.
---
I plan on maining a orc warlock and want engineering eventually for PvP. But is there a better route to go while leveling as far as professions. 
---
Also I plan on having a warrior and shaman alt. And eventually would like to have alchemy/enchanting at max across my characters
---
&gt; I wouldn't say introduced; Vanilla had a lot of those as well. For every Sunken Temple or BRD, there was a Stockade or a Scarlet Monastery.
---
It introduced it as the _standard_ though.  Some of vanilla's dungeons were hallway-esque, but _all_ of TBC's dungeons followed the exact same pattern.
---
&gt; Which was mostly good. Having pvp gear be better for pvp and pve gear better for pve is a good design.
---
I disagree.  It pigeonholed players into being "PvP'ers" or "PvE'ers".
---
&gt; Which is also good. Badges and Heroics are deeply tied together, and both of them provide genuinely challenging content to people who prefer small groups over big raids.
---
I completely disagree.  Badges are a very inorganic way of getting gear.
---
Obviously I'm not going to convince you of anything, so we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---

---
lmao @ all of the "I am going warlock because easy gearing! there are so few warlocks I will get all the epics!"
---
Most casters, especially priests, will pick up tailoring/enchanting to rush getting a wand. That’s what I’m gonna do. Enchanting sucks ass to level though
---
Priest is very easy to level, it's decently quick. You Mind Blast, PW:S, SW:P and then use wand to finish. Due to Spirit Tap talent, you end every fight with full health and full mana. You can also fear and run away if you accidentally pull lots of mobs.
---
Shaman is a bit slower. Pre-buff Lightning Shield, Flame Shock drop a Searing Totem (and Strength of Earth if you're going to pull more than one mob in this area) and then just auto-attack the mob to death. Refresh Lightning Shield, heal up and repeat.
---
Between the two I am finding Shaman much more fun to level though. Ghost wolf is so useful, and you have such a huge toolbox of different abilities to use in different situations. Dropping a quick Stoneclaw Totem so you can Ghost Wolf and run away, kiting with Earthbind Totem to reduce mob uptime on you is really cool and engaging.
---
Dude there is report feature in this application, if you do not like something you are free to use it. I just want more laugh and less hate in this subredit.
---
my least favorite expension pared with my favorite star wars movie. (wod and revenge if the sith)
---
Up until maybe vael (and in better players’ cases beyond) most of the raid’s specs barely matter.  Do you have healers and tanks?  Are the dps doing damage?  When I was first raiding MC we were very much a friends and family guild to get the 40 people, and we cleared mc and eventually bwl before not raiding as much.  There were hemo rogues and shadowpriests and balance druids etc.  you really only need about 15-20 decent players to carry the other 20 in MC.  It just so happens a lot of less desirable specs are of the dps variety so having a handfull of really good dps who are actively being geared can carry  a solid amount.
---
You asked for a valid reason, I gave you one.
---
To be fair, it was in Vanilla, later in the spectrum of the game, and it wasn't positively received by many.
---
Don't forget to either save the layouts/profiles you make within the add-on UI if it's an option and/or change the folder names to the character you snag on Classic launch.  
---
This is exactly what I'm going to do. got slammed in the face with nostalgia as I kept finding add-ons I used years ago as Classic compatible add-ons. I just need to find a good countdown timer and scrolling combat text mod and I'll be golden.
---
You could say that about every film ever.

&gt;Copyright laws a joke and doesn't deserve to be enforced

So no one deserves to protect their intellectual property? In other words, everything should just be free?

You care about your friend, I get it. But making a transcript against Josh's wishes, of HIS work, is not the way to go about it. He even suggested that your friend and people in a similar situation take contact to him. Or you could link your friend the podcast, and he/she could get it transcribed professionally. So that everyone who puts work into their business, gets PAID just like other people do.
---
It really isnt hard to understand.
---
It's not as bad as people make it to be, especially when you combine devouring plague with inner focus. Other mana classes go oom as fast as spriests, or even faster (shaman, fire mages, shapeshifting druids). Go to any instant 60 private server and try it out yourself. You probably won't use more then 30%-40% mana to win a duel
---
Cross realm bgs are cancer for classic anyone that says otherwise never played classic or p servers.  If you lose the single server community it's over.
---
I was on Crushridge. I know one of my characters was named Mwah and I was in Doom Smash Kill.
---
I love this post down to (and especially) the last sentence!
---
I gave it a go but I'm just... Not a fan of how *rushed* everything feels now. There's just too much to do and too little time to do it in and every interaction with another player feels like you're just joining them in a race to the finish line of the dungeon/bg/quest/etc.
---
I think I'm just old now.
---
Legion well received LOOOOL  
---
Maybe by drooling imbeciles that are the new target audience it is well received, but Legion was the worst expansion of all time. I will never forgive Blizzard for their approach to class design starting in Legion.
---
No. Enchanting will be sorta rare compared to the other professions.
---
Are you in eu? it comes out on 26th in na
---
Struggling between mage and warr.
---
Warr I love all specs n roles.
---
Mage I love in pvp.
---
Main focus is pvp. But then that leads to premades... Where warriors are incredibly fun.. But mages are more fun solo, which I imagine I will be a fair amount via lvling and farming.
---
Mages faster leveling and generate gold faster.
---
Game is like 90% pve.. So makes warr idea more appealing.
---
I realistically only have time for one character.
---
They could have made the vanilla zones go 1-80.
---
did someone say thunderfury blessed blade of the wind seeker?
---
You also seem to be forgetting the 2% crit that helm also gives. Cherry picking stats doesn't help you get the right answer. It just makes you look like you're desperately trying to win an argument on the internet.
---
Fishing pole killing Elites as a rogue?
---
You can heal 20/0/31 or 21/0/30, just not as well as as the build posted above, especially at low gear levels. You'll have to see if it is enough for 5/10 man's. Should be ok for raids.
---
I will on my first toon. I'm sure I'll do some kind of addon like azeroth auto pilot with my alts.
---
No. The stress test is open for anyone with an active subscription.
---
The stress test is not the beta, its limited in both in game content as well as being a timed event with a clear end date.
---
Yep , Texas

Guess not
---
Haha, I would not be able to fall asleep after raiding cause I would see those lines vibrating when I shit my eyes. CRT monitors.. I was starting to forget how it felt after staring at them all day.
---
Thank you for this - very reassuring and rekindled my desire to roll Rogue for classic! I definitely have some learning and adjusting to do, coming from WOTLK/Cata sub dagger gameplay, but I think it will be a fun experience.
---
You still here? Dont you have some world quests to do?
---
It’s not available until after BWL is released.
---
I enjoyed Cata as an expansion. I didn't really like Dragonsoul or LFR when it was added and also CRZ... Blah!
---
I think the first good non-cash grab reason
---
Warriors have no threat reduction or threat dump, so it's a huge issue on horde.
---
Warlock if you prefer to solo content
---
Engineering is beneficial but by no means a "must have"
---
It won't be available Phase 1.
---
Progressive itemization.
---
I was on Crushridge up until the end of BC (I quit right before wrath). I was a hunter called.... Hedhunter.
---
Thunderfury isn't available until Phase 3 and then it's BIS for the entire game.
---
with mage + rogue you probably want some heal and friendly dispell, so priest or pala. 
---
Wiht warlock + shadowpriest you got big dispells already, could use heals but could also do fine without.. You have no utility for a warrior to play, so maybe something like hunter or rogue to kite and wait down dots.
---
I kinda get it. It wouldn’t be a ‘true’ stress test. Everyone and their family could login just for the 48 hour test, even if they don’t plan to on release.
---
Yes, the curseforge site let's you search for classic specific add-ons and will recognize them once they're in your add-on folder. It didn't like actually using the app to install the add-ons from clicking install on the site for me last night, but if I can update them in the app? Whatever.
---
The ones off the beaten path are awesome.
---
Important to note that Rogue leveling is definitely not easy. They're not quite as bad as Warriors but they are nearly there. No self heals, lower armour, just as gear reliant. The only big positive is stealth, but instead of stealthing past mobs you should be killing them for XP anyway.
---
Its not valid though. this test isnt for those ppl that report bugs with due diligence, its a stress test, operative word is stress
---
it seems i got beta now, not a subscriber, but day1 player tho
---
You should try https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/
---
People are mostly talking about what they themselves enjoy, most people on the sub probably don't care how anyone else is going to play outside of their own guild. Personally I've never really enjoyed leveling, but I'm not a speed leveler either. (Being a speed leveler would require me to practice leveling)

100% mana and farming a shard seems better than 50% mana?
---
You rank 1 shadow word pain 4 times (5 times if you're not allowed the debuff slot) followed by max rank as it's the quickest and most efficient way to stack shadow weaving to 5.

Its a she?

Guild sounds vaguely familiar... I'm sure I saw you guys running around at some point, the server was do small!

I hope you saw a doctor

I once saw a warrior named Threemages
---
Fucking moonfired his ass lolol
---
You can take those points however you'd like I guess, but my point is that TBC was NOT just vanilla++ whose only mistake was adding flying.  I didn't even bother adding the more subjective stuff that I _personally_ hated, like the smaller raid size.  To me, they're not even the same game.
---
Female Dwarf Priest is the hero you need to be.

Blizzard wants everyone to report on their stress test experience with an extensive survey. And of course they're always looking for bugs.
---
I can't wait. Not sure who downvoted me for a benign opinion, but I appreciate your comment so thank you!
---
I quit right after wrath, never made it to 80... Life and all that

I have a bunch of blizzard bucks from selling WoW tokens and even without paying it feels like a waste.

They are prepping it for when it launches. The way it is displayed now is how it will be at launch.

I can't watch the video at work. Would someone explain please?

Some people say queue in the US, and EU player can participate in the stress test by buying a one-month sub
---
God you're the type of person that's a casualist jerk.   It's only a good game played your way slow and ignorant!
---
This game is amazing because so many different types of players can exist.  Altaholics who may never even reach 60 on any toon.  People that only role one character and take it as far as they can.  People with very little time that after a year reach 60 for the first time ever on their only character.  World first guilds that push what is possible in the game.  And everyone in between. 
---
Stop pretending like any playstyle is WRONG.  The only wrong thing is being a judgemental ass.
---
Afaik all hybrids were buffed in TBC
---
I am well aware of this. Thinks tho
---
It doesn't though.  It spends so much time wanking over nostalgia it forgets that outlining your chars =/= developing your chars.  There's almost zero character development in that films past Rey's introduction, and TLJ suffered for it.
---
I just checked it, it said battery 00, going to have to use... my phone !!!
---
I'd really love to see a screenshot of the admin message to "log in or the servers are gonna get shut down" thing. That's actually really funny.
---
Yep. Super nice, just hard for me to watch.
---
Vanilla is pretty good at incentivising players of all kinds to do the right thing. Everyone loses 20% of their rank points every week, so being selfish has a clear penalty. Almost everyone who wants to get a decent rank goes through the same solo hardships before reaching a rank that justifies playing very long hours to get a good standing. At that point one of the good premades have likely spotted you and your playing is completely dependent on their rules. Remember that bg bonus weekends are on a rotation so you shouldn't exclusively be doing the bg you like. If all ways of premade queuing into AV are blocked, you likely won't step into the place after hitting exalted.
---
Classic will be the last time you can get an even remotely equivalent demographic and feel to how the game was in 2004, much like Nostalrius. There will be a huge influx of turbo noobs that have absolutely no idea what they’re doing which results in a completely different kind of game compared to private server #x where the leftover people generally understand things quite well.
---
If you need to win bgs, you need to be the one doing the objectives. You’re going to be queued up with backpedaling ret paladins who farm mid all day. Whether you’re good at running flags or defending bases doesn’t matter, you need to make it happen. Doing that isn’t very fun and a completely thankless job, but by the time you reach rank 10 or so, you’ll be so ridiculously good at the game that you and the 9/14 others who have done it all too will team up and destroy everything. It might not feel very fun getting destroyed by a marshal premade, but those guys aren’t there by accident and have paid their dues.
---
That's a personal opinion. Some people are chasing efficiency to get ahead of the pack. Your version of fun does not invalidate others, and visa versa.
---
See that's what I'm wondering. All the druids I knew in classic were resto
---
Not fair! I did earlier... but seriously fuck your phone.
---
yeah, im not completely sure, but it has appeared available on my battle.net, guess ill find out soon
---
Pets spawn with you, you don't need to resummon them in BG. Recovering from a bank is where it's gonna be tough if the enemy is really camping you.
---
Shaman, pally, and druid can tank 5 mans.
---
Just force the newly logged in character onto the same layer as the last logged in character. Easy fix.
---
A backpack’s worth of patience?
---
I was a hardcore raider in Vanilla, I was in a guild that went server first from MC-Naxx. I became an officer, and eventually led that guild. It was fun, I enjoyed it. But when I think back to what the most fun was. It wasn't the raiding. It was hanging out with the people I had met.
---
I started WoW a couple weeks after launch, if I remember correct. I had no idea what it was. I was a huge Warcraft fan, since humans vs orcs. I never once looked at spreadsheets, or used BiS lists, farming guides or any of that. I just played the game. Because this game does a damn good job at guiding you through its content. And the content is all worth playing. 
---
I was watching Shroud play Classic the other day, curious to see what a FPS players thoughts on the game are. I found it funny, he was saying at one time, that he never really got to experience the Vanilla experience. Having started the game later. But then talked about what his "leveling strategy" was going to be. Practicing his "aoe farming" techniques. Also mentioning he planned on leveling solo as much as possible, and as fast as possible. 
---
Now I know, I know. Let people play the way they want. Sure, you go right ahead. But know, you are missing so so much. 
---
Seared into my brain is the scream of joy from my friend Flerbert(gnomish warlock)getting the Illusionary rod from Scarlet monastery. He was the only person that got anything useful, loot wise, from that run. But we were all so proud we were able to help, and all so happy for our friend. These friends, people I knew ahead of time? Nope. These were others like me, just started playing the game one day. We met while leveling in the Redridge mountains. 
---
I ended up spending the next couple years playing with these guys day in and day out. Exploring the world together, helping each other on quests. Finding some world pvp for the hell of it. Being PART of the world, being immersed in it. That is what made it so amazing. 
---
Not looking up a guide for 'most efficient leveling'. The beauty of this game is in the exploration. Exploring the world, read the quests, become part of it. You start recognizing the same people. You start seeing the same people of opposite factions out in the world.
---
The leveling isn't in the way, it is some of the most fun you will have. And let me tell you. Building those relationships with others and experiencing it together. It is a hell of a lot more fun than AOE grinding by yourself in a corner of the world somewhere.
---
For you that's the best part.  Awesome that's cool man.
---
My best part first time around was becoming the best pvp player possible and rolling with the first HW's on the server in dedicated WSG games where we pushed how fast and how dominant we could be and repeated that success with 100% w/r against pugs and splitting games against the best the Alliance had to offer.
---
It doesn't make me wrong to have enjoyed the Vanilla pvp scene as you're not wrong enjoying the leveling experience.
---
But you ARE wrong for saying one thing was best and others are doing a disservice.  LOL
---
If you want to prioritize tanking in Classic, roll a Warrior. It's that simple.
---
Yeah, you can be dead weight and let guild carry you up till that point when  they actualy need 40 PLAYERS.
---
You are playing wrong and you know you are. Everyone speeds for bragging rights and they think it will impress someone. I know you know I'm right.
---

Isn’t this Joana’s leveling guide?
---
Hmm I’m pulling a blank what’s nightfall?
---
Man, I remember doing this as a tank from time to time when I completely outdpsed someone in a 5 man. Like, it's completely clear they didn't try. In hindsight it was kind of petty, but God it pissed me off to carry some asshole through a dungeon. Waste of everyone's time.
---
Maybe you were bad at raiding and pvp at the time?
---
What else would be the reason? Last month it was "for a chance at beta" this month it's stress test, next month will be another stress test that requires active sub... then August you need an active sub to reserve names.
---
If you are only trying to play classic don't sub until August 11th.
---
If you sub for a chance to play beta - get wrecked nerds.
---
most of the people with that attitude won't even make it to 60
---
Enchanting will be picked up by some people but dropped pretty quickly for gathering professions or changed to a different crafting profession. 
---
The main reason for this is because leveling enchanting is expensive. You need gear to disenchant and using those mats to level it. If you have bad RNG with getting greens at the level you need to get the mats you need you then buy them from the AH or other players. This gets expensive fast and with the gold income being fairly slow leveling enchanting is really slow and drop dependent.
---
This usually causes people to get frustrated with it and drop it for something else.
---
I can’t think of any other reason, but I’m certainly not upset with them.  They’re a company that needs to turn a profit.  If you don’t like it, don’t give them money.  Pretty simple really.
---
People thinking launch is going to be smooth lol. Even if everyone gets in smoothly you have a different problem - whole servers of players concentrated into a few zones.
---
If the respawns are jacked up it kind of works against #nochanges. Good luck finding that girls necklace in Redrige, the Stolen Silver - etc.
---
An XP bar about to burst
---
Disable layering once and for all and just increase server quotas or add new character queues or something
---
Or hell, let the problem fix itself.
---
Maybe if you like retarded green screen flips and endless flynning, but for anyone who's practiced in sword combats it looks like fairy bullshit.  It's all flash and no substance, no real tactics, no real character development, it's bad.
---
Wouldn't have needed to. They could have made it to where we leveled in Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor 1-80. Access to outland and northrend would be gone unless you used the bronze dragonflight if you wanted to level 60-80 in them.
---
Also it's not like we're at work, it was 12pm here, perfect time for a small stress test... Oh well
---
I don't mean to be hating. I simply thought you should have linked from the content creator's channel, so I said so. All my other replies in this comment thread were answering and responding to your questions.
---
Would you really rather have me report you to the moderators, rather than simply telling you what I think?
---
You're right, I never played a maxed rogue in vanilla, only TBC.
---
How will it make leveling easier? Is leveling hard or sumtin. Im missing the point here
---
&gt;But what comes after that ?
---
Burning crusade, probably.
---
Do you ever feel guilty killing quillboar because... well you know.
---
Let's all shower OP with karma for his uniqueness.
---
It's already been tested and proven by a few streamers and it works (both ways too)!
---
Adulting at it’s finest.  I’ll be getting droned on sativa and scotch.
---
I appreciate the advice man. I really am looking forward to classic. I played it back then but was only like 10/11 so never really hit end game. Looking forward to it!
---
Bro, if you got something more interesting to post than surveys then please, post it! Otherwise, fill out the fucking survey and go back to looking up rule34 WoW content like the rest of the sophisticated members.
---
Also despite most of the surveys have higher choices for RP-PvP than RP.
---
&gt; "anyone that says otherwise never played vanilla"
---
My realm didn't have a great PvP environment, and crossrealm was absolutely amazing when it came out. Most people thought so.
---
The only ones that didn't were the premades who already had gear, not liking that they'd get matched against other premades and be beat
---
Mop was maybe the best pvp expansion ever. People hated cata at the time but looking back it was decent. That was the last xpac with real talent trees
---
This is a really concept. Puts a whole lot of meaning behind the new/old character
---
Farming Black Lotus with layer hopping only slight advantage? Yeah sure. :P
---
just tried to login, says, "only available to active subscribers"
---
Good stuff, should help a lot new players understand how playing a hunter for PvP can be a PITA... you play enough you get used to players exploiting the deadzone and it just comes natural, your's and their latency depending can of course through this off.
---
What's your plan in terms of play? Is this a PvE or PvP build or what?
---
As if we needed another reason to hate millennials.
---
Meh, they'll be a Discord server for every realm's faction. Everything will end up there.
---
Yes - and yours is taken already!! 
---
!!!
---
Y'all are overthinking it, this sub is just low on content. :P
---
Obviously /u/Uwis had an office brawl which began with who deserved the first Thunderfury. All downhill from there!
---
It's pretty bad in places.  Harrison Ford didn't want to be their and can't deliver his lines seriously.  Jabba plotline is convoluted and stupid on inspection.  Jabba plotline also is unnecessary and could be written out with a single line.  Empire loses to stupidity.  Bad/forced humor.  Appealing to kids in a distracting and offputting way.
---
The only redeeming parts are Luke's fight with Vader/the Emperor and the space battle, but it's not worth slogging through the rest of that terrible film for those couple moments.
---
Hey at least Geburak went down swinging
---
Sworn to a great divide came out right about the same time as Zul'Aman. Those paired really well for me.
---
Stress test. Closed beta goes to 40.
---
It's always funny to me to see posts about how to rush past the content.
---
Well I care when you're clearly talking out of your ass, warlocks are fucking gods and just because you don't like them it doesn't make them trash lol.
---
It seemed to me you had no idea how to play it or started at lvl 70 on that private server with no actual knowledge from levelling, it's literally the most fun class in the game and can almost two shot burst people in destruction spec..
---
Most people seem to talk about loot council and DKP, but don't talk about EPGP. Guess it wasn't widely as used? I've never been in a loot council guild and I'm sure if the people are trustworthy the system can work. However, joining a new guild with that system I see as personally risky. Especially, if that guild is an older more established guild with a core group (bias). My vanilla guild used DKP which had its issues like hoarding. The members who had been with the guild forever had tons of DKP and could get a few upgrades before anyone else of the same class. EPGP IMO is the best system I have seen so far. I was in a guild for 6 years that used this system. We didn't have any issues. It was better than DKP because we had a decay, so you couldn't hoard your points. If you did hoard your points you would lose more points per week, it was either use it or lose it. Obviously, we had simple rules like main specs would get priority and off specs could only show interest if the main specs passed. EPGP even had an addon to track the people in the guild, which is why I find it interesting that people say DKP/EPGP is too much work. I think if you are actually being fair with loot council that takes more work in figuring out raid attendance and whatever secondary factors that you use to award loot to.
---
Dwarf is better for PvP. For PvE it doesn't matter.
---
Gotta respect the effort
---
feels like the response would be worse if RPPvP wasn't shown as one of them...
---
How dare you compare RotS to WoD!
---
Fail lol. Cata or WoD were definitely not under appreciated, and the force awakens wasn't exactly received well... well i guess that just comes down to who you ask I guess.
---
Warriors were originally thought to be the worst pvp class.  Swifty helped show what you should be doing and then they became the best.
---
The warriors require no skill was not considered the case early on.  They just needed someone to explain how their class worked...
---
I ground 0-60 on a Prot Warrior in Vanilla. At the time I enjoyed it even though my friends thought I was insane. It was pretty grindy though.
---
Druids are a bit interesting. Be prepared to sub some fights to warrior, and go long stretches without getting gear upgrades (almost 0 in MC-BWL and then tons in AQ). Also you have a 1 button rotation for tanking basically (and one other button for aoe!).  
---
Druid is definitely 10x better than pally though, and does have it's uses - it's not just a strictly worse warrior.
---
&gt; but only now are people flocking to the prequels and saying how great they were in light of the Disney-era flicks.
---
Only on Reddit echo chambers, and only because people blinded by childhood nostalgia dominate them.  The general public still remembers them as garbage, with a few obviously unserious "nerd" websites writing shitty articles defending them in suspicious chorus after Disney bought the IP.
---
Is that really their reason? I thought Moon Guard and Emerald Dream were super popular.
---
Really hope they fix this.
---
Tl;dr You don't. You play the game as was intended. No need to watch =)
---
I am. Originally took me a couple months to hit 60. Going to take even longer this time switching sides and batting for the other faction
---
Reported for reporting
---
Warrior or druid. Warrior can tank every boss fight in the game. Druids can tank most but warriors will outshine them most of the time.
---
This was my shockadin build from Vanilla. It's a build that allows you to do great raid healing and decent burst damage in PvP
---
Im pretty sure they're upset that some random guy is on the PC while their guild keeps texting them to log in to heal naxx.
---
What content is he rushing?
---
Alright thanks for the info!
---
That nerf killed the game for me.
---
I was having so much fun in early Cata.  It hasn't been the same for me, since.
---
I did like Legion, but I didn't play the game anywhere near as much.
---
Is there a survey on the whole TBC Classic vs WoW 1.13 debate?
---
I wanted to post one but decided not to bother as all my posts are immidietly downvoted
---
Warlocks are similar to hunters and fit the enchanting theme
---
FWIW, I used to tank MC and ZG using full MS or fury builds. You don't need to spec prot for dungeons and lower raids (I never tried it at higher levels).
---
We're focked
---
It depends on how much pvp you do. If you’re mostly in AV then yea you won’t miss piercing howl/flurry, but if you’re grinding WSG for ranks that 25% damage with near constant uptime is pretty significant.
---
Yikes, sorry.
---
Why bother when its in game in real time?
---
lol, Warlocks already had to stop dpsing... so how much worse off will warlocks end up with this?
---
omg -  thank you!
---
I am  going to get to about level 32 fairly rushed and then enjoy the experience of STVietnam for a while.
---
The video demonstrates a method you can use to get to any layer you want at any time by using alts
---
Haha I like how you are basically applying to be in the Ooga gang with your name
---
Didn't you even bother to read the title?
---
Fine for popcorn flick, but nothing redeeming or worthwhile beyond that.
---
There were least four times this movie made me burst out laughing. 
---
One of them was one Han goes "you need a nickname. I know, I'll call you chewie!"

It was literally a movie of just "oh hey, that's how that got there." And it was laughably terrible.

Let's put the stress test right when everyone's at work.

There is one I didn't expect to see... Used to enjoy 'Cross Out The Eyes' quite a bit
---
Yeah exactly, it feels like this thing will last for centuries lol
---
MSI was one of the best live shows
---
3 piece druid T1 with improved Thorns for the aoe tank? hello?
---
Not sure who told you everyone is going to be a Shaman but, they aren't normally all that popular.
---
Cook yourself. You need breaks anyway if you're playing a lot, it helps clear your mind a bit. Exercise is probably a better break activity, but I understand if a lot of people aren't into that.
---
With Social Groups like "Dungeons" or "Raids" you'll have access to a in-game social network wherever you are in the game.  That means easier access to finding groups to run stuff and no more having to port back to the city to find people to backfill your group when someone leaves, etc...
---
Same. Embrace the mischief!
---
Used to main a shockadin in TBC. It was great fun, but really horrible against Resto druids and Disc priests :P
---
Why wouldn't they have enough time to fix it? Just pull that insight out of thin air?
---
Yay! (I'm having way more fun leveling my druid on beta then I was my warrior, so im thinking I'll go druid to start Classic).
---
Epic crafted 2H axe. "Chance on hit: Spell damage taken by target increased by 15% for 5 sec."
---
Usually surplus offtanks are running Nightfall. We used to give it to paladins, too, for fights when we had surplus healing.
---
Thanks!  I'm hoping to play arcane mage and aoe everything

i used this as a great way to trigger the fuck out of my hardcore classic wow friend :) Hes one of the types who make fun of you for liking anything other than classic and how classic is going to kill retail wow etc.
---
When they got rid of all but 2 servers cause not enough people to stress them i said "hmm guess classic was overhyped afterall"
---
he spent the next 2 hours trying to explain how i was wrong. so much fun
---
So as to make it less of a slog?
---
Nah, by 1.12 Druid tanks could pretty easily hit the armor cap and were solid MTs for most content up through AQ40 and great off tanks through everything aside from a few fights in Naxx. They were also the most efficient healers by the time Naxx rolled around. Good ferals and boomkins weren't topping the meters, but they could hold their own. Every top progression guild had a few Druids in the raid.
---
Launch is still over two months away. Chill
---
you could tank as a prot pally. maybe not MT in major raids where the boss hits hard. smaller content should be fine.
---
Shockadin is pretty shite in vanilla.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Despite not having played WoW in 5+ years, I still remember basically the whole path 1-60. I did it several times and spent hundreds of hours doing so. For this reason, I considered rolling my first Horde character. It’d be exciting to experience new quests/zones/cities. 
---
BUT who am I kidding? Definitely gonna roll a Night Elf or Human like always. I definitely won’t rush. With my schedule I tend to play sporadically and on my own terms. I’ll run the dungeons with PUGs as they come but otherwise I’ll probably solo quest 90% of the time. 
---
Once I hit 60 I’ll find a semi-casual guild for endgame.
---
Seconded
---
There's no explaining done in this video at all.
---
That’s about when I quit. So many left the game altogether. I don’t remember exactly why but guilds jus died left and right during that time span. Most everyone I knew that played during the trilogy quit then. I came back for MOP but the game just wasnt the same anymore, it didn’t have that addicting aspect to it.
---
4 out of 10 yeah. I bet you could go above 4 pretty easily too if you wanted to up the graphics a bit.
---
I'm rolling Undead because I can eat peoples corpses....      
---
That's it.
---
You can do gathering until 60 and reroll. Or you can start out with tailor/enchanting because it's a fresh server and you need that wand.
---
Generally you will outlevel your professions, so it's more efficient to get your mount and go back to gather in low level zones.
---
If the server population is still low then either people did a bad job telling the players about the stress test or retail players interest in Classic is lower than they thought it would be. 
---
Its super embarrassing to have shut down 80% of their stress test servers.  Hopefully the turn a couple back on later.
---
Modern realms will have insane amounts of people,  we don't need it.

This is an authenticator... you press the button and get your auth code. Now Blizzard just has its own Authenticator App for android and iphone.  
---
Source: My work still gives us these authenticators to get into the system. I was never cool enough to get a physical authenticator from blizz.
---
I just don't get the point though. Like you would rather buy from a level 60 instead of a level 60 that uses a bank Alt? Why would anyone care
---
Damning with faint praise
---
I'd go with priest. You enjoy healing, and should have no problem finding a guild.
---
Side note - Kylo Rens light saber fighting was awful... I'm not a huge nerd by "look", but I grew up watching Star Wars and its probably my favorite series of all time. Comparing it to the older fights with Anakin, Yoda, Windu, etc. They were sick, and actual sword fights. Kylo Ren looked like he didn't even know how to hold a sword, yet he was supposed to be a prodigy.... yuck

Thanks for the follow up, I’ll definitely play around with the slider on release and see where the sweet spot is.
---
You fool.
---
Maybe people dont want ro pay 15usd to play for 3 days.
---
It takes a lot of karma farming to hit 60.
---
The gaming community is too mature and rational to do that good sir. /s
---
Did you?
---
No the gold earned raiding can be used for making crafted gear so essentially you can use dkp on crafted gear
---
Go shaman. Seriously. Fits perfectly what you are looking for and it will be a completely new experience for you instead of releveling the same thing you played already.
---
I want server community to matter. I want features that belong in the WoW expansions to not be in Classic. Classic Battlegrounds did not have Crossrealm BGs until right before TBC. Cross realm anything is terrible.
---
This post is new and original... *today*.
---
I definitely stopped taking it seriously with Cata. They took my mana bar away and I stopped knowing how to play hunter like I knew how to breathe. 
---
I’d love to say I got a huge chunk of my life back, not raiding 30+ hours a week, but I just started leveling tons and tons and tons of alts instead.
---
Biggest thing I hated in cata were the class changes. The new talent system sucks. The new spec system sucks.
---
It’s way worse for cat druids than bear druids.
---
Easy. The video is nonsense. He talks about an exploit that makes no sense given how layering works, says it works 100% but never demos it.
---
Obviously.  It's about skipping the death run.  Go die and then ignore everything while you walk past it.  Why are you pretending to be confused?
---
I disagree, I came back for MoP and warriors were overtuned dominant where you could faceroll and still stomp up to 2K rating. That’s when I quit the game for good. CATA pvp was pretty good imo.
---
Nothing beats the EQ ding for me. 😛
---
And didnt charge 15usd to playtest 3 days...
---
Because Reddit getting exclusive monetary value from a transcription of his hard work is hardly fair.
---
My wife's an author.  If someone who loves her work just started throwing together audiobooks (even for free) it would massively hurt her.
---
She's just now trying ot get some onto audiobook but it's a lot of work.  And just because she'd reach more people because someone else converted it to audiobook doesn't make it good for her.
---
Transcribing someone's hard work and posting it freely is akin to stealing.   Even if your giving it away with good intentions.  Your going to severely hurt their listener base (i'd read some of these interviews instead of listen, but they don't create them in Q/A emails so they shouldn't be converted to text against the creators will).
---
If only I could find my old friend Baldorr the hunter. This is such an amazing post(s). So happy for you!
---
Time of day = people at work or school... people with active sub are unable to login... and yeah some people are not subbing until August 12th just to reserve their names.
---
people are unwilling to pay a subscription now just to play in the beta, Blizz showed how greedy they are with this beta and because of it, people have went to private servers to practice their leveling strategy and get refreshed with the game
---
Every upvote I get is one level on a character when classic comes out.
---
Come on guys, smash that arrow. /s
---
Yup. I was a fury warrior throughout vanilla and had little to no trouble not pulling aggro despite constantly being top of the damage chart. 
---
This seems wildly exaggerated.
---
How is he verifying which layer the alts are in?  The clip is rather short, but does every new character made get assigned to its own layer?  I would love to dump my main into a diff layer for early leveling.  3rd char gets 3rd layer?
---
Ads on Twitch...LUL
---
In Vanilla, Warlocks made me crap a little bit
---
Just curious, is there a legitimate benefit to skipping NE leveling zone? Like does dwarf/human zone have better gear/xp rates or something?
---
To be fair, the time they chose to do the stress test is like the worst possible. 4PM EST on a Wednesday? Everyone is either just getting out of work, or if you're west coast your still stuck at work. Plus its a freaking Wednesday. 
---
I'm curious to see if they turn some servers back on when the west coast people are home.
---
I use a piece of paper with two columns: 
---
Chat trolls and Ninjas
---
&gt;Showing him going full MCU fight adds nothing to that other than dumb nerd porn for morons.
---
Says the guy in a subreddit for the rerelease of a 15 year old MMO, haha. The lack of self awareness is impressive.
---
^
---
You are stopping someone from completing a quest. Using a mailbox. Hopping on a flightpath.
---
Just because you enjoy griefing doesn't mean its not griefing.
---
How is he "setting" the layer for each alt?  Does 2nd char get 2nd layer?  And so on?  Or is there a trick you have to do first for each char to get them all assigned to different layers?
---
Lightsaber porn really misses the point of Star Wars imo.
---
Completely agree. They also introduced ranked BG’s which was a nice touch.
---
I'm planning on just leaving my OH in the bank tbh, easy way to solve threat issues.
---
Idk most people consider discord to be much better
---
Nope, [you'll be spamming frostbolt](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300052310231531--053500030013) lik the rest of them. Only one mage in the raid needs Winter's Chill.
---
Except the blizzard forums said that the first 3 hours were the most important of the stress test. No mandated overtime unless they want to crunch some numbers.
---
That's awesome! Yeah it was
---
I take my words back it was easy to get in. It was awesome.
---
There will be waaay too many enchanters for some reason like it was back in the day and even in pservers. My best guess is that people just like the profession very much, because for most of them it does not really make any money and wastes a lot of time to level.
---
There should be no sharding past the Level 30 zones. 99% of the problem solved
---
Nothing controversial about last Jedi it stank worse than the poop I am taking at this very moment. I have been living off fajitas and refried beans for the past week.
---
Google does that too.
---
And everyday there's a bunch of these posts, can we not do that while we are at it?
---
I mean I can kinda see where they are coming from I guess, but it would be nice if it popped up saying I needed an active sub for the stress. I know the beta does, but logging into the stress test I can log in fine. I can even pick a realm, and then it "DCs", which I'm guessing now is because I'm not subbed. Kinda ridiculous to not just have it state that.
---
40 players is never needed, hell there were guilds that cleared naxx in vanilla with less than 40 people. 
---
My point is that people should be let to play whatever they want in terms of dungeons and early raids, of course this is up to the guilds and how they operate, but instead people are so fucking stuck in their ways and won’t allow something unusual or let people enjoy what spec they like to play. 
---
As per my original comment I am more annoyed about the dungeon gatekeeping than raids, but early raids like MC is too damn stupidly easy for anyone to be a ”dead weight” anyway.
---
Immediately made me think of [synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)
---
Never seen it discussed, besides people complaining like you are in the comments sections of the posts I'm referring to.
---
I used to fuck with System of a Down and Sum 41 back in my old WoW days
---
why can't they try and make money?  you want something...why give it to you for free?
---
Yeah name of the game for me was, you had to have incredible burst because that burst only happened every 20 seconds or so xD
---
It's just liking the zones better I think, or meeting up with friends earlier than later.
---
NA logic tbh
---
I'm actually tossing around the idea of finding someone who wants to play a melee hunter and giving him Nightfall so he can spam rank 1 wingclip all fight.
---
Might not be what he hand in mind, but if it lets him live his dream, then I might just roll with it.
---
I found personal blacklists work best. Mainly because I have my own method for blacklisting that may be unorthodox - on a PvP server if an Ally watches while I get killed by a Horde; I literally never want to see / hear or play with you again.
---
How is arms dps a meme
---
It also hurts them that they're requiring a sub for the stress test. I'm not going to pay to help them finish developing their product. I would certainly do it for free, but I wont pay until we get the finished product.
---
For the horde, brother!
---
I’ve got the core hound too, got it a long with the cata collectors edition, still seems to run great, even though I haven’t played wow in years, wonder if it’s almost dead? It has been about 9 years now
---
I mean, that would be nice wouldn't it.
---
I'm definitely part of the younger crowd and been playing for as long as I can remember because my dad has played since vanilla. At the moment I'm more excited for Classic than any new content for modern WoW. It definitely appeals to a younger audience as well as the older folk. I've even managed to persuade some of my friends to play wow with the launch of classic. Normally they wouldn't play because as teens not everyone can afford the expansions (at least in my friend group), but this is the first time in wow where you can access the endgame without paying a base fee.
---
3 solid choices, all really fun and easy to play. Being a good hunter is hard, so maybe not that. If your partner is sorta casual, Warlock may be the way to go. You can summon people, you get a cool pet, and you can give people revive ability. Great for easy friends and leveling. 
---
Not sure about TOS violations.
---
Layering is such a lazy design,  vanilla wow is a game of scarcity. People fight for everything,  herbs, mines, mobs, buffs, dungeons. With layering you remove player interaction and at that point we already have retail.
---
Came here to say this as well..
---
There is nothing new under the sun.
---
Phasing is very different from sharding, layering, or generally any cross server mechanics.
---
How bout now?  My daughter was 10 days late...
---
worked for me and I did pretty well. But to each their own
---
Here from /r/all, haven't played in years. Cata made me quit. If cata is underrated compared to the new ones, what the hell did blizzard do to the game?
---
Well just call EU players
---
There's a huge difference when you play on a PvP realm.
---
Authenticators aren't vanilla! You are going to have your account hacked and you are going to like it!
---
Uhh, so. Hi? I'm not sure how I feel about this. It's great I'm receiving credit via the poster through Reddit, but isn't visible on the sheet itself. Maybe it doesn't matter.  
---
Anyways, the weights which are being utilized on this sheet are specifically for the Nostalrius's Pserver Core. I am currently working on updating the sheet for Classic, which yes, these will change. Also, it's been noticed that Moonfire may become optimal for our rotation in the early phases of Classic due to the unique timeline and structure of the game which no one has ever experienced on a pserver.  
---
I suppose what I'm saying is use this as a guide, but know there will be more concrete and solid numbers coming by August 27. Everyone is welcome to join us on the Druid discord to keep up to date or visit the Nostalrius Class forums (I will publish official updates there.). I sadly try and avoid Reddit since most of the people here are dumb as shit. You know who you are ;)

Because it's no where near as good as Fury and relies on debuffs you aren't allowed to use.
---
The only reason they have "massive threat generation" is if they farm their life away for the pummlers. I consider a spec a meme spec if it needs 15 hours of farming a week just to be on \*almost\* on par with a Warrior.

Evidence required, nothing is final. Solved!

Being a Holy priest is painful for all priests. Shadow is so much more fun. But Holy is what the community wants. Common problem for all priests.
---
If tonight or tomorrow still has severely limited server options then they've vastly over estimated the interest retail players have in Classic WoW I guess. Which is interesting as I would expect everyone would want to at least try it out.
---
The guild should be called Concerted Activity if it ends up being all co-workers. Cool Idea.

the worst part about old pvp videos was commercial hard rock.
---
if I have to see WoW classic pvp videos with disturbed playing over them now, in 2k42019?? honestly, I'll be fine with it. assuming there is a layer of irony.. but I can't stomach another "check out this pvp montages!,!" with "ooo a a a a" for the first 3 minutes, followed by 7 minutes of silence because they didn't bother to put another song in the vid.
---
Nah I’m not going to have an ounce of fun during my week long starvation. Not one bit of fun will be had playing the game I wanted before they even announced it.
---
He doesn't, but I'm sure someone with beta access can go and test it for themselves. Probably either confirmed or debunked in a few hours.
---
Reported.
---
I really enjoyed Cata at the start but I was definitely riding the high of WotLK. I could never get used to the insane jump in HP levels and to this day I hate it - but cata was the first xpac I completed loremaster for before hitting endgame stuff. I remember loving 4.1 and going back into ZA/ZG.. But yeah 4.3 kinda killed it.
---
Why would I care about the copyright laws when I'm not in a country they apply in?
---
I could have gone through 3 8000 hour apprenticeships if I never played WoW.  I'm only halfway through my electrical apprenticeship right now.
---
Let that sink in for a second.
---
Do you know where I could read about that build?
---
I'm pretty thankful for crossreaalm bgs I don't see the issue it's only a battlegroup you will still find the same people much prefer than over 20min ques
---
Are you kidding. The classic leveling experience is the thing I’m MOST excited for. In fact, the closer I get to 60 the sadder I will become.
---
No, but it's still better dps than you'd get out of a healer or a prot warrior. If you're full up on healing and tanking, HotW druid is "first cut" to go dps.
---
Not everyone has the same definition of fun, and I'd say most people would prefer skipping by dying then having to press W for x amount of time, very interactive game-play. I'd rather get to my friends faster and actually start playing instead of claiming running through a too high level zone is fun content.
---
such a shame, too. Revisiting Draenor was fantastic. Shattrath was a huge let down, though.
---
The force awakens is the worst star wars movie. Don’t try to argue with me because you’ll be wrong.
---
This is really a question of which you like better. You are the only one who can decide that.
---
Anybody have a good link to class lore/background? I don’t actively RP but think it’s fun to know more about the class history etc
---
Server community still matters, and they had cross-realm BGs in 1.12 which is what Classic is based on.
---
BFA 3.1 ??
---
whoadude
---
Discord is just better. Its what everyone is using now for Classic, and the game isn't even out yet.
---
Whelp, we’re talking shammy vs pally. Thanks for your input.
---
This existed sort of with world chat
---
on a Wednesday :)
---
My laptop could mostly run Vanilla well, never got to 40 man raiding though. In TBC, however, I did Kara on it before I got a new computer and was told to tank Maiden. The computer was so shit by that time that I couldn't even see her (she wouldn't load in, for whatever reason) from the door of her room. It was hilarious.
---
Honestly cata other then bringing in raid finder was great and mop on game system and game mechanic basis was great other then changing the talent system and I would argue both were better then legion don't get me wrong I enjoyed legion but they were better imo
---
Ooh I can shed some light on this. That’s when there was a mass exodus from the community. It fractured right about then and guilds collapsed right and left. Updates were FAR, far apart so you’d be doing nothing for many many months at a time so the raids were not fun. On top of all of that I think it was the first expansion to be fractured in more was than one where the end game was extremely lonely. Everything was too spread out and you just didn’t interact with other players out in the open world. The map people came to love was destroyed for some quick gimmicks which might’ve paid off for bliz but the community didn’t take kindly to it. And again, it wasn’t the same game as the last 3. People were upset and tired of it. I know the Lich King wasn’t loved for obvious reasons but Cata felt like you were getting the scraps of a better time. It actually really depresses me to think about how many of my friends left the game during cata. All of them. So on top of all of the changes and being in a new world the community turned over hard in that time. Maybe they got a bunch of new subs to replenish those numbers but everyone I knew left for good. 
---
With that said I think the PVP was rather excellent during that time span so no complaints there.
---
Have you forgotten BFA? Jesus, learn with history.
---
I didn't claim it wasn't fun for him.  I said it was funny to me to see it.  I'm waiting to wander around the world, not death walk through it.  I don't care if he rushes past it all.  Still funny.
---
I’ll bet your character was going through so many Ghost Mushroom and Dreamfoil stacks lol.
---
Oh yeh they are completely running their game experience  by playing it the way they want.
---
I think that almost anything can work except Ret Paladin, Enhancement Shaman, Survival Hunter, Discipline Priest, Subtlety Rogue, I'm talking deep into any of those talent trees.
---
It's true, it's just mindless fan service they shoved in to keep the lowest common denominator happy. The same ones that think the prequels were "underappreciated in their time".
---
My plan right now is to play what I want (hunter) and get into raids based purely on showing up.
---
I am the filler for your 40m raids.
---
Even if there was quest text - which there isn't - I wouldn't read it.
---
"It's only beta they'll fix it!"
---
"It's only launch they'll fix it!"
---
"It's only first patch they'll fix it!"
---
"They'll fix it by next expansion!"
---
Weirdly consistent trend of blizzard development.
---
agreed.
---
You can create a US Starter Edition account and add subscription time to it, which will let you play the Classic Stress Test.
---
You're watching a brief clip. He had already proven it on his stream and this was just an explanation on how to do it.
---
4.0.1 Heroics were so beautifully tuned. It's sad that we wont get anything like that again from blizzard.
---
Ok
---
Everything depended on a Big Slow 2 hander and procs -
---
 JoCru, HS, SoCom, DF, HoJ, HS, JoC, SoC  rinse and repeat
---
Classic 3 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LEGION &gt;&gt; CATA &gt; MOP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BFA &gt;&gt; WOD
---
though at the time, everyone was incredibly excited about it.
---
Isn't layering going away after two weeks of launch?
---
He checked it with some characters who were in the starting zone as signs. You can set it up much easier once more people play or guildies help out.
---
I’m not trippin at all. I haven’t taken this game seriously since Cataclysm (Yeah I liked that expansion). 
---
I’m just going to take my time and do whatever I feel like. Maybe even stop leveling from time to time and do some fishing along the way.
---
Source is in comment below you. The text in the blue post automatically updates based on your time zone but if you hover over it you can see 2pm PST.
---
Did you watch the vod you idiot? It's pretty much proven.
---
So I'm probably going to be playing a gnome warlock since my friends are going alliance, and I'll play that with them when they're on, but solo I'm trying to decide what race of hunter to play when they aren't online.
---
I'm anticipating spending more time on my hunter rather than the gnome warlock since I currently just have a part time job. I'm trying to decide between a troll, orc, night elf, or dwarf hunter.  
---
In most other games I tend to be a try-harder/min-maxer, but I don't really want to no-life classic due to the immense time investment. In order I would prefer: BGs&gt;raiding&gt;wPvP
---
Pros/cons of each race:
---
Troll: strongest race fantasy for me, great animations, get to experience horde content as well, but no benefits for BGs
---
Orc: best race for BGs, horde content, but I really hate the look of them
---
Night elf: second strongest race fantasy for me, pretty good animations, shadowmeld in WSG, can trade items between my warlock
---
Dwarf: stoneform is great for PvP, probaly slightly better for PvP than night elves, but the difference isn't as big as orc over troll, can trade items between my warlock, but I'm not the biggest fan of how dwarves look
---
Tauren: nothing against them, just would rather play troll if not min-maxing
---
If you are trying to secure a raid position, my advice is to be as social as possible. If your friend is a raid leader, then you will probably get in. Class and role matter much less. Its not what you know, but who you know.
---
Been playing retail in every xpac.  Mostly strictly arena.  High rated, stressful games (glad+).  I still love arena but am super excited to give it up and just level/relax.  sometimes after a long day of work and gym/school you just wanna chill and game
---
P sure blizz removed their rp name enforcement recently as it was too much work
---
Some truly bad attempts in there. Also really hurt to see the lack of levitation.
---
What is this shit?
---
Why would a 2H fury Warrior ever roll against a Holy Paladin for a 2H? I’d be a little pissed two.
---
It's not surprising if you have played horde on pservers.  Hunters are hard to find and a well played Hunter is near impossible to find.
---
We had Cross-Realm battle grounds in vanilla. I personally prefer it to waiting potentially an hours to queue into a BG. In an ideal world I'd love to be able to pop into a BG with only the opponents from my realm and have that not take an hour, but that isn't this world.
---
Going to try to speed through my first toon to avoid phase 2 pvping. I’ll take my time and enjoy leveling on my 2nd toon. Can’t wait to level both
---
I think goldfish memory is an inherent trait of the blizzard fanboy.
---
Yes. I'll be maxing professions way before hitting 60.
---
&gt;So no one deserves to protect their intellectual property? In other words, everything should just be free?
---
Not at all what I said. I was referring to the copyright abuse that companies like Disney do to keep their properties which should be in public domain under their oppressive control, for example.
---
&gt;You care about your friend, I get it. But making a transcript against Josh's wishes, of HIS work, is not the way to go about it.
---
The community was willing to help those who are unable to hear the podcast, and he shut that down. It's an ablest move and a dick one at that. 
---
&gt;He even suggested that your friend and people in a similar situation take contact to him.
---
So every single person who is unable to listen should personally ask him for transcripts? That's highly inefficient, and highly embarrassing for some people.
---
&gt;Or you could link your friend the podcast, and he/she could get it transcribed professionally. So that everyone who puts work into their business, gets PAID just like other people do.
---
Why would someone do that, when there was a community member who was willing to do that service and help? Just because he want's to extract every single penny out of his viewers and disregard those with disabilities? Its disgusting.
---
WoW has barely ever had classes tuned to within 5-10 percent from top to bottom.. thats a hilarious assumption.
---
Maybe some people have fun leveling really fast.  Plenty will do both
---
Battlegroups were not the death of pvp communities/competivness within the battlegroup and people knew those players in their battlegroups all they do is allow you to que without a 1hr wait time between games and for those servers with imbalanced populations they can actually que and find games.
---
But it's literally vanilla.
---
What the fuck...
---
Theres way more pros to cross realm battle grounds
---
Shorter queues, fixes faction imbalances, adds value to your PvP rank, and most importantly makes it so pvp doesnt outright die on some realms like it did in the past and does on pservers
---
Oh dear not the old a post about a post about a post
---
It was a perfect timing. Horde tended to dominate in PvP in vanilla. So many Alliance players desired to switch to Horde, but they didn't like the ugly races so Blood elves gave them the chance to keep the aesthetics while going Horde. Expansion itself was also a great time to change.
---
Big dumb dumb move by blizz for a proper stress test lol
---
Do you wanna charge in, or hit your enemies from a distance?
---
Oh dang you must be subbed and in the stress test like everyone else
---
WoW was how I found out about Bodom. Had a guildie always talking about how awesome pvp was with them on.
---
How is Force Awakens rated so highly imo it was worse than the whole prequels. Also cata might actually be the worst expansion cause it had the big shift from an mmorpg to a glorified handy game.
---
Does he explain how to assign each character a diff layer?  Or are all chars created on subsequent layers after the first?
---
That's not true at all.  This is a stress test, not a beta, not a full release.  There is no way to know until really until release.  Even the beta realms population have decreased.
---
Aren’t rogues not all that great at soloing?
---
Yes, there's an interview floating about somewhere.
---
Yeah im not waiting an hour for your "community" feel to play a BG. It wasn't like that in Vanilla, so idk what you're even talking about
---
Join in on the stress test for classic today and I think tomorrow ?  They opened this stress test for everyone 😁
---
Ok, I've sent an email to m
---
“How dare this company ask for money in return for goods or services!”
---
plan to make a guild with this mind set. Its classic, the raids aren't that hard we'll get by.
---
And no crossrealm means nonstop Q dodging into endless empty BGs where they would have to custom implement a deserter for not accepting BG Qs. You deserve all the downvotes. Go world pvp if you want to see your server.
---
Cause cata killed wow... wod might be the second worst expansion content wise but they made no radical changes they just let their game continue dying. MoP was actually pretty good in terms of stuff to do and raid quality its world was even better than legions.
---
At all costs?  So just not play then?  How about no.
---
You are underestimating how low the damage of these specs are, and how hard it's going to be to "carry" if your raid has more than a handful of them. I know the raids aren't tuned as tightly as the higher end content on live is now, but the game was a different beast back then. A 40-person raid with half of their DPS in "meme" specs just isn't going to clear some bosses purely by virtue of their healers going OOM \*well\* before the boss dies.
---
One or two is fine. Hell, on horde side, a DPS shaman or two is actually really great, especially once your melee group gets geared and can take full advantage of WF. But a raid with three or four rets, a handful of balance/cat dps, etc., especially at the start before everyone's relatively geared, it's just not going to be feasible unless all 40 players are doing perfectly, and even then it'll be tough.  
---
And as you go on, as the gear and tier sets start completely outstripping what can be done with off-spec sets, a raid with the crap specs in it will just continue to fall further and further behind raids with real setups.  
---
And in dungeon content, while some specs like balance druid aren't as bad because they can stop to drink, while you'll be mostly fine, you're talking about runs that already take multiple hours. Bringing a balance druid and or a ret or other low-performance specs just makes those dungeons take \*even longer\*. It's just really, really not worth it. And most people are going to see that once they get into the game.
---
Wait, are the characters created during this stress test the ones that we will use for actual classic?
---
To all future voluntary content creators: make sure you cover every fucking impairment there is (even made up ‘ocd’) and make it accessible. And make sure to avoid click bait by using the most boring titles (tip: use dissertations in physics as reference). And yeah you’re not allowed to make any money from it even if it’s your content is free and people give it to you.
---
At launch there won't be BGs to participate in. That will roll out several months later
---
I want cross-realm BGs and they were part of an authentic Vanilla experience, so the only thing I say "no" to, is you.
---
I have a tendency to min/max when I can, but it is undeniable that the drive to be the best and to be efficient takes something away from the game. This topic cones up in regards to simple leveling in Classic. You can power level and rush through the content, get to 60, rush through dungeons, rush to raiding, farm mats, etc. On the other hand this is the chance of a lifetime to replay the game with new people (for me my wife, kids, co-workers that only played WoW after vanilla). Taking the time to experience it fresh brings back that sense of wonder and discovery.
---
I'm not going to be upset if I only have an hour to play and I spend the whole time riding a boat and walking slowly through a zone trying to avoid dying without competing a single quest.
---
My guild is casual AF, full of meme-specs and is halfway through Naxx after 2 weeks. The Guild Leader has TF / Qiraji mount and plays in Fury spec. 
---
He may be a “hardcore” player but the guild is known to not turn anyone back at all. The whole atmosphere is to have fun.
---
I think people will be surprised by what a decade has done to players. We aren’t going to be spending 5 nights a week to clear MC BWL and Ony after they are initially cleared.
---
You forgot moonfire : )
---
Damn i just got oofed
---
I'm looking forward to leveling, but I also don't have any friends (from Vanilla or Retail) who will be joining me in Classic. My guild in Vanilla had a solid network of RL friends behind it, and many of us still keep in touch. Being guildless and clueless on who to play with, my plan is to level and build up some friends on the way to 60. With any luck, I'll find a good group of people to do stupid things with, and re-find the fun.
---
The 2000’s Star Wars were not under appreciated, they were and are horrid. Just because enough time has passed for you to either forget about or get used to jarjar and the other bullshit doesnt make it any better.  No amount of memes or prequel fanboy nonsense will change that either.
---
These characters aren't going to be used for actual classic?
---
Or they completely underestimated the amount of EU players were on the earlier stress tests.
---
Am I the only one that stopped using keyboard bonds after getting a naga?
---
yeah i've seen way more "just have fun" posts than tryhard posts on this sub
---
It just seems as if nobody is going to be taking their time because there’s not really a lot of content to be made for that crowd. Meanwhile, speed leveling alone generates tons of content. So while we’re in a content drought, the hardcore crowd will be more vocal about their plans come launch day, while the casual playerbase is posting and upvoting more memes and nostalgia related content.

the once vocal minority are now the majority and hey look at the game now.

Ahh yes WoD underappreciated in it's time
---
To do that he'd have to wait for x * 3000 players to log in for each layer (assuming they keep the 3000 characters per layer).
---
But the dumbest part is: why does only the FIRST character go to the last logged in layer? Wouldn't b the third ALSO go to layer 2, like the first character did? Clearly only the first character forgetting it's layer is due to magic.
---
I think you’ll respec pretty fast in Classic.

Glory to the great Taladril and the mad Keftenk!

Thanks for providing a link so the clip that totally proves this to be true!

Seems legit LUL

Thanks for your input but I want to be at the TOP of the dps chart, I'm thinking arcane explosions on multiple enemies will get me there

I just had vietnam flashbacks to that Molten Core anniversary event. I spent hours in there trying to do it and gave up because it was a test of mental fortitude, not personal skill.

Players from Retail suuuuucked at it. But I will say most people suck at things they haven’t practiced in a long time.

I'm 99% sure no.

I just wish I could be guaranteed a spot if I subbed for the actual beta (not the stress test). I don't want to spend 15 dollars just to not get in. I have bought every expansion and played most of them for atleast 4-5 months (most of vanilla, all of TBC and Wrath, Off and on for each expansion after that. BfA I haven't played much at all, but did buy it and play a bit).
---
Hunters do struggle before 10 compared to when they obtain their pet. Multiple mobs are an issue for most classes especially when spawning untimely. 
---
Leveling on the beta seems to be harder than on private servers. At least that is what I've heard from speedlevelers.
---
That article is from 2010, well into the steam days
---
Unemployed testers unite!
---
Everyone just looks at the same spreadsheets, blogs and YouTube videos. All the same points about the factions, races, and specs have already been made and until the humans actually get to play, all anyone can do is refer to OTHER spreadsheets, blogs and YouTube videos for further discussion.
---
Lol Cata and WoD should be "no thanks" and BFA should be "garbo"
---
He's still missing out on all the danger.  Danger is why PVP servers are fun.  Danger is why that run is fun for some people.
---
Sorry no here: www.reddit.com/user/TerribleScarcity/comments/c2olmf/sanctum_of_light_paladins/
---
WoD raids were amazing
---
Not sure exactly how many others share my sentiment, but I think if WoD had as much of a consistent content stream like Legion or MoP, it would've been a good expansion in my books. I was indifferent about Garrisons, liked the Draenor perks, and I thought the class changes were really fun. WoD Survival Hunter and MM Hunter goes down in my books as the absolute most fun those two specs have ever been.
---
"The city must be purged!"
---
Authentic? They were in the game for a few months? How is launching classic with cross realm battlegrounds authentic? The game didn't have crossrealm battlegrounds until it was almost over.
---
Geez I wonder where mine is.
---
Mage is more technical and warrior is more RNG. Both are amazing at PvP.
---
 It sounds like you've played wow before so why not go with your gut, and make a friend nice enough to let you play their (mage/war) sometimes?
---
If you played on p servers you would understand how important it is. For instance if you want to get high pvp rank with cross realm there's a good chance you will need around 1.5 to 2 million honor a week to be in the top 100 and that's not even very good.
---
There is *nothing* new in Classic WoW. We know all the raids and all of the content. Why exactly would a max level cap in a closed beta for current subscribers *only* kill the hype? The majority of people excited for Classic can't play as we've all unsubbed from WoW for years. Sure, some true die-hards re-subbed just for a chance at beta or for 48 hours of the stress test but that's far from the majority.
---
&gt; people will be forced to watch streamers clear endgame content for weeks until release 
---
lol, wut. If watching a game for a lil bit kills your hype for it, maybe you're not actually interested in playing? I'll never understand these people who simply can't turn Twitch off.
---
agree i found LFR to be too damaging to the raiding experience. It really changed the feeling of boss encounters. trivialized it to the point you can afk the entire encounter with no repercussions
---
That’s just how the games gotten. you don’t have to group up for anything because it’s all solo content. Everything has lost value because it does nothing for your characters (Professions). Gold comes naturally in large amounts so it’s worthless... I mean there’s so many things that are different and possibly for the better of the game, but there were too many that removed social components and that’s what really killed it. It’s when it became cross realm everything tbh. Phasing was a huge axe to the social aspect... you never see anybody more than once because you’re on 1 of 500 shards that contain 3 players each.
---
Bring the fun I'm down with...but don't forget CC is an actual thing again in Vanilla.

Most 5 mans you can squeeze by without it...but don't expect me to give your meme spec a spot when we need Locks on Garr.

Very similar but I'll have greater wisdom. God, talents are great.

And still, the fundamental point is that Josh wants to continue to provide his podcast for free. Whatever business model he chooses for this to work, is up to him and has nothing to do with being ableist. Again, he suggested alternatives that provide both him and other professionals with a way to generate revenue. There is nothing disgusting about that, and it's frankly pathetic that you are trying to make him look like a bad guy.
---
The only thing that is apparent from your post, is that you don't care about the whole hearing-imparied issue. You care about providing people, INCLUDING those with hearing issues, with free transcripts against the owner's wishes. That is the only disgusting part and it makes me believe you have no clue how to run a creative business and the challenges that comes from it.

Anyway, this has gone on far too long. See you in classic!

Because you don't have 60% of the alliance running around with fear immunity.

Ahh, I see. Thank you!
---
So I mained a human mage from vanilla through MoP and then quite WoW altogether.  I have never raided as a melee or healer.  I have narrowed my choices down to 3.  My group of friends will be going horde this time around so here we go:
---
Orc Warrior - Never played a warrior past lvl 20.  I would like to tank but then I worry about the responsibility of the party/raid on my shoulders.  If I want to DPS I'd just play the mage.
---
Troll Priest - I also have never healed.  I was hoping to go shadow but I remember how mana inefficient they are in raids but how amazing they were in PvP.  I would probably be relegated to heal in raids and I'm not sure if raid healing is something I want to do.
---
Undead Mage - Fits like an old glove; no learning curve; I love having portals, vending machine, and having the best controlled CC in teh game (poly)
---
I wouldnt say no benefit for trolls in bgs, berserker isnt nothing. 
---
If you hate the look of orc, probably not a good fit. You're going to be staring at this thing a lot.
---
Shadowmeld with a stealthed pet everywhere, not just wsg. Wisp travel time in wpvp is huge, gank potential increased 50% after death :P
---
Dwarves, again with aesthetics. But stoneform is sweet, and you get a free pass on being drunk all the time. Also, their height can be an advantage, ie) hiding in bushes for the ambush.
---
Seriously, Swiftness Pots could go at 200% run speed and you couldn’t get me to farm a set of Manual Crowd Pummelers.
---
Free Action Potion is all you need really, but Stoneform (Dwarf racial) is extremely good too.
---
Another useful item is: Elixir of Poison Resistance (dispels Crippling Poison, no cooldown)
---
As for Stealth, and people saying Track Hidden is not worth it, here's a quick summary how it works:
---
As I'm sure you noticed already, it's easier to detect rogues/druids lower level than you.
---
**5 stealth points corresponds to 1 level**. So a rogue 10 levels lower than you need +50 extra stealth points to effectively be hidden as if they're the same level as you.
---
Conversely, you need 5 stealth DETECTION points to effectively reduce a rogue's stealth by one level.
---
Some examples: 
---
* Shadowmeld (NE racial) gives +5 stealth points. A Night Elf rogue's stealth is therefore always 1 level more efficient.
---
* Master of Deception (Rogue talent) gives +3 stealth points each. 5/5 talent points in MOD, means a rogue's stealth is increased by 3 levels.
---
These effects are cumulative, so a Night Elf Rogue with 5/5 MOD talents, has stealth equivalent to 4 levels higher than they are.
---
As for the abilities that increase your stealth detection (or lower your opponent's stealth level, if you prefer):
---
* Catseye Elixir (Alchemy potion) gives +10 stealth detection, meaning you detect stealthed enemies as if you're 2 levels higher.
---
* Catseye Ultra Goggles (Engineering head gear) gives +18 stealth detection.
---
* Perception (Human racial) gives +50 stealth detection for 20 seconds.
---
Now for the fun part...
---
* Track Hidden give +30 stealth detection. That's a whopping 6 levels! 
---
**And again: ALL these effects stack.**
---
So if you're a Hunter, wearing Goggles, and drinking a Catseye Elixir, you get +58 stealth detection which corresponds to nearly +**12** entire levels. In other words, this is more effective than having Perception active, CONSTANTLY. 
---
(Oh and also, if you're lucky enough to have a Felhunter with Paranoia around too, that's another +6 levels for a grand total of 18.)
---
Whether this is useful or not, I'll let you decide. But I assure you it's easier to detect someone in stealth who is 12 levels lower than you, than someone who is the same level - and vice versa.I'm willing to bet anyone who says you don't notice a difference have never experienced it themselves. 
---
There's also the added bonus of stealthed enemies *showing up on the map*, when Track Hidden is active, so you don't necessarily have to target them - just use Flare as soon as you see them nearby.
---
You can try all this out yourself, or better yet, look up individual abilities/items at ClassicDB: 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19885](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19885) \- the line that says "Apply Aura #17: Mod Detect" is the extra stealth **detection** points you get.
---
(or [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=21009](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=21009) \- the line that says "Unknown Aura (154)" is the extra stealth points a rogue/druid gets.)
---
Recently removed mine for the phone app. That thing is OLD. I'm scared the battery is going to die.
---
Were you Alliance/world buff stacking into 1,5k+ dps?
---
Cross realms are classic so go for it. #nochanges
---
That's exactly what it does now, and what he's abusing to control which layer he logs onto. The game doesn't remember the layer of your last character when the client is first started, so you essentially set the layer you want to join by first logging on the character already on that layer. You can then switch characters and log any of them onto the layer of the last logged on character until the client is closed again.
---
How many of you actually played Classic pre 1.12
---
&gt;The only stat I know for sure is that less than 1% ever killed a boss in Naxx.
---
2006, the year I was a one percenter. And now, thanks to my student loans, my neth worth is negative.
---
Yeaah, no.
---
8 was a urine-soaked ash heap in a dumpster.
---
Of course, that was a direct result of Johnson having to figure out some way to put out the fire Abrams had set with 7, so.
---
''under apprecaited'' Yeah i appreciate how Cata introduced flying mounts to the world which killed the commutiy instantly  good luck meeting people on the roads or knowing which players tried to kill u for hours on end. Oh look Mop continuiation of disaster with bunch of pandas, Oh Warlords is this even an expansion? felt like a mobile game. Legion? only well recieved because of loads of fanservice and nostalgia towards burning cursade , Everything after Wotlk wasn't an MMO anymoe. Sure u can Cata had good pvp in arena but thats not an mmo. Quite annoying when people ignore the fact cata killed the game, yes dungeon finder was introduced at the end of Wotlk but that didnt kill the communtiy it harmed  it but  being  fllying all over the place killed mmo.
---
By that argument you could say NAXX wasn't in until late in vanilla and since most people didn't reach it anyway, they might as well not include it.
---
No, Rogues have no utility. They're all damage and they top the charts in exchange for no group utility
---
If you want utility and to be a DPS class you should roll Warlock or Mage.
---
Ret is a meme spec and its just not good in vanilla
---
yikes
---
But vanilla realms had a cap of what 2,500? And nowadays they have the capability to increase that cap to 4-5k easily, with caps that high i doubt we would have much issue with BG que times
---
&gt;Attempting to balance all classes and all specs so everyone was 100% equal? Sucked. 
---
Not even. They made all specs viable, but far from equal. It was remarkably well balanced while maintaining class and spec flavor.
---
no you’re the only person

In Naxx, yes.

---

---
Anyone who has been on WoW in the last 5-7ish years will most likely be accustomed to speeding through the “junk content” because thats what happened when people started in WoTLK / MoP / WoD - they had no choice but to speed through to end-game just to play with most of the server.
---
Bad comparison since Warlords of Draenor was definitely the worse expanison ever and the first 2 Star Wars prequels are still garbage. 
---
The Last Jedi is also an underappreicated masterpiece.
---
I mean, I agree that if you think you're going to tank with a shaman you're not going to make it very far.. But there are some "meme specs" that might be rough around the edges, but can still do enough dps to where if the person playing it isn't brain dead they can easily hold their own. I'm never gonna argue that raids should be happy bringing 6 feral druids, 3 ret paladins, 4 shadow priests etc.... but raids aren't going to fail to clear content because they have one or two of these specs around.
---
It would be good if they changed the algorithm to hold you for a bit then drop you into a game with other players from your realm. They did that with the dungeon finder in retail and it was certainly much more noticeable above complete random.
---
Yeah, but it’s talking about the period from 2004 to 2006.
---
Only reason I'd want crossrealm is if the server is DEAD combined with OTHER dead servers.
---
MoP is probably the most circle jerked expansion on Reddit
---
I don't have the energy to run Guilds anymore, but the urge to do so is high. My schedule doesn't align with most guilds I've seen and ugh- The mentality of some WoW players is such a huge turn off. The perks of being a Guild Lead was being able to gather up like minded people I actually *enjoy* being around.
---
Naxx came out 2 months before cross-realm battlegrounds, should we get rid of Naxx too?
---
Yeah, I'm just afraid the min-maxer in me is going to regret if I don't roll orc/dwarf. But the fantasy loving part of me won't like being an orc. I guess it's just a grass is greener on the other side haha.
---
Well it's not a shady cash grab. It's just good business practice. It turns out companies need money to pay for employees and expenses and such.
---
It sounds weird to base it on DPS. If one person gets 1-2 items before another person, they will have better DPS than them even without having more skill. Same skill + better gear = better DPS. Now they will have all items first, and the other guy is screwed until the end of Classic.
---
You said you weren't fussed on PVE, and were primarily looking to PVP. You said you wanna raid. You said you liked utility and flavor abilities.
---
You said Rogue.
---
Exactly. These players aren't even taking into account for the layering and other ways can combat the issue. Instead just copy paste a system that was barely in Classic WoW, and is no way representative of how Battlegrounds were for most of the game's life.
---
I can see, hear and feel this.
---
He isn't. He's blindly guessing at how the system works and nochangers are taking this as gospel truth that classic will suck.
---
I'm all for play what you want but some of the meme specs literally do nothing.
---
People just need to drop the retail mindset and remember specs used to be for certain things, leveling/pvp/raiding etc. If you want 30 playable specs then play retail

With the time that they picked to start the stress test, they may have overestimated how many people would be playing, or underestimated the number of people who would like to play, but you know, work, and/or don't live in the right time zone for starting right at 2pm ET.

You might outdps the tank if you're lucky with your arcane explosions.

Sun tea, smoothies, crock pot and one pan baked meals are my current jam.

Not at all. You have the mentality of needing your instanced content right now. At all costs. Without considering the ramifications it has on other aspects of the game. Aspects which differentiated Classic WoW from the expansions.

Simply not true, played on a ps recently, every single fight mana was at least 80% down even on non healers and when playing ele shaman I could kill 2 or 3 people without mana issues
---
Best comment!
---
Heroic and mythic Blackrock Foundry was the most fun I’ve ever had since ulduar and ICC. Warlocks were super fun and engaging to play, and the stance dance demo spec was hands down the most fun caster I’ve ever played
---
you wish more like 3m+
---
I'm confused your pro-layering but, anti cross realm BG's?
---
That is like saying we should have arena, because arena was in classic. Which it was.
---
U need 1. Frostbolt.
---
Exactly. If they needed the first 3 hours to be the most important, they should have picked a better time. Like an evening, or a weekend.
---
yeah, early cataclysm is probably my 2nd favorite time in WoW, first being all of TBC. I can't exactly give my opinion on vanilla as I was like 11, and joined in late 2006 but to me those pre nerfed heroics were something like TBC heroics but much more interesting. 
---
Was really the best experience I had as a tank in all of WoW. I really didn't experience much of the hate that people back then clamored. Our groups hit walls occasionally and wiped a few times but it reminded me of the Pserver Vanilla experience I had in 2016, we just talked, strategized, and when we won we got some well deserved loot.
---
I stayed for after the heroic nerfs and enjoyed the first 2 raid tiers. Firelands was dope. Then LFR/DS and the rehashing of the troll heroics was like a death blow after I saw the heroic nerfs. That was the day blizzard lost their balls IMO.
---
Wait this implies WoD is good
---
Its blizzard we are talking about here there is no time to chill!
---
Fooked idd
---
Why did they stress test when most of the US was at work?
---
i thought feral was an acceptable dps in raids. Maybe i am remembering a totally different version of vanilla.
---
The Last jedi has a lot of things that just make no sense at all in it, like for instance, the whole casino subplot, that whole subplot just makes no sense being in the final cut of the film, theres more parts that make little to no sense but there isn't a reason to get into it on this subreddit.
---
Can you name any character from Rogue One?
---
How do you check the battery level?
---
Lmao the feral tanks are the best speedrunners AND the best at TPS especially with MCP, dunno what are you on
---
The servers nowadays can hold far more than 2,500 players. Partly due to layering. There is a huge difference between layering and playing with somebody from another server. You have no way to ever interact with that player in the open world. You can literally play a crossrealm battlegrounds you will never see or talk with ever again.
---
Exactly if you are trying to take arena out of classic your a jerk.
---
Layering goes away when your server pop is 3000 or at the start of phase 2
---
its ok layering will take care of this
---
Mash the randomize button.
---
Got a naga too, never can have too many binds

What exactly was the point in bringing up a hypothetical situation where someone is doing 50% less DPS than someone else then kicking them? I've said that people should strive to learn their class to a T, and doing 50% less DPS than someone else only falls under the category of someone who doesn't know their class and how to play or they're basically afk pressing 1 button and not paying attention. If it's the latter situation then, again, yes you probably should replace them.
---
Further, I basically agreed with you:
---
&gt; There's literally nothing wrong with min/maxing if that's how you want  to play and you should endeavor to seek other players who share that  mentality. 
---
So I don't know why you keep bringing this up: 
---
&gt; If you want to raid with 39 other people you conform to the raid. It's  that simple. If you are too lazy to get consumables or play to the best  of your ability, then dont be surprised when the raid wont take kindly  to your complete disregard of their time. 
---
To again, quote my own post that states one of my original points which you may have missed:
---
&gt;  Again, what's wrong is the people who try to convince everyone else that you *have*  to do it just to raid or do anything in PvE, which is completely false  and leads to a lot of people stressing out over nothing and not enjoying  the game. 
---
"It" being min/max every single thing about your character and get every single consume and world buff every time you step into a raid. People telling other people that they have to do this are completely wrong and are causing newer players to be turned off by the game, which sucks because they'd probably enjoy it if they gave it a chance and ignored these people. 
---
&gt; But the gain in power from using the consumes are so massive in Vanilla  that not using them is just lazy behaviour. This is a fact. 
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about. I'm sorry but not wanting to farm extra hours for gold/mats for a bunch of consumes and spending extra time getting world buffs which you might realistically lose while running to the raid if you end up dying  (if you get ganked, if you fall, if some other random BS happens) isn't lazy behavior. If people don't want to do that then they don't have to, and you definitely don't need to if you want to clear these raids. If you want to join a guild that requires you to do so, that's on you and only you, but don't go around telling everyone else they're lazy fucks when they just want to get in the raid, kill shit, get loot and have fun. 
---
About the only thing I consider lazy is not getting enchantments on your weapons and maybe some of your armor as they are easy to acquire and add an extra oomf to your character, but if people make it to 60 it's pretty obvious that enchantments are sweet and people will probably go get them anyways.
---
I thought I heard somewhere that humans used Tauren slaves so that had an impact on it. Could be wrong
---
Or to "prove" that there isn't as much interest as there is, or to pat themselves on the back for having proper infrastructure... 
---
Not that I'm a pessimist.
---
You cant Just casually compare legion to such crap as episode VII
---
With all cooldowns up, there's just about no class a skilled rogue can't beat and if you want to be an absolute pest and keep people locked out of their characters for lengthy durations, you can with Cheapshot, Gouge, Blind, Sap etc.
---
Same here but it was the end of Cata for me.
---
Hour of twilight had been out for a little and Kung Fu Panda had been announced.
---
Cata had dropped significantly in quality but I liked some of the story telling mechanics that they'd been building since Wrath with more 'scenes' with main characters.
---
But the second I saw that Panda's were up next I noped the fuck out and never came back.
---
Having no idea what you're talking about, but penning a treatise as though you do is a much worse look.  
---
Soul Link gives a warlock all the staying power they need for their sustain to take full effect - bleeding a Warrior to death was an inevitability, not an exception, clown. If you actually played the game at ALL, you'd know that. No, we didn't need luck and cooldowns to beat hunters. It was a foregone conclusion. You clearly have ZERO idea how warlocks actually engage or play out a fight - you're just vaguely aware of some of their abilities. Just stop while you're behind.
---
Yeah true, but you get to be big boy in big armor with a big sword. Beats everything else
---
Wow what a horrid misuse of that meme. We're not talking about some new mmo of dubious quality and questionable decisions like archage or god damn tree of savior, where the "problems" would require a game to be redesigned from the ground up with a different marketing model. We're talking about a temporary mechanic and a handful of bugs.
---
If major bugs like spirit of redemption immortality aren't fixed by the week leading up to release, you'd have a leg to stand on, but you don't. This whole board is infested with chicken littles.
---
nah bro that makes too much sense
