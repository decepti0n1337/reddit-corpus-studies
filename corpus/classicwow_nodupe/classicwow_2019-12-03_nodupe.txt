It was already kind of useless. It's really hard for a large sub to be anything more than an image board unless the mods are really good about it (love it or hate it, r/games accomplishes this).
---

---
You essentially have to ban memes, fanart, "my girlfriend made this", etc. from the main sub.
---
What’s the issue with pre-totem? It’s not like there is a huge cd and barely any mana was used. Am I missing something? 
---
Thing I don’t understand is removing lightning shield. Do dmg on hit abilities sometimes bug and break saps? That’s the only thing I could think of.
---
I legitimately don't know what you are on about. We agree.
---
I feel like when I was using a faster bow I'd have auto&gt;aimed&gt;instant auto and I'm not seeing that with the carapace spine. I'm trying to figure out if I'm doing something wrong.
---
First off, I don't have a 2nd raid group.
---
The things that lead to those issues down the line are due to poor management, it puts a lot of stress (more than anyone person needs) on the guild leader/ officers. 
---
I'd rather have our guild run as a guild instead of a corporation, I dislike the idea of having middle management officers in charge of raid teams that I'm not apart of just for the sake of making our guild larger.
---
Theres no advantage of having a bigger guild unless like I said you're sapping gold from players.
---
Please don't put an end game enchant on a leveling weapon.
---
Turns out no ideas are unique and everyone has the same idea
---
Enjoy being a godlike dungeon tank, but make sure to pick up your prebis heal shit if you have any intention of raiding.
---
&gt; ret paly
---
&gt; pocket paly
---
Pick one. And stop spelling pally wrong.
---
I don't think many DPS bother with (or even need to bother with) FR gear. Fire Res/Greater Fire Res potions really provide all you need since you can pop one before the fight and one during.
---
So you actually choose who gets your honour? I like this as I have had some really good 1 on 1s and would have happily given them honour for having defeated me. I would also like to deny a bunch of  griefing fucks their "honour". 
---
Unfortunately I don't think the majority of people are mature enough to embrace a subjective system like this. I think you need an objective measure but certainly a better one than we have atm. 
---
Also when do rogues get nerfed? The fact that they can just freely gank capitols is not only a pain in the ass, it breaks the immersion imo.
---
Pretoteming in duels is scummy as it doesn't really simulate a real fight, but if you are going to do that stuff then at least wolf form so they can't just immediatley be removed.
---
This is unsafe for work reddit content! LOL
---
So OP is saying OH won’t miss after MH with HS queued and you’re saying cancel right before MH swing so I’m a bit confused.
---
Absolutely. You are one of the best pvp classes the entire game. Additionally, you said "end game raid." While gear is good if you can at least get Arcanist and Netherwind pieces you will be competitive the entire game. Obviously if your server is hyper competitive it'll be worse, but aq40 will start destroying guilds and people will drop off in gear.
---
You can get bonebiter at 34/35 and it's pretty much a direct upgrade from the ww axe.
---
I main mage but also tank. No problems waiting, but when everyone's good to go, please just go (or communicate in some way). Waiting literal minutes for the tank to pull one mob or a single small group is not reasonable *every time*. Just mark and move, or I will get antsy and irritated.
---
It shouldn't take 45 minutes to not even be at the first Zig in Strat UD, almost wiping 'cause the healer was afk since we were waiting so long for the next pull.
---
Mana breaks, bio breaks, even some amount of standing around, whatever. But it seems like half the tanks (on my server, at least) are doing fantasy football trades on the side they take so damned long. They also have no idea how to tank (read: if you're constantly losing aggro to the DPS, who are *all* using spells and abilities from *several* tiers ago, because you refuse to use defensive stance, aren't prot specc'd, and are marking nothing? that's a *you* issue. also, unbind 's' if you're not going to look behind you, you absolute mongoloids).
---
Patch 1.4 was nothing like phase 2.
---
* Ragnaros world first happened AFTER patch 1.4.
---
* Most players were leveling or hadn't even started playing.
---
* The few 60s were running dungeons and doing raids most nights.
---
* Nearly nobody logged on to farm honor specifically.
---
* The few that did farm honor mostly did so in Southshore.
---
* Almost nobody had Epic mounts.
---
* Almost nobody had engineering.
---
Anyone insinuating that this mess is anything like Vanilla has no credibility.
---
Had this happened in Vanilla, the Honor system would have been changed drastically, if not obliterated.
---
Wonky specs I've tried as Warlock that differ from the SM/Ruin, DS/Ruin, SM/DS normal stuff:
---
**Fel Dom / Conflag** 0/17/34. This spec was quite fun with lots of +fire damage gear. You're a tankier nightflag spec minus the nightfall, with 15% more stamina and two HUGE 2.4k voidwalker shields since you have improved Voidwalker and Fel Domination/Master Summoner. This spec shines in PvP-- you're hard to kill and you can also light people up with immolate + deathcoil + shadowburn + conflag. It's also surprisingly not bad in 5-man content, since you can spec into improved imp AND improved firebolt, giving you a machine gun imp. Works REALLY well with mages in your group, since you throw up Curse of Elements and pump out those firebolts / immolates / searing pains. Just get a threat meter. CONS: no instant cast corruption. But corruption is for virgins and conflagrate from behind two shields is for chads.
---
**Siphon Life / DS** 21/21/9. Want to farm Dire Maul with no problems, but find SM/DS boring without improved shadowbolt and faster casting immolate/shadowbolt? This is the spec with all the tools you need for soloing bosses (siphon life/ fel stam DS), but you can also get extra shadowbolt damage and make your shadowbolts and immolates ALMOST as fast as normal. Optimal for lying to your raid leader when he asks if you're respecced for MC-- you can pretend you're ds/ruin.
---
Any other weird specs I'm missing?
---
False. Raid damage is a mechanic that becomes more important over time, and as such HP is still a very important stat.
---
Nobody is complaining against Horde players playing PvE servers. Do not try to divert it to something that is not true.
---
That thing is going to last +10 lvs, if I find it relatively cheap I will. I dont lack in gold.
---
Or join an adult guild? Not every guild is some poopsock tryhard nerdfest trying to bleeding-edge a 15 year old elf sim.
---
Better on a warrior... :p
---
Skeram could use more people.
---
Aight.
---
Herod
---
Just hit 60 on my first toon in wow ever. As a tank. I've been noticing that literally almost every dungeon unless I'm levels above it has been a pain for me to keep aggro. I am now realizing that it's not my fault. I'm tab sundering, I'm demoralizing, battle shouting. Constantly finding myself with zero rage and mobs everywhere. I'm just writing this to show my appreciate for this article. People need to lay off going crazy and aoe and let the tank do his job.
---
I think the issues is and always will be that people are not always thinking clearly, a lot of times through salt or other similar emotions. So what happens is people say things during that highly passionate moment and it all gets vented somewhere for me earlier it was my server discord and boy was I salty on my 20th camped death. 
---
What I am trying to say is that this sub and all aspects of the game are catering to the market and unfortunately the market is full of people who are over reacting to a situation. 
---
It happens so much that I have seen games get destroyed due to the player base wanting changes to be made due to issues that armrest frustrating them they find a solutions and all of a sudden it is implemented because of the bandwagon and bam it has a detrimental effect on the game.
---
I think the reason for this is that people don’t think about the consequences of anything a wow classic example being unbalanced servers and how due to the dominating factions just going balls deep into their domination of the server it’s makes things worse so it becomes a cycle of less people to PvP against the more deaths for those that remain, so more leave which means less people to kill which mean those remaining are killed more often.... you get the point in that the consequence of making the other faction suffer so much is it gets harder to find meaningful PvP. 
---
The community on here have shunned away  content creators for self promoting but as a result they now don’t get any content that is enjoyable or informative because of it. Sometimes it  is better to just let people be and do their thing and if other like it then the upvotes will help solve the issue. If complaints about phase two keep getting to the top it is because it is resonating with enough people to put it there but there should be a degree of control from the sub a whole to not just upvote stuff because they are saying what you want to hear and upvote good content instead.
---
Already leveled three 60's, so yep!
---
Yeah, I'll give you that. It does feel like blowing away money sometimes.
---
Oh I see what you mean. Good shit to know in case I ever make a sham. Maybe they were going by tournament rules lol
---
Is there a reason you are unable to fully type out words, capitalize, and use punctuation?
---
Wow nice!
---
On Skeram and it’s solid.
---
Sounds like you've just heard a bunch of "ret is a meme" and never played classic or pservers, palies in premades will stomp BGs. Its actually a pretty non controversial statement.
---
Okay so I may have ranted on a bit 😂
---
I'd be sympathetic, but this guy seems like a hyper toxic, tryhard, douche.
---
Are you horde on heartseeker? Horde on my server, skeram, have a darn near clear path to BRM with no resistance from ally because the disparity between the two factions is so high.
---
[removed]
---
This is just false, ravager is better than whirlwind axe.
---
Those ones don't drop elemental fire. You need to be in Arathi or UnGoro.
---
Probably a fight that punishes melee
---
Never doubtes your math. It is correct, however the numbers demonstrated doesnt say anything.
---
Would you be very kind and tell me the names of the 10 pvp alliancw dominated servers.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I think you've just said the real reason your guild doesn't have two raid groups.
---
You don't trust anyone else to run it and you don't have the dedication to create an alt to run it yourself.
---
And as a result, anyone who doesn't get into raid group 1, misses out on being part of your guild for the week.
---
No wonder they then join the guilds whose PUGs they join instead.
---
Winters chill you mean?
---
Shaman isnt suboptimal. Lots of warlocks and rogues is suboptimal. Having multiple hunters and druids is suboptimal 
---
Enh shamans are just plain bad.
---
And I'm not telling you that you aren't allowed to play badly but somewhere somehow "nightfall shaman" became a meme and now people think they are a reasonable addition to a raid when they do significantly less of anything.
---
I’m on skeram. But I seem to always see alliance death squads but I see only little groups of horde here and there
---
Most of the posts are complaining about horde in general.  It's a joke dude.
---
Pre totemming is kinda scummy but in the rogue case it just waste time as he doesn't wolf form so the rogue just take cares. Way to waste seconds of the duel.
---
I suppose the helmet thing with lightning shield make sense, I doubt it works that way tho.
---
Yeah I do this quest on every character, generally at high 40's or low 50's. Head to Azshara and do the level 46 quests which are green but quick/easy/good XP, head up north to nab the quests there while I grab the runes on the way (there's also an alliance quest to get an item from inside the ruins while you're there). Sure the run to hand it in is a little bit long but I'm not sure why anybody would get killed.. long as you avoid the camp of elite dragonkin it's fine.
---
It probably helps that I *always* level in Ashenvale because I absolutely love the zone, and make a point of ducking over to Azshara and nabbing the flight point while I'm there.
---
But yeah, no idea why the hate for Azshara. Wish there were a couple more quests but at the same time it's such a peaceful zone as almost nobody is ever there.
---
lmao except it was more like a couple of hours before honor was released, there were already groups of people gathering and fighting to get ready
---
That's not how the Honor system works. You're only being compared to your own faction on your own server. Queues could be 2 hours long it wouldn't matter. The people who play 18+ hours a day will still be ahead because they'll be winning every single BG while maximizing graveyard farming. In between queues, they'll still be roaming for kills in the World.
---
My concern with this approach is:
---
a) It is highly intrusive to the mechanics of the game to the point that combat itself is impacted whereas affecting xp rates is an indirect incentive, non-intrusive to player encounters while still encouraging a desirable result.
---
b) It actually may end up being a perverse incentive. Minority faction members are then incentivized to terrorize individual majority faction members with their superior combat abilities, further degrading the state of world PvP
---
What?
---
I wouldn't put anything past the new Blizzard Communist Party.
---
Heh here I am meanwhile thinking that Creative Assembly has totally dropped the ball.
---
Felt the same way until someone explained that 2h warriors live or die by their crits and you're not supposed to use Heroic strike as your main source of damage. 
---
Respec'd 5 points in cruelty and improved overpower and deep wounds, focused on using sunder armor as my main ability with rend and demoralizing shout after a charge. 
---
Now my focus is trying to do as many attacks (sunder armor, rend, hamstring) as possible to proc overpower and it's fat crits. 
---
I played for a while with sword and board and that was fun too. 
---
I remembered reading an article about dual wielding and how the developers had to balance it with sword/board and two-handers. I think the logic was 2h was 20% more damage than sword/board so you'll finish fights quicker but you'll take more damage so you'll spend more time out of combat eating and bandaging, so it kind of balances out.
---
They needed to do the same sort of improvement with dual wielding so they upped the miss rate and lowered the damage of the offhand until it was about 20% more damage than sword and board.
---
I personally enjoyed playing sword/board for a time, it was a little slower but I could take more mobs which was fun and in some places necessary, and shield block is nice to stop those pesky casters.   
---
Hope things get better
---
Whirlwind axe is lvl 30, and you're using it at lvl 44, there's part of your problem right there...lol
---
I'm told my server (Deviant Delight) is roughly 60/40 in favor of the alliance.  
---
Yet the horde are the ones everywhere camping every level 45+ flight point in raids of 6+ members and I see little to no level 60s on the alliance side.  
---
This is because I'm told thenhorde raid progression is horrible, and yet I don't see that many actual raiding guilds on the alliance. I think there's only like 4 or 5 guilds that don't have to put for than 50% of their raid.
---
&gt;You're being very narrow-minded. People are quitting in droves because of the current state of the game and all you have to respond with is basically "if you're not a hardcore pvper who wants to pvp all the time, gtfo."
---
This hasn't been anything remotely close to my point, but you are trying to push this narrative so hard to prove a point.
---
&gt;Do you want the game to die? Because that's whats going to happen. Blizzard needs to implement a solution that prevents alliance from quitting.
---
Ah thank you, another person saying WoW will die.
---
I remember people saying the exact same thing about a month from launch.
---
Then when MC was on farm.
---
Then when DM was released.
---
And I'm sure they'll keep crying that WoW is dying when people are out there actually having fun.
---
Ban low effort memes. Unfortunately this probably includes baby yeed memes.
---
Ahh yes Nefarian’s Lair.
---
Noice
---
Even being lvl 35 in just leveling gear wont help against a twink, youre not helping yourself. It is not hard for me to assume you do gank 30s since you put lvl 30-45 in your post.
---
Just enjoy the ride lol
---
Wut
---
None of your "pros" have anyrhing to do with fury prot (except for the "be a snowflake who ignores meta because what do they know anyways" I guess).
---
Reasons to not level fury prot:
---
1. You have no hit rating
---
2. You have no crit rating
---
3. Your dps arent parsing top 100 in the world causing you threat issues.
---
4. You have no hit rating
---
5. Arms does what 2h Fury does but better
---
6. You have no hit rating
---
Let's do it like they do on the discovery channel
---
Yea this is a major issue. Half the problem is that you dont even have time to run because by the time you see the gank squad coming for you, theyre already on top of you.
---
You really only need a tank spec for raids. I tank every 60s ini as fury. Tactical mastery is a godsend in 5 mans. Dearly missed as fury prot.
---
Once a deathsquad finished off the mob before killing me so I got quest credit.  Pretty nice!
---
I have 5 hunters:
---
1. 60 Mm/BM Orc Hunter.
---
2. 60 Survival/BM NE hunter.
---
3. x2 30 (multibox) NE BM/MM Hunters. I got bored with these and moved onto #4.
---
4. 47 NE Survival/MM Hunter (better server than #2).
---
I, as a level 18 rogue, killed a notorious level 60 horde in one of the top guilds that is known for ganking alliance on a server that is like 80% horde 20% alliance
---
PVE servers BG just as much as PVP servers...
---
Such is the life of the enchanter.
---
how?  you can't even see them.
---
you sound like one of the punks that ive ganked. EZ. See u out there scrub
---
Okay....?
---
I actually like the memes though
---
Statistically speaking, he did get a 50% drop rate for this item.
---
Braindead horde ? But that braindead alliance that camps lights hope chapel as soon as you get out of FM 24/7 is fine huh? Another special needs ally snowflake that think alliance is saint.
---
In sunken temple I pulled a patrol by accident, ran up 1 flight of stairs and they were like "nah". Didn't know it was so easy
---
Yeah, I just can't see what type of person, other than someone clearly just trying to get a rise out of others for some weird emotional gratification of "trolling", would suggest the pvp situation on imbalanced servers is okay. 
---
after looking at both sides of the imbalance, while it is less frustrating to be on the over populated side, it still completely lacks any sentience of world pvp as it existed in Vanilla. 
---
I realize that the issue stems from Blizz opening up server population totals to diver ques, which I really can't argue with, as I believed it was a good decision at the time to.
---
It is tough to recreate the vanilla experience with the gaming atmosphere of today, no doubt.
---
The only option or bandaid for this IMO is to reintroduce sharding and let people on the over populated side have a priority of finding the opposing faction, after that, make it a que time for them to shard to the less populated factions side the longer they stay on, something to that affect, atleast may be a 1 to 2-3 ratio max between factions, rather than 1 to 4-5.
---
I still have about 23 days on my current sub, I'm looking forward to BG's coming out and am having better hopes the pvp madness will be sorted out quite a bit more in the coming weeks.
---
If you think spending 90% of the time being dead and trying to corpse-run to be able to do any type of PVE content is fun, congratulations, you are the 1%. For the other 99%, this sucks and almost EVERYONE agrees with me. I've yet to find anyone (besides maybe you) that enjoys being on the tail end of a factional imbalance for world pvp. Spending an hour just GETTING to a dungeon is NOT fun.
---
Basically all your reasons book down to, I’m already invested here. The real question was, would you have played on PvE instead of PvP knowing what you know now?
---
Make a daily thread for complaining so that we can use the rest of the sub for discussion.
---
Are there still queues there at all hours?
---
Nah it sounds like you do.
---
(a) And whines about this being unfair occour on the expected schedule.
---
(b) if so, and the factions go back into balance, then the buffs go away
---
All DPS warriors are your offtanks. Just let them take aggro from a mob and don't taunt it off them. They're wearing plate, they pulled aggro, they chose to tank it.
---
Healers always get your taunt, then clothy caster dps, then leather wearers, mail wearers and finally, at the end, basically never get a taunt, the dps warrior. 
---
Set your own pace and follow it, If dps don't like the way you're tanking, they can leave and find a new group. Sounds like you like the controlled and super smooth LoS pull and tank. I do too, it's  quicker if mana is managed correctly. But there are definitely people out there that just like to go balls to the wall on everything. 
---
As a tank I ignore those people, let them pull aggro and die, then taunt their mob off the healer and go back to proper tanking and spanking. They stop insta AoEing and pulling threat as soon as you've fired off your one shot, once they have died 2-3 times. Either that or they leave. win/win for you
---
Lol get rekt nerd
---
B-but the enhancement part Is cuz they enhance their weapons with the elements to bash their foes :(
---
What are the bottons above your poison brewing one?
---
Those people are seriously retarded, they don’t get that there are alliance ganking raids too or are just horde players allowed to get ganked?
---
“Always be giving out Golden Pearls”
---
That’s a straight up fucking lie. 
---
They have a *slight chance* to give you a Golden Pearl from the clams they drop ~60% of the time.
---
I killed over 1,500 Naga on those beaches trying to get 4 Golden Pearls for my Truefaith Vestments. Got loads of Black, Iridescent and Lustrous Pearls but guess what? Not a single Golden Pearl dropped. 
---
Maybe I’m just really unlucky but to say that they are “always dropping” is nonsense.
---
What info is stored in the cache tho? Will U lose macros or add-on info for things like auctioneer?
---
There is no way that is correct. There is no way fairbanks is 30/70 A/H. Alliance dominates almost every 50+ zone besides BRM.
---
The first part of the -10 roll sounds pretty good but the second part is dumb. Obviously you want the piece of gear if you even /roll. My guilds loot rules is you can only get 1 piece of gear but that resets at majordomo. So if you win a piece of gear before majordomo you can roll on another piece at domo or after.
---
Right? WoW was the original easy-mode carebear PvE MMO. Shit is super easy with basic listening and character movement skills.
---
Not immediately dispelling frost nova would be a big mistake. Frost mages gain 50% crit vs a frozen target and they crit hard from talents. You're going to be eating a ton of damage if you sit in a nova.
---
Doesn't matter. If one faction has the majority, they'll lose all integrity. I'm on an alliance dominated server. It's just a faction swap, otherwise it's exactly the same.
---
And after 16 runs, my robes has yet to drop.
---
Destruction is fine.  You can actually do really well with this build if you keep good quality food on you (recommend cooking). And 2 stacks of the best bandages you can use.  You can down 3-4 mobs, bandage, kill 3-4 more mobs, eat after lifetap, kill 3-4 more mobs, bandage... rinse and repeat......  this has worked extremely well for me.  Also, my build is going to be geared more towards pvp and plan on doing little raiding.  Maybe dip my toes in MC and Ony but not much more...
---
Hmm. Well that's a very interesting read. Even though you do make yourself sound like a not-so-pleasant person, the honesty in your post was just invigorating. And I found myself relating to much of what you are saying. 
---
Though I am always super happy and outgoing and helpful to people in the game, it really does take a toll on me. It's like you said- "It's really not enjoyable for me to become involved in the expectations of other people." I do feel that way sometimes. 
---
So again, I appreciate your insight. Even if it may not be the most popular kind of opinion, it gave me some perspective and made me think a little harder about what I expect to give and take with this game. Hmm.
---
do not do this to yourself, trust me. You can tank all dungeons up to 60 as arms or fury.
---
why are all the alliance red to him , are they not like blue in that zone?
---
Cat is superior to wolf despite common belief. The dps gained from using cat outweighs the furious howl buff. That is if you (and your raid) is good enough to actually keep it dpsing
---
hmm, I think i will just sell it for now
---
Settle down. This was a tongue in cheek comment. 
---
I got 4 killing them for about 4 to 5 hours.
---
I would assume by going oom every pull..
---
Or both are bad but yeah this game will die if these things don’t change. If game play isn’t very different after BG’s come out in just going to cancel my sub. I have other games I can spend my money on.
---
How do I sound like one the people youve ganked when you cant even communicate with them lul. Imagine getting mad about pvp happening on a pvp server when youre twinking haha.
---
And then you make your own.
---
You're crazy mate, any server that spans multiple time zones (europe, oceana) are gonna have multiple guilds with two MC raids each. Felstriker is the smallest Aussie server and all 5 of the big horde guilds have a second 'late raid' MC going on.
---
What do you want instead? If they ban memes and PvP whining it'll just be a blank feed
---
Nope buy it and farm some gold
---
They said that it will be in the first quarter of 2020, thats jan-march. Early 2020 doesn't mean january, feb and march could both be considered early in the year.
---
Anyways no point argueing, it will be out when its out.
---
It’s a community. When a person cheats they effect the whole community. It’s really selfish. I’m not sitting here calling this a life and death issue, but this shit isn’t pretend. You can’t manifest 10k black lotuses into your inventory. Fuck off with that weak condescending shit. 
---
Didn’t realize this community was so full of bot apologists. Game communities generally hate people who come in and ruin their economies for a quick buck. Casual ezmode mmo bitches, I say.
---
Some precomputed stuff. I can imagine it would help on HDD because that stuff is faster to compute again than read from disk, but on SSD you shouldn't be experiencing this.
---
No, addon settings are in WTF folder.
---
My two favorite classes to level are hunter and Druid. Druid leveling is probably the most diverse because as you learn your forms they dominate your playstyle until you learn the next one. So you start as a balance staff-basher, then you’re mostly a bear for ten levels, then a seal, then a lynx (or horned lion), then you get a travel form at level 40 that’s instant cast and almost as fast as a mount (140% vs 160%).
---
Add in Feline Swiftness at level 20 for a 15/30% speed boost by 21 and Druid leveling is a ton of fun.
---
This is how I used to do it when RAF first came out. Your XP bar looked like it was animated.
---
OB *is* legit. But come join Horde. Ally already have it easy with their majority... Thinking they're all cool...
---
some like it hard and fast , some like it soft and slow
---
You can at least just go in the other direction.
---
AV was tested in the beta and there was no lotus, so I don't think we will
---
I main tank so I have no use for that.

Well genius, please explain how 1.15 hrs = one hour and 15 minutes. I will delete my account if you successfully can
---
The majority of new players rolling on my server are PvP refugees.
---
Either extreme measures get taken, or ganking servers will continue to see their issues get worse.
---
Westfall is alliance territory.
---
It's reddit, what did you expect?

Especially if those people are shaman / priests.

Leveling is my favorite! I'm an old school RPGer, I like questing and leveling. Maybe the players that drive me nuts will leave.....

Also, just looked, dont know what you mean by bwl launching in january in vanilla, it went live in july 2005.

It's part of the DejaStats addon which has multiple features.

"**useless memes**" -criticism of someone who's butthurt. when are memes supposed to be fucking useful lol.
---
Wow. This is, legitimately my favorite quest in the game... different strokes I guess.
---
Are you running OOM? Then yes.  That's what this thread is about.  Are you doing fine and not wasting our time drinking or wiping because you blow mana out your ass?  Do whatever. The dungeons are easy as hell.

Didn't work for me, tried to get a quest ring back.

&gt;And here's the way I see it: if blizzard gave the option for PVP to transfer to PVE, PVP servers wouldn't exist anymore because everyone would transfer
---
And this is exactly why we won't agree, you have this weird mentality that PvP breaks PvP servers when it's the only reason that some people play. If PvP didn't exist, a lot of people wouldn't even play WoW because the PvE content is so trivial.  
---
The issue is that people come to PvP servers with a misguided sense of what to expect, then are outraged when they realize they wanted the PvE experience.
---
&gt;If people had any idea how bad this was going to be, including myself, I would never have rolled PVP. 
---
This is exactly what I thought it would be, and I absolutely love it. I can't go anywhere without someone trying to kill me, or trying to kill someone else. .
---
It feels like World of WARcraft. The period between Honor and Battlegrounds is what I looked forward to the most, I knew that this would cause PvP on a global scale for weeks until Battlegrounds were released. I'm fully expecting a lot of this action to die down when Battlegrounds are released, just like how the SS/TM slaughter died down after BG's came out in Vanilla.  
---
&gt;If you had the foresight to see how big of a sh*tshow this was going to become, congratulations. Again, you're part of the 1%. The other 99% just want to be able to play the game without being dead a HUGE percentage of the time they play.
---
Once again, another exaggeration.
---
This stuff was known well before and there are plenty of threads that talk about it. You see people predicting the camping the ganking outside instances, and everything else in between, the issues with imbalanced servers and FP camping, the lack of layering causing clusterfucks. 
---
All of this stuff was known well in advance and to say that it's part of the 1% just proves your ignorance and willingness to prove a point by using extreme examples rather than actual evidence to support your claim.
---
Note that none of you naysaying pussies have a THING to say about the several talking points I posted here. You’d rather try to silence the discussion so you can keep the bots running for your own benefit. 
---
Just go fuck off somewhere else and suck Chinese bot cock in silence.
---
Melee hunters lmao.
---
No one with a brain thought MC will be hard
---
Thats kind of ok, but what I mean is just opening trade and not saying anything. You will save me the most time if you dont bother me at all, if we're talking about this.
---
Do you have the video? I want to peer into the mind of the monster who made this.
---
Back in the day Fiery Weapon seemed to be pretty popular, but there’s probably better min/max enchants than that.
---
&gt;All they would have to do is make it so anyone gray to you would have to do an additional flag
---
so...make PvP servers PvE servers? what a novel and completely not lazy idea.
---
these aren't "fixes," they are changes. the entire point of the game is two factions at war. if that's not your cup of tea there are PvE servers for you to play on. making every server a PvE server isn't a solution to anything. the entire risk of being vulnerable out in a dangerous world is completely removed.
---
the "fix" is to organize some friends for payback after you get ganked, instead of organizing a petition on the forums to change the game.
---
Wolf because if you are positioned right you give that buff to 5 dps and on bosses that you can't sent you pet in it's still more dps.
---
Horde queue times are gonna be atrocious. I feel real bad for Heartseeker Horde who get to be both the minority faction and still get fucked over by the Horde swarms on the major servers.
---
Actually closer to 1400 expected runs, but yeah long ass time.
---
Yeah it’s wild...
---
HonorSpy developer admited that for each player killed more than 500 chat messages are broadcasted to all honorspy players. 
---
Assuming a populated server with 2500 players using the addon, the chat server must deliver 500x2500 = 1.25 million extra messages per kill, 100 dead players  =&gt; 125 million extra messages to deliver in a couple of minutes. 
---
It seems chat server can handle this extra data but It's throttling the messages, because you cannot flood the players bandwidth,for example if 100 players die in the server and you are using honorspy,  you are going to receive 50000 extra messages.
---
bwl isn't as hard as you think it is.
---
I agree with you on AQ40 and definitely naxx40, but BWL? nah.
---
Snapshotting.
---
whats the point ?
---
u can understand what i mean with basic english knowledge
---
As in the same time elapsed from bg's to BWL.
---
Obviously BWL didn't release in january 2020...?
---
And then you spent 1-2 hrs looking for a tank, just for the group to fall apart at the end because you cant find a damn tank.
---
If you arent a tank or healer and dont deal aoe damage, making/finding a group is a nightmare.
---
The community you talk about never existed on high pop servers...
---
So I'm a level 60 gnome. And I kinda hate the gnome racial mounts. I had the plan to farm Darn rep and get a frostsaber for my epic mount. I'm currently on path to afford an epic mount with 500g banked so far.
---
I was wondering, How difficult is it to farm Darn rep? Has anyone else done it and how long did it take you? What was the best path to doing it? Is it something achievable in a reasonable amount of time? What methods would be best to do so? I can see you can hand in runecloth, Does anyone have the numbers of required cloth? Any information would be great!
---
I can confirm that the sword gives 8% run speed only and not mount speed.   
---
Pretty sure it can't stack either as stated by NostalgiaSchmaltz.
---
In the classic tradition of vanilla...."Can I have ur stuff?"
---
6 hours/week and clearing MC 7 weeks in. You hit level cap in 42 hours? That's impressive.
---
You can leave and rejoin the bg? Wouldn't you get flagged as a deserter?
---
you should just all make summoning alts and stash them hidden inside the quary
---
Yes but this would be a good 15-16 hours later. After sleeping for the night and going to school.
---
Incendius is pretty decent
---
Anathema-US; Fission-anathema, &lt;Fusion&gt;. 200 characters, 135 accounts. MC in under 2hours currently have both bindings, and an Eye (small server so bars/ingots are difficult to come by.) Have a 2nd raid group of maybe 40% alts and the rest just newer players or friends and family.
---
Interesting! Does Not explain the lack of partial resists from the Sea Elementals melee attacks though, but with such a small sample size that might have just been bad luck,
---
Sulfuras is like 40/60 so we could use the alliance bodies
---
Idk what you want me to say. Better yet, tell me what blizzard can do to solve the problem?
---
People already aren't getting HK's for killing lowbies so I highly doubt that they're going to do anything more than leave it as it is. Either reroll on a new server, or buck up. Fight or die. If you're not having fun, unsub. If you don't wanna unsub, reroll. 
---
If you don't want to reroll or unsub, guess you're going to subject yourself to a bad time, which is unhealthy. 
---
According to wowclassicrealmpop.com, there's 52% horde and 48% Alliance overall, which isn't bad. I'm sure there are servers where hordies are getting bodied constantly by allies. 
---
Reddit has small-brains.
---
The thing people never talk about when this bring this point up, is that you don't need to. You could go into BWL without optimizing and still clear the content with average players. You don't need to min-max every aspect of classic game play to be successful. The raid content is so easy, I'm not sure why people even bother.
---
What's unfair about this? Everyone gets an equal chance. The part where they make you feel bad for winning again sucks ofc, they should make up their mind about it, but it doesn't make it unfair.
---
Since you're doing full guild you could ofc consider a council/point system that rewards dedication over blind RNG, if that's what you mean by fair.
---
The melee attacks almost certainly don't use spell resist mechanics.
---
Now that I've hit 60 and got my epic mount, what do I do with my level 40 mount? Can't sell it and it's taking up space in my bank. Is there any reason not to destroy it? Only thing I can think of is if I ever wanted to help out a lower level player with some quests or something but not sure if I'd ever do that.
---
Oh wow! Can't wait for them!
---
Thanks man. Since it's hard to get into dungeons it seems for a rogue. I'm just gonna quest my hard heart. Hope I don't get ganked to hard haha.
---
I mean there's elves, dwarves and fucking high pitched midgets too. The majority of which are steeped in fantasy lore from the likes of DnD, etc.
---
I wouldn't say the horde and ally is completely different, but the zerg melee strat works best on horde and zerg caster best on ally. 
---
Warlock is there for curse yeah, that one debuff will be massive.
---
As for the healer situation, I don't know. I suspect the shamans will have plenty of ability to do some dps, and generally melee do outperform casters heavily in this phase(but then again how strong is the shatter stuff?) it's really hard to tell. Go test it :D
---
What on earth would BWL releasing in january 2005 have to do with classic?
---
&gt;This isnt vanilla, there is 0 indication they will follow vanilla time frames or release periods.
---
... except they already have? Or do you **actually** believe that the time between bg's and BWL is going to be **LONGER** in classic than it was in Vanilla?
---
Hahahahahahaha good one.
---
Being able to use a new level of water or food for fast recovery while grinding.  Now, the easiest water to get is level 45 and sucks.  It's like drinking Khadghars bathwater...
---
I don't.
---
But I wish they were smarter about removing layers. We should still have layers right now. The game is unplayable. Every decent farming spot in the world has people there at all hours of the day.
---
Second account is still incredibly useful.
---
&gt; people can move if the large servers don't suit them
---
By move you mean create a new character and lose all previous progress right?
---
Just a kid, let him do his thing
---
I did play pvp server vanilla, but after bgs were already implemented.  I never got camped until late game and world pvp was rare until the mid 30s.  If the massive camping remains in the coming weeks it is unlikely I will continue playing.  I have no desire to start over with a new character on another server and while character transfer is a solution, I really like my guild and finding another good one would be a pain.  For some people yes, but based on guild feedback I feel as if it is pretty evenly split.  I would like to note I am only on a pvp server because the group I started playing the game with chose it.  I wanted pve and of course all of those people long since quit on me.
---
Making it so you cant gank someone 8+ levels under you isnt making the game PvE. You should probably do a self check if that's what you require to "PvP".
---
Both have fixed proc ratio's.  Crusader averages 2 procs per minute, fixed. Lifestealing averages 6 procs per minute, fixed. (This was taken from the post popular twink post ever)
---
Again unless your fights are sustained for a long time which as a twink, they dont last more then a few seconds, you will benefit more from lifestealing. Rogues are suppost to kill fast and vanish and repeat, not be in long battles. 
---
Now you are correct. In the rare time that you are in a 2v1 situation, and crusader procs, it will be better.
---
I enjoyed world PvP from wrath onward. I didn’t know it was so ass.
---
Yes, that is why the rolling system is in place: you make a party, and whoever gets lucky, gets the item. Thats how it was intended, and thats how it was in vanilla. There was none of this reserve bs.
---
&gt; have already had to save instance groups by picking up mobs off a dead tank, or healing the tank for the last few hits when the healer went OOM.
---
if you were a real dps class the mobs would've died before stuff went poorly, just saying
---
I would also vote this.
---
No posts with screen shots of chars showing off raid gear 
---
No posts about how your guild finally killed rag 
---
No posts about classic+
---
Oh yeah I hate stormwind where you have to click twice to talk to any NPC...
---
Someone just triggered every bananadin in the world.
---
Also interesting. They do frost damage according to the combat log, but I could see it being an old overlooked thing that they don't count as frost damage despite what the combat log says.
---
You should have your wife's boyfriend tell them to stop bullying you.
---
Maybe Alliance would get farmed less in that area if Faithe, Karma and Trauma guilds wouldn't have made sure to piss of the Horde faction over weeks at BRM.
---
*Sasha Grey of the Alliance has entered the chat*
---
Download the addon threatplates. There’s a customization that’ll point arrows at the targets health to clearly show who you are tab targeting. This will help in those cluttered dungeon moments.
---
I agree that there are ways to change the game for the better, the problem is how do they separate ideas that a good vs bad without ending up where they went or worse? Let's face it, we got a version of Vanilla that's is fine, but it's not vanilla. So there could be ways to make the game better in some ways without drastically changing the experience.
---
Or grind that timbermaw rep for a proper transmute so you don't have to settle for 5g every 2 days.
---
Not really any reason to keep it, it's soul bound so you won't ever be able to do anything with it.
---
I still have mine for nostalgia reasons, but tossing it away is fine.
---
I dunno, I’m pretty sure we beat the EU on that one, since a twink is the “bottom” in gay lingo. I remember having to make sure safe search was enabled back in the day when searching “wow twinking” om Google.
---
Sounds more like you're on a neutered server
---
Its most likely 60-70% will not continue playing if massive camping remains :/
---
reminds me of a friend of mine who accidentally bought the water to undeath recipe for 200g because he wasn't paying attention, and somehow he managed to sell it again for 200g to some other poor guy
---
1 yes
---
2 no, no
---
3 no
---
4 I’m in my 30s with a career now, 4 hours to get into brm just won’t do. I would consider pve but the group I started with is on pvp. I joined knowing the risks, have just stepped away for now. 
---
5 no
---
And then everyone stood up and clapped.
---
Because sinister strike x10 is moronic and boring inmho and I like daggers oneshoting horde pest in my 70 - 30 pop realm, also I use to lv with a friend warr new to the game but he gets some aggro.Also if mobs get their hp gone in 1 ambush theres no need to worry about that.
---
This is good but spawns are so low that if 2 other people are doing it your screwed. I get about 6 nodes per hour in off hours but maybe 2 to 3 otherwise.
---
I came so close to doing the same thing, I let out a "NO!" seconds before clicking as I noticed
---
Alliance PvPers will probably get instant battlegrounds. And instant battlegrounds are better honor than open world ganking.
---
I’m simply stating that “the one way” is to gain threat as a tank. If you can’t and are complaining because others are generating more than you, maybe you should evaluate how you are gaining threat.
---
Wow, ok.. you are all over the place, im just gonna drop it. Have a good day!
---
Agreed largely.
---
After No Nut November.....  https://imgur.com/0NSPLUT.jpg
---
I ain't complaining but
---
1. I played pvp on pservers
---
2. sometimes yeah
---
3. What do you mean by current state? Phase 2 forever? Hell no, but BGs are literally in 8 days, it's fine. I would jump to a new pserver though since the gameplay quality is IMO better there. Or at least it fits me the best, maybe because I'm used to it
---
4. I would never play a pve server
---
5. most definitely, raids are boring.
---
bad logic, those roaming gank squads are out there picking them all up lmao.
---
&gt; we are getting 1.12 AV. They won’t last nearly as long.
---
The LBRS Wolf is the best option for raiding according to me, it gives  45-57 dmg to all in party(raid group). With trueshot aura, this is Insane for any melee group, put 1 shaman, 1 feral(if possible), 1 hunter and 1-3 warrior/rogue/or ANOTHER hunter(if there is no feral) and this group will outdps any other.
---
I have both Broken Tooth and LBRS Wolf, and for The raid and progress the Wolf is much better, for PvP Broken tooth(or if you want more dps for yourself, less for raidgroup) , for example you can respecc the Pets talents to exactly fit the raid, i have maxed Fire resistance and Lvl 10 stamina(and very little armor since he never takes direct dmg) for MC/Rag, basicly my pet always survives the whole Rag fight, i send him with aspect of the beast close to melee group, and put him on stay, you should have the pet close to you, and yourself close to the melee group, that way both you and the group benefit from it. Getting 45-57 Every 9 secounds to 4-5 people, is much more important that your pets max 1k damage during a fight, that is if the pet even survives a full fight. 
---
Also you can rightclick the Howl skill, remove growl(dont even skill Bite in pet talents) and he the pet will always use it when he has 60 focus, WITHOUT you manually using the skill. 
---
These are my 2 cents / Played hunter vanilla, tbc, wotlk and now classic 💪🏼
---
They got flagged for PvP because they attacked the sheep.
---
lol
---
mage here sir. thank you! I will buy it~ 
---
got any good tips for mage farming? I know ZF is one, but Id love to hear other suggestions
---
Exactly. They arnt taking my herbs. They are stopping people from herbing though. Making herb prices increase. Why is this a hard concept?
---
&gt; the stigma of being on PVE
---
The only ones who see being on a PvE realm as having a "stigma" about it are those very people everyone's complaining about. Quite frankly if anyone unironically spoke to me about stigma I would just laugh and laugh. Some people are super serious about their video games.
---
No, free transfers are open.
---
In retail there are literally Horde vs Horde battles. "Mercenary mode"
---
It's the same as your seals, some aspects are treated like a spell (damage type), others as a melee attack (hit/crit table).
---
Depends on your server.
---
Elemental pools out in Bay of Storms Azshara can be fished for essence of water, but they require a lot of swimming/are often camped/are random as hell.
---
Tanaris coast pools can be fished for a variety of fish but also mythril trunks giving you the mats for runecloth bags and black mageweave boots to DE.  That or you can sell the mats.
---
Winterspring has these nice hotsprings that can be fished for nightfin tuna at night.
---
How worthwhile such thing are depends on the player and server.
---
I'm a bit skeptical of that. I started out on Whisperwind (a medium pop PvE server) for the first couple of years after launch and finding groups there was significantly harder than on Wildhammer (a medium pop PvP server).  Even if 75% queue regularly, that's still enough of a difference than horde will be looking at longer queues.  I'm hoping I'm wrong, because if I'm not, there still will be gank squads roaming between Bags.
---
you've already admitted to being bad tho so I mean you need it but self awareness is difficult
---
WW has some stats on it big deal.
---
Same, always debating who to sheep in a 2 v 1 let me know if you come across something.
---
Nice new vid u made 1 year ago
---
Last I heard it's a slim majority.  Something like 55/45 split or a 60/40 split.
---
XARYU IS THE MAN FOR THIS
---
Or, you know, just bag the 1000 honor or so you get from winning and queue for another one where you win again.
---
if you figure in the stats WW gives its probably a hair better but like you said not enough to justify doing the quest.
---
Crowd punmlers are basically the druid soul shard.
---
ZF is a great start, about 50g per hour. More if you start boosting players but it is more difficult. 
---
Alternatively if you have herbalism(or herbalism fits for you), then DME lashers + satyrs, here's a guide on that one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnWSl-PJT0Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnWSl-PJT0Q)

Gear for healing, despite viability as a raid tank, it’s extremely difficult to convince a guild or pug raid to accept a feral tank in a raid
---
His argument is that he doesn't need it, in this content the guild isn't wiping because he has a slightly worse ring.
---
What are y’all considering pretoteming? Dropping totems in an active duel before the rogue gets his opener? Cause I’d absolutely do that. In real PvP if I’m expecting a rogue to pop me which happens all the time I will always throw a totem or two out. 
---
This is definitely an odd new generation where throwing down totems while a rogue takes 45 minutes to open = scummy (which also exposes you to sap) but popping every engineering consumable in the observable universe is totally normal.
---
You wrote a lot, but it's vague, imprecise, and don't discuss anything but your own assumptions about what you thought the player base was, and what you idealize the player base should be. The player base was this way well before phase 2. You didn't have the ability to notice and you're not going to change it by telling people to behave better and trying to shift the responsibility to the individual. The framework of the game allows this stuff to happen. What we need is better, more thoughtful game design, if players are acting in a way they is going to destroy the game.
---
&gt; I was wondering, How difficult is it to farm Darn rep?
---
It's a lot harder if you start farming at 60, if you started at level 1 you would have done a lot of early level quests that gave you tons of rep.
---
&gt;Has anyone else done it and how long did it take you? 
---
Currently doing it now, I'm about 70% of the way through Revered and sort of losing interest while PvPing or playing my alt.  
---
&gt;What was the best path to doing it?
---
The only real way to get rep at 60 is through Runecloth turnins (you need to do the Wool/Silk/Magewave quests first). It takes a long time, I believe it's something like 450 turnins (450 * 20 = 9,000 runecloth) to get from Revered &gt; Exalted.
---
Quite commonly you'll see people advertising in trade for runecloth stacks, and they usually ask people to CoD them stacks for 1.2g. Meaning that if you outright bought all your runecloth @1.2g it would take 540g just to get from Revered &gt; Exalted.   
---
&gt;Is it something achievable in a reasonable amount of time? 
---
If you have 1500g+, a good supply of runecloth and a large server, you could probably get it done very quickly.
---
My guild beat Rag for the first time yesterday. Up until this point we did not have enough people with quest to douse runes. We cleared it after two wipes.
---
I was playing a rogue it was made pretty clear what I had to do before the fight started.
---
Our offtank walked us over to a spot on ground told us to stack here with all of melee while dpsing him. Then once he channels his ability stop dps run back to this spot where you are safe from knockback.
---
"During phase 2 mages are going to blizzard. When they blizzard they will pull aggro from all the mobs protect the mages by mopping up any stray elementals not caught in the blizzard and be careful because they work like slimes in maradon so don't stand on top of them after they die"
---
That was pretty much explanation I was given we had someone calling out during the fight when he was channeling the knockback using this stratergy as long as paying attention and made sure to stack tightly with other melee was straight forward fight. 
---
I had some basic fire res from my gear and I wore onyxia drakefire amulet for extra res with all the buffs up I had around 80 fire res. Did not take very much dmg for whole fight.
---
The wipes were due to screwup around knockback mechanic and people not recognizing how it worked. Once we started calling out over voice chat fight was smooth.
---
Using these tactics fight was quite smooth. We had a lot of mages in our group I imagine if you lack some mages phase 2 gets very hard to kill elementals using blizzard.
---
Some easy bosses yes, but for example Ragnaros its impossible! I usually send my pet to back of melee group with aspect of the beast, and put him on stay. This with trueshot aura is 😍 and the melee dps will not even know why they suddenly do Insane dps 😂(+100ap from trueshot aura + furious Howl 45-57dmg Every 9 secounds). 
---
This way the pet survives, WITHOUT doing any right click dps, but still has more value than dying After 10 sec's.... Also you basicly do no microing during the fight.
---
I mean you're comparing 1.12 classic to vanilla which wasn't 1.12 for the majority of the time.
---
Fights were harder in vanilla because classes/items were worse, not just the players.
---
That's clearely a troll
---
Thanks. You worded the dishonorable kill idea more clearly but that's my general gist :) Some potential concerns with group PvP and dishonor however, so that's worth considering.
---
I've certainly had the occasional partial resist to SoR, but usually against higher level mobs, so I'm unsure what mechanics play into that. Don't have SoCru so can't speak on that.
---
Better to just get thrash blade at 45.  Bloodrazor is a waste
---
While I don't know the exact numbers, at 60 I was getting around 4g90s for 55+ quests. That's excluding some of the items that I would vendor.
---
You don't need flasks for BWL/AQ/NAXX. The entire perception by the player base is frustrating. Everyone wants to min-max, when the content is all ready incredibly easy. Push the boundaries of what you can do with less.
---
All you need are average players who are committed  to the cause.
---
&gt;If you did play Vanilla did you roll a pvp server?
---
Yup.
---
&gt;Did you get camped in your starting zone as a fresh player by someone from the opposing faction? (1-25) being engaged by a 30+ (answer as well for Vanilla if it applies)
---
Nope because I didn't flag for PvP until I hit contested zones like Ashenvale around level 25~.
---
&gt;Do you feel the game in its current state can sustain your interest/subscription?
---
For now at least.
---
&gt;Finally do you feel the PVP element of your server is the most desirable aspect of the game.
---
The players are the best part of the game, but PvP is a close second.
---
Really? Wow, I didn't know that.
---
Your guild is bad and you should leave immediately. There is no reason to use them in MC.
---
is ZF consistent? I now have the gear to do it I think. I can get 3.7khp and and 6.7k mana with my gear. I'm just afraid of wasting time and dying in that hell hole.
---
Everyone can get a HoJ. Far, far from everyone can get this wep.
---
I'm keeping the painting Todd. It was a gift.
---
Do whatever low level quests you can do first, then...
---
As a non-night elf, you start out at 100/6,000 Friendly reputation with Darnassus. In order to purchase training to ride a mount, you must be Exalted with Darnassus. You need to gain 38,900 reptutation.
---
When you do the 20 runecloth quest "Additional Runecloth", you receive 50 reputation per turnin at level 50. That means you need at most 778 stacks of runecloth (less whatever reputation you have gained from quests).
---
Errrr im sorry did you just say a 19 twink will vanish?? Im starting to think you didnt even read the OP let alone my post

Holy god you all have no sense of humor. I think this fantasy rivalry has actually transcended the constraints of the game.
---
Spell power on gear was basically non existent on release. Items as a whole were just a lot worse. We're playing the "nerfed" version of vanilla, when the devs had 2 more years to come up with shit that actually made a little sense.
---
Wow! Thanks for the quick reply man! That's great information. I think it might just be best that I get my racial mount then and then later move on to it. 
---
Thanks again!
---
If you're a horde rogue the Wailing Caverns quest provides a nice blue sword. I'd caution using dual Cruel Barbs mainly due to the slow speed (2.80), especially if you plan on using Crusader. Since Crusader is a chance on hit effect it's best on weapons with a very fast weapon speed as this gives more chances for the effect to proc. Crusader is a great enchant for the attack power boost and heal especially at level 19. I'd recommend saving for an Assassin Blade or a cheaper dagger to use in your offhand.
---
Even prior to 1.12 I don’t recall using fire resist gear. Our tanks did for sure. But for most of us the only FR gear we had was stuff we were holding onto for other reasons.
---
Mic drop 🎤
---
Thanks man! Great info!
---
It ain’t much but it’s honest work
---
You know what i mean though, up until the honor drop on this sub if someone mentioned PVE they'd get comments calling them a baby or care bare mode or the like. I think a lot of people would see that and be dissuaded.
---
Why use many words when few words do trick
---
Why is your pet taking that much damage on rag? Just go out with melee and you are fine. Specced into FR of course.
---
Or use the barov Bell trinket to tank the mobs.
---
The thing about C'Thun is that it's a very gear forgiving fight. It's 100% about group co-ordination. If people position well, don't chain eye lasers, stay in the stomach for the correct amount of time, immediately stun big eyes/claws in P2 etc. the amount of damage taken and the amount of damage needed in weaken phases with everyone alive is actually quite low.
---
If you're in that kind of guild you should leave. They're bad. They're try hard pretenders who are trying to emulate a form of raiding that doesn't exist in classic because the content is far too easy to justify it.
---
When naxx comes out it will be a difficulty as the first raid tier of a new expansion in retail. ON NORMAL difficulty. IT won't even be equivalent to a heroic raid. Anyone who wants to will be able to clear naxx. Some bosses may prove troublesome, but it won't take them long to get on track once they start gearing up.
---
Only for certain servers though correct?
---
well first of all, 14 attack power is 1 weapon dps, ww axe has 15 str (30 ap) so by dps alone its already higher, you can then calculate how much weapon damage is added by doing 30(ap)/3.6(weapon speed), giving you 8 more weapon damage, meaning that the stats on ravager arent even better. (the axe having strength as opposed to ap is also a bonus for alliance players because of kings)
---
ravager's also level 37 not 35, tho 2 levels at that level aren't rly significant just wanted to clarify that. 
---
i did admit that alliance (no wf) and cleave groups are going to benefit from ravager but it is in no way going to just totally replace ww axe. not every group you get will be cleave (and any pull with like less than 5-6 mobs will always benefit ww axe) and ww is 100x better for solo/pvp. in other words, ww is better in almost every situation, is available 7 levels earlier, and even in the situations where ravager is better its close, so is 10000000000000% worth getting it at 30
---
I haven't been complaining (and I've tried to flame complainers when I've seen them) but i do play on a pvp server now and did back then  
---
 
---
1. If you did play Vanilla did you roll a pvp server?
---
I did, as mentioned above
---
2. Did you get camped in your starting zone as a fresh player by someone from the opposing faction? (1-25) being engaged by a 30+ (answer as well for Vanilla if it applies)
---
My main has been 60 for well over a month now so "meh" but I have alts, a 25 and a 35, haven't been camped on either but I do get ganked on occasion (questing in TM ftl, but undead gonna undead). It's no worse now than it was then
---
1. Do you feel the game in its current state can sustain your interest/subscription?
---
Yep, I love classic, it's the game i played back in the day. 
---
1. If no, why? Would you consider PVE as an alternative (whether through alt's or transfer)  
---
You're asking this question to confirm your opinion. 
---
1. Finally do you feel the PVP element of your server is the most desirable aspect of the game.
---
Lol Do I think the pvp aspect of the pvp server that i rolled on to pvp is desirable to the game I'm playing. Yes, you should have rolled a pve server. 
---
6\*\*\*\* If you play on a RP-PVP server do you feel that your pvp experience is much like the norm of other PVP servers?
---
I'm not delusional so i didn't roll an RP server.
---
ZF is super consistent
---
The argument of the fights last to short for crusader also makes no sense, if the fights are so short then life stealing would have little to no affect on the fight besides maybe one leech, however if crusader procs, you gain amd instant bulk heal as well as a 15 sec to benefit you, in at least 2 more fights seeing as they "dont last to long"
---
&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/
---
Welp, sure wish I read and listened to Nostradamus months ago.
---
Great question! Now I also wanna know heh.
---
Do you actually need to be attuned? Can't you just walk in through UBRS? I thought attunement was only for the teleporter stone.
---
I currently use "Mark Of Resolution" &amp; "Mark Of Tyranny" which seem much better for tanking in my opinion.
---
Anyone know of 59 Ret Pally Twink guides? I cant find anything Classic related for the twink gear nowadays :(
---
Do you have a source on thunderfury not being optimal? I'm browsing pserver logs and every top clear has it on their tanks.
---
It is my patented "I know how much damage these mobs do and I have a way to heal low amounts without losing any mana due to regenerations" tactic.
---
I don't have time to watch any twitch loser okay videogames let alone asmongold, but I do know that you're a fucking faggot idiot.
---
The opposing faction in a PvP realm is killing us , i shall go and complain about it , how PVP on our PVP realm is ruining our PVP experience. Jeez.... If you want to PVP at your leisure go to retail with warmode on/off . Camping is and has always been a part of pvp games , besides , its kinda your factions fault that you cant organize a proper counter attack so that they would back off.
---
horde side grobb
---
Practically all the high pop servers to all the medium/low pop ones. So most likely where you'll find a problem to a place where it isn't so much of a problem.
---
I bet you 100 bucks that with proper 1.1 stuff rag would still die within 2 weeks. It was players just being new to the whole MMO and raiding thing.
---
When p-servers did merges, it was based on /played time to decide who got to keep the name and who had to get a new one.
---
Is smderweb on that list for west?
---
Spell doesn't interrupt Mana Regen until the cast completes. So continuously starting and cancelling the cast lets you potentially cast faster.
---
It's more important for large heals, where you're cancelling until th tank gets critically hit. Mage is just doing it for fun or because he really wants to eke out that tiny bit of DPS.
---
Yep. Rerolled to BB and haven't looked back.
---
Roll on a PvE server
---
That's the thing. I can't really control what my tank does.
---
You know something is wrong with the community’s brain capacity when the top comment is trying to explain people have no problem with pve horde players. 
---
It’s a meme, it’s a joke and I think a good one. Don’t know how you guys are so dense.
---
The dps/healing loss from having to stack FR is not even close to the resistance you get. Only tanks should have FR gear for a few fights/trash.
---
Cost of 1 TRYHARD™ MC raid:
---
1x Flask of Supreme Power (~170g, mostly due to black lotus price)
---
~10x Major Mana Potions (~3g ea.)
---
~10x Dark Runes (~3.5g ea.)
---
~5x GFPP (~6g ea.)
---
~5x Nightfin soup (~0.75g total)
---
~5x Rumsey rum  (~0.75g total)
---
1x Elixir of Fortitude (~1g)
---
2x Restorative Potion (~3.5g)
---
1x Greater Shadow Protection Potion (~6.5g)
---
~5x Goblin Sapper Charges (~2g ea.)
---
~10x Oil of Immolation (~0.75g ea.)
---
2x FAP (~1.25g ea.)
---
1x Greater Arcane Elixir (~3.5g)
---
1x Blasted Lands Int Elixir (~15g in mats)
---
Plus 100g / week in respec costs.
---
Total cost is ~420g / week. Oh, and add anything you blow on Onyxia clears to that too.
---
Have your upvote.
---
While you are correct on not dual wielding barbs, crusader is much more affective on a MH regardless of speed as it can proc of any MH hit not just autos, sap, SS and gouge.
---
Sword of Zeal, Krol Blade, and Assassination blade are all pretty good pre-raid swords that can be bought.
---
Mirah's Song and Argent Avenger are both pretty decent swords for tanking dungeons right when you hit 60. Mirah's Song in particular is an awesome ranking sword and OH.
---
Of course Dal'Rends is also a thing. Point being that by going for the staff you can save yourself running Mara or Ulda a bunch and then spend the 2 hours you saved leveling to farm enough gold for a buyable replacement.
---
Thrash Blade is replaceable before you ever step foot in raid and doesn't help drastically with the leveling process. This is especially true if you're non-human.
---
I'm a 50 ally warrior trying to level Rn, but can only log 1-2 hours a day that may or may not be interrupted so dungeon grinding isn't really possible. What areas are good to quest in or grind mobs?
---
First sane comment other than my own I have seen in this subreddit.
---
I see where youre getting at, but isnt this thread a little ironic then lmao.
---
The problem with speccing into a weapon while leveling is not consistently being able to get good ones. Sword spec is common for this not just because the talent is good, but also because there are many good swords as quest rewards. Options to mitigate this issue include:
---
1. Don't get any weapon specific talents and use whatever you want
---
2. Be willing to drop some cash on a new BoE green mace every so often
---
idk what the population split is I haven't looked it up. I know there are times and places where I have been shut down and unable to do what i wanted.  but my instinct is not to immediately complain and blame blizzard or the alliance.  I haven't been participating in the gank squad honor grinding but if i am in a zone where it is going on I ask for an invite to fight back.  there are alternatives to corpse running over and over and over
---
can you give me a quick explainer what you need from felwood herbs &amp; for when?
---
trinket
---
Damn the guy who sold it to me told me it was a twink weapon, I didn't know what that meant he told me basically a bis for a certain lvl racket.
---
Or the wrong server, period. You can hate ganks and fighting the other faction over nodes and have a hell of a time on Heartseeker - provided you picked the correct faction for it.
---
Because my pet already has no right click dps, want me to Micro with /petstay for 200dmg during a 3 min fight? I optimized my LBRS Wolfs talents especially for MC for maximized survivabiltiy and (aura dps) with high health and no right click dmg.
---
See it like this
---
Wolf gives 45-57 dmg every 9 secounds to 5 People, that is almost 250dmg/every 9 secounds. A normal rag fight is approx 3 minutes. 180/9= MY pet will cast Howl 20 Times, giving 250dmg Every time, thats 5000 extra damage during 3 minutes. That is WITHOUT any calculations for crits etc that raise the damage numbers any more, its basicly invincible dmg benefits for your raid group.
---
Just run away from the GY and refuse to resurrect, they cant farm someone whos not there.
---
Buy during the week when prices are low. Sell on the weekends when prices are high 
---
Enchanting supplies have no deposit so I overcharge for those since I can wait to sell them.
---
Wow youre really fired up over this meme
---
Fiery is a great option if you cant afford lifesteal. Putting it on a fast MH makes it very strong, coupled with ss, evis it procs a hell of a lot
---
No, you messed up not doing quests at the right level. delete your toon and restart, it's the only way you can do those quests correctly now.   
---
I'm kidding, I get rid of quests as soon as I'm done wanting to level in that zone. There are a lot of dungeon quests i HIGHLY recommend NOT doing as well, for instance the majority of BRD quests are garbage and not worth it. go through one run, if you don't finish the quests just don't do them (the key is an exception, try to get it so you can go through the back way)
---
I had to quit for a week with every expansion launch, it's always the same story. I'd get to the first escort quest and realize it takes 30+ minutes to start it.
---
do you think 1 druid for FF is worth?
---
If you have a higher level friend to help (50+) its a breeze, otherwise you just do the quest closer to 40 yourself or with someone else around your level and it won't take much time at all.
---
Not to mention the fact that it's a fun questline and the weapon looks/feels awesome/has no RNG to account for. If you're absolutely bent on power leveling I *guess* it might be something to skip but if you're not even level 40 at this stage of the game what's the difference?
---
Naxx was never anything but a gear check, so that won't really be surprising at all.
---
Yeah I’ve never seen any option to transfer from my server and it’s always at high pop. I really just want to roll off a PVP server because it’s nothing like it was back in the day, but I’ll probably just end up canceling my sub since Blizzard doesn’t seem to want to help this game at all.
---
Skullflame not a good investment.... looks cool is meh. Drillborer Disk is great, or even draconian deflector is on par. 
---
Big ticket items would be dark iron gear for tank FR, nightfall, annihilator weapons. If you get 2 bindings, thunderfury for the tank is amazing but will require guild money.
---
Yeah helping with pots is friendly but 1 arcane and 1 greater fire sell for about 6g total on my server. Asking people to show up with 6g a week to help everybody is reasonable. Also food buffs should be reasonable- 12 stam food is like 40 silver.  Some of the hour elixirs are maybe 50s. Don’t make it required, but recommended and I bet a lot of raiders will want to pump it up.
---
I dont get why everyone is so set on a 19 twink. You cant do AB, you have very few abilities, your spec is inflexabile because of that and its 90% rogues. Level to 29 or 39 and have some real fun.
---
Hot spicy dwarf!
---
creating safe spaces and invulnerability bubbles around players while they are out in the world isn't at all what the game is about. it would be a massive change for the worse that completely undermines the entire premise of the game.
---
there is always retail if you don't want to deal with the harsh realities of an open world mmo.
---
why do you folks always have to resort to personal attacks? i have to do a personal inventory because you're too fragile to handle dying in a video game? and blizzard should fundamentally change a 15 year old game to soothe your ego? grow up, you're better than that.
---
Which server are you on? EU seems to have good options
---
Where's your proof
---
If you do actually finish it properly it's still a pain. After the horrible run to the helicopter he just leaves you there. Your options are hearth or run all the way back through all the stuff to get killed again.
---
&gt; Because my pet already has no right click dps, want me to Micro with /petstay for 200dmg during a 3 min fight? 
---
I mean yeah?
---
Everyone else is minmaxing their dps why shouldn't you? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Wolf gives 45-57 dmg every 9 secounds to 5 People, that is almost 250dmg/every 9 secounds 
---
I'm aware. That's 27 dps. Your cat does more than 27 dps above wolf, even on a fight like rag.
---
English might not be their first language. No need to be a dick
---
How do you even break brackets without being in a premade? We have a random warlock doing 16h+ a day atm and we expect him to fall behind in a week since he's not going to have anyone to play with.
---
nymh videos age like fine wine
---
Most of the super early clears only had a couple of people with the douses. To get more, these groups had warlock stations summoning people out to Azshara and back to MC.
---
Most of them are adult guilds who recognize that everyone is showing up on time and with their shit together so they don't have to spend an extra hour in a 15 year old dungeon too. Nobody but the top 1% care about world firsts or top10 clear times. The rest just want to spend less than 2 hours a night raiding so they can play the game the way they want to. If the GM makes that apparent from the beginning, and you don't agree, yeah go find another guild. There are literally thousands of them. I'm not going to run around screaming that they are shitlords and playing the game wrong just because I wasn't a good fit and wanted to semi-afk during Rag because Auto-shot and raid buffs is "gud enuff"
---
Oh I actually didn't rly consider that at start. It prolly is but I haven't looked at rag armor
---
Hunter, but you'll get out-scaled.
---
I'm horde there, it annoys me just as much as it does you. Because of that shit I'm literally only logging in for certain dungeon runs and raids. I rolled a PvP server in hope of doing some PvP, I have literally nothing to do. There is no fun for me to ride through the contested zones in hopes of finding alliance to fight. They are either all solo or there are 20 horde players on 5 alliance in moments. 
---
The only alliance that can do shit are the hitsquads that attack you in Kargath or similar before Horde opposition can form and then they go to the next spot. I wish this was a BC server, then I could've just rolled Draenei and would've been fine.
---
You know it's a  bad post when OP doesn't even address the comments :P
---
Ease of level and available gear. The agi gear at level 19 as well as the weapons available are quite overpowered for the bracket. This coupled with the lack of skills classes have at this level makes the top tier geared players absolute wrecking balls
---
The majority of people who play World of Warcraft are braindead idiots that have to be told exactly what to do and when to do it.  Marking multiple targets for a kill order in every pull is a crutch for babies who can't use their brain to figure out how the game works.
---
I hope they do something about it, gates opening the first day of second week on every server will be a big problem.
---
I would faction change every minute. I hate being on Horde right now its so boring
---
It's not just a no changes thing though, some of the proposed transfer scenarios would help the people posting them but screw over other parties.
---
Press the "Shop" button in the bottom left corner of the character screen. If there's a transfer available it will be visible there
---
druids fucking
---
Sulfuras is one of the most equally balanced horde and ally pop servers with good guilds on each side
---
the most optimal thing would be a mana regen specced enhance with nightfall totem twisting wf and threat reduction totem, which equates to about 2 warrs dps when added all up, assuming they're in a 4 warr group.
---
You're worth honor when you respawn

GORAKS GUIDE TO AZEROTH /checkmate
---
I know I am looking forward to both the 39 and 49 brackets with my planned shaman twink. Interested to see the difference in fully twinked leather at 39 and fully twinked mail at 49. Also considering making two separate twinks as the 39 bracket offers great elemental and enhancement potential. I plan on farming both ele/eht gear sets and doing an in-depth comparison of both specs using SOJ for both. Excited to get to work on that. What level bracket/class/spec are you planning?
---
Game specific subreddits used to be better before it was all complaints directed at the devs. Used to be that people would be told to post feedback on the official forums, but the official forums are shit so people posted on Reddit instead and now Reddit sucks too.
---
ROFL, I see you Typhonus and Yume!  Scrubs.  :D &lt;3
---
How exactly do you propose to, for the sake of this hypothetical, balance servers where ~30% more people decided to play one faction over the other?  You can't force people to play a faction they don't want to play.
---
The Shaman water totem q would like a word with you
---
It sucks ass. At least you get to play the game, even though it is mostly corpse walking. You at least have the choice of forming a group to fight people in WS, etc.
---
As Horde I can't do this. Or well, as you can see on the picture, I can. But there is no point in it. I'm not fighting the alliance, I'm just using frostshock and they die before I can do anything else. Ohh such gameplay, very wow.
---
I will probably create a character on the most horde dominated server I can find just so I can fight Horde in PvP. But I really don't want to go through the leveling process again.
---
Hes a stun lock rogue... 50 noes and 1 yes still means no
---
Poor choice of words...my bad. Exit combat and stealth back up to repeat ganking.
---
Everyone’s talking about the HS queue bug/feature but I’ve also read that the dmg gain is negligible and that even missing one bloodthirst negates the increase.
---
Forget to shop the part where the highest rank says Master Sergeant on the other guy?
---
They have the best jokes too
---
What's done is done. Blizz was irresponsible in their server size choice. But it's over now. Your options: tough it out and hope hordies realize their raid groups are ruining their honor grind, reroll on a pve server, or go make an undead rogue and spit on everyone
---
The hearthstone one is not lined up properly. Sorry lol.
---
Might be silly but i guess you habe checked that the warlock/s who cast CoE/CoS/CoR dont cast agony or doom cuz that will ofc delete the other curse they casted. Again, i guess this is not the case but worth double checking to be sure :)
---
Interesting, I’ll check it out. Thanks you for help.
---
Just corruption the first two adds on domo that are being tankdd and then just lay into the mob with bolts and shadowbhrns. Rinse repeat. Aoeing can sometimes be worth but for the most part you just want to bolt. You can check my profile Coopes on Skeram if you want, happy to help on any fights you may need.
---
I'd still spec into swords as when you hit 60 it'll be easier to get swords than maces.
---
Just tank 2h arms. Sweeping strikes legit makes you a god when fully geared especially on horde.
---
&gt; knowing how much work westfall stew takes
---
I'll take one mud pie, please
---
Sweet, let just find more ways to hammer the already incapable servers.
---
Duble effect spells like frostbolt or frost shock with damage and slow can't be partial resisted, but they can resist full of any effect slow or damage. 
---
Melee elemental damage can be resisted.
---
Do you actually feel smart when you parrot that?

---
Yup. That's completely reasonable. 
---
Sometimes I feel like I don't get as much back as I give. Like I go out of my way to help people finish a quest, or save an enemy from death to a mob. Or answer 5 million questions a noob has. Or donate something to a poor guildy. Or diffuse arguments in chat. Not even sure why I do it. I guess I just want everyone to have the best experience possible.
---
And while all that's fine and dandy, sometimes I just feel exhausted doing all that. I realized now it's quite ok to feel that way, and to take a step back. Take care of my own needs. Lower my expectations, rather than hoping one day the kindness will be returned. 
---
Maybe this is one huge analogy for my life. Lol. 🤷‍♀️
---
yes delete this trash add on
---
Well my first thought was the Frostmane Trolls in Dun Morogh, but last I heard was that those guys are all hostile to the Horde. My second thought was the Mo'grosh Ogres in Loch Modan, but I don't know if those guys are friendly to the Horde and I can't find out online. The Blackrocks of Redridge are also hostile to the Horde.
---
There are a bunch of Horde-friendly quest targets in the east part of Ashenvale, like the Forsaken and Orcs at the lumber mill area, but that's not too common a questing ground and it's also at the extreme high-level of who you can realistically take on as a level 1 twink. The Alliance definitely have their griefing game much easier with the Kul'tirans in Durotar and the Northwatch bros south of Ratchet in the Barrens.
---
Your solution would just drag out the problem. If there aren't battle groups, what will the horde do on dominated servers? Go out and continue mass slaughter wpvp while they wait in queues. Except in this scenario the ally pvpers will be insta-queueing into bg's. So who will the horde be killing? Low levels and those trying to get gear. No battle groups is the worst possible idea for today's classic if you're seeking to fix wpvp imbalances
---
This weapon is the single best Paladin PvP weapon in the game, so BIG GRATS!!
---
Apparently the healing aura scales 1:1 with +healing. And that ticks every 5 seconds. So if you're wearing your full healing gear in a battleground you'll have like +600 healing. Meaning you self heal for 600 health every 5 seconds!
---
The post reeks of humble brag.
---
Incorrect. If lifestealing procs 3 times more then crusader then you have a higher chance for it to proc.... Its basic math. EVERY geared twink rogue I've seen can burst down 90% of its enemy's in just a few hits. That is fact. So if I can kill someone in say 6 hits, I would want either +agi or some other enchant that has the highest chance to proc to end the fight faster. 
---
I have personally ran crusader before on my MH Shadowfang. I ended up switching it for +15 agi because it rarely proc'd.
---
Because of the ability to level a character in 10-15 hours, gear them in permanent BiS gear, and ROFL PWN anyone attempting to PvP in that level range who isn't fully decked. in other words low time investment, high gold investment, and a character that guarantees to provide fun for the remainder of Classic. Rogues aren't even especially favored at 19, and while this was the case in vanilla, I imagine classic will favor other classes at 19 such as Priest or Hunter.

Maybe you should roll on a non-pvp server , eh?
---
Why would you stealth even stealth at 19? You move way to slow. Ambush is fun sure, but your main damage output is all SS.
---
Based on beta values AV will be higher honor per hour provided both sides do the expected rushdown strategy.
---
You can swap gear around after you equip sword and it keeps snapshotted +heal value.
---
Mage.
---
So PvP is meant to be player vs players? I'm not commenting on what is actually happening. I'm asking whether or not PvP has a shared definition.
---
Nice
---
What performs better in solo wPvP? Ret or holy pally. Assuming poor gearing.
---
BR????
---
Best part you know exactly what it sounds like, may it fill you with joy as you load into your battleground
---
Back in late vanilla my good friend got me into wow, and ran me through many dungeons, and taught me a lot about the game.  In classic, because of life differences, I started when he was in his thirties, and I got sixty while he was still in his thirties.  So to my delight I now get to help him on his journey.  I plan to pay for most of his mount, when he hits 40.  
---
You are right.  You should take care of your friends in this game.  It is absolutely the whole point.
---
What’s the other meaning for the word twink? I don’t understand.
---
Depends on how you take it. The Germans killed 50% more Russians than they killed Germans even on the battles the Russians won.
---
That's AWESOME!
---
I think I'm gonna spend a bit more time in Strat then. I know the odds of getting it are absolutely insanely low (one in twenty-thousand if I'm interpreting that correctly) but you can't get it if you don't run Strat and I'll eventually need the argent dawn rep anyway. That seems RIDONCULOUS in PvP. Like, you bubble and you're gauranteed to heal \~4800 while bubbled if you have decent healing gear so you don't really need to worry about healing while bubbled and instead can focus on offense. And it would make fights vs warlocks MUCH easier as you've just got so much more sustainability. Sure, you still gotta actually kill them, which takes a while, but typically my losses to warlocks are just that they've slowly depleted my mana and then my health over the course of about 3 or 4 minutes (pally vs lock is a crazy matchup in vanilla I've found). Similar vs shadow priests (though I find I usually win vs shadow priests.) Man, this weapon seems sick!
---
have you read anything i’ve been responding to of people who actually have tried to help and answer the question I asked? they’ve been extremely articulate and super helpful, offering up some things I never would have thought of. 
---
the comment asking me about my WoW addiction was annoying, disrespectful, and in no way contributed to the discussion question I asked and the guy who posted it stopped responding after I called him out about frivolously making accusations on the internet with no intent of responsibility.
---
No worries, also even if u have more than 3 locks its optimal to let those with sm/ruin spec have priority on casting corruption over for example a ds/ruin lock since the ds/ruin will not gain the nightfall proc where as the sm/ruin will, also even if u run many locks i wouldnt reccommend using agony (even if said warlock doesnt have another curse assignment) since its shit dmg until the end of its duration and then the target is more than likely dead when u clear mc in a bit over 1h (similar to my guilds cleartimes)
---
I wish I had the answer to that. Entire guild transfers?
---
20 runs and Valor leggings never drop.
---
Far from the truth in my opinion and the sub, people is really loving Warhammer and it's DLCs
---
Disagree on that - there are a couple people like that, but the vast majority camp you for the honor.
---
And have approximately 500 hp/5 too.
---
Youtube 19 twink rogue, watch some videos and get back to me. 90% of what you will see is a rogue in a group of 2-4 enemies SS spaming and destroying them. Enemies will continue to trikle in and die. No time for stealth at all. Then come back here. Ill await your surrender
---
we usually have somewhere between 3-6 locks running with us at a time. just depends. I linked my friend this reddit chat and your comments. I appreciate the help, man!
---
Damage is low but the extra attack is really sweet. Same with the Thrash blade but the orc racial gives bonus hit chance.
---
You don't even need to wear it - put it on, equip sword, change gear.
---
is there a particular part you are having issues with
---
I think that line is from MadSeason's video
---
Lovely!
---
I've always been horde and now I'm leveling an alliance character to experience the other side. Westfall Stew will be one of the things I remember the most from that zone. Great art ^_^
---
You are splitting hairs on definitions. If you play on PVP servers, expect to get killed a lot. Any illusions to the contrary are just naive.
---
Don't they get DR from the honorless kill though?
---
queue &gt; HS &gt; win in 20 mins &gt; HS on CD &gt; queue &gt; fly
---
Unless you're expecting every BG to take over an hour.
---
Leveling 19 to 29 is nothing compared to the time investment for a proper twink.
---
Me as a horde player on a pvp server that doesn't pvp

[popcorn](https://media.giphy.com/media/fV2lVLTImW4F255Et3/giphy.gif)
---
Hmm... I don't recall this being the case. I played a rogue in vanilla and the only priests I would think twice about were well-geared shadow priests.
---
You know that might be a solution.  Open up faction transfers on the same servers.  One way from majority to minority.
---
If you already have it but haven't equipped, just keep it and resell it later. 
---
If you have already equipped it, you might as well use it.
---
The weapon the dude above mentioned is 90% as good for a fraction of the cost, but it's not 'better'.
---
Your looking at several months of 4-8 hour days of battlegrounds to get to 11. Its about 75% of the grind to 14 BUT you have to still compete like you would going for rank 14 to GET to rank 11 if that makes sense. The last bit of the grind will be just as hard, just a few weeks shorter in duration without the full 12 hour days near the end.
---
Wholesome meme +1 karma ❤️❤️
---
Your fault for not having your own group
---
Depends on where you started last week.
---
If you rolled PVP, it’s your own fault. End of discussion. Anyone with a brain knew phase 2 would be a corpse farming shit show on PVP servers.
---
I'd rather see something fair for everyone.  Unless something changes, the balance is only going to get worse.
---
Idk that no soak huhuran strat sounds like some scurry hair pulling type shit.
---
You the guy that says HoJ dropped on the first run
---
Pause your account, start a new one
---
I have no problem with getting killed. I've become quite adept at it. My argument is that PvP isn't what it's meant to be on servers with a massive discrepancy. 
---
What hairs am im I splitting?
---
I had a few priest mates that would go days without a death. Obviously they arent running around solo flag carrying etc. myself or another guildy would always be bodyguarding them. PW: shield + renew is the ultimate combo at that level.
---
“Paladins can watch”
---
There are literally 4 top level comments including yours, which is the new top.  One of them literally says “Noice”.  Top comment doesn’t mean anything when there are literally 2 to choose from.
---
Well really there isn't a huge time investment for twinks. It's more a gold sink then time sink IMO.
---
Haha. Well now I'll never NOT see it.
---
Not sure if that actually is the case, most of the time there are just so many hordes that you think someone is corpsecamping you, but it's just 5 new people that happened to be passing by.
---
Man, you should legit consider building your tank spec around this weapon. We're talking find every piece of +healing gear you can get, snapshotting it by equipping this, then throw together a two handed weapon tank build. You'd need all the +parry and +dodge you can get, and all the armor you can possibly muster, but healing for like 800 every 5 secs actually would make up for the loss of a shield I think.
---
Lol guildie said the same thing after 4 Druid T2 helms and 2 rings of bindings In the last two onyxias FML, (0 blood fang drops ever)
---
If youre on a pvp server: avoid roads.
---
Menethil was getting camped last night and no one was trying to stop them. Finally got on the FP to IF and saw 100s of 60s jumping in circles. So I believe your comment to be 100% accurate.
---
Felwood is an amazing play to came as a Gnome Rogue.
---
...I'm not even trying to kill people. Just Sap the last person in the Congo line.
---
Vanish/cloak up and sprint...
---
They get real mad when they can't find you!
---
Was, rinse, repeat. Excellent way to spend a Saturday night, drunk and laughing your ass off!
---
I play on a pve and a pvp, while not all pvpers are dicks (lol) the environment is generally more laid back and players are more mature on the pve server. Double edge sword though, way more casual guilds which means when harder tiers hit i imagine some guilds will just hit a wall.
---
there are plenty of spots especially in alliance towns with shit all guards 
---
i feel like safe spotting is more areas where there are guards but they cant reach them due to terrain exploits 
---
im guessing there is just no or like 1 guard here and they killed it
---
It'll actually be possible to level outside once the Bags drop tho
---
Roll on a pve server. You can flag yourself anytime you want pvp, but it removes the annoyance.
---
Yes. They shat in their bed, now they should lie in it.
---
I mean if that’s what give them satisfaction in life, that’s a weird way to get enjoyment.
---
Balancing server factions will not solve this issue. There’s too many people on these servers. Balancing the factions would simply lead to both factions complaining that the game is unplayable rather then just alliance complaining. Bg’s I think will help.
---
&gt; If you like gold, start leveling a mage to 60 so you can farm Bijous right when ZG releases.
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
All you did was insult this sub's user base in reply to someone else's suggestion, and I reacted to your opinion and tone. I elaborated when you replied to me. 
---
There no big argument here to respond to. 
---
And now all you're doing is misconstruing what I said and what this was all about.
---
For me it's always 55-60 that is the roughest because you start running out of quests and I don't like spamming dungeons.
---
The only part of this quest that really annoys me is that once you're on that island, where the fuck are you supposed to go? The quest giver says that he doesn't want you to inconvenience yourself and travel all the way back to IF, but honestly, you might as well just hearthstone out since he gets you to go the the most isolated point in Azshara.
---
You can also fish very peacefully in Wailing Caverns instance
---
The difference between you, the sub, and I is that in contrast I play multiplayer - I'd be surprised if you do. My general experience is terrible game balance, abandoned factions, and more DLC which perpetuates and exacerbates this imbalance both in the campaign and in battle.
---
The rarity alone makes it extremely valuable. Personally, if this doesn't sell for 75g or more in the timeframe (if you have one) you set, I would sink the time into creating a rogue twink. Combat Maces at 39 is good fun!
---
It was announced there was a bug and it was fixed.
---
No, the minority faction will either be in BGs, or levelling alts on other servers.
---
And if the majority faction doesnt like two day queues ... well, they shat in their bed, let them lie in it.
---
No, the display is still busted as their bluepost says cause yeah. Small indie company
---
And yet we're here playing a replica of a 15 year old game...
---
Kromcrush
---
I just use /cast multi-shot
---
/cast furious growl
---
Both on 10s cooldowns. Symbiotic.
---
It's what minority faction people are doing.
---
But there was...
---
It was a joke haha we weren’t literally trying to summon p2
---
I agree I think BG's will help. I'm curious though, how would it make the game unplayable by balancing the factions?
---
Oh my bad- I thought I read it was fixed.
---
[here's your proof](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/honor-calculations/364258/244)
---
cya bud.
---
&gt;At least you get to play the game, even though it is mostly corpse walking.
---
Wait, what? No one is forcing you to stand there corpse camping another player spamming frost shock. You can go run a dungeon. Or farm something. Or herb/mine. Do a world boss. Get some buffs for your raid. You're essentially playing the game on a PvE server.
---
They can't. The "game" they play is running to their corpse and trying to find the best place to res. Go ahead and make a char on the weaker faction of the most imbalanced server in your region. Competing for rare and very sought after mobs &gt;&gt; being a mob that's being farmed.
---
Moving backwards is considered walking.  If you are slowed enough to the point where the game considers you walking, then the combat you are in does not benefit from leeway.
---
All of the best 19 twink rogues in the history of the game were running agi or lifestealing. There has been countless posts in the years going over everything. There is no spreadsheets needed. A few are running crusader for their MH but have also agreed it rarely proc'd. 
---
I have a feeling you already wasted money enchanting crusader and are just looking for justification. I'm sorry to burst your bubble but any rogue running ago or life will beat you.
---
Do you know what high queue times means for alliance players on that server?
---
You know what horde does when they go have 1 hour queues?
---
They do the exact same thing they are doing right now.
---
It wasn’t like this 15 years ago.
---
Oh I'm sure if they haven't horde wound't even consider doing what they do to farm honor points. Yup, all this is just "revenge".
---
why are posts like this allowed?
---
Down voted because people are too childish to accept the truth lol
---
Someone will comment "I can hear this image" like the 3 other times it has been posted and it sill be top comment
---
How is this even possible? With those combat numbers it must have taken like 100+ swings to kill him? Was he AFK?
---
Remind me
---
youre so cool, how do i become like you?
---
Another “go to retail” shitforbrains. Yawn
---
That's the data they have and it's good data, it's a very solid example of their expected player base and how they go through the vanilla wow experience, they'd have been stupid to not look at what pserver data they could get their hands on
---
You're right, the servers would shit out any time more than 80 people were in the same area and it would become unplayable.
---
It's much better now.
---
Your previous comment says Thalnos is 4/96. I quote:
---
" Thalnos: 4/96 "
---
The picture you just provided is not what you said above. You are refuting your own numbers by showing that 23% more of the realm is Alliance. Are you on drugs?
---
&gt; I don’t understand why they released honor without battlegrounds and or arenas
---
Are you entirely ignorant then as to the roadmap Blizzard outlined for their phases, and the reason for them?
---
This is the "I'm leaving Facebook because of the drama" of Reddit posts.
---
Can you really not see the other perspective? You think players on your faction not insulting you, their comrade, is in some way comparable to the enemy insulting you?
---
Its exactly the same people behaving in exactly the same way on either faction.  Just think about it for one second.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Minority faction are going to either be in BGs, or levelling their alts on other servers.
---
That horse has bolted. Gone. The minority factions are dead.
---
And I'm sorry that means you have no one to fight. Can I suggest rerolling on a server where you faction is in the minority, so you can have people to fight ?
---
What are you on about?
---
PVP is whatever the games PVP system is. A PVP server in WoW is a free for all. The game uses a system that encourages honor farm groups for rewards. 
---
If you just read PvP and thought that meant the system somehow imposes only 1 v 1 then sorry you misunderstood/did zero research? Just seems incredibly dumb and trolly to me, if you ask someone if a game has a pvp system they aren't going to go no because it isn't strictly 1v1. PVP has always just meant players can kill other players for the last 20 years.
---
The books are unique aren’t they? Perhaps it dropped a book that you already had?
---
Hunter
---
people need honor. The rewards for higher ranks are extremely good. The only way to get honor is world pvp. feel morally justified all you want ganking people day and night is the only way to get the best gear. blizzard needs to change its systems if you want this to end.
---
&gt; that’s a weird way to get enjoyment
---
Being terrible to other people anonymously online, with almost no repercussions at all?
---
Yeah, that's very odd. Hardly *anyone* would do that.
---
I think rewards are good but a free 300 would flood the server and cheapen professions for those who worked their asses off. That said I have no alternative option to suggest as a reward. It's hard to predict the impact.
---
I post here while I wait for my respawn timer to countdown on my run to BRM. I just made it to the gates and I need to make it to BRD. I expect to be able to play the game in about 30mins from now.
---
I also tank MC/Ony. I feel like a clown for not having my HoJ yet. Blackhand’s breadth I feel is laughable next to my mark of chosen. Just my opinion on the matter. The status of BRM makes it a joy to farm
---
Well, I can see this was a mistake. I should of known better than to expect anything other than shitty remarks and coldness from the wow community. What a surprise.
---
What stops people from running around with low levels, essentially being unkillable ?
---
Any more details you could share? I’ve gone through the menu system and haven’t seen this option.
---
Sorry you can’t even play dude, very nicely written.  Hopefully things will change or you will take a reset and consider restarting on another server.  Let the others have their empty world, which they will have created for themselves.
---
I usually set aside about 25 mins to get a nice stack of about 5 to 10 pre rolls before I sit down for a dungeon. Oh.. Wait.
---
You wouldn't even need "naxx" stuff, just go search for "Of Healing" green gear on the AH, you could probably get at least 300 or 400 +heal that way, equip the sword, then switch to your normal gear.
---
Ahhh yeah sorry Tier 1 in relation to 19 twink gear :)
---
Here comes the insults. :)
---
I'm always waiting as a tank.  When I see the healers Mana low and they aren't drinking I ask if they are good to go and they usually will start drinking.  Do the same with mages sometimes.  I don't mind waiting at all.
---
Wait what fire res buff?
---
Scrolling battle text addon? How to show trinkets on bottom left of screen? Noob here. Please advise how to not bee noob.
---
I actually found pre phase 2 there was less aggressive pvp than what i experienced in vanilla. But post p2 pvp has been much more aggressive.
---
I think it suggests players now are more focused on obtaining rewards. Pre-p2 everyone was too busy levelling and grinding for gear to spend time pvping. Now that p2 is here everyone is aggressively pvping to get the rewards.
---
The main difference to me is vanilla you had lots of people playing in their own way at their own pace. In classic everyone seems more results focused and want their bis gear set
---
Sorry it's upset you so much. Unfortunately I'd say your position isn't one that encourages problem solving so much as player blaming. Not what I was looking for when I posted but ty for your comments. I hope that doesn't come across as provocative, I certainly don't mean to be.
---
Guards have multiple behaviours however these guards likely only attack when players are within a certain range of civilians.
---
If you have to leave the instance and zone back in to get the new, freshly reset instance ID, then what benefit are you getting? You join a party with your alt as you described so that you can...reset the instance on your alt instead of your main, even though you have to leave anyways? 
---
I don't get it. Help?

---
What stamina buff is Elixir of Brute force not stack with?
---
Okay Zoomer.
---
It really depends on queue times, it wasn't uncommon in vanilla to just station a guy at battle masters and wpvp in the world during queues. 
---
We are starting with cross realm though so 4 hour AV queues shouldn't be a thing.
---
No they wont all the allys will be in bgs
---
So you can insult people by broadly grouping someone into horde or ally which in this subs case is portrayed as victim and mindless killers and not expect blowback?
---
Sounds very similar to oh shit I got ganked on a pvp server
---
I thought a twink was a bone thin dude in gay lingo.
---
AGM/fishing hat takes some commitment.
---
If you're Horde, BRD escort runs from 52-60. Good groups were averaging a tad over 100k xp / hr
---
Thats a crazy amount
---
Thanks for the reply
---
I'll make a really spicey meme for you tomorrow, and post it.  You're going to love it.
---
Shoulda warstomped and executed from behind like Sony did.
---
Well I played a bit on a popular (around 10k+ online) vanilla server and I never experienced anything close to what I've seen in classic p2. So I guess I don't know.
---
Fact is I didn't get insult for Alliance players, only by the Horde players.
---
And you trying to "open my view" with your speech? Oh God, in what world we are living... I will take any tips about life on r/classicwow. /s
---
Definitely a good goal to aim for and one I'm sure Blizzard takes into account as enjoyable and sustainable gameplay affects their bottom dollar. I just think that more people would cancel their subscription if changes were made on PvP servers to alter gameplay. I don't think that is faction changes would be offered as this didn't exist in vanilla. Even if they were offered people have guilds, friends, and racial abilities to consider and these would probably prevent the majority from swapping. I also don't think that rewards should be offered for switching to the minority faction. This only incentivizes people who are sub-par PvP'ers to transfer faction and wouldn't benefit the minority. This is purely speculative and just my outlook/opinion.
---
It’s definitely not a crime and a friendly thing to do for the squad! But most groups I’ve played with expect a greater fire pot for Rag and maybe arcane for Shaz. If some people forget it’s good to have some extras.
---
Yeah that would totally work dude. Big fight at SS flight point? Just have some level 1s fly in and derank the entire enemy force.
---
No, you just dont like the answer. You also cant accept it. It's fine man, I remember a time when I couldn't accept that I was wrong too. There are plenty of players like you that think you are always right. I try to educate people like you but I see it's not working. 
---
I would suggest you try going back to retail.
---
&gt; Yes, that person was me. Something you appear to be missing though is that the "alternatives" is that Bonebiter is alliance only, requires level 34 and ***realistically*** **you aren't going to be getting it until 36-37 unless you have a group carry you.** Ravager requires 37, is a random drop, and will be contested. I leveled with two warrior mates and we did a bunch of SM, didn't see it. 
---
You can actually unironically say this while talking about getting WW axe at 30. lol?
---
&gt;At absolute worst you complete a fun quest chain
---
You were talking about being worthwhile for leveling. Irrelevant.
---
&gt; and get a stupidly good axe with no peer for 4 levels
---
See above point about WW axe at 30 lmao
---
&gt; and not likely to be replaced for 7-8 without *needing* to be replaced for a good 15 or even 20 levels
---
What does that even mean, NEEDING to replace your weapon? You absolutely should replace WW axe far earlier than level 50 lmfao. 
---
&gt;For 5 hours time spent (and it can be done a lot faster than that) that is seriously time well spent... and you do get a good chunk of XP from it all, it's not like you're giving up leveling entirely. 
---
You think you're going to gain 5 hours /played from a \~6 DPS upgrade? Are you out of your mind? 
---
You seem to think that I'm claiming WW axe is a bad item that you shouldn't equip if it appeared in your inventory at 30. Everyone knows WW axe is broken for a level 30, the point is that it's not worth it to obtain if your goal is to level efficiently.
---
Why do you think it is that you feel it's unplayable and others on your faction, on your server, are enjoying this phase?
---
Because their experience, like yours is subjective.  You need to accept that your experience is unique and not the same as others if you wish your words to carry weight. 
---
Unplayable is your subjective opinion and is not a universal truth.
---
Looks like they just changed it. Tried it. Didn't give me the buff.
---
As alliance where's the closest place to rest/repair near SM if I'm going to be there for the next 12-13 levels?
---
Made a rogue alt cause leveling my 50 lock is a nightmare and a half. Servers are way too populated. I think bgs will help but it will still be pretty bad.
---
Classic to me is about unfinished business. Walking the paths I ignored or just didn't have the time/gumption/perseverance to complete in vanilla. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed healing until TBC. Going to get my resto shaman to max and raid (hopefully). Play some "meme" spec characters. With as many min/maxers out there I feel like raids can afford to carry some less viable classes through raids. Not like we are creating the wheel here, this has literally all been done before. It's always fantastic making new friends and having new experiences in a game I have treasured memories from.
---
I leveled from 15-60 as Holy just because everyone told me not to do it, and let me tell you somethin... 
---
don't do it.
---
The graveyard is right there. I've never seen a lot of hordes there, but YMMV.
---
That is not even close to somewhat reliable.
---
It is worse than useless since it literally only polls people who are uploading logs.
---
Sigh yet again more nonsense, i havent even leveled an alt so im not sure what you mean by send you a name. Feel free to continue to attack me because you dont have the ability to communicate though, really shows the depth of your knowledge and expertise in the field
---
or it's clearly a fake photoshop.  Check their highest rank, the part he forgot to change lol
---
I was 56 when p2 dropped so questing was basically out of the question lol. Dungeon spamming was the best way for me to finish it off.
---
I remember reading it was something like 6c per point of xp.
---
The game does not make you an asshole even if it rewards asshole behaviour.
---
I you own those two accounts, it's against TOS.   
---
If you don't know the other guy and you are just playing AH, it's fine.
---
Feralas
---
The mortars got me.
---
im only casual
---
&gt; You can actually unironically say this while talking about getting WW axe at 30. lol?
---
A group of five players can do it no problem. We did it with 3 for a mate at level 32.
---
&gt; Are you really trying to argue the position that an individual warrior is unlikely to get Ravager or that it's somehow a rare drop? lol?
---
No, that WW is much easier to get. And sooner.
---
&gt; Even if that were true, which it isn't, 
---
It is.
---
&gt; the benefit is that you can be leveling efficiently while farming for Ravager and would otherwise be in there anyway even if it didn't exist. The same can not be said for WW axe.
---
Wrong. I'm sorry it took you 5 hours, it really shouldn't.
---
&gt; You were talking about being worthwhile for leveling. Irrelevant.
---
Wrong, the leveling experience matters and you do not need to "be OCD about quests" to want to do a fun quest with a great reward.
---
&gt; What does that even mean, NEEDING to replace your weapon? You absolutely should replace WW axe far earlier than level 50 lmfao.
---
These two statements next to each other are utterly baffling to me. So you don't understand needing to replace things but also you should replace them? Right.
---
&gt; Again, it absolutely is not. The opportunity cost is simply not worth it in terms of leveling speed.
---
Wrong. Be more efficient. 
---
&gt; You seem to think that I'm claiming WW axe is a bad item that you shouldn't equip if it appeared in your inventory at 30. Everyone knows WW axe is broken for a level 30, the point is that it's not worth it to obtain if your goal is to level quickly.
---
Yes it absolutely is. 
---
I'm over this, you play how you want mate. Have a good one.
---
Both Incendius and benediction seem fairly balanced. Leaning Incendius due to I having a higher overall population

If the game rewards you for being an asshole you were still an asshole.
---
Do the loop in dead wind pass and farm the birds.  They are lvl 55 vultures that drop some good vendor greys and that zone is usually ignored by most players.
---
It's amazing what you can do during a work break when you've been thinking about it all shift.
---
Blizz won't do that. It will be: if you transfer, you have to change your name if it's taken.
---
It's a nice concept in theory, but horde are generally enjoying dominating right now. I can't imagine a scenario where enough people transfer to justify the extended slaughter that's happening in wpvp. If you want to punish the horde yes this is your answer. If you want to fix wpvp, I'm very skeptical about this solution. I'd rather have battle groups that allow honor grinders on both sides to get out of wpvp and into a balanced environment
---
Ahahahaha.
---
Literally no raid fight will need flasks for dps.
---
We are almost hitting patchwerk numbers right now and we aren't even bis Mc geared.
---
The only thing that might require a flask are tanks.
---
Dude gear is going to be even better with the phase system. We'll be going into every new raid with the bis from the previous raids.
---
&gt;More like people don't like systems that can be easily exploited and add nothing to the game beyond targeting someone that has PvP'd a lot.
---
Ok, so tell. How can you easily exploit this? By finding another group that has the debuff and letting them kill you, and then they let you kill them? That's already possible and already against the rules. So how do you exploit it?
---
&gt;I'll happily direct you to a video of a level 36 killing 60's.
---
Let me guess, a hunter? [Guessed wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK-XGqAMqH4). But most lvl 36's can't kill a lvl 60, and even that lvl 36 can't kill all lvl 60's. High-standing PvP players right now have 5~7k health with class buffs. (I did laugh at the use of Gnomish Death Ray. I think I tried in original WoW and decided it was worthless because got a low-end damage output, not knowing it could go as high as it can.) Opponents in the video:
---
At 48 sec, warlock has 2.6k~3k health. Priest at 67 has 2.4k health. Warlock at 91 has 3.5k health.
---
What surprised me the most was how fast this sub switches from memes to actual hostility. It took me way too long to realize that all the Horde player blaming isn't some kind of faction roleplay meme.
---
I quit classic and I’m still here. But I agree with you.. so, so long ppl
---
I'll resell it then, thanks!
---
Tiger was asking for it. Look what it's wearing.
---
I think the novelty is starting to wear off for those who don't plan to push for high rank
---
Same
---
Can you explain specifically what you need a flask for on that fight?
---
That's my point. The world will be even more so horde dominated because anyone who wanted to pvp on ally will insta queue into bgs, making the imbalance worse
---
I'm 56 right now, and have had some glory out of getting ganked. Now, don't get me wrong, usually I will die when a 60 ganks me, but the main advantage currently is that a significant number of gankers just aren't competent at all. Just yesterday I got jumped on by a Rogue, level 60, who did everything wrong he could. I killed him easily, he respawned and tried again. Long story short, quite a good amount of honor in the bag for me, along with bragging rights.
---
Can't log in to check, can someone from rattlegore tell me how much the trash blade is going for?
---
That's the point! Ally pvpers wont be in the world at all but horde pvpers will, making it even worse than it is now. Battle groups get more people out of wpvp slaughters and into balanced environments

His whole channel is hysterical!
---
That indeed is just griefing...

Implying horde wouldn’t be crying in the same position.

They absolutely are not.

Only a titans would be needed, and even that is only maybe for a fight like parchwerk.

35 runs for the cloak. Seen it a few times but lost all so far.

Holy. If you hit like a wet noodle as ret, you might as well go full heals and never die

&gt;follow God
---
Lol I gave up imaginary friends when I was 5, thanks.
---
Guide is to level one time
---
Ahh shit you’re probably right. That would make sense as to why it would be empty. Either way I’ll just keep going till I get it 😂
---
I feel like a genie.
---
I can hear this image
---
Mages make money for clicking a water button &amp; portal button.. why can't we tanks put it a load of effort for people and do the same, we are only utilizing our class' unique characteristics in the same way! :D
---
You get some decent swords around level 35-39. One from Scarlet Monestary quest, one from Razorfen down quest.
---
I didn’t but honestly I had my headphones in so I wouldn’t have noticed noises. As for the glitches I didn’t notice anything but I was using wireless so idk if that makes a difference
---
On grobbulus the 4chan guilds rolled ally and wore white robes and ran around with black characters on their knees.
---
A fucking politician called blizzard out to finally end this racist fuckhead. His guild split in two and the major racists made a new guild called Martial law and the GM is named after Hitlers dog and the officer is named after one of hitlers officers.
---
No player done damage can dismount a player.
---
Any kind of polymorph effect can.
---
Mobs are able to attack from behind and inflict a special status called "DAZE" which will dismount you.
---
the fact that you find that sexual says more about you than it does about him lmao. well done closet weeb.
---
Yeah communication is so useful.  In your case it means the tank doesn't have to be nervous that he's going too quickly for you. I'm in a guild with a bunch of people who refuse to ever run with PUGs and, meanwhile, I've done 90% of my dungeons with mostly PUGs. When they talk about the difficulties they regularly have with PUGs it's not familiar to me and I think that's simply a matter of me greeting everybody and taking a bit of leadership over the pace and pull strategies. It's all it takes.
---
That's no succubus, that's a semen demon
---
Big lots! $10!
---
Reported!
---
You sound like a clown dude
---
Yeah if quests are green/gray and they take longer than 5 min and do not reward a special item i need or want. They get tossed out.
---
Ya you could I just want it to be totally over the top ridiculous.
---
you really think most are from herod. wow fucking delusional. because of people like asmongold alliance easily had more players. . and many were on here consistently. still are.
---
Would be a neat concept to study for sure. Wonder if any pserver sweaties have done it already.
---
I'm leveling a boomkin for pvp and have two questions:
---
For PvP, for the sake of saving mana and since entangling roots damage is minuscule, should I just be casting rank 1?
---
How does diminishing returns work  on CC in PvP, I was fighting a lvl 29 warrior (I'm 21, was doing well until diminishing returns and I went oom), and after I hit him with roots maybe 3 or 4 times he became immune. Was that him using some ability to be immune to snaring effects, or will players become completely immune to CC after being hit by it a few times in a row?
---
&gt; We should still have layers right now.
---
World bosses would be a MASSIVE issue. How are layers supposed to work with world bosses? Only up on 1? Okay that one layer gets zerged to all hell by the hundreds (literally) of players contesting it. World boss pops on another layer? Mass layer hop.
---
Could mean a guild could monopolize the bosses across multiple layers, multiple times in a week just because they hop across layers and get the kill on each and every single one.
---
Phase 2 has been a hell of a lot of fun.
---
This post made by PvE Alliance gang.
---
But for real though. My heart goes out to all the people who can't unflag for a relaxing grind session.
---
But the worms, where the princess is down the path to your left, and the goblin is at the bottom of the hill if you went straight.

Devilsaur set is useless now. The initial wave of players have surpassed it.

---
lol all good i dont mind man :)
---
Yeah used trashblade even in MC lol.
---
A character that is intentionally kept at a low level but given the best possible gear. BGs are split up by level brackets: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39 etc. You gear out a toon for your preferred bracket and fight other twinks/randos.
---
Most people have a misconception that people only twink to stomp non-twinks. But that's not true in my experience. The most fun I had twinking was fighting other twinks since gear is neutralized and its all down to skill.
---
I tanked all the way to 60 as bear, loved it, had a warden staff, even got the ony attunement armor trinket. Then hit 60 and realized i couldnt find a raid spot as a bear tank and wasnt that interested in the gear prospects, now i play moonkin and boy do i miss being able to tank dungeons...
---
Pretty much.
---
"The issue with the majority faction"
---
There. Fixed it for you. Alliance does the same shit.
---
Grobbgang! I see those guilds
---
Because people want to play the game? Why should people not be allowed to play because they picked one of two fictional factions in a video game? The problem isn't going to go away with BGs either, what will the Horde (and the one Alliance dominated server) do when no one of the opposite faction is playing? Just PVE?
---
Are you not able to switch guilds to find a raid spot?
---
The open world will have less alliance roaming, more horde, and instance-goers/questers are still fucked.
---
Roll a druid/dwarf priest on Skeram and I'll hook you up with some gold and bags and shit.
---
Don't worry, I'm a newb too. Here you go :)
---
The scrolling text is actually right within WoW's interface. Interface Options &gt; Combat &gt; Enable Floating Combat Text and then customize to your liking
---
The trinkets on the bottom left are from an addon called "TrinketMenu" - I highly recommend. Not only can you see them there, but you can mouse over them and then  your other trinkets on you show up and you can click them at ease. Here's the link:  [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24977-TrinketMenuClassic.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24977-TrinketMenuClassic.html)

as a narcoleptic tank this is what i try to do...but wake up inches from smashing my face on the keyboard
---
No
---
Any one have a spray bottle?
---
I have 4k health with 5 piece prophecy on my priest.  All my guilds priests eat up that bis +healing nonsense we all know if you can pvp you can raid.  Im at the bottom of the healing charts, but im the first to res and always die last. 
---
Anyway, i want the fire rune grimoire, whats the best option for onehand?
---
It's too late. Give in.
---
True. It just so happens that the Horde is the dominant faction on all PvP servers except for Heartseeker so he's not entirely wrong.
---
Careful, talking about class balancing is taboo for a lot of the forums
---
That's it?! Hell yeah, gonna check my Big Lots ASAP, thanks.
---
nope! :)

https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15137/menethil-elite
---
I mean... he's *technically* right...
---
They are 55, and have "elite" in their game.
---
Yet, I've never seen them.
---
Right, very impressive then.
---
they probably will, most mobs are leashed since the last few months of TBC. why? because [we used to pull shit like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqoXOQHh1wY), powerleveling people through instances... and it was ridiculous, as in *multiple levels* each clear in the beginning.
---
MeMe Spec: Guildmaster RNG Edition
---
Liger baby
---
The horde car decal sticker did that already.
---
There's also more and more mages every day farming zf and dme each. one of those probably generates as much gold as a 5 man group spamming for prebis per hour.
---
As a guild leader you kept it? Damn dude....
---
"No" what? Not sure that is relevant to anything. But troll on my friend!
---
1. at low level you don't need that much hit, you have DW so you hit x2 more?
---
2. um?
---
3. you never lose threat and do dps equal to other dps?
---
4. yes #1 again
---
5. but how? can you tank dungeons as arms as effective as fury
---
6. ...
---
I can't even do arena/anger/golem runs after work because I need to set aside the extra hour just to get in after having to find a group then actually doing it. 
---
A 30 minute run can easily take me &gt;2 hrs and I just don't have that much time after work.
---
Classic WoW has become a weekend game for me as a result as at level 53 I can't do anything out in the world.
---
Sucks but it's not really the Horde's fault the Rank 14 system is bad.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
ratio is 50/50. sorry alliance seems to just like pve more... the demographic represents this a bit. for some reason more kids/ parent and rpers like alliance while horse tends to be more young adults to older folks who are a bit more involved in pvp. 
---
it's still like this on retail. on the new season alterac, horde won 83% of the time
---
I play both factions and can clearly see the diffrent mindsets.  I would often post for groups for w pvp and on ally no one wanted to join but on horde 5 to 10 players instantly messaged me.   both servers are ally dominated for refrence
---
I mean if spending an hour corpse running to an instance is acceptable gameplay to you then yeah, play the game. A lot of people are still playing clearly. It just wouldn't be worth it to me if that was the situation on my server - I'd play something else.
---
Deleted violation to cow’a privacy issue.
---
Conflag is solid for PVP along with SL builds, and doesn't get much attention.
---
correction: helps a shitter like you avoid getting killed
---
So the solution is for people to just not play? That is ridiculous. "Hey kid, want to stop getting bullied at school? Just stop going to school! /5head".

There is an alliance on Yojamba with 20 accounts who has lvl 1s on the spawn points. This creates the rare occurrence of me willingly hoping that an alliance gets camped by horde.
---
Hey I hope you see this, Sounds like you can cheese it with + healing gear, sounds like fun to try in PvP
---
I rolled Incedius day 1 and have been very happy with my choice! Level 60 hunter an 58 warrior. 48-58 was all done in phase 2 and it still wasn’t miserable on alliance with pvp ganking
---
How does one level as “fury prot”. It’s a level 60 talent build.
---
Almost exalted already trying to get Bonescraper on my rogue without even bothering to turn in stones. Hasn't dropped once yet. No idea how many runs I'm at, but it's a lot. I guess on the bright side I get free Naxx attunement. Already have Perdition and should get the next CHT, I'm sure Bonescraper will drop as soon as I don't need it lol.

is this intentional? its kinda fucked up isn't it?

I started because some friends convinced me but they all bailed and I ended up sticking with it because I have so much fun. It’s not hard to find cool people to play with :)
---
hahaha we will just polymorph/sap u until the debuff wears off. (we already do this with detect magic).
---
Bro I play an Arms warrior, if you're losing to locks and priests you are bad. Dunno what else to tell you fam
---
People gank for fun, not for honor
---
As a first time recent 60, the lack of XP bar is so strange to me. Sometimes I still look at it wondering how much I got in a dungeon.
---
I don't miss anything right now. I really like only being able to work on my gear and guildies gear and professions and epic mount. I'm excited to be the strong rogue I've always dreamed of being.
---
&gt; life tap which will take just as much life as it gives mana.
---
You goofed if you don't have 2/2 improved life tap.
---
God forbid I picked Horde on a PvP server because I love the faction and enjoyed PvP. Suddenly I'm the asshole for being part of the dominant faction..
---
I just wanted to be an Orc man.
---
Are you sure? cuz resistance do work on fire elemental melee at brd!
---
Damn.
---
Fucking clapped.
---
Felcloth gloves are the expensive ones, 100g+, but a huge item for end game warlocks, and worth the 100g+.  
---
Some of the other felcloth items are not BIS and not as expensive.  Worth it while you try to farm out the actual BIS.  Shoulders and head are not bad in particular before you can afford a Green Lens +36 and/or the big +shadow BOEs for those slots.
---
Or start your own guild
---
For Alliance?
---
Try actually using the feature.  It opens the page, but none of the possible transfer servers are selectable.  They're all greyed out.
---
Only horde can transfer off at the moment.
---
I'm still pretty new to everything so I have a question.  What is gearing up like in raids as a bear?  I was under the assumption that it was pretty easy
---
The game has been heavily data mined and optimized after 15 years.  
---
I wouldn't call it brainless.
---
Your raid group mages charge you? The fuck.
---
His crazy person rant was logically flawed. He's entirely wrong.
---
It amazes me people think old raid bosses are comparable to retail mythic.
---
Yes we can all agree LFR is faceroll easy. Weird, almost like it’s intended to be that way.
---
It’s like being mad that BRD is too easy for a group of 5 60s lol.
---
For real I couldnt level in felwood or WPL without getting destroyed by the roaming gnome gank squads. They'll be paid back in kind
---
Ravager has a minimum lvl 37 - WW Axe can be had at 30. It takes less then an hour or two for anyone who knows what they are doing - have done it on 2 Warriors myself since Classic release and helped a bunch of people with it.
---
If you aren't part of the "dungeon cleave Zerg" SM spam then it probably makes for some of the easiest leveling in the game at any point for a Warriorr. 100% worth getting - even if you are in the SM spam it will increase your DPS for those 7 lvls between Ravager and WWw.
---
It’s not really as much about the size of your population as it is the caliber. It’s servers with at least one heavy private server guild that have high lotus prices. The servers with dirt cheap lotus have almost fully casual or new populations.
---
Did you copy my macro EXACTLY?
---
[Comfortable Leather Hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8174/comfortable-leather-hat) is level 35, [Nightscape Headband](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8176/nightscape-headband) would be level 36. So unless you're an engineer or are willing to spend gold on BoEs, those are your options.
---
You forget one thing, without tactical mastery, it is a nightmare to tank while level cuz no one in pug will allow you to get some rage before dpsing.
---
"Your frost nova, your fault" xD
---
Nightscape headband

---
Or
---
White Bandit Mask
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10008/white-bandit-mask
---
Until you realize Warrior leveling isn't amazing with a bad weapon and having WW axe makes that shitty patch of levels completely 180 to a point of ease.
---
Besides being the best healers in the game?
---
&gt; burst
---
The only burst rets have is dependant on their enemy critting them. If everyone ignores the ret, then it's practically as scary as a hunter pet.
---
&gt; stuns
---
You have 1. No interrupts. No gapclosers. No other hard CCs. Maybe you're getting Repentance, but that means no Reckoning.
---
&gt; resets
---
A reset is polymorph, blind or vanish. Bubble/LoH aren't resets, they're just self-healing tools or self-peels in the case of bubble.
---
The strongest part of a paladin's kit in PVP, bubble, is a pointless self-heal for rets and the strongest self-peel for hpals.
---
You do, but that said you don't be using a bow a ton in classic, just phase 1 and 2 is where bows are massive because of Rhok'delar. After that Ashjre'thul and then some gun in nax is what you're after
---
Maybe on private servers but if it's that way in classic it'll be changed in .2 seconds
---
Where are the best/easiest to access neutral AH if I wanted to swamp gold between factions?
---
If you have one or two mages you hellfire after a frost nova is dropped. 
---
Scarlet Monastary spellcleave groups are 1 warlock, 3 mages, and one priest.  Priest bubbles the eye of kilrogg, warlock use the eye to aggro ~1/4 of the entire instance, then the mages frost nova, bliz, CoC, etc. while the warlock helps with AoE and priest heals.
---
Am I supposed to have putty for someone using spy?
---
Oh another post like this..
---
This is anecdotal but I always liked to do an AV run a day then do WSG. 
---
My thought is that AV gave you a bunch of first time HKs from players you might not meet in WSG. 
---
WSG you net higher honor per player killed.
---
ㄱㅅ means thanks in korean
---
You forgot to mention that when I ding 60 I’ll have my epic mount from all the gold I farmed with my epic staff.  Because I’m epic.
---
I'm just rerolling on a PVE server now and giving up a 50 on a PVP server because of the ganking. Can you elaborate on this more?
---
With the standard 5% chance to parry that is 1 in 400 odds or a 0.25% chance of happening. Some of the warriors spec for a few points in Deflection (parry chance) over Improved Heroic Strike so they might have 8% parry chance which would still be a 0.64% chance of happening. 
---
Brutal.
---
Yeah, tbh there’s not shame in clearing MC in a few hours. It’s definitely something to strive to improve so you can keep adding more gear to the guild in phase 3, but especially if you didn’t start for a few months, nothing wrong with clearing the lockout
---
&gt; In 20 words or fewer,
---
Do the 20 words include the mandatory “All hail glorious party leader Xi and respect the territorial sovereignty of China”? Because then we’re down to 7.
---
I experienced the same thing. Horde took control of Kargath. I mount up and make it to BRM gates.
---
Literally died 6 times to make it to the UBRS portal.
---
Big voodoo mask?
---
Some of us don’t spend 10+ hours a day tucked in our rooms playing video games.
---
I apologize for not being your punching bag for your irl problems.
---
It's actually the exact opposite on my server. The alliance are toxic in all neutral area.
---
Ah Barrens. Never change.
---
Older post, I know, but the CensusPlus addon is working again. [Here](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/)
---
Nice setup looks cozy! So what’s your binds for movement if you got skills bound to W?
---
I strafe using A and D and move around with my mouse
---
Spellpower does not affect wands. The only thing that affects wand DPS is agility, which technically improves crit on wand.  But, it's really dumb to go for agility, ever.
---
That's a good call. How are balanced servers going with the ganking?
---
&gt; This sub: “get your stupid self promotion out of here. I won’t click it because you might make a few pennies in ad revenue”
---
That's not specific to this sub, it's [Reddit's official policy site-wide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).
---
Also look at the top posts on a subreddit like /r/Comics. They're all from authors posting their own comics, but they're always re-uploaded to Reddit or a "neutral" image host like Imgur. They'd be downvoted or even (shadow)banned for "spamming" if they linked directly to their own sites too often.
---
Skeram!! We need alliance on skeram!
---
Yes, and they will continue until you accept it. This is how the internet works. Dont start something you cant finish. If someone proves you wrong, just agree and admit defeat. There is no shame in saying you were wrong. Its actually very nobile. I'm here for you.
---
I mean it’s kinda the most serious issue in the game currently. I think it’s worth discussions and solution seeking. My servers like 75/25 split lol. I can’t leave a main city without players literally camping outside waiting for people to leave. Last two times the UC to Org/grom gol Zep was on total lock, and the entrance to epl was also completely camped by dozens of alliance :/ how am I supposed to play the game at that point.
---
Oh hey, I'm in this. This was people trying to Get the UBRS buff. Don't run into a full raid group of the opposing faction lol
---
offheal is dumb, if the healers are oom so are the hybrids. They don't matter
---
Hahaha the high and mighty act isnt very becoming of you, keep to your true nature bud. Embrace the douche bag inside
---
You and me baby ain't nothing but mammal
---
&gt; and this almost didnt happen at all in P1
---
Now I KNOW you're fucking with me.
---
5-7k dps?!?! That’s nuts!!! I need a broken tooth ASAP.
---
With bgs, most of the rankers will move into battlegrounds, the problem occurs when imbalanced servers have 30+minute queues which leads to rankers roam arround high lvl zones and gank. It will be better, but ganking squads will be still here.
---
As some people said, the ZG times are great, you can easily pug three raids. Bwl is more challenging than Mc, so not every single guild will clear all the content.
---
Honestly, I haven't experienced post AQ experience, so I don't know.
---
So Germany must have conquered ru- wait wait a second! That never happened! Turns out the red army conquered Germany
---
- Get *real* gud
---
- Reroll PvE
---
- Pray BGs alleviate the situation
---
- Quit
---
Those are basically your options right now.
---
Yeah, just you. Thanks for being the first person to post about the issue!
---
All them legal drugs. Is that hemorrhoid cream? Sorry about your butt.
---
Most guilds will prio gear to tanks so it is, the impression i was getting from my research is that you didnt get a lot of upgrades from the raids coming out. (I dont remember the numbers dont quote me) theres only a handful of upgrades in mc and bwl, a lot of gear isnt replaced until AQ. I feel like this probably leads to a lot or getting geared early on and then having it all and being bored as you run raids every week for no chance at an upgrade. Playing other specs and having a lot more competion leads to a longer raid life before you have all the gear
---
I wonder how hell feel once he sees this amd realises hes wasted his time whinging
---
I'd go booty bay for either faction
---
Sweet baby Jesus
---
Aww it's ok man, let it out. I remembered the first time I got triggered on Reddit and didn't know what to do. It was very scary but I can promise you will get through it! We are all cheering for you.
---
I’m on a 65 hour a week work schedule between school and work, with no days off. Rerolling is just so hard to imagine. Before I server transferred I had freezing band at 48, and then I got underworld band and robes of insight to drop. Literally best start I’ve ever had to a character, then horde never joined the server, and now it’s a high pop that I can’t find dungeon groups on, every zone is camped or has us outnumbered severely. I basically quit at 52 a couple months ago. It’s such a shame.
---
Yeah? 
---
Why are they not banning the fifteen same bots I have seen botting all day every day for the past two weeks, I report them and tell everyone else to report them.
---
Nothing happens,
---
Because they don't care.
---
None of that bullshit "wave" garbage, I am making the report, there is no need to do it in a fucking wave, when a human input is the reason it is known.
---
Typically as the br1 premade, if there is someone breaking brackets and playing that much, you just invite him to the group and give your weakest link the boot.
---
Totem twisting enhance is essentially just having extra grace of air than just having a resto with enhance totem slotted in. You'd def have way more just 4 war w/ resto
---
Faerlina, Incendius, Benediction all very balanced. Incendius is especially fun. Horde very mildly outnumber ally, however ally is noticeably dominant on the server with regard to pvp.
---
Higher ranks of entangling roots have longer snare times. I'd use rank 1 when I know someone can escape or are unsure (trinket, gnome racial, mage blink up etc.) and a higher rank when you are sure they will be snared
---
I got No issues with it
---
what is there to enhance? you just drop totems alot and rest of the time you auto attack pretend to do stuff
---
They will be easy as fuck lol, 14 year old raid design
---
Yes that's why we are stocking up now. Flasks are generally not a necessity for most classes even on AQ and Naxx but tryhards like me who want to use them should be stocking up early, personally I got 21 flasks saved with a goal of 40 by the end of the year, but I like having goals otherwise the game gets boring.
---
Enhancement is about utility, not DPS, so...
---
Sometimes there are pools in ratchet as well as you can fish them in open water. Same with boot bay. The south eastern coast of stv often has oily black mouth as well as other fishes and floating wreckage’s.
---
Ratchet shoreline
---
Yea this is terrible advice. There are plenty of cheaper aoe damagers with engineering if you're only utility is to knock them out of stealth.
---
Yeah, I dont have time to re-roll either so I unsubbed a few days ago. Waiting to see if BGs help but I'm pessimistic. Its just a game man. If it's not fun anymore and you're not enjoying yourself, find something else to do. It's kinda sad, but that's just how it is, ya know?
---
Incendious horde here. This is true. We spend half the day fighting these fuckers from DM to winter spring. Took us a whole raid group to flush em out of both and they just came back an hour later.
---
Incendius 10/10
---
Im embraced for you, the bipolar way you swing back and forth is also a bit concerning
---
It was inconsistent as fuck in Vanilla.  Completely depended on server and even the same GM was inconsistent.  These "glory days" people remember are just nitpicked situations ignoring the reality.
---
Not saying it's good now, it's probably worse, but it wasn't incredible back then especially in the first months.  They had no idea what they were doing and no standard.
---
Got my only boe epic off those Naga to bad it was a lei of the Lillies :p
---
That how it currently is in classic, data digging suggests it was this way all the way into WotLK so it may be left alone as part of #nochanges.   
---
Abuse exploits early, abuse exploits often.
---
It's stupid easy to start.  You just need to help banish on Garr (should be assigned and explained to you prior to start of fight) and then just spam bolts or pretty much the rest of the raid.  You can tweak from there and improve on some fights, but don't worry about it.
---
GFPPs for Rag are probably the most important thing to bring.
---
Of all the meme formats that have come and gone, I like this one the best.
---
epic at bullshitting, sure.
---
I'm with you. You have to pre-use them and at least for random wPvP I'm not wasting those. I'll save them for crucial moments in BGs
---
Yes, it's confirmed as working this way. There is a forum post with video evidence and it's been discussed on Fightclub discord server, it appears to be blizzlike and therefore is unlikely to be fixed because #nochanges.
---
Oh, okay. It teleports you to the entrance without having to walk. That's the part I was missing, thanks
---
Are we having the same conversation?? I swear youre not actually reading but thats ok not everyone is literate, high school drop outs can still be contributing members of society, youre not but theres still time to learn. 
---
Oh a guy in your guild aye, let him know. My upbringing was actually very good, filled with love and laughs. Describe him yours though, he'll prob get a kick out of it.
---
Just logged.. now y'all gna make me jump back in..
---
&gt; Firstly, I don't expect to be like this once I hit 48 and I explained why. I was just pointing out that most people doing this are just doing it because there's nothing else to do in order to achieve frequent honor gains. Else they would have killed me a thousand times over with no gain if they were just "bad unethical people".
---
Not arguing that they're doing it for anything other than farming honor. I don't think any reasonable person is arguing that.
---
&gt;Secondly, how can you not see the justification when a player wants to rank up like everyone else wants to but can't consistently find anyone in the open world because they outnumber them by 7 to 3 and forced to resort to the most likely places they can constantly find people? It's just the natural course of action and its a design flaw.
---
I get why they're doing it, but I'm sayin if you decide to camp your players to the point where they can't play, don't complain that they're leaving.  Not 'you' as in you personally, but these guys telling their victims to be patient is bullshit.  "We'll let you play again once we have something better to do, like BG," is the proposition?
---
&gt;Even if those "unethical" people would start behave like you imagine, then they would just probably quit playing because there's no reason to play if you can't get your progress going in an mmorpg. So what if they stop camping hubs and only wait for you to be in open world? They will still vastly outnumber you, destroy you, then proceed to your "safe zone" where you will be cowered in because you're not stupid enough to go back in there and get hopelessly wiped out again and again. But guess what! "Safe zone" is not so safe after all with current 10k server caps and couple of 55 autoattack non-elite guards. So guess again what will naturally happen!
---
"You're going to be outnumbered anyway, so what's the point of us letting you play?"  Yeah, no that doesn't justify camping either.  Try again?  
---
&gt;On the other hand, if this continues at its current state, then people will also stop playing (which is happening) because its just unplayable for the ones on the receiving end and also boring for the other ones. Both scenarios end with the game dead.
---
Agreed.
---
&gt;Both scenarios are caused by the same design flaw in the game, yet you insist it's just bad people who are ruining the game and they should just ignore the reason they are playing it in order to save it (??) OK bro. I mean why even bother playing it in the first place?
---
Not arguing that there isn't a design flaw.  I could have told you that 20 years ago.  Anonymous, loosely or non-regulated open world pvp has always been a haven for the worst behavior.  This is worse because the system provides a competitive reward system (primary reason), no effective penalty system (secondary), and overpopulated &amp; skewed faction balance (tertiary) imo.  
---
The existence of a flawed system, being what it is, still doesn't justify camping player spawns. Go ahead and do it, you'll get your unearned honor points.  Justifying it doesn't work though.
---
 &gt;If the game dies is blizzard's fault. No legit measures to attempt balancing fore-known population ratios, no care to at least make it hard to camp hubs and FPs. You find it more logical for the whole gamers mindset to change (which will always try to find the easiest way to reach its goals) rather than changing a couple of things in the game to accommodate the issue.
---
&gt;Right.
---
I'm not expecting anyone to change.  MMORPGs with regulated wPvP have always been a breeding ground for the worst behavior.  People won't change, it needs to be regulated.  Even with a severe penalty system, there's still going to be a handful of sadistic players.  
---
**My point is that despite how you choose to behave, you're either part of the problem or you're not.  If you choose to group up with buddies and farm fellow players to the point where they can't play for weeks, go ahead, but don't bitch and complain that the server is suffering.  You've stripped yourself the straight-face right to complain about the consequences.  That's what I'm going on about.**  
---
Telling the victims to be patient and keep logging in so you can farm them is the biggest bag of bullshit.  Anyone who thinks that's a solution is an idiot.  I don't say that kind of thing often, but it demonstrates how short-sighted mob mentality is.
---
It increases your DPS by \~6 from easily obtainable alternatives. People really overstate how good it is for the amount of effort you need to put in for it. Doing it in an hour or two and gaining full value from all 7 levels requires you to have prepared in advance to do it, meaning you have to have all the mats ready, line up your leveling path to be in Ratchet at 30 for the quest, and have people on hand ready to help you. It really is not worth it in terms of **leveling speed**. Yes, it is not hard to do at all if you prepare for it, it is just not worth it if your goal is to level quickly.
---
They're talking about Searing Gorge.  Drop into the hole and run up the path on the other side.  Approach BRM from the east.  Will save you many deaths.
---
Imagine being the last Ally left on the server for a few weeks and getting free rank 14.
---
Sign me up!
---
No this is literally how insane the gap from mediocre player to bracket 1/2 is.
---
There's a reason they aren't separating the numbers to investors between retail and classic.  If they said how much revenue they are making from a game that is 15 years old versus their new expansion, it would probably look bad.
---
Can't figure out how to remove my minimap. Lol.
---
Where abouts in gnomer?? I got the punch card
---
I WANT THE MONEY LEBOWSKI!
---
Is there a Grid Mana Bars addon that works for Classic?
---
3edgy5me.
---
You’re up past your bedtime. Go to bed before you get grounded.
---
They look like dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Or cockroaches, depending on which faction you play.
---
You seem to know your stuff so let me throw out another question, are epic mounts BoE? Meaning I could level a nelf for quest rep, then feed him cloth from my 60, then trade it to an irl buddy and him trade it back to my main?
---
Horde flair checks out
---
Encourage more gameplay discussion. This is more of a Reddit issue though, large subs devolve into memes...
---
Eventually we can put 25 agility on it but I am not sure what to enchant it with right now
---
,
---
2 warriors, 30 warlocks, 8 paladins. Sons wouldn't be an issue, if you even made it that far.
---
There there, I'm sure you'll survive.
---
Haha so good! Honestly some of the best content I've ever seen on this sub
---
Whoa. I'm a 43 lock and just got an underworld band off a ZF drop. It sells for like 200g. Should I equip it or sell?
---
It doesn't apply to Swiftmend, but rather the HoT you consume. So the stronger the Rejuvenation or Regrowth is, the bigger the Swiftmend is. It always uses the full healing of the HoT, so Swiftmending when the HoT has 12 seconds left or 3 seconds, makes no difference.
---
It uses the +Healing from the druid casting Swiftmend, but the base values from the original HoT caster. A small note should be that "Improved Rejuvenation" and "Empowered Rejuvenation" does NOT work on these as that was not added until 2.0.1.
---
Well, being around people that are actually the "same level" 60is kinda FFA, you can't tell if they are fresh 60, one of the first to reach 60 or somewhere in between
---
Was in STV earlier and a dude was yelling about a gank squad in chat. Oh you mean these two mid 30s ally way too close to grom gol to escape with their lives? Yes, that gank squad.
---
That is literally how a PvE server works with flagging.
---
I thick that was in SatGeo Wild
---
Yep this is 100% the reason :)
---
Definitely still a viable build.  There's a duel tournament a bunch of streamers are taking part in and SL locks are dominating.
---
reddit bitching, forums bitching is probably the reason pvp servers were removed from retail.
---
Does the feeling of power excite you, or do you draw pleasure from the thought that you might be causing distress in others? Either way, you might want to take a hard look at yourself. I’m small does this behavior can be harmless, but it sounds like you may have real issues. 
---
Many of us don’t get all that upset when we’re camped. We know that the person on the other end may be a very sad individual to have to seek validation through a video game. We’ll just log off and return to our happy lives.
---
I don't believe spy really gives that much of an advantage so I don't think me watching the combat log really makes a difference anyway. I am a paladin though so I have a "reset fight" button anyway lol. 
---
It wasn't that hard reading the combat log. I see pink, there's horde nearby. Knowing class, eh, I /t anyway and know it straightaway from my unit frames. Is that an unfair advantage as well? What about my enemy cast bar addon? What about my swing timers do I can force crit reckoning procs? What about my rule of 5 countdown? My addon that puts my CD as giant number countdowns, and then the other one that lets me move a bar of abilities right in front of my face so I have high visibility into my CDs?
---
I feel like what you're essentially arguing for is no add-ons. I don't see how spy gives more or less benefit than the ones I mentioned (like, particular enemy cast bars, that one makes a HUGE difference for me. Guess how it knows which spell is being cast... Combat log lol). I could see that argument but I mean, the game's the game. I like to find every way to optimize possible. From my perspective, that's part of the game. Playing well isn't just hitting hammer of Justice at the right time, it's choosing the right gear and spending time grinding for it. It's choosing professions, levelling them. It's having trinkets and engineering items. It's having pots. It's grinding to have money to buy those things or make them. It's positioning, timing, movement. It's leveraging all aspects of the game UI to give me an edge - from knowing my enemy swing timers, to what spell they're casting, to how long that gouge will last on me, to when an enemy is nearby. It's learning about, writing, and implementing sick macros. It's learning class metas and matchups. 
---
So in short, leverage all aspects as well or I'm just a better player. I'm not going to cripple my gameplay because someone doesn't like one specific aspect of my optimization.
---
Only tanks and casters needs to flask, and they wont need it in BWL either, it should be easy, mostly mechanics.
---
Google -&gt; "classic wow *insert quest name* -&gt; comments
---
It's a pretty big difference, 20 spellpower more just with SoA, 33 in a about a week with AV.
---
But, you know, this is how classic loot works and not everyone is going to get a lockblade, plain and simple.
---
And I own Facebook. Bought it from Zuckercunt for 10 pesos
---
Are the useful yes, but only slightly they save you from triggering the GCD as others have said, I wouldn't go out of your way to farm them but since most locks farm demons for felcloth you usually have them on you anyways so why not use them. Basically it's a try hard trick that will very slightly boost your damage.
---
You’re the sort of person that uses sapper charges in duels probably.
---
No it's not, this is largely based on how organized you can be and if it was a massive problem people would band together in a social mmorpg like they are supposed to and solve it
---
‘queue &gt; HS &gt; farm honor for 40 minutes during queue &gt; enter BG and win in 20 mins &gt; queue &gt; HS’ would be the optimal scenario during a long queue
---
Yeah, honestly I just wonder how sad their lives must be.  I definitely don't think about OP having a great time in game...I think about how miserable of a time he's having IRL.
---
You can enchant +1% melee haste on head, legs and gloves, using [Arcanum of Rapidity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18329/arcanum-of-rapidity) and [Enchant Gloves: Minor Haste](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13948/enchant-gloves-minor-haste).
---
So I'll try to touch on the two major questions you asked, being "What are the upsides to the class" and "Is it always this much of a slog. "
---
Upsides to the class:
---
- PVE wise Prot warriors are the best tanks 
---
- Fury warriors are, imo, the most fun dps spec by leaps and bounds. Not only is the damage top tier but the rotation is way more engaging than most other classes. And you get to feel like an angry chainsaw with all the damage numbers flying around. 
---
- In small group pvp,  with pocket support, you are on a whole higher level of power compared to any other class. 
---
Will it always be a slog? Let's look at the drawbacks:
---
- Leveling can be harsh. Try to minimize this by keeping your weapon up to date and fighting mobs/doing quests that are 2-3 levels beneath you. If you can't find quests in that range it is (imo) worth grinding lower level mobs until that changes. 
---
- Solo pvp, or really any pvp without a pocket healer is going to feel really really bad.
---
- Expect to spend a lot of time being kited and rooted in pvp, even with pocket support
---
- While fury is fantastic in pve and arms is fantastic in pvp, they both respectively suck at the opposite side of the coin, so if you want to raid and pvp effectively you'll be respeccing frequently.
---
Okay buddy
---
Asshole
---
I admit I am wrong and mind blown. That's absolutely mind boggling. Something like 1700 regen ticks possible in phase 6
---
Farm mats for raid flasks and protection pots.  Farm gold for myself.  Help other guild members level/get their pre-raid gear.
---
Fairbanks needs you
---
oh yeah just quickly recruit 39 other people all able to make the same time.
---
Does someone please could give that man a staff and money so we can get a full 10 saisons series of his stuff?
---
Thank you.
---
Basically nothing left to do but farm honor or gold at that point. I've personally just been raid logging at this point and spending my gaming time on other games. The world pvp situation on my server has really taken the wind out of my sails.
---
The thing I always hated about horde, was that they were all hunched over. Until the belf came out and that's when I finally went horde. However nelfs look better imo so Ally I stay.
---
Uh... I’m not good with math, but I feel like 0.05 is not 50%.
---
Sm/ruin was easiest for me. Using the voidwalker to trigger her dust cloud and tank boulders made it almost impossible to die. Honestly though as long as you have minor speed on your boots and a nifty stopwatch trinket or swiftness potion on hand for oh shit moments you really shouldn't have a problem doing it as any spec.
---
Another ex-feral tank here, the problem is there is not much progression gear for bear tanks.
---
Is it worth saving epics from MC and ony to d/e when Nexus crystals come out?
---
Losing out on the 5% healing crit is bad for raiding.
---
Another Update: I forgot to add the Racial +5 Sword skill Bonus so this seems like a Game Changer.. if you're playing a Human Rogue Mirah's Song is still 3dps better. Question answered.
---
I've gotten a Huge Emerald and Arcane Crystal from a single swing, which I didn't think was possible.
---
it probably won't be replaced until raiding. I'm still wearing one
---
That is generally a farming build and I would guess he most likely respecs on raid day. Otherwise he does it for the +25% shadow damage, I don't think that's better then a either ruin spec but maybe he knows something I don't
---
“Classic” problems xdd
---
I dont get off on it if thats what youre asking.
---
Im also quite happy in life and in game so im glad we arent on bad terms.
---
Im not 14, my ingame behaviour isnt a release of angst i just enjoy killing players everyones got a hobby in game mine just happens to be more frowned apon.
---
Orcs can ride all the Horde mounts.
---
My fellow members of the Horde love it when I open a portal to Ironforge.
---
Sounds like some PvP is gonna happen on a PvP server.
---
Did that quest recently, I read some comments on wowhead saying the drop rate was obscene and I was like "cool, I'll just grind here for a while". Swear to God it dropped on the second mob.
---
It is, max Q's on normal days are 2-3hrs while on raid day its 3-5hrs. I just remote login, which makes things much easier.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Amen
---
funny. that's what I'm doing. lvl 19 twinking
---
What makes you say that? Servers statistics prove otherwise
---
Sometimes people waste time trying to make sure everyone is outside instead of resetting and going.
---
I see way more alliance gankers while leveling on kurinaxx. just my perspective
---
I'm sick of people trying to validate these idiots that rolled on the wrong server. I dont care how high leveled you are bite the bullet and reroll or suck it up.
---
Besides the main ganking areas I haven't noticed many ally besides the odd 5 stack ganking but then horde come take them out. So yeah I've noticed.
---
Benediction. 
---
Send a letter to Banksyalt through game mail and I’ll hook you up with a couple gold and some bags to get started, a guild with people leveling if you want it.
---
#nochanges for the doors in BWL, lol.
---
They drop demonic tunes too, so it’s frequented by 60 casters farming for raid consumes.
---
Have you tried it? Like it's not like the demand is there all the time, but I've got paid to tank before without much advertising.  Next time you see someone spamming for a tank for a while whisper them and say hey man I noticed you've been looking for a tank for a while, just wanted to let you know I'll ta k for you guys for (however much gold you want).   Lmk if you're interested.  
---
Yea sometimes you'll get people who are idiots and completely unreasonable, see op. But most of the time you get people who understand hey this guy doesnt need anything from here and a few gold from each party member really isnt much.
---
Nothing. Literally. Let the upvotes/downvotes speak for themselves.
---
I love her golden hat. Well done.
---
Always a positive side right.
---
Definitely not that kind of person, life is precious.
---
&gt; Mongoose.
---
do these stack with major agility?
---
I think Orcs can ride Orcs if then farm enough rep.
---
this clip was posted days ago. stop reposting
---
It is medium-high. It’s def larger than anything in vanilla was. Maybe a little too high for my taste, but not like the streamer servers.
---
Yeah, I like that it be popular. But rather not have to do the whole queue because I'm more of a casual player. Kind of not really.
---
Happy?
---
Keybindings are just for convenience and comfort. Whatever is comfortable for you &amp; gets your important casts in a quick place = good. Experiment and see what seems intuitive to you
---
Two things: the difference between a rare and an elite rare (one has a tail on the silver flare) and if you climb the hill behind the named mob (Garrick Padfoot?) in the northshire vineyards, you come out on top of jasperlode mine.
---
Not going to happen when horde have to wait 15 minutes + a Q... They'll just camp in the meantime.
---
engineering is a fun spec. They sure ruined professions in retail.
---
But if you move all the memes to a daily meme thread people will only be able to farm comment karma instead of the precious post karma!!!!11
---
For pvp servers, it limits exposure to the potentially unfriendly outside area.  A quick out and in for everyone is much less risky than standing around waiting for 5 people's varying load times and the leader to (likely) menu through the reset.
---
Is Toxic your character?
---
Essensece water patches in Azshara???🤔
---
Most popular bracket I figured it would have the best queue times
---
They'll go up to again. I finally started selling the larval acids I banked ahead for a decent profit.
---
Maybe for vanilla the first handful of times.
---
Gear is a solved problem now, and the average DPS will be much higher than it was then.
---
That wasnt my point. All I was saying was that warlocks have it much easier to solo anything than tanks do. They dont even have to buy a mount. Regardless, my point wasnt to bash warlocks or anything, just to say that this guys a dick to say I'm an ahole to ask for some gold to tank a dungeon that I need absolutely nothing in.  How many times has that warlock done dungeons that he didnt need anything in? (Not counting for guildies because I have no problem helping them out)  it's like he expects me to waste my time for nothing in return when he wouldn't.  That's all I was trying to say.  
---
He doesnt have to worry about making gold. Or rather he has to worry about it much less than I do.
---
Side note, it's good to bank rage for your next mob. Starting with a couple sunders &gt; killing this mob 1 attack faster
---
Earthfury is solid
---
Nope. But i am more than likely already on a few KoS lists.
---
Dormitory I believe near the mailbox
---
I play on sulfuras as alliance and I dont believe this for a second. It is constant camps at every single high level flight path, boat and bird by horse at most hours
---
..wake me up inside.
---
Sounds interesting. I would feel bad about going that deep into affliction without siphon life tho, since it feels like affliction has the weakest 10-20 talents
---
Did you miss the part where I said I do reserve the first orb when I do strat live and that's all I ask for from strat live and the majority of what my paid runs are for?
---
Bonus points. Probably a milf  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
this is a month old post but yeah escort runs are some of the best xp possible at 52-60
---
Nobody said it was a bet...
---
False. Black Lotus.
---
"Blank" implies absolutely zero content whatsoever. I doubt you genuinely believe that.
---
No, but they are better since they add crit.
---
I’m sure you are, but you’re a rogue. It’s not very challenging to camp rezzers. Are you afraid telling us who you are would make the game less fun for you?
---
Yeah, has more charges and slows even more.
---
yup took my strat live group nearly an hour to get into the dungeon because of the roaming death squads. Priests were mind controlling the warrior tank for so long he rage quit, so we had a to find a feral druid to stealth all the way to the instance after instantly dying at light hope.
---
A whole server farming the other faction for weeks literally never happened.
---
Read your posts. Pretty much what I expect from a rogue. I never said my class was better than yours. If anything I said the opposite. That a rogue was better than a tank at many things, the one thing a rogue isnt better at? Tanking. I dont even remember how we got to this point, but to get back on topic. Theres nothing wrong with me charging some gold for my time. It isnt even that much gold. But if you dont want to pay it then just keep waiting I guess.
---
I haven't played the game in years because I had thousands of hours in it. I reached Diamond in the open beta and Master in HotS, though.
---
Followed some guide while leveling and this quest wasn't that much of a hassle, just another quest. There are a lot of quests that are not worth doing in this game, but this one is not one of them.
---
Nah
---
Yes, and let your enchanter get an ony bag or 2 so they have room for it too
---
No but I got attuned this week I think.
---
Could I get the weakaura(s) you’re using for your energy and combo points? That looks really nice.
---
We got resto shamans totem twisting wf and tranq for the warriors. It's not about playing a a boring role, it is about wanting to optimize the raid.
---
People play the game for different reasons and that is totally fine
---
I do it the same way, its always made sense to me
---
What kind of toxic argument is that. Alliance are simply asking for transfers, which existed in 1.12. A significant portion will quit rather than reroll. You're not some PvP god just because you choose the right faction on the right server. You'd be complaining just as much if the tables were turned had you picked Heartseeker (where Horde gets farmed and QQs) as a server. Faction has nothing to do with it. Phase 2 is horrible for Classic viability.
---
So when you got attuned you definitely didn’t enter the swirling green portal in front of you as a shortcut to get out of the instance?
---
You say that but I still see full raids with less then 10k raid dps on golemagg. Bwl is gonna be a slap in the face for most guilds.
---
Great choice for 49.

---
Keep in mind there is some leeway with some of these items depending on what you want. You can play around with it if you want but if you made the twink exactly like this too you would still be a beast!
---
That may have happened. Does that really count as a raid lock though???? And I’m confused because it’s the exact same raid ID as my rogue that ran it earlier.
---
Who would've thought that the game would have an influx of activity then lose a big portion of players after a couple of months?
---
Everyone did. Including Blizzard.
---
Have a dedicated day where you allow memes. Like how r/imsorryjon allows non-Garfield posts on the weekend. Gives people a place to participate without flooding the subreddit with low effort content
---
What’s that stats addon called?
---
I do it on my hunter too. Wing clip + pet. FD by a node, shadowmeld from FD to wait on FD cooldown. Pop stealth with freezing trap on mob and whack away on the node
---
Would vary quite significantly across servers.
---
You don’t understand. This is my life.
---
While we are on it - I leveled a character to 60 with a specific Name / Gender / Class combination because the name was a pun.
---
It got filed for a namechange and now I don’t want to be a fem - orc anymore. In hindsight this idea was very stupid. Blizzard please fix this problem for me.. (/s)
---
Are there any US East PVP high pop servers that don't have a ridiculous population imbalance one way or another?
---
Seems like the debacle of free realm transfers lead to extremities in faction balance in either direction on virtually all high-pop PVP servers. Does anyone know of a US East PVP server (preferably high+ population) that has a reasonable faction imbalance? Obviously not asking for 50-50 but maybe something like 60-40?
---
The moment you zone into anyone else’s mc you are saved. I’m going to assume someone in the group was part of the same raid your rogue was in.
---
Let me guess your one of the 5,083,972 undead mages?
---
I'm not pvpping. I'm talking about when I'm just trying to get somewhere and get ganked by no less than 3 horde.  It's not like I'm going into pvp as a prot spec and then complaining I suck. I'm prot to tank because it's my favorite thing to do in the game. I have my side gear and weapons for when bgs come out, dont really want to waste money on respecs til then.  My point was just that this guy has no idea what it's like to try to do open world shit as a tank.  And as a rogue he has no idea wtf hes talking about.
---
Because I liked PvP in 2004-2005. I also have friends that I play with that wanted to roll PvP.

you mean hard like heroic?

&gt;So this might do absolutely nothing for some people
---
You are correct. I dont even care about the honor.
---
I bask in the tear collection. Everytime I come here, I see the anger rising.
---
What guides do you want?
---
There are detailed guides for everything. Dungeons, raids, gold farming, leveling, ...etc.
---
What interesting stuff do you want to see? Another guide on how to level a warrior? Or are you struggling with the intense mechanics in MC?
---
If you want game discussion, go to the daily questions thread.
---
Welcome to 2019 wow classic support. Outsourced, understaffed, and useless.
---
Yeah like the other person who asked, can you give a quick reply on what to look for in dellwood? Would be super appreciated!
---
Yes. Spam revenge everytime it's up tho
---
Please tell me where the alliance are doing this on ally-sided servers.
---
There's literally no equivalent for alliance to gank horde players like this.   
---
Every cross-continental mode of transport for horde-side is in "horde" territory at one end or the other.
---
Kargath is the place where literally any 60 horde will have their hearth
---
Every horde Flight Path either has a bunch of civilians in the town, or is in the middle of the town surrounded by guards.  
---
Help me. SOS. Honour dropped to only 20k/day :'(
---
Did it come decorated + lights like that?  That's a crazy good deal.
---
Also what's with the pharmacy!
---
Horizontal stripes... what a whore
---
Whats snapshotting?
---
Just makes it harder for one person to maintain a monopoly on a zone.
---
Preach.
---
preeeeetty sure they dont care.
---
Several guilds likely planned ony buff, hearthed to Kargath, and  ran to MC.
---
Except for the AV mount. Pretty sure Taurens can ride that one
---
Taurens can ride wolves skal.
---
I got ganked as a level 20 orc warrior by a 60 dwarf Paladin on Stalagg, so everyone who bitches about the dominant faction always ganking can suck my zugzug. I will attempt to kill every single alliance I come across as my rogue/warlock, no regrets
---
I like having as much inventory space as possible, and they aren’t hard to make, so i just make them as needed. If i use one, next mob i kill ill make another, so whats the point of having so many.
---
Can someone explain this comment to a dum person like me
---
Depends if you want stun or extra swing I guess
---
&gt; There’s too many people on these servers.
---
There are also too many people who dont like world pvp even if the servers would be 50% 50% even which would still be an issue if horde puts 90% of their players onto flightpaths and dungeon entrances and if you ask in general chat for the alliance to get a raid together everybody is like "i PlAy ThE gAmE fOr ThE pVe PoRtIoN oF tHe GaMe, I wAnT tO qUeSt AnD nOt PvP" so still people complain about how multiple flightpaths or dungeons are farmed by horde.
---
Alliance is sad I regret it so much rolling ally, way too many pussies on this faction.
---
Woah people have opinions!?!

You must not be on Atiesh. :P Shout out to the Horde who regularly get stomped by Alliance during world boss shenanigans.

What do you mean? Most classes either have fear immune abilities as warriors, trinkets that remove fear, racials that remove fear or fear ward. What's the point of even fearing in some scenarios lol
---
A gm literally disagreed and stopped people from doing it in SS a couple weeks ago.
---
So no.
---
Actually I do like the posts that theorycraft stuff. Those are probably my favourites. There are lots of guides on other platforms but they are not being advertised here or not posted here at all, which was my point.
---
You don't really need to flask at all in most raids, even retail.
---
Yeah, it helps, but it's not going to make or break a run unless you're seriously under geared or lacking basic skill.
---
The only time I ever flask is if we're trying for some competitive progression. Otherwise I can't be bothered.
---
Does libraM/arcanum of rapidity affect ranged? Thinking about haste for my hunter twink
---
This isn’t retail, you don’t need to flask until probably late naxx. The perception that you do has completely leaked from retail and is astonishing - this expectation alone is driving the price. Flasks are treated like dos pots in retail, the same isn’t true in clsssic.
---
I raided to naxx 4H back in vanilla and all of the modern efficiencies in rotation, gear choices and general player ability completely negate the need for flasks on “cutting edge” content probably until the last handful of bosses in naxx
---
Now however I’d you are going for server or world first clear then yes flasks are a necessary min-max to beat the crowd... but for ordinary progression, it shouldn’t be expected
---
This entire subreddit???
---
They are...

Yes, but the point is you can’t equip +healing, then equip the sword, then equip your tanking gear *and your shield*, which is a huge chunk of your mitigation
---
Can you confirm if the health reg scales with +healing and if it keeps the healing increase if you change gear?
---
Sorry to hear about your chapped lips bro, the cold will do that
---
I love how the people who act like assholes feel they are entitled to say "that's how i have fun in the game" but don't ever feel that people are entitled to be able to call them assholes for it.

What’s your budget and where do you live?
---
the statistics will overwhelm you. when you look at the overwhelming fact of HOW MANY HORDE are doing this same exact thing, the cons outweight the "pros" in your sense. Me complaining about the horde sounds like a pro to you, when it's a con to me. the problem lies in this simple fact.
---
No one's fucking doing anything about it. The line is still being crossed and you just crossed it. It's not about your selfish fucking wants. im willing to put up with the hordes bullshit , and others disagree and want to NOT TOLERATE it, which makes them bitches. im willing to deal with it.
---
But this is the issue im trying to make which you completely missed.

Why?

Tbh, I pity you.

It must be a boring life to live to spend majority of it on a video game and the rest of it trying to get under people’s skin.
---
You’re pathetic.
---
Its not exactly the Same but i use "Extended Character Stats" which looks similar.
---
Someone enlighten me here. I'm color blind, does the baron mount look any different to the undead epic mount?
---
Higher server population = more problems in the endgame with flightpoint campers etc. It's not just the faction balance but the server population that contributes to this problem.
---
Thank you
---
This would be amazingly fun.
---
This is exactly what av was supposed to be. World PvP on this level would have me staying up late so many nights that it would be unhealthy
---
I have done several scholo runs as a feral tank (probably 20) from 58 with crap gear to 60 with great tanking gear, essentially over-geared at this point. The worst run I have had is actually when I was my most geared. I had the biggest dumb as shit DPS I have ever had who just kept pulling and pulling. I wad amazed. Pull after pull, someone managed to aggro another guy. At one point, one guy aggro’ed another mob, I picked up the mob. That same fight just as we were finishing up, another mob was pulled, and then another. After three wipes, I just made up some excuse and left. The party leader (our healer) said he was never grouping with me. I felt bad for abandoning them. Something was fucking nutty though. I had never seen a group of people aggro so much.
---
Obviously they should have better guards - Horde use them too.
---
The private server no lifers will kill it. I'm just a noob who wanna explore the world and do some pug raiding. Like back in the days
---
What
---
Sorry they released the game I want which is why I’m playing. Sorry they didn’t release the game you wanted; maybe you should be the one moving on, instead of living in a delusional world that bends to your every whim :)
---
I assumed this was true, but two nights ago I looted the priest book from a dusty tome during my east farming (i'm a priest and have done the quest for the trinket book). I have seen the tomes give nothing before even when I do not have any books in my bank/inv, so the tomes just sometimes contain nothing.
---
Lol, spend 8 hrs a day in an office on a different computer please!!!!!
---
We would be mostly playing duo but even those few hours of solo warrior would probably be hell for him. My main is warlock so I don't want to make another, and I feel like druid might be too complicated for such a green player, unless you could convince me otherwise. Priest for sure would work but if he's not warrior than I don't think it would work so well. Thanks for the suggestions.
---
I always thought of its relevance as being that alliance could use it. It's honestly fairly unnoticeable to horde players running past
---
Latest Skeram concurrent online is less than 3.5k, which is less than vanilla server cap.
---
Bingo. I never took a dps warrior while I was getting up.
---
&gt; None of that bullshit "wave" garbage, I am making the report, there is no need to do it in a fucking wave, when a human input is the reason it is known.
---
"None of that 'this is the exact reason they dont ban instant bots' garbage because i am more interested in the conspiracy theory that blizz loves bots and never bans them than the facts that they always ban bots in waves"
---
Imagine being that kind of tool
---
Every single launch server was full, don't be a moron.
---
No it's not. You need to do Dungeons to get gear the bullies are still there every day
---
You think they care?
---
priest to support the hunters
---
You don't need a warning to get to this conclusion. People want honor and the only way to get it is gank or violate TOS.
---
Sounds alot like why the dark zone failed with division
---
Why are they sweaty tho?
---
roger. are they expensive to make or pretty standard? arcane elixirs are pretty cheap
---
All servers have more horde they will have to wait to queue on all realms ya dodo
---
Should've rolled horde soyboy /s
---
Yeah, ever notice how the people who want their speech protected are the ones who are shouting slurs at everyone who disagree with them?
---
It's the same thing with griefers in video games.  Less protections inherent in the system equals greater "freedom" to be complete assholes.
---
I know I will sound like a broken record to you due to everyone else saying it, but your guild honestly does not care. 
---
If your raid team has the correct amount of DPS and Healers and Tanks, there should not be any reason to be wiping as much. Please stop supplying your team with consumables, they are taking advantage of you and in the meantime they are not putting any effort into raiding. 
---
If I was you, I would gear check every last player, find out who is not in pre-raid BIS and call them out. Learning the fights is really easy, and players should be coming ready to raid. 200g a week is a ton of gold, you are spending nearly the equivalent of a raid BoE drop on your guild, whom don't seem to care. 
---
Teaching players how to play is one thing, but it sounds like you are working a full time job just to farm enough gold to keep supplying players who refuse to do it themselves.
---
Yes
---
I don't even have raid gear.
---
I'm PvP spec, but really it's just a lot of practice and knowing how to handle specific situations.
---
You get an edge for sure, but it's useless if you don't know how to use your class
---
With [Tome of Knowledge] being the only viable item to fill the OH slot, yes, keep your Warden Staff.
---
Or use the lack of decent weapon enchantments for druids and get an [Unyielding Maul](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18531/unyielding-maul) and apply a [Counterweight (3% Haste)] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6043/iron-counterweight) to it.
---
Depends on your server?  Plaguebloom is really cheap for me, but the Silversage can get a bit more pricey.
---
Fucking mobs are across the zone. Can't even quests without getting jumped by 2 or 3 of them.
---
Yo so this may interest you....the Runeblade benefits from +healing AND snapshots. Time to start farming your healing gear if you don't have it.  
---
 [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/runeblade-of-baron-rivendare/375231/21](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/runeblade-of-baron-rivendare/375231/21)
---
It snapshots. Broken LOL.
---
Dunno but this
---
https://youtu.be/n61G8w5DxPM
---
is still one of the best speedkills I've seen. The amount of frostbolts is mesmerizing.
---
So the Weapon has a passive effect on it that heals you for 20 (30?) hp every 5 seconds. 
---
But this passive effect scales fully with your +healing stat. So like if you look at Paladin tier gear (or plenty of other gear in the game), you'll notice it says stuff like "Increases your healing from spell and abilities by 46" or something like that.
---
However the passive effect of the weapon - the 20 hp every 5 seconds, also gets the benefit from this. So if you have +500 healing from all your gear combined, instead of having 20hp every 5 seconds of regeneration, you get 20 + 500, or 520 hp every 5 seconds. 
---
That's a lot of self healing that just passively happens.
---
This is what happens when Blizzard decides to open a brazilian realm 1 week after the launch...  The server was pretty much dead and i rerolled on Blaumeux. Meus pêsames.
---
Yep. Here's what I want to see: Every server that is above 10k population is cloned to two new, identical servers. Herod is gone and Herod-Clone-A and Herod-Clone-B are in its place. You now have two copies of your character.
---
Guilds choose which server they want to continue progressing on.
---
Effective server population is halved.
---
You get a bonus lvl 60 character on another server for your troubles.
---
Oh you don’t want cross server bg’s? Boohooo. Hey I can do it too.
---
The only thing that pisses me off to no end as a tank is when people walk in front of me before a pull. It irraitates me even more when it’s painfully obvious I am going to LOS pull. Like son, Sit your ass down. You have no idea where I want this pack pulled. This is my pull, you are all just here to support me. Now go stand in the back, follow where I go, and play your role somewhat coherently, and we will be fine.
---
it's not bis for holy paladins, thats just spreading misinformation.
---
The snapshot actually benefits from *buffs* as well. So be sure to get PI, Amp magic, etc. when snapshotting it! Flasking is probably worth, tbh.
---
That was great
---
Why the fuck would you play a war-based game and then complain about the warfare?
---
This is actually the correct response to stop me camping, You log the body disappears and i move on.
---
We're not. It's so frustrating
---
I know. I also tank in dualwield from time to time, if I trust the healer can keep up.
---
Check your messages
---
And all drop mounts as well (Baron warhorse and ZG panther/raptor)
---
That's just stupid. You saying choosing server on day one where nobody could tell if it's going to be balanced should be punished. 
---
There are thousands of people on your server. You won't even notice where they are coming from. And it doesn't matter as long as you kill them.
---
Me and my friend had a good laugh when we realized this. We both stayed very friendly with Allies until the Hillsbrad / STV zones - we avoided plenty of PvP but eventually it got too the point where Alliance would kill us every chance they got..
---
We are on a horde dominated server, so we definitely got more chances but if we got caught in an area with more Ally then Horde? Dead everytime.
---
So we said fuck it, and now we kill Alliance on sight. Zero regrets or remorse!
---
I have still to this day not been engaged in a clean 1v1 yet - they only bother when numbers are on their side so I have a suspicion if the roles were reversed they wouldn’t mind too much either..
---
I do think it is a problem if someone's sole pastime is WoW. Let's be honest, a lot of it is fairly mindless. Great stress relief though (unless you're on an imbalanced server).
---
Epic mounts are boe so if you have the rank 3 pvp discount/honoured discount you can save 10% + 10% by buying on that character. However to use the mount on a non-nelf character, you need the tiger training which requires exalted with darnassus anyway.
---
Yep, same. I will go through hell for my friends, and that includes P2 corpse hopping.
---
I played Horde vanilla and we were the underdogs - not like this, but it was real.
---
Just as many people rolled Horde as Alliance for the same reasons - aesthetics, zones, quest lines, class combos, play the other faction....
---
But the major pop differences comes from people who knew Hofde would have more people because of Horde racials and some minor bonuses - so they rolled Horde to get a numbers advantage and it created a positive feedback loop.
---
The more people seemed like they were rolling horde - the less people wanted to be on the “underdog alliance” and instead play ez mode.
---
Some of the honest ones admit it, it was a pure non/max meta decison. The rest say “PvP happened”.
---
Because those lists are sometimes based on private server data, often outdated and the meta game isn't conclusively explored yet. Be careful with guides and the BiS-lists they use. You never know how the author came up with his conclusion.
---
My reaction exactly lol lemme just enjoy my Classic WoW Forsaken pve plz
---
Adults are mature... now thats a statement most adults would disagree with lol.
---
I didn't play back in original classic, my guild is just saving some purples now for this reason
---
Lucky buggers, my guild has got zero caster weapons 4 weeks in a row.
---
Yeah. Overall it’s about equal. When you put in RP and PvE realms into the equation, which are all alliance-heavy. 
---
There’s tons of things that can be done - the most intuitive at this point being faction-specific queues. If the server only allowed 5k horde and alliance players on at any one point, then the problem is solved. It’d also incentivise the horde to move off of their PvE-PvP servers like Bigglesworth, Noggenfogger, Skeram or Stalagg and onto servers with other problems - most notably Heartseeker, where the horde currently get to have the alliance experience.
---
I was just thinking this today. Someone on WoW forums said Horde "deserve" to be punished by long que times when BGs come out. I'm just like... because we happened to enjoy Horde and some are playing the game exactly how they're allowed to?
---
Yeah it's more of an ebon or dark barely blue as opposed to purple
---
Yes, seems to be true. Maybe Reddit is not what I'm looking for. It's a personal preference I guess, the up voting system is there to give the audience a way to select what content is shown on top. Maybe I'm just a minority in this case.
---
That's exactly the point, these players are GRINDING like they think they are going for R14. EVERYTHING that you get isn't that important now, and could be postponed 1-2 weeks till BGs come out. But these people are spending 10-12hours per day pressing 1 button macro to get tags and hunt the opposite faction (alliance/horde doesn't matter whichever is the minority) to extinction. Is whatever you're grinding for that important that you think this is fun? It baffles me.
---
I tried some of this guides. They are all horse shit and not worth the effort. Kill easy shit in solitude, do quests, farm dungeons with competent players. That’s how you make money in the game without turning it into a job.
---
Thank you very much for the reply. The source for this is the testing and data collection of Magey. Is that correct?
---
Alliance 😢 I made my choice all those years ago n I never looked back since
---
Molten core and bwl Can be cleared by monkies in 3 hours. It's much easiee to get a raid set that rank10 set
---
&gt;so everyone who bitches about the dominant faction always ganking can suck my zugzug.
---
Thank you for brightening my otherwise dreary evening. Oh the hilarity...
---
I think AV spawns a black lotus?
---
Everyone?
---
its a waste if you're in a normal or casual guild, even gdkp. but if you're in a hardcore guild that likes to push sub-60 minute clear times and eventually wants to get to 30 minute MC speedruns, flasking isn't a waste at all. 
---
side benefit is it gets people "ready" for harder content when they need full world buffs, consumes/flasks etc etc....if its your first time doing all that in BWL or whatever its gonna be harder to "get used to" (especially the gold cost) than if you've been doing it every week-2 weeks for months.
---
But we don't have gnomes.
---
It's been fun playing against you Alliance PvE'rs. Horde is pretty outnumbered on Bloodsail and you guys are always occupying Org or especially TB... but TMvSS is really fun.
---
&gt; I’ve been rightfully spending the rest of the day finding new ways to tell this guy to fuck off.
---
But didn’t you just say you quit the game to be productive? Lol
---
Pre-p2. Check ironforgepro, a bit more accurate and current.
---
Kinda sad to see all the people leaving :((. I hope you come back when BGs come out!
---
Are you joking?
---
Honor calculations are done exactly this way. Find the total number of players with more than a certain number of HKs this week, supposedly 15 HKs. Say this is 7000.
---
Then rank players by their honor gained in the week. This is a simple sort. The hard part, if there is one, is calculating how much honor each player gained, because it requires keeping track of which players were killed and at what time. The actual sorting should be really fast. Just a short command in bash which generates 10,000 random numbers and sorts them:
---
 time ( i=0; while [ $i -lt 10000 ] ; do echo $RANDOM; i=$((i+1)); done |sort -n )
---
It takes 0.7 seconds to run, or 0.25 seconds if I take my 10-year-old laptop's CPUs off of power-saving mode. If actually written in a computer language it would be even faster.
---
This takes 0.9 seconds in power-saving mode:
---
 time ( i=0; while [ $i -lt 10000 ] ; do echo $RANDOM $i; i=$((i+1)); done |sort -n )
---
Anyway, say a player is standing 3100 out of 7000. That's 0.443. You do the same for the new server, and find the player closest to 0.443. If their honor is lower then you use the new value; if it's higher you use the old value. I'm just repeating the original post.
---
Whether you use the old value or the new value, you add it to what the player earned on the new server AFTER they transferred. That gives you the total, and you use the total for calculating standing and rank change.
---
Common thing to happen at Azshera FP as a horde player is a rogue will sap you then wait ~15-20 seconds before doing the stun lock combo to kill you. You get to sit there helpless and they get free honor most of the time.
---
I know a guy who has been actively playing since the release of vanilla, literally never skipped any content or expansions, has been in fairly hardcore raiding guilds the entire time. 
---
It's just his hobby and it's no more or less of a problem than any other... hobbies only become an issue when they start to negatively impact other areas of your life.
---
any rag tag group of people can kill rag no problem with no consumes. however, if you wanna spend 50 minutes in MC rather than 4 hours, consumes/flasks help quite a bit.
---
☹️
---
You don't even need to just be destro.  I bring my Succubus out any time I expect to be against Rogues or Warriors.  Seduce, get some distance, hit em with that improved curse of exhaustion and get the dots rolling.  Or you can give em a shadowbolt-shadowburn (if sm/ruin), re-seduce, give em another shadowbolt before rolling dots.
---
&gt; They absolutely are not. 
---
&gt; Only a titans would be needed
---
Just play on a pve server
---
While I do like this idea (just for the massive qq that would follow) I dont think it is a valid cure any more for the situation.
---
For no crossrealm BGs to have an effect on the populations the information of this happening should have come out in phase 1. People get constantly more attached to the guild friends and server overall. If this was common knowledge say a month ago we would have seen more people reroll.
---
Tbh I got my ass handed to me by a green hunter the other day to the point when he /laughed me I used my last few HP to /nod.
---
I’ve never fought a hunter on a mage before (oddly rare) and it’s a lot different than my rogue, Druid or priest from vanilla.
---
I’m still not 100% sure what to do other than maybe sheep the pet and work harder to dead zone him. The mana drain shot really recked me.
---
Why did u roll on a PvP server lol?
---
No, I like pvp servers. I was looking at ironforge.pro (I know it's not the best source, but it's at least something, considering nothing else has anything recent) and it looks like incendius, kromkrush, and sulfurus are the closest in balance. Any experience on any of those 3 servers?

Dwarf jokes make me uncomfortable. I’m a NE and spammed /silly with a Dwarf earlier today.

It's just speculation at this point

Would appreciate if you took a few minutes to read my thread regarding the issue.

Here's my suggestions if you're interested.

I'll be your new friend :-)  
---
Damn bro, nice moves!
---
This is such a dumb post and has been posted ad nauseam the past two weeks..it’s just a guild or two going to MC. Literally nothing of worth is happening here.
---
What did blizzard do wrong and how do you want them to fix it? Your post is 100% QQ and 0 help.
---
&gt; low effort
---
&gt; 10 paragraphs
---
mhh :p
---
Based on the ironforge website in the last two weeks. Incendius has a  big pop and a pretty good faction ratio, slightly horde favored. Depends if u want a big or smaller server population.
---
My guild is in the process of building a 2nd raid team but I'd voice my disagreement if we plan for a 3rd. Managing 3-4 raid teams just seems like a nightmare even if some of them are alts from the same people.
---
The problem is that raids will mix in lowbies to troll the other side.
---
Just need a fluid +honor decay/standing/xp/gold penalty for each point a faction is above 55% of the pop.
---
Once a faction is getting 50% weekly honor decay and it takes twice as much honor to push a rank, not to mention no one will want to roll if they are getting xp penalties, raiders getting annoyed over decreased Vendor Prices and nerfed gold drops, people will self deport.
---
Offer faction changes to low pop servers until they hit 55%. It will naturally smooth itself out.
---
Same here, but whenever I make that statement I always get "ThIs iSn'T vAniLLa ItS cLaSSiC yOu ShoUlD'vE kNoWN iT wOuLd Be lIkE tHiS"
---
&gt; BOOOHOOO that's what they get for rolling on a pre-dominated faction
---
There are valid reasons against crossrealm battlegrounds. You being salty is not one of them.
---
Why? There’s barely any anyway?
---
Most manchildren* would disagree with ;)
---
Kromcrush!
---
Yes please, I want dead servers as well.
---
It’s hard to find anywhere because sever pops are 3x the size and the world is 1x.
---
What’s wrong with the artwork?
---
UberRIP
---
it depends. are you going into raid with 40 people who are mostly/all pre-bis and BiS with enchants? then sure you don't NEED flask but it would still help clear times. if you're going into a raid with people with gear like that, you aren't really the type of guild to wipe that much and flasks would just be for efficiency, not needed to beat a timer. 
---
a lot of more casual guilds with little to no requirements for raids, some of their members not knowing what is "bis/pre-bis" and not, not the best geared/skilled people are gonna have a much harder time with even BWL and while flasks won't "save" them if they can't get the strats down or can't get the bosses past 80%, but a whole flask raided 100% can make up for the lack in good gear. think about it, a flask of supreme power is +150sp. that is HUGE. say a warlock is going into BWL with 298sp that +150 will make a huge difference, on top of greater arcane elixer/shadow wrath pots
---
Make an alt
---
As long as I'm above 50% mana I'm good to go. I'll call for drinks in chat when I'm truly low.    
---
As soon as I'm around 70% I'll tell the tank to start the next pull. By the time he needs a heal I'm up to 90-100%. Usually mages and warlock have issues with that speed due to bigger manapools. I tell them to "Keep drinking, I'll keep tanky McTankface up untill you're good to go."
---
As an experienced alliance player on a horde heavy realm, I was prepared for P2. Bank alts full of mats and well stocked in gold. Pretty much full BIS gear. I roll as part of a coordinated guild deathball.
---
In a direct sense, phase 2 is fine for me. 
---
Except it’s not. The whole reason classic is awesome is the friends you make along the way, and I’ve seen my friends list decimated. My bro is lvl55 and has 2 young kids, I’ve raided Naxx with him on pserver but can’t even bribe him to stay subbed in classic, and I don’t blame him. 
---
This story is being repeated thousands and thousands of times to the point where I’m not sure the damage can be reversed.
---
Suggestions? What for?
---
Lmaoo cry harder
---
We’re one of the more balanced servers - until you hit 60, and then it’s 70:30.
---
It could be way, way worse.
---
Tbh kinda glad I didn't sign up. If they do a BC expansion for classic I might have to get on board but I kinda thought this shit might happen. I came from a 3-4:1 H:A server (Blackwing Lair) back in the day, as alliance. Leveling in classic was awful but once Outland launched it was okay.
---
Keep doing what your doing! And 100% listen to these!
---
i meant you just play normal resto with imp totem talent and not twist totem. losing out grace of air is still fine. Shaman dps + 280 collextive agility is still alot less dmg than having another pure dps
---
So, pvp on a pvp realm?
---
People shouldn't be able to use memes as topic strters but they should be able to use them in comments. 
---
I'm getting tired of seeing the same "what is my purpose" &lt;insert meme spec answer&gt;. memes.
---
I was a lv50 Horde on Thunderfury when phase 2 hit, and the game turned to complete misery. Nonstop ally gank squads, literally every 2 minutes. FP's camped, quest givers camped, my corpse would get camped. I started leveling at 4-6am and that helped, but holy shit was the entire game frustrating and borderline unplayable. I'm normally a very patient player, and I was 1 gank away from rage unsubbing until bg's were out. 
---
I hear on some servers the horde imbalance is pretty bad, but this is definitely not an alliance-only problem.
---
Race: Undead
---
Class: Undead
---
Spec: Undead
---
I once had a 60 rogue follow me around zones when I was only in my 30s. They must have been spying on my account with an alt. Saddest thing I've ever experienced in a game.
---
No, the most recent queues I've experienced is weekends in the evening, usually a 5 to 10 minutes wait
---
Most wipes happen because the group tries to save time.
---
Just don't skip stuff that's not easily skippable. If it looks like it might be pulled, just pull it.
---
A wipe will cost more time than clearing any trash pack.
---
The PVP is voluntary. Everyone involved is prepared. It's better competition.
---
I'm quite looking forward to seeing a Survival hunter with a shaman-gear-swap in BGs..
---
Herod needs you
---
Sooo good
---
Felt the exact same. Switched to dual wield and had a much much better time.
---
Yup I've been curious about that as well. I'm especially curious what these people are doing because they don't make much honor from this and they certainly weren't doing it before honor. 
---
But I doubt you'll get an honest answer, I think genuine introspection from ppl like this is painful for them. Remember people will spend a hundred hours grinding the same mob just to get exalted with a rep. Having talk to one IRL about it they get immediately defensive about it. I'm guessing they don't want to think about it but at the time the game tricked them into some false sense of accomplishment.
---
What's also sad is it's caused irrevocable damage to the game. I think in a few weeks people are going to find the servers to consist of mostly raid guilds and queueing PVPers.
---
At least you are admitting it, you troll... probably an undead rogue
---
This. TBH, I'd get some offhand with stam for cheap and go for unyielding because I hate spending on boes that have a decent drop alternative
---
BGs almost here should be better by then
---
Or ya know, get better at the game?
---
Or make honorless kills DK’s.  Or DK’s for killing the same target x amount of times in x amount of time in the open world.
---
What's the reasoning behind this? Besides the fact that the boots would be incredibly expensive if not impossible to get, I'd be taking a loss in every single stat except fire resist.
---
Lol, if we had a long que, just means more time to farm flight points. You have the iq of a member of /r/wallstreetbets
---
What the actual fuck fuck fuck holy shit.
---
Literally **HOLY** shiiiiiiet
---
Look up the old battlegroup system :)
---
I watched this guide on youtube for reference:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxgvQWk9ozE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxgvQWk9ozE) 
---
In my opinion it's probably the best exp from 42 until 52 since you won't have to deal with horde. exp generally speaking can reach up to 80\~100k if you do it consistently.
---
Learning it might be quite hard though, the main difficult part is getting the leeway distance down and remember to backpaddle on Coc for maximum range. As for going in at 42 I suggest taking 3 stops with mount, as opposed to 2 since it is much more consistent at 42.
---
Good luck : )
---
What about people who leveled to 60 and then their server died? There are servers with literally less than 100 level 60s on it, what about them?
---
they also speed up clear time significantly if your guild is already geared/knows what they are doing. its nice to not spend 3 hours in MC or even 3 hours in MC and have to come back for 1-2 the next night to kill domo/rag lol
---
&gt;Arent elemental earths really easy to drop though?
---
I get about ten of them per hour whilst farming Maraudon. 
---
Once I get Rhok'delar, 12 minute runs with 3 Shrooms and two Elemental earths will be realistic.
---
The blasted lands enemies are invulnerable, that's why I recommend them.
---
So is golf, Netflix, etc. Find a hobby you like and enjoy it. We all die one day. I'll just go ahead and die doing what I found fun
---
I only kill night elf rogues if I see someone below my level.
---
Dw them like a true chad
---
The horde in the gank squads won't be getting r14, you don't get rank 14 by killing the occasional level 50 for 7 honor.
---
It made more sense two weeks ago when the zones were pretty full, but they are practically empty now.
---
seconded
---
Try being a Paladin...
---
 I will be the odd ball and say that objectively your considerations are right.
---
(I'm curious how many downvotes I get so I can understand how horde dominant this game is)
---
Im guessing the +5 weapon dmg is still the way to go. +7 is a 2-hand enchant
---
I'm trying to level on a PvP server where there's more Alliance than Horde (and I'm Horde).  So...I understand the pain.
---
I truly will never understand why level 60s just camp 30s and 40s.  I feel like those players don't realize they are harming the game as a whole when they do that.
---
Stop bitching
---
couldnt this be done with warrior then?
---
It's BIS according to warrior discord but I wouldn't worry about it unless you're in a super try hard guild. Eldrich are solid legs. Save your money for other things.
---
We usually let the tanks have 3-4 imps on them to have rage when she lands.  And then screamed at our dps for 3 weeks. Now its really smooth every time.
---
Why do so many alliance players have this mindset?
---
Ya I think I could have stomached it through phase 2 if I know they weren't going to fuck up BGs. Well that and it's sad to see the player base disappear so quickly.
---
I think cross realm BGs are the wrong choice because it ruins the community/social aspect of the game. You never see the same players and turns the game less into an mmo and more into something like a round based shooter
---
Good to know! At what point would it be good to leave ZF? and is it then Maraudon until I start doing BRD? Or should I swing by Sunken Tempel?
---
Imagine hating fun.
---
ironfoe for the flex
---
This buff is exclusively used by tanks only. Greater fire prot Pot is basically useless on a tank.
---
At 50 something i switched to fury + this. Solid spec
---
I have not, but I know that others have because them trying invariably starts a fight in /LookingForGroup.
---
Yup, any class that can equip a 2h sword.
---
You can snapshot using +healing gear of any type (eg, cloth) then swap to your normal gear (keeping the sword equipped) afterwards
---
Cool! I'm starting to get psyched to respec from enhancement :)
---
Imagine being op.

&gt; My day job of writing software allows me a few minutes here and there throughout my day to peruse reddit and tell losers to fuck off.

Alliance get a quest for an offhand with 50 armor and a shadow damage when struck proc iirc, but you are correct, warden staff is vastly superior.
---
I would almost list it for 300 and farm your unyielding maul, as the price is only going to go down as the few druids that will tank will pick it up and move on.
---
am going to continue playing but op is right
---
Cool!

Fiery

---
Funny, because I swear on benediction it’s the opposite, whenever we have even numbers the horde run and come back with a group 15. Talking like a good 5v5 at first, we die and Rez and try again. Kill them once and they come back with a Zerg of 15.
---
Why would you feed people like this? It is passive-aggressive nature they/we prey on. They do not get tired of it.
---
RAS?
---
Well, Atlasloot also showed the blue pvp sets to come out in P6 because that's when they were updated. :D
---
Atlasloot just corresponds patches to phases. The wsg leggings were originally released with 1.11, the Naxx patch, which translates to phase 6. But considering the r14 caster weapons, which were also released with 1.11 are available now, it's reasonable to assume all pvp gear is available immediately.
---
What he means is that bracket is unviable due to the difficulty of obtaining dungeon gear before you out-level it.
---
There is a large difference between being "ganked" and the stuff that has been posted from the most dense horde dominated pvp servers. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tUDAHVVIhY
---
It's fine on most servers for sure.
---
Incendius is pretty balanced, especially for a "full" realm
---
Skeram is pretty terrible to play for both.
---
"Ganked" was a portmanteau for "Gang Killed" and was only supposed to be used for when you get killed by multiple dudes. It then turned just any surprise assault since its just a great word. So in theory, OP's usage is correct. He was "Gang Killed" by a bunch of mobs.
---
We got 7 holy priests in our roster. Last person is about to get it when it drops..  And im sitting here still waiting for that onslaught belt to drop. Indeed eyes and leaf are easy to get..
---
At a certain point in time "GiTGuDnEwB" loses its meme/troll status and actually applies to the weeping masses. That time is now.  It's almost like all of the alliance players could continue to play alliance on PvE. My personal choice would be to organize bloodthirsty faction members worth their salt and retaliate. Find area's in which I could improve my battle strategy and never travel alone. The number of people to work to bring back an experience where socializing is encouraged and necessary for maximum fun/progression/immersion while refusing to band together is pathetic.
---
Where do you work that this is where the line is drawn for NSFW?  
---
Can't imagine a place where watching videos of video games at work is safe, unless it's directly related to your job or something.
---
I agree. I went straight for Bonebiter myself and skipped Whirlwind.
---
3 piece black dragonscale is (probably) only worth it if you can get the cape from the world boss with 1% hit
---
I wonder where that logic comes from. What if 3 people make 60k RP in the same week? Two of them don't get the rank and stay at 59999 RP for arbitrary reasons?
---
What’s this discord though
---
This guy is obviously level 47
---
Deleted my comment because I'm dumb and confused Mortal Strike with Heroic Strike, you're totally right
---
it's instant,but it's sometimes strange to aim and I find it easier if you stand still for a millisecond
---
the range and aoe is huge, the damage is negligible but the 5sec stun is the important part - it's a real stun not broken by damage like grenades and it lasts 5sec
---
all in all one of the best trinkets in the game imo
---
There's PvE servers.
---
Two-Manning is I guess too much effort.
---
Imagine acting tough and having to validate yourself over a game mode. I really hope you grow out of this phase..
---
That's what I have always told to the people who are being endless camped. It's Blizz's job to maintain the population baldance. And since they don't care and think a skewed server is fine then so be it. Players shouldn't pay extra price for Blizzard's fault.
---
Jump off the ship, pick a better friendly realm ,or roll PVE. My Ally alt was on a server with my friends. The server was fine in the beginning then there came streamers on the Horde side that brings in a lot players, the server ratio became H/A 2:1. We transfered as soon as we could. Even if there's no transfer service available. Rerolling a new charater won't take much time anyway. 1 months or 2 leveling time to 60,with the comfortable gameplay experience in the next 2, 3 years, that's quite a bargin.
---
Thx! Now that's a valid reason to it being great. But I assume I will become a frozen target in half a second again from their frostbolt? But avoiding one crit can ofc be the what changes the outcome of the fight.
---
Send your pet in to pull but don't let him actually get any attacks off. As long as he gets social aggro only and both bosses pull at the same time, the aggro will not be linked.
---
Devilsaur set is useful for the 2 set plus hit bonus. Of you have enough hit and the replacements make up the AP then you can skip them. You need to decide on tradeoff for a lack of AP. Edgemasters has no AP and Eldritch has a decrease in AP compared to the Devilsaur. So because you dont have the set you are missing out on a bit of hit and a considerable amount of AP so you need to decide whether the slight increase in crit is enough to not gimp your dps.
---
Nice excuse when your faction have 3:1 (75%/25%) advantage in every zone.
---
 * getting to BRD/UBRS/LBRS or MC (when you are late) is easy 9/10 times. Occasional you need to evade enemy raids,  but thouse rogues who camp BRM 24/7 would surely call several raids for assistance, letting you know when to wait 10 minutes before they zerg enemy raid with 3 of theirs. 
---
* Having Onyxia head, Dire Maul or other raid buffs? Well you won't have to fight for it because there would not be 2 enemy raids packed near MC entrance. 
---
* Gather materials for raid consumables or crafting in open world in high end zones is much easier. Even if you a PvE player, a healer for example, you can give info about someone from enemy faction farming on a spot and Honor farmers would make sure your competitors leave or get corpse camped.
---
* Your faction would never have PvE reqruiting problems. Vanilla is known for mandatory killing of raid bosses to aquire some BiS items that no honor farm can offer, so even PvP players would help you farm raid bosses. 
---
* * Enemy faction would first starve of PvE focused players, then new players as they start flocking to their faction dominated PvP or just PvE server, making it harder for PvP focused players to find raid spot without committing to PvE more that they would like to.
---
Literally did this quest yesterday and it took 15 minutes.
---
Why you asking Pserver kids?, they  turned out just as bad as Retail players.
---
Id love to though I’m on EU and I don’t want to leave the friends I’ve made on this server (Gehennas). :)
---
Appreciate the gesture though. ;p
---
Gaining aggro might me rough if you cant get hit tho
---
I’m incredibly bored as a horde player on a slightly horde positive server. Can’t mine, can’t fish, can’t gather mats I need for raids/gear, can’t really pvp, etc.
---
Farming is non existent, because while we may have more players than them by 5-10%, they’ve all realized this and travel in packs of 5 at least, so going into the open world to gather is suicide. You need to join a party or raid if you want to accomplish anything, but good luck finding a group to follow you around while you farm mats.
---
I enjoyed p1 pvp greatly. Might happen upon a small pack and hope backup comes while you fend of 2 players. You might end up in a 1v1, 2v2 or party vs party  combat at any time, but overall there wasn’t this constant threat of a 40 man raid around every corner. 
---
Then on the days where the alliance aren’t fighting back with numbers, there are hundreds of horde in every zone running around desperately picking off any individual player they see, which kills any feeling a threat, and makes for some crappy farming for gold out in the world with so many horde running around looking in every corner.
---
World pvp has gone from feeling like there was always a minor threat of pvp giving excitement to mundane tasks and organic wpvp on smaller scales, or even larger scales where it was big group vs big group, to reminding me of leveling in hellfire, except in this version fel reaver has 100% running speed and doesn’t make any noise until you’re already dead.
---
I don't see anything wrong with getting reinforcements if you can't handle sth. But on our server it's not that. They farm as groups of 5-10 or even as full raids and do nothing but run through all of plaguelands searing gorge and felwood and kill everything. Can't ever get a good 1v1 or 2v2 or even a 5v5
---
As a warlock: the hunters beat me on Shaz. Other than that, there’s only 1 or 2 mages in my guild come close to competing with me and one other lock in my guild (excluding melee). Though our other 2-3 locks are at the bottom of the meters.
---
Its so much better; had really issues with lucky weapon drops and ele was way better for me. Start in a city each log out and get some mage water. Collect that int / caster gear no matter if its cloth etc. Boom
---
I remember when i started playing everyone was saying if i didnt play on a pvp i wouldnt get the fully experience of the old classic pvp. Glad im on a pve server
---
eh, I often kill honourless targets unintentionally. i don't kill honourless targets intentionally, sometimes it is legitimately tough to tell if someone landed at the FP 30 seconds ago or 20 seconds ago. they don't all stay sapped for the same amount of time every time.
---
and before you say "why do you kill people who land at FPs at all", the unfortunate reality of the meta is that if I don't kill them the 5 horde behind me will. and if they hit first they get the honour, so I'm going to be hitting first. which is why you get the accidental honourless kills, everyone wants to be first to hit.
---
what is wrong with you?
---
horde do this at most neutral FPs in fairbanks
---
source: horde rogue
---
&gt; I have still to this day not been engaged in a clean 1v1 yet - they only bother when numbers are on their side so I have a suspicion if the roles were reversed they wouldn’t mind too much either..
---
The other day I waited for an Orc to finish drinking as I stood before him, then bowed to him. Then I kicked his ass.
---
He proceeded to respawn and try to gank me as I was fighting mobs.
---
Verner?
---
nah you just sap/sheep/cc the guy for 30 seconds until they give honour. that or if they fight back at all they immediately give honour.
---
Horde Warlock: What's the problem with the state of PvP?
---
I am a big Wpvp enthusiast. On my retail account from 5 years ago, I have 500k hks, and I would say 400k of those kills were outside bgs. I have no idea what some of these Horde players are doing, especially the ones on the low pop realms like Skeram and Herod. They are devoting hours a day competing with dozens of other people in zone to get mediocre honor, and all in some vain attempt to get a mediocre pvp set that they will probably never get the full 6 piece bonus because you know the vast majority of these players lack the resolve to even get to rank 9.
---
It honestly blows my mind. Like... As someone who loves ganking, the biggest turn off to me has always been waiting for 20 minutes to find some fresh blood.
---
it went the same way the retail sub went, just way faster
---
Are you Amish? And if so why are you on Reddit?
---
that would be exploited massively as one or more "civilians" would travel around with PVP gank squads, and when the enemy faction tries to engage PVP group they accidentally kill said civilians and destroy their own honour rating
---
there's a server for what you want, and it's called a PVE server where PVP only happens when both sides want it. on a PVP server it is one side opt in, as it should be.
---
s
---
ferals dont get chance on hit bonus from the trinket, so the dire maul north tribute trinket iwth 22 ap is better than hoj, also its less rare
---
Honor system in vanilla was never ment to hold populations of this size, and by the time honor was released back then most people didn't have 60s Rag wasn't being downed by guilds 3 times a week. It's a flawed system that worked out due to the lack of knowledge we have now. They also had events that promoted keeping a healthy populations for both factions. At this rate these heavily imbalanced pvp servers will become glorified pve servers for the majority faction that will never unlock AQ. If that's what you really want then don't blame the game when you can't pvp or progress in raiding for your inability to understand the game you're playing.
---
Tailoring's good for [Robe of the Void](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14153/robe-of-the-void) for Warlocks at 60, and can be dropped after you craft it. If you want an easy daily source of income, alchemy's the best for that. Get the life -&gt; earth transmute or undeath -&gt; water transmute and that gives you a profit of ~7g a day for an upfront cost of ~150g (life-&gt;earth) or ~14g a day for an upfront cost of ~700g (undeath-&gt;water).
---
Interesting I currently do option three but still die sometimes. I think they do use blade flurry though and that’s timer based. It must expire at some point I just don’t know when it starts and ends. I can only tell when it starts visually and have no idea when it ends.
---
Holy shit, we're former guildies, man!
---
F for The Brave Ones
---
Fab, thanks brother.
---
It won’t solve anything.
---
If anything it’ll make the problem that BGs are meant to alleviate worse.
---
Right now you can’t level in the world past 48 and sometimes even lower than that.
---
Imagine that compounded by bored bitter angry horde?
---
No thanks.
---
me as a horde player on blaumeux who is a healer and literally minds his own business and gets ganked by 10 rogues while trying to fish inside of a horde village. but really though this is why i give out free shit to leveling people and just carry people through dungeons to help level sometimes just to add more horde so that they can be busy fighting someone else so i can fish.
---
Im having loads of fun on pve, just saying

Why does it say Master under his name?
---
It's what my sister did with her kids, now they feel entitled to get something when the other one gets something.
---
I find your attempts to be somewhat clever amusing
---
Die, log off, log back on and rez
---
Continue until they fuck off because they get zero honour
---
There may be an opportunity there. Bring some of all the consumables with you and when someone asks for them mid raid you can sell them at a premium.  
---
In our guild if you dont bring fire protection pot for Rag you can buy from the guild bank (an officer brings extra every raid) but you pay market price plus 1g.
---
I think the only other key would be to tell your pet to stay in place when the fear drops so it gets killed far away from the group while you feign death.
---
I mean, I'm impressed at all, but I'm more perplexed with how they manage to do such poor DPS. Magi and warlocks have about the same coefficients, but magi get 6% hit for free. Hunters should also be stupid strong in this early part of raiding.
---
I always read here, that you have to Feel bad for playing Horde on a PVP Server... Meanwhile on Zandalar tribe... :|
---
Nightfin.
---
And 5-20 min chatdelay makes it hopless to pug anything atm so I’ve started playing other games instead of farming the last fee dungeons I need
---
yeah this isn’t a horde v. alliance thing, on my ~60-40 horde favoured server light’s hope/thorium point/ashzara are roamed by full groups of horde and ally typically can’t be bothered to make their own raid groups.
---
Thank you, I did not know if I should buy any Christmas decorations but now I know. I want this awesome mini Christmas tree
---
Get your people to stop camping the civilians.  It will literally be 30 horde to 15 alliance and yall retreat immediately.
---
Speaking of great weapons, high level green 2H maces and staves are tough to beat.
---
You can get a level 56 Fierce Mauler of the Tiger with 18agi/18str or 18agi/18stam or 28 str or 28 stam. This random green BOE is very tough to beat as a tanking weapon or a dps weapon.
---
For dps, your upgrades to an 18agi/18str 2H green weapon is Bonecrusher from DM quest right now, The Unstoppable Force from the AV exalted grind coming in 2 weeks, and that's it until phase 3.
---
For tanking, a green 2H weapon with either 28 stam or 18agi/18stam is tough to beat too, until you get your Undying Maul from DM north.
---
Spent 40 minutes with my group trying to get from the ferry to dm. But for every 10m we done we were killed 3 times by 4 separate horde kill squads who were alternating patrols between the road and the graveyard. Even if it's the same with alliance on other servers Imagine paying for that.
---
I did this but it was only up for 25g so I put it up for 20g sold within the hour
---
Ask ragnaros to open the door for you
---
can't wait to see what BWL attunement does to the morale of the remaining alliance guilds
---
this game is bleeding alliance players and players want them to rush out content as fast as possible. then what will they cry for once naxx is finished 3 months from now?
---
Yeah I hear you, it’s painful and we have it the same on a lot of days. I feel lucky though, because on Bene it’s like that w the horde but some days the alliance is all in their faces. So it’s not all bad, we get pay back every so often.
---
No one said that.
---
It’s just a matter of who gets bored first. 3-4 hours of hell. 
---
Never again.
---
For feral tanking Warden Staff is the undisputed BiS for the duration of Classic. Glad to hear you were able to obtain it at a reasonable price!
---
you don't have to meta game but if you join a serious guild then yes it is expected of you to meta game

---
Play a minority faction on an imbalanced server and you will understand.
---
Log off and back on just before you rez. 
---
You will get honourless debuff and they will either get zero honour or fuck off due to zero honour
---
Im on a server that’s pretty well balanced, maybe like 53/47 horde. The actual pvp battles between large raid groups are pretty even, but it defenitely feels like theres more small groups of alliance “gankers”
---
This took less than hour from first spawn.
---
I don't think it's cringe. If that's what they are about, it's whatever. Not really a big deal and it shouldn't bother people so much.
---
In my case, this username is something I created many years ago. I don't smoke much at all anymore and I don't particularly care enough to create an entirely new account just for Reddit.
---
uhhhh are you sure it works like that and not 3 layers of 3k each and remove layers as people quit to 2 layers of 3k each then 1 layer of 3k. Makes alot more sense
---
That's what I would assume if he didnt have the gold to pay the guy. I see hardcore pvpers do this shit all the time to bait people into duels with 10:1 payouts.
---
Bored of hearing this really.
---
What if i told you that 2% hit is more important than 0.3% increase to physical damage reduction in most instanced pve scenarios? 
---
Ergo Leather doesn't = yours
---
You need 2 seperate accounts or a friend.
---
Same steps, you delete it, they make one with the same name, you recover to a forced name change as your old one is taken.
---
As a general rule, any recommendations made by wowhead guides are terrible. That being said if you filter through and extract the various core mechanics/considerations (and then view them in isolation outside of the guide) the material serves as an acceptable reference point. It really doesn't take much to build your own foundational knowledge and (with that knowledge) just playing the game just a little bit solidify your understanding.
---
***
---
In the case of 16 debuffs slots, you're literally just trying to 'lock down' what debuffs are going to be applied and who is going to apply them, there's really not all that much to it other than understanding which 'debuff' is better given x options, and in most cases that's just a side-by-side comparison with a selection of the bigger number.
---
Yes it does, however Revenge is better Threat per Rage/Threat per GCD so prioritize that at all times.
---
If you're having additional rage to spend, also use Heroic Strike, which both benefits the DPS you're outputting as well as your threat, as there's a threat-modifier on it.
---
Changed my gaming completely on pc
---
The argument is that these people literally can't play though beyond corpse runs and sitting in capitals. My rogue is stuck at 53 because I can't quest without getting ganked by groups of 60s, and can't find groups willing to corpse run for 1 hour just to do a BRD arena run. Alliance just said log as of now.
---
Not on PVP servers
---
Gratz. See you on the battlefield :)
---
nO ChAnGeS
---
Well getting into Mara or ZF is still relatively easy (on Gandling at least) but as a lvl 52 I am starting to get less and less xp..
---
The real bad servers like Herod or Skeram or around 70/30 population imbalance and Skeram is shifting towards 80/20 now. Even banding together they still have 3v1 or 4v1 odds.
---
Embrace the grind. Quit questing.
---
I was once running through stonetalon as an alliance rogue level 30ish and a 60 troll priest tells me to /wait. He mind controls me then casts pw:fort on me and we continue on our merry ways.
---
Cheapest would be to remote into your home PC from your work PC. Either that or a tablet with Bluetooth keyboard/mouse.
---
I was downvoted to shit for being anti-layering for this exact reason, even referring to a clip of the WoW Dev from Vanilla stating server caps were a very intentional design decision unrelated to technical limitations. It avoided people becoming a face in a crowd, which is one of the reasons people liked the idea of Classic "reputation mattered"
---
I am well aware that this is not the best course of action but I am not Blizzard. I simply state how it is and nothing else.
---
if the hunter moves away while the pet is fighting (probably pvp outside of Ony) it despawns the pet when the hunter is out of range. When that happens it stores all effects, dots etc on the pet for when it is resummoned.
---
Happens a lot in pvp that the pet gets feared and thanks to dash it runs into the distance and despawns. When immediately resummoned, it will also immediately run away in fear again.
---
In this case, the fear was still stored and pets tend to have the greatest pleasure in running straight to an enemy mob, boss or mob group.
---
I'm the MT, so I'm usualy assigned to the last target that dies.
---
On r/buildapsales there is a lenevo lap top for 300 that would be perfect I would get it if I had the money good processor and one of the best interested graphics.
---
i am running as feral ot and dps currently, have my bis dps set and quite decent armor set for tanking. around 8,4k armor unbuffed. i can do top 10 dps with my feral set (sometimes top5 when using pummers and dont mess up the rotation) and when needed then ill switch over and just change my armor equiped. i currently run this talent setup
---

---
there are not many items for bear tank, only rings,amulet, shoulders, wrist and sounds about it. most bis are from quests, 45-60 dungeons and crafted stuff
---
get your armor rings by questing, i skipped those and pain in ass to do them at lvl 60 again. Also level your enchant to 265 for trinket.
---
I dont see your argument here. Why is it that more people clearing raids = more pvp? No system is perfect but, how is it flawed due to our knowledge now? Wasnt this information always available, at least for a good portion of Vanillas lifespan? If you clicked on a high pop pvp server you should've buckled up
---
L2P
---
2nd time I've herd the word warmode. Is that retails version of pvp flagged?  Can you not gank anymore in retail?  (haven't played retail since cata)
---
The cost really depends on your server, MC is fundamentally pug-able but that just leaves an element of chance. If you were getting the lobotomizer you'd still have to a spend a number of hours grinding out the reputation (as I said, that's not really hard in and of itself). If you could farm 50g/hour and it took you 10 hours to do AV reputation then that's potentially 500g (equivalency) you could buy the Perdition's Blade for and not be at a loss. Any guild who is capable of 'selling' loot most likely doesn't need it and is pretty much speed clearing MC to begin with so it's just a question of 'chance' as to whether the dagger drops or not when they sub you into the raid (for the rag kill).
---
If you could farm 50g/hour (and this is really not hard to do, even on a Rogue) then 20 hours is 1,000g (which, ignoring discounts is essentially an epic mount for someone). Looking at this from a 'cost' point of view is a flawed perspective to take though. I'm sure you can do this yourself so just 'lookup' how much better a Perdition's Blade is compared to the Lobotomizer, how many other daggers are better than a Perd's (and how you would get said weapons) and you'll find very few actual upgrades.
---
Yes on pvp servers
---
Yes! It's gorgeous. That's one thing I truly miss about phase 1, was the good times flirting with the other side.
---
I'm not sure this game is thought out
---
Dear Blizzard
---
Please change the game from how it was originally desgined cause your game makes me mad.
---
PS. I hate you for being bought out by a company that makes no descisions regarding said game im angry about.
---
Never understood "push through it to 60" I will let you take a wild guess what changes at 60. Nothing. You still have to go to the dungeon and let me tell you just because you are 60 the other side won't be scared of you. Where do people get this idea that once you are 60 the horrors stop lol. They just began.
---
Let's pray for bgs
---
Braindead ally keeps feeding horde 1 by 1.
---
Right, but people share what directly affects them. 
---
It's easy to jump on and complain about their 32 deaths getting to BRM and the no-lifer horde performing these atrocities, but a lot harder to show the same passion to contemplate the theoretical no-lifer alliance doing the same thing on a reversed-ratio server they don't play on.
---
not talking about the paid one at wow-fishbot. I'm talking about the old version at [fishbot.net](https://fishbot.net) that hasn't had any updates in years.  I really just want it to run for 20 min while I take kids to school, etc. It's open source on the page, just don't know what do do with it.
---
this will just mean the cities will be camped, so no you will not be in a bg smbc you wont be queuing.
---
I think that's the most on spot answer to this thread
---
I love playing alliance on Shazzrah honestly.
---
You can make a pvp group and literally go anywhere in the world and farm honor.
---
Shout out to our hordies &lt;3
---
Are they crying as well?
---
For sure. They are waiting out bgs and If things don't improve they will do something for sure. People are quitting fast right now
---
Why is 3k considered high-pop in 2004 and suddenly a ghost-town in 2019?
---
Just because you want to play on an insanely bloated, overcrowded server doesn't make the normal ones a ghost town.
---
You don't really need to aim for pools, you fish them enough in open water, even in low level zones.
---
So bored of people harping on about how easy everything is. It isnt that easy, stop spouting your shit, there is a reason Naxx was originally only cleared by a handful of guilds, and that is in part because it was actually fairly challenging.
---
Pro Tipp: Die in the eggs, if you get kicked in...
---
CC is slow. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.     
---
Smooth is where it's at. Smooth means less damage taken, means less heals needed, means less manabreaks for the healers, means we can keep going longer which speeds up the entire process.

**&lt;ZANCOR&gt;[HORDE][FAIRBANKS-PVP][SEMI-HARDCORE RAIDING][PST]**
---
10/10 MC +Onyxia. [First Hand of Ragnaros wielders for Fairbanks Horde side.](https://i.imgur.com/qLJhyx8.png) 
---
**We are recruiting to fill out key spots in our 2 raid teams and to have a few members on reserve. So that people can take a week off if need be.**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Who are we?**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you’ll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We’re about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we’re not improving, then we’re not doing our job.
---
Our leadership team comes from a wide range of play styles. Both guild leaders are Eve online veterans holding leadership positions in large alliances, as well as being seasoned top tier raiders in nearly every expansion in WoW. One of our most notable highlights is being members of a world first Star Wars the Old Republic raid team. We're here to expand upon that experience and pass it along to other players.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**
---
 &amp;nbsp;
---
First and foremost ...we’re a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We’re not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren’t for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don’t care if you’re new to classic, as long as you’ve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
 We begin forming at 8pm server time. 
---
Tuesday, Wednesday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday and Thursday(Optional cleanup AKA “The Chungus Raid”) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 4 patch.Onyxia is done the next closest raid day after reset.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don’t need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you’ll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we’ve done this before… Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We use EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each raid to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
**What are you looking for?:**
---
**High Priority:**Resto Shaman++, Warlocks+++, Tanks(Ability to run fury prot++), Fury Warriors+ 
---
**Mid Priority:**Mages, Rogues
---
**Low Priority:** Enhance Shaman, Shadow Priest, Hunters, Priests, Druids
---
*Exceptional players of any class are encouraged to apply regardless of class priority need. Raid spots are not set in stone and can be contested.*
---
**That sounds great! Where can I sign up?**
---
You can start with telling us a little about yourself [here!](https://forms.gle/cRucWvvKFSCrFDCb9)
---
You can also visit our discord if you have any questions. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/PC9TQv4)
---
This.
---
Free Rawdogg
---
Yeah, because Yang Gang on Incendius (H) isn't totally 2-raid camping both BRM entrances and MC's 24/7 even when they no longer give honor. No sir.
---
I've helped hordies quest just to have them turn on me as soon as some asshole undead 3 levels higher rides by and starts attacking, so they had no intention of PvPing unless a victory was secured in the shittiest way. Mind you this was on release, not even for honor gains.
---
Horde or alliance people are gonna be assholes. Period. What i am gonna tell you from my years of experience is that horde players like to feel dominant no matter the situation and allies love taking revenge in the most excessive way possible.
---
lol blizz would be suicidal to make any more controversy for a long while
---
Also fuck Npotential
---
Ah yes, choosing where I want to spend my money is now “crying”.  You can’t be older than 12 and if you are you need therapy for being emotionally stunted.
---
it’s interesting that that happens in your server despite being outnumbered though—i always assumed it was a case of more people being online=more people to convince to come gank raid, plus horde are typically the pvp faction so probably more people willing to join in. i wonder what it is about your server that would compel lower pop alliance to group together. probably just comes down to who the players are i guess; a few strong pvpers could probably rally people together anywhere.
---
That's how most business operate.
---
I play WoW, have a family and I work.
---
You can get a dungeon done every couple of days and maybe some light leveling. You can also clear up like 3 hours for raiding once a week.
---
WoW is only time consuming if you set demanding targets on yourself. This game will be frozen in time for years. No need to rush anything.
---
Once my hunter reached 60 and my guild started raiding, I log on to raid once a week, or I log on to level my Warrior or Paladin. I consume the rested bars on each then leave them a few days.
---
WoW can be a casual game if you set long-term achievable targets.
---
You can set it up via Grid2 itself without any other add-ons. Should be "power bar" or something like that, but look it up from the murlocparliament website.
---
&gt;I don't see anything wrong with getting reinforcements if you can't handle sth
---
So you're saying if it's 5v5 its a good idea to get a zerg when your group is to trash to win in an equal fight? Yeah that's quality pvp right there
---
You had tanaris and zf 😁
---
You buff warriors and Casters.
---
*Unless you're in a less serious guild because this amount of min-max is not necessary by 99% of the remaining population.
---
Fair point really. Actiblizz doesn't care about anything except $$.
---
I've been playing since bc and I've had the exact opposite experience but I guess you are right. People gonna be assholes no matter what.
---
Lmfao
---
Whoosh
---
I've had mixxed experiences but mostly never had issues with the tank going too fast (or if they did a single "please give me manabreak" was enough for the break I needed).    
---
The only real issues I've had were with DPS who took offence to a healer needing mana to be able to heal.
---
i think lowbie gankers are typically trolls who don’t care about a fair fight and want to ruin someone’s day. the same people who enjoy griefing kids on minecraft or whatever. they don’t care about the health of the game.
---
Not sure if funny or doesn't understand
---
Eldritch no doubt
---
Just wait for the double arcane chrystal node.  Had it happen  twice and it was amazintg
---
you are right its freaky i guess valdihr is on to something with this lady.   Think about the ingredients she got in that stew,  no human would eat that.  Probably some burning legion demon in disguise
---
Yeah you go get some reinforcements yourself and you got a huge battle that's amazing in my mind. But I know that's unlikely to happen for a lot of people.
---
All this thread does is make me hope they open paid pvp to pve xfers asap.
---
Hard like heroic more than you can handle so let’s do it like a Druid in the general channel...
---
It's not a dumb question. Not all BGs will be premades- especially in the beginning. But I would get used to the feeling of zoning into a BG and getting that sinking feeling when you realise it's a premade. And likewise the "dis gon be gud" feeling when it's a fair fight.
---
On private servers, I'd say 60-70% of the BGs I joined was a premade. It wasn't fun. But this is much higher population than pservers, so I don't think it'll be that high.
---
Let me be as clear as i can be
---
1. Run up to the ledge where you will be parking your pet
---
2. Cast eye of the beast, and run your pet in front of the boss
---
3. And here comes the important bit. **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER, SHALL THE PET DEAL ANY DAMAGE TO EITHER BOSS**
---
4. Once the boss has aggroed your pet. WITHOUT YOUR PET HAVING DEALT ANY DAMAGE! You send the pet to you, causing the pet to run out of range
---
5. Park the pet, and approach the encounter as you would. At this point, your pet can be used to deal damage to the boss or to bait out charge and/or cast to give your more time to deal damage and/or viper sting.
---
I just tried it, i have two accounts on seperate battlenets and i was able to take the name the second i hit delete. I didn't recover it whilst the name was taken though as there's 14 days between recoveries and i want it on account 1, but i was able to take it straight away on account 2.
---
Just speaking from my perspective. It's undoubtedly biased because you'd be hard pressed to find a WoW Classic player who spends equal time at end game on both sides.. All I can say is I'm happy it's you not me, cause I'd doubt you or many Ally would give a fuck if it was my problem. That's all I'm saying.
---
Lol, 2 60s and your JUST NOW figuring this out. Smh.
---
I think if bgs dropped the same time as honor it would have helped but it only increased the server imbalance. If blizz doesn't fix that the game will remain unplayable even with bgs.
---
Azshara is my tip for grinding - remote, not many players there at any time and the mobs respawn fast. You could grind there until 60 and make some money, too
---
Not true, I always have my pet attack crom on pull and never had any issues with them being linked.
---
But the time you can reach weapon spec talents you will have pretty good access to swords from dungeons, arguably better than to other weapon types.
---
3:1 ratio certainly doesn’t hurt.
---
Actually I am on a slightly alliance skewed server so it's not my problem either
---
I have been tracking the numbers on [IronForge.pro](https://ironforge.pro/servers/) since Horde was still around 60% and you're wrong.
---
Looking at the responses I am glad I quit. Like the amount of joy people get from ruining other peoples experience is really disgusting. You did it Horde, I quit Classic WoW. Now you can play by yourselves.
---
every single day world and trade chat is filled with ragequit posts like "I'm done with classic until BGs come out"
---
Besides the advice here of doing things a little lower level, the only other advice I can offer is to find a healer friend. Find a healer and make that guy your best friend. Add him to your friends list, play with him whenever you're both on. A warrior by himself cant do much, a warrior with a priest can take on an army.
---
Best male cackle, best male dance, fight me.
---
Male humans still have the best joke, though, so I always have Savory Deviate Delights for when I want to hear about Azeroth's Lord of the Bracelet.
---
You and me baby more than they can handle so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel!
---
its only been 10 days? my god
---
Yes. Your auto shot resets normally while you aimed shot.
---
&gt; The thing is way too many people truly believe they can at least gain the epic set, while they will never even complete the blue set.
---
it's like too many people trying to fit through a doorway all at once
---
nerds thinking that casually farming 2-3 hours a day is going to get them rank 14 before christmas are fucking delusional, the current rank one alliance pvper on my server is a neet who plays upwards of 12 hours a day
---
the intelligent thing to do would be to wait for people like him to get bored and decay, saving your effort and being realistic
---
but nobody ever accused wow players of being intelligent so
---
&gt; The scale precluded the formation of solid communities
---
Actually, I think a lot of servers formed pretty strong communities, which is why we are seeing so many well organised pvp raid groups.  What the game absolutely does not do, however, is form any sort of community cross-faction.  Those red nameplates need to die.
---
You're half right. I picked Horde because I love the faction. I picked troll because guide said it's the best race for hunter.
---
&gt;At this pace nobody will get to experience naxx again
---
I don't even get to experience leveling right now. So what the fuck do you want me to do? I'm bored of MC/Ony and get camped trying to play the game doing anything else. I have quit until new content comes out.
---
No fight punishes melee atm
---
It's OK for some weeks or a month, after that you need to find something else that won't break your body. This isn't sports.
---
Nah. Everyone in the zone gets put in combat when you engage a raid boss.
---
you must have missed the memo that the games used to hate its players back in the day, your story is absolutelly normals ant its the reason everyone wanted the classic servers. Oh and this is a much easier version of the game than what it launched like
---
I think we're getting whoooshed
---
Acknowledge trends sooner and sticky them. For example, make a sticky for "P2 venting" and delete every other post.
---
Severe lack of trinkets as well. PVP rogue with... 4 combat trinkets? oh come on that's just nowhere near enough.
---
Right. I waste about 20 minutes on corpse running as a druid healer with untalented stealth. Rogues are on chains, balconies spot where you land to shortcut jump to BRD, and they camp both searing gore and burning steppes entrances, sometimes with 2 hunters throwing flares on CD.
---
None stealth classes die about 6-11 times and we are lucky if our group wastes 40 minutes just to travel from flight point to instance entrance.
---
Add time to look for a new tank if previous rage quits and you can have as long as 60 minutes gone if something leads to a wipe inside dungeon. So you are limited to 2-3 instance runs a day instead of 4-5 runs + time for relaxed grinding of mats and gold.
---
Phase 3 would make all players reroll/transfer to their faction dominating PvP or PvE servers.
---
Last I was in Everlook was 2 days ago, and there were about 10 alliance camping outside the city walls ganking anyone who left the city. You couldn't even make it to the flight path. 
---
Honestly I think the game is just miserable for anyone 50-59 right now. It's impossible to level anywhere during primetime.
---
From my own census scans, it is by far the most promising server.
---
Near perfect faction balance with 3-4 good guilds on each faction.
---
Still no real cross faction diplomacy and the economy is doing ok. Alliance may have slighty more bankers so its a bit more expensive on their side.
---
You don't play on a busy server. Yes you can attribute it to burnout, but seeing some of the videos where the Horde just controls BRM forever, why bother? I would find the slog of corpse running more palatable if there wasn't just super boring MC/Ony to run to. Give me BWL or I am not playing this game.
---
Brd. Tell people you're new. Even if it's a lie how will they know? Just tell them you're new, ask for advice. Do that until you know the dungeon. Itll only take like a run or 2.
---
I was too sicked I guss
---
r14 gear also wasn't worth grinding that hard for before battlegrounds came out
---
&gt; What is the upside to this class? 
---
it's the best scaling class in the game, when you're decked out in epics you're undisputed king of dps - it just takes a long time to get there
---
What about when soloing?
---
Honestly I'm having a hard time imagining how he can be killed without both with his dots and mana drain.
---
Had some nice 1v1’s with the horde. But the death balls are really annoying. Small skirmish pvp turns into a zergfest when 30+ hordes show up, or vice versa. 
---
Still, I can herb some and the death balls keep moving, so avoiding them is doable.
---
This checks out. 3g96s for a 6600xp q.
---
What was your class and what was his?
---
&gt;The thing people never talk about
---
There's some variation of this post in literally every thread like this, often times multiple, and has been since months before classic's release to combat the min-max private server boogeyman
---
Imagine being this obtuse and dense.
---
Why do they cost 18 gold then?
---
 The memes are really stale...I reckon some cool shit might pop up after BGs get released :D
---
Yep
---
You should fish for essence of water in Azshara
---
Hard casting shadowbolt during large scale pvp is not optimal. Instead you could be applying three DoT's to 10-15+ people during a large-scale engagement. If you're worried about them dispelling then you can bait the dispels by downranking and wasting their mana. If you're hardcasting shadowbolt you're completely immobile. My guess is you're probably just camping flight paths with no serious opposition in sight.
---
Hello fellow bigglebro. I’m only 45 at the moment but I’ll join your ranks when I’m 60 soon
---
They already did. BGs are coming on the 10th.
---
Don't forget that the CEO of Blizz is the "*you think you do but you don't*" guy. All the whining is probably making him laugh out loud and just shout his favourite phrase alone in his office.
---
I highly agree with the reputation not mattering at all in Classic. My server is 20% Horde and even here we're too overcrowded for reputation to matter.
---
Demand is way higher?
---
I like the nipple for my sap target.
---
Youd have to be some kind of traitor to sell a rare pvp weapon in the neutral ah....
---
Because of the boss mechanics of the first 2 fights especially which require a lot more coordination and individual efforts from everyone, NOT because of lack of dps.
---
5-10 well geared and coordinated people can carry 20-30 noobs and slackers through entire mc, this is not the case in bwl anymore, and by slackers i dont mean people with low dps.
---
Is Rogue pickpocketing BRD still the best/easiest way to gold farm at 60? I heard it got nerfed and that mobs will resist pickpockets a lot more now, but I'm not sure.
---
its alright. just remember those average players are going to spend hours upon hours in BWL and still take 2+ to clear MC while anyone putting in even the slightjest bit of effort to get prebis/bis/using consumes/getting wbuffs is gonna clear both more than twice as fast.
---
Nat has it all figured out
---
ECS doesn't seem to account for talents and racials - for an Orc Warrior using Axes / Troll Hunter using bows you'll want to keep this in mind :)
---
Other then that I really like the addon.
---
Extra swing all the way. Vanq sword+sword from uld (super easy to farm) is better than what the op has. Idk what other mace youd go for either but getting those 2 swords im talking about is easy and cheaper.
---
Yes, I think its slightly off, for instance I think all warlock curses are high tier, while that list has agony and doom on low tier.
---
But it was the first list I found, and should  give some idea of the debuff tier system.
---
You are posting this because you know those realms will die first. Soon tm
---
That is a thing everyone could've known months before classic even came out
---
Not really, its pretty chill and fun
---
So there's a bit of a misconception here. You're right that health doesn't regen through spirit in combat, it does not have a 5 sec rule for spirit regen in combat. However, neither MP5 (mana per five seconds) or HP5 (health per five seconds) use the 5 second rule timer, you get them regardless. This works as HP5, not as a spirit regen.
---
Sounds like you went on quite the quest there, friend.
---
Yeah man, trying to solo farm honor as horde lock is terrible. I either go 2hrs not seeing any alliance, or a 5-10man group runs me over.
---
So jelly of ally rogues, so many horde just wondering around solo, all I see is free kills.
---
Because there are like 6 patches with 50%(???) droprate and long-ish respawn time? And demand for Water is huge.
---
It's over everything. The transmute of Arcanite is 10g, and the rest comes from a very small number of potions that turn a profit (mongoose, shadow power, mighty rage).
---
This explains why we're constantly locking ourselves out of Jed runs. Thanks a ton, OP.
---
Roll pve
---
Pathetic video. Op
---
I’m incredibly happy with my guild, was a relatively new member to the guild (only ran MC 2 times before). I had no real connections yet, but was showing an interest in being a tank for our guilds second group. This all was a huge learning period for me as well as I haven’t played wow before this. Needless to say, binding drops in my third week and I made enough of an impression that they passed the left binding to me as I’m not working towards operating as the MT. Was ecstatic to receive a drop like that given the context, really makes me have complete trust in the fairness of our loot council. Great leadership all around.
---
i'd be scared of burn out if your group has a must flask mentality for mc
---
Was pretty awesome seeing a lot of alliance guilds working together.  We had over 60 alliance just trying to keep the horde held back in the swamp.  Everyone from Premo, send it , not like this, riot and more all played a part.  GG boys.
---
&gt; Another pro of having a diverse line-up is that it greatly helps loot distribution. 
---
How does this help loot distribution, these classes will still want all the same premier pieces that the traditional damage dealing classes will want yet they are in essence going to waste by giving them to a suboptimal spec. I understand the argument for bringing and extra rogue or hunter for instance so that their tier gear doesn't rot however if that's what you're trying to say. 
---
&gt;Finally, if enhance or boomkin are SO underpower that they are not worth bringing in raids, perhaps we should ask for some class rebalance instead of blaming player who are trying to play a build that is supposed to be played.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting that these specs are supposed to be played from. I'd offer two counter arguments, the first is that assuming you mean they're supposed to be played because blizzard put them in the game, I think that's faulty logic, blizzard put three talent trees with a multitude of options and possible combinations in the game. Blizzard doesn't lay out a limited number of specific specs with no variability and force you to choose from them. These specs are merely a result of the community and the meta coming to an agreement of balance between optimal and viability, similar to net decking in hearthstone. The second is that PvE is only one facet of the game and while certain specs such as ele shaman may be lacking in PvE, they excel in PvP. We're not trying to recreate the same mistakes retail WoW made with making every class able to fill every role in every situation.
---
3-piece set bonus is what makes them worthwile.
---
I play alliance lock, what do you expect.
---
I can't fear Undeads or charm them, and orcs have a high 25% chance to ressist my CC.
---
OFcourse I have to stab them in the back, and if they are innocent when I kill them, well they will have deserved it later.
---
I'm on a fairly even server, I got ganked 11 times in an hour, so I joined a raid group and hunted down anything that was red for the rest of the night.
---
Violence is a cycle.
---
&gt;  it happens pretty much everywhere on every server
---
I don't mean like a specific time in EPL when alliance takes over LHC. I'm asking which pvp server as a whole has more alliance than horde.
---
Private server pugs don't have higher quality players.   It's just the same people doing the same content  over...and over... and over...
---
It's like how playing dark souls the 2nd go around on new game plus is actually a lot easier.
---
True.
---
Everyone gets there excitement from different things.
---
Some People from challenging themselfs and other People from spending time with there m8s just smashing some Level 57 scrubs face :P
---
Nature protection potions help
---
This was great
---
Smh.
---
Warrior is my unironic least favorite class to fight for this reason. Sure the match up isn't hard but it has the biggest variance in RNG and can lead to some annoying losses that you feel like you should of won.
---
You said you rerolled off of Herod. Now you play on Herod? Also are you playing during prime time and trying to raid/dungeon grind? Reading through other peoples comments people are specifically leaving Herod because of how unfun it is for Alliance. 
---
Regardless, you are the one outlier that enjoys the game right now on Alliance. Good for you. I quit and am not coming back until at least BWL.
---
Blitzkrieg member here. Please keep playing so we at least have someone to kill. We hate running around for 30mins to find like 5 alliance lol. 
---
And I swear all alliance we ever see are organized groups (not complaining about the good fights u guys put up, it's a lot of fun when someone fights back). But still you guys have so many carefree solo hordies running around just asking to die :D
---
There it is.
---
Ask Assmonbald how he got hit with a name change and if there was any streamer favouritism.
---
A drop might be different than a dusty tome loot. A drop will make a roll dice situation while the dusty tome is simply looted without a roll.
---
When a tome drops you simply cannot roll because of unique tomes but you can see it inside the corpse because people are still rolling for it, but when its in a dusty tome the game hides it from the loot window and despawns the "empty" tome after looting because no one is rolling for it.
---
yes I did. You didnt, atleast not correctly.
---
Weak auras is a hugely customisable add-on that can allow players to do any number of  things from as simple as giving alerts when your battle shout falls off to as complex as showing you countdown timers over nameplates that indicate how long you have before your overpower window ends.
---
I've gotten 2 arcane crystals from 1 RTV.... i wish i could have seen the look on my face :-)
---
Save ironfoe. Use it with flurry axe and just go fury. Get hand of justice.
---
They were gonna do that anyways. Blessing of Freedom effect.
---
You have absolutely no chance to compensate with skill in "pre raid bis" against someone with raid gear. Most of the gear pre bis has 0 or very low stamina and raid gear has a shitload of stamina. Same for caster gear with int and melee with weapon damage. At this point it's not about you being good but your opponent being terrible

---
If it's all old knowledge, maybe you can answer his question?
---
I actually had that happen to me. Ally warrior charged my mob and finished it off and proceeded to beat me to a pulp. I tried to regain my pride by ressing, bandaging and engaging him while he was fighting a croc.
---
On a side note maybe I lost because he had 6 levels on me.
---
Leveling alt past 48 is fun :D I should make NE for faster corpse run damn.
---
This is like people insisting EQ1 raids were hard.
---
Also, because you're using Edgemaster's, your hit cap is 6%.
---
Got any DF belts bro?
---
Bro it should be fine. The amount of people who are going to be doing bgs will be massive, so im not saying you wont ever see a premade, but the chances of consistently running into one will be low, just due to how many people are playing.  
---
  
---
Can be wrong though, but just seems unlikely.
---
You could tell them either you Nightfall or you don't raid.
---
I presumed he had already looked it up since he gave an example. So I had no reason to believe he is not capable of looking at the listing from the same source.
---
I play Horde on a Horde dominated server but I wouldn’t know we had more numbers if I didn’t read about it here. World PvE is impossible. I can’t go anywhere without getting ganked by roaming alliance death squads. Although I always played vanilla and retail on PvP servers, I really regret not rolling PvE for classic.
---
4 characters \* 8 days \* 24 hours / 98 days = 8 hours a day
---
Or basically a full time job.
---
It must be a nice novelty for you
---
He got his warlock's name forcefully changed for violating naming conventions even if his retail character still has that name, and gm's replied to him in tickets that they can't help him and the ruling was correct.  
---
Clearly streamer favoritism.
---
Ah, I see, you just skimmed and made an assumption. That happens.
---
Still, care to share your pserver knowledge? I'm a bit rusty on this topic too, so enlighten us!
---
Obvious bait is obvious
---
But if you are Rank 6 this week that means you did most of your pvp in groups smaller then 5 or even solo
---
&gt; Or the pocket lock summons them immediately.
---
Since when Alliance control entrance to BRD/UBRS/DM/Strat to summon something? :)
---
You'd die instantly to a couple of crushing blows from most raid bosses without shield block and the added armor.
---
1) Some would kill you despite honorless buff (I make sure to drop 0 honor)
---
2) Others will know that you have it and will CC you until you lose it.
---
Just pick the black lotus in AV.
---
easy.
---
I've seen this work on characters that are lvl 30+
---
Whats the point having awzm gear when there is no one to see it? :D
---
What's wrong with you? Why do you assume that about an undead player? Do you also assume that every female human player is slim with fairly big tits?
---
Maintank, or offtanks for that matter should never be using GFPP, its a complete and utter waste of a potion cooldown and gold.
---
oh yeah i forgot about DM Tribute summoning group.  I only based that comment because I specifically remember that I cant summon someone in DMW when we wiped doing warlock quest.  Maybe DM tribute is different after you kill the king?
---
(gonna test it again when I get a chance, maybe they changed something)
---
To add to this, vanilla server capacity was much smaller than classic, so there were just generally fewer people to run into.
---
The reward is killing stuff faster and topping metuhrz.
---
I don't get how the black lotus can already be so expensive, considering you literally don't need flasks to clear all the current content.
---
I still disagree, I've done both and think mage beats hunter to 5 specifically, but if you find some kind of experimental video and want to put it up on your law blog that'd be swell.
---
Most people who are seriously aiming for r12, 13 and 14 are not raiding ubrs. They are forming 3-5 man death squads roaming the world.
---
Wpl -&gt; Epl -&gt; Wpl -&gt; portal Darna -&gt; Felwood -&gt; Winterspring -&gt; Felwood -&gt; portal IF -&gt; Wpl and repeat the previous steps.
---
Not going to be there in 1.12
---
Hunter/Druid main and constantly stoned. Can confirm.
---
Thanks
---
Like others said just grab it after reset, ezpz. I got BT just by having my alt hunter sit there during prime time, really lucky I was able to get it. BT is super fucking sweet too like, unreal attack speed, you arent even ready for it until you see it.
---
Unyielding mace is almost just as good atm, so if you can sell wardenstaff for more its prob worth selling
---
And there are also people who try to get HKs and feel disappointed when the target ended up being 0 honor due to a buff they cant see.
---
It will, 100%. There'll still be the occasional loser who just wants to kill players who don't have the ability to fight back, but right now you're just bring caught up in the storm of honor farming.
---
Once BGs drop, those players will move in there, and whilst Horde will try to add some extra HKs to their grind whilst in the queue crosserver-BG means those queues will sub 5 minutes, so only regions close to their capitals are on any real danger.
---
Also, 1.12 talent trees are much more streamlined than previous talent trees. Most classes are 10\~20% stronger simply because of the talents.
---
Well I got 150 views since posting this and I got about 25 Twitch followers during the 40 minute stream, so I'm happy with the results and like I mentioned, I genuinely had fun doing it as did everyone who took part, both of which are apparent if you watch the video. 
---
If you don't like the content then why comment on it? Go watch Fortnite or whatever it is that doesn't make you sad and angry :)
---
youre a mistake
---
Doing nothing but 10v1 ganking is about the most carebear thing anybody can do.
---
doesn't work for classic
---
10/10 writing will read about other shitty quests you experience
---
The game is fun. You just dont enjoy the same thing as most ppl on pvp servers I'd suggest trying pve servers.
---
This sub is a toxic cesspool of utter fuckwads tbh.
---
Lol on my server the alliance work with the horde to get honor.....
---
Honestly it should. Level 1-20 in vanilla is pure gold.
---
Honestly?  I've levelled two warriors -one in classic and one in TBC.    
---
   
---
Fury is the way to go!  Some people like to respec Arms at around level 40, but if you find two good weapons, you will be fine dual wielding (which is what I much prefer).  
---
I'm 60 and have tanked all of BRD and LBRS (and just about everything before that too) without issue.
---
I can give my spots away, the nagas on the shoreline in Azshara are prime af. Theyre very easy to kill, very spread out too and are used for 1 quest that most dont do. They have a chance of dropping a golden pearl from the clams, so your gph depends entirely on how much you can sell that for and how quick you can kill. They stop being xph efficient at 56, thats when you move to deadwind pass. Should be quite dead by now hopefully but the area *can* sustain 2 people. 3 people has you fighting over mobs and if theres any more that that (total, so including you) just get out. Anyway youll be grinding the ogres, they drop massive amounts of runecloth, die as easy as the nagas, arent used for a single quest *and* drop a very decent amount of silver. Its like 5-7s per kill, also drop a good wrist or hand enchant, might still be worth money. You can grind these bad boys from 55 on, idk a more xp/gph efficient mob especially if you have the area to yourself, which you should. Expect to go to stonard or whichever alli town is closest quite often to mail your runecloth to a bankalt and sell trash, so set your hearth there. I honestly love this spot.
---
&gt;You said you rerolled off of Herod. Now you play on Herod?
---
Yes the queues were annoying but I mostly rerolled horde to play with a friend. Having said that I still play there since I can't play horde and alliance on the same server. I like to paladin and might as well do it where I have resources. Anyway I can't speak for other alliance but when I play in the higher level zones I make friends with the people there so we can help each other. The stories I see people post is just them being solo camped and not making friends to help them.
---
Lol epic
---
Warlock
---
Level as Fury/Arms and put on a shield for tanking dungeons. As long as you're careful with pulling that's honestly all you need.
---
Warrior DPS will feel slow and clunky until you get Whirlwind at 36, which is your first "extra" attack other than Overpower. Once you get that you can respec into Arms for Sweeping Strikes, which means Whirlwind will hit two enemies for double damage giving you some nice cleave potential.
---
Free Auction Potion and charge !  
---
Try to CC me, while i MS you ass !
---
Herod definitely isn't even.  I don't think it ever was.
---
Nope. Even with shadowweaving if your locks are consistently outdpsing your mages your mages are shit.
---
Layering affects only open world grind (which is optimal only for a mage) and open world questing (which is hardly optimal for anyone). The best and fastest way to level your character was dungeon grind and layering doesn't affect it.
---
To check if BL will be a problem:
---
- Check the logs from your server and...
---
...if people are using BL now, you have a problem
---
...if people aren’t using BL now, there will be plenty of supply
---
Supply and demand rule these markets. 
---
Whilst I believe there are BL mafias out there camping and timing spawns in a more sophisticated version of the devilsaur mafias, I also believe we are collectively gathering 90% of the ~670 BLs that spawn every week on each server, way more than was ever gathered in vanilla.  
---
Supply is pretty high as long as demand doesn’t use it all up ahead of when it’s ACTUALLY needed
---
How long did it take to get medicine pouch? I’m guessing you let your party kill the mobs while you were dead then Rez to loot?
---
I don't have a huge amount of time to play so I'm still chugging away in the 20s which I guess means I haven't hit any of the hotspots yet as an Alliance lad. When I do see high level Horde I give them a wave and they usually wave back. War is hell.
---
You're probably right, though I will mention that OP is a paladin not a warrior (though I recognize that a similar point still applies with Holy Shield and blessing of sanctuary).
---
Making the game less fun, more of a chore and constantly doing shit you don't want is not the answer and just because you don't want to do that does not make you "the weeping masses".
---
Why can you people not just accept that Blizzard fucked up and made this game incredibly unfun for lots of people due to poor decision making on their part, rather than responding with the tired, predictable and constant comebacks that they are "weeping masses", "carebears" or whatever other banal derogatory you want to come out with the second anyone voices their displeasure that the game has been mishandled so badly that a large chunk of its playerbase does not find it remotely enjoyable any more and with very good reason? 
---
You lot are like a stuck record.
---
Which is why Blizzard should do something to fix their game
---
Damn this gave me the chills
---
I pvped when I levelled. But now I'm 60, with my robe of the void and stuck on the crafting mats mount quests... cannot be bothered leaving the cities.
---
Do I play solo and get crushed by roaming revenge alliance or join a hunting raid? I'd rather wait for my turn in Total War Warhammer.
---
Not in the least friend. It's my own fault though. I am sort of like King Midas' doppelganger. Everything I touch turns to shit.
---
55-45 server, stop making shit up
---
Here's what I did: level as arms until 40, swap to fury and dual wield tank everything to level 60. Worked out pretty well for me, went fury until I completed it then the rest went into prot.
---
"For one, I have never initiated an attack on any horde as an alliance member, especially if they are just questing or farming. I would simply find another spot. I find it strange how the game focuses on encouraging mob mentality of killing any "opposing faction" you see instead of being a positive influence to the guild and community"
---
please reroll on a pve server, carebear, we don't need the likes of you on the alliance side.
---
Undeath to water was 1200-1300g on my server..
---
I only bought life to earth for easy 3-8g a day (yes, essence of earth prices vary wildly from 5 to 10 gold).
---
I'm undead because orc warlocks lorely are weird and metal casting hands.
---
Legend?
---
Mirin large vape liquid tanks. I'm not sure what surprises me more: that i'm playing wow classic 15 years later or that i sit smoking a vape while i play it.
---
Blastershot launcher is because of that a pvp ranged weapon until you get the cape from Azuregos.

---
Give me your innervate! I pay 1g.
---
Ice armor keybound to 1 really makes my head scratch...
---
And it’s nice to know that The Horde players are still stroking their egos with how cool they are because they play the uglier character models. It must really help with the immersion when your character looks like you do
---
But this is cutting edge progression! Classic is -soooooooo- hard, never gonna cut it with "meme" specs!
---
First, have all your warriors be ready to throw on shields and tank her.  She’s very tankable in DPS gear and fury spec. 
---
Second, casters should be ready at the phase 3 transition. If they get aggro, move to the tanking position so the raid doesn’t get cleave/tail swipe/breath. Casters can also pop limited invulnerability potions to get an extra few seconds. 
---
Third, after the MT gets fireballed, have him build rage on whelps, then run over to Ony during phase 2 and dump it, rinse and repeat. You can’t melee her but you can use specials like Shield Slam or Sunder Armor.  When she’s about to land, pop Recklessness, switch back to Defensive Stance, and pop a rage potion.  If you’re lucky you’ll get her back.
---
If you are new to Wow, ill advise you to go Arms.  
---
You are perfectly able to Tank any dungeon with an Arms, spec.  
---
Read yourself into:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-arms-warrior-leveling-talent-build-1-60](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-arms-warrior-leveling-talent-build-1-60)  \- Actually a decent guide !  
---
The reason for Going Arms is the Anger Management Talent, which will save your rage when stance dancing, and is a very good talent for a new Warrior and get the hang of things.  
---
I've used it, and i loved it !  
---
Fury is decent to, but i suggest you swap to that around lvl 55(ish) if you got some nice dual wield weapons and maybe some hit gear.
---
I do play on a PvE server, so swing and a miss. 
---
From an outsider its blatantly obvious watching people get corpse camped from Thorium point all the way to Blackrock that this is just a completely unfun, unengaging and not remotely compelling gameplay experience though and anyone with half a brain can see that.
---
Years of learning these moves in UBRS - so skilled that IT actually pretends to be feared - pets getting smarter
---
Ready to tank in leathbr gear lol
---
Stop being so vindictive towards every post. Happens so often I come across something cool, want to comment - but no, locked down! You are not being very objective.
---
"I've suffered so now they have to!" 
---
OP sounds like he's 12.
---
Server based battlegrounds would make things worse for everyone too. He doesn't care as long as its worse for them than it is for him.
---
Menethil docks have yielded some to me
---
I hear you brother...
---
You definitely don't want to spread your talent points all over places, it might sound lame but the most efficient and easiest way to finding your talents is checking it out from [wowhead.com](https://wowhead.com) or [icy-veins.com](https://icy-veins.com) before you spend them, basically when it comes to warrior and leveling, reaching level 30 is big for warrior since at that level you will reach to sweeping strikes, arms tree 30th point. This also fits with the fact that after you reach level 30, you will want to ask for help to get whirlwind axe and you are set for questing for the next 15 levels with that weapon, it's so good. When it comes down to protection tree, it's a lack cluster for leveling, you won't get any significant improvements for tanking, at end game, players who tank in raids tend to swap for protection tree since that's the time you will actually need every single defensive improvement. 
---
Tanking is really not that hard and don't let people in hurry dictate your tempo. Get used to it, when you know your abilities and have better gear from dungeons you will gain speed to clearing over time. AND PRO TIP, you might not have heard about this thing called "mana" it's a thing your healer and caster dps need to use their most powerful abilities to keep the run clean and smooth. As master race, warriors don't need mana, but more importantly let the "incompetent" classes drink their mana back, they don't like it if you don't wait them (trust me i know:) ).
---
ITT: People who think - any - warrior or hunter will willing sit there and spam wing clip/hamstring and hold 1 weapon for the rest of the game. The kinds of people who seek to bring this kind of raid utility aren't playing those classes...
---
Haha they were 4 of the same guild, I'm thankfully in a different one!
---
You know that layers are gone right?
---
This isnt Starta mate, 300 alliance are not going to bring the fight to 3000-4000 horde players on an imbalance server! 
---
Layering was required to prevent folk queing at spawn points to complete quests. The only way to have prevented layering was to have x10 of the number of servers there currently is. Thats something Blizz decided they didnt want.
---
What are you talking about
---
I don't understand. What is the point?
---
Im on Bigglesworth and Alliance. It's ok but our numbers are definitely dwindling. Could've just been the recent holiday but I can think of one or two larger guilds that's transferred entirely.
---
Sure, level 54 and I did a level 60 priest. It is nice when it's possible or when I am in a grp and lvl 60 enemies jump in like they could kill us easily and we kill him. So satisfying. But getting killed... So.. Often.. And not being able to do anything against it..mmh. Too often I know exactly I can't do anything.
---
I think the point is most guild/raid leaders would prefer that enhance to just spec resto instead.  If you end up with 8 resto shamans that is a problem a raid leader would be happy to deal with.
---
Same experience, I switched to first 3 bosses with herbalism.
---
hahahaha brilliant! That pally would have been salty!!! :D
---
I can only speak from my experience while lvling during release, and I saw way more "layer pls" in all global/general/guild chat all the time compared to "LFM spellcleave", so I would say layering was a bigger problem.
---
And when people were switching layers, it just made it worse for people left behind (like me, because I like wpvp) where you just eventually got on horde/alliance dominated layers.
---
Also you couldn't join death squads that were advertised in general,  because guess what. That would make you change layers. I formed a lot of death squads myself, but people were more interested in playing in their little safespace layer bubbles than actually contesting anything.
---
Obviously not everyone, but I am asbolutely confident that there was a signifcantly portion of people lvling by abusing layers over people sitting in dungeons from like lvl 15 to 60.
---
It's pve lmao
---
You know you are aren't playing real classic right? Go play 1.01 or 1.02 and try mc or onyxia. Your gonna have a bad time. 1.12 is easier with all the updated spells and gear. Not to mention the raid needs.
---
Here is the weird thing..... as a horde currently in my mid 30's I get wrecked and camped by raid geared 60's at least once an hour on my FULL server.  But I don't whine and cry about the alliance raid geared 60s ganking me because im an adult.
---
That is the difference between the two factions.
---
So you're talking about something you have first hand experience with smart.
---
Yep, and people weren't ready for phase 2, because they didn't get bathed in blood while lvling, which they would have been if there were no layers on release.
---
I've yet to see a warlock reach the top 5 overall dps
---
nice one
---
That might happen. But that's not really gonna matter bcus by then he should have way better rings
---
Then it's a good thing the developers used a word like warcraft, which refers to the practice of war rather than to a specific war. Because that way my point is correct and you're wrong.
---
This is probably correct.
---
Please put an according flair before bot auto-removes your post :(
---
Ony doesn't do much tank dmg, even wls can tank her
---
What nonsense.
---
Lets just reduce the 3% chance to get an item to 1.5% for no reason. Why? BeCaUsE iT WaS lIKe ThAt in vAniLLa.
---
Nope. Not the way the good guilds do it. Every melee goes in and nuke the boss within 30 sec while getting spam healed. Our melee top the dps with around 900-1000 dps. So yeah
---
That was certainly the highlight of my morning, thanks OP
---
More realistic than Talisman: Hakkar Head, Spellpower Trinket. :)
---
I didn't ask who gave the order...!
---
Because this is the business we've chosen!
---
Wait why would you give that to a hunter? Surely that item only procs on melee attack?
---
Uh yeah it's not just horde, I see alliance member forming groups to go farm other players, I was just gathering herbs the other day and got a random raid invite, when I lined they told me to head to the cost cuz they were killing horde, When I got there I see 8 alliance played and 3-4 horde. Soon as I realized it was just a ganking group I bailed, went back to the herbs. And soon as I got done innocently picking a flower an undead Rogue level 60 killed me..... the whole thing is really annoying
---
Aw are you crying now?
---
&gt; potentially unfriendly outside area 
---
I see you play horde, for alliance it's definitely unfriendly outside area.
---
Well I am on a fairly balanced server playing a Horde warrior. I am also getting slaughtered by alliance. #HordesLiveMatter
---
Take it slow. Don’t do “xp runs”, use your time to get pre bis. It’s kinda sad the amount of 60 mages/locks walk around in greens and think “oh shit, now I have to do proper runs to farm gear instead of rushing to 60 and end up having to do it all again”.
---
&gt;This isnt Starta mate, 300 alliance are not going to bring the fight to 3000-4000 horde players on an imbalance server!
---
Thats only a few servers, most servers aren't that bad in terms of the server ratio. People just don't want to fight, while horde does, and thus alliance just becomes prey instead of predators.
---
&gt;Layering was required to prevent folk queing at spawn points to complete quests. The only way to have prevented layering was to have x10 of the number of servers there currently is. Thats something Blizz decided they didnt want.
---
Nah, private servers had up to 3x the concurrent cap of classic servers, and they worked fine, the 2 first weeks were always a shitshow but after that dynamic respawning (which is also in place on classic servers) fixed the rest of the issues.
---
If we didn't have layering, you lot would be moaning that your servers were totally dead and begging for merges.
---
winter squid. Fish it fish if fish it.....and after March, DPS will need it and pay a lot for it!
---
&gt; And I fucking told you that this wont work lol.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I know my class and I know the gear that exists. You expect shamans to tank in cloth or what?
---
The mountain of [evidence](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1150), the plethora of shaman raid tanks on my server and my own experience says otherwise. Clearly, you missed a whole entire spec for shamans, most likely because some uninformed kid told you it's not possible by simply looking at gear.
---
I have wow installed on a m2 ssd and i get way faster loading screens after i delete the cache.
---
Won’t they still come at the raid?
---
That’s going to be one dead wolf pancake
---
What belt are you using in the above setup? You'd use brigam girdle or onslaught belt, no use for the blackstone ring
---
The pirate realms were 99% toxic assholes that ran off anyone that wasn't also toxic.  Then it devolved and got even worse.  They were a small step up from 4chan by the time that classic came around.
---
people roam around for pvping, they pick up herbs while roaming about 
---
the pvers aren't even playing and only need a few consumes every raid night
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
its just a visual change though
---
**&lt;Goon Squad&gt; | PvE | Mograine - EU | Semi-Casual**
---
We're a group of individuals who were somewhat frustrated with the usual dynamics of raiding guilds, from the unfair and preferential treatment that certain members would get, to the mandatory serious attitude that chafes those of us who merely want to have fun in a video game and have other commitments, be it to other friends, significant others or even to other interests.
---
**Enviroment**
---
This is number one when it comes to a smooth clear. We're a semi-casual guild looking for all types of people from socials to pvpers and raiders. We're looking for people who are patient, don't mind having a laugh and understand that mistakes do happen, As long as you're able to listen when required and can handle a bit of not-so-serious banter, you'll fit right in.
---
**Leadership**
---
The Guild has no real defined leader as it is run by a council. While there's never a perfect system we hope that by running the guild via a council we'll be able to limit any sort of nepotism and/or major douchebaggery.
---
**Future**
---
Ideally we'd like to have enough members so we can easily form groups when needed.
---
We're currently looking for Healers and DPS when it comes to raiding, but if you are interested in joining us we will look at your application even if you do not fill these criteria as we don't believe in rejecting someone for playing a non-meta spec.
---
**Raiding**
---
Raidtimes are Wednesday &amp; Sunday 20:00-23:00 Server Time
---
We are currently using MS&gt;OS for our pug runs, however in the future when we can consistantly field only Guild members to Raids, we will utilize the EPGP system.
---
Having discussed all loot rules currently available we feel that a simple version of EPGP fits best with our semi-casual motif.
---
Current Raid Progress: Molten Core - 9/10 | Onyxia's Lair - 1/1
---
Being a semi-casual guild and with our core values in mind, we don't expect you to turn up to every single raid. We have a system in place for you to just sign up for the raid(s) you want to come to.
---
**Expectations**
---
This is what you can expect from us. - A guild with sociable players, with a wide range of experience and knowledge
---
This is what we expect from you: - Fluent, or at least understandable, verbal and written English - Thick skin
---
**Contacts**
---
Contact us via Discord at Suno#3987 or Lackluster in-game if you're interested.
---
I still have a stack of those week of free game play things that they had at stores. I would buy some stuff, disguise the papers then walk out of the store with them to use - they were free but the store always wanted to get on my case about shit like that. I ended up taking, I think about 10+ of them in one go once? After moving to the new house, I noticed them in my old room as I was cleaning up, I still had them after all these years. I started in TBC and I had taken them before WotLK dropped. I was like 17 at the time I think.
---
Watched some of your video. I tank at 60 and I keybinding all markers to my F1-F8 keys, makes for easy marking. And you're low lvl, so I would personally recommend going arms and just tanking with a 2Hander (unless you really like shield ofcause), and only switching to a shield if you're getting hammered by maybe 5 mobs.
---
I love it too. Horde are not stupidly aggresive.
---
The pirate realms were 99% toxic assholes that ran off anyone that wasn't also toxic.  Then they perpetually devolved and got worse and worse.  They were a small step up from 4chan by the time that classic came around.
---
Take this shit post as a prime example.  He isn't complaining because the game is literally unplayable for one faction.  He's complaining, because the other people are legitimately upset about it.
---
Turn your sound on. 
---
You can also hear enemy warlocks proccs.
---
I get to do something I like *and* die sooner? Nice.
---
Let's be honest. The people who like LC the most are usually on the council. It's a good concept but I think it's hard to execute fairly, and can easily cause drama. More drama than DKP imo.
---
108 movement speed, that's actually scary
---
Is it any of the top guilds that left?
---
It literally takes 20-40 min to get inside blackrock mountain from thorium point on some servers, you guys can wait for bg queues to pop
---
Hey i never exercise and my diet is made of twix and cereals + wow 12h a day :D
---
Once you go Troll, you never reroll
---
If BWL was to come out right now, things would b even more fucked up at BRM.
---
Let pvpers get the bgs to get ppl off BRM (atleast most of them), so ppl dont have to cringe to get the letter.
---
Druids and rogues all with rank 14 and the occasional banned mage who likes rooftops to much.
---
I have a feeling there will be a lot of turtleling from alliance mainly. For nostalgia but also some kind of revenge for being a minority outside BG's.
---
Also the faster people get exalted, the longer games it will be so, 20min games will probably be now at start.
---
Yoo! 
---
I'm a paladin lvl 60 who always has been a healer. I have played WoW Since 2005 and Now I am back into classic. I know alot of stuf from ingame, what is worth money etc. But I really want a way to make some gold. I am tailoring/enchanting because I like those professions. Back in the old game I could earn some money with it, because I was a big ''twink enchanter'' on my server. Now every1 has everything , daily /2 spams with enchanters looking for work. I try to get every pattern to be''special'' doing some rep things atm to be ready for phase 3 ( Thorium point, Furbolg shit) But it doesn't make me any gold right now. Doing 1 mooncloth every 4 days gives me 11-13g . My server Skullflame EU as Alliance has a 30% population against 70% horde, Going out to farm stuff is a no-go at the moment.
---
 Any1 has some tips? beside the dungeon farms, weird jumpruns, or lasher runs?
---
I am not going to respec everytime I want to earn some money. because it basicly cost me money.
---
I currently have 500g and still need a few extra  to buy 6 arcanite bars and deliver 350g to quest for my Epic Mount quest. 
---
I basicly earned my current gold by just spamming dungeons and hoping to win stuff ( Strat living for orbs, or patterns) but it takes alot of time to just hopefully earn some).
---
TLDR: Holy paladin looking for a new good way to earn some money (no mining/herbalism)
---
I don't need to. I have eyes and half a brain. 
---
Also, take your own advice then and stop telling people to "reroll on a PvE server" and other banal shit like that because you aren't experiencing the same issues they are, because "you don't have first hand experience of it".
---
Thanks dude!
---
I was saving for an epic mount then realised the hours I put into farming gold would be better spent doing something fun since I didn't actually care too much about an epic mount as I won't really be PvPing. 
---
I figured since I can only play for an hour or two per day now (new job), it would be more valuable building my stream a bit and doing something creative. It's a shame some people have reacted like this tbh, I thought the Classic community would appreciate it and support one another...
---
Everyone who took part had a great time and I honestly had the most fun I've had on WoW in weeks... Everyone said I should do a weekly gameshow etc, so I will def be doing more regardless of what Reddit says lol
---
I'm probably gonna do these weekly if I can farm enough gold :)
---
I am sure "death squads" were incredibly rare during p1 for the obvious reason. I have met ton of opposing faction while leveling but any pvp aside from obvious gank attempts from people several levels above were very very very rare which is obvious as well, most people preferred to invest their time in leveling then in pointless gank which doesn't give you honor.
---
If anything, layering catered to the casual crowd and helped them, I will give a brief classification of levelers back them:
---
1. Hardcore levelers (mage): huge boost by layering to a very low percent of population.
---
2. Hardcore levelers (other classes): dungeon leveling unaffected by layering.
---
3. Casual levelers: open world questing boosted by layering if they used it.
---
Layering absence would just result in a delay for leveling to the category 3 (and 1 but they would move to category 2 then). Do you see all these people crying about "I am below 60 and I cannot level at all"? Imagine layering non-existent then multiply the crying by 2-3-4 whatever since more people would be sitting below 60 by now even. Something no one wants to happen.
---
It's through GoA and other buffs usually
---
 Plus you can fish for spell crit with rank 1 shock to get elemental devastation which applies 9% crit for x seconds. It can stack kinda whack
---
?
---
You mean the easy way?
---
I've just elaborated it's not just visual:
---
&gt;While the true level of the creature remains the same, it appears lowered to the character who is drunk. The apparent level of a mob goes down by up to 5 levels while "completely smashed", and slowly returns to its actual level while slowly sobering up. The player still receives the same XP for killing mobs as they would while sober. 
---
[source](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Drunk)
---
So for example if I'm lvl51 and I pull a lvl54 mob, I would miss and the mob would dodge a lot. I drink something strong (1 item) it would go down 1-2 levels so my hit chance and everything is normalised to my level.
---
Pretty much the only relevant ability from debuff prios is deep wounds not knocking anything off, enabling people to actually go impale.  In any half serious raiding guild you already have 12-13 set debuffs and fill with corruptions, which are the highest priority dot (no secondary effect other than the dot).  Spell scaling is based off of cast time so shadowburn scales in dps the exact same as shadowbolt does, but does less damage and eats up imp shadowbolt stacks while also being insanely mana inefficient.  You still never really use it except for after your final shadowbolt is traveling to the target, or for movement.
---
Probably the best way to put our server is we have a guild named Czech Division that is now European Division, accurately sums up how many people left
---
Yep, what he said.
---
Ironically I often find older games less stressful to play for this exact reason. For instance in the old shooters like Quake or Unreal Tournamend (1999) it's very easy to parse what is part of the scenery versus what are game objects that you can interact with (pickups, projectiles, etc.). Some newer games by contrast are much overloaded visually and visual processing becomes taxing to me.
---
What even is english
---
Yes. But 3x as many will come if you walk over eggs to get back
---
Comes out of the gbank. Those flasks you have prepped for bwl all gone
---
WOW.
---
This is how I tank Ony in a 20 split:
---
P1: As you would do in a 40-man
---
P2: I mark up a whelp that I bring with me as long as possible during P2, it makes me procc Revenge which I use everytime it's up on Onyxia.
---
Casters focus on bringing Onyxia down, but stop dpsing around 41-42%. Then we wait for Onyxia to target the first healer with her fireball and then we bring her down fully.
---
P3 transition: berserker stance, berserker rage (or recklessness) as she lands, pop a mighty rage potion (if rage starved) and start dumping rage to get an early lead. At this point she's either on me straight away, or I get the threat back before she kills anyone and sticks to me.
---
P3: As you would do in a 40-man
---
Presto!
---
Yeah, like others have said, doesn't sound like you have the group for a Rag kill. Probably have to decide between shopping for a better group or gutting part of yours for better/more willing players.
---
You can set posts to be autoremoved if they don't have a flair, with automod messaging people after they submit to flair it to avoid removal.
---
So is it Venture and Big dig mining co that left?
---
I’m getting some serious Leroy vibes from this vid, the parallels are there
---
The point is make queues longer for horde so they stay in the open world ganking instead of doing bgs.
---
The autoshot timer counts during aimed shot cast, so you usually get another autoshot after the aimed shot is loose.
---
This is one of the reasons you want a slow weapon, so aimed shot does not clip too much of your next next autoshot.
---
Imo, carapace spine corssbow and soon bloodseeker are the best.
---
&gt; And the most critical damage the system caused, was that it made alliance too soft in terms of PvP. Don't want to get used to fighting? Just switch layer as soon as you see a horde. Get ganked once? New layer.
---
do ppl believe the stupid shit they say?
---
I noticed the mobs on the northwest side of WC (so left when you get to the main area, towards lord Cobrahn) reset when you jump down there. Though a handy trick I found is you can just tag one mob early on and he'll help you aggro the rest in that area. Though the annoying thing about WC is the mobs who run away in fear often run away forever and it can be really tedious to track them down.
---
TL;DR - reroll pve
---
Crusader for pvp
---
wow, long reply
---
You have a good point about battlegroups basically punishing horde on balanced servers.  They will have to bear some of the queue burden without the compensation of dominating the open world.
---
Battlegroups essentially force certain people who are already at a disadvantage to supplement the queue times of other people who are already better off.  
---
I do want battlegroups so we get more variety in the teams and people we fight against.  But like I originally said, not adding them would make the dominant faction take a hard look at what what that means for their enjoyment of the game.  Then just give them an out (transfers), and the servers will start to even up.
---
Funny, but could have been worded better.
---
Farming in silithus and lots of rend runs + trash farming in mc before raidday.
---
Is the on equip effect a warcraft 3 reference? In Wc3 Death Knights had Unholy Aura which boosted movement speed and hitpoints regeneration speed.
---
Dont bother with shields just dw tank her, she hits like a pussy and a shield wont mitigate breath damage (3-4k fire dmg, majority of her damage)
---
Turtles at lands end beach. Passive gold from grey shell fragments and the chance to get a golden pearl or two per grind trip if ya lucky. My friend funded his epic mount by casually doing this since launch
---
Yeah, they actually have them.
---
I’ll download that, thanks!
---
Lol is this a joke
---
The warlock discord's pvp guide has a 5/7/39 Conflag build that gets improved corruption, improved healthstone, the 15% stamina and rest is destro tree.
---
Also there are at least two SL(=Soul Link) builds. One going for Nightfall and Grim Reach and one getting some stuff in destro tree. SL is apparently OP in 1v1, since it has insane survivability.
---
I find alliance are the most scummy gankers on EU-Zandalar tribe
---
I'm baffled at all the stupidity I read in op's post. He's trying to find a reason as to why alliance were not fighting back and just correlated it to layers without any actual PROOF or even common sense lol.
---
It's simple. Hardcore pvpers want advantages, horde racials are advantageous, most hardcore pvpers roll horde thus even if the population IS even, the PvP one IS imbalanced.
---
I’ve played many games with strong South American communities and Brazilians are usually some of my favorite people to play with. 
---
You guys are always super funny and friendly. Love hanging out with y’all, if I spoke better (or any) Portuguese I’d totally join a Brazilian guild
---
Go to retail if you want to run into nearest red circle and aoe everything to quest. I love quests like this.
---
i remember using pots, flasks all the time (farmed myself in raid free time). Was always broke, but top dps all the time. Switched to Tanking later and finally started making some gold \^\^
---
Yes, people don't like queues and don't wanna transfer. Blizzard thinks it's better to have more populated servers. I don't think I agree with the maths, but that's basically why.
---
Twinks are mostly for BGs. More often than not the overall situation gets eventually so that both sides have almost every single players fully twinked in a particular bracket. This is probably the closest thing you'll ever get to a real balanced fight where skill, more than gear, will be the decisive factor. 
---
So within the context of BGs I think twinking gives probably the only means to really let skill shine through.
---
There was no question like that at all.
---
OP made a statement about how he doesn't understand why people just don't roll a new toon on a PvE server since he did and doesn't regret doing it.
---
And yes, me being invested in my characters, my guild and playing with my IRL friends is my reasons for not rolling a new toon on a PvE server. Is that not valid reasons to you? I should just invest more time in an alt starting from scratch, without the people that I enjoy playing with, on a new server just because?
---
There is only one spec till 51 lvl for leveling - arms. After 51lvl - any spec you prefer with 11 points in arms up to Anger managment
---
at lvl 52 you should have multiple zones to switch between.
---
WPL, Winterspring, Azshara (dunno if alliance have a lot of quests there), Felwood, Blasted lands, Burning steppes, Un'goro etc. All of them shouldn't be completely horde dominated unless you are on a really terrible server.
---
And if you are a lower lvl, you should just bitch at your 60s and tell to fix the fucking mess instead of AFKing in IF and just waiting for their weekly raid.
---
I think this is a quantity vs quality thing
---
My guess if there would be more pvp during phase 1, people on less represented faction would be more motivated to transfer out, creating even more disbalance on the servers than we have now.
---
Still that's just a guess and we will never know. What happened, happened, and it's pointless to discuss what ifs.
---
that somewere somehow was 15 years ago on vanilla. people were using nightfall bots back then.
---
Either Edgemaster's or Aged Core Leather Gloves (Mugger's Belt) together with a strong dagger (Perdition's or CHT)
---
You'll want at least 305 weapon skill and 6% hit with your combined gear and you'll be doing a lot more threat
---
I get ganked as horde pretty often...
---
When do new pvp ranks drop for the week? During maintenance ?
---
Well, where should I find the data on it?
---
Only Blizzard have that I suppose, how many layer switched per minute or whatever.
---
I know there was a fuckton, so I can just assume that I am correct.
---
Read the first line of your quote again. It is only visual.
---
16 runs for the robe. No drop. Bonescraper and Cape dropped 3 times each...
---
&gt; only 7 months
---
For today's life expectations for a meme it's damn close to a miracle to live that long.
---
Usualy you get id when trash is killed if bosses are already down
---
My waking life is literally 60% wow, 30% school and 9% excercise. 1% left over for the few times a month I actually do something social.
---
Thank fuck I'm going home soon for christmas/new years.
---
375 sp, 3k hp and he is not so hard with sm/DS (ds void) spec. Until he is 50% keep him max range and Los him as much as u can, when imps spawn you are unkillable with 5 drains up. Pots, offhand with heal and some consumables help ofc I usually go with trolls blood and armor pot, that is like 50s for one hour and gives u room for fuckup
---
You know he was probably bumpin some Rammstein for his pvp montage
---
I actually hoped that the undead and human that was sharing the mining node would stay friendly, I've always been mining in winterspring and there's a human rogue since p1- we've always let each be. Do the /wave and keep on respecting each other, even after p2! Feels like we both know were here only to farm gold, haha.
---
Hey, I am a holy paladin and I think fishing is a great profession. But the again I‘m on a pve realm so there‘s little combat for valuable spots. If you get fishing high enough you can even fish Essences of water in Azshara, but you need more than 400 fishing and even then it can fail. I‘ve been farming lots of food and mats for consumables with fishing too!
---
Having them log out means they never leave the instance tho
---
This is fair play.
---
Casual here. I been lvling a warrior for a bit and went back to retail for pvp (I still really like retail pvp), and I just found myself socializing with every group I get into now. I find that classic really does promote interaction with other players, maybe just for quests and dungeons at first, but it grows beyond that afterwords. I love you classic! &lt;3
---
Yeah, hypocrites usually complain loudest
---
Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time
---
The pet, probably "Leeroy..."
---
(I know it was feared, but it is so funny it went straight to Ony)
---
That how you get yourself a guild with no hunters.
---
This is what i do and it works 85-90% of the time ( i usally dump threat when the reaches 45-50% so i dont get fireballd again)
---
Same story for 15 years.. Both factions do the same things, but only Alliance whines around..
---
Afaik if you see an SL warlock in the wild you generally run away from them and not towards them ;)
---
Pop arcane pots and zerg him in 30 seconds. Deffs not a shit fight for melee.
---
This is what I thought all the PvP posts would be like. 
---
The fact it isn't is the reason I'm on a RP server.
---
Let's hope this starts a trend.
---
Because people are stupid and lazy...it's really THAT simple.
---
I wouldn't expect data, but I'd at least expect the shit to make logical sense.  Layers made the alliance soft, thus they're now complaining, is the most nonsensical thing I've read today.
---
Im one of the warriors always mining in ungoro. And i gotta say, ive killed a few hunters doing simone.
---
All the keybinds hurt my head
---
i would try to get rank 3 PvP for the 10% additional faction discount and save some more for the real epic mount  
---
IMO not really worth the effort and gold spent for the class mount
---
You can enable/disable war mode in SW or Org, which flags you for PvP and gives you access to a bunch of PvP talents.
---
If Venture left it's gone past me, since it feels like we are having a great time. Lots of horde to kill/ remove world buffs from. Have a great record on world bosses it might be hard to farm in the open/solo. 
---
Being out numbered just makes it more fun to reck horde guilds
---
People who complain about their server being overcrowded but still don't want to transfer just want to eat their cake and have it. I can't relate to this kind of a playerbase at all.
---
for lame ass baddies
---
Old guys unite!
---
I am so picking this up. Thanks!
---
&gt; But seriously. If you expect aw and naxx to be easy enough to allow enh shamans you're fooling yourself
---
But seriously. If you expect AQ and Naxx to be so hard that it's impossible to allow enh shamans you're fooling yourself
---
I think I am missing something or doing something wrong.
---
I was just raiding with my guild for the first time and my DPS wasnt as good as i wished.
---
I compared the logs with the other rogues in my guild and I missed quite a lot more sinister strikes than them. (My miss 11,11%, their miss between 3 and 7%) The amount casted is about the same and its not a single fight but through the whole MC?
---
I always thought yellow hits will always hit when reaching the hit cap? I dont really recall attacking the monster from the front alot either. Got a Gutgore Ripper so attack from front wont be a problem anymore as I respeced to Dagger now, but still did I do something wrong to have such a high missrate on sinister strikes?
---
My normal hits had the lowest missrate from all the rogues in that raid, so having enough hit% was definately not the problem.
---
There were also some other problems like not expending combo points before the monster dying and stuff that lowered my DPS, but that sinister strike missrate is bugging me the most.
---
Servers are too large. Meta is much different with tryhards and guides. Faction imbalances. Game is good if horde. Game is cancer for alliance.
---
Well they gave Information on larger Servers. At the same time they said that People will be leaving and Servers will be back to normal by P2.
---
So we got Information you are right. It was false Information afterall.
---
Still People try to blame things on People choosing PVP Server even though we could not have known
---
It was mistake for the people who are stuck being outnumbered on 80/20 pvp servers.
---
you don't want to know the best strat.
---
Well, look around. I think when all is said and done people will probably gladly forget about the recent weeks. 
---
Starting P2 without BGs was a big mistake. I understand #nochanges and all but let's not forget the only reason back in vanilla BGs also started later then P2 was because they had fallen behind with the schedule. Was never intended to for the two things NOT to start together. 
---
That Blizz reproduced the same mistake with Classic is beyond me. What a dumb move.
---
Im glad it isn't just me who sees that cat's face in the fish icon
---
on my server pvp is happening within these locations 24/7
---
I think mana management would be the main issue with multi ability macros
---
Prowl allows your pet to get to your target before they have a chance to CC it, which in most situations out weighs it getting there a bit slower
---
blink the intercept stun, polymorph until FAP wears off
---
Aight
---
Surely you dont think a smaller server would automaticly remove the hardcore gankers? it would just happen on a smaller scale and players would still be hunted.
---
this is basically an example that you cant please everyone no matter what you do, blizzard is literally just releasing vanilla as everyone asked. 
---
and yet they "fucked things up"
---
It most definitively hurt the playerbase, and as for me personally it made me much, much less interested in classic wow. Not wanting to log in and if I log in I mostly chat.
---
Our guild has killed Onyxia a total of around 65 times and we haven’t seen 1 viskag
---
It doesn't spill because you stack it.
---
Even this position is frankly dumb, but why is it you think this only applies to the alliance?
---
Someone told me recently warriors live or die by their crits. 
---
I respec'd and put 5 points in cruelty, focused on rend, deep wounds and improved overpower (adds 50% crit chance). 
---
My rotation is charge &gt; rend &gt; demoralizing shout &gt; sunder armor (repeat)
---
My focus is on getting as many attacks in as I can to proc crits and overpowers for more crits.
---
I don't have an issue with rage because crits generate more rage and I'm not dumping it into heroic strike.
---
All the pvp I've done the last week is when Alliance attacked the Orgrimmar gates lol
---
You are not addressing the problem here at all, just searching for a straw to grab to justify your own opinion...which is 100% wrong and irrelevant to the problem. Your cute little story of how you got ganked once and escaped doesn't change at all the fact that literally hudreds of thousands of people can't play the game right now and it's a horrible mistake that could have very easily be prevented by Actiblizz if only they didn't have their head stuck so far up the ass like you have.
---
I'm not.
---
also getting ganked by 3 nagas lmao scrub
---
Gold, absolute gold
---
Most servers are roughly equal in concurrent online to high pop vanilla servers but there are constant complaints here about servers being overpopulated.
---
weird, we must be on a different Mograine. I haven't seen any non-aggresive hordes since p2 at the very least, and very likely much longer than that
---
Sorry that you’re salty about rolling on a pvp realm.
---
Mine was really buggy as well early on. I don’t think I changed any settings, just started working with one of the patch updates
---
If this guy is ONLY spawnable inside the citys, thats just great!
---
Let them get what they deserve, especially the rooftop campers.
---
As a healer I have the same mindset, always trying to be ready for when that hunter backs into another pack of mobs or the warlock that tabs and dots everything in sight.
---
It was all in line of Blizzard expectations and predictions (and actually it was also predicted by players even in this sub).
---
&gt; We are fairly sure — we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest
---
Hey!
---
So I've got some questions regarding the Ragnaros-Fight in MC:
---
1. Raid-members should be spread out, due to the knockback. People are put together in pairs, because otherwise there wouldn't be enough space. How much should the range be between each pair? People were telling me that /range 18, so 18y wouldn't be enough and people would still be knockbacked by other pairs. I am a tank so I can't really check myself. What is the minimum range required between each pair?
---
2. What is your go to way to spread people out? Do you use any kind of map to assign a rough area to each group, because some of my people can't seem to figure it out on their own and to assign each pair their own space is kinda time consuming!
---
3. Can a healer be placed in the spot where the three melees are supposed to run when WoR is cast or could he technically being targeted with the range knockback and fuck the melees?
---
Thanks in advance for the help! You guys are awesome
---
I'll be sure to pop this the next time my crew gets zerged on the way to a dungeon
---
These people deserve it for being clueless, please introduce them to yeti and enjoy the salt. 
---
I thought it was common knowledge.
---
I get annoyed at that laugh
---
well, best flag carrier in terms of living the longest is druid, but a rogue using sprint goblin rocket boots and potion of swiftness gets in and out super duper quick. warrior's best role is in middle field, charging people attacking your fc and hamstringing them, shield bashing their casts, or hamstringing enemy fc. 
---
I think best 10 man is Druid, Priest(or sham for horde), Mage, Lock, Warrior(or pally for alli), hunter x 2 - 3, rogue x 2 - 3
---
You gave up imaginary friends but you still watch cartoons.... 😆😆👌📸
---
You can easily Tank up until BRD as an arms warrior with occasionally a shield.
---
At around lvl 55 you can think about switching to fullprot if you only dungeon grind or go with a (31 5 15 specc) if you want to quest along the way. (taking the 5 fury talents last) with this build you dont lack alot of dmg talents, but you still have 2 shieldblock stacks + last stand which is more than enough to tank every dungeon there is.
---
If you want I can send you the talents.
---
Nah it doesn't, we keep our lotus stash on our Officer who is an Alchemist.
---
Dude isn't hurting for cash, he was the first Lionheart recipe on our server.
---
Yes, most servers were back to normal by P2 and roughly equal to high pop vanilla servers indeed.
---
Servers which weren't normal are rare and Blizzard warned everyone to transfer out of it by p2. Those who still haven't transferred deserve everything related to their server being larger than vanilla one eventually so they have no right to complain.
---
Read the post again. Can't be used just anywhere.
---
Nothing to do with private servers. The gaming community has changed over the past 15 years. But keep spamming the same thing if it makes you feel better.
---
Content wont get that much harder
---
BWL will be cleared in &lt;40 minutes on launch
---
AQ40 will be cleared in sub-or-around 1 hour
---
Naxx will be cleared in ~2 hours.
---
War effort will on most servers be finished faster because the population and people already prepping now will speed it up tremendously
---
Prices for some consumables/materials is going to go up alot, while some will fall hard (elemental fire as a prime example)
---
On most servers PuGs/semi-PuGs will be organized for all content including Naxx.
---
Phase 3 and 4 is usually the "golden era" on private servers. BRM is the main raiding spot so guild vs guild pvp revolves strongly around there (but with how badly BRM lags in any large scale battle i dont know how it'll be here). ZG provides something to do, and is a great catchup mechanic for any alts / newer people. 
---
Once AQ40 launches and it becomes the new main raid, PvP "kinda" dies down. Mages and warlocks power - both in PvE and PvP - spikes something crazy and will with the raiding gear provided in this phase (p5) become the one shot style classes that many remember. This combined with more spread-out world objectives, be it farming, going to your dungeons/raids, the 6 world bosses, or queueing for BGs in capitals, means the world becomes a bit less alive than what we see now.
---
I believe that was a private server thing.
---
Underrated comment.
---
She is not that very tankable when your warriors are wearing 90% leather
---
Oh my god I actually saved that item after I got wondering if I'll ever find a use it in the future. Thank you for this post, I'm definitely going to fuck around with it now.
---
Copy from the post OP linked.
---
&gt; Debuffs work on a system of 5 prioritizations. The higher priority debuff will always knock off a lower priority debuff and works upwards from the bottom. A Taunt will try to knock off a trash debuff (Deeps Wounds, Fireball Dot) then a DoT (Corruption, SW:P) then a Medium (Vulnerabilities, Ignite, Vamp Embrace) then a High (Curses, Sunder, Demo, Thunderclap) if the debuff limit has already been reached.
---
&gt; Highest:
---
&gt; CC / Roots (Sheep / Seduce / Sap / Gouge / Frost Nova etc)
---
&gt; Taunt effects (Taunt, Mocking Block) (I've also read somewhere that Taunts get a special bonus debuff slots but can't confirm that)
---
&gt; High:
---
&gt; Curses
---
&gt; Sunder
---
&gt; Tclap / Thunderfury
---
&gt; Demo
---
&gt; Faerie Fire
---
&gt; Hunter's Mark
---
&gt; Judgements
---
&gt; Medium:
---
&gt; Vulnerabilities (Winter's Chill, Shadow Weaving, etc)
---
&gt; Ignite
---
&gt; Gift of Arthas
---
&gt; Vamp Embrace
---
&gt; Hunter Stings
---
&gt; Deadly Poison
---
&gt; Mortal Strike
---
&gt; Low:
---
&gt; DoTs, Longer duration = high priority
---
&gt; Trash:
---
&gt; Fireball Dot, Deep Wounds, weapon proc debuffs
---
Dont join ZT as Horde though or you are in for a ride (or run)
---
Is no one going to acknowledge this absolute unit’s username?
---
you realy dont know how it works, do you.
---
it scanns as i said, every few seconds a maximum of 50 people
---
it stores there level, race and time of recording as a list in a file
---
a few seconds later it searches "via the /who command" the next people and stores this again, 
---
this continues (depanding on people online) a few hours till the addon scanned every player online in every level range.
---
when it finishes you have a file in your wow folder thats containing all the info in it
---
when you upload that list, the server you are uploading to searches for the people of your list in its database and updates them if you have newer data of them.
---
when you upload a file to the server it will tell you (after it finishes updating its database) how many new people were added and how many people were updated
---
to come back to my "assumption", yes, it takes a few hourse to scann a server, because the /who comand got limited to this
---
Rooftop campers rarely use AOE and it's kinda pointless to waste honor rank of a character which is bound to be banned anyway.
---
Hahah get fucked alliance.
---
1. Pairs is fine and range /18 is more than enough 
---
2. Mark the healers so you can see everyone has one in range of them, all ranged dps spread around the entire circle
---
3. Can’t have anyone with a mana bar with the melle, this includes dps shaman and cat dps
---
Why people making this a Horde thing? It weren't fellow hordies that killed me when I landed in Un'Goro and it isn't the Horde that has been camping Dire Maul for weeks now. (Firemaw EU)
---
That would simply fuck people over not doing bg's.
---
Longer BG q's for the world "pvp"ers means more raidcamping people trying to get to dungeons, leveling, farming etc.
---
An asshole in a bg cant corpsecamp you running to brd.
---
&gt;The numbers are secondary to actually playing the game.
---
You sound like playing the game your way is the only legitimate way to play the game. which is not surprising since you sound very self-centered.
---
This is probably due to the fact that moste of the top rankers are in those guilds
---
I can't be the only one who genuinely enjoys supporting other classes?
---
[https://www.wowdownrank.com/](https://www.wowdownrank.com/)
---
Damn I turned this quest in for the 5g. I did use the yeti on the npc in Un'Goro right after I got ganked by 3 alliance.
---
I love being called upon as a tank.
---
I also get phone dial vibes from this :)
---
At some point you might just end up decreasing their size, tossing them in a corner and changing alpha to 0 in order to not have them block stuff on your screen!
---
You can just report the rooftop campers. Every time I see one on Mograine, I tell everyone around me to report them as blizzard will hand out 3 day bans for that. It really cuts down the amount of players hanging out on the roof.
---
It's called PvP for a reason, what are people expecting, honestly.
---
You fucking legend, well played.
---
People who thought they could just play the game without contesting objectives got a slap in the face, and the reactions are quite funny.
---
P2 should honestly have been the launch, this is how the game should have been on day 1.
---
Ive played since the start on pvp servers only. Never got camped in the first contested zones. 
---
Only killed every now and then.
---
No i dont think so. 
---
Because it bothers me too much that it takes me 30-40m to get to instances and the fact that i cant farm herbs in the open world. Pve is not an alternative at all.
---
No i dont. I think its a part of the game i used to like to do every now and then.
---
I have every screenshot i took in vanilla still and it was NOT like this AT ALL back then. People were kinder and respected the opposing factions players. And 1v1s were mich more common. Ofc there were roaming ganksquads, but even they left you alone after a few kills and moved on.
---
I visit this Reddit mostly for the memes though.

---
so you're crying "BOOOHOOO" about being wPvP'd and want to punish horde for this?!?! Right, why dont you QQ more and just enjoy BGs as they were in classic when cross realm BGs were introduced.
---
Lmao
---
I wish I never finished this quest holy shit.
---
Yeah, and fuck up the server he is on even more?
---
Probably hit you in the loading screen
---
Coincidally, I tried to finish the quest regularly at the start of phase 2 as I never bothered to do so before, but hordes kept killing me while doing it and prevented me from completing it. The amount of /spit after they killed me was weird, which made me investigate this further and has led to this post now.
---
I think you can't really blame Blizzard for making a phase 2: if you have been here before release (and even during phase 1) there was so many people posting #nochange and telling how much fun world PvP was.
---
If they had released BG immediately, it would have been such an uproar of "you steal the most fun phase of the game from us" that it was probably better to put it in place so at least people could see what it was.
---
Even better, make the honorless target buff viewable by the enemy faction, make it renew with double the previous timer if hit with any hostile spell or attack, make it not tick down during CC (sheep, sap, etc) and make it count as a DK when the target is killed with the buff.
---
You just sapped that person landing at the FP? Now their honorless target duration is 1 minute and doesn't start ticking down until sap wears off. Someone else sheeps them? Now it's 2 minutes.
---
sry but i´m actually horde on a horde heavy pvp server.
---
that doesnt mean i like the state of the game as it is atm.
---
the point is, i want the game to live for many years and this state of the game in most servers is not helping!
---
tell me (guessing ur horde also by your comment) but do you think ull have a great gameplay experience if we aint got no alliance to speak of in most servers?
---
I did that the week before p2. And you're right it's great... however now? Idk.
---
I am shook, that level of cringe is unimaginable
---
so you just abandon your chars once theyre lvl 60?
---
Such bullshit. Horde who can't handle dying twice will transfer off the realm but the good horde (shout-out to Philsonator and his friends) will put teams together and fight off alliance no problem.
---
Czech Division merged with polish guild Heavy Drinkers, to gain enough raiding power. I have not found reliable source for current population, nor information about big guilds leaving. I was wpvp with members of Venture yesterday. Can you elaborate which guilds left and where?
---
He is somewhat right though. Even I doubt it would add to the server strain though.
---
Deleting the cache will require you to fetch the full information everytime you encounter something, instead of reading from the cache. This increases the information passed from the server.
---
I doubt it's enough to actually impact the servers. But if you have a slow connection you might encounter slower loadins (not loading screens). Slower inspect times and such things, new models etc.
---
Only Blizz has the correct data (obviously)  but just based on [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/512992690263031828/616169771917901834/20190828_091816.jpg) a "medium" server is *well in excess* of the fullest vanilla servers. So imagine a what a "High" and even more a "Full" pop realm might be now.
---
But the mounted knights are the only ones who DO attack people? 
---
Maybe stand closer if u need guard protection?
---
Netflix is not a fucking hobby.
---
Patchwerk was never a dps fight tho. Patchwerk is a healer fight. All about keeping people alive. 
---
And if you sustained 10k dps for Patchwerk then you are at atleast 25k on golemagg. Big difference of a three minute fight versus a 40 second fight. And we still don't know what Patchwerks armor and resistance values are.
---
And yes, people should do a lot more damage than required for bwl now. Since are using 1.12 talents and itemization. But bwl will require a lot more coordination and a lot less slacking
---
Yup
---
He probs means the elite questgiver Marshal Whatever his name is (I forget his name but it's not Windsor)
---
If you think servers are/are close to the same size as they were in vanilla, then I doubt you played vanilla. 
---
I’m somebody who is all for pvp, be it world or battlegrounds, but currently what pvp servers are going through is most certainly not the vanilla experience, it’s the private server experience. 
---
World pvp where groups of 5-10 may meet each other in the world is fine and well, but this current meta of 40man raids sitting camping diremaul, lhc, Brm, scholomance, flight paths in higher level zone... it’s just toxic. 
---
I really don’t want to blame blizzard, but what I will say is, the scale of the game world, was not designed for this many players, and raising the amount of players per realm by as much as it was, was the wrong choice when more realms at launch would have been a better option.
---
What faction?
---
Yeah, don't bring the strongest ranged DPS right now to raids, guys.
---
No, people who try to label others as "not belonging in classic" don't belong in classic you fucking gatekeeper.
---
As much as it might suck, you might as well get some rep for any of the factions.
---
Timbermaw is super contested but if you can get a 5 man group, you can grind rep super fast. I went from unfriendly to friendly in 2 hours with a 5 man and leveled twice.
---
Same here, I always jump around and never attack first when I see one but they always attack.
---
Awesome man! I had the same with other hunters when they saw me attempting the quest. They would cheer me on, not interrupt me etc when trying to do it. It's like we have some code of honor amongst the hunters. This was also at the Silithus one.
---
Remove experience from quest mobs now that dungeons are out
---
I remember flying away from spells
---
&gt; ITT: People who think - any - warrior or hunter will willingly sit there and spam wing clip/hamstring and hold 1 weapon for the rest of the game. The kinds of people who seek to bring this kind of raid utility aren't playing those classes...
---
It's a good way to gain GDKP/DKP and favours later on.
---
Swing around and hit their healers. Then sit back and laugh.
---
You shouldn't be using heroic strike when tanking except for dumping excess rage. You should be spending 90% of your rage on spaming sunder, shieldblock, revenge (and shieldslam if proc spec).
---
 Morgan's Vigil, Alliance's FP in Burning Steppes.
---
Pfff  that Statement by Blizzard is full of crap.
---
You just have to look at the honor Rankings on most all Server right now.
---
I had 5 HK's last week (playing on a medium Pop german Server) and got rank 6784. Meaning 6783 ALLIANCE Players were in front of me. 
---
Meaning that Servers are way fuller than the fullest classic Server ever was.
---
Sry but there is every right to complain.
---
I wouldn't just force feed myself Blizzard Statements and blindly believe them to be true m8. You will realize how full of shit those Statements usually are :)
---
Just like "2 German PVP Servers + 1 PVE will be enough":
---
You see I don't even blame Blizzard nobody can anticipate how many People want to Play classic beforehand. 
---
I just blame them for the current Situation because this could have been handled way better so we would have far less Problems now. 
---
I just Level my alt - I'm happy that way. I just try to get People to stop talking crap
---
I played on initially on Flamelash on release, lvled my paladin to 40, and the server was already shit back then so I cut my losses. (it was below 40% alliance back then)
---
It was a fantastic decision apparently, only played on relatively well balanced servers since.
---
my warlock gettin ganked by night elves at Everlook when canping the pattern says otherwise
---
Cdl allows all 4 totems every duel atm
---
Because I will use it against their incessant campers
---
Dishonourable kill
---
probaly will be hotfixed for reset
---
Private servers were better AND free haha fuck blizzard
---
Time you wasted having fun is not wasted.
---
Correct-ish. While heroic strike in of itself adds a big chunk of threat, its not worth it threat-per-rage-point-wise because you're essentially robbing yourself of a rage generating auto attack.
---
Heroic strike should only be used for dumping excess rage. Nothing else.
---
Haha I have played Classic and plenty of pservers. 
---
I had fun in World PVP because you could actually Play.
---
Hell even 200v200 fights were possible. WPVP today is just ganking lowbies in Groups of 5-10 People. Respect for that!
---
I dont blame People for farming honor. But please stop talking bs
---
Not sure why downvoted. N.W.A use it as a lyric in several tracks from the 80s. Including actually explaining the meaning. lol.
---
"Ganked means getting took for your bank  
---
Or your gold or your money or something"
---
Level 60 ganking newbs on a boat and then winning a "1v1" vs meme class using mind control.
---
AMAZIN'
---
I never got this problem, over all my years of playing. If you get ganked once, you just release x yards away, and go somewhere else. Problem solved.
---
How many corpseruns did it take you to get into brd?
---
I would recommend cepgp as it lets everyone get a chance on loot but ive heard about gdkp that sounds cool altough that system can carry a risk to it
---
Well if thats what they do yea but I doubt many families of WoW players do.
---
No issues
---
It's amazing if used correctly and utterly garbage if used badly. The gap is quite wide.
---
How did the paladin do so much damage? Shockadin spec?
---
Thanks! :) Working on Deadmines atm
---
200 vs 200 is an awful way to farm honor, how come you don't know that after saying you played before?
---
&gt; If they didn't give wpvp a chance, there would have been endless complaints from the people that somehow believe wpvp isn't dog shit.
---
I think it's the main reason: I can't even imagine if Blizzard stated "honor without BG can not work in 2019, so we're skipping that phase.
---
There would have been such an uproar...
---
The point of a rage dump is that it converts your auto hit to a special hit, it works on the auto attack table which is separate from instant attacks. Thus the termp of "dumping" rage, because you dont gain any from it.
---
Rage dumps: Cleave and Heroic strike.
---
&gt; A shaman would just need really good gear and 5/5 shield spec. Preferably a lot of points in elemental instead of enhance for more threat so dps can actually nuke to kill the boss as soon as possible.
---
Yup, Icy Veins has a write up that talks about shaman tanking in Classic and its suggest to go ele for the extra threat.
---
\&gt; Horde camping lbrs
---
:D
---
Yeah my warrior buddy has one and uses a few pieces of healing gear with it and barely needs a healer in PvP. It pumps heals and does good damage to boot.
---
We currently swapped over to LC since DKP management got difficult across our multiple groups when some officers stepped down due to IRL work load. Only had it for a short while so difficult to say how it will turn out eventually, but from what I can say on a short notice - the officer crew are really pushing to make it as transparent and fair as possible, and since we're just transitioning now there's also room for discussion if someone feels why a piece should go to X, Y or Z or why it might be better for class A or B. First contact with LC for me, and I've read a lot of horror stories about it in the case of very corrupt LCs. 
---
I really think DKP is the most fair and transparent system of all, though. If you think you "waste" 3 weeks with DKP, then you just don't appreciate the system or understand it. If you've not looted anything in 3 weeks you're likely to have more DKP than most, unless you join a guild that's existed for months on end. In that case, however, many people have probably gotten some of the pieces you're interested in. Banking on DKP for a bit is a great way to have others drain their DKP on pieces you might not want so badly, and giving you a better position for when your top prio items actually do drop. The most "unfair" part of it may be that it promotes activity (if you miss a raid, you're out so and so many DKPs) and that you can't perceivably win a piece every week as you can with /roll systems - but I personally hate roll systems as they are too random, nothing you do during your raids can improve your odds as it's the roll of a die. Yes, there are systems which address this to some extent (gdkp, your -10 for future rolls) but bottom line is still that it's random. Not a system for me.
---
Wow thats perfect, Thank you!
---
"Bitch and moan"?
---
Hah you're so egocentric!
---
&gt;Meaning 6783 ALLIANCE Players were in front of me
---
No, it doesn't mean that. Do you see a crucial flaw in your logic or you still need me to point it out for you? You lowkey even have a sub-answer to it in your own post though.
---
&gt; especially single-target, and it can fit good tank talents into an optimal solo questing build, too.
---
I'd recommend checking out Caperfin's guide on shaman tanking, it goes pretty in-depth and explains how to raid tank.
---
I played on a pve server, because I knew the shitshow that it was going to become and didn't want 'nam flashbacks of STV.
---
It definitely was close to this in vanilla before battlegrounds were released my friend except it was always alliance advantage from all the human players
---
They basically did it so they get to say "You think you do, but you don't" and be correct for once.
---
I've tried doing this with completely quitting the game, relaunching the client and then rezzing, didn't get honor less debuff. How do you get it to work? Do you log off (I.e. character screen) or completely quit the server?
---
Everlook if all places, seems to be the only place alliance don't get ganked to hell.
---
Suppose its because its god actual working guards. So the horde can't easily camp inside the town.  How's searing gauge at your server lulz?
---
Fuck off to a PVE server if you cant handle being killed ;-)
---
Mainly because horde racials are OP in PvP, a lot of the servers are more Horde than Alliance, so it ends up being one way fights into molten core for example and people are getting camped.
---
I tried this yesterday, it just gave me a 30 sec res timer after each relog. Is there a trick to it, like timing?
---
Well you can inv some one, log out, jump on an alt, have them inv the alt, reset, log into your main and be in a reset instance. 
---
Fairly sure my rogue buddy does this for pp
---
Details, with Tiny Threat.
---
640g for it at rank3.  The regular mount will be like 800g.  I heard that the rank 11 mount is 90g?  Maybe it's 80g?  idk
---
Locks do more damage than mages on single target fights, assuming they don't get fucked by resist rng.
---
We are doing left/right splits with 20-25 people, and usually have 5-8 healers depending on who's on. Raid damage is not very overwhelming during P2, as there is so much space to spread out. We keep 1-2 mages per side, and if we get more than 3-4 whelps, they swap to AoEing them down so they drop fast.
---
Tank tries to pool rage for her low 40s, and pops a rage pot if needed when she lands. Ranged chill from 41-42ish.
---
Nope, you're not dumb.
---
You can find the probability of looting at least one sword by subtracting the probability you don't get any from 1, and because each kill has an independent chance of dropping the sword, the probability of not getting a single drop in *n* kills equals the probability of not getting the drop in one kill raised to the *n*-th power, so 0.9995^1400 = 0.4965.
---
That gives that the chance of getting at least one sword is 1 - 0.4965, or 0.5035, meaning if you killed baron 1,400 times, you'd have a 50.35% chance of looting the sword on at least one kill.
---
I´ve looted probb around 80 dusty tomes since i started farming lashers upon hitting level 60 and to this day i got fewer than 10 class books and no forors.
---
That's exactly how the blood plague started.
---
&gt;the amount of insults, harassments and death threats I received from hordes via the servers' discord is astonishing.
---
&gt;Some of them got so pissed off that they've quit the game from what their guild mates have told me.
---
 Please tell me you have screenshots.
---
If your horde, carful about going gnomeregan. The little fucks who run to the lift outside the instance are civilians.
---
I went the day the honor system cam out and a level 60 was boosting a group of us there, all of a sudden one of the party members started going to town on the civilian gnomes trying to escape.
---
The level 60 was not impressed.
---
As a horde mostly deep prot warrior who probably has more PvP deaths in P2 than HKs (which I only really get from group members killing people), can I get instant queue BGs so I can farm my don julios ring for raiding?  I think it only makes sense since I pretty much auto-lose whenever I see alliance by myself.  I am a real shitter in world PvP so I would like to farm PvE in AV for rep to make up for it.
---
This means 6783 alliance CHARACTERS are in front of you. If you fail to see the difference between a player and a character (1 player can create up to X characters, 1 player usually doesn't sit in game 24/7 and the average daily /played in classic isn't expected to be a lot etc. etc.) then I rest my case.
---
The statement there are " 6783 ALLIANCE Players" in front of you is a blatant lie and you should be ashamed for even using it as an argument.
---
And you can do the other stuff you want because you're part of the dominant faction. Alliance players don't get that luxury.
---
I bring 56 to raid😅
---
My guild did our first 20 man Onyxia last weekend. I was the offtank, and our better geared GM was the main tank, we tried and wiped about 3 times, but we found success when we threw away the notion of multiple tanks, and had the Main tank on phase 1 and phase 3. Whilst I just caught some pesky whelps. As the Offtank I did have moments where I picked up threat in phase 3, but swapping between two tanks was fine for our healers to deal with. And it wasn’t part of the plan. Not sure how helpful this is, but it certainly made our raid mindset easier when we just considered one main tank
---
its certainly a W
---
Actually the only plate shoulders with hit that are plate are rank 10 PvP or AQ40 for example. It would be really hard to hit cap with plate only. There is a reason everyone wants true strike shoulders.
---
You must be really low rank to waste time doing this lol.
---
Can someone explain to me how DHK works?
---
Like what is the consequence of a DHK
---
&gt; Make sure everyone has Greater Fire pots
---
There is 0 reason to use these even with 20 man split runs (we do 15 - 18 players). If you feel you need them it's time for better healers.
---
Alright, so you agree, you refuse to fix the issue, you just want to complain about it.
---
Good one.
---
Seen it 3 times and lost it 3 time to a hunter
---
Don't even answer to a comment by scummy shits like /u/PitifulPlastic they are only here to troll because - even though they are Horde on a Horde dominated Server - they are still too bad to Play the game which is why he spends his time on reddit.
---
Trying to make People mad - like trolls do.
---
Just ignore him and we will have a nice day cutting himself
---
What hole?
---
You magnificent son of a b\*\*\*h! You did it!
---
I just get close to pre raid BIS and start on an alt.
---
Oh. Bane. I read baine and was thinking "I do t see any tauren resemblance" XD
---
Three should be enough?  
---
Warlock +2
---
Yes, yes and yes.
---
He did it. The crazy son of a bitch did it.
---
Why would he reroll, is night elf much better at lvl 60? He is probably gonna continue with levelling
---
I'm so going to do this 24/7 until bgs come out. Fuck the horde lmao.
---
Fourth is the one you summon. With 3 you need external help if you want to summon yourself or juggle warlocks around to farm shards.
---
The rage is so real...  i felt your anger as I keeped reading down the post!
---
FYI: i skip this on none range toons.  I hate this quest with all my soul.
---
I'm rank 5, 80%, which is above average for this week in EU. Ranking as alliance on a horde dominated server is actually rather easy so far, thank you for your input.
---
Servers are too full. Obviously much more population compared to Vanilla. Like 3 times more, on most servers, and 4 times more on the most popular ones.
---
I played on a High pop server in Vanilla, and I play on a High pop server in Classic.
---
There is no comparison : the High Classic server pop is vastly, vastly higher. Easily 3 times higher.
---
And when my server goes to Full (which it does 2-3 times a week), you can't throw a needle in Orgrimmar without hitting a player.
---
Considering the first example isn't even against the rules; while the latter is - makes it quite logical, doesn't it?
---
Been tanking her with my shaman. Only danger is her breath, her melee swings are pathetic.
---
Will gnomish rocket boots work while affected by Warrior's Hamstring? I tried using them for the first time yesterday and I was still moving slow. Due to the gank I couldn't, at the moment, determine if they malfunctioned or if the slow was preventing them from working correctly.
---
Lol cant upvote this enough
---
Chuky gnome is not real he can’t hu...
---
People use pouch on 60 :)
---
Yeah well MC is so easy we’re practically doing it with our eyes closed. Currently we’re only 2 locks in the raid and 1 shadow priest. The other warlock does CoE. I’m supposed to do CoS or CoR. But now we’re just having fun so I can CoA instead to cheese for logs.
---
Come progress again in BWL we’re obviously doing the correct debuffs and curses again.
---
Fuck the police!
---
NWA was great!
---
.. Or otherwise you'll end up like your dead beat father!
---
You should wait 60 to be honest. But you have a very nice pvp class hehe
---
Yep yep been doing my part to make Tanaris a living hell for the Alliance 20k honor in two days solo, thanks Alliance.
---
Level to 60.
---
This is brilliant, well done sir.
---
Anything with fel domination + master summoner for double void sacrifice. But it's unlikely you'll encounter wpvp where this will make any difference.
---
How can you be shit of all you have to do is press 1 button?
---
Haha xD
---
Sorry for "lying" :P 
---
I think you very well know what I meant and you know - I'm german.
---
Then it is 6783 alliance characters in front of me which even if we'd say every Person has 2 Character which he farms honor with. Give a larger Population than the largest classic Server which makes my Point still Standing.
---
And you have wasted your time concentrating on a language error which you feel very proud of now!!
---
I would say it probably means that there is ~4000 alliance PLAYERS in front of me. Given that Horde is dominating I'll say that they at least have the same amount of Players. 
---
Giving 8k - which is approximately double the size of a large classic Server.
---
Which brings us back to you having to give an Argument that is not base on a language barrier.
---
Go ahead pls
---
Uh. Ok?
---
Fiery is ppm based though, so while a faster weap will reduce the time before it procs it won't really make it proc more often.
---
If half the population moves away, you get what you want and they get what they want. Win win.
---
It will cross the world and catch you in IF for a sweet 1500crit
---
&gt; It helps to reduce the required bandwidth immensely, as you only need to receive the ID for an item rather than the entire item itself.
---
I don't think that is the case it all.
---
Avoid the shit show and spam AV for Don Julio's band instead.
---
Classic servers are 3 to 4 times bigger than the biggest Vanilla servers.
---
It's obvious for whoever played both Vanilla and Classic.
---
As a Vanilla player and Classic player, on High pop servers, Classic "High" is easily 3 times more populated than a Vanilla "High".
---
Go to another server that not over populated.
---
Minorities are not allowed to transfer, at least its the case for shazzrah.
---
Dude! You're the best!!
---
Except the servers were roughly balanced by the time server transfers were introduced, the imbalance was created because of the transfers to safe havens THEN blizzard changed the transfers to faction specific ones.
---
I don't think that happened till the end of vanilla.  Plus I hate kodos cuz they don't fit in doors, which is why I'll likely buy the av wolf.
---
To avoid the wPVP fest its the best racial Immo.
---
What's your server?
---
Jumping down from Awbee's balcony?
---
Peggle sucks, they need bust a move or something
---
Her only real decent hit is from her Fire Breath, which doesn't take armor into account.
---
Yeah it's pretty scary how quickly it can affect you, weeks work can be outdone in minutes in one raid on SW/OG etc.
---
Too long and grainy video. Do you have a TLDW?
---
You instantly lose rank points (as in the "exp" bar you see behind your rank in the honor tab). I only know that the first kill every day gives you -100 which is 2% for any rank above 2, however AFAIK you lose more and more for every subsequent DHK on the same day.
---
1 rogue to protect the fc 1 rogue to assail the enemy fc, or one rogue on rocket boot cap duty and one rogue on murder duty
---
&gt;most servers had 3-4 layers of players, each layer with a number higher than the highest Vanilla servers, which were at 3-3.5k.
---
Yes, that's correct but only at launch with 5+ layers per server. This is where population comparison at launch comes from.
---
Servers now have 1 layer. 9-12k players trying to login would result in a 3k-6k queues and I don't see it happening.
---
A very important question which seems to be the reason of your misunderstanding of the whole situation:
---
Do you understand delayering of a server (layers removal) LOWERED the concurrent online cap for this server?
---
this is a motherfucking copypasta, isnt it?
---
see this is how you counterplay the ganking.  pity this post wasnt made weeks aog
---
Calm down satan!
---
Nah let‘s be real now: this is a rly smart usage of a game mechanic and it seems to be allowed so well played.
---
Reroll on a PvE server. There's still time to level and enjoy the content.
---
DHK is obtained by killing NPC with the tag "civilian". Killing low lvl players is not relevant to DHK.
---
When you get a DHK, you lose some honor rating. If you are rank 4 with no progress toward tank 5, you will fall down to rank 3 with almost enough progress toward rank 4. The more DHK you get in one day, the more severe loss. So the one raid getting hit by 5 in a row might have went from rank 5 to rank 2 and a half or something, they lost a lot.
---
Pre raid-bis: I'm about to end this mans whole career.
---
The dude hit rank 11, stated the time took about 4-5 weeks to get from rank 8-11 then manages to go from rank 11- rank 1 with 500 DHKs in a few hours.
---
Fuck me, didn't even realize.
---
&gt;Most servers now have 3-4 times the population of the biggest Vanilla servers.
---
You might want to post a source of this (but only if it differs from "dude trust me" ofc).
---
Nice One !
---
Hey guys how about you move to a minority server and not  do anything other than corpse runs, instead of being able to do all open world content and farming honor by tab fireblast spamming while you are mastrubating to chinese cartoon girls on your second monitor?
---
1: 13 is the AoE size but most /range dont give you the option. 
---
2: we place healers around the area and then have rdps spread around them to use max area size. Even though not ideal we use the whole area and with a GFPP for p1 we normally dont worry about ending up in lava from the knockback. 
---
3: No as Rag will target anyone with a mana bar and cause the whole group to go flying. (What you said in your second spot). The safe zone for WoR is to close to not result in your melee going airborn.
---
I was not aware, this is brilliant I gotta give it to ya!
---
Well played.
---
that isnt that bad to be honest. 1 DHK is -60?
---
To be fair all the content around classic has become shit.
---
You're the perfect ally huh? Safe spaces on campus weren't enough now Blizzard should implement them in WoW. GTFO. Take your own advice and stop paying to play this toxic game. Probably throwing your chakras all out of alignment. I don't have first-hand experience of what that must be like but I have eyes and a brain so thoughts and prayers bud.
---
People like you are fine, its the people who camp every ally transport who are super annoying. Im only lvl 40, and I still get ganked by 60s on the boats or on the tram.
---
Mage is much better at getting flag then rogue tbh, and hunter or lock can protect the fc but depends on enemy comp of course. Vs a pug it hardly matters
---
AITA?
---
If you kill an NPC marked as a civilian, you will get a DHK. This doesn't effect the amount of honor you gained for the week, it instead immediately reduces your rank by a small amount. Because it reduces rank points and not honor it can be quite punishing as you can always grind out some more honor, but there's a maximum to the amount of rank points that can be gained each week.
---
Pros:
---
* Gives max leveled, BiS characters something to do besides farming gold or leveling an alt
---
* Encourages grouping
---
* Creates interest in retail for ranked/skilled PvP
---
* Existed in vanilla
---
* Fun for people who enjoy getting something for nothing, probably
---
* 5v5s, 10v10s, even 20v20s feel great on either side
---
* Allows those hardstuck Rival players to feel good at "PvP" for once
---
Cons:
---
* Very unbalanced sides, even on some well-balanced realms.
---
* No one likes getting piled on by 3-15 people at a time
---
* Unbalanced as a whole
---
* Over-hunting of low-pop faction is already leading to decline in player base.
---
* Dead servers possibly already on the horizon if this continues in P3
---
* Not fun for most people, I'd imagine
---
Honestly, I thought I would love Classic PvP; I've always loved PvP since I started playing in TBC. World PvP, random battlegrounds, dueling, arenas, rated BGs, I did it all and loved it all. But this is just not fun, plain and simple. I've been on both sides of every PvP encounter imaginable from 1v1s to 80v80s to 1v5s and 5v1s and the only time I actually really enjoy it is in those small, even numbered skirmishes somewhere (Or when you kill someone trying to gank you). It's not fun, rewarding, challenging or stimulating in any way when things are lopsided to the point of hyperbole like that, it honestly makes me wonder what type of player enjoys those 10v1s. But then I remember that a lost of Classic and Private server players thought resilience ruined PvP and I just have to laugh it off.
---
He's talking about the one you use DURING the quest, not the quest reward.
---
Omg thats so smart im gonna do this all day.
---
They can shape shift to a mana bar stance just after the Fireball comes out. It has a ~15sec CD on it before he pops it again.
---
Killing NPCs marked as civilians, designated as such due to their low level but essential functions (usually as quest givers), results in a DHK that instantly removes a chunk of rank points (honor) from everyone in the party that was in range of the civilian that died. I haven't been able to tell how hard they chunk you in classic so far, but on private servers just a single one could set you back by quite a bit. My buddy was instantly de-ranked from mid Sergeant to low Corporal when we accidentally killed one of the civilian gnomes above Gnomeregan on Kronos if I remember correctly.
---
This is what I’m doing. But I have to keep disconnecting from work network, connect to guest, then back to work whenever I need to do some work related tasks.
---
So I’m thinking about getting a cheap laptop as well.
---
We'll see, I'll notify you if I ever get vanned.
---
It's probably one of the few recipes that doesn't taste bland, seeing how most of them is just 1 ingredient + spices.
---
vs pug never matters, then again who knows I play on herod, and so far horde side im one of like 50 different 19s so far. Just a whole hell of a lot. maybe there will be so many 19 twinks that every game is 10v10 lol
---
A dishonorable kill is awarded when you kill an NPC that is marked as a civilian (usually quest NPCs and other low level NPCs.) Unlike the other replies say, it is not a reduction in honor for the week. It is a reduction in Rank Points that is applied *immediately*. At level 60, you lose 100 RP when you kill a civilian. You can lose ranks by doing this. For reference, the top honor earning person earns 13,000 RP for the week.
---
I heard engineers can build new ones, that true?
---
You son of a bitch. I'm in.  ...Not really, just saw an opening for this line.
---
fucking hell man this is some good shit
---
Hello? Servers were multi layers. When they removed the layer system they made one out of all the existing layers (in ZT there were 2 layers iirc, probably more in others).
---
Anyway that pic provides the evidence you required. If you want to ignore it and try to be right regrdless go ahead. Doesn't really change anything to me but stop putting out wrong data.
---
Greater fire pots are way too expensive (10g) to be used on Ony which can be done without any buffs.
---
Don't know whether to upvote or downvote lol...
---
leveling one as fast as i can
---
I don't remember ever being denied on requests to restore items, dungeon looting mistakes (if everyone in party agreed), etc. Not that I've done it often but this hands-off approach was never a thing.
---
31 in demonolgy, grab soullink and fel domination. Rest in Affli. With 2x Sacrifice + SL youre so tanky you can just Dot and wait til they die. Maybe Drain Life if you feel kinky
---
Im just trying to complete the quest while the horde pvping there. Its not my problem.
---
Was thinking the same, that would be delicious.
---
Is this only during the quest? Once its finished it wont work even tho I still have the yeti?
---
I mean it seems backwards in the clip, he had agility gloves equipped while mounted, and swapped to mount speed when dismounting?
---
One hoop. The hoop is "Play on the server where this issue is already fixed".
---
Don't ruin things for other people because you refuse to apply the solution.
---
Has there ever been even one single war in the history of the universe that was determined based on a kill ratio?
---
I'll answer that for you. No, there has not been such a war. That isn't how any of this works.
---
Well, it depends. On my server, more like half of alliance left or are just raid loging (me too, after 2 weeks in P2). In my guild number of our 55+lvl went from 55+- to 20. Those who left didnt login since P2. Those who had 30-40lvl and got to 48+ stopped afterwards. We are trying to recruit ppl, but no luck so far, people are in guild or there are minimum or none without guild who wanna join us, so we could have guild raiding again. My sub ends somewhere near end of the month. So I will check BGs, observe situation and when the time of renewal sub comes, i will leave it be or cancel it.   
---
I was looking forward to Player vs Player, or 2v2, 5v5, unfortunately it literaly turned out to be Raid vs Player or Raid vs Party.  
---
What pisses me off too, is that we had big community of spanish players (like allmost half of all alliance community), our server was kinda like 50:50 or 40:60, then blizz made them server and they all moved away...I'd rather read spanish than have 30:70 server...  
---
PS: Someone knows how opening AQ gates works? Is it even possible to open, when Horde drives off all alliance from their server?
---
Fair enough, just wanted to point out that ferals are OK, but once out of kitty form Ragnaros notices they have a mana bar and might choose to Lava burst them if the timing is bad. Should've been more thorough, cheers for covering that part!
---
Yes. I have noticed some semi-regular massacres around Menethil Harbour that go on until a 60 or two come and sort it out. Other than that, yeah, the lower level experience is pretty relaxed
---
Along with what everyone else said, dishonourable kills apply to everyone nearby in the same group of the player that got the DHK.
---
It's only 1 from wf totem but it an extra attack with like a few hundred ap in addition to the str totem
---
Seems like there's a drinking problem among the boars.
---
GPU cache gotta be something different though? I think shaders should be precompiled in the game data already, so not exactly sure what would go in the cache.
---
Well from what I remember the Alliance tactic is everyone stay in base and every so often one guy comes out for  a suicide flag run mission and the Horde all leave the base to kill everything so the one lone Alliance player has an actual chance to do that. Then the Horde tries to kill the Alliance Druid midfield when the Zerg has the flag and usually both sides get lost in bloodlust and both flags are returned.
---
I love this game
---
It's up to you how do you do it. The drastic imbalance was created by (slightly) minor faction mass transfer to their safe havens, making those who stayed a (completely) minor faction. Everyone saw that coming tbh.
---
the problem is to rip meters you need a short killtime and that depends on your guild a lot
---
I'd say the very lowest pop servers currently are similar to a Vanilla server from back in the day. I play on Dreadmist which is like bottom 30% in terms of active players, and it still peaks above 5k players which is way more than a Vanilla server.
---
Victor Nefarius' Lair.
---
Stay out of Goldshire wearing that things could get strange.
---
Oh man, that's worse than dying.
---
Yay more griefing tools!
---
And even if it was slow, it was hitting after 3-6 seconds without the effect reaching you.
---
Understand your saying %hit is not a problem but whats your +hit and spec?
---
Your issue seems to be raw hit rating and weapon skill diff based on SS miss rate. 
---
Also not sure what your uptime on SnD is compared to your other rogues. Would need a link to your logs to give you a better answer.
---
Feral ass
---
These salty alliance lol, the video is funny, relax, you wont die IRL if you laugh a little
---
of course you "should" be able to do it without it, but this guy posted that his guild is having problems 20 manning Ony. GFP will help greatly if they are having wipe issues. Once they get their tactics sorted, then they can reduce the need for additional buffs.
---
What was it about?
---
Fuck you.
---
Just report him and get him banned from Reddit

WoW actually keeps my body from breaking. I’m a active MMA-fighter and since the release of classic I skipped more sparring sessions then I did in the past 5 years.
---
Just a quickie in the gym and get some reps in then home to wow! Feels so much better then getting punched in the face every other evening.
---
I’ll have to return to the face punching sooner or later, but for now I’m enjoying not being in constant pain all the time.
---
I recently hit 40 on my hunter, and I was using the 15.89 dps and speed 2.8, [Crystalspine Stinger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13037/crystalpine-stinger) , until I hit 40, then I tried to switch to  [Crusader Bow of the Eagle](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15287/crusader-bow) with spd 2.2 and 20.91 dps, but my overall DPS on my paper doll has dropped significantly. Both have Deadly Scope attached.
---
Why is this? My skill is the same in both (at first I thought this was it), but my dps drops from like 173 to 153. Could it be the paper doll factors in crit damage which would theoretically be higher on a slower weapon?
---
This and you are beautiful. Stick it to them barbarians
---
Raptor*
---
Thanks for the info on wsg greaves! didnt know about them  
---
Do you know how long it would take to get exalted to get them?
---
A list of their "victims" and "targets" with some nothing personnel kid level "rp" text thrown there. Dont have a link sadly.
---
Uhh I guess but I didn't read the post as their people keep dying. Just that help is needed for tanking guide and how the aggro works.
---
Spec holy/prot to get Sanc and solo run DM:E for lashers.

Raw gold from greens and trash is ~40g/hr on a bad run.

how much hit do you have?

gO tO rEtAiL durrrrrrrr

This is very original
---
Doing a quest is griefing? I think you have quite an odd definition for that. 
---
On a side note, I spent 4 corpse runs getting out of Everlook and to the Horde flight master last night due to a 15-20 player Ally raid just killing and camping the whole city of Everlook. Surely, that's just healthy world pvp, not griefing. Still got some quests I have not managed to complete in there, wonder which one to try next..
---
Tanaris, Searing Gorge (lmao good luck tho), Silithus are my usual haunts for thorium. Can mine rich nodes now tho, so also making a stop in Blackrock Steppes
---
#nochanges
---
also if you think this us griefing, dont camp neutral cities you twonker
---
Except then they would need to ban everyone attempting to finish the quest.
---
The amount of salt you continue to mine makes me jealous.
---
Try silithis,that's where I had to get to 275.
---
&gt; Classic servers are 3 to 4 times bigger than the biggest Vanilla servers.
---
Do you have a source on this?
---
Game is cancer for Alliance at phase 2, Phase 2.5 (with bg's) will suck for horde. Since you will basicly have a que to get into a WSG or AV. 
---
You also have to que up from a city. and you get back on the place you were. so if u que up and go to a place to wpvp than u have to fly back to get into a que again. City's will be overflow with people wanting to do bg's. 
---
Blizzard #nochange is a big failure and here I think its why:
---
1.Servers are capped at 15k instead of 3 from Original Vanilla. (so 5x more people) (change 1)
---
2.Blizzard is making changes, due to speed up some releases (Dire maul) (now Battle-Grounds) (devilsaur respawn rates)  (change 2)
---
3.Because of still changing the game, u have to keep changing it and keep it go faster than it would actually be. because of to much complaints  (change 3)
---
4.Everything is min-maxed (we knew this from before) but I heard people would play boomkins/shockadins ( try weird stuff out) but once  you go into a raid and every item is bis listed, I dont see any guilds using a right DKP systems, and everyone and everything is so serious about Classic, I think people forget to make fun . Mages/warirors/rogues are like 80% of the playerbase, stuff is inbalanced, and every1 who said it was oke and will play classic because of their nostalgia is overruled now. It isn't how it was back in those days. (and thats fine) but it won't be the same, and people have to accept it. 
---
5. Blizzard should change things, ( I like the way Oldschool runescape is handling things with those polls online what u want, and what u not what in the game). With changing classic, those old privateserver people will again complain ( but with a playerbase of 10 million people (retail and Classic) you won't get any situation where nobody is complaining. I think they should overthink what they want for the future, you cant keep WoW classic forever with only the things they have in the game now untill phase 6. you have to make more content, or slowly going to release a tbc or even wrath server.
---
Oy, fuck off and clutch your pearls elsewhere
---
Sadly Gandling is pretty fucked, no matter where you are, no matter if it's 1-6 AM, there's always ganking going on. Yesterday we ran Maraudon, even in freaking Desolace of all places the instance entrance was ganked by 60s. (we did get in eventually xD).
---
This hurts for alliance. On horde-side, the fishingrod reward in hinterlands bumps you to 425, giving you 100% catch.
---
Go the fuck away
---
It used to be a thing some years back. I do not know if they have it these days though.
---
&gt;most servers
---
lmfao
---
They can craft a pet version. It doesn't fight.
---
Ghost wolf and a dead Ally body... Man, you bought it to the next level... I wish I could do an undead druid to call him zoonecrophiliac.
---
It's not a bug
---
The increased atk speed also makes aimed shot faster.
---
He is not just finishing a quest. He openly admits to doing it on purpose to give DKs to the oposite faction. Also it should be fixed so the quest mob is no longer a civilian.
---
You'd be crying for sure if your faction was 40% or below on your realm.
---
Only if I had Quel’serrar, or have gotten forors, neither of those belong to me..😂
---
The healing on that sword is insane even without healing gear. I was dueling a warrior yesterday who had this sword and couldn't believe how much health he was getting back. Warriors are normally a free win for priest cos they hit shield and don't get enough rage to do anything but he was outhealing my damage and I ended up going OOM before I could kill him. Don't think I've lost a duel to a warrior since Classic before that.
---
You are very much on point....
---
We discovered this when our melee group got launched from a druid trying to rez a healer on our first or second pull. People were warned!  Kittens didnt listen 🤣
---
what research would that be, finding any sort of theorycrafting for anything for wow classic is a pain in the ass
---
i play on Golemagg eu. doesnt really change the fact tho, each day this sub is full of fucking horde gank squads, but even on 70/30 ratio that could mean 3000-4000 alliance players. and one ganksquad can be from 5-10 people. that means even on full Horde realms could be up to hundreds of alli gank squads
---
&gt;level 3
---
How do you know that. No data suggest any servers having that high populations
---
lmao get fukt
---
And multishot
---
S/O to bigglesworth alliance picking their spots too. 
---
Sure they are often dominated in WSP/EPL/BRM but those bastards own Feralas and Felwood often.
---
As horde I 3-8 death GY run to Dire Maul almost daily
---
That is it sir you leave me no choice, I am going to have to report you.
---
I now regret turning that quest in....
---
you all right, grandma?
---
I thought "let me ruin it for you" was going to be a hard truth that demotivated me to play... I didnt think it was going to be a method to literally ruin the game LOL.
---
Here's a new word for children: this guy is a fucking urophiliac!
---
Reading the post: Yes. During quest.
---
If you can’t handle a PvP server then reroll. Sick of seeing people complain about shit like this.
---
Our main job in the classic 3x Mage, Warlock &amp; Priest group is pulling with Eye of Kilrogg. Priest shields the Eye so it can take a couple of hits. Be behind a corner, to LoS the casters. Have Healthstone &amp; VW ready to be sacrificed, since after the Eye dies mobs aggro on you and usually you'll take some hits while the mages wait for the mobs to clump up. Mages then rotate novas and use the other 9237429 AoE CC spells the have, while you generally wait a little for them to establish aggro (around the 2nd nova should be OK) and then hellfire away. Don't wait for a full cast, try to stay in front of the mobs (they're slowed), away from melee range but in Hellfire range. Hellfire does sick damage and you will eventually over aggro the mage's Blizzards.
---
howling
---
How do you know this. My server is high all the time and spikes around 3500
---
ok, now i understand what you mean,
---
yes, this would mean a completly wrong number too
---
sorry if you missjuded you
---
Seeing people outside of /r/soccer is weird especially when they terrible at trolling
---
Really? I remember in Wrath building a yeti to try and take on Stitches without dying. I may be misremembering though.
---
So I see we found the winner of phase 2
---
[NSFW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Qmctlj2Vk)
---
This..is..gold!
---
My problem with my current server isn't that it's impossible to go out and zerg the horde back. It's that all the other kind of open world content is suffocated by horde zergs and groups. Obviously there's easily found good pvp in macrozergs out there, but there's nothing else to do and it burns me and my guildies out.
---
I just got a massive boner reading this.  I don't even need to do it, just imagining it happening is good enough.
---
Thanks for the reply, Valdihr. But now I'm disappointed there isn't a quest where a demon-possessed little girl sends the adventurer around killing random things so she can put their disgusting parts into food :-D
---
what
---
Lmao, could it be the one listed on wowhead? Maybe it has evolved since, cuz they still do have "pvp-master-race" as a category for their pvp channels
---
I have this issue at times. Dump any quests to pick up new ones to do with your current crew.
---
Like someone else already said, going back and picking up a quest later is doable. 😁
---
I'm the same, but having someone to do quests with speeds it up immensely. You might share the co for the kill, but there's a nice group bonus and your kill speed should go up, so it's always better.
---
They look weird tbh
---
10/10
---
I had this feint notion that Enh shamans are problematic on this fight, but could not for the life of me remember why and thought that I probably just misremembered. Well, we found out the hard way, didn't we... Healing the melee crowd has not been that exciting in a long while.
---
League of Legends is calling your name I think you should return
---
Yes, obviously that means all horde are bad because there are more of them. Basic logic.
---
Have a 19 twink gnome warrior, am out in the world killing horde (and being killed by them)
---
Why? Same reason I do it on my 60, to get pvp rank, plus it can be fun.  When WSG is released I'll be spending all my time in there. 
---
Fair play to the 60 warrior who spends all day defending horde in stonetalon mountains killing us twinks, Sunday it ended up with a couple of us getting our mains, he got support and we had some 3v3 60 action for a while, caused a stalemate, we could kill them, but they would kill our twinks if we logged back over. 
---
Having 5 twinks (2\* war 2\* rogue and a priest healer) ambushing ?? level horde on mounts is an adrenaline rush, never know if its a 40 who will die in 5secs, a 50 who may get some of us down before dying or a well geared 60 who nukes us. Killing a 60 lock (that fight was by the gy so we had quick res) was fun. 
---
I've given nasty shocks to level 25 rogues ganking low levels in redridge and wetlands, escaped with 5% health a (probably 60 warrior) who 1 shot my rogue friend before his iron bomb missed as I sprinted off into southshore while he was hamstrung (speed pots).  When running through 20-30 zones I am normally the target of an attempted gank, I just can fight back......
---
i know now what you mean, but what timeframe is used to create the data?
---
most likly it is "players online per houre" or even a few hours, and that means it would display WAY to many people,
---
3-4k looks way more plausible
---
95% of my guild have unsubbed. We were having fun until phase 2.
---
The addiction is dead.
---
OMFG THAT'S GENIUS! Gonna pick up one the first time I get home.
---
It's a display bug.
---
Ok boomer
---
Cause crusader procs more on MH
---
What's the purpose of any troll account
---
Why are you so upset? This only affects noobs who raid camp certain cities and quest hubs and don't pay attention to who they are killing.
---
I guess that's fine to see it that way but it would be stupid to think Blizzard will see it that way
---
On demand, only in town where other civilians are.
---
My goodness how did we not think of that?
---
All hair u/Antiheroqq, now we can live our lives in peace!
---
Positive karma just comes naturally from discussion. The people that farm it can and do sell the accounts to marketing firms.
---
That's the one!
---
Damn that sounds brutally evil....but hey if they are town camping slightly deserved.
---
I feel like the side that got hurt the most is the PVE side of the game. Trying to level, especially past 45+, has become a nightmare and practically undoable unless you run dungeons, depending on the time on your server. 
---
It has really made me and a few guildies want to not level our guys close to 60 anymore unless we can manage to find a dungeon group.
---
On the PVP side, it's been great. While the pain of corpse running through zones to try and do quests has been infuriating, being on the giving end of the hurt can also be a lot of fun. 
---
It really comes down to if you're trying to PVE, these last few weeks have been a nightmare. If you're trying to PVP and aren't on a completely unbalanced server, it's been a lot of fun.
---
\#noChanges crowd got into blizzard's head.
---
Yeah hoe much fun I have with my only options to play the game in any meaningful way being to run MC once a week and to run DME runs for gold.
---
Usually I get killed a few times by alliance on the way who actually get to play the game. If Draenei were out I could've just started as an alliance shaman instead. Would've been more fun.
---
Highly doubt it or he wouldve included em in the post
---
Here's an easier one. Run strat undead and loot some Eye of Arachnida. The eye it summons is considered civilian, have fun with DHKs anywhere you want, including battlegrounds.
---
Yeah, today was fucking wild. Alliance were going pretty insane in Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Feralas, Blackrock Mountain, and finally Kazzak. Seriously had thought an alliance only server transfer was opened for the server or something with how many were actually on this Monday.
---
No~~~ I just got my first lv 60 in WoW classic or entire franchise tbh!!! The journey was fun and awesome but I did piss off my family members when I visited them cuz I couldn't stay away from it😅.
---
yeah, 9 out of 10 alliance mages cant/wont/dont do that.  
---
They are amazed cone of cold isnt working and hen they brain fart, untill they are dead...
---
See y'all in a week, I'm going somewhere
---
&gt;Presto!
---
Unrelated to the topic but I'm curious, what's the meaning of that word in this context? I'm italian and I know the word but I'm curious to know why you are using it here, because it doesn't make sense to me.
---
Thank god. All my HKs came from yesterday this week since I wasted all my time studying instead of killing ally.
---
Whether it is a deceisive victory or not is determined by stuff like that.
---
Daaamn thats busted!!
---
That's what's so dumb about this subreddit. Every big brain 'solution' to all the 'problems' is something like 'force horde to...' and then queue forever/reroll/xfer off etc etc. 
---
It's not horde players, nor Blizzard's, fault than 55-70% of wow classic players wanted to play the red faction. There's nothing that can be done about the fact, and forcing people to reroll is not an appropriate answer lol...
---
It was hotfixed long ago. By patch 1.12 it was no longer possible.
---
Region, Server, Faction, Realm type....  
---
without that info, nobody can realy post a decent reply to your topic.
---
&gt; Sounds like the magi and hunters are shiiiet then. Warlocks shouldn't be topping meters in the current tier, regardless of fight.
---
Neither should hunters.
---
Its not against the rules. He is fighting the enemy faction by preventing them from getting their pvp gear. They are idiots for attacking civilians. I hope that each and every single dominated server (both horde and alliance) abuse the absolute fuck out of this yeti so that players thats been camping the minority, making them miserable, will have their work ruined. This is not anything less than justice.
---
A troll never "wins" anything, if you think he "baited" or "got" anyone you're just as fucking sad as he is.
---
you first
---
If I do this will I get reported? I've tried questing in Winterspring and it's unforgiving hell.
---
It was fun in TBC because you could fly the fuck outta there. 
---
No luxury like that in Classic.
---
Guess I'll ask this here as my post was auto-removed...
---
What's the best EU PVE server to roll on?
---
I'm starting with a friend in the next few days. Still undecided whether we go Horde or Alliance. Any suggestions for realms for each?
---
Friend is thinking Pyrewood Village but no idea what the pop split is like for this or other servers.
---
Back during original vanilla we were on a decent PVP server but seems from reading here it's different beast altogether these days and not sure I have the patience for it (we are both nearly 40 now and have limited play time).
---
I understand that Barman Shanker is strong but what confuses me is why its ranked so high on the PVP table as surely the bleed effect makes it significantly less useful as a PVP dagger.
---
Anyone know the reasoning for it being rated so highly in PVP by SP?
---
That's a 3 use raid consumable, save it for the peak of your raid progression.
---
Shoutout to RPers &lt;3
---
For Alliance its Paly/Druid for Flag  
---
For Horde its Druid for Flag, and a healthy mix of everything.  
---
Few Warriors, Few Rogues, Few Range DPS/Casters and healers
---
holy shit i'm out... it just occurred to me how lame it is to be even vaguely associated with this community
---
"you are the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with"
---
Better bring them precasting mages and locks who will pull aggro before tanks have reached the target, right?
---
There are bad players and bad luck. Its not class related.
---
Rules = common sense according to this guy 
---
Go take that logic to twitch, see how it works out for you
---
It was pretty good while leveling my Pally when I needed an extra hand with a couple quests.
---
Found one of OPs victims, lawl he is so mad.
---
Thanks, english is not my first language so I'm always looking for ways to improve!
---
Wouldn't you abandon the quest if the enemy faction kept killing the robot? 😂
---
People are moving from imbalanced servers, so there's a "dead servers" and "blooming servers" now.  
---
You could do quick check - create level 1 char on server, run to capital city and scan AH. On low population server there will be 8-12k items. On high it could be 20k-30k+.  
---
This will give you rough estimation of server activity.
---
Hi, /u/DDeathstalker
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e5g71f/to_all_the_rogues_out_there/). 
---
You, sir, are the true pvper.
---
As an Alliance rogue on Mograine-EU, it's been okay as I have still been able to do things. But I have noticed that less people are now running dungeons and such as its impossible to get anywhere.
---
Hopefully it changes with BGs as I would like to start doing dungeon runs again.
---
I mean most classes can't deal with more than two enemies at once , and if there red? Don't even try
---
Is there any use possible of the firestone additional fire damage on your melee attacks?
---
We've had 4 so far :| 2 on the same night (splitrun)
---
At least the Horde on Herod realize that the Alliance are more organized than them
---
I think Venture was the 2nd guild that moved yes, Big dig is still left
---
Well most of my friends quit. We are on heavily horde dominated realm Nog-EU. I quit too, waiting for the BG's and hoping something might change for the better.
---
Currently its unplayable. I still have couple of days of subscription left so i enter to check - it might even be worse than the first couple of days since the Alliance is even lower in numbers now. At first we were still trying, now it's pointless.
---
Welcome to my kill on sight list.
---
Sincerely, Snömagiker.
---
Both of them is part of the game. People that has been camping places, then calling it part of the game in the name of "#nochanges"! now is your time to step up. 
---
No changes boys!
---
Does the playability on the new server make it worth it?  ( which server did you move to )
---
I have a filter that removes the pvp complaining posts based on keyword criteria, but yeah, this place is toxic as fuck if you're caught enjoying pvp and having a blast.
---
I've seen people on here seriously call others "sociopaths" because they engage in pvp as it was designed in the game! 
---
Like these people are so unhinged and angry at a video game that they have delusions of grandeur that the players who are killing them on the other end are real life threats to society. 
---
Another post tonight straight up said, "What we're doing in wpvp is immoral" - like whaaat? It's a video game. 
---
Half the time I get a kick out of these posts, and I'll read them off to my girlfriend similar to how you'd read a "Floridaman" story, but unfortunately I also know that when I come here there probably isn't going to be much legitimate discussion.
---
Just hearing about the effort makes me want to reroll alliance, I just don’t have the time to restart. I’ll see you from the other side and give you a wave I guess!
---
No I think he might just Issues.
---
Look at his profile bio.
---
Someone should make youtube highlight video using this stat
---
No point in talking to you if you don't realize this person is abuding an error in game design to grief people. I just hope people from his server report him.
---
Yeah pretty much xD
---
I'm happy leveling my alt right now so I'm good too. I also don't understand why People complain rather than just do something else. It is not like we have a huge world to explore on a lot of classes...
---
People just loooove complaining nowadays xD I guess the Internet (and retail) contributed to making everyone entitled to have the exact gaming experience they would like..
---
This dumb thing you refer to is called marketing.
---
It's a science that try to get the most money out of a product or a features.
---
As for P2, I don't mind at all. Biggest thing it did was probably expedite no-pvp players out of PvP servers.
---
Wish they dealt better with faction imbalance but shrug, it is what it is. It was like that back then, was just less known since world wasn't as connected as today.
---
Willingly not using a Thunderfury on your maintank when you have the option to is basically unheard of. If you look at any of the private server record speedruns, if the MT in that raid had a TF he would use it. Theoretically, if you can hold threat without using a TF you can increase your raid dps since it frees up 2 more debuff slots for something like corruption, but in practice this hasn't really been done.
---
Nice. Yesterday at DM i danced with a tauren for a couple minutes, we were best buds until i /moo .. he didnt like it and went berserk mode haha
---
I respect that you are doubling down on your stupid idea.
---
There will always be a half second where you knock your bow and shoot regardless of attack speed. This is not calculated in the bows dps however. Meaning the slower your bow, the less that half second is going to impact your dps.
---
This is awesome, thanks.
---
PvP to PvE was actually kosher, they didn’t allow PvE to PvP.
---
You use it during a boss fight, it attacks the only present enemy and it does next to no damage, but more than zero.
---
Green mobs are your friends!
---
Lvl a warrior in OG vanilla and again for classic. 
---
The pain only gets worse if you try to hang with at level or over mobs. 
---
Stick to green, get tactics mastery as fast as you can so you can charge/MS or BT and nuke that mob dead and pool some rage for the next one. 
---
Learn to stance dance if your sticking to arms (assume arms due to use of 2H)
---
If you want a more engaging game play, go duel wield fury. At 44 you should be able to get the 1h from SM quest and 1H for OH from RFK quest Bring the Light. 
---
This will carry you to Mara 1H (Thrash Blade) for MH and one of the other swords as your OH till you hot 60. 
---
2H maybe cool looking and may kill stuff faster but to me its a snooze fest and I prefer a more “active feel” to cutting stuff up!
---
I yell "you no love server" and "you'll be alone" don't think it phases em.
---
lol he thinks this is real
---
Just watch some of the bigger streamers disgustingly fly from one end of the map straight to the other using rocket boots + parachute, or watch them wall-jump literally everywhere on the map to places you're not supposed to get to either become untargettable by most enemies while holding on to the flag or to just take quick shortcuts for turn-ins instead of taking the ramps or tunnels. The meta and best strat will be exploiting the shit out of everything possible until (if) those things get fixed or banned, there's not too much of actual pvp strategy or team-comp left.
---
Hinterlands has mithril and small thorium. Don’t forget to check uo nother where the green dragon spawns. Careful of the elite mobs they’re practically bosses
---
hope that thing dies in the boss fight then. i have used this in brd and it will just charge the next mob and the next until it dies
---
Why do all PvP servers have to be like that server now though?
---
You might be right. P1 &amp; 3 are you cautiously dpsing or just white damage? I guess the latter is safer as long as the healers don’t oom.
---
Don't remember their level, but the birds in Deadwind Pass is a solid 20-25g/h if you keep up with their spawns. A rarely visited area and very few "know" about this farm.
---
any way to make a mouseover macro work on humanoids only(players).
---
Wish they expedited non-RPers out of RP realms too   =/
---
Good point.  
---
Although I don't think we are overly concerned about that as we likely won't even get to contested zones by the 10th but just don't know if we both have the passion for a PVP server.  
---
Back in 2004/5 I was all about it, but now...not so much.
---
There is no exploit. 
---
Some programmer in blizzard once sat down and made it so that quests you abandon can be taken again. 
---
Either this or another programmer in blizzard also sat down and once programmed this specific npc to make this yeti hostile towards the enemy faction of the guy turning in the quest.
---
Either one of the two previous or a third programmer in blizzard also sat down and once coded this specific yeti to grant the joy of DHK if the enemy faction decide to kill this target.
---
All of these were done intentionally.
---
I think people will eventually look back on it fondly and miss the open world fighting
---
Moving large amounts of PvP grinders out of the open world won't solve the problem of large amount of PvP grinders in the open world?  
---
Umm... ok
---
Stickied topic for replies only on this particular topic.
---
The  paradox of tanking. Insanely in demand for dungeons where they make up 20% of spots. Not at all in demand for most raids where they make up 5-7.5% of spots.
---
It will calm down once battlegrounds appear.
---
WSG legs are phase 6 I believe
---
&gt;"For the ~~Horde~~ Money!"
---
I feel like there's ample evidence to the contrary here that you're overlooking.
---
Then have fun being farmed for honor I guess or go back to retail.
---
You have no honor, Horde. Wish everyone Horde was like Saurfang xD
---
Ok, mate. Stick with your delusion servers are roughly the same as vanilla then.
---
&gt;TL;DR: What we're doing regarding wPvP is inmoral, and we have what we deserve. 
---
Not even sure what that's supposed to even mean, but it's just a video game.
---
You don't play Call of Duty and sit there and go, "Guys, please, stop shooting me. There's no compassion in that."
---
WoW pvp has been unforgiving since its inception. That's the whole point. All the shit going on now is the shit we did 14 years ago.
---
All the complaining we see now is the same exact as we saw 14 years ago. We even called it before classic was released, "The forums are about to explode in rage, watch!"
---
Because all of this happened before. And people asked for the same exact game, and got it. So yes, it's what they deserve, because they chose to play on a pvp realm, they wanted classic, they got it. 
---
It's a classic example of "You made your bed, now sleep in it."
---
Damn, I thought you would have come up with something better. I'm disappointed. I guess I'm even more right than I thought about you.
---
By the way, stop complaining about "complaining". It makes you a hypocrite.
---
Saved, this needs to be common knowledge, fight the gankers!
---
anyone find a list of things to ruin.
---
Oh, Kevinb70, what a different world it was.
---
Except they're not though. Idk what people you have been playing with but you can look up some premades from pservers on YouTube and you will find out.
---
Battle group is normally of the same flavor 
---
PvP with PvP/RPPvP with RPPvP and so on. 
---
What will most likely happen is horde will have a super long Q and alliance will insta Q just based on raw faction numbers.
---
Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne
---
Me neither, too many Scandinavians I think.
---
Wtf are you pve pleb complaining about
---
Poor baby has now to open their eyes while farming at the fly.
---
Get fucked loser haha
---
Mind sharing why you used to do that? I'd like to start doing it too.
---
About 10. Atleast 1 per boss and maybe 2 for raggy.
---
So it should not be allowed to purposely stand next to civilians in camps/cities with intention of making some idiot accidentally get a DHK? Itd psrt of the game.
---
Eh madness in phase 2 is to be expected and the best thing you can do for yourself is accept as much. It is already dying down steadily and will continue to, tho there will always be some.
---
On pvp servers, ally will not be able to do a single thing in Silithus when the war effort starts.  Horde will own all 3 camps 24/7.  Why I quit the game.
---
Amy magic also doesn't increase plus healing that you do, only increases how much heals heal for on you.
---
Yep reamed out a couple guildies who got ganked while leveling in Stv and parked their mains near by.  Found them ganking low levels.  If you're ganking low level people you're ruining the game for these people.  Theyll quit, and wont come back.  People leaving will hurt the game.  Stop being dicks.
---
Allyance is the majority of the realm, so our PVPers are having the time of theyr life farming BRD/MC.. Most allys don't like to pvp so we just farm them.
---
Obs: By we, i mean Horde, i don't pvp either, just walk pass them.
---
You still haven't told me why you refuse to fix the issue.
---
I guess you just hate fun. You hate other people having fun, so you need to make sure no one else has fun.
---
Never thought of it like that before, cool! Though the tanks in instances can be more than warrior, they're still the most used class in the slot.
---
Even better: you have honorless target after logging in too. You could place lvl 1 "landmine" character all over the world to log in at big fights and dish out DHKs.
---
Recent peaks were around 4.2-.4.3k concurrent online. That's still more than it was in vanilla but not much.
---
There was an item restore self serve option in the account page. 
---
It has a 1Month CD for restoring items.  My friend used it when his ex-Gfriend deleted his bow 🤣
---
Back before the launch of Wrath, I opened a portal to stormwind for my guild after our RP event, turns out the zombies were invading and they just so happened to be in the mage tower where portals take you. May as well have dropped the guild into a blender. Our computers were so shit that everyone had clicked the portal before the first guy finished loading and could earn us not to come.
---
Vanilla was a lot harder than classic because the content was harder on release, gear and talents were worse, etc. Plus you actually had to spend hours learning fights before you figured them out, and the best builds and items weren't as known back then either.  So it's understandable why people who played back then have those memories of the game being a lot harder back then, because it was!
---
Discord chats don't disappeared though, I would've liked for him to at least get one insult over discord
---
Do you think PVP server can really be a thing without casual? 
---
Iam genuinely asking because I think we need casual for the long term healt of the game.
---
HAHA you're really comparing LHC to all of Searing Gorge + Burning Steppes + Gadget + Marshal's + Everlook + every other contested zone?  
---
BUT BUT BUT Alliance ganked me at LHC GUYS!  Damn you had an extra death.  Go play alliance over virtually every PvP server right now now and see how much sympathy you still have for the horde's plight at LHC.
---
Isn't this whole post about how he can handle the ganking just fine?
---
Works if ques aren't 55 minutes. We shall see
---
It's the same attitude why there are bullies at the school yard.   
---
Some people just need to be mean to people, for no particular reason.
---
you said it your self nothing but complaints since the game started.
---
Serves them right.  Funny how some people can dish it out (see all the "git gud" comments about people not liking the fact they can't play) but when it happens to them it's raging.
---
Why are you dodging such a simple question? Is it so inconvenient for you to face the truth?
---
&gt; Spell power on gear was basically non existent on release.
---
Spellpower literally didn't exist. You could only get +spell for a specific school (fire, arcane, ice, holy, shadow, etc). Some mage tier 1 items had +fire dmg. Itemization was completely whack. Spellhit didn't exist either.
---
Yeah so sad you actually have to corpserun \_once\_ before getting in to instance. I feel you man - sounds horrible!  
---
/s  
---
Problem isn't getting killed once or twice while someone is holding dungeon entrance, the problem is we have to run 20 times if we want to get into a dungeon. If someone is just holding dungeon/raid door, you just run back and spawn right next to the door and enter the dungeon/raid. That's nothing.
---
They probs killed each other way over 4 times and are worth no honor, Stop overreacting.
---
100 speed is running, 160 is 60% mount
---
108 is pretty normal
---
well played dude
---
This already made my day, and I just woke up
---
You'll be banned with a warning, and if you are dumb enough to be banned again by doing it again, it's gonna be 1 month at least. 
---
You come back a third time and do it, 6 months,
---
And after 6 months you log on, jump onto the roof and kill people, that's a perma!
---
cause it procs more often on MH despite OH being faster and it procs faster when you open on someone. crusader on OH alone usually procs well into a fight which means pretty much never vs cloth/leather which are the people you wanna be opening on most of the time anyway.
---
That's what it sounds like, as they are saying it snapshots your +healing.
---
That enchant is phase 3
---
Yeah, that does make sense though - this is kind of a blanket post to everybody who has responded rather than responding individually. Thanks for the replies. I wasn't really thinking in terms of officers and high ranks are tanks. I just come from tanking in other MMOs and tanking in other expansions here but I just haven't had the chance in classic other than dungeons. 
---
I guess I'll wait it out and see what happens if I stay committed. I am already raiding on my mage for a few months with one guild and so far nothing has changed and they've told me to basically find another guild if I want to tank.
---
good riddance
---
Dudes rank 13! ;)
---
I expect peak selling times will be the end of March, followed by a massive price crash, and then good selling prices from June/July onwards.
---
^^^ For PvP this is the way to go. Please OP listen to this comment.
---
Not likely.  The phasing in each zone probably doesn't allow this to happen anymore.
---
But imagine that no dmg x40. It would be glorious
---
Yup 😢
---
It would have to be in there inventory to not proc a drop.
---
Did My Benediction quest yesterday, when I arrived I saw a horde player doing it. Instead of interrupting him I stood a bit away and cheered him, even though I didn't knew if I had to wait 2h to do it. As he completed the quest and he got his staff we both danced and I started my quest. He also cheered me while doing it and rode away. Completed the quest as well, im so happy
---
pretending that people who gank inside cities and on flightpoints are not griefers, good joke
---
I hear ya, but I don't agree. When the follow up sentence is what it is, it should be clear what the critique was from the start.
---
I see, thanks! Seems to be the same when having crippling on MH - it pretty much proccs like 90% on the opener
---
Genious. When blizz does nothing about it, the players get smart.
---
Inb4 some bullshit like "we changed the mechanical yeti which chases people for the quest, to be friendly to both factions."
---
I have a 40 hunter on a pve server but I can’t do my jump shots anymore. I’ve become a clicker because of the arthritis and it’s embarrassing to play her now. It’s also boring. I’m bummed the game has become such a drag. Maybe I’ll just make a rogue on a pve server and explore all the zones and sneak into places. That’s kind of dangerous.
---
According to wowhead, 5 second cast time. It is also channeled since you control it, and you can move it across the entire zone.
---
Ahah yeah that's true, like I said, pull it out during progression. If you accidentally pull a mob with it after you FINALLY kill a boss, the raid will probably laugh it off.
---
But most likely it will die by then.
---
We use detect on them then MC into our pack to then kill them here, we're fully aware about it
---
Yeah, no. While you’re right on the money for how it works, your idea of how severe it was is completely wrong. The only people that cared about DHK’s were people trying to rank. It only severely affected rank 13 going to 14 since any small detriment could ruin your chance.
---
It also only affected that one week or if you just don’t bother with rank it didn’t matter at all(rank 0 spends half of Vanilla camping and griefing and making life a living hell and stacking thousands of lifetime DHK can stop, wait for the reset, and jump on the train towards rank 14).
---
DHK didn’t cause much of anything except that rank progressing PvP players didn’t join city raids until they hit the rank they wanted(if they weren’t pushing for 14). There was some same-faction griefing with DHK’s at first until the system became more learned and then it was just who gives a shit about DHK’s.
---
Rank 13 Warrior, Rank 10 Rogue from Vanilla. The Rogue had over 5000 DHKs before I started PvP ranking on him. Warrior hit 13 and I no longer cared and DHKs didn’t matter at all.
---
I don't have one, it is a community issue, blame every single one of the people saying "Alliance bad, Horde good" over the history of World of Warcraft. There is nothing Blizzard can do besides forced transfers, locked character creation on specific factions, changing Classic to offer incentives to the minority faction, etc. If they're doing to adhere to "noChanges" they'd kind of stuck.
---
Druid is objectively the best flag carrier, but just throwing a druid at the flag and expecting it to be a guaranteed cap isn't gonna work. A lot of druids are just going to be getting locked down in WSG as every team communicates "Kill the flag carrier!"
---
A lot of flag caps are opportunistic in nature, meaning any class can successfully do it. However, of course your classes with movement boosting abilities are going to be the strongest.
---
Shh. Don’t tell people about the cave.
---
You can't have elf warlock..
---
I have solo’d Mara extensively and have it down to a science. There are many TINY thing that make the run efficient. I kill all 3 bosses and loot all herbs in about 12.5 mins and it would be less if my gear was better. There are also tiny tricks to GAIN soul shards while in there. PM me if you have questions.
---
We need wowbash back.
---
You fucked up by not trying to get into a fresh guild while leveling or start your own guild.  No good guild is gonna trust a decent tank who shows up 6months into classic release because that kind of tank player is not serious enough.  You gear up an offtank that you know will be loyal to the guild until naxx.   Thats just how classic works.  Youre only hope now is to start a guild with other scrubs who dont have a solid guild yet or go fury until end of bwl and show your dedication.  Good luck
---
wahhhh
---
wahhhhhh
---
Yeah undead race is treated like the warlock class, basically everyone dislikes you. But you dislike the alliance more than the horde, for now, so we on the same team.
---
Gadgetzan feels more like alliance territory to me. (Flamelash-EU) every time I get there to learn some engineering stuff  I get killed several times.
---
It’s basically when something is extremely easy/fast and done in a whiff. 
---
I found a definition on Cambridge:
---
”Said when something appears or happens so quickly or easily that it seems to be magic”
---
Out of reach of guards.
---
It's basically what was mentioned in the patch notes on Nov 12.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23164374/hotfixes-november-22-2019
---
&gt; Developers’ note: We’re seeing some players attack others by abusing line-of-sight rules in Gadgetzan. This disruption is against our Terms of Service (as it was in 2006) and we’re taking action against players who exploit this game mechanic.
---
Nah star is used on your best player on pvp roam group
---
Fight where the other rogue isn't? Why such a dumb question? 
---
The 2 rogues can either stunlock and murder as a duo or support their other team mates by attacking backline while the other one defends? Why such an "innocent" question to such an obvious answer?
---
It only matters in objective based pvp where the total amount of players don't change. A class would have to be very OP to make up for a base lack of players
---
I disagree, the factions seem to be fairly well balanced and there are no more queues. I consider myself very lucky to have chosen Firemaw.
---
There's lots of underlying psychological reasons why some one would bully another person thought.
---
If your lvl47+ you can also use a LAP to remove the snare.

---
You getting zerged alone has nothing to do with numbers. You should understand that without my help.
---
It really depends on the server, on Netherwind Alliance seem to roll Horde. I die about 3-4 times trying to take a zeppelin from Org.  Let alone trying to get into BRD. I'm sure on some servers its Horde doing the same thing. 
---
I dont get the enjoyment for them, I like pvp when it's a fight, but I guess if you're just farming honor roaming gangs murdering lower levels is better.
---
Also looking at lifetime kills, Warlock seems to have had a lot more kills week 1, and was therefore higher rank in the first week than Rogue. 
---
Week 2 - Rogue gets a lot more honour and catches up. 
---
Week 3 - Rogue will surge way ahead of warlock. 
---
That said, it may be a bit off since rogue is getting a lot more honour/kill (smaller engagements) than the warlock is, so who can tell for sure.
---
I don't care about my internet points, but I would like to understand what makes people downvote the other comment O.o Are they salty that their guilds suck and can't even beat MC? Just told a joke and stated a fact and that is downvote worthy why? I feel really dumb right now.
---
I don't see any intellectual dishonesty in recognizing that an addon which pulls data that is available to the player, whether they consume it or not, is not immoral. It is no more immoral than using an enemy cast bar addon.
---
the problem arises when the warrior has a healer in his pocket, in which case you'll only win in some really edge cases, or when the warrior or healer makes a huge mistake. If it's a pala healer, just lube up and bend over
---
&gt;This is a very vocal minority that must represent (a very sad) 0.1% of the playerbase.
---
keep telling yourself that...lol   Surely, that's why the alliance have all quit playing on pvp servers.  Cuz everything is fine...  what a fucking joke.
---
Never go full prot
---
It's the same problem honestly. Faction inbalance is not fun to either one. I just feel the need to point some servers have the very same problem in opposite terms, even if those are a minority.
---
Yeah I’d like screenshots as well because I highly doubt this caused people to quit, lol
---
It's being used in the same way as "voila!" Basically to reveal something and say, "this is it, now look!"
---
I believe magicians used to say it at the end of a trick? I can't remember how it came to be used in the US but I believe that was it.
---
Used this also, had fun
---
Classic wow is not the "real thing", the real thing was 15 years ago and was intended for \~1/10th the playerbase per server to what they're now, and players took much longer getting through all the content without every single fight, spec and exploit fully worked out.
---
There were massive pvp zergs in hillsbrad and sometimes brm, constant ganks and corpsecamps everywhere and even people just ganking grey low levels just "for the fun" when pvp ranks rolled out in vanilla and before bgs were introduced. But there werent systematic 24/7 unemployed deathsquads trying to squeeze every last point of honor through whatever method possible out of everyone whos just trying to land at any fp.
---
Where is that screaming woman from? I'm assuming a reality show.
---
Damn, was hoping I could just instantly summon this whenever I get jumped. With a 5 second cast it's a more meticulous process.
---
Of course down voting, to measure our dicks, happens.   
---
If you would read my reply, how can it be seen if the max it ever shows on /who is 50 people. So how does he know there is only 150 people online?
---
Less risk to just log out inside and let the lead run out reset and jump back in.
---
sphh, try being a hunter....
---
Imagine posting this.
---
So, no one is going to talk about him equipping a rifle to a libram slot as a paladin?
---
Layering was a mistake because it was abused.  I dont agree that layering made alliance pussies, i think it just ruined the economy to a point of no return
---
It’s always funny when people who come home from work, then sit in front of their television from 6 to 1130 PM watching vacuous bullshit call out anyone doing doing something different that *they* enjoy, because the TV people don’t understand it.
---
Source?
---
What that fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
Yes, and its enough for everyone:D
---
I mean, it's a bit vague. You really think Blizzard had classic - BfA all figured out 15 years ago? Or you think they just tacked more onto the abomination that is retail every 1.5 years making it up as they go along?
---
As I firmly believe in "option 2" and this offhand NPC comment hasn't convinced me otherwise 👀
---
Yes, make all bop items and switch is very common.
---
Content was a face roll on buffed pservers.. the average guild will not need consumes for bwl as stuff is going to die so quickly.
---
why won't someone think of the gankers!
---
Does wow differentiate number pad vs the number row? That would definitely be pretty handy if so, never thought to test it out.
---
This. I was one of the first decent prot on my server, but still new to the class, even if I played and sometimes tanked in WoW that I play since release, Vanilla Warrior and its commitments are a whole different animal.
---
I got my guild while it was one of the first running raids, met them while I was getting some preraid bis in 5's. Clinched on Discord, did like 3 raids and even if they wanted me to MT, still didn't trust me enough to give me gear. So i joined them and now I'm the oldest tank in the room (seen 3 lose their motivation/temper/or just give up meanwhile). 
---
Now I'm in a very good position, getting bindings and tanking along an officer since they saw that besides me everyone leaves when they're geared. 
---
It's tricky but worth it, I'd say start as a dps and on stuff like Domo or Sulf, help tanking to show that you have tanking gear and skill, you'll be asked when the next MT leaves if you're felt like a stable person. 
---
MT have this tendency to leave guilds cause they get geared very fast and most people won't help for nothing (sad but true in 2k19), plus we're still early in the game so people are getting bored before they think they would if you already have rag/ony on farm since weeks. 
---
Think about Thunderfury, Facing Nefarian in the eyes, engaging C'thun or leading some Naxx 40 to stay motivated and try to get a Rag 2-Hander to go cut heads while you don't tank. Rerolling is also good to calm a tank but since it requires so many refines, you might not have enough time.
---
Yeah this is not okay for BGs.
---
All horde ARE bad, though.
---
Imagine being *this* easy to rustle.
---
Just get the rank 10 set or higher if you can pvp that much. The pvp sets are very overtuned for the current phase. 
---
Later on you're really going to fall off without raid gear or rank 13 gear thou.
---
You'll be fine right now but eventually unless you want to do 'some' raiding you will find yourself falling behind quite a bit.
---
Not to say anyone is right or wrong here, but I would be very careful abusing this method, it cuts really close to what it is accepted or not and Blizzard is known to have "mood" changes about what is too much.
---
This, I rolled on a PvP server because my friends wanted to. Now they all stopped playing (because getting farmed in Menetil is no fun) and now I'm stuck on an imbalanced server.
---
I rerolled on PvE now, it sucks to start all over again but at least I'm seeing things in colour.
---
&gt; an addon which pulls data that is available to the player,
---
Here is the dishonesty. Because while it is *technically* true, that the data is there, it is not possible to process it and also play the game at the same time. That data is only available to you if you keep checking the combat log 24/7 and forget about every other aspects of the game. 
---
Noticing that another player started casting is vastly easier, but I also agree with you on the fact that certain apsects of it can be immoral. If an addon tells you what spell the enemy started casting thats where I would draw the line. There are many spells with the same casting animations and effects and being able to tell them apart because of an addon is bad. So we dont disagree on that either. I feel like its not just Spy thats immoral, but I Spy is still at the top.
---
He’s clearly one of those that OP was talking about lol
---
lol no it's not THAT bad. The DHKs only start to really hurt after rank 10.
---
im so gona fap to those screenshots
---
Fucking hero. Yes.
---
Okay there slugger. Me calling out your complete lack of empathy isn't me playing a victim. You are a shutter xD
---
In days of old, they were all smashed into one haply little family. Total shit show.....
---
When are we getting the darkmoon faire?!?!
---
🤣
---
Well the day the honor system came out DHKs didn't matter anyway since nobody had a rank yet.
---
It was funny how people went crazy the first week because nobody actually understands how the honor system works.
---
People that complain that the server is suffering and blame the people leaving the they are wrong! They should only blame blizzard.
---
Nobody is saying to the victims be patient and keep logging, at least nobody sane. They are asking for blizzard to do something else the game is dead. You can't stop not farming people with groups. What else can you do to progress your honor bar? **Either way someone has to give up playing the game.** Being chivalrous and not "be part of the problem" will only end up with you never attaining the progress you want while the opposite faction will be progressing like mad. Say all the people get to play fairly. We got 70 horde and 30 alliance. they fight 30v30. The other 40 horde that are "not playing into this bullshit and whant to earn honorably the honor" will just wont participate in the game. **Someone always looses in any scenario**. So what's the difference if someone keeps farming minority people and forces them to leave VS not farming them but you leave because you cant progress the game? If people leaving that **ONLY** show that blizzard has failed. Yes, there will always be griefers and there always has been but its not the majority of those who you think are trying to make it unplayable for the minority. All they can do is go with it until blizz listens up and fix this shit or kill the game. It just means it just failed. Not the players fault. 
---
I will copy-pasta something that i found in forums so you can see that the problem you are referring to is unavoidable with such numbers. It's not the people who are binge farming the minority people's fault, it's the fact of overpopulation and imbalance where the majority is "forced" to gank repeatedly for any progression and the minority to mathematically not have a chance to fight back.
---
&gt;*"It is actually Blizzard’s fault, and anyone who thinks otherwise is dumb as a rock.*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*WPvP in Vanilla : 2k players per server, 80% of the game was free for leveling, farming, etc.*  
---
&gt;*WPvP in Classic : 10-12k players per server, virtually ALL areas camped by gankers, every single lvl 50+ dungeon entrance and the path to them camped.*  
---
&gt;*I am sorry, but WHO decided that 90% of the people will quit the game, so we will have layers in P1, and when P2 hits, we will have 1 layer of 3k people?*  
---
&gt;*It was Blizzard.*  
---
&gt;*The reality was that far less people quit, and most servers, when layering was removed, had 3-4 or more layers worth of players.*  
---
&gt;*It is 100% exclusively Blizzard’s fault, for not understanding that Classic will be huge, and people won’t quit in droves.*  
---
&gt;*They started with 33 servers worldwide, and now we have 4 times more. They were off 400% in their “estimation”.*  
---
&gt;*They started with 7-8 layers, assuming a 90% drop-off.*  
---
&gt;*The drop-off was less than 30% before layering was removed.They were off by 200%.*  
---
&gt;*I am sorry, but this is a composite 800% error in their “estimations”, and we can clearly see the outcome.*  
---
&gt;*In Vanilla, a 60-40 faction ratio was basically a BALANCED ratio, because out of 2k people, 1.2k would be one faction, and 800 another. The dominant faction would had 400 more people. Spread them over 50 zones, and the advantage is insignificant, 8 players advantage per zone.*  
---
&gt;*In Classic, a 60-40 faction ratio, when you deal with 10k people (which most servers have), means 6k to 4k players, an advantage of 2k players.And you have 40 extra player advantage per zone.*  
---
&gt;*I think you get the point by now WHY this is entirely Blizzard’s fault."*
---
If you're alliance your best bet is not leaving dungeons until you're 60. If you're horde, any spec will be good because it doesn't matter anyway.
---
On a serious note, I reckon Soul Link is your best bet. Increased survivability and double void sac. Then work your way up to Nightfall.
---
That's a different point, but it's also the game design that everyone playing classic wanted. If you don't like it, ESC -&gt; logout -&gt; boot retail
---
You clearly haven't played any online games that allow this much player interaction.
---
yeah, double crippling is just the best when you re pvping generally. mind numbing and wound OH for bgs gonna be better but when you re just looking to pick off ppl 1v1 i just go double crippling
---
Maybe, just maybe Ehm... Find fucking better hunter man!
---
Guess everyone who was rambling at people qqing over all the comical chain camping of certain areas forgot what they were mad about yesterday lol
---
Not everything is Blizzard fault, but little things like guards imbalance can get really annoying.
---
Yeah what do you mean about putting resources into my mage that I have no chance? Can you elaborate? Genuinely interested to hear your opinion on it.
---
Oh I see. So shall I delete my comment before people downvote me for thinking I'm an idiot or just leave it for giggles?
---
An eye for an eye...something something MURDER
---
It's not like the players made the system, blizzard did
---
I plan to dive into PvP as soon as it releases :) be more mad. Your problems are not my problems. Go back to private servers toxic trash. Bye bye!
---
I fell for the troll bait! There's no way he is serious.
---
The misspelled slur is just *chef's kiss*
---
Mother of God
---
P3 with BWL
---
Warlock spells are okay, just watch out for white names.
---
He did say after 5 DKs
---
I still don't get why Spy is being used and has ever been used. You should be killing the opposing faction on sight, always. No need to get the info from an addon.
---
Make a sticky post for Phase 2 complaints or something
---
You can continue to use almost any BoE Engineering items after switching spec, assuming you have the minimum Engineering skill for the item. This is why the most tryhard will start Gnomish, craft the BoE trinkets, then drop and switch to Goblin to craft expendables like explosives. Note there are a couple exceptions... the Gadgetzan transporter and Everlook dimensional-ripper require active specialization to use.
---
My empathy is reserved for people that deserve it.   Not for idiots being called out for their stupidity on the internet.
---
We *should* have that (auto removing non-flaired posts) already in-place. Lemme look into it.
---
Tanking in bad guilds sucks. I’d play fury until I was in a good guild (&lt;60min MC), then be the fury dps who is willing to tank on sulf or domo, and eventually might get a spot as fury prot. 
---
Ranking to 12+ is also a good way to show commitment as a tank.
---
We all have problems down here
---
3k hp with stamina buff. You do the math.
---
Population is mostly fine, but wpvp and fraction inbalance still induce people to quit or switch servers.
---
Back in August we started a guild mainly filled with RL friends. We were like 20-25 ppl. After one month 90% of them dropped and I am now left with my brother and one additional friend. 
---
We swapped guild like 2 weeks ago, because i still wanted to be in my friends guild even tho nobody was online. In retrospect i would say we should have swapped waaaaay earlier, because this game is so much more fun when you have people to interact with. Eventhough its just the guild chat or discord.
---
Are all alliance snowflakes or what?
---
You still pvp on normal servers lmao, the only difference is that you can opt out, pvp servers just dont get that choice. Pvp is still an integral part of normal servers.
---
.. that? that was not chill. What kinda raids are you in where this chaotic mess sounds chill?
---
Damn and I have finished that quest already
---
I didn't realize twinking was a thing yet.  I'm gonna farm myself some deviate scales.

Or... people here didnt have the opportunity to be mean in school but now hold the sword of 1000 truths!
---
I would stock up on the turn in items. 
---
There are profession specific quests but they were to help the folks with that profession out. You still have reputable were stuff like fluffy tails, harpy feathers and scorp blood.
---
Stock up on these while they are low in cost.
---
Mages are the strongest.
---
Thanks, so far from experience roots always break prematurely due to damage, so maybe run rank 1 if I'm actively fighting the person, max rank if I'm trying to run away so they get snagged for as long as possible.
---
In this case, it's entirely class related.
---
Get into a large guild with multiple raid groups, eventually a new raid grp will form and your DPS role in raid group C can be replaced sooner than a MT for group D.
---
I'm sure there are less people now than there were at launch, but the layers were removed on a schedule. Big servers have queues to log in. What you're doing is proposing that server populations no longer mean what Blizzard claims.
---
this is brilliant.
---
Thats great, thanks.
---
Good thing I actually picked gnomish first.
---
BWL was not faceroll
---
Those people who said PVP was the only way to experience classic WOW.
---
What a bunch of idiots lol.
---
The same people leading the charge of No changes are now relentlessly bitching about it.
---
I'm from Netherwind too. Yeah we have alliance 45:55 horde. Maybe even 40:60. But it's actually not that bad.
---
Well you selected a quote right around where I acknowledged that it may not be consumed by the player. I am completely aware of that fact and do not find it immoral, so it is not intellectual dishonesty. Where we really disagree is on what makes something moral or not. To me, calling something like an add-on that parses data for you immoral is pretty far out there, and while you are being intellectually consistent in acknowledging that add-ons such as enemy cast bars do exactly the same thing, I have not seen a soul raise that one up as a problematic add-on.
---
Bless you child.
---
its impossible to corpse camp a paladin, bubble hs is at most 5 minutes away.
---
If an item itself says "requires gnomish engineering", you won't be able to use it. The only such items are two Transporters (goblin goes to Everlook, gnomish goes to Gadgetzan), and World Enlarger.
---
Main items you need to craft before switching is Death Ray and Battle Chicken.
---
Well yeah that is true.
---
I never really understood the Server sizes.
---
Is it average concurrent online Players or is it active Players in a week or what exactly is it? :O 
---
I know what you just wrote is concurrent but if we look back at classic Server sizes - what measure are they using? Do you know by any Chance?
---
Being from Stalagg I dream of 38:62. You guys are closer to 50:50 than you are to us.
---
Undead start with lower reps for a reason!
---
Already got 3 people in winterspring. Ty, fam
---
I mean im not saying its nessecary to do MC, but if he wants to win the dmg meters in MC as a feral cat druid that is what needs to be done.
---
Yea i was pretty mad for the first few minutes and then i released its nothing to worry about. 
---
Shame the 60 didn't stick around for the boost due to rage.
---
No as it is the area rather than the eggs that spawn.
---
Because it's futile with people like you, how can you continuously be too dense to understand this.
---
Have a good day mate, you've proven all my points so there is no point continuing.
---
I’m sorry, and I’m not on an unbalanced server so I don’t have this unreasonable hate for the other video game team, though I do enjoy the world PvP battles.
---
If this becomes a thing it will ruin any and all world PvP. And I see a bunch of you are super excited to do that, ruin part of the game.
---
I’m not ranking or anything, and don’t really care if I get a dk, but I think this is some short sighted shit that’ll get patched if abused like some of you say you’re about to abuse it.
---
Kinda racist name
---
I'm a lock so I always say just kill them. I've seen too many wipes from getting them as adds, and they are easy if you banish the big ones and kill the small ones first
---
It's BOE, you can buy it/have someone else craft it for you. Those two are just the items you *have* to craft or else you're not getting them without re-doing the whole thing two more times.
---
Sure.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/censusplusclassic
---
This needs to be fixed right now. People will see this, and go and troll people who have been spending the last 3-4 weeks none stop farming removing a ton of their hard work. Sure it's a laugh but it's beyond cruel.
---
See this and raise you: killing an honorless target should bestow a debuff called, e.g. "Dishonorable", causing the target to grant double honor for the duration.
---
No idea. Other comments suggest greaves might be phase 6, though.
---
Mate... You lose honor when you kill them. That means they award negative honor. The lowest amount of honor a player can have is 0.
---
Found the private server player.
---
I guess it's 5 days now. But I level really slow till 35 and messed really much up.
---
The ban times i made up, but im certain a 3rd ban will net you a perma ban, especially if its for the same reason each time.
---
Well, after this post, the likelihood is much increased. :)
---
The local defense spam feature of this addon is bannable. I mean so it his PM but more people might not know they can get a temporary chat ban for using the feature.
---
Is that an excuse not to [carry your weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUc70zMFAKI)? Let's say the guild's progress hits a brick wall. Assuming the guild doesn't break apart, who is the one to be replaced? The slacker or the feral druid who competes with the other melees and sometimes high-rolls his way to the top of the damage meters?
---
Everyone from Venture is more or less a KoS, except a single night elf hunter. He was a chill dude
---
I. Love you
---
When you at low hp fightng 2 mobs.
---
I had a guy rage at me when after 3v1ing me while I leveled my alt twice, I pulled out my 60 and wiped them out.  Apparently when he gets honor from it it's "ganking" and when I log over it's "camping lowbies".
---
\- No profession
---
\- Hunter/dwarf
---
\-PVE
---
\- No instances, just the quest guide.  
---
Thank you! :)
---
Ruin phase 2? You just saved it for me. Grobb zerg guilds, enjoy your L :)
---
Most people rejected his message.
---
They hated SouthernOpinion because he told them the truth.
---
Even the intro speaks about it being an alliance of convenience rather then out of love
---
I doubt people came back to classic for its mindblowing PVE content. Once they saw that the tales of amazing WPVP and community were bullshit they probably lost all interest going forward. Can't imagine how shit the Ahn'Qiraj event will be
---
I don't know why people like you comment. You obviously have no clue what the hell you're talking about.
---
On horde side, typically, swords are prio to rogues. Combat swords on horde side is exceptionally potent with windfurry. Warriors get prio on deathbringer and 2 handers.
---
While the BRD quests dong give great rewards, I found them to give really good exp. 
---
Did my first BRD with all the quests I could get at 53 +1 bar of exp. (no rested) was not able to kill emp due to lvl but I hit 54 just as we killed the last trash pack. 
---
After turn in of all the quests I had i was 1 bar from 54. 
---
Total run took 2hrs 23min with a group of 53/54’s. 
---
We all walked out with +1 lvl from doing the mobs and almost got our next full lvl from the quests.
---
You're crying so hard
---

It's called safespotting and it's an abuse of game mechanics. Blizzard bans it because it's an unfair advantage and they feel it's a detriment to their game.
---
Yep 30 days is usually enough to break a habit (though 60 days is the clincher) and Wow is definitely maintained with an addiction loop.
---
with Rhok you do a clipped rotation, so mash that aimed button
---
Actually 44 is correct

No, that is not dishonest all. I use that same reasoning in justifying that enemy cast bar add-ons are fine. There is no intellectual dishonesty, you just disagree with me.
---
Agony and Doom are definitely counted as dots. And Winter's Chill as well though this seems like a bug (Shadow Weaving and Improved Shadow Bolt correctly have higher priority than dots).

Pretty much, this subreddit is infested with 'em

i tanked her for like 20 seconds as a rogue

Fuck it, every post is now a pinned daily discussion post. Quarantine everyone into echo chambers where they can bitch about whatever they like, or share horde-bashing memes, or ask simple questions and get snarky replies. Effectively disable link karma and the ability for any posts to make the frontpage (let alone /r/all).
---
There's not a perfect solution, because you can't administer away people's toxic bullshit. I'm glad the mods are making an effort though, and appreciate the difficulty in doing so... it's almost as hard as balancing nine different classes across two factions in a way that nobody feels slighted.
---
And yes, I understand the irony in making a post complaining about other people complaining.
---
doesn't seem to do anything
---
we reported the same 3 safespotter every day for weeks now and they still do it every day
---
Absolutely, the screenshot was posted on discord a couple days ago and since it's from a horde warrior it must've been made even earlier (discord is alliance only), so I assume it's been reported to blizzard plenty of times already. But we know nothing will be done if it doesn't go public...
---
Haha yeah both factions are inherently different and don't have shitty people on both sides that do asshole things haha haha
---
No mate, you don't lose honor.  You lose *rank*.  A DHK instantly lowers your rating points, it has zero impact on your honor.  That's why your rank drops instantly the moment you recieve the DHK, instead of waiting for the weekly reset when all the honor-related stuff gets calculated. Nothing in the game can cause you to lose honor.
---
Every dueling tournament ever: All welcome, except warlocks.
---
Alright
---
So the writing is shit when it doesn't suit your made up logic. Got it.
---
Mad Lad you should of shared your wisdom earlier.
---
That's interesting - I'm in a similar situation now, I've moved to team B who are clearing rag/ony. Only thing is I'm like 4th as tank, so I've just moved to DPS for now..
---
Any mount you can buy with exalted rep with that city 🧐
---
The main Forsaken plotline in vanilla was building their own version of the UD Plague to use on everyone. This comes to fruition in WOTLK when they bomb the Wrathgate and kill Bolvar. Which Sylvanas somehow gets away with scot free even though she definitely knew what was going on. Also we basically make and deliver this plague and we're let off the hook because reasons.
---
44 is about half way Experience and time wise most People say.
---
I found it to be sort of true. I think I had 18 hours less from 44-60 but that might just be because I powered through it a bit more.
---
Shaman way better carrier.
---
Yeah that post from your link above is the reason why I opened this thread.
---
Since we have some kind of progression with the faces, nobody seems to know if darkmoon faire will be pre or post 1.09. I was hoping to find an answer with this thread.
---
Yeah that's my only problem with bad guilds or new players. I off tanked recently in a pug and so much went wrong from the DPS part, not listening, etc... I'm not really down with that. I guess I'll just DPS right now. Annoyingly, I have all my items as prebis tank stuff...
---
Hold up buddy with those broad generalisations. I'm on the alliance side and my goal is also to ruin any horde player's day. It's unfair if you say that it's only the horde doing this.
---
Oh so *thats* what the helipad out by Hydraxis is there is for.
---
Where do I enter this script?
---
Reddit needs a "closed as duplicate" function like StackExchange that points people to the original thread.
---
Que av. Wsg turtles suck
---
Yetis in the world is alright. 
---
That eye in BGs however is a whole different ball game.
---
BGs are supposed to be a place of no DHKs and since you’re always in a group you have no choice but to get a DHK when one of your team mates kills the eye should some idiot spawn it.
---
That dude is pretty good.  Assuming a dreamstate/resto build, makes good use of the total druid kit.  Kinda surprised how often the mages wasted time and Mana sheeping/novaing.
---
Horde lvl 52 here, yesterday i was trying to enter BRD for arenas on Morgraine. Had to corpse run about 6-7 times because alliance kept going further back starting from the lower chain all the way until the entrances. Ended up taking 35 min to get inside.
---
Even by unshamefully waiting for another horde lvl60 to respawn first so he can aggro them, afterwhich I charged a mob in the opposite direction, I was still found because they were using the spy addon.
---
I’m just starting questing in ungoro, guess what imma do? Thanks
---
Ok sorry I've been playing for a long time but wtf is a dishonorable kill?
---
Our druid healer switched to bear and tanked him for literally 1 minute in a split yesterday
---
I know it probably wouldn't work for technical reasons, but it would be cool to split the forsaken off as their own faction in a later expansion for lore reasons.
---
Death threats? The toxic pieces of shit deserved it then.
---
&gt; Classic wow is not the "real thing", the real thing was 15 years ago and was intended for ~1/10th the playerbase per server to what they're now, and players took much longer getting through all the content without every single fight, spec and exploit fully worked out.
---
Exactly I've been saying this exact same thing for over a year. Its cool to see people agree. Back in the day when i played Vanilla it was considered a challenge to down rag as a guild. Progress was server specific and there wasn't all this cross faction chat so you actually had small accomplishments like boss kills as a big deal on server.
---
&gt;There were massive pvp zergs in hillsbrad and sometimes brm, constant ganks and corpsecamps everywhere and even people just ganking grey low levels just "for the fun" when pvp ranks rolled out in vanilla and before bgs were introduced.
---
It was actually fun and to gank and kill people long after battlegrounds were out. We ran through STV as a group of friends at max and just terrorized it sometimes. 
---
&gt;But there werent systematic 24/7 unemployed deathsquads trying to squeeze every last point of honor through whatever method possible out of everyone whos just trying to land at any fp.
---
Sure the whole game wasn't fleshed out so things like soloing tribute runs wasn't really a thing either. Back then you had thotbot to try to figure out quests and what not, now its questie or full video guides. The game hasn't changed much but the players have. The nice thing about classic is that its warts and all. Blizzard left things like world PVP in because its not their job to decide what should be left in or out of classic. If we wanted classic to be "balanced" or "fixed" we'd play retail. The goal isn't to keep all the players playing as long as they can. The goal is to have as authentic of a vanilla experience as possible.
---
Ah, I see. Yeah that might be good to know, I have no idea either.
---
Vinland Saga got an anime? Oh man, I might have some catching up to do.
---
Ret isn’t super bad for burst damage. Looks like the guy had Earthshaker. However, the priest looks terribad.
---
Got it, thanks a lot!
---
This man speaks the truth and he gets donwranked, what a community .....
---
Delete your character. Remake a new character with same name. Restore deleted character. You will be told the name already exists and you must rename it. 
---
I'm unsure if there is a period of time before you can remake a new with the same name. I suggest testing this on level 1 throwaway characters before committing on your main.
---
S isn't bound, i think he uses ASD to walk
---
&gt;Suppose its because its god actual working guards
---
Yup, same reason why I only take the Booty Bay-Ratchet boat. At least I have guards to protect me. And 90% of the time the boat is filled with Allys. 
---
Most hordes are in Menetil anyway.
---
Couldn't you right click them?
---
Good morning. How are we today?
---
I see you didn't Play private Servers.
---
Private Servers just had a lot less cry babies that Q.Q all the time pretty much.
---
They had a lot of flaws but nobody gave a shit because it was free.
---
Now that People pay they (probably a fair assumption) are entitled to have a perfect game catered to their demands.
---
Which simply will not happen with Blizzard no matter how much you pay they will always try to give back as Little as possible so they can earn more...
---
It's a legitimate way of self-defense. Wasting my own time corpse running by being ganked constantly is not scummy?!
---
Removal of weather
---
I usually just hit up burning steppes and go round the east of the ogre mound. Whelps for days and you resist most of their fireballs.
---
Right now everyone's thinking burning steppes you fucking madman but it's a rarely travelled area, if you aren't on a massively skewed server I'd say you'll be fine. Only time I've been killed is when I strayed too close to our fp once and got found by an incoming gank squad.
---
Ugh, sounds pretty tough. And here I thought Faerlina had semi-decent player ratio (55:45 - 60:40 depending on which source you're quoting - but hey, that's probably bad enough). I don't know, I would personally have opted for something streamer-less, I'm sure many roll Horde just to stick it to certain infuriating streamers, or some streamer in particular. 
---
If you want to reroll and join here on the EU side, I'm sure our Alliance would be happy to have you. Seems to be very close to 50:50, with a slight bias towards Alliance after the last free migration.
---
Hunter is probably the fastest leveling class, especially if you're going beast mastery.  Low downtime, not as gear dependant and able to solo elites and higher level quests.  You're in good shape I think.
---
That guard spam is real for them mana users.
---
Nononono. DHK's affect RANK points, not Honor points. If you are the TOP honor farmer on your faction, you get 13000 rank points per week, with a fairly sharp falloff that then plateaus out. 
---
ONE DHK can be a full day or two's worth of honor farming at the top end.
---
Holy shit!
---
You STILL don't get it. You're obsessed with this "fixing issue" nonsense and are blind to any understanding or nuance of what I'm actually saying.
---
Fucking hell, you're one of a kind mate, phahaha!
---
I'm waiting until BGs are released you little dummy.
---
Thanks for the laugh though! I applaud your stubborn obtuseness. I wish I could go through life with as much dense ignorance as you manage to.
---
;D
---
;)
---
What was their reaction :D??????
---
1500 crit is pretty low
---
You have bad hunters, if you think mages are the strongest. Warcraft logs doesn't lie - hunters parse the highest of all the ranged dps.
---
I really have to question those green bis pieces listed when 3sp is valued more than like 30-40 main stats. Never even bothered using them.
---
Oh our horde camps Morgan's vigil super bad xD 5-15 players scouting that part of the zone xD it's a battleground in our server! Which is why i use duskwood now!
---
Doubt they actually quit the game.
---
It was made in like a month, so I guess they recycled a ton of stuff to get it done fast
---
lool so no alliance ever needs to farm gold or consumables then, just play bgs all day with 0 gold
---
this is dumb as shit
---
Use it for raid with zero issues
---
Seriously I don't understand how I'm supposed to "get gud" when I'm a level 30 trying to level and 4-5 horde 60s show up and start camping me, it's annoying
---
I don't know warrior specs well enough, but can't you go a fury-heavy fury/prot spec and be ready to slap on a few defensive pieces when/if needed for tanking? I would presume that fury/prot tanks are great for Ony P3, for example. That way you might end up with a decent DPS spec, while maintaining a viable tanking spec - and of course, you could remain open to going deep Prot if/when required. 
---
Learn as much as you can about tanking the raids for now though, so that you have ample knowledge if your time comes around.
---
Imagine being so mad at your own idiocy that you quit the game
---
Your mileage may vary. I've been seeing the most hardcore roof campers suddenly roaming around in the world (in 15man raids though). Wonder what made them change their behavior. 🤔
---
Server statsostics based on Warcraft logs which are entirely unreliable and inaccurate
---
500 gold? For whelps? Damn...
---
What a mad lad
---
yes im now in a corner crying and being sad and lonely
---
I don't understand? Do the yeti kill the other faction if they attack it? If it's only lvl 1, how?
---
Could someone explain gearing on a healer/priest for me. I understand that Spirit&gt;Int&gt;Stamina. But ive also read that gear like "Increases healing and damage by x" is best for healers. Then i came acorss a "Increases healing by x" gear. Im confused. What is better and how much do one need; currently using 3 pieces. Hope i make sense...
---
&gt; You are not addressing the problem here at all
---
Very true I can't fix a problem that doesn't exist. The game isn't designed to be played in 2019 that's the great part of Classic. It's an old game brought back to life and there is a good chance there are thousands of people that don't like it for that reason. The hundreds of thousands you'll need a source on but definitely thousands won't like it. Its not designed to be liked by the most people its just the most authentic version of an old game they could make. There isn't a problem to fix its all just an experience you can play or not. 
---
&gt;Your cute little story of how you got ganked once and escaped
---
It was about me getting camped and it was just one of the many ways to avoid camps. This game has awesome features like rez ranges so you can avoid camps. I've avoided a ton of camps like this so anyone having trouble can just do the same. Its a PvP server so you'll have to know some tricks in PvP to prosper there.
---
AV turtles suck too
---
Go with honor! See out there!
---
Is there a list of debuff priorities?
---
You can farm hands of power instead of the felcloth gloves. They're only like 4(?) Sp behind. Apparently I got really lucky on the drop and they're hard to get though.
---
Worth it for the fresh 60 looking to save for more important expenses.
---
*walks by level 23 orc in ashenvale on my way to felwood* looks like your time has come honorable opponent.
---
Old school griefing is what made this game great back in the day. And combating the people who did it of course ;) havnt been playing classic but this is some awesome nostalgia thanks buddy
---
Killed him twice so far on a Horde dominated Server, but Azuregos is nearly impossible. But I got the Pants first kill so I have everything I need from World Bosses and don't have to worry about it anymore.
---
Only if you're racist enough to think anything with chucker is racist.
---
I just sat there with thorns on where the skeletons spawn (I'm a bear druid) even though i couldn't see them, my friend doing benediction said the skeletons were all attacking me.
---
Blood and fury?
---
A dishonorable kill reduces your honor by a lot. A couple of these yetis could absolutely ruin your honor rating.
---
Frustrating inconsistent writing.
---
I want wow to stick to warfare or peacefullness. This *cycle* is irritating.
---
LOL, but it doesn't need to be honorable. Slay them all! Murderrr!
---
nice lol, probably was supposed to be in gold, did the owner rage PM you?
---
Darkshore has only oily along it's coast. 
---
You can AFK fish most 20+ coast lines for them without pools.
---
from what i read in other post WSG rep grind sucks hard.  I've read that taking into account all the flag captures and win/lose tokens that you get and exchange for rep it can take anywhere from 40h up to 400h time in WSG to reach exalted. Where 40h is beeing lucky and going in with amazing premade group each time and winning in 10-15 min 3/0 and 400h when you casually pug WSG without luck with more loses than wins.  
---
So i guess ill go with Eldritch xD  
---
On the other hand AV is faster by A LOT. ( you could get it in one weekend from what i read)
---
OK this might be worth doing to dedicated PVPers. Bringing a priest, MCing, buffing with thorns, and attacking with this little shit.
---
Immune mobs dont give skill ups. 
---
You have to hit them in order to get a skill up chance. The immune counts as a miss.
---
How do you feel if given 2 rune's for a port?
---
Yeah not the first time we speak together and as last you dont even take into account what I said.
---
&gt;The total online population of a server with one layer cannot exceed the total online population of one layer
---
Yes its possible, you assume it's not which make sense but doesn't make it reality.
---
Continue living in your bubble pulling data from your ass when you don't have any clue what you are talking about.
---
Cheers mate.
---
I put max rank agony and corruption on them and walk away. If he dies. He dies.
---
Nightfin is pretty good on my server, goes 20-40s per fish depending on the day.  There are some good spots off the beaten path where noone ever checks, so even on PVP server you won't be interrupted.
---
True, if you get a DHK from this go gank someone else!
---
When you come up to content that isn't a complete faceroll, then maybe you use more than 1 per raid.
---
Beautiful
---
He apparently was PvPing the night before and it must have went out of range.
---
This was our first attempt of the day
---
Nope. I farmed 6 arcane crystals today (solo world PvP) ... and we killed kazzak ... (the alliance are outnumbered 2 to 1 on the server) ... -and- ... I found a cheap Arcanite Bar. Good freakin' day.
---
Because of underlying psychological reasons.
---
Like billbobflipflop said above, it breaks down to queue times and what ever becomes the best Honor per hour.
---
Imagine being this upset about PvP on a PvP server.
---
All right you lose rank points. No reason to be a dick about it.
---
Classic Reddit and YouTube keeps my sanity while at work. I am on this list as well.
---
Then either go play an alt or continue this until you reach the instance, at least they get nothing that way. 
---
And saying they don't care about honour is funny since this issue didn't exist until p2
---
Heirlooms would be fun, too, with like 50% haste and crit.
---
A priest gotta do what a priest gotta do.
---
That helmet makes your hair awful lol
---
It doesn't? I then remember wrong. Haven't played in a while and recalled this was the case.
---
Pretty sure you get the honourless target debuff every time you log in
---
I actually LOLed at this. That's funnier than hell.
---
As a warrior, I get a lot of satisfaction out of watching bad mages die, because even with frost reflector, insignia and a 30 min root break cooldown, they’ll still kill me without even trying.
---
No one quit the game over this, guaranteed hyperbole lol
---
Based
---
Mean it's classic, what skill is there really outside of using consumables and pressing your buttons? There's nothing to shadow word death or to react to. He played to his classes advantage what Ch is bursting. 
---
Like calling a rogue shit for starting stealth
---
Corrupt Guild Master ninja's loot
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Nope, you can check for help/harm and dead/nodead if that helps.
---
Oh, then I must remember wrong. Completely different case then :)
---
of course he doesnt, it never happened
---
I mean... you know what you sign up for. This is a 15 year old game and we all know how things go on PvP servers. Rolling on a PvP server then complaining about being killed/camped at any level is pretty idiotic. 
---
Bring the downvotes, crybabies.
---
Niiice, smoking big doinks out here in Amish.
---
Well played, nice gold winnings.
---
C'mon man I make food and ports, and there's 3 different ports. We press like 6 buttons.
---
They scaled down pretty hard and gave like +1 rating at level 1. For that resilience thing, +15 came from chest enchant and then like 9 from all heirlooms combined.
---
&gt; It's purely harming someone else for no benefit.

And the group of 60's steamrolling my level 45 in Tanaris (a mid-40's zone) or back in Dustwallow Marsh or Arathi Highlands (30's zones!) is benefiting them how? I'm not one of the complainers, I keep plodding away at quests as I can or find a dungeon to do, but stating that these PvP groups are 'just a simple toon trying to make their way in Azeroth' is overlooking a LOT.
---
Human warlock still without a 100% mount.
---
Id really like the AV Ram, but do you need exalted with IF to br able to ride it?
---
And how much gold am I Iooking at compared to the warlock mount?
---
As a bigglesworth horde player, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! Seriously, this week it feels like the alliance came back to life. I'm getting corpse camped often, and I'm happy as hell about it. There's an actual fight happening again instead of a braindead farm. I will see you on the battlefield friendo, keep up the good work.
---
It’s filled with it? Never seen one before.
---
Best bet is to get into a midtier guild.  Go fury, get gear.  Ask for offspec tanking pieces.  Tank 5mans until officers notice you.  Build a reputation that you like to tank.  If you play your cards right, you should have good tank gear by aq40.  If youre not given a tankspot by aq40, move to another guild with all ur fury gear and apply as a tank.  Aq40 is when lots of turnover happens
---
I usually pick pocket ring of law, killing pyromancer, and then i pick pocket all the way to the bar, killing the gnome. On my way out i pick pocket the ring of law again, and kill all the minor fire elementals for elemental fire and essence of fire. I always get minimum 30g/ hour. A good tip is to check out all the safespots you can run if they resist. I also sell all the healing pots on AH for about 1.40 g per stack.

---
If you read the post properly, this quest NPC can only be summoned at a few locations, all of which are in cities or quest hubs in the wild. It won't hurt wPvP, only people who camp said cities with a raid without being killed by guards in said cities. 
---
If you spent 4 corpse runs getting from one quest giver in Everlook to the Horde flightpath just a 10-15 second run outside the city walls because of a 15-20 player Alliance raid, you probably would agree that wPvP in that format is not really what wPvP should be about. As it happens, this quest partly takes place in that city.
---
The picture is for last 14 days. 4/96 is last 7 days. So no I didn't refute my own claim.
---
Thanks I will play PvP. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Yeah if you're raiding and gearing your mage, if thats your main, I'd be quite unhappy that that gear is going to waste and you swap to your warrior.
---
Or you're spending gold on your mage for crafted BiS, enchants, etc, not your warrior.
---
Tank spot is a very coveted spot, and if one comes up its going to go to the guy who has put his heart and soul into playing warrior, not someones alt after we've put loads of gear on their main.
---
Approach it from the guilds perspective if you want to be successful here. Sorry this is a bit blunt, I'm just trying to share whats probably the view of your guild leadership.
---
Damn if only I new about this. :) Was 54 when the world pvp patch hit and am 57 now. Majority of level is spent in ghost form. I have not complained as others that are 60 be like haha we got you on farm bring them salt. 
---
So I've gone about my own business and trying my best to level through the nightmare.
---
Oh.. but if I knew to not hand in the yeti quest, then I could have lol'd every 5 mins when some 60 killed me instead of patiently just adding them to my kos and moving on.
---
Only thing that will ruin my phase 2 will be them delaying the key ring to phase 6.
---
Are you salty about this little trick he posted? Aww
---
A living legend
---
Good luck with the reading comprehension.
---
&gt; most servers had 3-4 layers of players, each layer with a number higher than the highest Vanilla servers, which were at 3-3.5k.
---
Where are you getting this? The developers themselves have said the exact opposite:
---
&gt; The last time a server in this region had more than three layers was the first week of September, and almost all realms reached two layers shortly after that. This includes high population realms such as Faerlina, which has had only two layers for three weeks now.
---
Low level campers suicide rates tripled overnight.
---
I think he's a rogue
---
Zug Zug. Me click on queue. Me no click on join bgs. Me make zug zug wait...and wait....and wait..me /noskill!
---
That dude is „Javel“, a woman that also does great work on her and the classic druid discord.
---
And yes, the running gag among druids are the mages sheeping us lol
---
Then replace priest with rogue.
---
This is correct - but unfortunately it's misused all the time so it's hard to actually have it mean anything other than "got killed" these days.
---
I dunno, a dozen HKs is very hard to recover from if you are pushing the pvp ranks.
---
Hello OP,
---
[this](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Resist) and subsequent links regarding binary spell mais help.
---
(Basically some spell are binary, others not, and binary spell cannot be partially resisted. Binary spell are spells that applies a debuff like frostbolt or fear for example as it’s difficult to imagine how the partially apply the slow debuff of the slow effect or the fear)
---
idk if alliance are much more casual (whiteknights probably are, lets be real here) but [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=30&amp;realm=4706\_Flamelash](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=30&amp;realm=4706_Flamelash)
---
Doesnt seem that unbalanced according to the statistics
---
57% / 43%    Horde favored if you are too lazy to view
---
Also possible if alliance players just play alot more of alts
---
I am not an expert on this subject, never been roofganked, never roofganked myself.
---
It’s not like Honorless Target is a hidden buff no one knew about. They had to have noticed it on themselves when they land or hearth. If they were so concerned over ensuring they get their honor, catch them as they leave a town. If you’re a rogue, just hunt in towns for people that afk (or keep tabs on people present and wait a minute or two after they arrive) and nuke them. The top honor on alliance on Fairbanks is a rogue that nukes people in kargath. He dies a lot, but he gets at least 1 full honor kill every time.
---
That's very true unfortunately... Shoutout to the corporate who get millions, hope it's worth it
---
How often do you use the cats eye goggles?
---
set a kill order and have the dps follow it.  In aoe your consecrate with RF should easily out threat a blizzard.  Its when dps focus fires a target that you can lose threat on it.  Thats ok, while they focus and burn skull before it can really do anything you are ticking up a bigger and bigger threat lead on x and subsequent targets.
---
its all in your viewpoint
---
to some, its way scummier to camp flight paths and grave yards so that a person has no reasonable course of action other than logging out just so you can get that 75% deminished honour kill on a rank 0  
---
its just turning the tables really, you wanna be a shit bag to alter your honor? then why cant they be a shit bag and alter your honor too?
---
Boomkins are trash the entirety of classic. They don’t really get good until Wrath.
---
First off: warrior is a pain in the ass to level up. You have to live with that and just accept it.
---
You want to play as arms until around lvl 55-60. You can tank every dungeon in arms spec, just put on a shield.
---
For questing: if you are alone focus on doing green quests. It will save you mich trouble. Or team up with someone, preferably a class that can heal. Then you can pull more mobs at once, gain more rage and do more damage.
---
Warrior becomes fun at around lvl 36 when you have whirlwind and sweeping strikes, which lets you pull 2 mobs at once without a problem.
---
Most important advice: dont give up! Warrior sucks so hard at leveling, but in the end game we are the best dps and tanking class ;)
---
Ps: you can also tank endgame dungeons in your dps-fury spec. Even in raids, all offtanks are usually dps specced.
---
Yeah it's cause of the travel time and damage fall off
---
Your ignorance is why you can't comprehend the actual problem.  If the Horde actually put up with what the Alliance put up with, they'd probably quit the game a day after phase two came out.
---
It was always 1h atleast in classic. We farmed them in groups if anyone in the guild got his hands on a timer.
---
Now this is the content this sub needs more of!!!
---
ES-EU. I am not sure what your questions are.
---
Horde:Ally ratio is probably around 3:2. Alliance are significantly more PVP oriented (camping choke points most of the time in groups), but horde has more presence on important objectives (world bosses).
---
There is a Swedish/Finnish guild and a Slovenian guild on Horde, I think. Not sure about the rest.
---
Join the server discord - the PVP channel is pretty much a shitstorm 24/
---
7.
---
Lol, alliance are the worse gankers. Rogue corpscamp people far away from gy just for griefing. I assume you luckily he is alliance so he can atleast do a little leveling outside of a instance. As a horde it is impossible.
---
To be fair, that’s probably the only reason I would quit.
---
So what? Nobody prioritizes getting exalted with AD in their first couple weeks of being 60.
---
Sure, that makes sense.
---
Do people like multiboxers now? I remember doing a negative comment about them here a couple of weeks ago and got downvoted HARD. Are people multiboxing reddit aswell?
---
Tell your 60s to come out from iron forge
---
It is very significant - you're just getting rekt.
---
I would say one charge per boss plus two full pummelers for Rag.
---
You could subtract a charge for any bosses you expect to be tasked to Decurse on, those would be Lucifron and Shazzrah. If your guild has Rag on farm you'll probably use many fewer charges on him, but if it's half-pug there's a chance it drags.
---
So 5 pummelers per run. If you're decursing for those two bosses and you want to cut out one more charge to make it 4 pummelers I'd pick Sulfuron. That fight is primarily about interrupts and AoE.
---
I don't think we are operating under the same definition of what intellectual honesty is. You seem to think that if you find a problem with my argument that it becomes intellectually dishonest. It is only dishonest if I purposefully ignore or misuse elements of an argument to suit my purposes. I clearly am consistently fine with the use of data that is available in the combat logs, regardless of whether players can reasonably use that information without the help of an add-on. So again, no, I have not shown any intellectual dishonesty in this discussion at all.
---
Not all enemy casts can be visually distinguished, and some that are use colors to make them distinguishable which hurts color blind players.
---
I can't believe you have an opinion on spy whatsoever if you don't even play this game lol.
---
Why would you enjoy a WC run taking 8 hours? That sounds like hell
---
To be fair, this might hurt Alliance more than Horde. Allies are making larger gangs to combat lots of horde solo/small groups
---
Yo apparently i was done in one DAY, they rushed it for the gamers who farmed onyxia already.  It explains why it's just a cave with 3 different mobs haha. I hope incoming dgs are better hehe
---
I do not know where you see this information, but I am seeing 37 / 63 A:H ratio.  And this data aggregates from last 30 days so I would say that 37 is looking more like 30 in present day
---
You do understand that grieving on boats is unique to horse right? Like allies can’t do it on zeppelins?
---
What about the rest of the group
---
Or, you know, you can just not flag before leaving Org and then you have safe transit the entire way from Org to UC.  Something the Alliance cannot do to travel between continents.
---
Yeah reddit generally hates it. Mostly ones that participate in PVP.
---
Come Heartseeker, we need more Horde. Solid server that is starting to get too imbalanced.
---
Holy sweet baby Arthas.
---
You are correct P4
---
He may have used Free Action
---
It cant remove existing but will remove any new snares/nets after he uses it for 30sec.  Did you see if he had any buffs or used a pot?
---
Because camping brm and fighting 20 v 1 just isn't fun no matter how you look at it, and if you do take pleasure from that you're pathetic.
---
This pet can only be used when in range of the Quest targets (one NPC in Everlook, gadgetzan and ungoro camp)
---
2H fury is not that good for alliance, though
---
cuz demand is high and it's really only this + dm:e hydrospawn that have decent drop rate.  Yes you can get them from EPL and Felwood too but the droprate vs spawn rate of the mobs sucks.
---
what does a dishonorable kill even do ?
---
That's what heroes do !
---
OK I get that, that does make sense. Well I've crafted items, not many enchants on my "main" mage. Got most BiS and several raid pieces. But there are like 8/9 mages in my guild, some weeks I don't even get any loot and it goes to others (DKP system) - so these guys specifically, shouldn't be too concerned that I'm getting bored of that. I don't think they are. They just simply said about tank spots being filled. They haven't once mentioned anything you've touched on, but I get it.
---
However, this new guild I'm "trialing" for will allow me to DPS spec and then Off-tank when needed. I OT'd ony last night but I don't think it will transition into a tank role, yet. Hopefully it will do. I think if I tank, that would be my main, I'm enjoying it far more than a one-button-frostbolt rotation, that's for sure. I feel like I actually have a rotation, somewhat.
---
epic meme xD
---
Sorry, but 15-20 players corpse camping the other faction inside Everlook can't be described as anything else than "incredibly scummy" to begin with. Doesn't help that the guards are placed in only certain locations, and easy enough for a raid that size to kill - while turning in a quest in a city you probably should be remotely safe, but no. And oh, it takes you 3-4 corpse runs just to make it to the flight master - hopefully you are quick enough to click on a destination when you rez the next time. Efficient honor farming happens in small groups, not a half-full raid. Doing it on this scale is just... well, incredibly scummy. For the record, no downvote from me - but I think your assessment of this situation is incorrect.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Oof. This will wreck alterac valley. No way they won´t fix it.
---
that's nice then :)
---
According to the wowforum thread, it apparently works for this purpose.
---
Remoting it I cannot walk anywhere for some reason, if I hold W TeamViewer sees it as a single key press and I just take a step
---
I'll specifically buy items over other ones if they have those
---
Well done!  I honestly didn't even know druids could pvp but damn man you proved me wrong.  Well done!
---
The hero we deserve
---
No one says allaince can but themselves. You hey go off bad realm information and pvpQQers
---
yes
---
I did and I'm having fun again.
---
Abandoned my level 60 character on the worst A:H ratio server on EU, granted he wasn't geared or anything, but I have no regrets.
---
Same. I’m all over this
---
Imagining 40 people with 40 Yeti's out and the unsuspecting Horde scum aoeing inside the group is priceless.
---
Doesn't matter at all there is a wand guide on wow head follow that I think maybe one has shadow dmg
---
Bane was great. I loved going solo lone wolf with him. Really fits his lore.
---
Alliance butt hurt in pvp hasn't changed since Vanilla.  [https://i.imgur.com/41vlloc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/41vlloc.jpg)
---
When you get into raiding.
---
I've run every 5 man and UBRS with a shadow priest as a healer. If you work on getting yourself a good healing set, it doesn't seem to be an issue at all. Only big difference I notice is that shadows have to stop and drink more since they're not as efficient.
---
User name definitely checks out
---
I play on a medium population server, no queues and during the day it's great, but at night...I've seen less than 20 people in IF and less than TEN in Org.
---
If there wasn't cross realm BGs, then this truly would destroy entire servers. The majority factions abusing the minority would be left fry of targets to PvP even in BGs. But x-realm means they'll still have targets to kill for honor and they'll have free reign over resources on their 1-faction home server.
---
BGs won't fix the problem but will likely exacerbate it because the abusers won't face any tangible repercussions for their behaviour.
---
Thanks, but do you need exalted with IF to ride it if you are Human? Or is exalted with AV enough?
---
The outlands were in Warcraft III though
---
Its not like this is exclusive horde thing. I gotta admit i've done it once myself in un'goro. But then again i do try to kill everyone i see. Except shadow preists and locks with vw, in that case i run the other way.
---
Literally every video is self promotion, even the “helpful” ones. Skarm’s? Yup. Punkrat? Mhmm. Using that as an excuse to not even look at is shitty and unhelpful toward building a community that is willing to try to have open discourse and share info. How so many videos aren’t even given a chance leads to a sub filled with shitty memes and art.
---
May have, I'm unsure. I was a good bit outleveled so the interaction was quick. Didn't think to check combat log until way later
---
Before starting a pull, mark the targets in the order they should be killed, prioritizing casters or mobs with nasty abilities. Make sure you're always buffed with Righteous Fury, and have retribution aura on if mobs are mostly melee. Apply Blessing of Salvation on all DPS and at the caster if needed. Open the fight with a Judgement of Righteousness on the first target to set a threat spike, then keep hitting it with Seal of Righteousness. Cast a Consecration between the first hits to set some threat, but you should not cast it on cooldown unless you got heavy AoE DPS in your party. You may downrank Consecration for the remainder of the fight. Avoid using Judgement of Righteousness during the battle; instead, use it when you lose aggro as a pseudo-taunt. For bosses, you should be spamming Judgement of Righteousness to ensure they keep targetting you, unless they got a threat-resetting mechanic. In this case, keep it for using right after the boss clears your threat. You can use Hammer of Justice to stop a mob that skips your aggro, or Blessing of Protection to remove a DPS from the threat table completely. If you use it on a melee DPS, remember to cast another blessing on them to remove Blessing of Protection or they won't be able to attack until it wears off.
---
That bubble, that goddamn bubble.
---
Nah, I just raid log and we roll out in a full raid wiping you pricks for a while before and after our MC and Ony clears for some completely unfair 40vLess PvP action because that’s how *I like to PvP* - why would I take any real risks, amirite Mr Hunchback??
---
Yes, my server (Benediction) seems Alliance dominated with roaming death squads. However, the general consensus is the server pop is a 45/55 split favoring Horde. It has to be a best guess; how would we know outside Blizz. However, IF it IS true then server population must also be the issue meaning the Alliance folks on our server have the same issues. So my guess is neither faction is happy with phase two. Any Alliance on Benediction care to weigh in?
---
Reminds me of [Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law) in a way.
---
Translated as "One person was mildly upset and nothing else happened".
---
It's not an anachronism as the Alliance expedition has already gone through the dark portal to Outlands at this point.
---
While probably not common knowledge, Outlands is something that most mages and Alliance military members would likely at least heard of through rumor
---
Sociopath, genius, potato potato
---
Do they not get resurrected after the boat zones? If they then die again, can they not release and spirit rez in the new zone?
---
Yeah true. But if all melee use mongoose plus fire resist it makes many fights much easier and slightly faster. More time to divvy that loot up lol
---
In general I think you are right, but there will naturally be some times when certain items jump in value.
---
I think OP is right that when BWL hits there will be a spike on lotuses, and probably all of the high level herbs.
---
Common misconception, it was against the rules in Vanilla, rules were changed sometime, and they certainly don't have the financial incentive that they see to police and enforce the old rules any more.
---
I approve of any in-game method used to exploit player behavior, regardless of faction.
---
Well done.
---
Likewise. I have actual footage of this happening.
---
Can confirm as a lazy horde member this is true. We dominated DM last night though
---
Ah ok, minor run speed to boots is also 8%. I see you have spurs on now
---
I'm not sure :( I'm just in the guild, that's not me streaming
---
There is a large demand for dps warriors that can tank when needed, I would gown this route. Have some tank gear ready to go on demand but mainly dps. You will have more fun in the long run in my opinion but that’s me! Good luck dude, don’t give up on the grind :)
---
I mean, he's not wrong though.
---
A season of downhill skiing probably costs about that much per month.
---
God forbid you ever buy a boat, or motorcycle, or any other hobby vehicle.
---
Or play a game like Warhammer or Magic: The Gathering on a regular basis.
---
Spending a few hundred bucks a month on a hobby is pretty common among middle class people.
---
Sorry, too busy also ignoring calls for help from TP, Burning Steppes, LHC, Chillwind and IF gates/mage quarter/military wing.
---
I have no idea really what's happening on the other continent as it's been about 2 weeks since I've been able to take the boats.
---
run up and doen the coast south of ratchet. a bunch of them spawn there.
---
As someone who has never experienced the honor grind from vanilla/classic (was only level 52 when TBC dropped), how does a DHK count against you? Does it negate honor gain for a set time or is it like negative 100 HKs?
---
report back in a couple of weeks and tell us how that went.  
---
want to hear about your long term achievements. a single day/win is meaningless.
---
100 Rank points, it hurts the more you go up the rankings, since you need more to rank
---
is this a thing in versions past vanilla? ive never seen or gotten a "DK" as its called
---
Should blame your guild for that then, giving TF to a Rogue is just daft.
---
I too started out on a fairly high pop realm, but when 1-2 hours ques started hitting (early on) realized I don't have time to sit in a que for 1-2 hours when I actually just have 45 minutes or 1½ hour to play at that given time, so I rerolled to a "dead" server which currently is medium/high and I'm finding groups within 5\~ minutes most of the times as healer. I think people on high/full realms have a skewed picture of how many people there are even on medium pop realms, but hey, perhaps you are right with your view on server life span, who knows? Only time will tell. 
---
We also have one annoying "streamer" on my realm, but he's fairly unknown I'm sure - and deserves no mention here or anywhere as that might boost his viewership - but that's pretty much it. I got to tell you, I've seen about one and a half clip of some Asmongold stream and just based on how obnoxious he seems to be, I can understand why Horde puts in an effort to squash him and his faction. Being on the same faction and realm is unfortunate, and I feel sorry for you on that account - it's quite likely that you are just 'collateral damage' in that context. Heartseeker statistics seem extremely skewed, much more so than Faerlina - but unless Alliance puts up a fight on a daily basis, a bit like what you're describing, it may as well be 80:20 H:A there as well, or feel like it. I guess we can just hope that BGs alleviate this issue. PvE might also be a solution, rather than just an insult commonly thrown about on this subreddit.
---
For this to work, the new character must be on a different account, or you won’t be allowed to restore the original. So you need a friend or second account to do this.
---
W... what's a dishonorable kill?
---
What the fuck is your positioning? You ran to her tail, you should never be close to her tail.
---
Thats how it currently works. This is how I farm Jump runs solo.
---
as it isn't unique could a fury war wear two and get 16% movement speed and double healing aura?  
---
imagine a fury war with 16% inc speed that can flash on healing gear to pre-buff for massive self heals in pvp....
---
All jokes and trolling aside, 3 alliance grps of 40 man each in an aoe shitfest can easily cause -1200 HK's. Pepehands. 😳
---
You have it completely backwards, ma'am.
---
Why buy them for 18-30g when you can get up to 20 an hour from pools?
---
So you complain about PvP on a PvP server... while you PvP on a PvP server.
---
Sounds like you just enjoy complaining.
---
Hi, /u/DecrosCZE

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e5ho3e/which_race_is_the_best_for_warrior_pvpwise/). 
---
Oh wow.  Well DONE, lad, well done.
---
Thank you for the advice. The one Rag attempt we did I was very cautious because I know about Lava Burst and I didn't didn't bother powershifting at all because I didn't feel I was comfortable enough with the mechanic. Next run I might feel good enough doing it immediately after he uses it but I know to be very conservative.
---
I believe it flat out decreases your ranking points.
---
Ah, makes sense. So ... Time to do yeti quest!!! And hope next time a mage hanks me, he uses arcane explosion or cone of cold... The joy
---
The people that are just playing the game and not posting about it on Reddit are the majority.
---
Run into the backdoor entrance. Take off your gear. Die. Ghost walk into whichever wing you want in one quick run. Source: alliance player on other server
---
So what rep do you need to be at to get the neck? Exalted?
---
Would be impressive but I doubt it will stack.
---
&gt;  also im not guessing the addon doesnt work, i sayed the data for concurrent players is most likly flawed, 
---
That would mean the addon doesn't work. If the data it's producing is vastly inaccurate, it doesn't work, which is what you're saying. 
---
&gt; up to 4 layers on the biggest servers 
---
Where are you pulling this number from? There's a blue post which says some servers had "more than 3" layers in the first week of September. That's not "up to 4 at launch". I can tell you anecdotally my server **absolutely** had more than 4 layers at launch.
---
&gt; "layers dont change server cap" 
---
Who are you even quoting here?
---
I still don't understand why you're arguing this when you don't have anything to back any of it up and there's so much evidence to the contrary. Are you just not convinced there could possibly be 5-6k concurrent on busy servers?
---
While "second to last" is a correct meaning of penultimate it's also misleading as a translation in this context.
---
Ultimate is the last in a chain, and pen ultimate, is the second to last. If ultimate dps is generally consider best then penultimate would be second best.
---
Your presentation makes it look like it means second worst.
---
Thank you for the response! There is no question really, just after any information people have on the server like what youve given me there and how they are enjoying the server!
---
Do you play Earthshaker yourself? If so, 
---
What's your experience so far?
---
Have you found a nice guild?
---
As I say, I'm just unsure why I'm having trouble communicating, barely any chat in groups or open world. I can only conclude everyone is settled on the server and already made their friends/own community and only speaking in their guilds and I feel rather alienated. That said this is all speculation and I'm going to ramp up the search for a suitable guild tonight. Wish me luck!
---
The reddit policy is an etiquette guideline, not a rule set.
---
But simply refusing to even try to off feedback to the creators will lead to discouragement and them stopping. That’s how you get to the state of this sub, where all you get are shitty memes and whatnot. There’s barely substantial discourse, because people either refuse to partake or respond with comments akin to “no shit Sherlock, we’re not all dumb like you”.
---
can you confirm swordbuff stacking 1:1 with +healing, and sword snapshotting your gear so you can switch to dps gear and keep the awesome heal?
---
You have to br revered only for naxx attun; which is really easy as u get rep from all mobs till revered in dungs; save stones for revered till exalted
---
Just keep walking the yetis in every faction vs faction aoe shitfest.
---
Quel'Serrar is a pretty mediocre tank weapon anyways. and survivability o it is proc-based, so it won't help on pull. If you want survivability on pull - go with Timeworn mace.
---
On bosses, you should exceed that cap with the GCD. Its not possible to spam shield slams and sunders on Onyxia, for example, without becoming rage capped. HS isn't on the GCD, so it's a very functional way of dumping that rage for threat.
---
It is a % of your rating, not your honor. So you can literally see your rank bar shrink and drop ranks in realtime :D
---
&gt;Also we basically make and deliver this plague and we're let off the hook because reasons.

Because Thrall is a bad leader.

GFFP wont help at all with the issue they have which is aggro from p2 to p3.
---
if you are horde you can farm the shellfish turn in quest in shadow prey village. You only have to kill the mobs that are directly in your way or spawn when you open the traps. Its some XP but not a ton. probably 5g per hour at minimum for only the shellfish turn in, with other junk from the mobs you kill probably as much as 10G per hour if you have an efficient path from cage to cage.

I’m pointing out that you’re a piece of shit for griefing players that can’t fight back, and that seems to be your definition of PvP. Sad. Enjoy it now until you get rolled in BGs next week when you’re in here crying about paladins and your long queues at the battlemaster.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Thank you for the info. I warned my mage friends. I gank as a druid in these towns and don't AOE so I won't get caught.
---
You don't have to be flagged for PvP when you're in Orgrimar.  Just disable PvP and you can safely move between Org and UC without every worrying about getting killed.
---
sub 60min MC.... what a dream
---
Strength is by far your best stat as fury. Look at it this way, would you take 25 strength or ~17 agility and 1% hit? If you're already hit called, then the 25 strength is going to be better. If you aren't, then the hit and agility is going to be better.
---
The quest reward, or the quest NPC you should use to scare quest targets in the 3 locations stated?
---
Or people can just not be douchebags and camp others repeatedly. If you don’t like getting dishonorable kills go to a high level zone and pvp.
---
Warlock talking about skill. Lmao
---
Every player gets 108% movement speed with the Minor Speed on Boots enchant.
---
also great rage potion
---
Not undisputed though. The DM maul is comparable until P5 when the +agi enchant comes along.
---
Before that the maul might even edge out slightly better because you can enchant it with an iron counterweight (3% faster attack speed) which does work in feral forms.
---
People just like to talk shit here lmao
---
Says the guy who brags about ganking people in a 40 man raid group hahahaha.
---
Go outside dude, you're getting buttblasted over a video game.
---
Bud, you just said it...its an ENEMY player and they yield a "bag of honor". That answers the question of "is it worth it?" Yes very much so. To the point the game developers reward you for killing said player.
---
If they reward honor, that's hardly griefing my friend. When you get to the point of no honor being involved then you may have ground to stand on but even then it's not much because you did in fact opt into that PvP server.
---
Brilliant
---
Uhm, but the quest NPC can just be summoned in those set locations, no?
---
&gt; And on too of that the pvp blues were added much later than the initial honor patch. 
---
What are you talking about? Blue pvp sets were available with the initial honor system as well and for reputation rewards you have to wait for battlegrounds as well.
---
Thanks bro. Thanks for watching
---
Horde doesn’t have to enter contested zones to travel between continents because the zeppelins are in horde territory thus if you just stay there for 10 minutes you’ll unflag and be unattackable by alliance in horde zones.
---
You just can't move.  Only one person can be moving in the quest area or you fail. I was standing in the cave with thorns. While one priest ran around and one priest stood at the end of the gauntlet healing. And both priests got their benediction
---
Allys are not more pvp oriented on ES EU thank you very much
---
So a steak with some spices(like just salt and pepper) just taste bland i guess...
---
This is the correct answer. 
---
You can have your 5 tier set and it wont agro.
---
Having the same thing happen for us. Theres just not enough for people to do other than level an alt and a lot of people don't want to do that
---
Your leadership may not be having the same thoughts right now as I'd gone through here, but if a tank spot were to come up all these things would be considerations.
---
Anyway, I hope it works out for you. WoW is generally a meritocracy, the best spots tend to go to those who work the hardest for them.
---
Wow, talk about a manchild. You care so much about the random exchange you are not involved in to provide your opinion that no one gives a shit about?
---
You checking the right spots? I’ve found around 10 small thorium nodes in ungoro.
---
&gt;and yellow &amp; special attacks are where almost all of his threath should be coming from
---
White hits give a crapton of threat anyways. Also 3% hit is nothing to scoff at.  
---
&gt; assuming a tank uses heroic on every swing 
---
What is he tanking? Kel'Thuzad? Nothing in current content hits nearly hard enough to provide so much rage.
---
Do you even alt bro?
---
But most of us finished that quest like 2 months ago so no
---
It covers the prologue and now I'm just sitting here waiting for the farm arc
---
Omg open queue motherfuckers I want to play the game. Open queue pls. Make servers bigger! Stop 🛑 writing zug zug! You are doomed to stay in queue!
---
If you arent pvp flagged (your name appears green) before you get on the zep then alliance cant kill you on the flight to UC.  Wait a couple min for the flag to go away before boarding the zep.  Now if you're going to grom gol then they can get you as soon as you zone into STV.
---
Instantly decreases too. There's a few screenshots here of people posting the amount it decreased your total rank by per kill already.
---
yeah as long as you have like 10 people standing with 1-2 healer its gg.
---
This one goes beyond fighting gankers though. Too far imo. Needs a hotfix.
---
Yeah im mostly joking. I get why people would spend that kind of money on hobbies like that. I spend quite alot on food and cooking stuff each month since that’s my passion. Just that people spend that much on what’s essentially cheating in wow... but to each their own.
---
Well night elves developed from trolls; so it amkes sense they wouldnt want to jojn primitive horde? Orcs are harvesting ashenvale; and no one likes undead anyway; so i guess only taurens could be allies with nelfs which they are in moonglade
---
Core leather gloves+dagger are better due to +15 stamina.
---
Killing of a "civilian"-tagged NPC. It will put quite a dent in a player's ranking points - as well as anyone who's a member of said player's group or raid.
---
&gt;I never stated it was true, just that it possible
---
Then explain how is this possible, why are you still dodging? Unless you marginally fail at some terms understanding like "server", "layer", "cap" or for some reason want to just appear as dense as possible, you should be able to explain your logic.
---
I repeat, what do you use as a base for your assumption "it is possible for the server with a single layer to have a cap which exceeds the cap of this layer"? You still keep dodging this particular issue which is the cornerstone of your failure.
---
No it doesn't. Besides it's only usable in 3 places. Also you are not supposed to gank inside neutral towns... Technically you can but it's a dick move :).
---
It would be hilarious to roll into Gadgetzan and see a raid team of mechanical yetis.
---
Camping 40’s and 50’s in these hubs isn’t a “massive amount of time invested into the honor system”. It’s just being a prick. Don’t dish it out if you can’t take it.
---
Thanks I'll have to take a look at that. It will certainly make things easier for me.
---
The main way to make money with tailoring/enchanting isn’t actually making enchants, but abusing price imbalances. Keep an eye on cloth and dust prices on the AH. When cloth costs less than the dust they would make if turned into gear and disenchanted, buy up cloth in large amounts, and sell the resulting dust. You also provide a valuable service to your server by keeping dust prices fair.
---
May I suggest an alt? If you want to stay around the same level as your friends while also grinding gold, leveling another char (mage/hunter/whatever) might be more reasonable. Reason being early grinding for gold is highly inefficieny
---
Yeah I was definitely rooting for him. That’s just terrible terrible RNG, on a match set point to boot. Everyone is shocked about that.
---
That's what I thought as well (I'm new to raiding), but a guy I know is absolutely insisting that everyone in the raid needs to be above 100 fire resist unbuffed. I thought that was excessive. I'm currently sitting at 40 including my own buff.

Dodgson....WE'VE GOT DODGSON HERE!

Cool video but my god are the people they're fighting awful and seemingly bad gear.

What's your gear? How much Spelldmg do you have?

Still, we get large shards from epic items instead of Nexus with patch 1.13. Classic is made in phases and with progression, so we're not sure :-/
---
Ah you like to talk shit I see
---
Muppet
---
Make them worth like -10 honor. Not a big deal if you kill a few by accident, but you wouldn't want to camp them.
---
But it's never explained in any quest or anywhere in-game. That's the issue IMO.
---
Hello There,
---
Go Holy :)
---
53 is perfect lvl for you to go BRD 
---
Stay there once you loot everything / get 55-56 - Remember about quests!
---
Once done with BRD - go LBRS ou can stay there till  59 - try to visit UBRS  
---
\- then you have 1 lvl for Scholo/Strat - pick up any quests and just go and do those dungeons once.. congratz 60 lvl.
---
It's especially good nowadays with all the people farming honor etc etc... just stay hidden !

Imagine we are talking and you say that you would like to purchase a bicycle and I say thats stupid, why dont you just build the whole thing from scratch? And I mean from scratch, not buying and assembling parts. That would be easy. I mean actually forging the parts yourself. You would think Im being silly, you obviously can not build a bicycle by yourself from scratch. But then I say its not true. Technically you have everything you need to build a bicycle from scratch. You can read about welding metal, constructing the whole thing, you can go to school to learn engineering, you have arms and eyes to do the manual labor. So technically you could build a bicycle if you wanted from scratch. This reasoning is technically true. But we both knew its unreasonable to use this reasoning for advocating building your own bicycle. Its not realistic at all. 
---
This is the same thing I hear when people say Spy does nothing else, just getting data from the combat log, so everybody could do it if they wanted. Yes, its true, technically. No, they couldnt do what Spy does realistically. So this argument can not be used to justify using Spy, because everybody knows, its not true. People would not be able to get the data Spy provides without Spy. 
---
&gt; I can't believe you have an opinion on spy whatsoever if you don't even play this game lol.
---
I see no reason why. Im not american, but I have a very strong opinion on their president. I don't own slaves, but I have an opinion on slavery. Im not a female but I still have an opinion on abortion. Why the heck should I not have an opinion on an addon that I know very well how works or in what way alters gaming experience thanks to countless testimony here and on youtube? I could very well establish an informed opinion on this matter via all the material present.
---
Anyway, we not gonna come to terms within this debate. The only thing I dont like is when people say "Spy is okay, because it does nothing that you couldnt do by yourself". Thats not true. Apart from that, I dont care why you use Spy or why think it is okay.
---
Found one of the guys that OP tricked.
---
Fuck them. Neutral city should be just that. If you want to gank someone in open world? Sure, that’s part of the game. But blizzard has literally discouraged killing in cities, that’s why you have so many guards. They just never expected such neckberdia to have such disregard for others for the sake of “earning” kills.
---
Please for the love of god, create something to include said death threats.  I will pay good money to see that.
---
Alliance being camped by horde disagree
---
*plays the worlds smallest violin*
---
Do you have any idea if there is one such discord for mages as well
---
It's  a flat 100 rank point drop per DHK regardless of rank, but 100 RP at high rank is way more severe as the margins for outpacing decay get thinner.
---
Oh interesting. Haven't logged in since honor patch was launched (I quit a bit before). That's a lot of deaths...
---
Usually, I die once when I land at flightmaster, twice going down the hill, once in the blackrock castle (or whatever it,s called) entrance, then I get camped by 2 night elf rogues inside, and then it's all good. I guess this must've gotten even worse with the honor patch o_o
---
Not with paladin
---
So I went to see if this was true, and it was.  
---
But I saw something even worse

---
This right here. Having played both alliance an horde mage before paladins are you’re greatest enemy lol. They kinda neglect the whole frost mage spec since its more based around controlling you’re enemies with slows/cc’s then quick dmg. Especially combing them with a warrior and the one class that would normally would not even hit you just runs in and 2 taps you haha. Shouldve went gnome again but my mate wanted to play a sham this time so i followed him :(
---
Dude just make 3 raid grps of 40 man each. Make sure they have 10 charges of this item each and just walk the yetis into aoe shitfest at blackrock or ANY faction vs faction aoe. Thats 1200 DHKs in a matter of MINUTES.
---
We shall call it - The alliance strikes back. Best kamikaze strat ever. The only choice they have is to stop aoe. In this case it will be sooooooo easy to break through their lines and crush them. Use their numbers against them.
---
Wut? Lol.  There are terrible players of all classes that are just as likely to wipe you as a hunter. In this video alone if a priest was paying attention they could've just dispelled and saved the pet from agroing.
---
I just don't understand the hate for hunters that you seem to have.
---
Maybe you can buy some keybinds now
---
It's hard to find a spot. I got lucky with my guild, I joined right as we were seriously getting ready to raid and had both excellent gear and friends in the guild to vouch for me. My previous guild regularly asked me to respec

I'm looking to be the MT of our 2nd raid on my warrior. We dont want to pull outside the guild, the RL of group 1 knows I'm reliable so the spot will almost certainly be mine. I suspect many guilds do this, your MT needs to be dedicated to the guild, and people already deep into it are that type
---
The same way horde camping roofs in low level towns is considered griefing yet GMs refuse to do anything about it?
---
:D:D:D

Most of the time it takes me an hour fishing these to get one essence of water. It's no where near that easy with the current population servers.
---
Advocating my server, bloodfang. One of the newer servers, always medium to high pop. Balance was perfect, then a couple of alliance guilds migrated - now it feels slightly biases towards alliance. 
---
Server is progressing well, first sulfuras hammers are getting forged right now etc.
---
Especially of they only group rp with rp. That's two servers, with very very low horde numbers.
---
I would argue that while there’s certainly nothing inherently wrong with a quest like this, it needs to be properly rewarded. Respecting the player’s time is important. If the only reward for this quest is some XP and a bit of silver, the player has every right to be peeved at this kind of design IMO.
---
Gotem!
---
Why do I need keybinds, when they're all on my mouse under my thumb? &gt;:D

I got the demon in silithus to 10-15% all the time then run into a bug, lol

As /u/Sebastianthorson said below, I've yet to tank a boss that leaves me rage capped.

Sure I dump sometimes with HS, but nowhere near every swing.

And blizzard never changed that since vanilla?

It's usable in all places.

What's the mod for the extended stat window?

That's what a razor naga is for!

you misspell 'hear'

Let me get a cup and catch those sweet, sweet tears.

Not super. It will benefit from Shadow Weaving but you'll probably kill most mobs before it stacks up. A higher-DPS wand is more important.
---
5 DKs in a row loses you 1500 RP.  -100 for the first, -200 for the second, -300 for the third, etc.
---
In a short enough window the RP lost increases with each successive kill.  Gfg.
---
Reddit is an endless tabloid my dude. It's just bullshit, drama and eye catching shit for as far as the eye can see.

Have you met and people trying to get rank 14? Majority of them are huge babies, people were ready to quit last week when honor wasn't updating correctly.

who gives a fudge, 9/10 times the hunter pets stay blue even though they are clearly attacking you.

i mean, there could be yes, but i thinks its more likely less,

noone knows for sure and the data we all have is atleast vage

Fish in southern STV on the west coast (south of grom'gol). You get oily blackmouth, firefin snappers and stonescale eel, as well as some sweet stuff from floating wreckage nodes.

Iirc they added the blue pvp sets along with t0.5 as a catch-up mechanic?
---
yeah but there is a part he goes in the quest building and like everyone in there is red
---
i understand the sheep part but this is later in the vod no sheep at all
---
It's just not a good state of the game and I don't really see long BG ques for the inflated faction changing the merciless corpse camping that will slowly drive the smaller faction away
---
 Sounds like you should've split that a bit differently.
---
They are fully aware but are doing it for honor.
---
Most of it is people who are doing this are hoping that everyone else doesn't attack them because they are honorless and that they will get the bulk of the damage on the target resulting in decent honor gain. Their hope is that the target will panic and attack them back removing honorless. 
---
If everyone waits the full 30 seconds and 10 people get a hit on them you're gona get maybe 20 honor or so and now that target is on DR for you. If you just fuck everyone else over and attack while the target is honorless and everyone is waiting, there is a decent chance the target will attack you back and you'll get like 150 honor or so. 
---
Worst case senario you get screwed out of the initial 20 honor and that target is going to res in a minute or 2 anyway.
---
&gt; They aren’t killing you for honor, they will slaughter you regardless.
---
It's like people like you don't remember the game in phase 1. Nobody was camping flight paths like this before the honor system released yet you have some weird idea in your head that people are just out there slaughtering people at flight points for the fun of it. 
---
Look at the evidence and facts you have available and draw your conclusions from that rather than starting with the premise that people are just out there to slaughter you for no reason and molding the facts and evidence around that premise.
---
I can't say with any certainty, I've only just started my priest in classic.. 
---
But I thought shadow form did increase it, in vanilla at least.  
---
The tooltip says shadow damage, not shadow spell damage. 
---
But, I dunno, could go either way :D

Because horde players are literally shitty people.

Whirlwind axe is trash, sword is best for the miss recovery.

Alliance were out everywhere last night, good contingent hit UC a few times and was some great pvp!

Who mentioned racial slurs??

You speak about dodging?

Maybe take the time to reply to mine, you dodged every single question I had. 
---
&gt;"it is possible for the server with a single layer to have a cap which exceeds the cap of this layer"?
---
OK I will reply once again, but Iam sure you will still act like I haven't responded. It's just depend on how it's implemented by blizzard, it's about a threshold they choose. You are stating that this threshold is the same with and without layering, which is 100% assumption. Iam just arguing that this isn't 100% true and just about what you think. Again I never stated it was the case just that it's a possibility. 
---
I find funny that you want people to explain the stuff they said when they are hypothetical and you don't feel like explaining anything when you used authority argument without data or anything.

You don't have to reply this time, I won't continue the discussion.

Wow, the guy who wants easy mode changed vanilla telling someone else to go to the pirate servers where that nonsense comes from. Cry more bud, sorry you never wanted vanilla.

It's used for soloing tough demons/elementals and other soloing activities- apply curse of doom, then banish.  banish breaks, curse of doom goes off, lots of yummy damage. not sure about the enslaving part.

That isn’t how /who works

While yes, it does cost a lot of rep.  And rep is not quickly farmed from them.

Mik's scrolling battle text (MSBT)

I mean they did actively fight Humans in the WC3 campaign prior to the Battle of Mount Hyjal.

They have *less* reasons to dislike the Alliance but they were still definitely not part of it, or on particularly good terms with it, prior to WoW.

You should be sweeping strike/ cleaving 2-3 per pull.

Org zep tower is pretty well-patrolled by alliance on my server. It’s not constant, but you can expect it. Traveling to or from grom’gol, a frequently used hub due to its proximity to BRM? GG
---
I've done +20 runs with no crystals dropping, and then bam, 5 in a row. It really is RNG with these, and it can make some goldruns feel pointless, and others like this is the single best gold farm in the game.

It's probably in-between these two extremes.

At what point did i say it was a bad thing?

99% of the time I love it, 3 word for you:

Tbh the alliance had it coming with their sinful elves

Fury prot is a lot of fun but it requires a good chunk of gear. Pre bis wont really cut it. You need good crit to keep flurry up, but also some very good mit pieces to balance the threat gear and let you dual wield. Basically you need to be stacked on raid gear before it is better than deep prot. 
---
For 5 mans though it’s totally viable. And you can still dps okay with it, but you’re at a slight disadvantage.
---
At 60 what’s the go to shard farming area?
---
the other day I was in a party with a druid, 2 hunter and a shammy, as fury war I had a macro with charge + battle shout, but bs on 7 ppl are insane aggro if done in the first few seconds of pull, so when I used charge + bs all the mobs spun around me instantly nullifying the druid's work

Like I said in my reply I’m on Dragons Call.

Does this work in duel as well? Like ultimate level of trolling is to use these ina duel against a guildmate...

i hope you see this and you will thank me later. go to interface, addons settings, dejastats addon, and reset its settings then untick the numbers you don't want to see. this will color each of the section in to the right of your char cheat to the talent colored background.

they should just consolidate all the population imbalance complaints into a megathread

You are the hero we needed. I'm on the minority for my faction, and I have 4 yetis just sitting in my bank...

In cases where you're playing vs lowbies and idiots definitely. Vs premade games you want control and persistence, not burst.
---
Isn't that the hope? That people that caught up with the game and do non-stop hk farming in neutral towns find a new, non-yeti, gaming experience?

You’ll end up quitting like everyone else on pvp servers. Re-roll now and quit bitching about the choices you made.

Herod is supposedly heavily horde-favored yet somehow alliance always control blackrock mountain, EPL, and dire maul. I really don't mind because it's just another quirk of phase 2 and will be over soon, but the fact of the matter is that numbers aren't the whole story.

His scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.

Notice the lack of reply when you're right and the problem no longer matters to OP who claims Ally are ruining his time. This yeti trick was practically made for them!
---
I disagree. Part of the fun of playing on a PvP server is the possibility of being ganked unfairly, whether it's a group of 5 people your level or a 60 - it makes no difference, either way you're dead and there's no way for you to fight back.
---
It makes the world feel dangerous. Of course, faction imbalance is definitely a problem but I wouldn't want 60s to stop ganking lowbies.
---
That being said, if you corpse camp lowbies you're a dick.
---
You love to see it happen
---
I was under the impression of the yeti being summonable 3 times.
---
any class that can wield a 2h sword... 
---
i mean... imagine a warrior putting on loaded +healing cloth gear. equipping sword. swapping back to regular gear, then basically dropping a small health pot every 5 seconds with no global, no cooldown.
---
Character transfers are only available on servers with a very large population and in some cases only available to the dominant faction.
---
I am a horde on a horde dominated pvp server and i approve of this message. At the start of P2 I was rolling in the deathsquads like everyone else. Now I maybe get 100 HKs a week, shit is so stale and obviously unhealthy for the long term progress of the game.
---
Troll is far from good warrior in pvp... orc, undead, tauren, human, gnomes, dwarfs all are better...
---
Mind me asking which server you're playing on?
---
Ironfoe has quite a low proc-rate (3%, 1 ppm, iirc). I do not believe that such proc rate is high enough to overcome the dps differential between the two weapons.
---
Yes, that's how it works.

On blaumeux server allied always camp Gadget. Non stop 24/7

What is that font?

If you are br1 each week and ate 5 dhk you'll have to rank for 6 more weeks to hit r14

The burning steppes demon is really easy.

Scorpid Sting then melee until ~10 seconds left on scorpid sting, then wing clip run away and scorpid when he enrages.  
---
Rinse and repeat, collect head.
---
Yes. The first DK is relatively small, the subsequent ones are massive
---
Do those things proc if you're just hanging around not in combat? Like I've never seen guards retaliate against a player for just buffing up next to an enemy faction player in neutral towns.

You know the nazis had pieces of flair!

Same way you can carry thousands of arrows

Use the site sixtyupgrades. Create a custom ep set with the only stat as nature resist. Then just manually look through the high resist options to see what items you actually want

This isn't retail. They aren't hot fixing things you don't like!

You son of a bitch, I'm in.

You can cheese the Silithus and Steppes ones and make the fights trivial.
---
Silithus: bring a warlock friend, duel him, have him cast Curse of Recklessness on you. Stay in the duel area. The curse means you can use rank 3 wing clip on the demon to root him in place for a very long time and his fear won't work. Still bring bandages and a mana potion, but it's *so* much easier this way.
---
Steppes: There's a tree bent over on the hill/mountain near where you find him. You can jump on and off the end of the tree and the demon will run all the way around to try and get to you. You can do the whole fight without him getting anywhere near you.

As for Un'Goro, literally just run in a circle around the lake, it's the easiest one. Good luck!

That’s how I see people who claim it’s a joke or meme after shitting themselves with fury because PvP happened on a PvP server
---
I would try to find the server discord first see if there is any action there. If not - go to ogrimmar. You will see at least 1 member of the guild in peak times and PM them in the most polite way that you are looking for a guild and if they have a recruitment process. For me personally I didn't aim for the top guild but for the one with best community and I'm very happy with what I did. We are all casuals but very serious when we do stuff and it is a very friendly enviroment. But yeah...always go the polite way and don't push people. For example I explained 2 guys we have a recruitment process through our discord and website and they almost rage that we don't accept people just like that even though I explained our raid comp have been together since level 1 and we are just trying to get to know people before recruting
---
Nah, I don't mind giving honor back. I killed a lot of alliance last few weeks, the least I can do is to give some of it back.
---
I did my entire small thorium grind in Ungoro in a few hours.
---
Orc is hands down the best Race for PvP for any class.
---
I appreciate it, i just would rather pay then going through the aggrivation.
---
I see noobs attack city’s. I just kill them
---
I'm glad theres the thing in Strat that works in the world. Sorry, Pvpgod that just 5v1d lowbies. What is it? Git Gud? Learn how to target. I cant wait to grief.
---
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.
---
Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
---
As a fellow bene hoarde, I leveled from 50 to 59 virtually entirely in dungeons or running in 10 man raid groups to avoid certain death by ganking. 
---
Although the whole “capture the flag” sort of fun group on group ganking in eastern p and winter spring has been fun.
---
So hordes are gonna "guard" the NPC's now lol
---
Looking forward to see people pop them at BRM on a raid day. Ez 1-2 ranks lost
---
I think Pyrewood is good, as an alliance.
---
You managed to suggest 2 of the worst PvP races for warrior. 
---
OP should go either orc (op resist stun), dwarf (stronger vs rogues / hunters / shadowpriests)  or gnome (escape artist is always good)
---
What do you mean usually because it’s never worked like that.
---
2 prot warriors per 40 raiders.
---
vs 1 tank per 5 dungeon ppl
---
It would be extremely painful.
---
Need suggestions for max dps output PVE and that also work with pvp warrior spec.
---
I just obtained obsidian edge blade. got onyxia nec. pre raid bis items, Hit capped. Need advice with decent build.  
---
trying hamstring build right now but im really not that impressed since im really depending on the shaman around me. 
---
Help me out boys!
---
So if they were "griefed", or corpse camped by a raid in a city for a week or two, you think that's all right whereas trying to finish this quest is not?
---
And you can throw your hyperbolic IRL analogies out of the window. 
---
This is not how you ruin a community;  it just might be how you ruin a raid that's corpse camping players a neutral city.
---
I know what you feel, that's why I'm on pve server cause I don't like being forbidden to quest by a lv60 roaming.
---
If I remember, you don't gain honnor by killing a grey ennemy so maybe with some time people will get tired of farming lower levels I don't know, anyway it's the spirit of the game, all we can do is chosing a pve server, which is better than nothing imo. 
---
Also, you can enjoy your situation cause it means reaching 60 on a pvp server brings more pride than on a pve one.
---
In the end as I said the matter is not skill it's behaviour, your choice will participate in the shaping of the future of wow classic
---
Questions of procs and scaling.
---
So I recently bought the Bow Of Searing Arrows that has a chance to do like 14-25 fire damage on crit hits. Last night I got a knife that gives +14 fire spell damage. Does this affect my bow’s proc? Because I know some hunter instant casts are scaled with spell damage (like arcane shot)
---
Thanks for the advice, I would just rather pay someone then go through the aggrivation
---
Pack it in everyone this person has experienced everything and knows how everyone's mind works
---
Exactly people gonna be mad and its hilarious
---
Does anyone have a keybind set up they are particularly fond or believe is intuitive they mind sharing? I'm struggling to get something completely fleshed out and it's an ever changing system. I'd like to start developing muscle memory for something that works. I'm looking to use Q E R T F G X X C V with some shift or control mouse over macros.
---
Details has a tracker for pots, buffs, and dispels/cleanses
---
There is no honor in killing someone more than 5 levels lower than you. Facts.
---
Guards are not inherently hostile to you.
---
It's really not that bad the first few weeks. It takes around 100 ranking points immediately but if you are getting around 10k+ ranking points per week 100 isn't much. I got two in one week and still went from rank 3 to rank 5. They only really start hurting when you are rank 11+ because after weekly decay you might only be bringing in hundreds of ranking points per week so a 100 point hit actually matters.
---
I have a 29 mage and 31 druid(feral). Do you think I could do anything with either of those? I don’t think the mage is strong enough to farm DM by himself.
---
So yeah it’s an issue. 1 in 5 for groups, 2 in 40 for raids (for the most part all other tanking can be done with DPS Warriors/feral Druids in raids)
---
Your best chance if you don’t have a tank spot now is go DPS and try and get tank gear when you can. After ZG and AQ20 come out I promise there will be times that your guild MT and OT can’t be at every raid and you will get your shot. Save your gold for respecing in this phase.
---
In the mean time tank whenever needed in raids and tank 5 mans for guildies. If you are sitting in preraid BIS there isn’t a dungeon boss you can’t tank as Fury or Arms. Be vocal that you want to tank but don’t nag or complain about it. Your MT could burn out or get poached by another guild. It happened in Vanilla all the time. 
---
Good luck my dude.
---
Imagine ganking lowbies and calling it pvp...
---
Yea, I too noticed the lack of a reply.
---
&gt; At about 2 or 3 levels below you you should get NEGATIVE honor.
---
Isn't that what a DK is? Although it's a lot more forgiving in the level range.
---
I said that it takes 15mins, if it's like 3 or 5AM and nobody is online to help. And I'm not whining, I just pointed put that horde get camped too. It's not like an alliance exclusive thing, even though it's worse on alliance due to how you respond to the issue.
---
Right, people don't do dungeons or raid, people don't hit 48+ on their alts
---
Feral Druid ahahhaa
---
They bring what locks typically do, strong cc with lots of damage.  It was tempting to move up to 49 for deathcoil but I wanted a 39 twink and a warlock twink.
---
If you're pvping a lot already it wouldn't hurt. If you're not, I didn't switch till about 56 and I wanted to start getting things in line for end game.
---
Atiesh. I have both Horde and Ally toons there, but the only 60 is Horde.
---
Dont you have MS or Bloodthirst?
---
You need a better weapon, Whirldwind axe was good 10 Levels ago not any more.
---
Just arrived at work and have never been so overjoyed to see this series of comments. I snorted my coffee through my nose. Never change, guys, never change.
---
How much time was left on the blind before you tried to reopen?
---
1 tank below all furies on threat, casters wand p1
---
. Everyone unleashes all hell at 68% to get her as low as possible in the transition. Rogues keep sinister striking her the entire p2. 
---
We usually get around 4-6 fireballs and then she comes down. Never see DB. Rogues vanish, Hunters feign. Usually she goes through a couple people before landing on a tank. Both tanks reck + Mighty Raeg and just tps like motherfuckers. It's important ppl control their dicks when she is still moving around and let it land on a tank that gets control.
---
And 75% of your shit unbound
---
I had a blast using fury prot in 5mans. I think it really shines there. But I am also very well geared. 
---
Even then, it’s not quite optimal for MC. I have MTd as fury prot some nights, worked fine, parsed high. But realistically deep prot is pumping out just about the same threat and you’re a bit less squishy. DPS just aren’t geared enough for needing that extra threat. Once BWL gear is all over, we will probably want 2 fury prots just to keep up. But right now it’s just for fun.
---
I don't defend enemy cast bar addons. I do indeed think they are less problematic and less immoral than Spy, which is also the opinion of the wow community based on the number of complaints about the above mentioned addons.
---
&gt; As far as the opinion thing, you used 3 examples of things that are actually important, and the use of Spy is not something I would think important enough for someone to have an opinion on when they don't even play the game, that's all.
---
So I shouldnt have an opinion on Spy, because you don't think it is important enough for me to have one. I think we have reached to a point where I just can not take you seriously anymore. Lets just agree that I can and I should have an opinion on everything I myself deem important enough. Thank you for the discussion, and have a lovely week.
---
Yes. Thats actually WHY I'd do it. Ive already unsubbed and have to wait for it to expire. I quit when it became impossible to do anything for the past 3 weeks. I dont even care if i get banned. Time to shit on this garbage "community" and be out. Fuck em
---
No it makes your stupid thoughts easier to read tho.
---
I don't believe horde and alliance players are any different so I'm sure they would.
---
It is. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not player vs player. Ganking lowbies is pvp. Killing people when they're AFK is pvp. Camping instance portals is pvp.
---
Imagine rolling on a server that allows people to kill lowbies and then getting mad that people kill lowbies.
---
Hopefully blizzard fixes that, it can be used for all sorts of griefing
---
Ohh poor poor boy u got ganked from a lvl 60 on lvl 20 1 time and now Ure pissed? U still know u got ganked there now imagine u got ganked so many times by bobs like u that u couldn’t remember the first lvl 20 gank cause there was Atleasnearlyeveryt 50 lvl 60s doing same till you hit 40 and you understand how it is to play alliance on  a pvp Server
---
My server has plenty of people who won't leave because of silly shit like pvp. We'll do war effort easily
---
Go fishing only after midnight till 6am. theres where you can drop nightfin snappers, wich are the most profitable, at least on my server. other times you get also those health regen fish....so dont waste your time fishing before midnight. 
---
My startegy is always: Felwood water elementals after midnight -&gt; get on the lil island, farm the watereles on respawn and inbetween you catch some fish. 
---
Last night i did 3-4hrs and dropped 4 essence of water and 89 nightfins (which is like 50-60g when you sell the manareg soups)
---
Skeram need YOU!
---
Elemental becomes faster to level than enhance around 40 so your past due by that metric. Its a good pvp build and lets you stop carrying around 2 sets of gear!
---
It's either against the rules or not. Cross faction collusion is against the rules. 
---
Whether or not they are good at punishing those who break rules is another question.
---
Thanks for self identifying as a douche and helping me to keep my block list full.  Bye bye Felicia, pleasure knowing I will never read your ignorant comments again.
---
Got my raptor in my orc rogue.. i can die happy now.
---
I can only hope one day you'll look back at how you are now and feel deep shame.
---
Horde can camp with a yeti too, this is kinda making it worst
---
Last I checked, you can go 10 levels below.
---
Just because random shitters who can't handle pvp leaves doesn't mean the entire faction does.. There's plenty of tryhard players on ally who will do war effort.
---
Dont think he meant he raids as holy and respecs, think he meant he raids as holy and has imp threat talents.
---
well do em solo and get all veins at the end ;) its pretty easy as deep fire, but needs ingi to make it easy for the satyr boss. once you got the jukes its easy done in 30mins per run
---
Orc for Horde, Gnome for Alliance
---
I was running combat swords (19/32/0) with +10% hit from gear (mask of the unforgiven, 2 tarnished elven rings, the bracers from the beast, devilsaur set, Truestrike Shoulders, Satyr Bow)
---
I think the SnD was up most of the time, since i was focusing too much on that instead of Eviscerate, which is one of the reasons my dps was bad.
---

My gear was like that during the raid:

DW, I can widow her for you.
---
Typical dps warrior hyperbole.
---
"PvP killing in open world? Completely fine." "Abusing a quest to grief people with DHKs? BAN!!!"
---
how are those even remotely the same thing?
---
M8, im on dreadmist aswell with my 60 war, my name is Geeralt ingame, hmu when youre 60, id be glad to help
---
If you go by ironforge.pro which uses logs to census numbers then the alliance and horde have similar numbers on ZT. If you faction mates arent logging pn then drive recruitment and get more onboard.
---
can mods just start removing these threads?
---
\+10% from gear and +5% from talents
---
I'm not even someone who has been honor grinding, I've also been camped and killed travelling to dungeons and raids, but I signed up for a PvP server, it's not the "hardcore" players fault that this is the way they currently have to rank, it's all they have to work with.
---
If you want to compare that to going out of your way to abuse a quest bug to purposely ruin hours and hours of someones honor grind because they happen to kill a level 1 NPC with 1 health for a DK while they are killing you, on a pvp server, fairly, then go ahead - but you're still an asshole.
---
this is wrong
---
Did I ever say it was hard? I did not. Naxx is quite simplistic compared to other pve things in later expansions or games. But out of anything in vanilla it is the most challenging.
---
Ahh gotcha. I'm on a PvE server, so I am ignorant.
---
120 eyes = rank 12 to rank 1 in a flash. Sounds fun.
---
Just want to throw this out there... That this may be fun for PvP, but should be used sparingly on pve TM vs SS raids. Aka when alliance get over run by the horde because the civ distribution through the town is terrible for alliance unlike it is for horde. 
---
But if you just whip this out and send it in outside of TM as an alliance? then that is a surefire way to kill world PvP for a few hours, or even permanently until BG's drop. (If abused enough)
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking... I can't even cast more than 1 blessing on a person so why am I getting ALL of the improved versions?  The most important one, Salvation, isn't even talentable.  If I'm the only Paladin in the raid, would I even be using any of those aside from maybe Kings on the tanks?
---
I wouldn't mind at all going 31 into Holy, but asking me to completely give up the Ret tree AND anything deeper than Kings in the Prot tree just seems unreasonable.  As a 31/20/0 or a 31/0/20 I can still either tank some things OR farm/quest decently.  A pure heal-bot can't do anything alone in a reasonable timeframe unless I'm mistaken.
---
Blizzard knows exactly if you are completing a quest or griefing.
---
CDL is trash
---
Tell it to the mirror
---
That would be delicious
---
That's brilliant, thanks for sharing your experience it's been really helpful! I'll definitely go about my guild search with all that in mind.
---
Again thanks for the advice and best of luck on all your WOW endeavours!
---
Pretty much scales downward with level.
---
19 is obviously the big one, followed by 29.
---
39-49 aren't nearly as popular and 59 is pretty rare.
---
If you're playing classic for skill and talent you picked the wrong game buddy
---
Being someone that only played on and off after vanilla then quit completely when pandas came out, it was a bit of an adjustment.
---
I remember the struggle it was to clear MC/BWL/AQ40 for the first time, and the weeks it took to get there.
---
Meanwhile in classic, we made it upto Rag with pugs that werent even on voice chat the second reset. With people basically in whatever gear they got leveling.
---
I do, however, expect people to cause many wipes on Vael as they chase numbers.
---
I had no idea this is how the yeti works, I had it sitting in my bank.  I knew it might be worth it one day.
---
No, this affect everyone, everyone will be able to use this to grief, wether its a fair fight or not. I mean its not rocket science....
---
Nice. Congrats.
---
Genius!
---
Fixed. Good catch. I’d be ok with horse ganks.
---
If those are meant to be her eyelashes it doesn't look very good.
---
Imagine quitting because someone ruined your time spent ruining everyone's time. 
---
*camps you for 2 hours* *1 DK* REEEEEEEE
---
Could be, I guess I have to see next raid.
---
Was just looking if I maybe missed something or did something wrong that caused the high missrate. 
---
You know stuff where I can improve on :) But maybe its just bad luck.
---
Oh, dunno then. This add on as no options like that
---
&gt; It's either against the rules or not.
---
Yes, and it's not. It used to be in Vanilla, but it isn't in Classic.
---
Not 100% sure but I don't think +spell damage affects item/weapon procs in the game.
---
so it saves 2 hours of time cus it saved each member 3 minutes? thats is some brutal bigbrain maths
---
Focus on using it in bosses that actually benefit from being killed faster.
---
On Lucifron you're probably more useful as a decurser. Even mages will be decursing. So not worth using.
---
On Garr, it's a waste. Even if the buff doesn't get removed, you're still gonna be in-and-out of melee too much to make efficient use of a 30 secs buff.
---
Geddon can be tricky because as soon as you use it, he might make you the bomb. So I'd not recommend it.
---
Sulfron, Gehennas and Domo are good for it, but there's so much target switching that it might be wasteful to use it.
---
Magmadar, Shazzrah, Golemagg and Ragnaros are good fights for it. Mix with a protection potion if you got a couple of gold to spare.
---
Eh, is this pet summonable elsewhere than the quest locations? I believe it's restricted to close to the quest NPC targets, am I missing something?
---
It really doesn't, lol. you can 100% raid flask full world buff consume on a mage and a warrior every week. It's not even hard. Also, if you're looking for a class and you get bored of your warrior and you pick mage, you have a big surprise in store.
---
Is getting every improved blessing AND BoK a typical raid spec?  Seems like if you were smart, you'd try to coordinate with other paladins to cover all improved blessings as needed while not gimping the entire corps unnecessarily.
---
The only thing I could possibly think is that, with spell-batching as bad as it is, you re-open the rogue with cheap shot and a melee hit goes off during the same batch, in turn allowing the opposing rogue to attempt to use a spell. If the opposing rogue is successful, there is a chance that it occurs in the same batch. This would especially make sense if you use a macro like this:
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast cheap shot
---
/startattack
---
Overall though it seems like a bit of a stretch - spell-batching is complete garbage but I don't think it could even get THIS bad.
---
lol sick burn you got me
---
Did it happen at the pickup spot? Because zeppelins have a guard/guards that interfere and don’t allow for around the clock griefing
---
Are you actually that dense or just acrting? You do realize this can be used by 
---
1. The horde, they can kill you AND provide you with DK's
---
2. By players wanting to grief others players even if its a fair PVP situation
---
This isn’t a GoT alias.
---
Why can't alliance just stop being bad at pvp?
---
its 12 levels, I'm on skeram and we know that lvl 48 alliance give honor very well.

Absolutely not a misplay. Sheeping a druid as a form of counterspell also forces them into a form to escape, which costs mana and at least one additional global cooldown ontop
---
Sheeping a druid repeatedly is stupid, but once or twice can be useful in particular scenarios.

Wow census has bigglesworth population (in the last 14 days) more active 60 allaince  than horde. Crazy.
---
A lot of factors depend on how difficult BWL will be for your guild. If you’re good, 1 meme spec shouldn’t be a problem.
---
Lol nah not rly it’s like Füllung cause if u got ganked u wait 5 min as ghost take corpse spit on everyone and just go on quasten next to them
---
Imagine exploiting something unintended.  Say, for instance, grabbing a bunch of buddies and camping people in town while taking advantage of poor guard mechanics.
---
Oof...Pally tanking is tough when you're specced for it. If he's just holy then may the Light have mercy on him.
---
&gt; Although the whole “capture the flag” sort of fun group on group ganking in eastern p and winter spring has been fun.
---
I think that's in the spirit of PvP and I'd wager that both factions had a good time.
---
Ret with 5 reckoning stacks can one-shot.

You have to be dense to type this considering ALL the changes that already has happen xD

I saw someone doing this yesterday and thought he was a genius !

It's usually  done way better. Those eyelashes are so off.
---
He cracked the code
---
I can have a look through it after work. Sorry for the delay in seeing your message.
---
At this point, it *seems* less that you want to help me improve than you want to make yourself look smarter by criticizing someone else's performance. In this case you were criticizing something that wasn't actually wrong (i.e. pointing out I wasn't stance dancing in situations where it really wasn't necessary to dance). I suspect you gave up and deleted your comments because you realized you were maybe pushing in the wrong direction. Some people admit they made a mistake, and some people delete the evidence of the mistake.
---
I am open to hearing criticism and advice. I solicit for both. I even thanked you for a macro idea (that you have deleted). You helpfully suggested some other good macros (that you've also deleted), but seemed to get annoyed when I mentioned I already use them.
---
But not all criticism and advice is always correct or useful. Not everyone who criticizes or advises actually knows what they're talking about. Some folks do know what they're talking about, and give good criticism and advice in general, but may not realize that general info isn't useful for specific examples. You apparently do have a good grasp of tanking (you're probably great at the activity), and you want to share your understanding (an admirable trait). But in the case of our discussion, you seemed to want to shoehorn some good general advice into a specific situation where it didn't necessarily fit. I didn't say your advice was wrong, nor did I dismiss the advice. I thanked you when you gave information directly useful to me and my situation, and just mentioned that I already knew and used your other advice. I don't know why that annoyed you.
---
Some other folks here have given good general advice that does fit this specific situation (e.g. binding target symbols to keys). I'm grateful for that advice, and will use it.
---
I don't post my videos for criticizing. I post my videos for a record of fun gaming experiences. I do invite criticism and advice from anyone willing to watch and reply, but that's not the purpose of posting. I appreciate that you took the time to watch my video, and to respond to it.
---
Hmm, salty. Just how I like it.
---
Rereading your statement...yeah you did.
---
This was exactly what I was looking for!  I wish it did pets as well but everything else was perfect
---
Yikes
---
Good to know. Thanks for the clarification.
---
The obvious joke response would be “Tourette’s?” But I know that coprolalia is a fairly rare tic even among those who actually have the syndrome.
---
Curious about this too. I use the 1-4, extra mouse button,scroll and in combo with control and shift. To get even more stuff easily available. Hope an experienced player answers. :p
---
It's supposed to diminish 20% per kill. Not sure what the cooldown period is.
---
This is the way!
---
I don't care about their enjoyment of the game or any payoff for their work any more or less than they cared for mine. It already made me unsub, so I at least get to try to return the favor of ruining something they had been enjoying.
---
This is a known issue, check the giant druid bug list on the blizzard forums or go to the druid discord. You have to manually cancel the aura in your macro. This also happens to predatory strikes.
---
I played vanilla with a belgian guy who farmed DHK. We keept him out of raid/groups till we were in the dungeon for our ranks saftey.
---
I asked a similar question a while ago (about gear, not meme specs but similar thought) and the consensus was: certain fights in bwl are not easy and require DPS to really step it up. So take that as you will.
---
This can be done to both sides... so, hope your friends who have been trying to rank up enjoy it as well. Scummy.
---
There is no honor in the honor system.
---
BWL is harder both in coordination &amp; mechanics.
---
It also has some fights like Vael (2nd boss) that are hard DPS checks. You plain and simply won't be able to progress past this part unless you have enough DPS.
---
&gt;Imagine acting tough and having to validate yourself over a game mode  
---
You view what i just said as "acting tough"?  That is what acting tough looks like to you?  Oh hunny...
---
If it upsets you this much, you’re taking the *game* too seriously.
---
You don’t understand. .2 seconds is the rate at which Blizzard changes anything that Paladins do that is considered fun
---
I don't kill honourless targets but your seething rage might just convince me to do otherwise.
---
Orc and Gnome. Don't sleep on Gnome melee, EA OP.
---
Not the sharpest tool in the shed huh? You do realize the horde can use it too? Also you compare PVP to an exploit :D :D :D
---
Yes but some people like me dont care abt ranks. Just like some people on horde who will be completely be unaffected by the yetis. Killing civilians of the opposite faction only makes them happier. Like a true psycopath. 😂
---
They just want to see the world burn. 😂

Let the bodies hit the floor

The server shutdown just happened but when it comes back up I'll try to see their names on Spy. I know one was a dwarf rogue in Hillsbrad, who for the love of god, I couldn't beat. And full disclosure I'm not a great PvPer.
---
Consider having a druid backup.
---
I've been on whelp duty for the last several Ony clears.
---
I stay really low on aggro meter in phase 1, mostly just building rage to burn on whelps.

In phase 2, I  I tank the whelps while main tanks do jumping jacks underneath Ony.
---
In phase 3, I'm supposed to race the main tanks for threat, as a "just in case"
---
I use a crowd pummeler and so far I've been the one picking her up in phase 3.
---
If I weren't a "just incase" I would be Hot'ing the Locks during phase 2, and chain spamming my faire fire on cool down. So that I climb the meters before she lands.
---
Nop there are just melee fights and caster fights .When Warlocks can go all in and not worry about aggro they can beat anyone.And especially if they get CoA slot. Top 5 easy on Ragnaros always without even having a great gear
---
Numbers you see don't reflect the diminishing returns.
---
I wish I knew this before I finished the quest!! On my server it’s Alliance that has the neutral cities under siege (mainly some gnome mages).
---
Damn... I wish I knew this before
---
Really? +healing effects work with the health/5 mechanic?
---
Does it have to be direct "+healing" you'd find on a green item or does it also work with general "increases healing by up to X" mechanics?
---
Do you have a source for this claim or any proof?
---
If im not mistaken, the pilot dwarf is on his own internal CD. Someone may have just spawned him and you got shoddy timing :/
---
For alliance, definitely Nethergarde Keep. 80% alliance and great community.
---
WoW would've been better with 3 factions from the start. Today I think it's way too late to make such a big change. 
---
I'd probably even go so far and say that getting rid of factions would be helpful to the game.
---
I am farming this all week.
---
Nightfin, oilys and the best are squid.
---
Wonder if mindcontrol + pulling an entire murloc camp would work and give them xp. that would be hella fun
---
I cannot chill when I am missing a motw, ask multiple times, and am staring at a full-mana druid!
---
I followed this comment chain
---
You lost the instant you replied 5 more times after the sarcastic “have a nice day!”
---
You’ve failed, pvplet. Leave my server and go to pve
---
I feel like there ought to be some kind of limit or punishment to that kind of behavior.  Killing someone you appear as a skull to for no reason other than just to do it is griefing.  There should be a limit to griefing.
---
They did answer, with silence!
---
And no, pushing a earlier release of bgs was not a answer.
---
Nor was I until this server balance 😂
---
Now I think I’m passable but that’s why I do like the imbalance a little
---
I mean, if you do literally every boss sure. But any of the different runs you do should take less than an hour.
---
Im gonna send this into the menethil boat a few times, see what happens.
---
Well which do you want, max output PvE or a good PvP warrior spec? The cookie-cutter dps MS spec would leave out imp hamstring, deflection, and piercing howl. Those last two are great all-round utility (and PvP) talents, but don't bring anything to a PvE damage build. You *could* try a Slam build (I've never tried those), but I think you'd have more fun sticking with MS.
---
dat laugh was funnier than the video itself
---
Haha same!  That smile was perfect.
---
Strange to see a Halo comment on here the day of Halo Reach's release on Steam today. The worlds are converging!
---
100% should have, the split was on the fly pretty Much, but yeah your right,
---
Queue is the answer just make both fractions equal playerslots like 5k both horde will still be asskickin cause a 60 will wait longer to play as a lvl 20 what will end in a more 60s on horde as on ally situation but it’s Atleast fair what’s fair if there are 10k playerslots on a Server and 8k of them are 1 fraction? There is no reason why it’s not already implemented ahh sry there is one reason blizzard wants ppl get rid off Classic cause shadowlands is coming and getting money just from Abo isn’t enough if this shit will go one a lot of allies will leave the game and if there are like no allies the horde will also leave ( 2h bg invite sucks so they still go into Lvling zones to do some hk‘s) well done blitz well done
---
I hope you’re fun at parties because you don’t sound fun at raids.
---
Alliance, specifically humans, have the most finished storyline. Half of the dwarves' storyline ends abruptly at the gates in southern tanaris. Gnomes are even worse, given that not even clearing Gnonemeregan gives some closure. And the night elves' storyline is heavily entangled with whatever is happening in the emerald dream, which is also not finished in classic.
---
On the horde side, I think the tauren have a more or less cohesive storyline, though it's not nearly as extensive as the human one. Orcs are unfinished to a large extent, as subsequent expansions have heavily delved into their lore. Trolls' storyline only begins quite late, but with Zul'gurub can be seen as quite a closed storyline. And the undead is an ongoing one which all sides get to enjoy up until WotLK.
---
If I had to rank them in quality and polish, I'd go Human &gt; Undead &gt; Troll &gt; Dwarves = Orc &gt; Tauren &gt; Night Elves &gt; Gnomes
---
It wasn’t once you sack of aids. The man was camping my body and /spitting like nobody’s business.
---
If you could shape up your awful English that’d be fantastic, it’s like trying to comprehend a malnourished child.
---
The people on the balanced servers and alliance dominated servers don't say that.
---
inb4 2 horde rogues gank you
---
I feel 39-49 will be more popular this time around, squat your twink at a battle master with engineering/alchemy and make the money back you spent on it transmuting on CD. Going for fire mage at 49 personally. I think getting carried will be easier than ever, most high level dungeons you will need for 39 or 49 can be duo cleared and make enough money that you could just ask to sit in there and buy drops for 50g or so.
---
Only 3 charges right?
---
I dont need to, I'm done playing BECAUSE I'm not going to no-life 15 year old content to compete with the ones that will, I just don't care enough to even bother. I have other games that I want to play and this stopped being enjoyable. I "lost" all the time I spent leveling to them, they can lose this bit to me and we'll call it even. If it makes them miss their rewards, even better.
---
Lol far but also don’t be a dick
---
Overall is harder cause aggro / using curses to buff raid/ being on  banish duty and having much weaker aoe then mages.But when it really matters on bosses warlocks really shine getting top 5 on most
---
PSA to horde from ally: I'm going to summon on of these everytime you camp the boat now
---
Not everyone pvps solely for honor or the maximizing of honor gains.
---
&gt; it's also the players fault for wanting to play a meme spec like ret
---
That's awkward. Retribution is a full talent tree with multiple options and talents that look really good on paper. Blizzard definitely intended paladins to tank or to melee dps. Problem is, it takes a while to balance a game, and Blizzard has been releasing balance patch every 2 months or so during the tenure of WoW Vanilla. We are stuck in eternal 1.12 (which is not wow vanilla) and in that particular instance Ret pally and Enhance shaman are underwhelming has both were a couple of months away to receive major rework/buff with TBC. No on is owed a raid spot of course but  we are going to disagree because I think it is unfair to blame the player that wish to play these specs.
---
What unit frame add on do you use?
---
You've been asked before I'm sure but what software, or what was used to make this?
---
Druids have a VERY high skill ceiling. The problem is, the skill FLOOR is high as well.
---
19 is most popular, definitely.
---
I was level 48 when P2 came out and for awhile, I thought the Horde were dominating the server, making the game unplayable.  Once I got to the mid-50s, I saw the truth.  I saw the horde running around in their gank squads and I saw the Alliance running around in their gank squads.  In areas like Felwood and WS, its pretty even.  I haven't been to EPL yet, cause I've heard horror stories, but I'll probably go there tonight.  Only half a level til 60!!!
---
Wonder if those Thornling Seeds also count as civilians?
---
I think the big multiboxers play retail and quickly farm gold with all their accounts then buy those things in game that give play time, so they spend gold on membership instead of their real $$
---
No way. First, the absurd part of spending the $600 per month is that it is regularly reoccurring and never gets any cheaper, nor does it ever provide any resale value. All those other things you compared it to aren't going to be regular costs each month and most of those things provide some sort of asset that could later be sold to recover some of the investment (so they aren't really pure expenses but non-liquid, depreciating assets).
---
I can see that, I guess I haven't run into any good druids.  But I main a rogue so maybe they are a hard counter, I don't know.
---
How many horde mages try to sheep me REPEATEDLY. Like you couldn't sheep me the first time (was immune) HOW MANY MORE TIMES DO YOU NEED TO TRY!?
---
Wouldn't this be abuse of game mechanics and something that is against the ToS? I see this as something along the lines of roof safe zoning.
---
i respectfully disagree.
---
imo the game is cancer when you dont play with a dedicated group, regardless of faction.
---
im alliance on a 40-60 horde server. outside of running into brm to carry one of my rl friends im having virtually none of the problems reddit describes.
---
im sure 20-80 server are an actual pain for alliance but thats not alot of realms.
---
I don’t really see how which tower it is matters. Someone who is motivated enough to get on the zep, will get on the zep. Failing that, they just camp the base of the tower. An ally mage on my server auto runs into a fence by jagged swine, pretending to be lagged out. The moment anyone attacks her, a group of rogues, druids, and hunters materializes and ganks them. Mind you, this isn’t a complaint and I think that strat is a weird mixture of hilarious, frustrating, and brilliant. I’m just pointing out that zeps are not 100% immune to problems like many people seem to suggest. 
---
Also, iirc, none of those guards are elites or 60.
---
How dare you ruin my ability to ruin your fun?
---
Ehhhh nah. Its not something id ever give you TOO MUCH shit for.. but i dont like the idea of selling highly desired pvp weapons recipies etc to the opposing faction. Id rather sell it for less and know its not being used against us.
---
It was still a single one bob that’s happened to me a dozen time 
---
It’s not my native language so what? Learning by doing bob
---
Haven't seen a queue on mankrik well... pretty much ever since a month after launch. Server's bumping though, guild's got too many people, if anything, people logging in an hour and a half late looking for a raid spot.
---
500 IQ
---
Which in average will happen because we have so little +hit on gear and no +hit in talent. That's like saying "Assuming I crit everything, I will beat everyone else in DPS"
---
I swear everyone who played back in the day got "Vengeful and Merciless Gladiator".
---
You son of a bitch. I’m in
---
That's only fair.
---
See this would just make me want to tank you twice as hard in town. I can’t be the only one
---
Forsaken have only been with Horde because it's convenient afaik.
---
Benefits from shadow weaving, so it's quite a significant damage boost.
---
Respec now and just get your gear while getting to 60
---
First if all: I'm not the OP. I'm not doing anything.
---
Second: Again the ToS very specifically addresses only SAME FACTION griefing. That's not what is happening here even IF they determine that you're giving someone DHKs on purpose.
---
Did you equip and use the ripper at all? Is your dagher skill 300?
---
1) You don't want the popular farms.
---
2) You don't want the easy brainless farms (mining / herbalism).
---
3) You don't want to respec.
---
I'd say just level an alt dedicated to farming.
---
Alliance - Gnome
---
Horde - Orc
---
Overall gnome is better because you get to play with paladins on your side.
---
We got our first 2 in 1.5 hours. 
---
Our 3rd drop took 24+ hours.
---
We were clearing entire cave efficiently enough to port up, jump down, and have first mobs start to respawn at front of cave
---
Lies
---
And then they post yesterday about how it was something different... I gave evidence that it clearly wasn't a visual bug as only 15 HKs are required for private rank.
---
We'll agree to disagree, 8 Resto shaman is bad because you still need a couple of priests and a couple of druids for brez, buffs, dispel and decurse. I'm pretty sure having 12,13 healers is worst than having an ele and enhance shaman.
---
Yea I mean looking at this guy and it's just nuts, I simply haven't run into a druid that did any of that.  This guy is crushing it.  And I simply cannot believe how many mages try and sheep druids!
---
I switched at 54 and noticed that healing became much, much easier with regards to mana efficiency. So from the perspective of allowing for faster dungeon runs where the group doesn't have to wait for the healer to drink after every pull switching earlier rather than later is probably a good idea (I healed ST both as shadow and as holy and it was night and day).  
---
But while ST is still managable as shadow, I am not sure I would want to heal BRD which in my experience was a noticeable uptick compared to earlier dungeons in terms of damage output by mobs as shadow - it might be managable  as well, I never tried though.
---
However, unless you keep points in spirit tap, which I didn't do, questing becomes much slower because I found it impossible to keep a more or less mana neutral damage rotation. So you either have to drink or wait a bit for mana to regen after fighting mobs.
---
The amount of honor it shows you in the log doesn't factor in the diminishing returns. It's just a static number based on player level and rank
---
I think the yetis only work in the three neutral towns though. Can't be summoned anywhere else. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
9 months? Ooof.
---
Our MT already has both bindings. We're time-gated by BWL now. Guess he's lucky. They dropped like 3 weeks apart from each other.
---
They do but there is not many groups.  I am trying to hit 60 so that doesnt help me if i go out and PVP. The 3 hrs I have at night are used to try and get a BRD run in lol.
---
As everyone else already mentioned.. do green quests.. greener better.. just try to avoid gray :D
---
Coo thx for the info!
---
Shes tankable in leather gear.
---
I love mine. I run an 8 button Logitech mouse. 
---
2 buttons on top - fear and howl of terror. Swap aoe in when I run dungeons.
---
Two most forward buttons on side - top is Curse of Agony. Bottom is Corruption. 
---
Two middle buttons - bottom is siphon life. Top is death coil. 
---
Two back buttons. - top is drain life. Bottom is drain soul. 
---
I then run 1-4 on the keyboard for shadow bolt, wand, immolate, and searing pain. 
---
Then hearthstone, bandage, healing pots, and mana pots are bound to ctrl + e/r/f/g 
---
Alt + e/r/f/g are engineering grenades, trinkets, and soul fire. 
---
I also run a full custom ui. Bartender to auto hide everything out of combat. Ellipsis for dot timers and cool downs. Etc...
---
It is hillarious that ive seen some posts about huge advances in cancer treatment that didnt get 5 gold but this does :D :D
---
Aye, unfortunately that is not Bigglesworth
---
I'll probably get into bgs when they come out... or try to, still a bit scarred from PVP alliance side in retail and getting curbstomped six ways from sunday.
---
I've been trying to log in more but nobody really needs healers. Have been doing alts though, but christ going through that slog again is rough.
---
yeah I'm not camping a FP but if I'm picking plants in Feralas and i see a 48 ally its dead.
---
The power of the Loa?  The light Loa.  Loa light?  That actually just sounds like diet soda.
---
Find the weapon or skill on wowhead classic by typing "wowhead classic spell" into your browser.
---
Then look closely at the info table below it called "Spell Details". For weapons with procs, you'll need to navigate from the weapon to the proc effect first.
---
If something scales with anything, it will say something like: `School Damage (Arcane)`  
---
`Value: 114 (SP mod: 0.429)`
---
Above example is Arcane Shot Rank 6. `SP mod 0.429` indicates that each point of Spell Power you have on you will increaste its damage by .429. If this tooltips says something with "weapon damage" etc, it is a physical attack and interacts with your weapon.
---
Shuuush easy mode scrub.
---
Totally agree but people will say how it’s not intended to world pvp. It is though. Personally last night we had about 30v30 in gadz. Sure it sucks to be a lowbie there, but that’s really not the 60’peoolra fault. I’m sure they’d all love to do some bgs
---
Every spec is a full talent tree, that's what a spec is. That doesn't mean all specs are good. 
---
&gt;Blizzard definitely intended paladins to tank or to melee dps.
---
Do you have a quote from an official blizzard representative, since you're using words like 'definitely' in order to lend weight to your argument?
---
&gt;No on is owed a raid spot of course but we are going to disagree because I think it is unfair to blame the player that wish to play these specs.
---
You're misunderstanding. I'm not blaming people for wanting to play ret, I'm blaming them if they feel entitled to a raid spot or to BiS loot alongside other dpsers.
---
Sounds to me like he found a pretty good pvp solution, may even be enjoying your tears.
---
Yea that’s fantastic. Will make ASAP. what’s your system for swapping and using trinkets? Do you use an auto queue with each slot on a hotkey bind? Clicking manually on trinketmenu?
---
Yes and no. You'll get tickets for Scorpid Blood too. Both is fine.
---
Oh no no no no....I “lost” to you and some other loser that probably wears a name tag at work! Go back to boat camping and have a nice day.
---
Leave my thread and go to work flipping burgers
---
Not OP but I have given world pvp a real shot. When it existed in vanilla wow. This zerg guild, 40 v few bullshit in classic is far from world pvp. Classic world pvp is the worst in the game's history.
---
...what?
---
I'm talking about how bank alts need boxes picked after the main mails it to them...and it's easier to find that lockpicking service in Org.  I'm not saying the bank alt is selling lockpick services.
---
Got a block for you to douchebag. My Reddit, my choice. I choose to eliminate idiots from my feed. Thus you are now banned, idiot. Now go wax your mom's balls bitch!
---
And we can do the same back? What’s your point?
---
You seem like someone who knows what's up. So the next time you want to teach other people about what's right and wrong, you would be a lot more helpful if you don't call other people's interpretation of numbers as nonsense. All I did was say exactly what the front page of Warcraft logs show. I don't care about the worst performing hunter/mage, nor the highest performing - in either instance, I doubt hunters/mages are the biggest offenders nor does it have anything to do with what the poster I was replying to wrote. If you know better, please enlighten me on how to read the numbers, instead of going into "I'm smarter than you"-mode.
---
What's obvious to you, might not be obvious to others and you are not the community by acting better than the average player. Might score 99s on warcraft logs, but you certainly don't in social interactions.
---
No worries!
---
Noone thought you would need fr for Rag and not clearing before sons has meant being a very low dps guild, everyone expected that already. Big difference between him doing 1k fire to a couple players every few seconds and huhuran dmg lmao
---
"MOm!"
---
Rogue vs druid usually ends up depending on if you can guess when rogue will blind and abolish poison before.
---
Venture flamelash
---
Yeah, Phase 2 is thinning out the herd and separating men from babies. It was to be expected.
---
on one hand i fucking love this because horde is dominating my server aswell (mograine eu) but on the other hand i will never cast a single multi shot again in open world pvp no way
---
G N O M E  BABY BOII
---
BUT THAT DOSSNT FIT THIS SUBS AGENDA reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
"The drums or war beat yet again" is the very first line of the intro cinematic for the game.
---
&gt; Many people spend that much and more on other hobbies/entertainment activities.
---
$7200 a year? Not really, but whatever makes you feel better.
---
You're the chosen one!
---
Honor runs at 11 est so to outside and come back in an hour
---
No you're right
---
You can close that ticket. They won't help you.
---
Its faster hit a keybind with the script in a macro than it is to right-click -&gt; Reset.
---
Seconds matter when the horde is trying to kill you outside BRD.
---
Rank 4 HT spam is very good, although HT3 is just as efficient at my plus healing (\~550) and I'm going to start spamming HT3 for raid healing more often to avoid overhealing.
---
In addition to downranking, these are things I do:
---
* Leveraging healing addons (vuhdo/healbot) to be able to see incoming heals
---
* Dropping hots on tanks, including the less efficient regrowth in rare instances (e.g. an OT is tanking two big adds and you need more consistent sustained healing)
---
* Popping mana consumes (rune/pot) early to help buffer the mana pool instead of late, on 3-4 minute fights this gives you two runes/pots per fight
---
* Self-innervate unless your best healer is significantly better than you
---
* Try to predict damage (e.g. pre-casting a heal on the living bomb target on Baron Geddon)
---
* If you're full on mana or not struggling with it, cast hots on pets to keep them alive longer (Don't do this just to pad meters, only do it if it's the RIGHT decision for the raid)
---
* When the raid takes a ton of damage and I've got mana, hitting the people that arent in the most danger with HoTs seems to work to get lots of raid healing out there (because the Shaman smart heals will hit the people in the most danger and the priests doing flash heals will too)
---
I think right now alot of my success is due to my mana efficiency though...priests and other druids are often OOM towards the latter 25% of the fight and it's usually me doing most of the healing at that point.
---
But...I want to keep growing.  I'm overhealing alot still, which is normal for druids, but something i want to avoid.  So I want to start downranking HT4 to HT 3 in raid healing top-ups to avoid this, using fewer HoTs on the raid and speeding up my predictive abilities.  I've found some interesting discussions in the Nostalrius forums, nothing groundbreaking, but interesting.
---
Possibly none as BRE is really good. But the first clear upgrade on paper is Dark Edge of Insanity. The only other ones would be Severance from Naxx (for pve and worse than Dark edge) and Might of Menethil (for pvp only).
---
However in pve weapon skill is a big deal, so it may be that already spinal reaper is better for you in pve, depends whether your axe skill can beat the massively better stats on bre.
---
If I may bring up retail (gasps from the audience) - the story of the Forsaken and their membership in the Horde is one of the best slow boil stories WoW has ever offered, all the more so because it's very open to interpretation. It really does fall upon you to decide what you think of the Forsaken. Here's my interpretation, Cole's Notes version:
---
* the Forsaken join the Horde in an alliance of convenience, because literally every other faction on Azeroth wants them dead, and Sylvanas needs allies if she's going to have a shot at killing Arthas (remember, this is her one and only goal at this point in history).
---
* the Forsaken are surprised to find that while, yes, there is suspicion and hatred from their new allies, there is also loyalty. The Tauren extend a hand and begin helping the Forsaken research the plague of undeath in hopes of curing it (this plot line was more or less abandoned in later expansions, which makes me sad).
---
* The blight is used at the Wrathgate against both the dead and the living. We don't really know how widespread the knowledge of its intended usage was. The impression I got was that only Putress and the high-ranking apothecaries were part of the coup that unleashed the blight on their allies. Sylvanas' involvement in this event is uncertain - she certainly *claims* to have had no knowledge, and I'm inclined to believe her because a) that would be a stupid as fuck thing for her to do deliberately, and b) she hadn't had her attempted suicide experience yet, which significantly affected her character.
---
* At this point, the Forsaken must have let out a collective sigh of disappointment. 'Goddamnit, this Horde thing was actually working out alright. Welp, guess, they're gonna kill us all now.' And then... they don't. The Horde retakes Undercity, kills the conspirators, positions some Kor'kron there to keep an eye on things, and... remains loyal to the Forsaken. In my opinion, this was the moment when a lot - a *lot* \- of Forsaken became 'true believers'. They took the name Forsaken because they believed that was exactly what they were - abandoned and reviled by all. Yet these allies of convenience had their back even in the wake of a terrible betrayal.
---
* Sylvanas becomes Warchief, which is just awesome for the Forsaken. She has a cult of personality about her amongst the Forsaken, AND the Forsaken are legitimately loyal to the Horde, so this is the best of all possible worlds!
---
* Aaaand then Sylvanas fucks them all over. Imagine the sheer devastation the Forsaken would feel at this. Sylvanas Windrunner - founder of the Forsaken, their beloved Dark Lady and Warchief - turns on them all. The Forsaken are forsaken once again, this time by a character who is effectively their messiah. And in the wake of these events, the Horde still. Remains. Loyal. To their allies.
---
My interpretation of the Forsaken has always been allies-of-convenience turned into truly loyal members of the Horde, because the Horde demonstrated true loyalty to *them*. At *least* twice now the Forsaken have been in a position where they could have easily expected to be wiped out by their allies for the transgressions of their leaders, and both times it hasn't happened. The vast majority of the Forsaken 'populace' are, IMHO, true believers and truly loyal to the Horde at this point.
---
The best part is that this is all my own interpretation. I could easily see you making the opposite argument and it making total sense.
---
☝️Hordie triggered we might remove his brainless farming spot
---
Hey guys, haven't played in years but found this post in /r/all  ..what are dishonorable kills? Why you people rage over it?
---
Thanks for your time, Have fun!
---
i did this a lot.
---
Everytime im bored i go to the wetland, menethl harbour as horde, and have some fun mindcontrolling alliance off the boat.
---
Never gets old, always funny. 
---
The key is dropping them far enough out in the ocean, so they die of fatique.
---
because its something different. u can have fun tryharding in either. only thing i dont like about classic: your personal performance doesnt mean shit for parsing you simply need a guild with short kill times
---
It only works in 3 hubs
---
I just hit lvl 44. I've done the main early quests in Tanaris/Desolace/Feralas/Badlands. Where should I go next? Is it too early to PuG ZF?
---
It's a bug i think, i saw it multiple times while doing pickpocket runs. If i remember correctly :  Basically i blind an NPC then use bandage. Before the blind duration is over, i gouge them. However they always had the time to give me 1 hit and that makes no sense at all.
---
I never understood this argument either, if the opposing action cares enough to kill you for honor, they’ll care enough to kill you simply because your name is red, no matter your level.
---
I was leveling my alt the other day (33 Priest, my main is a 60 raiding priest on another server) and joined an SM group. We were talking while traveling and the tank was like "I'm not prot, but this shouldn't be difficult. Just makes my job a little harder."
---
I replied "*empathizes in shadow*"
---
A dps replies "You're shadow??"
---
Yes. I'm shadow because I'm not a masochist. And I could heal in shadow all the way up to MC if I choose. Every tank and heal class can do those roles until MC. It's really not that hard.
---
Healing in shadow just feels like swimming through syrup.
---
It wasn’t because of that.
---
Honor grinding only devolves into the worst degenerating pvp just because of how it works. And that usually means being solo and corpse farming new targets ideally, and what better place than from TP to BRM. 
---
Does it take skill? no
---
Is it fun? Nope
---
Is it the most efficient and effective way to grind honor? I think so.
---
If you're in a group, whether a large group or small, you have to split your honor and all targets that your group kills will net everyone diminishing returns on honor, even if you didn't actually do any damage. So basically, being in a group hurts your honor 2 fold. 
---
If you play solo, you might not get every tag on all the enemies, but that's okay because that's more honor per kill for you plus no DR's on enemies you miss out on. Then when they corpse run and respawn, you can get full honor on an easy to kill/half dead player.
---
It's degenerate as fuck and the current pvp system is awful in design because it will always devolve to this state because of min/max.
---
I’ve seen DKP cause more drama then my LC has ever caused.

I totally get it that you would say I only like LC cuz I’m sitting on it. However we run things a bit different. The loot council is comprised of the officers plus one random raid member. I do a /roll 40, at the first boss and pull that raid member into the LC for the night. 
---
That member is allowed to provide their opinion and input about loot decisions as well as see the process of how loot is distributed. This allows for more transparency in the process. Which our guild likes.
---
The officers in the guild have actually gotten equal or less loot then their other class counterparts. I’m about the only exception, as I’m the Offtank and have gotten quite a bit of loot, because our MT is almost full BIS.
---
Overall, a loot council is only as good as the leaders running it. So if your guild leadership sucks or you don’t trust them, then your LC will flop because they will abuse the system. But if you develop a system of trust, checks, balances and transparency, you create a loot system that is so much better then DKP or free rolls.
---
This is hilarious, but also the reason why I argue with people who've thought DHK's should be counted when killing low level characters. Imagine that instead of this being an obscure quest mechanic, it's as simple as having a low level alt?
---
You cant get the mechanical yeti toy without completing the quest.
---
2v2 it can depend but 1v1 it's absolutely a mistake to sheep a druid.
---
It may be a stupid question but why not find a guild?
---
I love that hunters are expected to not roll on melee weapons as they are just "stat sticks" for us (which I agree with by the way) but then we are supposed to not roll on a legitimate upgrade to our main weapon because it is the best stat stick available to melee classes. I may not get the drop to start the Rhok quest for months since I am not available to raid every single week, but I should just refuse the second best bow in the game because eventually I have a better bow available that I may get.
---
I agree it is doable, but for the average joe, that is already a lot of commitment and time investment.
---
Actually it's a giant stick of deodorant flying in the sky.

I went to Menethil harbor 4 nights in a row.  [Same NE Hunter \(Rykinda\)](https://i.imgur.com/7yeQTvB.png) was there on the roof, abusing it every night.  Party I was with reported him, with screenshots, every night.  After a few nights in a row of this dude dropping bombs on us from the rooftop, I gave up.
---
This is on Herod.
---
Lmao I see it in work, now I see in in video games, old people stuck in old ways.
---
I was ally early K3 pre DM release, and I did fine.
---
Oh yes, of course, it's just about giving them a taste of their own medicine for a short while. It's petty but god damnit if it's not satisfying to finally have a way to "fight back".
---
Upvote - i also want to know
---
I love you
---
I miss /u/Unidan :(
---
That's what OP said.
---
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO SHARE THIS DOODE!? "hit 250 hordes"
---
Pmed
---
Thanks for the info. I’ll have to disagree with you on that last point though because it has happened to me twice. Tough for me to even believe but that’s how it went down.
---
Instead of getting mad, you got good.  Nice work.
---
feral is actually quiet good but requires a high skill cap
---
It is, my bad
---
The mental gymnastics they use to complain about it great
---
Classic wow is basically Rock Paper Scissors pvp. All about class matchups
---
&gt;Allows those hardstuck Rival players to feel good at "PvP" for once
---
Link your Gladiator account
---
As of right now the floor might be the lowest of any class to be decent in PvP as a druid. As long as you know you can shift out of roots and have moonfire on your bar you can beat any class that isn't priest or warlock.
---
Yup I know exactly what you mean. That has happened to me too when I was leveling lockpicking.
---
once bgs are available (next week), world pvp will no longer be the only way to obtain honor, and thus you will find alot less pvp happening randomly out in the world than currently.
---
Mage is amazing at farming DM trash
---
For pve it would be the opposite however right?
---
go outside? i dont think any of us here are kids who play in the backyard anymore lol
---
Yeah... I've came to the understanding. It's very viable for a rogue but a little better in the hands of a tank. Looking back on it, I shouldn't have gotten it. I was very lucky. But now that I am a tank in classic. I literally have no leg to speak in the matter saying, "Tanks should only get it" cause I had it on my rogue rofl.
---
Mirage Raceway. Just like most pve servers its slightly alliance favored (well not slightly), but it has some great horde guilds so I've enjoyed it a lot so far. Regular dungeon groups and people (nowadays mostly alts) leveling in the wild. Southshore VS TM we have to defend most of the time, but during peak hours it feels very back and forth. Later in the evening it's clearly alliance outnumbering, but with the BGs coming that's not gonna be a problem.
---
Never leveled an undead in Vanilla, eh?
---
Why did we all assume he was a Warrior... I am tanking MC with ease as a geared feral tank. The BIS tanking gear for druid is really easy to get compared to Warriors.
---
Why are stupid shit posts like this allowed. noone cares you got an AC there are alot of miners we all get them.
---
I think the stat name in the log is misleading. Your 11% "miss" rate encompassed 4 parries and 17 dodges. Not much you can do about the dodges (hover over your regular melee hits and you'll see that actual misses are categorized separately from dodges), but the parries can be eliminated by staying behind the mob you're hitting. Basically, you are comfortably above hit cap and your yellow damage isn't really "missing".
---
Sorry a bit off point, but I find it funny you repeated the incorrect name but referred to a different raid altogether. 
---
Blackwing Lair (Vanilla) 
---
Blackwing Descent (Cataclysm)
---
Probably 7 or 8 seconds. In these world pvp situations with many enemies running around I don’t wait. I vanish and get the kill as soon as possible.
---
What does future expansions have to do with classic?
---
Everything ? Classic is not a game that was meant to be stall, it was frequently updated and future expansion can be considered in order to analyse Classic designer though process. I'm obviously putting too much effort trying to convince you, I don't think you are really interested in game design. Anyway, you can look at the youtube link above if you want to hear it yourself.
---
Yeah, and he was THE infamous Angwe. Today he would be "just another rogue ganking at rogueboat".
---
My favorite was 29 and 49 as a twink rogue. 29 felt the most balanced between the classes and like you said everyone has a lot more skills and talents to play with versus 19. 
---
49 was a blast because AB became more enjoyable on mounts although my recollection is that some classes were really strong (iirc warriors and paladins).
---
How is iron foe useless? If anything it makes more sense for an undead rather an orc

A banish breaking early means that it was partially resisted. Since [Banish](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=710/banish) is a shadow type spell, you can use [Curse of Shadow](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17937/curse-of-shadow) before banishing to prevent this from happening.

&gt; I can't really seem to find any concrete information on why the Horde are bothered about killing Rag/Ony?
---
Well, Rag and Nef were trying to take control of the region, which is at odds with the goals of the Horde and Alliance. Rag wants Azeroth to burn, which is kind of problematic enough on its own. 
---
The Horde's got a big beef with Deathwing/Neltharion. He manipulated them quite a bit in the first and second wars.
---
Between the third war and through the beginning of the WoW timeline, Nefarion enslaved the Blackrock clan, formerly a part of the Horde. In the Vanilla timeline, they were threatening Thrall's leadership of the Horde.
---
Onyxia's kind of guilty by association, seeing as she's Deathwing's daughter and Nef's sister. Like them, she's got the whole world domination thing going on. The Horde doesn't really have personal beef with her from my understanding, but she inherited her daddy's issues. Onxyia may have pissed off only the Alliance, but if it weren't for them, the Horde would just be having to deal with her too.
---
i often killed mobs a few levels under me in under 20 seconds. using WW axe, even at like level 45. are you using berserker rage for increased rage generation? do you have mortal strike?
---
i normally charge in, switch to berserker stance, pop berserker rage and bloodrage, then just spam mortal strike and whirlwind (no other abilities until execute range)
---
and keep battle shout up obviously
---
This weakaura does exactly that:

Great guy back then, Good luck to you guys &lt;3 !

Well this is why I don’t run raids with pugs because of this attitude. The items for the hunter bow literally have a 100% drop rate in the sinew and 50% drop rate in the leaf. Getting this item is stupidly easy, so much that our guild is now able to sell these items to randoms because we don’t know what to do with it. While we have seen 3 strikers marks in over 2 months of raiding. People like you are blinded by an “upgrade” that will last people a couple weeks or months top before you replace that.
---
Also got 25 superior heal pots, 6 major heal pots, and 2 stacks of food on top of the usual rogue shit you get.
---
Pros are that there is 0 competition which is a biggie given the warzone that is any farm location right now, cons are its not so great in my eyes, and it's boring asf.
---
I was sub spec for extra vanish and faster stealth, used +movement speed on Nightshade boots (+1 stealth level), resists were still annoying asf.
---
They will just go out and camp nothing, because more likely than not, with the imbalance of ally to horde ratios, there wont be virtually no allys out and about in the world.
---
I´m actually more inclined to the fact of seeing alot of horde duels outside citys while waiting for bgs
---
"Not supposed to" isn't really the case. It's more like "It's more challenging to potentially deal with/avoid guard aggro." If they really didn't want you ganking in a neutral town, they would have actually stopped it back then. Just because there are guards there, doesn't mean it's forbidden. That's kind of like saying you're not supposed to kill the enemy city leaders just because they spawn guards. Not only was that possible, but it later became an achievement with a mount reward.
---
I know it’s only been a day, but how is earthshaker compared to Flamelash?
---
Who hurt you?
---
So if asmongold went into discord with a horde player and traded kills for hours, blizzard would let it happen?
---
he would but it doesn't exist
---
As is tradition. Red is dead.
---
It's like 30hp per 5 seconds. If you can't out dps that I don't know what to tell you.
---
The warrior likely abused it by equipping +heal gear, equipping the sword, then equipping his normal PvP armor.
---
I thought it would be funny to run with like 100 level 5 rogues in your group and bait the opposite faction to aoe bomb your small group.
---
No you played the Undead faction but there were Forsaken missions in the Frozen Throne campaign set after Sylvanas broke free. As Sylvanas you kill 2 of the 3 the Dreadlords that take control in Lordaeron.
---
Really the only issues with Classic come from the mega server issue. Many times the original population crammed together is what is causing the issue. The layering shit should have never been used and they should of simply created more servers and merged them as needed. (This is a problem created by Blizzard and can only be solved by Blizzard) - They should simply forcibly split a large chunk of servers because people aren't quiting in droves like they predicted since Ion and pals want this shit to fail. - People are quitting though not because of the game itself but because of queue's, and overpopulation.
---
lol i have 45 keybinds as a warlock would you mind explaining how the fuck id keybind them without modifiers? get a clue man
---
I love the contrast of the dry "what the fuck.." and that one dude with high pitched laughing the entire time lmao
---
Playing a Classic warrior is completely new to me, so I have no old ways to be stuck in. Or is this another general advice misapplied to a specific situation?
---
What is RWTing?
---
No, 44 is perfect for ZF. Stv could have some Quests left.
---
Spirit&gt;Int&gt;Stamina is for leveling. Whereas stacking as much +healing is for max level (though healing while leveling can make use of it). Damage and healing is just as strong as straight +healing when casting a healing spell, but it also applies to damage spells. The downside of it is that an item only has a limited pool of points for the itemlevel (ilvl) so if an item has +8 damage and healing it could have had something like +12 healing (numbers made up, never really looked for the ratio but it doesn't much matter).
---
Generally at max level +healing is king because it can allow you to downrank your spells to a lower rank which costs less mana but still has the same amount of +healing from your gear applied to it. There are caveats, like it must be above a level 20 spell, and the cast time would need to be the same as the max rank, for the effectiveness to remain the same. In other words downranking with +healing gear can make your lower level spells more mana efficient than your max rank. So if you need raw throughput max rank is great, and if you need to conserve mana you have those downranked spells.
---
Well, this went longer than planned, but I hope that makes sense. Feel free to reply with more questions :)
---
Oh no, a ganking piece of shit who got off on killing others trying to do quests quit the game!
---
Pretty sure that's Neatplates
---
Damn that hit home... burnt out after bwl was on farm on pserver... hope it doesn't happen again.. I really want to do nax this go round
---
So if a kid bullies because he’s bullied by his dad and his dad was bullied by his dad, etc, is he really *choosing* to be a bully? You’re oversimplifying complex behavior because you want to think you’re good and make right decisions and other people are evil and make bad decisions.
---
Happens on Fairbanks with Fury (skarmtanks streamer guild) too. Theyve been caught on video honor trading and colluding for world bosses with the same alliance guild. Nothing has happened. Not against the rules in classic apparently.
---
You lose 100 points of your current ranked points or contribution points.  For example, the number one player or bracket of players the first week of the honor system got 14,000 contribution points and go to rank 4.  For every DK they would lose about 0.75% of their total points.  
---
It comes into play a lot more when you are rank 10 going for the higher ranks.  You lose a lot of honor each week due to decay, 20%.  So, you need to maintain the top 2% of the server or higher to keep progressing upwards, otherwise your character just stagnates and never reaches higher ranks.
---
Yeah unfortunately it took us a few raids to clean it all up.
---
lol i did indeed mean pvp in which case id rather have 2x underworld band for pvp or 2x freezing band but w/e
---
I've been levelling here for about a month and I'm now level 58. Honor-update hit me as I started as I just finished my last few quests in Searing Gorge, and since then I've felt plenty activity on the world-pvp side (I die a lot, and I /clap at the 2-3 man alliance squad brave enough to gank me). I'm playing a warrior so I have little trouble finding groups for running instances, but sometimes it takes 3-4 tries to get into BRD depending on alliance's mood. 
---
I'm currently in a newly formed guild &lt;Fast Forward&gt;, merged from two different guilds Fast Forward. We got two raidteams and daily pvp-groups trying to keep things clear for a levelling scrub like myself, but I think they are doing a shit job... (read above).
---
I'm glad this server isn't bigger, or my casual ass would be too frustrated having to fight for every resource, but I still find plenty of action and people to play with. 
---
How are cities empty? When I was in Tanaris, there were constant fights around the city, and plenty of people to ask, to help out with tougher quests - I've never had issues getting a few guys together when my tough warrior levelling experience got too tough, when the normal mob was a level above me, or had a friend...
---
I think your problem is the fact that you are warlock - nobody trusts a warlock and their demon-friends. No thank you. I'd trust a rogue before a guy pulling firethrowing imps out of their asses.
---
You're a clown "I haven't complained..." Yet your whole post is a QQ.  And God damn you're annoying on top of it too.  No wonder you have groups flaming you.  You know everything, yet you really know nothing.  When given the chance to learn?  You shoot it down and say fine I'll DPS.  You're an adult baby.
---
I mean he’s right. We laugh and have fun, but rarely do we have 10 people talk at once
---
Honestly, I see it as perfectly fair. 
---
If it's going to take me forever to get these quests done, I might as well make folks regret it. Why is this yeti frustrating people a "bad" thing, yet otherwise preventing people from playing the game *at all* perfectly fine. It seems pretty hypocritical. 
---
Also my friends don't care, and, in fact, are enjoying the ability to dish out some devious suffering on them.
---
I really cannot fathom why this is seen as not fair, by any stretch. If it's fine to waste hours of my life when I'm just trying to collect fiery spider butts, it's perfectly fine to retaliate in the only way I can by ruining the progression of every aggressor. I can't do much in a 1v5, but I can make them regret it. If it's 1v1, sure, whatever. I'll try to fight normally. 
---
But in a completely no-chance 5v1, I'm dropping this yeti and I'm taking them all down with me.
---
New meta boyyyyys!
---
I feel like a
---
Sounds crazy good.  Hunters can too
---
I remember those guild names, I was alliance on Agamaggan in Vengeance and Shattered.  Small world!
---
Yes. Other players are doing this the entire time honor has been out with zeto repercussions.
---
Just farm lashers in DM:E, population shouldn't hinder farming them.
---
Not worth much, I sold mine for 35 gold. (at least on Gandling)
---
Fair enough, but it hasn't ended. There is a 2nd maintenance that hasn't started yet tho.
---
This is somewhat true but don't absolve the community, who spent every waking minute fearmongering about dead servers and perpetuating bullshit like "anybody who's anybody is on Faerlina/Herod/Gehennas!" 
---
Pserver-style mega realms were by far the preferred outcome of people on this sub. People went as far as to say no one on the medium population realms would get anything done , which was of course preposterous. 
---
I know most people here think the game is perfect and now have something to blame its decline on, but I think it was coming regardless. And when that happened, the subreddit would be filled with people complaining about dead servers and eventually perhaps losing their character name in a server merge. 
---
I'm not saying Blizzard has handled it perfectly but it's an exceptionally difficult game to keep healthy, and that's primarily the result of the design itself. 
---
The server sizes we're seeing were overwhelmingly supported by the community before P2 happened, to the extent that people were proudly sitting in or circumventing half-day queues and mocking anyone who wasn't.
---
I looked over Garr, closest to tank and spank we got
---
Looking over the logs biggest differences between your own group and you:
---
1) SnD up time Y: 82.9 Others avg 85%+
---
Review of other similar geared rogues show higher DPS for higher uptimes on SnD and lower for sub 85% uptime. 
---
This would be the biggest driver as to your lower DPS. 
---
It drives your chance for energy regen and OH procs for MH swigs. 
---
I would focus on getting this up over 85% and you should see an increase in DPS. 
---
This seems to be the biggest driver over all. 
---
You had it fall off a few times during the fight. 
---
What do you use to track it?
---
&gt;  And an enhancement shaman adds nothing a restoration shaman can't bring to the raid.
---
&gt;Enhance is not useful because of its a top-DPS class but because its a good support-dps class,
---
don't you love the internet.
---
Phase 2 isn't so much separating the men from the babies as it is separating one faction from every pvp server. As things get worse, and servers become more and more imbalanced, it doesn't prove that one group is better than than the other, it just makes the game unplayable for both sides. When pvp servers become 70/30 or worse, there is no one left to fight...men, babies, or otherwise. It is bad for the game. 
---
I agree there should be pvp servers and pve servers, that is why I make my suggestions, and they can absolutely use some tweaking. The way things are going now there will be pve servers and dead servers. I'm not saying pvp servers need to become pve servers, I'm saying they shouldn't be the free-for-all they are now unless you can find a way to balance the servers so one faction doesn't completely dominate the other. I think my suggestions (with modifications) are a better answer than what Blizz came up with in Wrath when this happened in Wintergrasp and they decided the less popular faction would get buffed... leading to unkillable Palladin super tanks and mages that could one shot 5 man groups with AOE.
---
Because positioning in this pull was definitely super important.
---
This alli to horde or horde to alli?
---
It’s fine. I’m fine with it.
---
Each DK you get stacks and takes more and morehonor the more DKs you get too
---
As someone with exams, they’re this week generally
---
you dont need shaman in the healer / caster group either.
---
You must have a really big pp
---
7 months is like half way between fall of Rome and tomorrow in the internet time. Nowadays the average life span of a thing can be counted in minutes.
---
even if that is the case, the eye version of this seems to not have this limitation
---
So what do we say if we have 4 mages equal gear and one is top 5 dps and then other 3 are 10-15? Click it faster?!
---
It's World of WARcraft. You rolled on a PvP server. What the fuck are you whining about and why the fuck are you not grouping up and raiding. All I see when horde go PvPing is alliance players (who always outnumber the horde players) just standing around mounted etc. Why not put up more of a resistance or even counterattacks?
---
Yeah but that guy also said he couldn't hang around the Frostmane NPCs for protection because they would attack him.
---
Fortunately no
---
&gt; Some of them got so pissed off that they've quit the game
---
I find this very hard to believe
---
The point OP is making that people do not understand due to a poor alert/tooltip built into the game, is that you do not need everyone out of the instance at the time the party leader clicks the "reset all instances" button.  Having all five people out at the same time is harder to time, meaning your party is outside longer waiting for the 5th person to leave the instance, and more susceptible to getting instance camped/ganked.  If you realize the point being made everyone in the party can minimize time stepping out then back in.  You can just step out then immediately in, no need to have a careful coordination of everyone, just make sure only ONE person is in charge of reset, and that should be party lead to avoid confusion IMO.
---
It wasn't a retcon. Sylvannas spent over a decade building up trust with the Horde before her ultimate betrayal. Further, the loa of death conspired to convince Vul'jin via a series of visions that Sylvannas was the best successor.
---
I honestly hate saying it but it is true, BC is WAY better at literally everything than Classic. I don't understand why more people didn't ask for that over Classic....
---
And your comment wasn't shit talking? holy shit entitled little kid in the house. 
---
Whats up brother how are you? 
---
Enjoying phase 2? 
---
Getting camped? 
---
Must be since you are so negative lmao cringe amirite
---
Good job these players have quit the game sounds like they would be toxic if they get that salty over something like that. Just go pvp elsewhere outside of a town ?
---
Even though you robbed him 14 years ago I can't help but think about how amazing of a moment this is. If you think about it, its kinda nuts lol. Out of all the servers you two could've chose you chose the same one and out of all the names he could've had hes still using the same one.
---
Shoulder chest and gloves you could upgrade in 5 mans but yeh you can do Mc as an OT or even MT for a newer guild.
---
Horde pp very smol
---
Our guild always take a couple lowbies if they’re leveling in guild :)
---
You're fine, you're over thinking it :D
---
a sad lad salad
---
Tanks have trouble finding a guild in general since you only need two, and dps can just equip shields to off tank if needed. I had the same issue on retail
---
It's more the idiocy of anyone you're grouped with. It's also potentially hundreds of hours of work "PvP"ing and a permanent black stain on your honour page.
---
Pretty great trolling honestly.
---
Are there any good specs for tanking and BGs for warriors? Looking to change off my leveling specs and focus on tanking for dungeons, but I'd also love to do BGs when they release.
---
Are you forgetting tokens? The accounts pay for themselves.
---
stop ur gonna expose my secrets
---
What Shoulders chest and gloves should I be going for next? I started stacking mats for Chromatic but I doubt the carapace will ever drop. Is Valor chest better than my current? It’s rotting in my bank currently
---
Even the top pushers are only rank 6 atm. A dozen dhk currently means relativly little compared to getting a single dhk at rank 13. 
---
They will recover, this might put them 1 week behind schedule if they are planning on pushing for high rank right away. Wich ofc is truly horrible for them, but not something they cant recover from.
---
Thanks for your honor.
---
I'm sure these players dont plan to continue this when bgs come out. There really isnt a good way to grind honor right now. They are probably trying to get every little bit they can so they can be a little bit ahead when bgs come out.
---
The yeti's name? Albert Einstein.
---
Exactly.
---
That means the top chose the Presence Of Mind Talent and the others did not
---
I have had that issue in the past as well you can always join as the guy that tanks a ton of 5 mans builds relationships and becomes the next man up.
---
Could be I just had a bad group then, we wiped a couple of times and couldn't handle the lizard boss at all.  I was 45 had a 46 ret pally, the rest of the group was 43-44.
---
any1 know exactly how many rating points is lost per dhk?
---
Eh I consider the pummelers the bare minimum. Druid dps is pretty bad without pummelers.
---
He will get banned, might even get his honor adjusted. 
---
I promise you he will get banned, just keep reporting.
---
Skeram is fine tho.  I wouldn't want it any other way as an Alliance player.
---
True, this post seems more like a cope thread/venting thread.
---
The thing is that the faction that is ganking is holding these cities with raids of people and just killing any random person that walks inside.. 
---
So to give them a few Dishonorable kills for being so cruel seems like a proper thing to do.
---
Because Vanilla had class balance every 2 months?
---
I just picked this quest up last night! I know what I'm doing later...
---
But our faction isnt falling apart. There isnt 100s of alliance leaving like everyone says. This is just you making it more dramatic than it is.
---
This is the macro you wanna use for fixing the issue with powershifting found on https://discord.gg/yCYfsk3 Druid classic discord.

I made the mistake of rolling pvp due to coworkers being there. They dont play anymore and my life at 60 during p2 isn't as fun. I don't complain, but truthfully I'm not a PvP type of person. 
---
I don't regret playing pve now. I miss my 60 and only raid log these days but it's been fun on pve so far and will really be more fun when I can enjoy the difference that pve affords you later on for sure (I'm only 20 so far and haven't been to so many contested zones yet).

There's not a single Q in my entire post. I haven't had any groups flame me. I know some stuff (like how to stance dance), and I don't know other stuff (like how to let someone else have the last word). When given the chance to learn, I learn. But can one learn something one already knows? "Adult baby" is an oxymoron.
---
As an alliance on same server i feel the opposite \^\^ always some undead mage to target me from safe spots
---
If that’s how you’re going to run it, nobody should be using Thunderfury in your raid because it eats two debuff slots, one of which makes the tank generate less rage/second.
---
Just find ouro in searing gorge he’ll have 3-4 rogues with him. You’ll know it’s him bc he farms 1v5 for hours, but when 10 gang up to kill him he cries about how it’s not balanced and the irony isn’t lost on him :)
---
You overwhelmed with early release of battlegrounds now? You holding up okay?
---
The people getting wound up by this guy (Read: You) either haven't checked his profile history, or don't know how to deal with trolls.
---
I recommend you downvote and move on.  Don't feed the trolls.
---
after 3 dks, you get your license suspended for 3 months. 5 dks and you're looking at criminal charges
---
you sure as hell seems to have a problem with common sense man.
---
asking 'source' every 5 words doesn't help you.
---
Had to google. Have not played regularly since wotlk.
---
Isn't working as of a couple days ago. I did it for one of my characters 3? weeks ago. Tried doing a few days ago for a friend and it wouldn't release the name.
---
I'd also check out Shedo druid. very comprehensive guide on being feral cat dps:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9a-DLHmtFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9a-DLHmtFI)
---
I feel the same way, but I also am still having trouble holding aggro etc in 5 mans so I’m wondering if something is missing or if it’s literally just my shitty mechanics. (Or impatient dps)
---
Swords are prio to rogues because fuck undead/troll warriors right? I'm saying swords have no appropriate home because no Horde racial provides +swords. Orc warriors get prio on Deathbringer, the rest of the weps are circumstancial. Were you dropped on the head or were you born like this?
---
Windfurry....lul
---
i hope the ganking doesn't stop after BGs are released
---
cope harder
---
We are getting close to the point where the casuals are hitting 60 and the hard core players have alts at 60. Pretty soon, guilds will be building new raid groups with these new bodies and you can just position yourself in there. I know my guild is already planning a split to 2 separate raid groups as we now have enough geared, attuned 60s to run two full teams with just a handful of Pug members in each. Talk to a guild you like and see if they are willing to promise you a tank spot on the next wave of groups.
---
As someone who hates gankers of any faction this brimgs me great joy
---
No. Escape.
---
If you have skinning, turtles at Tanaris south coast (where you do the Map quest)
---
Lonely zone (no quest other than the Map one there), so you'll probably be alone. 
---
Thick and Rugged Leather (Mobs lvl 48-50). Turtle Scales too (vendors for 1s/ea, on AH they sell for like 7-10s/ea)
---
Chance for Golden Pearl (40g), probably you'll get 1 every 2 hours.
---
Do your tanks have fire resistance gear and are they using juju embers?
---
Looks like he needs a windfury crit or a reckoning bomb
---
you cant use it in BRM
---
I mostly rolled rp-pve for the short login queue at launch, but not regretting it! I love duelling and pvp, but only when both teams agree? In Southshore we have daily horde vs alliance raid with everyone pvp enabled.
---
Ofcourse sometimes i wish i was on a PvP server, but with BG's coming i have all the pvp action i desire
---
Why would he sell healing lots and blinding powder as a rogue? We use that shit constantly.
---
I've made 15g an hour fishing in Bay of Storms for Winter Squid, which go for 30s each on my server.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I was never able to get 90 gold before level 40. 
---
But note that gold from quests 40+ really ramps up. You’ll definitely have enough by 41-42 or so.
---
Antu'sul is rough for any group honestly, best strat with a lower level group is to burst the boss and pray. Maybe skip him entirely if no one needs his shit. I'm not sure what the strat is supposed to be since he regularly stuns the tank for several seconds, lol. I think it can be dispelled by a priest though.
---
Stupid people often blame others for their mistakes. It’s the mark of a true idiot.
---
Alas I am a troll, and am at 6% with the gear listed, so do I need edgemasters or something? Or just those boots
---
Awesome reply thank you so much.
---
I think for PvE you have to get into some deep maths between Crusader/Crusader vs +5/Crusader (as far as I'm aware you always want Crusader OH).
---
Seeing as it's a pain to have diff enchants for pvp and pve, I think most people will atick with +5/Crusader.
---
Vendor trash is enough to get mount gold before 41. Just be a little frugal with upgrading abilities that you don't need, or that don't get a lot more useful with upgrades.
---
omegalul
---
Just wait until people learn that you can use mind control to grief people using this item exploit. Maybe then people will wake up and realize that exploits of any kind are bad &amp; should be fixed.
---
Everywhere is a pvp zone. Everywhere.
---
Except that the best non-dagger spec is hemo, so you wouldn't be getting any of the weapons specializations.
---
Classic wow isn't balanced.
---
The only answer to this question is 1 tank, enough shaman healers to keep him alive, and every other group being fully composed of fury warriors and a shaman for windfury. Nothing beats a fury warrior for dps in classic, especially with cooldowns. He would be dead in about 30 seconds even if you didn't have any raid gear on any of the warriors.
---
I agree with this. These deathsquads going around and killing everything that moves just hurts the server as a whole. I get it, but at the end of the day if this doesn't stop, people will leave ASAP once server transfers become available and no one wants that.
---
That's not what I want. I want world PvP. I just want consequences for someone who thinks it's fun to gank and camp someone 10 levels lower than them. If I didn't want PvP at all, I'd be advocating for PvP flags or moving to a pve server. Practice some reading comprehension, man. 
---
You are also wrong about retail. They did not apply this there. War mode is different because it basically shards you away from other PvP players.
---
It's really good on rogues and fury warriors since it's one handed from the start instead of main hand as it was for the most of vanilla. But of course there's no way they could use it without the MT having one, well maybe a rogue could with vanish but a fury would be threat capped.
---
And yet it will still massively out dps a ret paladin.
---
Even non min maxing tryhard guilds are going to put the Enhance Shamans in melee groups. Meme still applies.
---
For the Alliance!
---
Yeah Oct 14th. When you said your first MC was. Which you presumably maintanked at 60, right?
---
I think the culprit may be gouge. It seems like a buggy skill and I’ve had mobs attack me in between a blind and gouge. Usually it happens when I’m fighting mobs and I need to blind one. Instead of vanishing and opening with cheap shot, this is what happens:  
---
Blind, bandage, gouge, take a hit from the mob, then i start attacking as soon as gouge is up. How I’m taking a hit in between the gouge and blind is strange.  
---
I also noticed yesterday when fighting yeti’s that freeze me, if I was spamming an attack and the mob froze me I would still get a hit off even tho I was frozen. It’s super close in timing but it is definitely off. Almost seems like server lag or something. I have a great connection and this stuff happens all the time still.
---
the problem in vanilla is there's much, much less leather tanking gear compared to a warriors plate tanking gear. 
---
for example: in the Molten Core warriors have an entire 8-piece armor set completely dedicated to tanking https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=209
---
the 8-piece armor set for druids on the other hand is not suited for tanking, it's more of a healing/boomkin hybrid thing https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=205
---
so your gearing revolves around non-set leather pieces, which there aren't a lot of in the raiding content right now. the only ones i can think of are Fireguard Shoulders &amp; Wristguards of Stability, all other armor pieces come from elsewhere
---
(crafted/dungeons/pvp/etc). 
---
this does get better in the later raids though with much more leather variety. but then another problem is the majority of guilds only take 1 feral druid due to their limited viability, so it's tough to find a raid spot.
---
Sell it now to buy later. Duh! /s
---
And this, I also enjoy RP [https://i.imgur.com/ODvWu8z.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ODvWu8z.jpg)
---
On PVE servers it has been great! TM vs SS has been a blast when the sides both had numbers. When you're done, unflag and go to dungeons or raids without fear of getting ganked! PVE Server FTW!
---
Key board turning. Complaining about guard behavior when you’re getting 1v2’d. Plays with his camera like a total mongoloid. Shitty tiktok meme on top of it all. Yup. That’s a horde player.
---
Tell that to Blizzard, they still haven't fixed rooftop camping. They should either make those areas literally unaccessible or perma ban for it, period.
---
I'm not sure why they continue now last time I logged I was the only Alliance in either Burning Steppes or searing gorge. Occasionally there would be a 60 Ally, but they'd quickly disappear. SW had ~20 people. 
---
I was on Stalagg, one of the highest pop servers, and the alliance playerbase is gone. What's there left to farm?
---
Honestly the biggest problem for Ret Paladins is that Holy Paladins are so damn good at healing that they aren’t hit by the tax of being the support class.
---
This item is only usable in a few cities it sounds like
---
FYI I “tank” her every week phase 3 intro. I’m a lock in bis so it’s a lot of greens with no stats besides shadow spell power. I can tank her a lot longer than I’d ever think viable. Usually I end up getting her, then tank pulls her off me.
---
Definitely looking forward to Twinking. I’ll stay in the 19 bracket, gearing out a Druid.
---
If your on bigglesworth Horde, I’ll loan you the money. At 43+ quests pay stupid amounts and u get gold really quick.
---
Loot everything off mob and vendor the gray items and stuff you dont need
---
My fights start pretty much the same, then a raid of horde roll in and stomp me lol.
---
If your horde look up the lobster quest in desolace.
---
Personally, I'm going to spawn this item every time I'm in BRM. Every time I see a large group of horde, I'm going to spam this item. I think it's great that theres now a way to penalize these people. Their "hard work" shouldn't be respected really, they're inconveniencing other players all day everyday. I love pvping, but there's nothing laudable about honor grinding now. You're literally ruining other people's experience for gear in one sided death balls. Yeah, it's just the way the game is right now, but do you really expect people to have any respect for your honor grind at this point? If people can undo hours or even days of your honorgrind, I think they SHOULD right now. If enough people do it, it might even stabilize the open world because the horde will be afraid to go out and PvP in raids because theyll get DHKs. This honor grind is directly affecting the long-term health of the Game. If this is a way to discourage it, then why shouldn't people do it until.BGs come out?
---
Because min/maxing a 15 year old game is SO vital. You are talking about 5% of the playerbase. It's funny how there are no differences between serious guilds and "non-serious" guilds. People are still clearing all raid bosses in 1.5-2.5 hours.
---
That's what I said for pvp, off this was a joke (duh)
---
You will earn a lot more gold per level after 40 than you did before 40. Just keep leveling naturally  and by level 42 you'll have enough. Keep selling skins and ore on the AH or to vendors if your server economy is too saturated. You'll get there.
---
"So dumb how the guard keeps spawning"
---
Whoah... It's almost like Blizzard wanted to deter people from camping the boats.
---
No tank can hold agro on every single minion in a dungeon, any dps can and will overagro something once in awhile
---
You on Herod? I sound like that one warrior.
---
yeah... either that or the common knowledge that paladin have a tree called protection, are can tank 5 man, are 100% viable tank in the next expansion...
---
but yeah, it would be totally unreasonable to make any assumption without  a blue quote saying so! cause we're on the internet and winning arguments matter more than using basic common sense.
---
Honestly, i'd go with valor shoulders over the stoneforms. Your weakest in the threat dept right now, so the extra AP + slight bit of extra rage will help. Chest go with kromkrush or deathbone, gloves you can get death grips (great for mobs w/ disarm), deathbone, or razor gloves.
---
That said, your gear is fine for raiding now. You can get even better upgrades in raid, but still have motivation to keep farming 5mans for ups during your lockouts.
---
10/10 best post on here today.
---
I do some small multiboxing (just three accounts), and I definitely get mixed reactions. Some people hate it, but they are very much a loud minority. I find somewhat more people think it is neat or looks cool. And then of course the majority just don't care.
---
&gt; But while ST is still managable as shadow, I am not sure I would want to heal BRD - which in my experience was a noticeable uptick compared to earlier dungeons in terms of damage output by mobs - that way - it might be managable as well, I never tried though.
---
BRD as a full clear is quite possible with blue/green gear at level 52 if you know how to spec and know your healing.
---
I'd definitely recommend practicing in ST if you haven't healed extensively as a priest while leveling; learning the ins and outs and how to time big casts versus mana conserve - these are all "the zen of healing" things you need to know before attempting BRD.
---
I leveled as holy, so doing my first full clear at 52 was rough, but not impossible.
---
Name one thing that she did to build trust with the horde, all she has done is chase personal vendettas and strengthen the forsaken.
---
Do you have a +1% Hit weapon?
---
So long as you have 9% total, you should be OK
---
#nochanges hasn’t existed since day one when they allowed way more people per server than existed in vanilla.  That creates the need for layering and the disaster that is p2 from a camping every possible location standpoint.
---
World PvP wasn’t like this in vanilla and yet you basically have the same time period between wpvp and BGs as then.  Should have been simultaneously as you stated.  You would have thought they learned from that.  The only defense is that you did have some people who remembered wpvp fondly.  I believe that those people had some very selective editing in their minds on the whole experience though they existed non the less.
---
Mining. I'm at level 34 sitting on 100g already. Charred vale in stone talon is good for mithril.
---
It means "second to last in a series of things" as in "the penultimate chapter of a book" or "the penultimate step in the instructions." It doesn't mean "second best" or "second worst."
---
If you have a good heal rotation that fits in with your current amount of mana, +healing, and spirit to allow for minimum downtime while keeping everyone alive, you could stay shadow until 60. I did, because I was spending a lot of time questing and grinding until 60. 
---
However, if you want to level primarily through instances then switching to holy or disc would be beneficial. The last instance I healed as shadow was a Strat Live run that got pretty hairy due to a lackluster group that was doing big pulls with minimal attention paid to threat; the first instance I healed as holy was a Scholo run with two meme spec DPS classes (boomkin and shadow priest) and the difference in how easy it was to me was vast. 
---
Make the decision based on how you want to finish out your leveling and how efficient you are at healing currently.
---
It's a 2h sword.
---
I made an alt on a pve server. Pvp is not at all what I remember of the fun engaging world battles. It is now just a mob mentality grind fest where people are mobs. I have had probably less than 5 encounters in the world with the opposite faction that were reminiscent of what pvp was like years ago. Most of the time it is either landing at a fp getting killed over and over or crossing a zone line and getting killed over and over. Rarely is there ever another player just roaming that we engage in combat it is mostly just huge mobs of decked out players steam rolling everyone.
---
You're replying to a chain about an item that can be used *anywhere*, including BGs.  This isn't the same thing the OP is talking about.
---
Ooooh... Its a 'type' in the gay community.
---
Thanks for confirming my thoughts :)
---
Well they should certainly be considered in your profit. On my server Major Healing pots are 1g a piece.
---
Miss read your ring and hands. 
---
You should be g2g!  Again the giants at the start are your gear check. If they squish you, use an armor elixir and you should be good!
---
Good ones are hard to replace.
---
As a troll your hit% cap is 9% unless you are using an item that gives you + weapon skill, which you aren't currently. The most important stat for any warrior is getting weapon skill to 305 or higher. Usually done with edgemasters, though there are other options that aren't so expensive. After that you want to be at the new 6% hit cap. Then you either gear for threat (+crit items, items with a lot of agi) or mitigation (stamina and armor are better than defense rating) depending on what the raid needs from you.
---
That my friend is how you make even the most mentally fit person to snap and be committed to an insane asylum, haha.
---
&gt;are 100% viable tank in the next expansion...
---
not really.
---
&gt;cause we're on the internet and winning arguments matter more than using basic common sense.
---
like I said, if asking for a source about game design gets you so worked up, then you're the one with no common sense.
---
*Point to the tank going to aggro a pull when everyone is drinking* :(
---
Great stuff, grief those horde
---
/L2read.....
---
Ty for your patience. 🤣
---
You beautiful crazy son of a bitch.
---
|This isn't a couple of hours wasted, this is hundreds of hours wasted throughout the raid. 
---
***I see this as an absolute win.***
---
Also *both* sides could do it. Yes. Both sides could also be aware of this. Thing is, I'm certain the group running in to do MC doesn't care too much about their rank either, while the folks locking down BRM do. Or even if it's fighting between two groups heading to MC, again, I doubt neither care that much about their rank in that case.. (additionally, neither raid would be planning on outright camping the other so this feels like a disingenuous comparison when the main source of agony are the folks, again, not letting others play the game. Two raids running into MC and clashing eventually results on everyone going to their destination anyway.)
---
 If anything, I see this as escalating to a point where folks just don't hold the mountain down on such massive scales for fear of this VERY loss of hundreds of hours of gameplay.
---
Doesn't account for the aggro reduction mechanics so it's not reliable
---
400-500 dollars a month is a bit pricey, but not some crazy high amount for your only hobby.
---
What is the addon that shows Vendor, Auction, and Disenchant?
---
Where is it at?
---
Horde or Aly?
---
That's so silly who even cares about hp pool past 7k in Molten Core
---
No changes muahahaha
---
I mean yeah what you said sounds very reasonable.
---
The initial rush was fun, alliance showed off their bigger brains using terrain and coordination to their advantage. It really felt like a world war and it was not guaranteed that our 10 man crew would succeed anywhere. Routinely we would get out played by a clearly more coordinated group, sometimes our sheer zerg overcame them and their raid would do a coordinated port. The rush for ranking to get the pvp trinket was very strong. Now 3 weeks in, its clearly not worth it. If even 10% of the temporarily quitting players dont return, thats really sad.
---
Yaaa BRD is borderline unplayable these days if your server is lopsided. =/ good luck out there.
---
Why are alliance players here so fckin salty? The clip was funny. Thats it.
---
Dude was salty long before getting thrown into sea water and dying to fatigue.
---
This man plays.
---
I rerolled PVE after
---
starting on Faerlina.  the ganking was always bad but once phase II started it was unplayable for me. If I'm lucky I can play for a few hours most days.  Sometime not all at once either.  So between the 2+ hour queue times when layers went away and the constant being ganked by level 60s no mater where I tried to quest I had enough.
---
Nw I play on a PVE server and guess what?  If I want to take part in the faction vs. faction pvp going on in Hillsbrad, I can flag pvp and go do that.  When I get tired of that and want to level up my level 30 alt, I can log them on, go to the exact same zone and not have to deal with it.
---
The only thing different on PVP realms is that assholes have free reign to explore and enjoy the depths of their assholeness.  Bullies can bully to their heart's content with no one there to make them reign it in.  As long as they are abiding by the game rules or at least not breaking them too flagrantly they can grief all day long as much as they want.
---
And really, that's it.  Unless you like never being allowed to do anything outside of instnaces past level 25 without some asshole getting to decide that 'no, actually you won't be doing what you wanted to do' then there isn't a reason to be on a PVP server.
---
If you like world PVP and want to do that you can flag for it on any realm.  You just can't turn the flag off in PVP.
---
wrong. Mind controlling a player and having that player kill a civilian will grant the dishonorable kill to the priest using mind control.
---
Yeah, I always kinda wondered where that Tauren plotline would go. Personally, how would you have taken it if you were to write it?
---
It's not about the events of BfA, it's about the new plague being developed and Varimathras's betrayal: the events that are going to unfold in WotLK at Wrathgate.
---
A better love story than Twilight.
---
Our server still has queues during peak hours and our guild has a morning and evening raid team.
---
And there's no competing with shamans, who can use farsight/waterwalking to check all the spawns and run there faster than anyone else.
---
even for swords? I thought that +5 in fast weapon would be better, and crusader for the slowest one for more procs.
---
I gave mine away. 30'sh gold seems reasonable though.
---
good one... like one willing to spam wingclip in order to benefit the raid?
---
So you think they willfully ducked it up?
---
neat
---
What the fuck? Do not listen to this guy. Just recast banish and also use curse of shadows before since you’re so worried about it resisting. I’ve never ever had an issue. I even use rank 1 on this fight and manage to be up there in parses casting it twice or so on my designated add.
---
even illidan was tanked by a prot paladin in TBC.
---
but keep going. it's not like your opinion matter.
---
Why grief people?
---
Any game that has sandbox qualities are all slave labor.
---
but you'd buy them otherwise, so it's effectively gold you make
---
And those people are welcome to continue playing Vanilla Classic. Hope Blizz ignores those people when the time comes.
---
WoW vanilla had a lot of things "killing" the servers as in something which people didn't like at all, just like you don't like some things.
---
People expressed their opinions like you have expressed yours and Blizzard listened and fixed it. There was a cycle of complaints and fixes, complaints and fixes. Would you like to check the result for yourself?
---
Heyy... fuck YOU
---
What are you talking about? I never ganked or harassed anyone. I’m talking about OP doing it.
---
Engineering dummies?
---
time to login and drop some yetis everywhere!!!!
---
You would think this, but on my server if you’re even in the same zone as some of these monkeys pushing R14 they scream at you for being an honor leech and to leave their zone.
---
Someone is mad they aint invited to the PvP Group
---
Lol you're either on a joke of a server or there's 5 shamans camping 24/7 using farsight, ghost form, and water walking. 5-10 waters in half an hour is absolutely laughable, even IF you are a shaman, due to PvP and other fishers. That's why you're getting downvoted.
---
OP is literally griefing the opposite faction, yet I wonder if the subreddit is going to condem this? Are people going to turn around and cry endlessly about mindcontrol duel 'exploit', roof camping, etc?
---
Elvui map with Deja mini map
---
Between doing solo jump runs (kill bosses with my shaman, loot with my rogue) and BRD pick pocketing runs, I'm nearly done with the mats for my invulnerable mail.
---
I would highly suggest if you have a rogue alt, make it sub to pick pocket faster and easier.
---
The real story here is this:
---
Buffs (world buffs) on hunter pets tick down while offline/dismissed.
---
YET THIS FEAR DONT?!?1
---
I mean often did this happen before honor compared to after? What changed?
---
So glad I havent finished the quest!
---
Salty dad needs to get good and stop whining or reroll PvE. I get you cant even fight a 1vs20, but thats what you signed up for, maybe you gotta do something else that night. Your time constraint isnt anybody else’s concern. The only shitty thing here is you blaming others for enjoying their favorite game...
---
Yeah, I'm sick of people writing their thoughts on a public forum for discussion.   
---
It's super annoying because I select new and click and read every single post, instead of selecting hot to see what the community thinks is most valuable and filtering out the content I don't want to see.
---
You are 100% wrong in thinking people doing MC don't care about rank. The best pvp gear right now is mostly from MC/Ony, and most people raiding are doing it to get that gear for that reason. I'm sorry but you are obviously ignorant on how this will go down and how shit actually works. So, you are mad about your couple of hours getting wasted, but, if everyones hours gets wasted in the game, thats okay? I wasn't even talking about someone holding down BRM, I was talking about two guilds who happen to be heading to raid at the same time and clash going in, and that happens all the time. What you are suggesting is because of this, they all should be punished. You are just going deep into super petty levels.
---
I think you are right, you don't need a shaman in every group. It's all abut making decision, and you might want to sacrifice a bit of dps to increase the number of buffs you have, as I said  you can either run raid with multiple parties without totems or have an elemental and and enhance to give totem buffs to more raid members.  Having an ele shaman/Boomkin in your mage group is exactly doing this, dropping dps to gain utility.
---
Since when is dicking over a bunch of horde a sin? That's gods work my friend.
---
A Lannister plays his best.
---
&gt;Spending a few hundred bucks a month on a hobby is pretty common among middle class people.
---
You should probably take a look at what you consider "middle class" if you think $600/month on hobbies is common among them.
---
In case anyone doesn't know, these "gank squads" will also use detect magic so they can indeed see the honorless buff anyways
---
clever girl!!!!
---
P3 NO ONE should dps until the tank picks up agro and give him a while to maintain threat. Fireballs fuck with the threat table a lot so it’s safer to have the tank smack her for like 20-30sec before anyone starts DPSing
---
This will be downvoted because people don't want to know they're the problem.
---
Projection
---
And they are having a hard time on rag?
---
If the ranged keep dying they aren't using prot pots.  Melee dying is on the "get out calls"
---
Tanks dying would be healers.
---
In vanilla you could watch the nodes in AB from the lumberyard cliff. I seriously doubt this will be doable in classic. The draw distance in vanilla was nowhere near as bad and I used a crappy dell with integrated graphics.
---
In terms of story, theres not much reason to go into MC except for the sake of either altruism or wealth and glory. While Ragnaros serves the old gods with the ultimate endgame of enslaving Azeroth, Rag lies dormant and isnt really doing much except warring against Nefarian and the Blackrock Orcs, a common enemy of the Horde and Alliance. Theres no real pressing reason to go into MC.
---
Onyxia is more the lore boss. Alliance want her dead for manipulating them. Horde have more loose reasoning. The Orcs want to either stamp out or absorb the Blackrock Orcs, because a fractitious Horde is a challenge to Thralls authority. Rend is the initial goal, but since killing him doesnt deal with the problem, they realize they also have to break the Black Dragonflights control over the Blackrock orcs.
---
For the other raids, it goes a bit downhill. NEs want to finish their war against the Qiraji... the rest of the races dont really have a reason other then the "theyre a threat to is all" excuse. 
---
For Naxx, Sylvannas is vengeaful and the Humans want the scourge gone for all yhe death theyve caused them.
---
ZG, none, same old, Hakkar is a threat to us all story. You might think trolls, but most of the Horde trolls are from the islands and dont have that much to do with the Jungle trolls, though they probably are more informed about Hakkar than the other races.
---
mindcontrol duel to remove honorless \#nochanges! xD
---
roofcamping \#nochanges! xD
---
Deep Arms Warrior is one of the strongest classes in PvP because Mortal Strike is just that powerful. Any other spec, even with the best gear in the game, is mediocre or weak for PvP. No guild is going to let you raid as Arms for long after MC, though. It sounds like PvP isn't as important to you, so, if you have to pick one to sit, it would probably be deep Fury, but no Warrior spec will make you actually good at both sides of the game.
---
&gt; You're saying one very specific thing.
---
... Am I? Alliance have crazy benefits in PvE raids from Paladins, dwarf racials, and human racials. That doesn't seem "very" specific.
---
&gt; I'm talking about quest zones
---
Horde get SM and RFK/RFD and better access to STV. Everything else is about par. Questing is a very short part of the game in general though, especially in specific zones (pro tip, you can very easily skip STV).
---
&gt; flight path locations, how much you have to travel between zones
---
Thorium Point is the best flight path to BRM, and IF is a stone's throw away from both TP and Menethil which then further gives you quick access to north and central points in the Western Kingdom. The only worse flight path that Alliance have for end-game raiding and dungeons is Onyxia, but Theramore really isn't that much further away. On top of that, Alliance have that crazy tram thing which translates into insanely fast travel between SW and IF. Horde have no equivalent to that. One of the biggest differences that I noticed switching to Alliance is that travel to the vast majority of places and to all of the high-traffic areas is insanely trivial for Alliance.
---
&gt; You're not wrong, but I'd say some horde racials are kinda op too if you really want to get into it. Will of the forsaken and orc stun resist off the top of my head.
---
WotF is decent from time to time, but having a tank immune to fear by rotating Fear Ward is invaluable by comparison. Orc stun resist is useless in raids.
---
&gt; Arent Paladins like the least played class anyway?
---
No, not by a long shot. If you count for faction population and exclusivity, they are far more popular than Shamans. At least, according to the last census I saw, but it should be noted that good census data is very hard to find. Druid is by far the least played class, but with BGs coming that may change.
---
That's wrong though
---
Expansions for the modern game are planned nearly 2 expacs in advance. Shadowlands work started when Legion launched according to Dev Q&amp;As. Work already has started on 10.0 and the idea for 11.0 is already on the table
---
I was about to start reading and...... deleted
---
Thanks for the analysis, I really appreciate it.
---
Could you clarify one point for me as I am not familiar with that mechanic:
---
 It drives your chance for energy regen and OH procs for MH swigs.
---
I always thought energy is a fixed 20 energy per 2 seconds? How can attack speed affect my energy regeneration?
---
In what way does the OH affect the MH?
---
Did you actually expect a 15 year old game to be the way it was 15 years ago? We're not stupid anymore, and we know the game, ofcourse it wasn't going to be the same...
---
r/Earthfury
---
Just not engaging in combat makes you yield no honor
---
Of the herbs you get before 40, only one, swiftthistle, sells very well. On a pserver, I paid for my mount farming swiftthistle. But honestly, if you don't have herbalism already, you'll probably get your mount money quicker by just questing and levelling normally, being conservative about what spells you buy, and not buying stuff on the AH.
---
bagnon, it's awesome
---
ElvUI+ wuf is what you see. I can post a list if you'd like
---
&gt;Because camping brm and fighting 20 v 1 just isn't fun no matter how you look at it,
---
Yes it is. I enjoy it. I also enjoy getting hunted and coming back to find them
---
&gt; and if you do take pleasure from that you're pathetic.
---
Lol. This statement right here. I'm playing a video game as designed.
---
What's pathetic is choosing pvp then actually complaining about it.
---
You're free to pve.
---
Troll for style points.
---
I wouldnt bother with that gold/h
---
So anyway I started mind blasting
---
I just hit 60 with my paladin who is currently 16/0/35. So partially holy and mostly ret.
---
I was wondering what the best holy spec for level 60 dungeons is (i just healed stratholme pretty well as a ret with healing gear but want to do better).
---
I also want to know what the best talent options for pvp if I chose to go that route. Thanks for the help!
---
Both of you need to be popping rage pots and Shield Slamming her and etc at the end of P2 before she starts come down (go under he and jump), and all your DPS needs to stop dots and stop DPS ***COMPLETELY***, we do this and it's always worked fine, even low-manning. 
---
Fury tanking is also OP here, I've stayed deep Prot but our other tank rips threat so hard nobody has a chance when he goes Fury Prot...does like 5th-7th damage as well.
---
Text removed!! Flair?
---
"faith" ... let's hope he does his exam well and doesn't end up like the messenger 😁
---
How can he have a screenshot of something that never happened?
---
Rooftop campers are reportable.  I''ve seen GMs come in and personally remove them.  Tell them not to go back up there.
---
Exactly, there are tons of ways to make up for it without rage quitting over a couple dks. Death threats are a bit much.
---
Noggenfogger EU was even an gnome :)
---
Excuse me what
---
What about Bonesnapper? It looks like it'd be good for a mace rogue but Thrashblade is super similar with a much better proc. I don't really pvp and have never twinked, so I really don't know much here.
---
All these pictures and doesnt show us where he is on the map?
---
You're gonna have to go into the Warrior disc (Fight Club I think its called) and do some theorycrafting on the spreadsheets that exist.
---
I know as an enhance bro, the +5 axes from the orc racial is an absolutely insane increase in DPS because of the reduced damage penalty on glancing blows.  I still think that the BRE armor penetration proc is better, but I'm not entirely sure for how long.
---
A little while ago I bound pet aggro to shift+mouse scroll up and pet de-aggro to shift+mouse scroll down based on the recommendations of people on this sub and IT’S WONDERFUL!
---
I highly recommend it to anyone with a pet. I haven’t hit 60 on my lock alt yet but it’s been proving super useful for micro-managing my succubus and getting max value/spacing out of my encounters with nyc mobs
---
You only yield honor if you engage in combat.  Just keep running
---
If you join as fury but volunteer to offtank encounters that need it, tank 5mans all the time in guild, spend dkp on those might drops the other fury warriors ignore, and just maintain a good set of tank gear, you've got a good chance of moving to a tank slot when one opens up, either because someone quits or you split off a second raid group or whatever.
---
Lol please, you cant roll a pvp server and then cry when it takes an hour to get into brm. Its all part of it, nobody can fight a 1vs20 but maybe you gotta do something else that night. Get good isnt always a skill thing, maybe you have to be good enough to realize when you shouldnt run to DM upon seeing a raid block the chokepoint in. The only assholes are the ones whining. Parts of this game suck, especially on pvp servers, so reroll PvE or get good
---
all of these census websites show different info and I do not trust them.   OP said 7 alliance guilds switched and it is just not true.
---
Yup, that's why I switched to fury and now top the chart. If you're nt the first in the guild you're not the main tank.
---
Also I'm salty when we keep adding tanks to the guild. But on the other hand, most guys who only tank aren't actually skilled enough to swap roles, so I find fury to be fun. And I still off tank often, and tank dungeons.
---
Will low pop factions even be able to participate in DMF? It seems like it will be camped just like FP's
---
This is the most alliance thing i have ever seen
---
I see, Im kinda noobish in checking these logs currently as its basically my first one, so I didnt really figure out how to separate parries and dodges yet.
---
Guess its just the parries (my own fault) that screwed me over, as the dodges would be in line with the other rogues. Looks like its not just rng and i can improve :)
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Just PvP better bro?
---
everybody wanted to be hard and roll pvp now look at you. lol just kidding I roll pvp too but am 100% making a pve alt for... pve!
---
Shadow mastery gives 10% shad dmg increase.
---
Demonic Sacrifice succubus gives 15% shad dmg increase. 
---
If you are looking to max dps in pve you need Ruin and Demonic Sacrifice. If youre not pve’ing however take nightfall and siphon life etc.
---
since trinkets can't be swapped infight I simply click them (from an action bar ofc not from the bags) mh/oh switch is done with macros on mousewheel up and down
---
Someone quit Ragnarok Online back in the day because I got a new hat that they wanted. People are crazy.
---
Check youtube.  Is video proof of GMs forcing people off rooftops and telling them to stop it.  It's not allowed to bug the guards out because they can't get up there.
---
Thats how you do it! No whining! Vengeance!!!!
---
No ones mad that people kill low levels... people are annoyed that pussy ass horde get like 5 level 60s and invade level 20 towns then pretend like theyre bad ass
---
Woh is that how you spell blamo?
---
If you enter an enemy player's combat log range (about 50 yards) with the aura on, you won't automatically show. But if you add or remove an aura while in that detection range, you will show up on Spy.
---
The comments are funnier than “shadow priest Mind Control off boat video #3729.”
---
Lol I was going to say that xD
---
I keep most of mine as well. I would just include their auction amount to give a better idea of total value gained over the whole hour.  The potions probably put it closer to 40g total depending on server prices.
---
Can you heal?
---
I have a 96% parse on gar, using void just helped me learn the fight in the beginning
---
Really nice art. Great work!
---
which seven guilds transferred?
---
We never even split it with 40....just have everyone stand on the left side.
---
Nah, mages will nova blink and then die. 
---
Rogues with double improved sprint / evasion are way better
---
I'd guess he was trying to post something on reddit and not look for a job, but what do I know.
---
Lucifron, Gehennas, Shazz (decursing) and Domo (poly) are dragging mages down. Hunters only fight where they have duties other than DPS is Magmadar. On Golem and Rag where both classes can just stand and pewpew mages clearly win out.
---
Because it isn't
---
 SL/Ruin vs SL/NF opinions?
---
But I was under the impression that DK's don't matter at all, that they have no effect on your honor or rank. Am I wrong?
---
You need to read more of the thread.
---
BGs being released early. there you fucking go. you ppl are just relentlessly stupid.
---
Correct. But if you’re doing the GUID trick and intercept&gt;taunting, melee should be fairly ok as well. Might get one or two one shots if the tank pickup is slow but the guys that aren’t on the bottom 3 GUID list can all go crazy.
---
I'd suggest something with a mix of Holy and Ret, I'm partial to this build for something that can do both Heal and Damage:  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/50503101501--05230351200315  
---
The main (kind of important) draw back is the 5% crit on Holy Spells you're losing, but that is something I personally am willing to give up for a more flexible spec. Holy Shock is not an extremely useful healing tool so not going 31 points into Holy won't be a big deal. The talents in the Protection tree (mostly Blessing of Kings, Guardian's Favor, and Improved Righteous Fury) have some uses, but you'll lose a lot of talent points investing there.
---
If MT was your goal you probably had to tryhard it to 60 to get the gear before most of the other warrior tanks.  Otherwise your best bet is to pug it and wait for your guild to start alt runs.
---
im horde on a realm that is as far as im aware pretty close to 50/50 (maybe 60/40 horde favored) and leveling in the 40s+ was miserable. every single leveling zone had flight points or main quest hubs camped by alliance.
---
we are lucky though in that there are actual battles for control over BRM. it seems like alliance always controls DM but horde is able to take BRM for about half the day, but when they dont control it its another 10+ corpse runs.
---
I personally use the F# keys
---
it's probably easier and cheaper on blizz staff, if people stopped attacking when they see a yeti in the 3 locations they really shouldnt lol.
---
Owl
---
This wouldn't work without the Spell Power though, OP is a fresh 60, also the post just got removed as I'm typing this. &gt;&gt;
---
Wolves are great! If you really like one, when you get lvl 19 head over to SFK and train the Slavering Worg. It's a Wolf with 1.2 attack speed which is the best a wolf can get!
---
get the xbow from strat ud. youre welcome
---
Hmm. Still not seeing a problem here.
---
You act like I'm the only person being camped. The only one who is paying $15 a month for my main to have a black and white screen and I have to hope to GOD that there's help around for me to get anything done, and Incendius only only favors Horde 45:55 or something like that, and I have friends on here so I don't plan on leaving. God forbid I was on some hellhole like Stalagg, though.
---
I'd like to clear up one thing.
---
I'm not mad. I'm exhausted and happy to find a way to level the playing field in a manner of speaking. I'm certain others feel the same way. I would be lying if I didn't agree that it was petty, sure. Even trollish, but not invalid. Are the folks ganking in cities not trolling? The gank squads making just farming mats impossible.  
---
And finally, remember that it's just a game. Now folks on the losing faction have a chance to play and have some fun of their own after "being" the fun for another. 
---
Oh, and PS. What's wrong with this being a risk worth considering in PvP? On a mass scale, it seems like it could drive up the market for target dummies and their mats, make engineering a bit more profitable, and even create some tense standoffs where folks take a calculated risk as to whether or not their "meat" that they are eyeing is tainted.
---
In my experience there aren't too many people farming. Maybe it depends on what you're farming but I think everyone on my server has made their money and most of the good farming spots are only mildly contested. Haven't had any issues questing on my alts. Seems like people are less friendly leveling now but it might be my imagination.
---
I wouldn't doubt it. They have been homogenizing the game slowly since TBC. First they take away faction specific classes (pally/shamans), slim talent trees, started giving everyone bloodlust type spells to make them feel special, everyone started getting some type of self-heal, and now everyone's abilities are based on a combo-point type system.
---
Pls don't snort the coffee. Brew it first.
---
Lmfao this comment
---
Engineering BoPs require engineering.
---
We had a priest tank for an almost laughable amount of time on our last attempt.
---
It's a burst dot that can crit but can't be used on players, that's about it. It's a flavor spell and yes the doomguard can be enslaved.
---
It was an island off the coast of  STV that was only present in WoW Alpha. 
---
Hayven has a video on it which you can see here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMOUiy1uwX0&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMOUiy1uwX0&amp;)
---
I'm referring to small scale skirmishes not large scale battles like Hillsbrad. 
---
But thanks for your very thorough and valuable input to the discussion ....
---
The ratio is definitely not that on Atiesh. It's really hard to say what it currently is because there are so many rerollers coming over. When I was leveling my Alliance alts, I saw tons of Horde also leveling. Probably an even ratio with a slight advantage to Horde. Our SS and TM battles are constantly packed. Sometimes the Horde dominate, sometimes the Alliance.
---
I love this server and how popular it is becoming.
---
I'm interested in getting the AV Exalted Wolf. I currently have both Warlock mounts. Does this give me 75/150 riding skill respectively? 
---
Will I still need to pay for the riding skill when I go for my AV mount?
---
There seems to be mixed answers on this and would just like some clarification. 
---
I think you guys are really overblowing it, any hardcore guild has multiple raid teams and people with multiple alts that raid in different groups, I dont see how having a mage would be a detriment to his attempts to become a tank. Not to mention, any half decent warrior especially a tank needs another toon to farm gold since warrior gold farming is quite pathetic, and mage is one of the better choices to do so.
---
But pvp then?No threat to worry about :-)
---
Or, you know, pay attention to the thing you’re responsible for while dpsing and be far enough away from the add to rebanish if it breaks early.
---
While I hate what the game has become in BFA, a fantastic argument can be made the the results were amazing. A decade and a half later, WoW is still one of the top games on the planet despite huge changes in the gaming world. The art style is dated. The gameplay is dated. The technology is limited. Dozen of other games have come into the market, dominated, and left, yet WoW keeps kicking. By any standard, it has been a huge success.
---
.........
---
We have different expectations from vanilla, you expected something like CSGO, Overwatch and Fortnite style PvP and I expected classic style PvP.
---
There is no right or wrong type of PvP, you got what you expected but in no way can you blame others which expected the classic experience, that is just not OK.
---
Not sure about MC, but in Ony yes. Saw her drop two of the same helmet.
---
All well and good but the Garr fight often has lots of placement issues.  The move speed debuff is part of it, spreading tanks out so that the AOE doesn't impact each other, ranged and healers staying in range.  During progression it's impossible to keep everything in a neat and tidy package.  Banished adds WILL pop out occasionally and might get a hit or two in because they move 50%+ faster than any of the nearby healers.  As a healer you sometimes just have to be in range of an add if it moves some random way and you don't have room in your rotation to spend 5-10 seconds moving because of your reduced move speed.
---
As a Paladin this opens up the bubble -&gt; dishonorable kill mechanic
---
Put me in the screenshot
---
That's the problem though, looking at the spreadsheet, that means that after I hit 250 healing, Heal 1 will be my most efficient spell and I don't know if throwing out 550 hp heals will be enough.
---
oh yeah. really worked up over it. completely mad about it. you couldn't believe how mad I am right now... at you mildly entertaining me between 2 compilations.
---
The honor they gain by running around in gank squads is negligible. If it's their sole honor gain they will not meet the minimums to rank up and probably lose more honor to decay than what they gain.
---
Rank 7 were talking a 25k minium in CP. How do you get that when each kill gives you 5-10 cp.
---
We love em too! Shout out to my boy Happles trying to gank AFK people in IF.
---
That's why i said focus on spell power lol
---
 /r/nothingeverhappens
---
What is a progression guild, and how is that different from a normal guild? Don't all guilds make progress?
---
How can I be wrong when I never made a statement about either side? Read carefully bud.
---
Rogues should be defending or positioning to attack the efc, not running the flag
---
The yeti is good period. He helped me solo a few hard elites for quests including that gark lorkrub escort.
---
Rerolled pve but still logs into raid, according to post
---
I understand that people can do it without being punished. I'm aware it is not enforced well.
---
I'm saying if it was 100% apparent collusion and being broadcasted to a large audience, blizzard would take action. That's what I believe would happen
---
Guys guys, watch this:
---
TAIWAN NUMBA WAN

FREE HONG KONG

FREE TIBET
---
REDDIT OWNED BY WINNIE THE POOH LOL
---
One of you picking tailoring and enchanting is probably the way to go. You'll be able to make bags for each other, and taking any greed-won greens and blues during dungeons for your disenchanting will keep you stocked on essences/dusts/shards for future enchantment.
---
They are best at giving honor.
---
Can't summon on the boat.
---
Crying like a little girl, Yup. That's an Alliance player.
---
Hence the low drop chance
---
Being bothered by people using reddit to make complaint posts is also pretty myopic. People have been griping about literally anything &amp; everything on this site for longer than most of us have been playing WoW in any form.
---
Yea when I think about profit made i would include price of pots because major is 1.25g and sup is .3-.4 a piece on my server. Blinding powder/fadeleaf is also pricy right now due to pvp. Also pyro/plugger kills can make a difference in gph depending on gear/success rate. Furthermore, using sprint in certain areas to save a vanish/prep and also utilizing certain safe spots like window can make a difference too.
---
I would go herb/alchemy for nice handy potions.
---
Never apologize to gnome. Even I dont like em
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-paladin-class-overview
---
All the basic and advanced information you might need is in that guide. Personal choices may of course slightly differ from the recommended builds, but its mostly accurate.
---
Don’t you start at the absolute bottom of rep with them (hated) if you havent done anything for them yet? So in that case it would not decrease. 
---
Its impossible to lvl up atm except for in BRD. I am lvl 53 and that was my last resort: farm them because no one really goes there.
---
Daily, I'm pretty sure.
---
no this will create isolation in a mmo, which is bad cause look at retail, just a singleplayer where u use other people as bots to farm for u.
---
Very big thanks, that was what i was looking for, awesome. 
---
Where and how can i find out how much for example; +10 healing gear is compared to stats? So i know when regular gear is better than +healing gear? If you know what i mean..
---
Progression guild is a guild that does not have current content on farm, so maybe they are still struggling with MC for example.
---
Ok boomer.
---
&gt;Orcs are unfinished to a large extent, as subsequent expansions have heavily delved into their lore.
---
Yet we still have a demon worshipping cult inside of Orgrimmar...
---
Wasn't Thrall planning something against Neeru? He kinda forgot.
---
Imagine having to play 14 hours a day for 7 days to get standing #1 bracket 14 and during a shatter someone drops a target dummy, eye of killrog from strat or a yeti that is limited to one of the towns.   
---
It's horrible for both sides and will bring some huge issues with it during the bg's phase. It's one way to kill this game I suppose.
---
Maybe. But I’ve done my part trying to motivate IF dwellers and they’d rather log in and do nothing. I’m not ranking so I got my trinket and PvP once in a while for fun, but not going to bother in prime.  While you bring up a good point, I think the actual REAL problem is flight path and boat camping on these new megaservers - whereas it wouldn’t be as bad of a problem on original WoW servers.
---
And that makes you superior, and gives you purpose in life. And you are good, the best, the most o yeaaa, mhmmm yeaaa
---
Wolves are a good pet. For leveling it doesn’t matter too much especially if it’s only pve. They have middle of the road stats making them a good all around pet. If you’re not min/maxing then pick whatever looks cool to you!
---
Done. Ironic calling me a disease when you have herpes from sucking your mom's balls.
---
Big F for The Brave Ones. Thanks mate, hope your doing fine yourself :)
---
I did try that spec, and it can make a pretty big difference, but I just found to only prolong the inevitable. I also run into the same issue of running out if mana. NS + Healing touch is like a third of my mana. 
---
With that spec, I would basically go full cat bleeds, pop NS HT (if low) moonfire, insect swarm, and go into bear for charge. Most fights though, it would come down to me simply not having the mana to keep up. Most classes have a second wind or a way to reset the fight in some capacity. Also, Shifting out of forms and rej 3-4 times, as well other spells and abilities completely annihilates my mana pool within 15-20 seconds of the fight.
---
Probably having first aid would help a lot. I am sure there are ways to improve, but it just seems like an incredibly challenging thing to do for someone who is fairly casual player. A lot of my organic pvp fights end with me just out mana, sitting in my normal form with half health, blissfully unaware that I did not have enough mana to shift out, cast a spell, and shift back in. I even run 30+ intel with my feral pvp set, but it’s just not enough.
---
Tailoring is usually picked by locks, mages or priest because of the epic BoP craft at (300). I would recommend you or your friend to go herb+alch, that way in groups you have both a herber and a miner (good in mauradon, dire maul).
---
I agree with everything you said, but why stop there? PVP should just be something you can turn on and off. That way you can walk around safely everywhere unless you KNOW you're gonna win the fight. Why PVP if there's a chance you will lose?
---
Also you aren't going far enough with the negative honor. People should also get negative honor for being mean to me and not inviting me to their MC raid.
---
I literally cannot even go to Orgrimmar on my paladin without a bunch of mean griefers attacking me. Please Blizz, this is getting out of control.
---
Funny how people will cry about an exploit that affects them, then promote exploits that dont.
---
I know you understand it's not just complaining about pvp on a pvp server. Don't be so disingenuous. You gotta have a least a tiny bit of empathy to the frustration caused by **constant** boat camps. Getting MCd off that far out is a dick move probably thrown on a pile of other inconvenience caused by griefing horde. It's not the individual acts of pvp. It's not that that this priest was on the boat. It's this on top of everything else caused by overpopulation.
---
Oooh will poke you ingame to see it live :)
---
Yeah, but this as well won't apply to the rerelease of BWL etc in classic. People will already know the best strats and builds. It won't be nearly as hard as people make it seem.
---
Herod-Horde checking in - getting ganked in UC and Orgrimmar. Not salty, actually love it. Ganking happens to both factions, chill out and learn that while it may be a minor inconvienance, it's not the end of the world and doesn't really affect your life in any substantial way.
---
Try the macro where you can use health pots in bear form
---
Lore is full of plot holea.Just like Illidan went mad for no reason and everyone wants him dead to suddenly Kael going mad also and summoning demons the ones he fought against...
---
XD
---
You are so pathetic it's funny
---
Some may have stayed but some definitely transferred.
---
This post is like winning the lottery, but you have to wait a week to get your money. So instead you throw your current money at those *get rich quick* schemes because you're impatient.
---
As others said, just let your leadership know you’d like to tank if the opportunity presents itself. Our guild just called up a tank who did exactly that when an offtank quit, and now he’s the #2 tank and got hooked up with like 5 tank pieces in MC this week. Just took several weeks of patiently doing mediocre fury dps lol
---
Not this early on. Op needs to provide proof or hes lying.
---
Will it be able to Tank Decently since ill be Solo LvLing or will I be Reviving constantly? Assuming im doing my Job correctly keeping it fed and mended properly.
---
wow toxic.
---
Destroying weeks of progress is not griefing? imagine being able to rip someones tier sets from their corpse with some weird item no one has thought off, you would also fully support that?
---
Aw yeah man. Thos gon be a shitshow. 🤣
---
Something else must have been going on then. This guy was healing like 10% of his health bar every few globals. It wasn't a slow gradual increase it was lots of sharp bursts of health. Maybe he had lots of ranks of healthstones in his bag or something... I'd never seen anything like it before so when I inspected him and saw the sword I assumed that must have been it.
---
Food for thoughts.
---
Make all NPCs that are suitable "dishonorable kill".
---
Really? I had no idea about this. That’s pretty cool.
---
Ah ok so you're the MT and GL who doesn't tank the raids. Got it.
---
Listen, if you wanna call yourself casual? Non-addicted? on a self-admitted 30hour/week gameplay schedule (200h in 7weeks, just to clarify the math for you), be my guest. The rest of us will be over here in reality.
---
As I just said, you need edgemasters or core leather gloves if you want to keep up wtih threat.
---
Ironfoe only benefits from human racial.
---
DHKs are no where near as bad as people think.
---
The way the honor system works is you get kills which grant you honor. This honor is ranked, weekly, against other people on your server gaining honor. Once everyone is ranked by honor, they are broken into 14 groups, with the fewest in the top group, and the most in the top group. Each group receives a different amount of *ranking points*, with the top groups receiving the most, but ultimately individual rank matters (top rank gets the most *ranking points than everyone*). 
---
Then your rank is determined by how many ranking points you have, with 60,000 ranking points required for Rank 14.
---
What a DHK does is an immediate -100 *ranking points*, nothing else.
---
&gt;Why isn't this bad for non-hardcore rankers?
---
Each week there is a 20% decay to your ranking points which massively outweighs DHKs. For example:
---
Say you are Rank 5 which means you have somewhere between 15k to 20k ranking points. Lets use 18k for our example. This means you will lose 3.6k of ranking points simply due to time passing. This is the equivalent to 36 DHKs.
---
Now lets say you got enough honor during the week to rank middle of the pack for your server. This means you'll gain 5k ranking points.
---
In a scenario where you have 0 DHKs, you will end up with (18k - 3.6k + 5k) 19.4k ranking points.
---
In a scenario where you have 1 DHK, you will end up with (18k - 3.6k + 5k - 0.1k) 19.3k ranking points.
---
So as you can see in this scenario, the DHK isn't affection your ranking points that much, it's how many ranking points you gained vs you lost in decay for the week.
---
&gt;Why is this bad for hard-core rankers?
---
To reach rank 14 you need 60k ranking point. If you are #1 for honor on your server during the week, you earn the maximum ranking points of 13k.
---
Now when you start getting close to 60k ranking points, say 50k+, your total decay a week is between 10-12k. This means that if you are #1 on your server, you are gaining a max of 1-3k ranking points, earning less the closer you get to 60k points (or if you fall from #1 on your server for a week).
---
This means that each -100 starts taking away a greater proportion of your total ranking points earned per week as you start hitting the higher levels.
---
But where this really translates into an issue, is if a DHK would push your total honor gained for the week just below the threshold of Rank 14, you now have to spend *another full week* grinding 18 hours a day to gain the ranking points to hit rank 14. So 1 DHK could be enough to make you grind for an entire extra week. Multiple DHK could mean months+ of extra grinding if you're not #1 in honor each week because the ranking points you gain each week and the ranking points you lose due to decay each week start to become very close to the same number.
---
suck a fat one
---
What about resummoning a pet with geddon bomb in the AH?
---
It's been explained elsewhere though, part of Sylvanas' backstory shows the Night Elves sending support to the Alliance during the Second War, ultimately battling the Horde together during the burning of Quel'Thalas.
---
So it's not completely without explanation, but yeah, it would have been nice to have some indication of their inclusion and role within the Alliance in-game.
---
i’m not a guild leader? lmfao when did I ever say I was? 
---
the only reality you live on is the same one that dude was in was in who saying that dumb shit earlier. no accountability, (and you still can’t read)
---
And lose my Troll bow racial, forcing me to gimp myself to hit 9% hit instead of 6%. No thanks. It is a BOW. It is the main weapon for a hunter. It is a stat stick for anyone else. If this were a sword or mace with +hit and agility, people would lose their minds if a hunter rolled on it even if it is best in slot for them based on the logic "it is my BIS and you have other weapons available to you later so long as you get to and kill the last boss in the raid".
---
Gnomish Death Ray and the Gnomish Battle Chicken are the two that everyone makes. Most of the others require Gnomish engineering to use, but those two just require Gnomish engineering to craft them.
---
This is a pretty good analogy
---
There are a few weakauras that do this in game as well (e.g.  [https://wago.io/OXlZupyKm](https://wago.io/OXlZupyKm) ).
---
Wowdownrank will give you further option to focus on whether you want efficiency per mana or per second as a higher priority.
---
I find that depending on the team composition and pug/guild runs i'm in more need or one than the other so set up both cases and work out the rythm of the group after a few pulls
---
stonetalon is the best place.  Thats where i gank on my 19 ally char.  I would say every 3rd person i see is a mounted horde ganking lowbies.  So dont feel bad for them.....
---
After reading so much whining on this sub I wanted to see this with my own eyes so I jumped on my 48 lvl alliance warlock and oh my phase 2 is so much FUN. No one behave like pussy anymore, people 10 level lower than me just rush and want to KoS, Tanaris, STV and other zones are just warzones everyone kill everything. Before phase 2 I felt ashamed when I wanted to duel someone, DoT him up and he didnt even fight back that's the worst feel in the world, but when someone jump on you while you mind your own business and you win this fight this is the reason why I play on PvP server. I had many 2vs1and even 3vs1 fights which I won. Ofc I'm dying a lot too when some sneaky rogue get behind me while I have 10% HP left but its part of the game.
---
Noooo. My dreams. 😭
---
&gt;I am a tank but there are no raid spots available!
---
That's been sort of rewritten.
---
A major point of Sylvanas' backstory involves her interaction with the Alliance during the Second War.
---
No you didnt do the math. It will not coat you crit. Pants + shoulders + feet will never be 2.9% crit.
---
I played, as Ally, on a PvP server. I started during BC. 
---
My friends were all playing Ally on Mal’Ganis. So that’s what I did too. I made a Dwarf Warrior.
---
What I didn’t know was that Mal’Ganis was a PvP server and, if I remember correctly, it was like 70/30 Horde to Ally. Might have been worse. This made us all hardened PvPers who /hated/ Horde with a passion and would kill on sight. Any level, didn’t matter. Even joking about making a Horde alt would lead to relentless ballbusting and accusations of traitor. 
---
I quit during Mists, but I played for years through some serious PvP bullshit. I hit Outlands just as Death Knights dropped. Dealt with Horde raiding SW daily. Got into huge WPvP guild fights with Goon Squad, the leading Horde guild on the server. Basically a lot of shit very similar to what’s going on in Classic now.
---
This time around once again I originally followed my friends, but we rolled PvE this time. This was a decision of contention among our group, some felt it was wimping out while others just wanted to avoid ganking. We don’t have the time to play that we used to. 
---
Once again I rolled Dwarf Warrior for Arms PvP, hoping to hit 60 before BG’s dropped. My friends rolled pocket healers like they used to as well. Life was good and nostalgia was sweet. 
---
I hit 50 just as everyone else lost interest and fizzled out around mid-40’s. One by one my friends quit. 
---
So there I was, worst leveling class in the game, worst 1v1 class in the game, looking at an honor grind without pocket heals, on a PvE server. 
---
Another friend tried to convince me to re-roll Ally on a different PvP server. “Faction imbalances aren’t as bad anymore” he claimed. “You won’t find bullshit like on Mal’Ganis” 
---
I didn’t believe him. I never wanted to deal with that level on imbalance and ganking ever again. I wouldn’t risk it. So instead, I completely re-rolled Horde on a Horde-dominant PvP server. Went from PvE Dwarf Warrior to PvP Undead Priest. 
---
It turns out, I did actually miss PvP - but only the good parts. I didn’t miss playing a class that can’t really win a 1v1 if they get the jump on you. I didn’t miss being the minority faction. I didn’t miss being spawn camped mercilessly. I didn’t miss being free honor kills to any Mage that saw me. 
---
I did it different this time, played a class that’s decent against almost anything else 1v1, and joined the majority faction on a PvP server. Some may claim that playing the underdog faction makes you better, but really I don’t think that’s true. It’s kind of just wasting your time as you struggle to survive just to quest. It doesn’t make your character better or tougher. It may hone your skills but those can only take you so far. 
---
It’s so much goddamn easier this way and I’m having much more fun. I kind of wish I had rolled Horde from the beginning, and picked what I wanted instead of following my friends. 
---
Tl;dr: As a former PvP player who rolled PvE then switched back - I only missed the good parts of PvP. And those good parts come around much more often if you roll with the majority instead of being some kind of contrarian. A man has an opinion.
---
Ion pretty much said the factions are staying, even throwing out that tired cliche about it being the “World of WARcraft.” Which pretty much killed any interest I had in Shadowlands. You can expect some stupid faction war to flare up, again, sometime between now and release that will force the Pretty Boys to fight the Ugly D00dz over some mystical macguffin which will Decide The Fate Of The Universe! before being sacrificed in some stupid ploy to defeat/free the Big Bad who will summarily be written off within a patch or so.
---
I guess you support removing the extra gadgetzan guards then?
---
I play on sulfuras and it is BOOOOOOOMING!  During peak times we will have a short 15min que but the world and cities are full.
---
I like the second one :-D
---
It’s not the fastest. You want to do dungeons a lot for the gear, quest XP that will speed your questing up a lot. Warriors need gear. Get them gear in dungeons and solo play is fast and easy.
---
Was the pull probably fucked from the get-go? Sure. But the positioning of OP pretty much guaranteed the wipe. Even if a pull starts wonky, you should always try to do your tasks properly, every experienced raider will tell you that. Sometimes the wonky pull ends up in a kill, saving you and your raid tons of time. It's not like what he did was hard to avoid either, the tanks had her in the right position.
---
Just brutal here kek
---
Yes, I was being a dork.
---
I haven't played since 8.2.  Can you explain to me what changed Dishonourable Kills have changed that would cause someone to quit the game?
---
The Darkmoon Faire is in uncontested zones, so when it’s in your faction’s zone you’ll probably be fine as long as you’re not flagged.
---
Use Mirahs Song in OH with QS for fury tanking. The dal rend OH is pretty crap by itself.
---
It's faster to cast than regrowth or HT. Chain sheeping prevents you from healing.
---
I also direct my allies use it to bait a shift so I can Hibernate :).
---
I only use flash heal in the raid when I'm assigned to raid heal, if I'm on a tank renew / heal / greater heal, sometimes shield and flash if the tank takes a beating.
---
You also want to bind a key for dispell of you don't already :)
---
Pretty sure you start as Hostile, and can go a long way further down from there if you start killing them.
---
How expensive is "of frozen wrath" gear? Like the pre-bis stuff? How much should I expect to drop?
---
&gt;\#nochanges, except the changes I like 
---
Your position is as solid as your cellulite asscheeks.
---
Batching is unbelievably dumb and I don't know why it's still a thing in its current iteration. Anyone who plays a rogue or druid can tell you that, more often than not, even opening from stealth with a successful cheapshot or pounce (I assume it happens as regularly for pounce as well) results in you stunning a mob as expected, while taking a melee attack from the mob. I mean like 80+% of the time I cheapshot a mob, it somehow starts the fight with an auto attack on me while stunned.
---
Why wouldn't you listen to that guy, it's very good advice, especially for people newer to the fight who aren't killing garr in 40 seconds.  Blueberry still builds aggro on banished targets, it gives you a nice buffer.
---
Haha I had a similar struggle. Ironfoe dropped for me and next run I got the quel serrar book from DM. Luckily the book dropped second and I thought it was a pretty easy choice to sell for 800g instead. As far as ironfoe goes, I specced dual wield fury after getting it and I usually push 350 dps with all blues and 6 percent hit. So it's pretty damn good.
---
YoU’rE sO bAd At pVP
---
I love how you clicked your bandage, you're so bad.
---
I'm not complaining oh ye of little brain. 
---
It is possible to have an opinion on something without being emotionally invested. I know Reddit struggles with this concept incredibly. 
---
Tell me exactly, how does not being interested in camping flight paths like a loser make someone a "pleb"? You can call me a pleb again after I've been smashing you in Battlegrounds.
---
Neither is rooftop camping or mind control honorless-wiping.
---
sunwell is actually in the game, maybe you have trouble understanding basic logic.
---
look up hotw/ns, it's a great feral pvp spec
---
Efficient is not the correct word here.
---
Most healers run severely downranked versions of each spell and keep max rank versions available on demand.  Its not uncommon to see heals for 500-700 in a raid environment as you just cannot sustain larger heals in longer fights.  Its important to note, you wont be solo raid healing the tanks and everyone else.  its a multi-person job.
---
Nobody is refuting the claim of it giving people dhks. We're talking about people supposedly quitting.
---
trading you for the 10 people that quit because of this grieffest would be a good trade
---
What do you mean "they overpopulate the servers"? It was the community who overpopulated servers, Blizzard told you not to do it in the first place. No one forced you to create your char there, no one prisoned your char there in the first place, you were able to transfer out if your server was overpopulated. 
---
If anything, shitstorm of phase 2 was predicted and obvious: if it's not for you, you should have been rolling PVE  from the start.
---
Progression generally means still learning/clearing bosses. A "normal" guild, if such a thing exists, would be clearing 10/10 right now. 
---
Most established guilds at this point will be 10/10. Most newer guilds will be progression guilds. It's generally easier to find a spot in progression guilds, as they're also normally working on their roster at the same time. 
---
In later content, progression guilds will become the norm, rather than exception, due to the increase in difficulty and time commitment.
---
I do play on a PvE server, so swing and a miss my dude.
---
So basically you are raid logging as the people on PvP servers?
---
How are you dying on the Zep?  It's not a contested zone, and neither is tirisfal?  Or are you going to gRom gol?
---
what's a compilation? You're not even making sense now.
---
Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!!!
---
#exceptthechangesilike
---
I think this is a pretty bad mindset. The people that rushed to 60 are either the vanilla extremists that returned to do it again or have been playing pservers for over a decade and just now what to do. 
---
There is a large portion of the game slowly working their way to 60 still and just because they haven't made it, doesn't mean they are scrubs. Just means they haven't redone the content every time a pserver closed/opened. 
---
Progression at this point will be rough for these guilds but that's what some of us want. Doesn't make anyone bad though.
---
The most impressive thing about this is that you made paladin viable in pvp outside just healing
---
Yeah it will have no problem tanking, its average in about all of its stats overall, so has decent dps, hp and armor. Make sure you keep up with the current rank of growl at your trainer so it can hold agro. Wolves also have their own ability called furious howl which will give everyone in your group bonus damage on their next physical attack, and gives itself the buff. They can also learn bite for more damage/agro.
---
The warrior discord knows way more than me theorycraft wise but you are not really sacrificing 1% hit because you should already be hit capped if you have the rest of the gear in the BIS list.
---
Normal build and gear. You just need a healer and another DPS. Also make sure you're the only miner, and one of the two with you is an herbalist and you should be good.
---
Yeah horde is using Painweaver + Myrmidons Signet. So losing the 7 agility is a good trade off.
---
This is the case on Gehennas. A lot more hordes but alliance always coordinate and fuck us
---
2h
---
Thanks for the help. I have a question I notice people take maxing benediction over maxing improved might. Wouldn't the might be better to increase damage?
---
Also, just wondering because im a newb, you don't think maybe taking 1 point out of ret vengeance and having a whole new holy shock ability as that useful? Couldn't that make it more of an increased damage overall instead of the 3% boost of vengeance?
---
I appreciate your help a lot! I'd love to learn more.
---
Played PvP back in TBC and then went PvE. Started Classic and went PvP.....PvE is soooo much better imo. Its more relaxing. Just my 2 cents.
---
Reverse that
---
P2 was great and fun. People who are crying shouldn’t have rolled on pvp servers. The next point on the crying agenda will be premades in BGs. Just wait and see.
---
Ah right, I had assumed both weapons and trinkets could be swapped in combat but I guess that's OP ha.
---
Honestly the rep isn’t super important unless there’s something specific that you want.  So don’t stress it too much.
---
Level 38s attack you on your 48 lock unprovoked?
---
I’m gonna need to see some video of this.
---
nobody signed up for that on purpose idiot
---
I'm sure you can google for them, but there are a few tiers of debuff priorities and the existence of Deep Wounds (and the Fireball dot) was essentially the reason they implemented them back when ZG was released and the number of debuff slots increased to 16. Generally weapon dot procs and other randomly activated dots are the lowest priority and don't matter (with a few exceptions like ignite), but stormstrike, mortal strike, and others including moonfire have a medium priority. Which means other medium priority debuffs can be knocked off when they're applied, which includes some really important ones including Ignite, Winter's Chill, and even Nightfall itself.
---
You never even have to leave, just die and run to north for vendor/repair then die again and run to east
---
I guess people are ganking both ways to dm. There is always an alliance road block next to the fp and another at the entrance to dm and usually a few straggler rogues ganking by the entrance to dm:n . I'm a rogue so its all transparent to me. I enjoy ganking stragglers of big gank squads. I honestly can't picture how terrible not having stealth is right now.
---
I mean.... if you're bad enough to be caught out by this, you probably shouldn't be pvping in the first place...
---
🥒
---
A guild that describes themselves as a progression guild generally means that they want to push to complete new raids quickly when they release, and are generally more serious than casual guilds.
---
Honestly, this video made me a little mad. I'm sick of the constant boat camps. Getting MCd off that far out is a dick move. It's like getting frustrated when you see someone cut somebody else off in traffic. It didn't affect me but it relates to other frustration I've had doing the same thing.
---
To all the 'reroll on pvp if you don't like pvp' shitheads - why don't you reroll on your server as alliance and see how you like it?
---
I think it's just ignorance. And I dont intend to be insulting. When phase 2 hit many probably didnt understand that 10k honor a week was chump change. But when  they ranked anyways they felt like they were *on top of the game* so they continued to camp and get their 20+ honor per kill. 
---
Many also probably didnt/dont understand the diminishing returns on killing the same person, which leads them to corpse camping someone for an hour thinking they are farming that honor like a boss. 
---
But like you said, when they stop ranking and see it was all for naught, they will have an issue.
---
Definitely the pug meta
---
Whoosh.
---
are there DoT addons that allow switch targets by clicking on DoT bar? The best DoT addon I found is NugRunning but it does not switch targets on bar click
---
Safespot =/= glitching guards from the roof
---
5 wars/mages, 1 rogue(defense/stall &amp; call outefc), 2 hpallys/restoeleshamans, 1 fc druid &amp; priest. Can sub out druid fc for another noggenflogger swiftness pot rocket boot skull of impending doom mage and the mages rotate caps. A 2 inch tall slippery speedy frost mage is the most obnoxious FC imo
---
Oh, sure, I thought you meant for the MT.  I’d say a warrior in low stam, low armor gear should shield, because melee plus I resisted breath could global you. A DPS warrior in a lot of plate doesn’t need the shield.
---
Didn't Blizzard say they want to bring things like that back?
---
There's no proof they would. In fact, it seems they are turning their head and ignoring it altogether.
---
Forgive me but I haven’t gotten to endgame yet. 
---
What is this supposed to signify?
---
World pvp is ending soon what??
---
I’ve heard of people 2 manning jump runs with a warrior and a healer. Would that change anything? Or just raise the gear ceiling to make it doable.
---
Christ, that’s what’s happening. 60-40 servers are now 80-20. What do you think happens to the game when it’s 90-10? It becomes pve.
---
You dont rank with honor you rank with Rank Points. Which you get by having a certain standing against your peers. That standing is determined by the amount of honor you gain compaired to everyone that got at least 15hks. If the top honor spot is only 1k honor they will get the top bracket rank points. So like I said. Even if their consistent honor gain is mediocre and not very effective as long as it's the same for everyone else then it's still the best they can do.
---
There is a weakaura that works ingame and you don't need the manual input (click). Anyway, good job, it could help some people who don't use WA's :)
---
A 2h rogue would be scarry thing to see
---
If you are Orc you could use bone slicing hatchet instead. It is very comparable to Mirah's but you get the +5 axes racial
---
Should have rolled on a pve server IG you’re bad at pvp
---
People are quitting over lesser evils than DK, why would he need to post proof?
---
You horde are the fucking #MeToo movement of wow.
---
Yeah, PvP it's fine, but that'd really be the only place a DPS would be able to use it. In PvE they'd have to use a different weapon.
---
Well, they're Alliance after all. Crying is what they do best
---
The first clip..that Mage..holy shit how can anyone be that bad lol.
---
Lol, absolutely not. It originated from "twinkle-toes", describing an effeminate young man in the 70s, and as late as the 90s began appearing in media as describing what the gay community uses it for.
---
Pets can't get the bomb.
---
i am cow, cow go moo \*war stomp\*
---
Um, fire protection potions?
---
Nerf \[night elf\] druids. :P
---
PSA to horde from ally: I'm going to summon an eye from Eye of Arachnida on the boats now.
---
This is going to happen.
---
Whatever strat you use, it’s really kind of a guessing game. Dump rage too early, get fireballed. Dump rage too late, don’t get phase 3 aggro.  We had a Ony group that was very light on ranged and I managed to get fireballed a second time immediately before she landed because I’d built up enough threat and enough other people got fireballed.  If you have relatively consistent ranged DPS you can figure out a good pattern for your group.
---
&gt;Being outnumbered sucks, sure.  But do you want to be the person the cries about it, or pick up your weapons and fight back?  
---
If this sub is any indication, it's cry about how unfair PvP is 🤣
---
It's good to see posts from normal people who know how to PvP!
---
interesting, that does make sense though. I have mirahs so I'll give it a shot
---
K?
---
for sure
---
Maybe I read it on the fly maybe I am just dumb, anyway I am glad I gave you the chance to insult someone. Now go back to your hunt for superiority, man
---
Of the alliance, 
---
Thank you for your service
---
doubt this was fucked from the get go, it's onyxia which is a fairly simple fight. looks like everyone in the run just turned their brains off immediately lol
---
Mind control.
---
Cast spell with travel time.
---
Cancel mind control.
---
So heals for 500-700 aren't viewed as insufficient then?  With the current pace of boss fights, it seems like the focus is more on small, efficient, frequent casts and never pausing for natural regen.  Will this change in BWL or other content?  Or should I start viewing spirit as less efficient MP5 due to meditation?
---
rank1 moonfire makes you swim faster than a shaman.
---
Bleaumeux?
---
What do you expect, that he's going to be 1v2ing high end pvpers? because that is impossible.
---
Quite expensive. You can't really expect a drop either, because the chance of getting any particular suffix for an item is very low. The AH is the only reasonable way to get it.
---
The good news is
---
1. Mages are good at farming so gold shouldn't be too much of a problem
---
2. There are plenty of items available from dungeons that are *almost* as good as frozen wrath, to the point where the expense of the highest level frozen wrath in certain slots, for most people, isn't worth the marginal upgrade over what's more easily available.
---
Can't stress this enough. I've seen an entire forum die because of something like this.
---
Servers are very alive actually. Just get into a new guild and move on. Some people were in love with the idea of having classic but not actually playing it
---
Yeah except shifting without natural shapeshifter costs like 700 mana so even with HotW with 3k mana in all agi gear you’re only able to shift like 4 times before going oom.
---
Yeah, I’ll be dropping herbalism in Phase 4 to do that. At least we have plenty of time to gather mats to level quickly!
---
The coalition is actually some of the shittier guilds, the 2 best guilds on alliance side just go for the bosses on their own and try to fuck the coalition over
---
Menethil lmao
---
This is not true. I level my bow skill on banished Lava Surgers while I clear MC trash.
---
Don’t you office space me
---
I would also add to this to have macros for every stance specific spell. example: My WW is macroed with berserkerstance so when ever i hit it i switch to the correct stance for the spell, just like my overpower is macroed to battle stance. This allows me to switch stance effectively and use my whole kit better.
---
Oh that's awesome and the people ganking like that 100% deserve it.
---
Imagine if you want to shatter combo someone and they drop a target dummy or use the Eye from Strat so you get a DK. It clearly only impacts bad players ;)
---
Yes she is until you get breath+crushing. I have only have 3300 unbuffed HP in my fury gear mind you. Under perfect circumstances you could prolly do it, but one moment you healers are feared and you are dead. I know because I have plenty of time gotten the aggro in phase 3. High healthpool more than anything saves you on Onyxia, and that is something fury warriors dont have with things like Lionheart helmet, truestrike shoulders, devilsaur etc. Even my weapons Deathbringer + Flurry Axe have no stamina on.
---
No one mentioned RFD, if you enchant it’s easy 15-20 small radiant shards an hour. I usually vendor 10g of stuff so it’s around 50g an hour.
---
How useful is CoE in PvP?  More specifically improved CoE?  Is it possible to kite rogues with this?
---
I plan on running a SM/Ruin spec when I hit 60 for both PvE and PvP, and was wondering if I should spend these 3 extra points on improved CoE or will they have more use in improved CoA or improved drain life or what?
---
Why? Its a discussion forum...... 
---
Why is this sub so adamant it needs to silence any and all posts like this?
---
You know that's actually a smart play since the census mods no longer work due to assets being moved to protection
---
5 dks is easily 2 or more deranks which is 2 weeks   of rank points deleted...
---
It's going to vary from server to server, but almost all of your pre-bis stuff can be obtained from dungeons. There is really no need to buy anything as a mage except maybe Freezing Band if you are wanting to min/max. I'd be prepared to drop 1000g on that.
---
But a lot of the higher end "of frozen wrath" stuff is 100g+ on AH. 
---
Again, as a mage who does well in MC, there is not really a need to buy anything. You can get good gear from dungeons.
---
Thanks for clarifying, yep I think that's definitely what happened then. You can seriously equip +healing gear, put the sword on, then change to healing gear and the sword healing calculation continues at the rate as if you had the healing gear equipped? 
---
Man, people would be complaining about this left right and centre if this weapon was actually realistically obtainable. Huge coincidence that I stumble across this post the day after seeing someone with that sword for the first time as well
---
Rattlegore
---
You really need to experience the game with the roles reversed. I’m on heartseeker (massively alliance dominated) as a horde, and the game is truly unplayable in its current state
---
There's calculators out there based on the amount of +healing you have. But with that said, I've topped the priest charts almost every time and usually top the healing charts on Ony and Rag using all max ranked spells and Heal Rank 2. Max Flash Heal, max Heal, and rank 2 Heal are my gotos.
---
Yeah but most mages aren't doing this. They will sheep me and try to run in a 1v1.
---
is there an addon that can track both or do you just have to toggle them both?

I like this idea of keeping a whelp up and on me in P2. Gonna steal this. We are still doing full raid (35-40) but I'm pushing to get us to split raid. GM is concerned that we can't get through her w/o any deaths and the majority of those come at start of P3. This last week she only killed one dps at start of P3 and I got aggro after that. That was using a rage pot. But with a welp and a rage pot we should be safe.
---
You son of a bitch, i'm in
---
Pyrewood village is a solid server for alliance, many guilds to chose from and pig raids each week as well. It is busy and some zones are saturated but a decent economy.
---
I mean, Hand of rag
---
Share please.
---
Then the floor would be the highest. And I disagree, most of the skills necessary to pvp well as a druid are not used while leveling, plus unless you're resto the manapool gets drained very quickly.    
---
I think warlocks have the highest skill floor. Dots and fear can take most classes to 35% health before they have a chance to do anything. And they have a ton of passive survivability with drain life and healthstones
---
The people that feel the need to group up and gank low levels....
---
Are the people that quit - when their whole group loses more than a week's worth of grinding in an instant.
---
Most of my friends are waiting for the BG drop to go crazy. We're in a lull from the BG drop date being specified
---
Current heals my bars (~ 650 healing &amp; 15% holy crit off the top of my head)
---
Heal (r2), Greater heal (Max/r2), Flash Heal (Max/r4), Renew (Max/r1),
---
Honestly 95% of what I cast in MC is either Flash Heal (r4) to top dps off or max rank Greater Heal. The fights are simply too short to bother worrying about mana efficiency at this point.
---
I would probably go with tailoring and enchanting. Although Alchemy is a nice way to keep your tank and yourself always buffed, it's going to be better to switch tailoring with lvl 60 to alchy. (Costs around 100g to level to max).
---
Nothing. Someone just dragged a mob from another zone to SW.
---
Alliance have the most fleshed out story lines for sure, and I think specifically the Human zones.
---
I don't know about Rag, but the Horde kill Onyxia to save the Alliance. In the lead up quests to kill Onyxia, your character asks Thrall why we don't just let Onyxia ravage the Alliance. Thrall mocks your ignorance and mentions that despite there being small skirmishes between the Horde and the Alliance, they are relatively at peace and is the first time their people have had peace in a 1,000 years.
---
He mentions how quickly you've forgotten being enslaved by the burning legion, and how letting Onyxia wipeout the Allliance means they'll come for them next, and they'll be thrown into relentless perpetual war. So by killing Onyxia the Horde are keeping Alliance alive and maintaining their own peace.
---
Not gonna lie, it was pretty easy for many people to rise above the chaff especially on smaller servers/groups
---
Especially playing a warrior lol
---
Does anyone have a guide that shows you what/how to do the bar stage in BRD?
---
Me and my group of friends keep fucking up mainly because we have no idea what to do and we end up aggro'ing the whole bar.
---
Now that's some quality shit right there. Hmmmm yaaaa
---
Obligatory: What addon are you using for raid frames?
---
Is every form of pvp "griefing" for you or just if horde kills alliance?
---
I love the hyper edited videos. Takes me back to the ol Warcraft movies days lol
---
Started on PvP, rerolled to Pagle before P2 came out. BRM was a good enough foreshadowing for me to realize it wasn’t going to be a great experience for me. Haven’t looked back since. There’s still large scale fights to do if I want, and if I flag up I’ll occasionally get into a fight with someone else who wants to fight me.
---
Just maxed two weeks ago (play a lot) and have already had so much more fun doing things like BRD, Stratholme not having a death walk.
---
It seemed to me that the raid was a bit too far behind the tanks, so the likelihood of someone getting knocked into whelps in p1 was pretty big. Still doesn't mean they couldn't get the kill though, and when I say fucked it doesn't mean it can't be done. And yeah it's a stupidly simple fight, it's as you say, people just completely lost it.
---
a shitload of people have both bindings
---
Its crazy how far people go to lie, we tested these and the eye a few days ago. Both are labelled as civs but dont give dhks
---
That's because those people were just playing because of the fear of missing out. They bought into the hype and watched a bunch of videos on the best classes ect. Started playing not knowing what they were getting into and quit. Meanwhile I've played for 12 years and originally leveled to 60 on a PvP server. I warned them against it and they all ignored me. I also knew from past experiences that you should never pick a server for your friends because they will bail. I'm very comfortable on my PvE server. While they have moved on to the next flavor of the month game and are playing Call of Duty now lmao.
---
horde
---
So you're under the impression that the People giving these grinders DHK are also awarded their PvP gear?  Otherwise that's SUCH a stupid comparison to make.
---
Because classic was created with the idea of #nochanges. There still were some unfortunately, but not as drastic and gameplay-changing like OP suggested. Anyway, he has decided to delete his post completely.
---
He is from blasted lands i believe
---
For swords it's just 2x crusader.
---
The +5 vs Crusader maths on MH is only for daggers since OP was asking about what to do with his perdition's blade.
---
Taurens also have a larger hit box than other races
---
I have a guild but I have to rotate ... with others ...   
---
one week raid 2nd ... bench etc
---
ELI5 why is getting a dishonerable kill bad?
---
Only argument I can see against this, if you are dw fury the defense from the oh could be useful.
---
WoW is a horde game.
---
Don’t forget all that pickpocketing time they have while waiting!
---
Hooray!

I just replaced the WW axe last night with Gatorbite at level 50. I definetly understand where your coming fellow warrior but dont give up its a tough journey for us but one that is very worth it! Keep it up bud
---
yes with my first aid ... is it enough?
---
You keep repeating that they don't enforce it well and I told you I already understand that. 
---
The question isn't whether they are bad at enforcing their rules or not. We've already agreed they are. 
---
The question is, if there was 100% proof and it was on a large platform like asmongold streaming it, would they take action? I believe they would. 
---
You haven't said anything to change that.
---
I never wrote that penultimate means second best or second worst. I wrote that it would be (referring) to the second best in that context.
---
As in series would lead to the best dps and the second to last in that serious is the second best.
---
If i got a whisper like that, that would just encourage me to keep doing it lmao.
---
Yup, switching to Alchemy on 60 is probably what we would have done if we ever made it there :D
---
Dont worry about gear until late 40's.  Very rarely is there a piece you would get prior to BRD that will matter at endgame.  And those pieces will be called out in any BiS list.
---
Same time they should start banning replies that whine about the posts? 
---
Why is it so difficult for Reddit to just move past an obviously titled thread that they don't want to read? No, instead you have to come in here and bleat on about how you don't want to read it. 
---
Reading replies like yours thousands of times is far, far more tedious and only seeks to derail any and all discussion because you think every subreddit must be tailored to your exact preferences and you are going to try and silence anything you don't personally want to see. Please fuck off.
---
Aim? I wouldn't go out of my way to get one, considering you can get dreamweave chest at 40 that would last all the way to 60. Robe of arugal is pretty good for it's level, and robe of the lich from RFD is great but requires 39.
---
+15 agi/+15 str to weapon is coming in P3. DM maul just a lot easier to get, especially if you do 2-3man stealth trib runs.
---
But using the Yeti for this purpose and this purpose only is exactly griefing.
---
And griefing is against the rules.
---
The same way as stacking shrinker and standing inside a leg of a civilian and "protect" yourself.
---
I thought it only went up to rank 2?
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?search=Crippling+poison
---
&gt; you could literally bait people into accidentally getting DKs.  
---
That's exactly the point, but you're not wrong in that some jollies could be had. I'd even admit to getting a sadistic kick out of the thought in my office. Thing is, since this is, as we've both agreed, a mutually possible undertaking, I don't see anything really "unfair" to this clever use of game mechanics. (#nochages, right?)
---
Unlike safe-spotting, these aren't abusing holes in Blizzard's AI. It's abusing holes in other players' bloodlust.
---
&gt;the majority of boxers also bot.
---
Source this claim?
---
Do what you want. That's good advice for this game in general.
---
with Rhok' you clip everything with aim shot as soon as it's up.  some weapons will do better if you don't clip but rhok' specifically it's better to use aimshot on cooldown ignoring auto's
---
I've generally understood a progression guild is a guild that pushes to do content as quickly and efficiently as possible. "Pushes" can vary depending on their skill and level of commitment: Required Consumables, Required World Buffs, and Mandatory Raid Specs. 
---
They'll often look very closely at parses, talk to you if you're not pulling your weight in comparison to other people playing your class/spec, and give you a chance to fix whatever the problem is. If you don't they may move you to their secondary raid or put you in reserves. 
---
Currently, I consider a "progression guild" to be clearing MC 10/10 in less than 2 hrs. All Raid Spots and Debuffs have been solidified for BWL.
---
If I'm leveling a mage as an alt, should I keep herb and skinning at 60 for farming?
---
Are you familiar with the word "most"? As in:
---
&gt;most of those things provide some sort of asset that could later be sold
---
Not to mention that all the people I know that ski/snowboard as a hobby bought their own equipment and could resell that if they ever decided to quit or for some reason needed the money.
---
\#nochanges
---
What about the epic trinkets? How does one prepare for obtaining those?
---
Is the nasty man forcing you to read it. 
---
At least I do have the ability to block clowns like you that call for deletion of anything that isn't shit posts and memes. My god you fuckwits are tedious.
---
if you're only at 250 healing you're not even close to prebis. 600 is a good number.
---
with that low healing your only option is to up ranks max consums/flask to even get close to someone in decent gear.
---
Good druids will beat most mages.  Druids are pretty strong against that class.
---
What is it in OP's video that you're upset about?
---
Haha. NICE. As someone who doesnt care abt ranks its just endless entertainment for me. 😂
---
Why's that? Lol I don't know any better honestly
---
&gt;but on the other hand playing on a PvE server also makes the game not worth playing, for most at least.
---
i think you are extremely mistaken here, i think the vast majority of players are buying into this "pvp is real wow" or they have friends who are buying into it. 
---
I think if you remade the servers now you would see a wildly different pvp/pve ratio
---
Loatheb does a raid wide debuff that does a ton of shadow dmg. This debuff goes out faster and faster until pots/bandages cant keep up. The fight only let's healers do 1 heal every 30ish seconds. So you have to kill him asap. Even in good pserver guilds, the first couple of kills are super close.
---
Following
---
So let's continue keeping bored bitter alliance as is. World pvp is not gonna change much. Hordes are gonna que and world pvp waiting for queue to pop anyways.
---
Thank you!
---
If it doesnt have snutz' seal of approval... its just a guide
---
Shitheads @ Activi$ion refuse to dedicate any additional resources to WoWclassic. They probably have some beancounters that show it’s more profitable for the stockholders to milk classic wow as long as possible with as little support as possible.
---
In group pvp it can be useful, but in 1v1 pvp it really is never that good.
---
Get timers, use CoS, don't use CoE, read your tooltips and think about what the spell is doing.
---
They were so mad about a few DHK they quit the game?  
---
Also why would anyone attack this thing if they are ganking players?  It starts an RP with the Goblins and it runs around.  It doesn't target players or do damage.  The whole thing seems fishy to me...   Since you are able to recreate on command post screenshots from in game and the QQ in discord.
---
Thanks, I'll mull over this.
---
Ehh, it just knew a very weird shortcut 😉
---
it tanks a percentage of your honor gains dependent as well on rank
---
as a rank 3, 1dhk takes about 20 minutes of good pvp to undo
---
at rank 10+ a DHK can mean hours of honor lost.. at rank 12+ a DHK can make your rank ups take another week at worst (ive heard of some back in vanilla being able to pull a rank up from 12 to 13 with a DHK that week.... but they had to pvp almost nonstop for 20+ hours to undo the damage
---
Man. I really need to convince everyone in my guild to farm this item before next raid reset. When running to MC, a wall of 100+ horde is usually common. Just imagine for a moment the glory if 40 of those were to appear right as the sappers come. GLORIOUS!
---
You just fed them honor!
---
Good job
---
Get a boar to lvl with. Charge, Dash, relatively tanky, and they can eat literally anything. Yes wolves are cool, but I think you would have a more fun experience with a boar imo.
---
Battle and demo are pretty close but battle only gens threat when applied to targets without battle shout, usually use demo if battle is up, otherwise battle. I always go ss&gt;ww&gt;dstance&gt;cleaves at 4+ targets, if ur only at 2-3targets its probably better threat to go straight to d and cleave.
---
I played both back in the day AND on private servers, you shouldn't base your argument around things you don't know.
---
I want classic to improve and it's the people who insist that the game is fine and shouldn't be changed at all who had no clue what they were signing up for.
---
Player vs player is all it means
---
OP's clever use of mechanics is not an exploit. You have the choice to not kill the Yeti. You can't defend against rooftop campers, the only option is to avoid the area (which I did because even though blizzard dishes out some light bans for it every once in a while the horde on Gandling still does it frequently enough). Also, it was never "fixed" to begin with so it's clearly cool enough to leave it in the game for Blizzard while they give you a slap on the wrist if you get caught.
---
Yea. We know this is going on. Its not just you. All you can do is wait until wsg and av release and hope things change.
---
That’s because we are outnumbered 90% of the time
---
Seems like all two handed classes can equip green + healing gear, then go back to their regular t1 or t2 pvp shit and be a vanilla death knight.
---
small indie game guys, calm down /s  
---
but seriously how hard is it to do this? I got my rank but according to last week i lost 20k honor from my honor tab
---
this isn't programming though.
---
I do, isn't stopping roof campers anyway.
---
Honestly, I'll settle for a compromise that ensures that dummies and other similar items (such as that eye thing mentioned above) not be usable in BGs.
---
One of the warlocks said he started playing warlock recently in retail . I’ll pass lmao. Kargoz is tight though.
---
Are you ready to apologize yet or should I send you the new blue post that I know you've read.
---
Minor bullet point, very minor regarding "repair the damage if possible".
---
Are we done yet, or do you need another lesson
---
i dunno
---
Tested this
---
..... no DHK's.......
---
Horde with ally buddies on same server.....
---
That would be a low skill floor, you're saying it takes no skill to be a lock.
---
Huge mistake... and I play horde on horde dominated realm.
---
So join the global chat, ask "is SG FP camped" before you fly there, or if you did fly there warns others.
---
And then ask your faction to form a PvP squad and go annihilate them, its not that hard.
---
Why the fuck wouldn't you just fly to red ridge and ride up?
---
1. That's not what a strawman is, I have not mischaracterized an argument
---
2. Yes, they are, the people who are fond of PvP now are not fond of ganking going away, that does not take 200 IQ to figure.
---
There are a bunch of things on wowhead's guides...you should start there.  Lots of resources through google too i'm sure.
---
Allow faction change to the lower population side on the server. Also free epic mount to do so
---
Holy shit that is savage
---
Lvling in a lvl 20 area as a lvl 8 is going to be a bad time. You will aggro from very far, die a lot, your heals will do very little to a lvl 20 and you will have no quests where as your friend will have quests. Also, you will actually gain very little to no experience from a lvl 20 mob at lvl 8 with a lvl 20 in your group. Essentially your lvl 20 friend will probably level 10 times faster then you in a lvl 20 zone and you will never catch up this way. My advice, get to lvl 16 atleast and tell him to just level his professions while he waits for you to catch up.
---
I'm sure this has been asked/covered, but I don't know the exact words to type for Google search.
---
Is there a way to run a dungeon with my main, then log out, and log in with my alt to pick up all the BoP loot?
---
et me stress this : it is an estimation. We Will never have the number
---
What target dummies too? This is a game changer. Don't they even auto swap targets in PvP? 
---
That's just broken
---
Rogue vs druid should go towards the rogue if you use all of your cooldowns, but good druids can deal with rogues.  I beat rogues fairly often.
---
Just gotta know when to trinket and how to deal with you.  If I can get you faerie fired after trinketing kidney shot I stand a good shot of beating you.
---
&gt;part of Sylvanas' backstory shows the Night Elves sending support to the Alliance during the Second War, ultimately battling the Horde together during the burning of Quel'Thalas.
---
??? That must be some heavy retconning because NE did not exist during the second war.
---
I gotta ask, why not rez and go play in another zone? I understand that it might not be your first choice, but there is more to do in classic than run UBRS. You don't *have* to play right into the hands of the PvPers ...
---
Horde are killing the community.  Alliance are rolling over on their backs.  Alliance will eventually have faster bg queue times, and horde will complain incessantly.
---
Like you want a macro that tab-targets automatically for you?  Not sure that works, but you can try some macro-building resources to see if target switching can be coded in.
---
Just because they have a prot tree and tanking items doesn't mean they are on par with warriors. That's another logical failure on your part.
---
You lose rank progression.
---
No there is not, you can however run multiple accounts through same dungeon
---
I know I’m late, but I read this is Louis’ voice.
---
That's a shame.  The sword will be useless in a week when everyone gets their TUF
---
Of course not...but not clear morons isn't too much to ask.  The talent seems to be there.
---
Isnt plan b still searching for a tank for their 3th raid? Not my guild but last msg i read before logging out.
---
For sure man, i just asked if GoT references is the most crinch. U agree right?
---
Lol... “broken mechanics”? 
---
Stop whining. Reroll on a pve server.
---
You basically just told someone in a question thread, created to ask questions to go google it..
---
"Farming people" = PvP working as intended
---
Preventing that = griefing 
---
Interesting perspective.
---
But they have to kill the stupid thing...  I don't see people just aoeing right on top of the goblin for this quest on my server 24/7  How do you expect to "give" someone a DK with this method if they are just single target ganking people in cities?
---
Fuck no. I rolled a  shaman on Faerlina with a friend before we knew it was  the  streamer server. Leveling wasn't bad, because I  was ahead  of the curve and pvp fights were generally balanced. Once everyone else  started catching up it simply became a cesspool of wasted time. Rerolled on the RP realm and  my time in game is far more enjoyable and productive.
---
The only guys I know on there are VoiVid and Kargoz. Kargoz is a good content creator but lacks knowledge of the class.
---
VoiVid is legit, I learned a lot from his videos.
---
You could buy a Sword of Zeal from the AH, which is nearly as good as the Dal Rend MH.
---
Sinew definitely doesn't have a 100% drop rate, I've killed Onyxia 10 times since I got my leaf and quests and it hasn't dropped.
---
Wait why are you stalking my profile
---
Yeah it should show up in your buffs. What he said sounds right. It procs fairly often, do you see other buffs?
---
&gt;Then on the days where the alliance aren’t fighting back with numbers, there are hundreds of horde in every zone running around desperately picking off any individual player they see, which kills any feeling a threat, and makes for some crappy farming for gold out in the world with so many horde running around looking in every corner.
---
This is the biggest issue, it isn't really population imbalance. I'm alliance on heartseeker and we vastly outnumber the horde. Even then, they control most contestd PVP spots. Most of the alliance are refugees from horde dominated servers hoping to get away from it. You ask for help when you're getting camped and you get no replies. You try to get people to defend the menethil boat and you hear crickets. They just want to PVP when its convenient for them (as in FP camp or gank squads), not when it's time for real PVP. 
---
The amount of players willing/wanting to do PVP are the determining factor on how things go on the server. Not just overall population.
---
You obviously have no idea of what a cache does.
---
haha yeah, it seems like it forgot it's autorun on and toggled it off in Dun Morogh where it took 180° back to Ironforge
---
I got CoE and 3 pts on improved CoE
---
It’s never been useful to me. 
---
I’m thinking of respeccing move the points to improved drain life to make fel concentration just a bit better. 
---
I hear CoE is only really useful during Naxx but I don’t know about that.
---
Yeah, and the graveyard is next door.
---
Mine did roll over but weren't correct lol
---
I made sure i was above 15 HKS last week (just barely made it at 17)
---
Now it shows I only had 10.
---
I don't really care bc I'm not trying to rank but this is comically scuffed after the display issues and the 3-8am fiasco
---
&gt; They probably have some beancounters that show it’s more profitable for the stockholders to milk classic wow as long as possible with as little support as possible.
---
Correct
---
I started with a specific site at least.
---
Do you believe that people should come here, ask questions, we google it for them, then post the link for them?
---
Yea, that’s how it should be most of the time, but this was such a ridiculous situation. Especially for what seems to be not a very advanced guild. 
---
A more advanced guild would have easily handled this situation no doubt, but not because they had fewer people laughing on Disc.
---
Same issue here. Even more drastic change from 17HKs to 10 lol
---
I see a 63% drop chance online. Maybe we just got lucky. Either way you can do 1-2 onyxias a week, it’s not a hard item to attain.
---
What a shit weapon.
---
Shh that makes too much sense
---
Sounds like this game isn't for you
---
Dear diary
---
You all chose the pvp server option and knew that   areas could get overrun/occupied/camped this is what I did back in vanilla-wrath and it is part of the game.  Like it or go play PvE.
---
&gt;if you do 2-3man stealth trib runs.
---
Even easier, you can solo tribute runs as a druid if you've got engineering/BS and have some caster gear.
---
defense isn't a stat you should be chasing anyways. The offhand is useless unless paired with the MH. Dalrend MH will give you more damage on WW so I believe that edges ahead in aoe situations. I'd personally lean towards the dal rend set if you already have that.
---
id keep herb for sure for dm east. skinning isn't as good since dm north farm isnt as viable
---
daggers: not optimal (pve and pvp) but more fun (subjective)
---
swords: optimal (pve and pvp) but less fun (subjective)
---
Personally I would stay swords, but what do I know
---
Thats weird I specifically chose orc to corpse camp filthy alliance in hopes they would complain on reddit.
---
Honestly the fact that you can only kill members of the other faction makes it watered down compared to normal 
---
It’s kind of boring pvp servers
---
TFT had a portion of the Scourge being set free of the Lich King's control due to Illidan attacking Icecrown. Those undead formed the Forsaken under Sylvanas and conquered the Plaguelands from Dreadlord control while Arthas went to Northrend to save the LK.
---
The mark of a true idiot is someone who decided to roll a horde toon in classic lol
---
Yeah and as horde I can't level my character because every 2 minutes I'm killed by a new alliance group. Then they portal out before any actual resistance forms and do it again.
---
The problem is you think you're the only victim. Your teamates are doing the exact same shit. And because of it, I have zero remorse making allies spend an hour walking to BRD. In fact, I hope they quit.
---
well, its still a shitshain on your honorsheet. have one myself from someone aoeing despite being told not to...
---
Jesus christ people really dont like dying and having to corpse run. If you want to pve you deal with it and if you want to pvp the competition is almost here in bg’s. I just dont get these posts.
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should :P
---
For you.
---
Thank you for missing my entire point. Now fuck off.
---
Not to take anything away from Snutz, but Dusch, Goth or Seuche make any other Warlock I've ever seen PvP footage of look like a joke.
---
The fact about possibility to CC a honorless debuff hasn't changed though and this is exactly what OP wanted to change.
---
&gt;Its only "vent" if you somehow jump to the conclusion that anything you disagree with is automatically someone being "mad".
---
The whole flair is vent/gripe. Gripe doesn't imply being mad.
---
Unless you can hit 48 by the 10th, it doesn't matter. Re-roll!
---
Check my latest post for answers!
---
I guess not :)
---
I was charging 10g for whipper nodes if people needed them for quest :P
---
Which is the whole point, I’m not sure if you are the first or last person in your guild to get your bow. And I’m not sure when you’d started this whole process. But all together it’s maybe a month or two, before you get rhok. Melee classes will be using strikers through phase 4 I’m pretty sure... that’s months and months. And this one hunter is too lazy to do his hunter quest and takes a medium upgrade over someone else. IMO it’s just disrespect to the fellow raiders in your guild.
---
imagine praising a person for griefing. awful community. play victims all day, but some of you guys are part of the problem.
---
My main got an updated rank and my alt I've been grinding honor on hard has no update... Come on Blizz you are scaring me...
---
Pssst. Find a mage, get a port. Problem fixed!
---
did you expect everyone to just decide "we dont want to kill the other faction" and 1v1 you? LOL
---
You can only have one Renew on the target so if you're the one using Renew, those "dumb dumbs" aren't dumb at all because they realize they can't use it if you are.
---
If it’s totally fine and just that easy go roll on a pvp server then
---
Curious how that works if your rank is dependent on where others are at. Do you just keep your honor and the rank is determined by the new servers standings?
---
&gt; The way it was used here, "the penultimate dps spec of classic", would mean the second to last dps spec that was released for classic.
---
This makes absolutely no sense. It's obvious the writer wanted to refer to dps spec based on power level. Which one is the best, highest, strongest.
---
The sequence would also obviously be going from worst to best dps spec, and the second to last in the sequence is the second best.
---
Just do a simple test. Replace penultimate in the sentence and see if it conveys the meaning that was intended. It doesn't exactly the opposite.
---
No one here thinks the ultimate dps spec means the last to be released. They are of course talking about the best. Penultimate is always in relation to what is ultimate.
---
This is gold. Ty made me laugh and smile like a fat kid at a comedy show eating cake.
---
You are excused! I quit at the end of Cata, funny how our views and remembrances of the same game will be so different
---
&gt; The only assholes are the ones whining
---
Not the people who're willing to devote a good 4 hours of their evening to ensure nobody can actually have fun? I get that it's well within their rights and not against the ToS, but c'mon, that's a dick move and it always has been.
---
Some people just ok with sub optimal specs, so if you want eat shit - you can eat shit.
---
Why?  If it's solely pieces from Classic, I see no problem with cosplay.  I actually enjoy seeing what people create.
---
The bigger problem is clearly the UD strat item. That thing would be a HUGE gamebreaking problem if it is in fact usable in BGs.
---
As far as the yeti is concerned, the main question is whether it can be made aggressive to attack without being provoked. If it can, then it's a big problem since it would be a huge exploit against any targets with passive revenge damage. If not then I still think it should be fixed, but its not a major problem.
---
Right now, only on whitemane there are a few warriors running around with this sword and exploiting the snapshotting technique. I know of 4 warriors with Robes of the exalted and alot of +heal greens. They can solo A LOT of content that way. Or just 1v2, 1v3 with ease
---
&gt; I am fairly new to the guild
---
Maybe they do not trust your commitment to the guild, and would rather reward a long time raider with a purple that is a slight side grade rather than a new member they are uncertain will continue to put forth good attendance.  Or you know, nut up and ask one of them one on one why they gave it to fury DPS, when it was a bigger upgrade for you...  That would be the reasonable thing to do when you have a dispute instead of brew over it and post on reddit :-/
---
Soul Link and Ruin?  I don't think that's possible no?  Its SL/and shadow burn or SL/Nightfall asfaik
---
My guild just bring 3-4 dps warriors who saves their cds until she lands. They then pop all of their cds and this means one of them are getting aggro, he is now the main tank. Make him swap to a shield and tank. Its also important that the rest of the dps are not doing anything when she lands.
---
If you're still Arms then sweeping + WW is about the possible opener for 5 man pulls with 3 + mobs. It's very solid opening threat. Neither B shout or D shout are particularly good to use for threat since they patched them. You use them if there's a situation where you need to generate instant threat on 3+ mobs and you don't have access to your opener (like if a boss spawns adds in the middle of the fight). After your sweeping + ww opener switch to d stance and start tab-sundering and cleaving. Revenge on cooldown.
---
I love that a resto/balance druid is able to do this. They are pretty underwhelming in classic, they didnt get seriously good until later, but its still awesome to see a druid able to do this in classic
---
Quick someone alert asmon!
---
You need a guide to PvP as a warlock...?
---
I'm a Warrior and you do better with adding quests to your insane dungeon grind.  That said, if you're on a pvp server, good luck doing either one if you're on the wrong side of the beat down.
---
Yup.  And the amount of paladins is way too small on my server last week.  6% of the pop was reported pally compared to whorde shammy.   
---
This week seems more paladins were rerolled as the number jumped to 13% lvl 60s lol.
---
hit 'em with that max rank, go oom, then flame the raid for not doing enough dps
---
Rolling new wont be effected too bad. You will notice the short comings of the server faction balance the moment you reach brd. If you die 10 times... pray and hope that its resolved by bg introduction.
---
Encrusted tail fins is the worst quest in the game. Swimming and trying to kill elites that run away when low health?
---
Delete character, reroll on other faction, take out the scum who ruined your character sheet. Simple.
---
LOL I feel the same way. Ive been leveling an alt and thats my similar experience, when you get ganked by 60s and cant quest, you think im going to feel any remorse when im making some alli do the death run to brd? Nope.  
---
Hell I was on my main and got attacked by 2 level 47's since I guess they thought I would be easy honor? I try and let lowbies go on by but when im getting engaged on while trying to go about my business, now im killing every lowbie I run into.
---
The writer used the word wrong.
---
You’re taking that quote out of context. The original context for “repair the damage if possible” was a generic set of steps for approaching issues of this nature.
---
How about we use a more relevant quote, one that requires no context:
---
&gt; All the kills are still logged, none have been lost.
---
Warriors are kinda stacked with fear immunity already tho.
---
What type of loot system are you using? Some form of DKP or loot council would solve this fairly quickly. But saying you are running with another guild, I assume you are rolling for gear? If so it's just ms&gt;os, if you are the only other person in tank spec you should be the only one rolling on it. If the fury specced sometime off-tanks rolls on it, it is reasonable if he is forfeiting his chance at fury gear to roll on tank gear, but that doesn't sound like the case. Talk to the GM about it, if you don't speak up, you will keep losing out on gear.
---
look at mr. Neuralink over here going for BiS bandage speed with his mind
---
SM/ruin and DS/ruin are primarily pve builds, the later being the most focused for max raid DPS.  SM/ruin is at least ok for PVP, but certainly not ideal vs SL/NF/conflag builds. 
---
I would even argue SM/ruin is better for dungeons (for pet utility) and DS/ruin is very much a one trick pony for maxing your molten core parses.  For a green raid having all but 1 lock go DS/ruin can help the raid clear, so its still worth going that route as your guild/raid is first running MC and until you get some better gear.  You can run pretty much any spec for Ony.
---
Yes if it drops in a chest like major domo, DM north tribute, and seven dwarves in BRD.  No if it drops from a corpse.  You would need to have a trustworthy friend lend you their log in creds to have them power level you through dungeons.  Or they can do it themselves if they are not busy with playing wow.
---
OK.
---
My character has not updated properly. I have not received any RP for last week. My Last Week tab shows my record for Nov 19-26. My This Week tab shows my record for Nov 26-Dec 3.
---
You have to find someone the same level and equally geared, wait for them to finish killing any mobs, wait for them to eat and drink to 100% hp and mana, let them buff up, make sure there are no mobs around that can get pulled and then get a third player (who has an equal number of 60s on both faction so he's not biased) to countdown otherwise it's griefing.
---
Charge in with berserker rage up already, the first  few hits will generate additional rage giving you sweeping strikes.  You switch to zerker and cast WW. From here you goto defensive/blood rage and can go either cleave, or sunder, on targets that may have low threat.  
---
I'll sit in defensive with a 2hander depending on the pull I may use my shield.  Demo shout should be applied after the first WW.   Now we're tabbing through for 1 white swings on each mob, cleaving sundering when needed. 
---
Cast whirlwind again, you can macro weapon swaps or use a 1hander, I like to use the 2h for extra threat.  
---
Piercing howl is a good talent incase you have no mage.  And it slows them if range agros too early giving you a few more seconds to reapply sunders and pick up the targets.  (if theyre really low hp don't chase, unless they're non-fleeing targets then maybe).  
---
If you're not immune to disarm I try to get that sweeping/ww off asap, when I lose the weapon I switch to shield and use tclap to atleast apply some threat, while cycling my white unarmed swings.
---
Don't forget to reapply berserker rage if the fights exceeding 30 seconds, that additional rage helps alot, and may end up helping with a 2nd sweeping strike rotation.
---
You can only have 10 out at once. so you try the math out.
---
1. My main is a hunter, so I would rather be a different class. A rogue seemed like the next best thing for me.
---
2. I currently do not have the time to farm gold because my college semester is wrapping up. Besides, I have already spent a great fortune on this character and need to save for enchants on both characters as well as my epic mount on my main. Not to mention the fact that I plan on making twinks for other brackets too.
---
TLDR: I am too far invested but currently do not have the time or money and still wish to part take in it.
---
That's fair enough, more will be required of players in the future raids as well. Might as well get them used to the idea of preparing for raids.
---
Oh dont be snarky. Source? Its an opinion. One I hold after 15 years of seeing boxers also bot. Constantly. 
---
But maybe Im wrong. Maybe guys who download all that software that helps them cheat... don't cheat and they just look at the pretty lines of code and think about "what if". Yea, that *must* be it.
---
That doesn't change what the word refers to in that context.
---
As a horde I sometimes go to redridge and attack a couple lvls 20s on the road once just to have a couple of 60’s to show up. It’s not like I’m there to grief level 20’s, I just kill them once so they complain in general and summon some 60’s. Makes for fun small scale skirmishes until 15+ fly in and I have to leave.
---
And that's supposed to be easy?
---
Is it worth coming back? I was leveling an alliance Druid as my main and got to level 52 before inadvertently taking over a month off from playing. I’ve been logged in for 20 minutes and have spent the majority of that time as a wisp because even ungoro crater has 60s just riding in circles waiting for me to dare to unstealth so they can two shot me. 
---
I’m not 12 this time around, I can’t dedicate the time I did before. Someone camping me in vanilla was just a test of who gets bored first, but I have other shit I need to do now. If I manage 2 hours to play and spend an hour and a half dead, how do I justify that?
---
Tauren hidden racial is busted.
---
Hitting someone from 30 yds is just broken. Once you've played the absolute BS that is tauren melee range you will never go back.
---
Yeah I imagine getting hit with crippling poison makes CoE useless anyway.
---
Yeah there’s an ench recipe actually for agi on a 2H and I got ench. Damn it there has to be a way to farm somewhere you wont get camped.
---
Thanks for the replies though, everyone.
---
Yeah I really screwed myself going warrior. I wish I had been a druid. Could have been that heart of the wild / resto spec and tanked 5 mans and healed raids. I really hate DPSing. Currently I'm 31/5/15 Arms which will be nice when BG's come out.
---
Make a GM ticket. I know tanks that fucked up and got the trinket only to realize how garbage it is compared to the neck later on. They made tickets and got it changed.

robes of the lich or shadowweave robes.

Nice dude. I would want to brag too.. although not on this sub.. the toxic miserable sarcastic cynicall no life losers are already flocking to diminish your sense of achievement
---
Thank you for making such a detailed post explaining snapshotting. 
---
Snapshotting needs to be fixed, 1:1 scaling is fine. If a warrior wants to run around in full + healing green, have at it, he'll do no damage, have no armor and have like 2k HP.
---
This is a paladin weapon.
---
They shouldn't have launched the honor system as stand alone. Phase two should have been the introduction of the honor system and BGs.
---
&gt; playing on a server where you actually do world boss encounters instead of having 300v300 throwing bodies at each other and the boss until one side wins.
---
Pathetic
---
Enchanting is a gold and time sink. You'll never make money on it unless you're 60 and 1) invest in expensive recipes and sit in trade for long periods of time, 2) in a raiding guild and are in line to receive a very rare pattern drop.
---
It's cheaper and takes less time to just find an enchanter if you want your gear enchanted. Waste of time.
---
Tailoring can be useful for bags but again it's probably a waste of time. The materials used to create bags cost more than just buying the bags outright from the AH. Yes you can use the cloth you find to create bags but you're really not saving money creating your own compared to just selling your cloth and buying bags straight up from the AH.
---
I would say the only reason to get tailoring right now is if you're a priest, warlock, or mage, because you can make a bind on pickup chest piece that's real good but you need to make it yourself to have. So as a paladin, tailoring is a waste of time.
---
Basically if you want to level these proffs for fun, go ahead. But they are a waste of time and gold. Speaking from someone who is 300 tailoring and 300 enchanting on a priest. I will drop tailoring as soon as I create the chest piece, wish I took engineering or gathering proffs like mining or herbs to make gold.
---
I had a couple rogues in my guild that would sell merciless gladiator. All you had to do is play the bare minimum of games in 3v3. It was relatively inexpensive too, maybe 1000 gold.
---
Professions have marginal benefits while levelling, the best thing you can do is get skinning, mining, herbalism and sell everything you find on AH.
---
At 60 use the money to level your goal profession
---
Census mods do work now, they're a bit more annoying to use but they do work. [Ironforge.pro](https://Ironforge.pro) uses raid logs as a sorta pseudo census. It's probably decently accurate for max level activity, but less so for people still leveling.
---
The fact that you think being a minority and not enjoying getting killed more than killing people makes you a "carebear" is kind of funny. Blizzard can't just stop people from making Horde characters. More people want to play Horde for min max reasons. Alliance didn't see PvP population increases until they threw some new racials at them, and then the problem just went the other way instead. PvP servers as they are today are not fun. The fact that a level 30 is flagged to level 60s is stupid. The fact that level 15 questing zones are contested is stupid. People can choose to play the game however the want, but PvP servers have shown that they are anti-fun and just fundamentally don't work. If you denied people transfers then they would just quit. Which isn't any better. 
---
Also why didn't you make an Alliance toon. Or were you too pussy to even play the non-overpowered faction for PvP?
---
WoW was removed from my life willingly all 4 years of college to avoid this exact problem.
---
Blizzard banned people for doing quests multiple times on retail (wouldn't register as completed) . When people gave the naive dumb comment "but i was just questing, Not my fault it keeps showing up" Playing a naive sheep doesn't make it right.
---
What's it like to be this dense?
---
And using potions isn't allowed, even if you are an alchemist, only engineering tools are allowed.
---
Why is your +healing so low? 
---
I have +700 healing and always use R2/R3 heal (R1 greater heal if damage is spiky) in raids, max rank flash heal. Fights are short enough that either I don't run out of mana or popping just one mana potion is enough.
---
Counterargument: The overwhelming majority of bullies live fairly normal lives, are not traumatized in any way and are not extraordinarily evil characters.
---
Did Vicious Cycle transfer to Kil'Jaeden and merge with Premontion to create Huge in Japan?
---
Cut them some slack, it's a new system.
---
She militarily supported the Horde and publicly showed deference to whoever the Warchief was for 20 years. Usually that's enough.
---
If it was like this in classic it doesn't need fixing, that's the whole point
---
Anyone have any idea what spec this dude is using? Really looking to get into druid PvP and this looks like a ton of fun
---
How can I get maps of inside the dungeons? I have Atlas, but it says it is missing another required addon
---
No, thanks. I’d rather enjoy my time on wow.
---
Honestly, wait a week until BGs are released.  The world PVP should calm down significantly at that point.
---
I'm not sure what you're asking - who are "try hards" in this case?
---
According to the complaints here, the horde have an easy "I win" button that frequently summons raids of 20 v 1, which would imply there's no trying hard going on.
---
As long as the alliance keep trying hard to fight back, then I'm sure the horde will stay.
---
The people complaining are really a small vocal minority, so it wouldn't change much.
---
I'm not even playing Vanilla right now but remembering that it takes about 3 months of rank 1/week grinding honor to get R14 and took me a whole summer to get Field Marshal - dunno why it's hard to believe people wouldn't rage so hard about that :D
---
I’m currently lvl 53 (mage). The only place I can level up us BRD because of world pvp. Any ideas for a “hidden” or less known place where I can farm exp? Thanks
---
Hahaha imagine getting this mad to lie about making people QUIT the game because they got a DHK... LOL
---
Redditors are so pathetic, yeesh.
---
It’s not trolling to tell someone to get over their whining or take the action that would fix their problem. 🙄
---
See, point proven instantly by this fine lad above. Already says he unsubbed but still keeps playing a game he hates. Blind rage and addiction is real.
---
Enchanting is actually a terrible choice unless you are willing to dedicate time and money into buying the top tier patterns and afking in cities for long periods of time. It works better with mages and rogues, since they have other services they can offer as well.

Great guide!  Been following Kargoz's content for a while now and he's very knowledgeable about wow in general and the current class he plays.  He always goes deep into whatever he's talking about.  
---
Shout to to Crix, master Lock.  Have learned a ton through his tutelage in the Guild.  Def one of the best I've seen around and a fantastic PvPer!   
---
If your looking for an all in guide and what to do situationally against specific classes, this is def a guide worth checking out.
---
It is a very hard affix to find, especially with maximum wrathness.  The key items you should look for are the helm, the chest (if you are not getting another tailoring piece), the back, and the bracers.  All of those give ~8 spell damage over something similar.  For shoulders and boots you can get more secondary stats like int with boreal mantle and omnicast boots.  Legs and hands you might get some from MC if you can't get a boss drop from LBRS, so I don't feel it as important to replace or find on the AH.
---
*to some people. It definitely wasn't universal

Thanks for all the comments guys, this cleared the issue for me.

Or just wait till the 10th when they will a lot less people in the world pvping
---
If you want my two cents, for me playing on a pvp server is so i can play and be amongst the best of the best, the nerdiest, sweatiest min maxers. Because competitive people thrive off other competitive people. And knowing there is a ‘pve’ non elitist option signals to myself and other elitists that ‘casuals’ and ‘lesser players’ go there. Do you understand the logic? 
---
 No top1 druid world, plays on a pve server... so where is the credit in killing a druid on pve server?
---
Died down? Lol
---
The logging conflict in Ashenvale started in WC3: Reign of Chaos and clearly still continues in WoW (see: Warsong Lumber Camp). This gives the Night Elves a reason to dislike Orcs more than Humans and thus joining the Alliance. Not exactly shoehorning IMO.
---
Do hostile NPCs path onto the roof to attack you?
---
No Ravager, noob!

Or else what?

Those Naga are a great farming ressource with lots of greens and the other upgrade to your gear.

yeah, not everyone does it but it is realistic if you cared enough. Or wanted to be a god for a month or so
---
Everything after you crushed into the mountain was delirium.
---
I'm thinking like Deadmines right now specifically. 
---
Could I go clear it through, invite a friend, log out main, log in alt, go into Deadmines and pick it all up?
---
Cleave only hits two so if it’s 3 you should WW.
---
They are supposed to shoot at you, but I have heard that the Darkshire NPCs seem to have trouble doing so
---
Haha this is true, I hate when people tell me to just get to level 60. If that was what I *just* wanted to do, I would do it.
---
If you are questing a bunch stay shadow. If you start doing dungeons and want to actually heal switch to holy around 55. You still quest, its just harder. If you want to dps dungeons and not heal, stay shadow

Its not good advice because you cant have both soul link up *and* sacrfice. This sub is so dumb sometimes, I swear. You can either have 1 or the other, not both. Also once youve sacced your pet, all those points that went into demonology are now useless, if anything the OP should spec 2/2 Master Summoner and then the rest into affliction.  
---
The thing is though, "get 60" is the actual legit advice. while the +120 damage gear isnt bad, 2.2k hp is abysmal, they arent living if they get stunned at all and most people who are 60, now, are at least wearing prebis if not better.
---
Looks like 30/0/21 to me
---
Don't get cheap on me Dodson..
---
I don’t understand this. You’re just stealing content, right?
---
Myzrael is a good server. Alliance dominated 70/30 but horde is great
---
Aah missed that part.
---
Nithore is wild.  Always in Badlands making PvP groups
---
They aren’t having any of that.
---
No. Just roll on a balanced one and instance level from 48-60.
---
Classic WoW is a PvP, open world interaction game... raid logging is extremely low content.
---
Just don't roll on servers like Skeram and Stalagg.
---
Doesn't say literally anything that you tripled it. You original HK/honor could've been 1 so tripling that wouldn't be such an game breaker.
---
This is my life as a tank basically. One toon. No real alts. I have to tank all the time for everyone, so no time for alts. Already have a binding and am geared to the teeth. But, i get to play one toon and really on that guy for the long haul.
---
The word doesn't make sense in the context in which it was used, as you said before : "This makes absolutely no sense."
---
They used it to mean "best dps spec," and that's not what it means, just like when people wrongly use "bemused" to mean "mildly amused" when it actually means "bewildered."
---
If you want to say that one dps spec is the "best, highest, strongest," you need to pick a different word.
---
&gt;So if they were "griefed", or corpse camped by a raid in a city for a week or two, you think that's all right
---
If you actually spend 2 seconds processing my reply, you would have made the link that i referred to those people as a thief. (considered bad in our modern society) So no, i dont think that what they are doing is alright. But neither is this solution. Stop putting words in my mouth, cause you can't read properly.
---
Blizzard allows input broadcasting as long as it's a person doing it, IIRC.
---
Does ally have an FP there?
---
Yep I rolled horde on a pve server and now all the morons on pvp servers will ruin my queue.
---
It's not bad at all until you hit lvl 48, after which you are in a more horrid version of hell
---
That's a 50% chance
---
right. obviously you have trouble keeping up with more than 1 reply at the same time...
---
Well, just reverse faction and it's same thing.
---
In this case, Horde players are the bad ones. Reverse faction about this post and it will be fair enough that's someone posts "Alliance players doing Alliance things" and I will not even bat an eye. The only difference in this case, that post will be upvoted to the top because it's cool to be a Horde and hating the Alliance. That's the cool thing since PS became a big thing. :)
---
I'm kind of in a similar boat, I have all my tank prebis and most of my fury prebis. I was in dps spec and started to raid with my guild that has 2 groups and clears all the time and Im more casual so I didn't hit 60 nearly as fast, one week our MT couldn't make it so I got asked to OT in that group, now they just get me to stay prot and OT on 2-3 bosses. Luckily we clear MC in 2 hours so it's not a problem that my dps is super low for the rest of the raid. At least I'm in and get the experience in a good group then moving to a shitty guild
---
Only need 2 real tanks and 1-2 that can tank if needed. Shit sucks. I'm in a guild that had exactly 4 tanks when I hit 60 so I had to make a 3rd raid group just to raid
---
oh, so now you moved to ''on par with warrior''.
---
ill wait a bit see if you change your stance again.
---
Orc is the best race for nearly every class, including warrior.
---
Escape Artist is nice but you're not beating any equally skilled mages 1v1 anyway, neither are you ever catching a druid. In group PvP, you'll count on your healer for dispels / Freedom.
---
Meanwhile resisting stuns is incredible both solo and in groups, and Blood Fury  is an incredible bonus.
---
i'm a druid so my heals are different, but i'm throwing out r3 and r4 healing touchs a lot due to the 2s and 2.5s cast times they have, and they heal for 550 and 850 respectively or so. my raid typically overheals a bit and without healing assignments, so if i don't do this, i end up not really getting any healing off (except my rejuv on tanks). on fights with higher raid damage, i'll bump up to higher levels to top people off asap.
---
you are definitely low on +healing, according to another comment of yours. make sure you scope out the AH for good +healing greens in some slots that you think you won't be replacing easily, they help a lot. don't go overboard, since you still want enough int and spirit to get through fights, but higher +healing drastically helps with efficiency. until you get higher +healing, the higher ranked spells will be more mana per healing efficient, so if a fight is longer, considering letting health bars dip a little further (assuming no one will be at risk of dying) and using the higher heals.
---
so, it's okay to heal for lower amounts like that, and it gets better with higher +healing. but, there is a bit of trouble with overall raid healing efficiency, since if you're constantly sniping in small heals underneath others' large heals, you might just be causing them to overheal. in MC, it doesn't really matter, but your raid's healers might want to get together to figure out how you all should be healing together to maximize efficiency going into tougher content like AQ40 and naxx down the road, maybe bwl if you're all having trouble there.
---
one final tip: always be casting. even if no one has damage taken, pre-cast a heal on an active tank and just cancel it (quickly tap a movement direction, or use escape if you don't want to move at all) before it completes. this does not interrupt your 5 second rule at all, since what matters for 5sr is spending mana. but this lets you effectively react to the damage a tank will take much quicker, allowing you to top them up quicker.
---
It's actually not higher damage, at least with improved coa (which doesn't add much). And with more spell power and amplify curse the gap only widens
---
Hey, I love you. lol :)
---
They have tools to deal with it but IMO you can never have enough CC breaking tools.  I think fear is so much more of a problem in PvP than stuns (as horde).
---
Cannibalize is really nice too for in combat healing.  The damage orcs get is hard to argue against, but IMO the more fears you can break the better.
---
Oof, I remember that feeling.
---
I don't suggest downranking if you don't have high +healing because it's definitely less efficient, but don't use max heals either because other healers are also working and it's easy for you to overheal with max rank in a raid environment. 
---
I didn't really calculate things, just tested different heals to see which ones struck a good balance between my mana pool and healing performance. Adjust as you get geared :)
---
Honestly, borrow money from a friend.  Pay them back 10% interest
---
Oh please. If you are sad enough to gank levelling hubs, don't whine when someone gets you back
---
Is there even a well balanced pvp realm in classic?

lots of mages miss my wraths with CS, because their cast bars show it as taking longer to cast than it does.  I would say at least 75% of mages will miss a 1.1 second wrath cast and blow their CS for nothing.
---
Go ahead use them pathetic items, and use them in bg's aswell, the meta will shift back to flight-path camping and u will cry again.
---
But what about the one in the top?
---
Its not just the threat from the proc, its also the slow debuff. If tank doesn't have TF too, the slow can rage starve the tank and crater their TPS without the proc offsetting it.
---
Oct 30th? Is that why you talked about how easy 57-60 was on Oct 8? Why do you even bother lying on Reddit?
---
While you can check a downrank calculator, normally the most efficient heal for any class is the one right *below* 20 rather than the one at or right above.
---
If you think a minus 3 karma on a post is getting downvoted HARD....oof you have only seen the best of reddit🤣
---
Then do what i do raid log and wait for december 10th its not rocket science. Am i missing something???
---
I'll sum up everyone's thoughts on it for ease.
---
1- Hordie that rolled on a stacked server-  "Phase 2 is great, I love going around with a 40 man raid and stomping 5 man alliance parties trying to reach dungeons. No problem with imbalance, git gud, kek"
---
2- Outnumbered Alliance player- "Half my guild has quit, I can't find groups because there's no casuals left to part with, I can't do anything in the world without being camped until I log out."
---
3- PvE player- "sHoUlD hAvE rOlLeD oN a PvE sErVeR" and then rolls around in a pile of his own dung
---
&gt; Multiboxing is explicitly not cheating.
---
So Im guessing you dont know anything about boxing. Much of the same software used to box and broadcast is the same software used to bot and cheat with automation. See ya done learned something new. Congrats.
---
My group tried getting into BRD and had to rez up and port out (took a bit of time).  We choose to go to Scholomance, and that was still a 45 minute journey  of death, but we did make it.  It doesn't matter what instance you want to go to, the Horde will kill you.  It sucks, because I only have a few hours to play, so when you dedicate it to just dying, it's not a fun experience.
---
I'd say they were still friends :) In the original clip, they look at each other before the bomb detonates, and smile - I cut it because it took a bit too long :)
---
Have faith in the Emperor, Captain.
---
They will be limited in what zones they can reach.  There's no making it to BRM as horde in the time it takes a queue to pop, unless the queue is over 20 minutes and/or you get a summon to BRM.
---
You seem fun.  Could also be because not everyone spends hours min maxing in-game profit and progression, they just are playing the game. 
---
I could use essence of water but I haven’t even leveled fishing, what a pathetic lazy idiot I am.  If only someone as smart as gnomefurywarrior was here to tell me how to play my video game correctly, the I too could spend hours sitting in front of a fake fishing pool.
---
only 50 deaths then, see things are looking up!
---
Are you the kind of guy who /flex by killing lowbies at MH? Yes, you are.
---
You think you good at the game but you are not. :)
---
I believe you have to be present for the kill.
---
An unusual, but clever solution is to have rotating MTs. Basically, each week you have a different MT, and that player has loot prio over the other tanks for the week. The biggest benefit is that your guild won't collapse if the MT leaves, making the guild much more durable.
---
The downside is that you will have 3-4 less geared tanks rather than one very geared tank, which may slow progression.
---
Shout out to Distributors of Pain on Agamaggan...  I remember both these guys though.  Small world.
---
Yeah sorry it's pretty unclear. What I would defined try hard are the people that devote a lot of time in the game in a min max perspective (I feel I am one of them).
---
A. I think we need some non try hard to have an healthy balance.
---
B. We need some casual to actually feel powerful and have something to compare to.
---
Ie: if everyone is full T2 you don't feel special having it.
---
It make the prestige integrated in classic way more "real".
---
&gt;The people complaining are really a small vocal minority, so it wouldn't change much
---
It may be but it's not the feeling I have when following alliance twitch community. It's seems less and less of a minority every day
---
With vanish it makes it not nearly as terrible
---
You’re a sad sad person, glad you quit.
---
Why are you sooooo serious! :)
---
&gt; I do, but after reading the post all I hear is “wah”
---
If you hear that while reading, you might have tinnitus.
---
Wait wait wait, you mean people would let me dps a dungeon as priest??
---
Have you tried killing the Horde?
---
I have 30 spellpower and 55 healing enchant and I’ve made less than 100g in tips in a month or so
---
Seriously i have no idea why people try to claim its balanced, horde have  always been better at pvp except maybe briefly with EMFH, they try to look at their personal character stat of 50/50 when they afk'ed out of half their losing battles.
---
You don’t need to no life to hit 60, 14+ weeks in, just be generically not shit.
---
The #1 ranker on Faerlina Horde has sat at the Thorium Point FP for 3 weeks straight. You're wrong lol
---
gotcha, bummer. makes sense, but bummer.
---
I paid 40g for my unyielding maul. For something that is almost the same as a 300-500g weapon
---
What does a dishonorable kill do exactly?
---
I still think a middleground is better. Not 3-4, not 13-15k. Just 8-9k is best of both worlds.
---
A bigger shitload have none.
---
Your reply indicates me that you are offended by a way or an another? Are you okay? :)
---
This. We only lose 1 or 2 people that don't get threat reset during P2 b/c we bring her down too fast, even in a 20 man. Only works if you're properly geared for fury/prot in the correct fury/prot tanking spec. I tank all of MC like this as well, even Rag.
---
&gt;OP's clever use of mechanics is not an exploit.
---
Intentionally resetting a PvE quest, to use a PvE item, which happens to spawn a *civilian* target, and which for some inexplicable reason is hostile to enemy players ... to grief other players PvP rank... is most certainly an exploit. It's no less of an exploit than if there were a quest pet that could kill civilians without penalty to grief PvEers. 
---
Call a spade a spade, stop the mental gymnastics.
---
There are plenty of items that will gain value in later patches that aren't valuable right now.  
---
Huge Venom Sacs for AQ WILL spike.  
---
So will Heart of Fire as soon as the transmute that lets you make 3 Elemental Fires.   
---
Arcanite likely will see a spike when Thunderfury becomes available.  
---
There are plenty examples of things that are guaranteed to go up in the future if you look around.
---

Reapersfault said: "Mine is at 1 charge left [...]"
---
They were talking about the quest reward version of the yeti, which is only obtained after turning in the quest, so your comment doesn't really help them.
---
Both classes are great and extremely dynamic in PvP situations. Rogues also happen to be very simple in a raid setting.
---
Ah gotchya
---
Yeah... so you don’t ski apparently. It doesn’t cost $600 unless you’re a Jerry
---
She's immune to taunt
---
&gt; It's completely fine to use penultimate intentionally here.
---
No, it isn't.  It doesn't mean what you're trying to make it mean.  It only relates to one definition of the word "ultimate" : "being or happening at the end of a process; final."  It means "second to final".
---
Sure casting renew may be noob, but overwriting it or sniping its heal is even worse.
---
We've got 4 hunters who got a helm each in 4 weeks and we've since disenchanted 4 more. Name of the game, baby.
---
I had almost 2000 DHKs before they removed them last time. I didn't realize they were gonna be around again...
---
I saw someone with the same issue saying it was finally fixed for them when they updated this morning.
---
He's not playing an offspec. He raids as boomkin. His guild lets him raid as boomkin. Boomkin is his main spec. If you don't want boomkins to get gear, don't recruit them to your raid lmao.
---
The idea of this isn't to make others lives miserable just because you can...the idea to penalize the people who camp towns.
---
If you could just go dish out DKs (you can't), that would be an incredibly douche thing to even want to.
---
Lol yeah I’m fine :) Stopped caring a bit
---
Yeah I'm there with you. Got my epic mount and now I'm saving for lion. It's crazy how much gold some people have. Like I see others warrior riding around in epic mount and lion helm along with over 1000g worth of boe's.
---
"Ah this looks like a nice game, log in, fight against 40 horde with zero teammates. Your goal: run to a spot on the map that's a 5 minute walk away except you will be killed by the 40 enemies within seconds of beginning. Just walk back again, come back to life and die instantly again for literally an hour, gaining absolutely nothing until you arrive. Yes that is a game that I would like to purchase" - nobody, ever, in a million years of gaming. Are you telling me that people signed up for that on purpose?
---
Haha ! I hope so :)
---
Kill the spiders in SoS for shadow silk to craft shadow weave gear.  Then cold whisper other priest to sell them at a mark up.
---
Lmao I got 2 t2 helms on my rogue and another 2 rogues have 2 as well since its the only damn thing that drops, had only 1 viskag and we split runs so 2 per week
---
This was not a guild run, it was an open-roll PUG not long after release. Believe it or not, there are a handful of people who play this game that have just enough of a life that they can't run organized raids religiously every week. I am lucky to get in a couple of raids a month. In fact if I ran with my guild (as I sometimes do) and the leaf dropped, I'd pass to make sure a regular hunter gets it before me since I know I won't be running every time. There was no reason to pass on the bow in a pug where every other hunter rolled on it.
---
That is *really* weird.
---
There's plenty of places to get honor that aren't ganking people trying to level. This isn't griefing, the people using AoE's inside of quest hub towns are doing that. Go join the other thousands of people camping the 20% of the server that's the opposite faction from you as they try and get into Blackrock mountain and feel confident in your PvP superiority.
---
My vanilla server was a PVP server, I do not regret rolling on a PVE server for Classic.
---
You went across the 8th dimension, there, Buckaroo.
---
damn man that's brutal lol. Happy you finally got yours but I would have probably stopped playing before then lol. Guess I don't have it so bad.
---
I mostly just want a new weapon honestly. Our guild and raid groups super into parcing and I have shit swords. I been trying for damn Dal Rends but shit never drops. Only time I've seen damn hunter won it. And of course it was after fucking Dire Maul release so not even BiS for the dumbass anymore.....
---
well if this does come to pass then I have no choice but to get those pants hahaha.
---
All you need is decent damage to burst someone down. I've seen 2 warriors doing it. Hunters, warlocks, shadowpriests, you name it. Mostly it's done with more than one person though do ensure a kill.
---
Yeah, in the most trivial sense lmao. 
---
That same software is used to do a lot of anything that involves pressing keys in any way. It’s pretty generic stuff. 
---
You might as well say “I’m guessing you don’t know anything about keyboards. Much of the same hardware used to play games is used to hack the pentagon mainframe”
---
Any proof? That sounds like bullshit
---
Welcome to my world. We had 3 mageblades, only have 4 mages. They're all geared out and we're DE'ing mage gear now.
---
We have 7 dps warriors and two of them are meme race, so they want swords. There's 3 of the 6 of us rogues at swords, but one already has both brutality and viskag one from a PUG and one from having the highest dkp and winning a roll.
---
So basically I'm competing against meme warriors for swords. I don't want to go daggers but if I have another couple unlucky weeks I might be forced into it.
---
You might be thinking of this quest? https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=8735/the-nightmares-corruption
---
I was heavily involved with our guild's efforts to create the AQ scepter and I don't remember anything about having to kill the 4 dragons.
---
&gt; yea. I know we have a fuck ton of mages so some of them struggling as well but we have had a lot of caster loot drop.
---
I'm a mage, I've been raiding 10 weeks or so and have gotten one drop. We have 8–10 mages and 6–8 warlocks, we went three weeks in a row without a single caster drop besides the fire damage gloves off Domo.
---
good feedback friend. 
---
Guess what... people like you annoy me so much so I guess we're even? lol
---
there is plenty of plate gear with strength, stam and +healing on it that is not classic specfic even if snapshotting does get changed
---
/cheer for hours
---
If you’re pushing the top echelons of the ranks, even one DK can make a huge difference. The first is like 3% of your progress, if you were in the top 100 or top 50 of players at current highest rank, this would be a massive setback. In the current state of honor farming, I do not respect these people, they are either honor trading or camping relentlessly for 10+ hours per day every day
---
Rules without consequences aren’t rules.
---
You can do everything up to raiding as a DPS spec. Just keep a good 1 hander/shield on you for the bosses and dangerous pulls.
---
If you have a good, fast 1-hander, you shouldn't have much trouble with threat. Not sure what level you are, but these are some good weapons you can get while levelling for tanking:
---
Thrash Blade (1h sword from Maraudon quest): It's slow, but the effect is gnarly.
---
Mirah's Song (1h sword from Scholomance quest): Fast, well-balanced sword.
---
Bone Slicing Hatchet (1h axe, drop from Maleki the Pallid in UD Strat): Fast, well balanced axe. Preferred if you're an orc, due to the hit bonus from the Orc +axes.
---
5 pts in demo for the stam talents with a conflag build. Also you have succy for seduce.
---
It really depends on how many Alliance players on pve servers do premade pvp as well.  If you combine pve and pvp servers population together the faction split is close to 50/50.
---
Alliance (you) to Horde.
---
ally rushing through corpse-camping lights hope then porting away when they still outnumber us, allcaps #GRIZZLY
---
If they are just getting to the mid 50s 3+ months after release, how is waiting literally one more week less appealing than rerolling and losing another 3 months?
---
Gotta love RNG
---
Probably [this one](https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php).
---
What kind of farming capabilities do druids have? I currently main a paladin and farming kinda sucks, I know I eventually want a level 60 druid but I'm thinking of doing it sooner rather than later so I can use it rather than my paladin to farm gold.
---
Its very simple, you open new PVP servers with a much lower population cap, then you force faction balance on those servers and let people transfer off their mega servers with horrible imbalance to smaller servers with forced balance. Lots of people would opt for that experience over what they have now, from both factions.
---
Battle gives full threat if it’s up or not as long as the targets are in combat with the mobs you’re trying to tank
---
If you have the opportunity I would pick a server with a primetime that is not the same as yours....   Like an EST server if you are PST.
---
Thats 50 DKP minus !
---
This is a version of the tolerance paradox. If you grief the griefers, you're not really griefing, you're fighting back. The only way to stop people griefing is to piss them off more than they piss you off; just like how the only way to end intolerance is to be intolerant of the intolerant.
---
Rocket helm bro. Take 1 person out of a group fight. Sappers, and bombs are also great. Didcombobulator to demount people.
---
In wc3 grom &amp; the warsong displayed overt disobediance and instead of keeping him closeby to rule with an iron fist he left him alone while being chased by demons. Said demons obviously were able to easily corrupt him which enabled the burning legion to launch an attack on Azeroth.
---
Then when he left the horde instead of appointing a wise Cairne or Voljin to replace him he put in a young and brash warchief who was already known to hate non orcs and had the tendancy to be overcome with bloodlust. None of which are good traits for a leader of a diverse group of people who have on several recent events teamed up with enemies to fight a common threat.
---
Third time was even though the forsaken were known to be using the horde he kept a lid on it. This let his lieutenants keep their faith in Sylvanas who was eventually appointed to lead the horde for her personal gain and to the detriment of the group.
---
Thrall has shitty farsight for a shaman.
---
Do you use floating combat text? I believe it even shows up there as well.
---
Is that equivalent to 100 HKs?
---
I stopped playing until bgs come out
---
Compendium of the Fallen
---
Neatplates - It puts these, i don't know what they're called, spikes at both ends of the mob's health meter (the meter appears over the mob).  No spikes means no threat, yellow spikes means you are next on the threat meter, and orange spikes means the mob is coming for you to eat your babies.
---
I'm still trying to level my main to 60, it took a serious halt once phase 2 hit.
---
Saying that the tanks had to have 4p dreadnaught is just false. It's more of a "nice to have" than actual requirement.
---
Kevin gates carry me through the grind. #idgt
---
At this point I am thinking about it lol. We have had 6 corehound dagger gloves drop so I can get next pair on greed roll. Plus like 7-8 epic dagger drops with 0 swords. At this rate might get daggers before swords lol
---
1% hit doesnt make up the spell dmg difference, not even close
---
This is bordering on /r/iamverybadass 
---
I'm guessing there's zero proof of people quitting classic 100% due to his use of the mechanical yeti.
---
This is genius! I wish I could afford to give you more.
---
I've been starting to think we might be slightly alliance favoured
---
Get the addon "itemrack" and you can easily set up macros to switch gear, even automatically triggered ones such as when you mount, dismount, cast a certain spell etc. Or just bound to any buttons
---
Ur gonna want tailoring again for bloodvine set
---
T2 isn't everything, mage T1 is better than T2.
---
Next person that tries to camp me questing I’m using this on
---
Is it worth it paying for all those accounts? Genuinely wondering... or do you get the game time from tokens?
---
Trying to call out someone on their “yeah I was Glad ranked for like 4 seasons”?
---
Great initiative, but unfortunately incredibly poor execution. Please remake this in a way where its possible to see whats happening. Even just not having a mob hitting you would be tons better. Why didnt you just have a friend hit you constantly with a non damaging spell like curse of recklessness or faery fire? Or use unitframes you can scale up? Or a weak aura to track HP gains? 
---
So many things could have made this actually useful.
---
But as i said, great initiative!:)
---
Oh, i am selling runs, but if a guildie needs something, they get priority and i never charge guildies for anything. Super hard for me to make gold, so i try and sell services when i can.
---
Nah, this is a relief for many. I’m horde on a horde dom server and couldn’t give two fucks, we are going to have hour long BG ques because all the alliance quit from the relentless world camping
---
The painful thing to realize is that strength and agil arent really that great of stats for the HotW build or any feral druid pvp build. You basically want stam and int because you normally win your fights through attrition not burst. In vanilla feral does not scale very well even after they finally add +feral att power gear in aq.
---
So ya in the end you want the stam/agil/str only gear pieces for pve and stam/int gear pieces for pvp.
---
The more you want it harder it is to get it seems haha. I just need to stop caring about T2 helms and maybe I'll finally get one.
---
lol well funny thing is my alt is a rogue, and he's gonna hit 60 any day now and this will become my life too. It's gonna be one hell of a grind lol
---
Report all the threats and have their accounts terminated
---
The efficiency element you're missing is the five-second rule. This doesn't exist on retail, but what it means in Classic is that casting large heals infrequently is substantially more efficient than spamming downranked heals for most Priests.
---
Indeed, this is *why* Priests (and Druids) heal tanks rather than the raid - so they can cast-cancel large heals and maximize mana regen. "Always Be Casting" does apply somewhat to Shaman/Paladins in Classic, but it's mainly a retail thing (where FSR doesn't exist).
---
In terms of Flash Heal, you are correct that there are times when you need to minimize reaction time. These occur often in 5-man and PvP. They occur almost never in a raid setting because you don't have armies of enemies beating on a non-tank (as you do in 5-man) , you don't have enemy players with rapidly firing attacks (as you do in PvP) and you're not trying to heal through pushback (as occurs in both). Instead, you have relatively infrequent raid events and slow swing timers in PvE raiding so the only advantage of spells like Flash Heal is that you can snipe other healers (which is not actually 'good healing' but 'bad healing' despite what the meters say).
---
&gt; My guild is getting ready to transition to a core roster for BWL and ensuring we are all doing our jobs correctly.
---
I can almost guarantee you're not. However, it's almost always easier to address healing problems with raw dps than it is to get into the complexities of structuring an effective healing team.
---
Look at it this way: I can either teach some Mage how to gear and how to press Frostbolt repeatedly - or I can teach a healer how to dynamically react to an entire team of players with the right selection of healing spells and techniques. Which do you think is easier to do? Where should I spend my effort first?
---
[Here was a Horde Ambush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUZpplTO8k) on my server. Typically TM vs SS is pretty one sided but when both sides are pretty evenly matched it becomes really fun. I'm afraid I don't really record my gameplay but TM vs SS usually has 2 elite small groups that fight around the masses in the middle trying to set up flanks etc. And when we're done, we just leave and aren't flagged anymore.
---
After putting up DoTs, drain life or wand.
---
I'm a shadow priest though
---
It's all healing gear lol
---
34:62 sounds like paradise coming from skeram.
---
I was told if you miss that taunt you're basically screwed
---
I doubt this is accurate, or they would have to combine servers.  And they have not done this yet.
---
Rogues fun though so as long as you enjoy playing rogue it is what it is. 
---
I do like raid nights so I will keep playing just sucks when you almost always on the bad end of RNG.
---
&gt; Some of them got so pissed off that they've quit the game from what their guild mates have told me.
---
Lol people on this sub are crazy.
---
Polymorph?
---
"With the world pvp phase ending in a week" - cold you explain this? What is acutally ending this week?
---
Meh I can afford it.  Is it worth it for people who drive a tesla to have a $1000 car payment?
---
Leveling alts still log in for raids, so Ironforge should be accurate for amount of active players on server.
---
I'm not sure in what fantasy dystopian universe you live in, but this shit happens ALL the time. If my 45 druid kills a 45 mage that's questing in the same spot, I may as well change zones because I can bet on my life that at least 1 60 (usually more) are on their way to start some shit and farm honor.
---
Imagine if you spent the last 3 weeks playing 16 hours a day doing scummy tactics to maximize honor grind, and some lvl 56 shit gives you 3-4 DKs essentially putting you back with the people who only played 8-10 hours a day doing the same pace of scumfarming. In a span of 1 hour you could lose weeks of “progress”
---
I mean it could be possible to make a new tanking spec for warriors. That much self healing would generate massive amounts of threat.
---
Its broken.
---
Your tier is, what I'm saying is most of the top caster gear isn't tier anyway so you can use it.
---
I checked with my buddy in Australia, he said barefeet/failflame passed.
---
You’re on a PvP server and you’re surprised there’s ganking in areas where targets are generally worth honor to 60s? Of course there’s ganking in every 50+ zone, honor dropped still really recently. From my perspective it’s died down quite a bit but I’m not stupid enough to think I’m going into certain zones without encountering a shit show so I avoid them.
---
What is the current "best" pvp server for alliance? I'm planning on rerolling a rogue to raid and would like to know the US server with the most competitive guilds and what time they are raiding. Thanks!
---
It doesn't affect anyone who isn't ganking people inside 3 specific towns that are full of quest NPC's and stuff for people leveling, but that there's little or no need to visit at 60. The people camping these towns are looking to gank non-60's, and deserve any DHK's they get.
---
Seduce would like to have a word with you
---
A little better?
---
Thunderfury is BIS threat weapon through BC Tier 1....
---
A big part of horde on whitemane is a ton of Taiwanese players playing at at odd hours (by American standards). It's hard to tell without confirmation bias how close the ratios actually are. Maybe when aq opens we can see everyone gathered in one spot.
---
You sound bad at this game, do us all a favor and stop commenting and just quit...if you wanna keep playing find a guild and ask for help, you need it. Trying to do WoW solo will not turn out well for you
---
You seem like a worthless sack of shit what's your point?
---
If people arent going to put the effort in and still have the audacity to tell people what they are doing is wrong they are fucking morons. You don't have to min max to be able to see that spending 2 hours moving around the 5-6 pools in a small area is a good place is a good way to make money. Maybe if you pulled your head out of your arse you'd know this.
---
That's silly.  Your tanks are sitting around building aggro on the 8 adds?  That's a lot of extra damage for no reason, when they can be simply taunted when you're ready to kill them.
---
Incredibly useful in world pvp or grouped pvp. Max range instant cast no cooldown slow makes it impossible to run away from you. Very good for catching people out of position. In 1v1 scenarios its less useful but has clutch uses
---
It might be for them i suppose. I get what you’re saying. But what about the terrible guilt eating you up from inside when you go to sleep? Worth it? lol
---
True, sounds like most of the subreddit quit because they couldn't handle a pvp server &amp; are just happy about this news to come back and exploit their way to griefing people.
---
When I condemn it, I get massively downvoted, but it's fine for 99% of this subreddit to take the moral high-ground on everything else ever. shit sub lol
---
&gt; Dat shadow life. That's the thing with rogues their Tier pieces are actually most of the time BiS lol. So I super want Bloodfang helm &amp; pants
---
Lucky, mage BiS now is 3 pieces of T1 (2 individually, third only with the set bonus), and phase 3 it's 2 pieces of T2. Tier is mostly useless for us.
---
[British accent] : After the tragic death of gryphon ans its passenger on a dwaven mountain, an investigation has been open up. Few days after, the investigators have found a large quantity of illegal gobelin alcohol in in the house of Gryth Thurden, the well-known gyphon flight master of ironforge. We are not aware of his intentions yet.

AtlasLootClassic_Maps is a separate addon that works with AtlasLootClassic to give you the map portion. You need both otherwise you wont have the maps.
---
I'm not entitled. I didn't whine at all. I literally just called 'em dicks, which they are. Being a dick and going against the rules are two very different things.
---
I feel like I see these all the time on my server
---
How does that saying go “It’s PvP on a PvP server.”
---
Sorry, but if the attitude that griefing players is “PvP” then DHKs is the same thing. I guess you horde will have to pay attention to what you’re attacking instead of just AoE’ing for 60 yards around a corpse.
---
Ahhh the dreaded 1 missing talent point, the same thing keeping me from being able to combustion&gt;POM&gt;Pyroblast on my mage
---
I feel for ya bud
---
So you've been splitting epics among 40 people every week for... 8-10 weeks and you have gotten several epics, but not the one you wanted?
---
Yeah. Sorry. Maybe you wanted it first week, but that's the nature of the game. If specific epics are your only goal, you're probably gonna have a bad time.
---
Not an expert, but I think shockadin are looking for a 31/20 or 32/19 build grabbing imp devotion or redoubt, extra armour, 3% hit, imp BoP, kings and imp hammer.
---
+1 foot Threatplates.  It changes mob health bar colors based on your stance and whether or not the mob is targeting you. 
---
Defensive Stance? Green if targeting you, yellow or red if not. 
---
Some other Stance, flip the colors.
---
No... I just wanted to see my own mediocre ranking if I can even in find it...
---
I was reading your post like omg, oh crap they got him, omg camping the dead devilsaur, and then the ending I shouted "you did it you crazy son of a bitch you did it !"
---
in the lower brackets its anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hours worth of farming.  but it really hurts in the top brackets where it could be several hours of hardcore pvp grinding.
---
600 is a little high a bar - that's closer to "completely ideal", I'd say 400-450. But yeah, at 250 healing, he's got very little preBIS and needs to continue 5-manning up to at least 350 +heal.
---
Your warlock class lead and raid leadership should be working this out and making sure all debuffs are clean and planned out.  Typically one warlock, an SM/ruin with nightfall, would get a slot for corruption. 
---
I've carefully watched debuffs and logs for a couple weeks now after cleaning up  our debuffs in general across the raid.  We don't run annihilator and rarely have a shadowpriest, so I'm considering allowing a second corruption.  Most raids will still limit it to one for various reasons, and could run none at all, but just giving some insight here. 
---
The DPS added from one extra DS/ruin lock dropping corruption isn't huge in the grand scheme of the raid, and if there's any risk an important weapon (annihilator) or spell debuff (winter's chill) could be knocked off it's not worth the risk.  There are some funny circumstances that can happen here with debuffs and some procs and timing. 
---
For trash packs and bosses with adds you should be fine to corrupt an off/secondary target (that is not being sheeped!) to start ticking their health down while the raid zergs the primary down.   I.e. Sulfuron Harbinger has four adds, you can corrupt the three that are not primary raid target.  There's almost no risk that debuffs mess up in that circumstance, those adds die fast, and by the time you're on Harbinger your corruption has fallen off.  You can probably use corruption on the dog packs near Magmadar as well, things like that. I usually spam all the dogs with corruption sort of as a timer to know when I can hellfire and not risk aggro.  DPS is decent with that strat as well.
---
Maybe you should read the preceding like 15 comments and then you might have your answer to that?
---
r/classicwowplus

Salty boi
---
So no you are not saying that and disagreeing with what I said, you are just saying random things at me somehow blaming me for getting ganked dozens of times by hundreds of idiot hordes
---
Hey man, I get it. It sucks and its a shame so many people are having a shitty time. Try rerolling on another good server or quit. I'll just be over here on my perfectly balanced and amazingly competitive rppvp server watching the QQs :)
---
earthshaker is nuts in pvp. its basically just as good as HOR for warriors, because they can proc shaker with hamstring.
---
I don’t see it as losing anything. It isn’t like they are deleting everything. If they wanted to come back or if blizzard does server transfers (which will more than likely happen free money).
---
Why would you need to hearth back to find a new group?
---
The Community on Atiesh is pretty great.  Im glad I rolled here with my crew after playing PVP in Vanilla.  As an adult now I dont have time for that shit.  Plenty PVP to be had in contested zones if you choose to participate.
---
10 DKs and an ogre spawns irl and bashes your head in
---
Yeah this makes no sense. After BGs come out the open world will be way less deadly. This issue is with higher server caps the shear number of players on the server makes World PVP crazy. Most of these campers will be in major cities queueing for BGs and not at black rock ganking.
---
This won't be a horde/alliance issue, this will be abused on both sides. You also cant pay attention to a thing that is instant summoned in large aoe battles. Stop being petty.
---
Good luck seeing as those sections are relative for that specific reason - it's not graded.
---
&gt;Behaviour
---
&gt;Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
Abusing a quest giver for the sole purpose of griefing people (because this can hardly be considered a legitimate pvp-tactic, as it does not provide an advantage in the PvPing per say, only meta (by moving people down in brackets, which is something you cannot do normally), nor intentional) falls under this category. I would be extremely surprised if it isn't acted upon.
---
gotta have the XL dps meters tho
---
"developed" is a strong word... they are horrific mutations that must be hunted, killed and devoured. they are a plague that must be cleansed, for the of good all Azeroth. 
---
I mean, just look at their ingame models - they used to be glorious trolls, now they've turned into a bunch of fucking fluffers. but you're right, in a sense: the horde wouldn't ever accept these monsters.
---
Skill cap is so high on a PVP druid. Once you get there you're tough to beat. Specially resto with mana gear.
---
Honestly leveling Fury is fine in my experience, however I would strongly urge you to put the remaining points in Arms for TM as that utility is a godsend, epsecially if you plan on tanking dungeons at all. You should be able to tank BRD if youre high enough level, however personally I wouldnt attempt LBRS without being full prot. What level are you btw?
---
There is a old video of a 40 man priest ony raid. They wand her to death.
---
If you dont want DHKs you shoulda rolled on a PvE server dude.
---
Yeah, the more I think on it I don't see any major reason against it. I would definitely want to only allow players that have made it into BRM though because otherwise opposing faction would exclusively camp flightpoints since players would just ghost run from there.
---
Try unequipping the weapon and re-equipping it. It should have a decent enough proc rate to proc almost every fight.
---
This only worked at launch for efficiency. We who did it then wont do it again, for the most part. Its still doable. But not efficient.
---
This post reminded me to remind people that zandalari trolls can't be warlocks for completely bs reasoning
---
"But zandalari don't like fel and demons"
---
No shit, that is every races culture. Warlocks don't do it for popularity points.
---
Yeah, sure, average WoW player will surely do that. Not saying that isn't possible, but far from your average player.
---
"specific epics"...... I mean I want any epics I can use that are good. I roll on stuff that drops but always low roll. Plus how many you know who already have some crazy ass epics or blues they hardly done anything for? It's RNG but when you always on the wrong side of it and you see others winning stuff all the time it does get a little annoying. 
---
I Know people who are new to classic who have won some PreBis rares before even 60 lol. Yet rest of us normal folk run those dungeons 30,40,50+ times and never get them lol. Its what makes the items so sweet once you get them, but also can be frustrating.
---
This item can be summoned in BGs. You shouldn’t ever be able to get a DHK in a BG. 
---
Also, in massive world PvP, being able to summon DHKs is also stupid. 
---
The point of a DHK is to discourage killing certain NPCs. They aren’t there to grief a player that’s attacking you by instantly summoning a DHK for them.
---
You can only earned a certain amount of ranking points every week based on the honor you earned that week vs the server's pvp population. 
---
DHK's instantly make you lose those ranking points and I've heard it's exponential so someone at a high rank can lose weeks of progress grinding honor 12-18 hours a day.
---
Pen is a prefix to ultimate, and at no point is ultimate limited to a narrow understanding you're trying to argue here in order to use pen in front of it.
---
Whether we're talking about sequences in a process or sequences on a list, penultimate applies as a valid word. In this case it would be in reference to a list of worst to best dps specs.
---
I doubt they see themselves as being dicks, and they are having fun and probably see you as being a frail weak target, which you seemingly are. Do you go sit on the sidelines during a soccer match cause the other goalie wont let you score? Super dick moving not letting you have fun and score? Its a game, even if youre not scoring it can still be fun, its not a waste of time just cause you lose
---
*Sees you use the item*
---
*Takes aoe off bars*
---
*Camps you extra hard for being an exploiting punk*

I think I found a new purpose for the KOS list.

Free faction swap yes free Epic heeeeeell no

you lose RANK rating, not honor rating.  Big difference.

---
Shockadin isn't really a thing until bc, it's just too weak in vanilla. Having said that it's a game, have fun.
---
Lol, I’m not getting DHKs, and this isn’t PvE vs PvP. This thing can be summoned in BGs.
---
Netherwind isn't bad. Haven't run into any camping either so far. One kill and then usually move on. But maybe I am jinxing myself.
---
Skinning in UBRS is extremely lucrative. Once you reach the point where you have no upgrades from UBRS, drop the skinning.
---
Yea I didn't understand this in vanilla and thought tier pieces were best lol so my warlock I only went for tier pieces haha
---
I think the real issue is that the server populations are so much higher than they were. I played vanilla - cata always on a PvP server and I loved it. I liked getting killed because I was busy with a mob and then I come back and return the favor 4 times. Or maybe I get outplayed and I have to go do another quest for a bit.
---
I didn't even mind when the occasional max level player came and ganked for a bit. They were fun interruptions in an otherwise repetitive game.
---
I'm just not having fun in Classic though because there's Horde *everywhere*. I mean, I can't really blame them; they're all just farming honor and think they have a shot at Rank 14 and that's cute. It honestly can take over an hour to get to BRD though because there's enough Horde to have *groups* of them the entire way to the instance from flight paths on both sides.
---
On top of it, if I do manage to come to a situation where it's myself and one other person PvPing each other, there's *always* someone from one of our factions 50 yards away max to jump in and help. I haven't even mentioned the fact that on top of this there's enough Horde to camp inside of every one of the goblin cities.
---
From what I've read, Classic servers are hosting about 10x what vanilla servers did and I just don't think the game is balanced for that.
---
Farmed 3 days straight to get it for my hunter in vanilla. 
---
Went to do Ony attunement on my warrior in classic and two of them dropped while going through the cave and clearing to the back,  and waiting for the named dragon to respawn. No hunters in the group...
---
And you perpetuate it, you horrible, horrible person you.
---
"wah wah, didnt get loot so now i might quit. Btw i love classic". No you dont. Stop whining.
---
I just made a mage on this server last night!  Level 5...gosh.
---
Deep Woods/Serethil is a great combo for DPS, and Serethil is prebis for orc tanks, so you get extra value out of it.
---
Deep Woods is worth every penny. Prices are trending down right now because demand has dropped off. I've checked its price every day for a month and finally got one for 110g on the weekend. It procs all the time. I did 7000 nature damage over the course of my first strat live run with deep woods.
---
Yeah, blaming people for not enjoying getting perma-camped on imbalanced servers and saying shit like "lol, mad at pvp on a pvp server" is just likely to help drive even more imbalance by having those people quit, and reduce the longevity of the game overall. If people on the opposing faction can't enjoy the game, they're just going to stop playing and find something else to do.
---
They removed these types of add-ons on retail. Not sure if they exist for classic.
---
if only the 400 billion dollars that was taxed for fiber optic infrastructure throughout the US was actually done, instead of just being pocketed by telecom companies. Meanwhile south Korea spends 25 billion dollars several years ago and still has the fastest internet.

Tanking for money. Stealth runs in DME for herbs. Solo Mara and solo DM Tribute.

I thought this wasn't an acceptable response to alliance.
---
Oh right gotcha. It sucks that all the things I CAN use, ALL casters also want but that's the role I chose lol
---
Currently Alliance on Blaumeux and you're right. We are punks on this server. It feels like its horrendously unbalanced but then I'm in IF and there's so many people. Just completely unwilling to do anything about the gank squads. I'm really thinking about transferring but I don't know if it's even available anymore.
---
I don't know.  All I know is rogues stealth into the tower and murder people or do right outside of it, I would assume its proximity to Org keeps people flagged, i've seen people killed on the platforms waiting for the zeppelins.
---
How does an asmon kiddie know what of fortune were like?
---
Any links to this announcement?
---
It is all perspective, I do wish you luck on your travels.
---
I am running my first MC ever with my guild tonight.  What can I do to prepare? What are some potions or elixirs I should bring?  Level 57 Frost Mage
---
I always wonder the mental of people like you. I find it quite fascinating tbh.
---
Cause I was a dumbass and thought it was the think to do. Regardless the people you find in LFG are gonna be in SW or IF anyways
---
Cleave also scales off weapon damage and is probably your best rage dump when in a DPS role. Hamstring is better if you have windfury, heroic strike is better if you're tanking.
---
Why would I abandon my current friends/guild and go to a lesser/weaker faction ?  Free epic mount is fine to fix the problem.  Everyone can farm hard(40+ hours and get it). It just more encouraging. Also only allow one way factions change(to the weaker side ) ofc
---
False. I have 420 (big iron fishing pole, aqua dynamic fish attractor). I have fished up at least 20 essences over the last week while AFK farming. I need to pay for my epic mount somehow.
---
Good old Ouro. Best loot drama story in all of classic so far.
---
I do not use floating combat text. Is that something I should be using?
---
I just checked wowheads population and wowclassicpopulations data and we're closer to 60/40 with an activity peek of 3500 unique logins during the month of November. Not intended to say you're wrong, just providing the most up to date info possible. Great server as a whole from an alliance perspective anyway.
---
HOTW NS is a somewhat selfish spec but having a duel tank/healing spec feels pretty good. I don't see myself respecing anytime soon
---
I took a flight from IF to WP before vacation, but I logged out mid air in Arathi Highlands. After few days I logged back in and gryphon did 180°, took straight like into IF and from there it did the proper flight path into WP again.
---
Disagree. Those potions will always be in such a large demand, especially for AQ40/Naxx.

Night elf for kiting domination
---
why did you state the gender of a tranny?

&gt;Cheating
---
You are responsible for how you and your account are represented in the game world. Cheating in any fashion will result in immediate action. Using third-party programs to automate any facet of the game, exploiting bugs, or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating.
---
Exploiting other players is an equally serious offense. Scamming, account sharing, **win-trading**, and anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties.
---
Source: Blizzard's In-Game Code of Conduct
---
Cross faction collusion to trade kills to rank up is win trading, and explicitly mentioned to receive harsh penalties.
---
Why even post this? what message are you trying to get across that hasn't been said a thousand times? Yeah it sucks, I've got a 54 Horde rogue on sulfuras and I've been 54 for a week now cause leveling is impossible, but I love pvp and I'm still having a blast running around fighting 60s, but mostly i've been leveling an alt and leveling my main slowly.
---
but the real question is why play on a pvp server if you didnt want to pvp? go roll on a pve server and that will solve literally all of your problems.
---
The games not dying, either you don't enjoy it anymore which is fine, just stop playing. Or roll on a pve server and watch all of your complaints disappear
---
Well that's up to you. I like it because I like to see everything that is going on. However, if you have trouble keeping up with fast data while focusing on everything else that is going on then it is not for you.
---
An example is if I'm PVPing and I'm taking damage I can roughly calculate how much health I've lost in comparison to my max health without having to look at my health bar. Also, if I have a healer I can see how much I'm getting healed for and factor that in. The raw numbers help me determine when I can be aggressive or defensive.
---
I don't see many people (or any at all) saying it but have your DPS (melee &amp; ranged) pop their cooldowns at 68% (68% because you wanna give your self 2 GCD's for cooldowns) 
---
And burn her while she is walking backwards to the place she takes lift off at. Once she is up in the air, have the dps warriors dump their remaining rage into her and the rogues can follow her around and jump sinister strike while the ranged continue to nuke.
---
This is very important because it leads to a more controlled and quicker P2.
---
You can do this with a 40 man and basically skip P2 completely, I actually haven't had to deal with an Ony breath in 2 months because of it.
---
In p2 keep a mental note of all the people who are targetting by fireballs. If you're running a threat meter call out first fireball and ask the healers / casters to stack on the target to dump threat.
---
When she lands, stop all dps and let the OT or a warrior pick Ony up and head north.
---
Hahaha ha eat shit grieving cunts
---
Does anyone have any concrete answers on what the drop chance actually is?
---
Howcome I can start the felwood quest to get these? I remember doing part of it then removing it from my log but when I talk to the tauren girl it doesnt prompt the quest anymore :/
---
&gt;Plus how many you know who already have some crazy ass epics or blues they hardly done anything for? ... Yet rest of us normal folk run those dungeons 30,40,50+ times and never get them lol.
---
Because those other people aren't also there contributing to the run? Wow.
---
If the game is making you this salty, you probably should take a break.
---
Going higher isn't that bad as sometimes, particularly early, you will end up without enough rage to cancel.
---
By the power vested in me by my self-given user name, I deem you absolved of all past griefing sins.
---
Dude, so happy to know you found my comment! Yeah, we were two friendly dudes at our farmspots. Nowadays I am in Azshara farming nagas aswell as rich thorium x3

---
Like 90% of the problems on this subreddit can be solved by Rolling On A PVE server.
---
I just don't get the appeal of wpvp, I have seen nothing but endless complaints and misery... meanwhile I'm on PVE getting saved when I have 5% hp by some random horde that runs along and kills the mob im fighting and I'm in turn doing the same for them.
---
When I was a low-level in Wetlands a high-level horde let me follow them around and skin all the whelps they were killing.
---
I'm telling you it's way more enjoyable.
---
Just because the game tells us we are enemies does not mean we need to make each other's experiences completely miserable.
---
I would start by going here:

---
Pick a server that is balanced 50/50, or close to it. I am on a small server, and there are probably like 50 guilds with all the content on farm. You should be fine anywhere.
---

I’m kind of wondering about your mental as well reading that “woah is me” story
---
So you firmly believe that virtually the entire Thalnos Alliance quit in the space of 7 days?
---
You haven't responded to any of my other points either. Are you unable to?
---
Honor system was revamped in TBC and DHKs were removed.
---

Not bis, so not worth 100+g.   In that level range, on my reg rogue, I would’ve paid about 25g for it, but because it’s outclassed by others and it’s mace, I wouldnt go insane.

Yeah, guess my psychic powers really let me down.
---
If this is true I'm going to drop a dummy every time someone ganks me.
---
I'm not the one crying about not being able to easily "farm people."
---
I understand the concept of PvP. It's pretty douchey to exclusively fight players who can't fight back *because* they can't fight back. If I roll up on a roughly equal level player I'll pop on 'em, if it'd be completely one-sided I don't. I can always kill them when they're an actual threat later on.
---
Wonder how 3 pc blk drg and 2 pc devilsaur compares.
---
Links or it didn’t happen
---
id wager its about 1 mob kill worth, maybe 2
---
Which is why you gotta make sure, while aquiring pre raid BiS tank gear, you are ALSO getting BiS dps gear!
---
like nothing. its all mechanical. once you got the dodges behind the pillar its all easy. ingi shadowreflector is pretty much a must tho. i mean you can blink through the boss and jump right at the start down to hydroboss area, but will take way longer. but all in all only practice and some lil pots like shadow protection IF you catch a sacrifice and nature res to absorb one dot of the endboss + lesser invis pot to get out of fight at the last boos after the imps break the wall open.
---
That post is really outdated, but your best bet is: https://wowclassicpopulation.com/
---
Dig through activity to see how many concurrent players on each faction.
---
Yeah, if you’re looking for this, I might suggest getting redoubt, imp shield, and imp rf.   personal choice whether you want to do holy shock, or BoSanc.
---
Over time though, more and more people will quit.  We'll trend closer to those numbers.
---
Mega server is hands down &gt; dead server.
---
If you instalocked an ultra high pop day 1 server and didn’t leave after the initial queue’s, you fucked up
---
Hell yeah brother
---
My best guess is that it will get a lot better.
---
Right now, there are a lot of people who envision themselves as Rank 14 PvP. The majority of them will come to the realization that they're not the guy over time - in all likelihood, many of them have.
---
When BGs release, World PvP will become pointless for the purpose of honor. There simply isn't any realistic way for a World PvP'r to keep pace with the amount of honor you can generate in a BG.
---
The result? The only people left on the gank squads will be those for whom making others miserable - not in-game rewards - will be their sole motivation.
---
It's literally breaking the sub rule #4, and people are cheering.
---
Just get 1 pt into coex and use it with amplify. Pesky alliance trying to run away from you before giving you 4 kills for honor? Coex. Guy is mounted and ur in a grp? You dismount to use it while ur group runs him down

---
How’s she blinking around?
---
holy fk this is brutal lol
---
It's alllll relative. When I made a spriest alt in vanilla, I actually felt bad: there were all these Oh Shit situations I faced as a resto druid that were not even a big deal as a shadow priest -- and if a dps DID manage to kill themselves, I could rez them after combat! It made me realize what a terrible disservice I had done to all my dungeon groups that whole time just by being a druid.
---
As a rogue, I support your use of two weapons over a giant 2H that hits like a train.
---
Easy with the insults there, neckbeard.
---
I rolled horde because I had half a dozen friends roll horde and zero roll alliance. I’ve also never played Vanilla before so I had no idea horde, or indeed anyone, would be the dominant faction. Apologies, I didn’t realize I was supposed to read Reddit for hours and then roll on the faction none of my friends played in order to keep some rando like you happy.
---
Let me ask you the same question: you clearly abhor PvP servers and think they’re fundamentally broken. This is a 15 year old game that Blizzard expressly promised to not change in the way you want it changed. Why the hell did you roll PvP instead of PvE to begin with? You a masochist?
---
Judging by all the speed run videos I've seen, 15+ fury DPS warriors, 10 healers, 2 tanks, the rest doesnt matter.
---
Cool!  Thanks for the advice!  Great to hear from someone who did it!
---
This is correct. 600 is closer to ideal. I'm lacking 2 t1 parts, got t2, benediction + 55hp, crafting chest, head and leg enchant of dm and a green wand +13 HP and I am over 700 HP. Benediction + 55 HP alone are ~100 HP plus.
---
So it is really that simple? Thanks haha

Unless it’s so recent that it hasn’t even hit wowhead news yet, there’s been no confirmation of TBC. They’ve only said it was a possibility.
---
Yeah he flasking every time is goes into molten core with full consumes and world buffs. If you are not doing those things hit doesn’t matter nearly as much.
---
Someone on my server got a warning first for doing it.
---
I doubt I could find it again but I remember a video of something flying away from a shadow bolt on a 280% mount.  Can’t remember if it ever caught up
---
That's true, because then one of your tanks is going far past a safe amount of stacks.
---
Ungoro is not a leveling hub. Everlook is not a leveling hub. Stfu.
---
Name 3.
---
Yes, each equip slot has a [number](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment_slot) and you just use the number.
---
I didn't. I signed up on one of the relief servers spun up day of or day before. I've had one 20-minute queue one day and that's it.
---
My guild already has 20+ of these things farmed ready to pop on our run into BRM.  Cant wait to see the salt in the realm discord when the assembled group wipes us and gets their honor bombed.  The tears are going to be so delicious.
---
Uhhh auto hot key is used for a ton of stuff besides botting dude
---
You’re a little unhinged and very uneducated.
---
Did they quit too?
---
I did fury up to 31ish when I got ww axe, then arms to about 48 and back to 2h. Fury felt much better and had significantly less downtime (or at least felt like it)
---
Isn't honor stats not being shown properly still?
---
Oooooo I know exactly what your talking about from videos. I would really like that, as I don’t find it effective to look at the top left of my screen to check health. Thank you kind sir!
---
Ahhh so you don’t kill the last boss then? You use invis pots to escape? I was about to say I am a fully geared tank and he beats the shit out of me haha, that makes more sense
---
This is such a good comment lmao
---
Fear ward is a priest skill
---
Again, you are using a subjective term to make an objective statement.
---
You're such a fucking loser lmao
---
What racials do the elephants have?
---
Yeah alliance outnumbers us on my server and we have to play the 30 minute corpse run game to enter MC/BRD etc. Not a horde specific thing. Imbalance problem.
---
Why is this marked as "Humor / Meme"? This is how it is right now.
---
Meh, u had to be rank 1 in a bracket atleast. So its not like everyone got it.
---
This honestly stressed me out.
---
My interface is ElvUI, but I have some parts disabled, like bag frames &amp; raid frames, and I have a bunch of other random crap added.
---
Raid frames are Plexus, [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/plexus](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/plexus)

---
Oh wow, look! They all came back!
---
So in the space of a 2 weeks it goes from 28% to 4% to 23%.
---
Yeah, clearly census is totally reliable.
---
The bis list I use doesn't even have woods axe top 5 for tanking. Off the top my head I think it goes annhiliator, tooth of eranikus, bone slicing hatcher, serathil, ice blade hacker
---
I might have rolled a dwarf, but I'm a troll at heart.
---
Which server, if there aren’t queues then you have a pop similar or lower than mine and it’s completely fine on my server, 3 corpse runs or less per instance
---
Edited: thanks.
---
Players have no control over the server population. You might start on a low pop server and that server gets transfers from other servers, or you start on high pop servers and people leave to another server....no control there
---
Anyway I didn't mean that kind of overpopulation. They increased the server capacity without taking into account other things.
---
How do you zoom out that far?
---
Congrats?
---
Wow actually? If so, ive got some craftimg to do.
---
The gates open themselves after enough time passes, even if players don't participate.
---
Human racials are some of the best for tanks in PvE  
---
Gnome racials are among the best in PvE for casters  
---
Dorf priests get Fear Ward  
---
Salv+Kings from pallies
---
Yeah pretty much, Paladins are great. Blessing of Salvation, so you never have to watch threat again.
---
The notion that Horde has better PVP racials is just misinformation repeated over and over by bad players. The actual MOST hardcore PVPers will (and have) roll alliance, for a number of compounding factors that revolve around the nature of how group PVP works:
---
\- Paladins provide a much greater benefit to groups than their Shaman counterparts
---
\- As a result, when you roll Alliance your choice is either Gnome or Dwarf. The racials seem like nothing special at first, but break it down:
---
 \- WOTF and Hardiness are amazing for duels, you definitely get "your money's worth" out of these racials in 1v1 scenarios. In group PVP, however, you are actually NOT getting hit with fears or stuns as often as you might think (there are few classes that have access to these abilities, and a lot of these classes will hardly be pushing that far forward in a group fight to actually land a fear/stun because they in turn would get focused, CC'd, or just outright 1 shotted)
---
\- Priests, a staple class of classic PVP, have access to stoneform, desperate prayer, and fear ward when they roll dwarf. The benefit of these racials in group PVP far outweighs the benefit of WOTF on horde priests.
---
\- Gnomes and Warriors, two other absolute staple classes, have access to Escape Artist. This is a 1minute CD and gets used in situations SO MUCH MORE OFTEN than WOTF/Hardiness.
---
There is a bit more background that would exemplify why Alliance is the better faction for PVP, but I hope this is sufficient to at least make you question why people just parrot the same nonsense over and over again, when it simply is not true.
---
Well, you could also add to the list that alliance have different raid metagame to horde, casters are way better on alliance than they are on horde, due to paladins.
---
While horde have a slight melee advantage due to windfury totem.
---
Also, unfortunately a lot of people might be expecting TBC to be the classic expansion, and therefore they picked horde to save themselves a reroll/faction transfer later on.
---
Escape artist...
---
Nice man, I cant really remember what I ended at but I think it was around 2200ish... I only played 2v2, likely you and I ran into each other. What server did u play? I was Odel, a human warrior on Kel'Thuzad alliance.
---
Imagining it happening to alliance and coming here to see the same people cheering in this thread whining in another.
---
Imagine bitching about pvp on a pvp-server. I suggest you adapt to the new meta #nochanges
---
I think russian servers are 80% alliance still cuz idk why
---
If there was an extremely exploitable mechanic that existed in classic but was never exploited because no one knew about it, it should be fixed.
---
He was better than gallowboob at least.
---
Like the millions of other posts mentioning it, BGs will be cross realm so hardly a difference in queue times across factions
---
I work with this company called Amway that you may be interested in investing in, pm me for details.
---
Yeah autohotkey can be against TOS depending on how you use it, I don’t use it for WoW at all. That’s my point. It has a community entirely unrelated to botting. 
---
ISBoxer is exclusively for input broadcasting and window management. It provides no tools for botting at all. Out of the box, it is *incapable* of providing the ability to automate. You would need additional 3rd party code to create an agent capable of converting input from the world into actions.
---
more like ganker vs afk player
---
Did scholo last night with a paladin tank, two priests (heals/shadow dps) and a mage/rogue on DPS. 
---
No wipes and cleared everything including the paladin quest.
---
Something tells me this would make a Great wepp for a troll Hunter. You could regain so much hp while kiting 🤩
---
You did read the part where he said "according to some of their guildmates", right? This shit used to happen all the time in VN and even BC days... Campers getting camped and quitting, town-raiders getting ported across the world by GMs as punishment for excessive camping, Barrens chat before it became "PG"... Those were the days.
---
Wow I think we found the only person ever to use apples news app
---
When BGs first drop I bet you wont wait longer then 3 minutes.
---
Do you have numbers? Math? In a 40 man raid assuming top performers each role is BoK 10% al l stats better than windfury in dps groups and chain heal spam? I dont actually know im just looking for proof lol.
---
People go 2h fury in PvE because it doesn’t take up a debuff slot on the boss. I think the DPS is comparable though.
---
They’ll be cross realm.  So individual server ratios won’t matter as much as the overall balance or whatever the balance is if they do battle groups
---
In PvP resto/balance is one of the best 1v1 specs. Just check out the duel tournament.
---
Who are they going to farm? Alliance will have instant BG queues from major cities. Raids will roll out together on raid day.
---
Legit the only alliance you’ll see in the world are alts, solo gatherers, raid groups, and specialized small PvP groups with full consumes/engi/tryharding. It’s gonna be pretty rough for horde honor farming if they have even 20minute queues.
---
Steelbloom is also worth a fair bit on my server (Whitemane)
---
Paladins really only need 21 points in holy to be effective dungeon healers as long as you maintain a seperate set of healing gear. The other 30 points are yours to play with on whatever hybrid spec you'd like.
---
Mages are definitely the new huntards.
---
Sure,  and that would be awesome.   It's just kind of like Russian roulette when pvp server opens.   Which server are you?
---
Omg the scene from super snacks 2 makes so much more sense now!
---
I'm going to convince my guild to farm UD strat for the eye, and then we can have some fun taking the boat to onyxia next reset.
---
It will probably be quite fast at first, especally the AV queue as everyone wants to be exalted with those factions.
---
After that they will probably reach a massive hault, as a lot of people aren't interested in BGs, and thats when the corpse camping will continue.
---
People who wants to efficiently farm honor just puts their HS in Kargath or wherever they like to camp, and then they just hearthstone after re-quing everytime they are done with a BG.
---
Queue + playing a BG should be more than an hour most of the time.
---
Haha, the drama around ranking is worth it.
---
This kinda depends. IIRC, the "bosses" of the Elemental Invasions were the sources of the Aces, but I don't remember if that was true on release of the events or added later. You might be able to grind for a load of Aces on the 10th, then make some trades to finish your deck of choice once all the cards start dropping.
---
You dont get it. Exploiting is OK as long as you are 'oppressed'. You know, like how minorities cant be racists... and women cant be sexist. It's just, like, the rules.
---
To be fair, I've never felt the need to say I earned Rival title back in wotlk
---
Shrug.  I’m geared.  I can heal you to full with a r2 heal and a r3 renew.  I can drink to full faster than you can heal via bandages.
---
I have this discussion every few days with a guildie warlock XD
---
There's 40 people in these RAIDs so having 3 epics over that period isn't horrible.
---
We've been going since early November / end of October and I only have gotten two epics from MC (boots/bracers) and my helm from Ony so far (I'm a Warlock).  You just have to Raid to have fun and the gear will come.  The luck comes and goes.
---
We have had a running joke in guild about how much Warlock and Druid gear (we have two Druids and they are basically 8/8 now) has been dropping.  Last week in MC there was literally no Warlock gear that dropped - and we have eight of us.  Some weeks you get gear and other weeks you don't.  It's just how it goes.  It comes with being a raider so you can either enjoy and hope to get one at some point or if it's stressing you out this much take a break.
---
I wish you luck on your adventures!
---
Horde owns brm alliance owns most of the world
---
Salvation alone puts alliance solidly ahead of horde. An instant 30% increase to the threat ceiling is monstrous and no horde specific ability is even close to being as good in PVE.
---
People have a bad case of "eff it its an upgrade"....  Not giving a single shit about whether or not its BiS for anyone else....   I'm guilty too, but it does seem more prevalent this play through.  I feel your pain tho, we've been clearing for about the same time, and I have my T2 head.  That is all....  Haven't even had a chance to lose Mageblade to our Paladin core, or Staff of Dom to a Lock yet.....
---
Cursing in trade chat isn’t even against the rules
---
What does "GZ" mean when I level up in a group? At least thats what I think people were saying to me.
---
I was arms lvl 10-60,hamstring kiting every mob I could, then I specced fury for raid and I feel like a literal gimp. I miss my 2h so much :( 
---
Dw is for my rogue damnit!!

Theres another quest where a sickly Tauren is sent by the  TAUREN CHIEFTAIN to be healed by a Forsaken apothecary. Instead of healing, the apothecary has you gather a bunch of shit to run experiments on the Tauren, pretty much trying to brew a a new plague. 
---
The quest ends with you poisoning the Tauren (after hearing something about her being eager to return home after being away for so long) and the apothecary happy with the results.
---
Yeah that quest made me feel like the Forsaken don't really give a shit about the Horde
---
POGGERS
---
What epl and dire maul are alliance only since day one of phase 2 o.o
---
Chain sheeping to stop a heal, like did you think AT ALL before you typed that ?
---
They did encourage people to roll on lower population realms.
---
Sulfuras is mega horde dominated lololol. You clearly haven’t had the joy of corpse running into BRM from Thorium Point. THAT server either has spineless alliance or a severe faction imbalance. You think horde get ganked on a PvP server. That’s cute. For real
---
If you're choosing who you want to run the axe for the debuff, then it means something.  
---
Do you want to put it on something like a hunter and get better uptime but basically no dps?  Do you put it on a paladin and get decent uptime and mediocre dps?  Or do you put it on a warrior and get slightly less uptime but somewhat competitive DPS?
---
No reason not to have that as an overarching goal, but at 166 healing, there are better milestones which are more easily accomplished than a blanket "get 600 healing", I think. He can get everything I recommended in my standalone before his next raid with steady play. 600 healing is going to take at least two to three weeks, if he's lucky with drops.
---
I personally wouldn't drop a +55 enchant on HoG, the mats are better spent toward getting Truefaith first, or at least a Hide, because then there are no upgrades after that for chest or back. That's how I approached it, though, and situations do differ (and server economies).
---
If you're rolling in gold and mats (like I managed after some freakish "eye of shadow" drops), then yes. Or if essence/shards are going for 5g or less.
---
Cross realm....yes...what horde fail to realize is that they have a 8/9 server dominance...and thinking pve servers will balance it...boy they are in for a surprise....horde are in denial
---
&gt;7 months is like half way between fall of Rome and tomorrow in the internet time.

---
"OK Alliance, how do we win at PvP?"
---
"I've got it! We exploit PvE!"
---
"Johnson, you're a genius"
---
Paladin buffs are huge for PvE. 33 MP5, 185 attack power, 24 dmg reduction, 30% threat reduction, and +10% stats for everyone in your raid.
---
Depends which of the high pop horde realms gets put in the same battelgroup as Heartseeker, I think.
---
Its short for congratulations.
---
Congrats &gt; Grats &gt; Gz
---
&gt;They increased the server capacity without taking into account other things
---
Do you have an estimation on a current servers capacity and how full are they? Like, a number?
---
I see i see. Salvation is like tranquil air for whole raid? Just need refresh every 10min?
---
That's bs  it almost feels alliance favored depending on where you are
---
Ghetto hs from rfc.
---
Except it's not the traditional experience. Back to pservers for you.
---
Plenty of flight points being camped prior to phase 2 dropping, especially thorium point, but also places like Azshara. There were gank squads roaming around EPL too.
---
I don't know what it benefits you to pretend these things weren't happening in phase 1.
---
I don't agree with PvE advantage... what is it?  We have Pallys but Horde have Shaman - they aren't exactly the same but by no means is it an advantage.
---
Always cool to see Druid pvp videos. In my personal opinion it's the hardest caster due to how badly it can be screwed my mana mismanagement and having no real big killmove, extending all multitarget fights compared to other classes 1vX.
---
It's already sad af that people are willing to put in that grind in the first place in Classic.
---
To have something like this completely negate a shitload of progress would be catastrophic for someone who realizes that the last day or two of farming (or more at higher ranks I believe) was for absolutely nothing-- because I certainly doubt no lifing is very fun in the moment.
---
Plate of the Shaman king, magma tempered boots, and Gallant's wrist-guards. The bracers don't have strength or stam but I'm gonna reach because that's honestly the only plate healing gear I can think of that's not paladin tier gear.
---
It was intended for people to camp people in neutral zones  and flight paths?
---
The wowhead post was from September, so yeah a bit out of date. Lots of people rely on just straight up census information, but that doesn't always tell the full story. What everyone needs to look at is concurrent players, as there's a ton who just raidlog. That doesn't tell you how many people are actually running around the world to encounter.
---
Enjoy!
---
21/0/0
---
That'll handle 5-man healing just fine. So you've got options.
---
Holy+prot with healing gear is your strongest option for PvP (as a group support). Some like going heavy holy for holy shock, others like going up to reckoning in prot (and possibly higher). So that could be 31/20, 20/31 or somewhere inbetween.
---
21/0/30 is another option. It's honestly pretty bad for PvP, but if you've still got some questing and stuff to do in the world, it's the better option.
---
yes, when you get him down to like 45-50% he spawns the imps, the you jump on a lil specific ledge and spam invis pot and get out of combat and loot your hard earnd ore :D
---
are you writing "safespotting" in your ticket or something like "exploiting terrain"
---
Correct, and there's no range restriction like there are for shaman totems.
---
Tl dr,
---
Fix: Grind battlegrounds rep
---
That comes from alliance ganking everyone in epl felwood tanaris feralas etc
---
This would be awful. Why not just invite bots and gold sellers directly
---
Pallys bring salvation to reduce threat and tremendous ST healing throughput for tank healing.
---
Humans bring sword spec, which to my knowledge, some of the best weapons are swords.
---
Dwarf priests bring fear ward
---
Those all seem really strong for alliance PvE
---
Holy shit ya’ll need to switch detergent charmin making you soft
---
He's BS specced.
---
BC sucks fuck flying give us classic plus.
---
Don't know what that addon did apart from marking spawn locations, but if you're content with only that function, then you can add coordinates to TomTom. All of them are listed on a wowhead guide about Felwood stuff AFAIK.
---
&gt; so I joined a raid group and hunted down anything that was red for the rest of the night.
---
This is kinda the point and what made PvP so freaking cool! There were entire wars waged because of hillsbrand ganking, sadly now most people would rather solo or sit in the cities and whine instead of....pvping
---
Well gg no wonder alliance parses are real good.
---
The main problem is most guilds I've talked to don't really want to coordinate for pvp with each other, especially with guilds like Yang Gang and Goon Squad. A few guilds (including my own) made a joint pvp discord to coordinate, but nothing really came of it.
---

---
Flatland Cougars prowl right at the base of the elevator to Thunder Bluff.
---
Arms DPS blows for PvE raiding.
---
there is nothing to improve. it's a recreation of Vanilla with a much larger player base with a few changes like putting in overhauled talents and buffed gear too early.
---
&gt; Horde have a distinct PVP advantage
---
Only in unorganised/skirmish PvP with zero consumables. In co-ordinated PvP (and this is with complete disregard for classes such as Paladins/Shamans) Alliance have the advantage because consumables/items are available that are equivalent, if not outright to superior to the various horde Racials but there is no equivalency to the Alliance variants
---
+ Orc Stun resist vs Free Action Potion
---
+ WotF vs Glimmering Mithril Insignia (as an anti-fear mechanic)
---
+ etc.
---
In a world where the 'norm' is to be supplementing your character with additional item usage (e.g. Engineering grenades) and thus it's a given to assume your opponents aren't going to bat an eye about consumables/additional resource expenditure (and the relatively short duration of PvP engagements when it matters) having an item that does everything a passive racial would (if not more) for as long as the engagements could have a meaningful outcome is more than enough to nullify the value of said racials.
---
Too late. But seriously, there needs to be a Warcraft/WoW anime or manga
---
ok?
---
Few questions on the cancelaura commands. Is it a bug that causes the need to cancel them? And will it be fixed?
---
And PS doesn’t show as a buff. Is it still active regardless?
---
that wasnt iceblock, hunter put trap. and he showed the item which mindcontrols, gnomish engineering
---
get in que. pvp in menthil harbor while u wait.
---
You don't need to click twice, you just need to not click during a global cooldown.
---
Killed the game for me
---
eh, idk about this bro. i was vehemently opposed to how pvp was set up, then i started doing it, and have come to respect my foes, this seems fucked up.
---
&gt; Tell me all about how you use boxing and botting software to NOT box and bot in a game with fully supported macros and mouse over commands already in client. Get specific. 
---
and you reply:
---
&gt; I don’t use it for WoW at all. That’s my point. It has a community entirely unrelated to botting.
---
This was fun. Nice talk, champ.
---
The thing is I have 3 minor upgrades for my gear (not counting Dal Rends). I don't wanna list all the gear, so I'll say I have 350dps in the spreadsheet. I think only elixir of giants as an extra buff. What's yours? Sure with full bis+every single buff possible (DM included) it's 999 but I don't plan to prepare for 8 hours before a raid xd
---
I would stop camping neutral cities, but i was told to make no changes.
---
Royals (purple being a color of royalty)
---
Roger (for male)
---
Denise (for female)
---
Ray Charles (for the stealth part, since he cannot be seen)
---
Purple Rocket (instead of Red Rocket, works only for a male, but in this day and age it could work for both genders I guess)
---
Get the flag then kill their flag
---
Yeah guy, everyone in this thread will be 'doing the quest'. Come back to reality.
---
nah dude this fresh is still good.
---
If you think this is even a small exaggeration then that is sad. For several weeks the path to BRD has been exactly this, 40v1 with not one second of rest at 5am or any other time, i checked. Alliance players know this.
---
You are horde, and so you have lived your little sheltered baby life and you come here and criticize me and tell me I'm wrong, that is unbelievable and if I werent so disgusted I would laugh. Keep your ignorant criticism to yourself, your horde version of wow is a lovely rainbow fairy land compared to that of your victims
---
Well, I can't imagine I need to be *full* prot for LBRS. People tank it DPS spec all the time, even with sub-par gear. I just might need to wait until 60 to do that, not sure.
---
I'm 44 now, so just started branching out from Fury.
---
I have to admit I haven't done it yet, no time :( but they were following tirion on a horse, wouldn't it fail if they died?

It works now.
---
Phase 2 is slowly killing it
---
Killing Ony every five days since early October: 6 times in October, 6 times in November.  That means 12 kills max. Not sure how you got to 40+ Ony kills.
---
Fuck TBC.
---
I've played it recently on pserver, because I was one  of the fools who used to think TBC was actually a good expansion.
---
People like to complain about min-maxing and griefing in vanilla, they have absolutely no idea what would await them if they want to take classic down that dark path.
---
Its shit
---
August 19. Things have changed since then.
---
IMO this seems like an exploit to me and should probably be fixed.  It's only use is also just straight up malice so it might even warrant a small ban or at least a warning.  Anyone who gets caught by it should have their DHKs removed.
---
2H Arms destroys dungeons 40-50ish. Charge&gt;Zerk Stance&gt;Zerk Rage&gt;MS&gt;Whirlwind&gt;Sunders/more WW

This has been my rotation and I’m top DPS most of the time
---
You're unfamiliar with IT professionals having plenty of time to browse reddit while they're getting paid?
---
This is the answer. The more you think about it the more you are putting out that vibe of "i wont get it". You gotta just sit back and not care. RNGesus will respond in due course.
---
I got the SGC and Foror's super fast, and I like to think its cause I went in with 0 attachments and 0 expectancy of getting them. Was just running for shits and giggles basically. When I ran dungeons repeatedly for 1 piece, that's when it took forever to get (and 30+ runs in I still haven't gotten rends bracers).
---
No, only random dungeon gear, mostly from ah and DMT

Paladin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shaman support.

My friend and I cheesed hemo rogue+resto druid in 2s all the way to 2.4k and made glad back when cyclone + sap + blind cycle was imbalanced. We weren't even good at all. We'd lose to actually good holy pal/arms war combos all the time.
---
It's not totally impossible. Then again, I feel like I've been learning that everyone acts like they were in a top guild and hot shit when they talk about WoW in other games (RIFT, FFXIV, etc)
---
Christ... has it been that long?  
---
Ugh... I remember in high school hearing about this new thing called "reddit". I also remember getting my first smartphone Nokia Lumia 500, when I was 18. Hell... I remember when this new niche thing called "Youtube" started...
---
You mean FIX phase 2
---
yes its a civ, no its not a dhk. tested and it doesnt work
---
Also our rogues are so much better geared than us fury warriors are that they have 2x more dps on every boss lmao, I was highest warr on rag last week, still pretty crap tho :(
---
Agree, but if they're leaving this awful PVP system in the game they may as well leave the only way t combat it in the game also
---
I ran 2h fury for quite awhile leading up to P2 and going arms. 2h fury is a lot better than arms. Arms has its moments in trash fights but just doesn’t have the same consistent damage that 2h fury does. 
---
Also, I’m alliance and at first I could keep up with the dw fury guys but I started seeing myself falling behind as we got more geared.
---
Onyxia's fear doesn't do that.
---
Gatorade
---
It impacts your current rating. In other words, you will lose some rating immediately.  You might notice that there is a green bar at the top of your honor page.  That will go down after a DK.
---
&gt; thinking pve servers will balance it...boy they are in for a surprise  
---
funny how many people don't realize the reality of this
---
If its the escort, Tirion will just solo the quest.
---
Like, you are probably worse of if you are doing anything, as you will just get aggro, pull extra shit or die.
---
The best way is to just AFK and let Tirion handle it (or his son).
---
30% threat reduction is huge. There are classes that historically have to spec into worse builds (warlock as an example), to avoid pulling aggro off the tank in raids. This isn't as big of an issue until scaling gets crazier with better gear in the later phases.
---
So it severely punishes those asshole who gank people 20v1. Nice.
---
Yes, that’s a fair amendment.
---
I think the proof lies in the experience of a bunch of store hardcore players. 
---
I'm by no means that hardcore or experienced myself, but have gotten a clear understanding of alliance being the better PvE faction. The threat gap provided by the threat reduction blessing, in combination with the extra threat generated by human warriors with swords, along with healers that just go on and on, appears to be a bigger advantage than melee dealing more damage - but potentially getting threat capped. This is especially true later in the game when casters start pulling some serious damage, and therefore being threat capped. 
---
For PvP I can't say what's best, but I can say that I don't believe APES would be going alliance over and over if there was a truly significant disadvantage. 
---
I think it's pretty much that most players think horde had the advantage, but that the most experienced (that tend to not necessarily share all info) know that alliance are actually better. 
---
Again, I'm not myself anywhere near that level, I've just been on the forums and been reading guides for long enough to have gotten that impression.
---
The 3% hit of the warmonger apply. It’s a very useful first weapon to reach the hit cap. 
---
I use an add on that calculates the hit and other stats. Extended Character Stats
---
Some people dont care about a downgrade in service quality others wonder why a volunteer group that charged 0$ provided a better experience.
---
I know that song from somewhere. What is that from?
---
Frodo and crew could really have benefited from this
---
It’s a priest ability but it is specific to dwarves
---
You have to toggle both but it’s not really an issue if you’re dungeon farming
---
Hahahahaha not bannable at all. This is how the game should be, aoe sapper fights are lame and apes are a bunch of virgins
---
Yep. Unless it specifically states spell hit, it applies to melee and ranged.
---
Yeah I’ve done that to the horde because of the atrocities I’ve been apart of. Everyone dies now, no mercy.
---
I have the In Dreams ring and have been hitting UBRS multiple times over the past week, mostly to get to attuned for Onyxia.  My main goal was getting to 60 and worrying about specific drops later.  I've done a few runs for the second wind trinket but he seems to favor just dropping the boots.  Have the book but haven't run over to DM yet.  I'll be working on my gear this week heavily.  Getting enough time for dungeon runs has been an issue for me though.
---
Honestly the few I've had in my dungeons have been better than 90% of pugs I deal with because people playing the rarer specs tend to be more invested, more serious, and pay more attention when really 90% of the difficulty of a dungeon is making sure your group is actually paying attention (feels very rare that my groups struggle with actual numbers like single target threat or DPS)
---
*Whole guild gets banned*
---
sure, except that it's like a .05% drop rate, so good fuckin luck getting it. 
---
but if ya do, and ya wanna spend a bunch of money/time getting good +heal cloth gear, and take up bag space to have a full second set of gear, then yeah, you'll be a pvp beast if you're half good.
---
"Oh, shit!"  - Ma Su
---
Yeah that’s just dumb and not at all related to this mechanic.
---
Great points, upvoted. Would you care to weigh in on pve? Sactuary threat reduction outweigh horde racials and WF?
---
The enchant is more valuable than quite a few prebis pieces. Worth the 2-4 hour farm. A lot pieces pieces took me that just to upgrade them.
---
I was afraid Arms wouldn’t be able to keep up with the raw dps potential of Fury, but i would rather stay arms if I can.  So thats good to know, thanks!
---
Everyone has reported it as a bug, but it hasn't made it to an official "working as intended" or "Definate bug" list that I'm aware of.
---
I don't personally know, but People that did extensive testing say that it is a hidden buff  and it's effects disappear and reappear just like the visible Buff "leader of the pack".
---
&gt; You want significant changes to wow, clearly. So why are you playing wow classic, a 15 year old game that the community has overwhelmingly requested zero changes for.
---
No i don't. I said I wondered what it would be like. That's not the same as advocating for changes. You seem really worked up, are you ok? 
---
&gt; Why are you playing a PvP server at all?
---
I like emergent pvp fights. I don't like multi-person 60-level gank squads camping me while I try to quest. If there's a server that lets me have both of those things, let me know Mr. Snarkypants. 
---
&gt;  I’m the one enjoying world PvP, you’re the one complaining about it and asking that it be changed, then insulting anyone who points out how terrible your ideas for change are. Clearly you need to either take a break or reroll on PVE.
---
You have poorly comprehended my posts if you think I'm asking for it to be changed and insulting anyone who points out my ideas for a change are bad. You correctly stated a flaw with my pondering and that was the end of that. I'm not sure why you got your panties in such a wad over it. Maybe you need to take a break from these forums?
---
Can confirm, Atiesh NA is great!
---
Private servers rarely had the option for PvE, so prior to Classic's launch I had spent like 4 years or so on PvP servers. I knew *exactly* what it was going to be like for Classic. I'd had enough corpse camping bullshit to last me a lifetime, and I wanted to play Alliance after all those years of rolling Horde for safety. I don't miss it at all. There's always a big battle happening at Southshore. The tedium of grinding is a good enough reason to form friendships and community. I don't feel like I'm receiving a lesser experience, and I've never had to quit playing over being camped.
---
Well, good luck then.
---
Heartseeker is a lot smaller than the high pop horde dominated realms.
---
Except this couldn’t be more wrong. Horde outnumber alliance across all of classics population by a pretty decent chunk.
---
Horde will have significantly longer q times
---
While alliance will get murdered out In open world.
---
It’s a trade off I suppose
---
Not much Unbuffed I’m 215-285 dps. crusader enchants on Krol blade and mirahs song, sticking to swords because of human racial. I only take about 6 elemental sharpening stones, Elixir of mongoose and fire water. And the only buff I receive outside of raidgroup is the onyxia headbuff and I’m usually 1-6 top dps for
---
My raid team. It’s only going to get better the more geared we get.
---
Nobody even mentioned warrior specifically.
---
Lmao I just replied to another comment about the atrocities I’ve been apart of and now every horde is KoS, no mercy. 
---
For real though, everyone I play with doesn’t give a fuck anymore because yes both sides are filled with ass holes but one of them has way more ass holes.
---
Actually I was describing both and how they can happen to both factions. Sorry you’re having a different experience. Best of luck out there.
---
Ya we would charge people 1000g to carry them to get their season weapons. Never did it for the titles tho.
---
I was Last Ascension!
---
We were roving yesterday so we do come out of the woodworks when we can.
---
I will say that WPL/EPL was the best, however there was another alliance raid roving too, so it was a far cry from the usual "land and die" scenario.
---
BRM was a different story, raids of horde rolled through every few minutes. It was kinda ridiculous. In Felwood / Winterspring we encountered a few groups which was nice. Then we went to the DM entrance and at first it looked like it was going to be fun, like 10 v 10, then out of nowhere 20 more showed up.  
---
So yes, the alliance occasionally muster up a response. If the horde want to though, they definitely can lay a steamroll.
---
Soul link
---
I was in Last Ascension on Agamaggan. I remember those guild names very well haha.
---
They're petty cause they aren't allowed to run BRD 
---
tbh if i sucked as bad as the alliance in this game at PVP this is the sorta stuff i'd probably be doing too
---
The target dummy thing is massive. If that’s true they need to hotfix immediately.
---
sometimes that's how it be
---
The server I recently transferred from even had horde raids camping redridge.
---
I wish I could buy you a drink, absolute legend.
---
Guaranteed
---
The current experience is very little reminiscent of vanilla wow, likely largely due to the fact that there's 10x as many players on most servers as the server cap from classic.
---
Back in Vanilla, there were occasional 60's ganking leveling zones, but nothing like the current status where there's raids of 60's ganking everyone in pretty much every high-level zone, and many lower level zones. Hillsbrad was famous because it's where people went to have large scale fights to get honor- there weren't raids of people trying to farm level 55's in Everlook or Marshall's Refuge.
---
The current toxic behavior that you seem to be espousing is just driving people away from the game, and will kill the game for all of us. Blizzard is largely to blame, both in ignoring the outcomes of trying to cram too many people on each server without doing anything to mitigate the downsides, as well as not doing anything to better balance the factions so most servers are lopsided. However, the attitude that people should just constantly get killed in lopsided fights and enjoy it just means that those people are just going to quit the game or transfer off.
---
Yes we need more fake novellas
---
Summon pet. Mind control. Macro attack pet + cancel-MC to spellbatch the target into not being your pet, while also not canceling the attack.
---
The above is a way to counter exploit the scared alliance who are afraid of wpvp. Have at it!
---
In felwood there is a cave near the satyrs. Go through it and on the other side is a big area with tons of satyrs to grind that also drop fel cloth that no one really ventures to.
---
Try to target raids. Everyone in a raid who is in the general areawill get a DK.
---
There's a reason it has 2k subs.
---
It has been working for a while now. Instead of running automatically in the background, they changed it to run a who request whenever the player clicks the ui or interacts with the 3d world. It was only broken for a few weeks.
---
Um, blizzard?
---
Everybody has always disliked multiboxers that compete with other players, so for PVP. For PVE though, it can be pretty impressive to see how it all works out. It is completely allowed by blizzard because money.
---
If it doesn't force you to do extra lifetaps, spamming shadowburn is still a minor DPS increase.
---
I had one long ago, but didn't bookmark it. I'll see if I can find it. Lorerunner talks about it in his WoW Lorerun, if anyone knows who that is, but to my knowledge he doesn't provide a definitive source for it.
---
This can't really affect you if you're not running the addon. Private chat rooms are already rate-limited to prevent you from causing too much spam on the server. If it was possible to lag an entire server by spamming data into chat, then people would already be doing it just to grief the servers. 
---
If the addon is lagging you, it's likely because it's constantly churning the data syncing between players. If that's the case, just uninstall the addon.
---
Yeah tbh I wish I rolled a rogue xD
---
1 DK = -500 HK
---
so yeah. don't do it.
---
I would like to play on a PvP Server with the ruleset of phase 1:
---
* You wont get any honor by killing anyone in the open world. 
---
* The only way to rank up in the pvp system would be battlegrounds.
---
To me, that servertype would be the best of the two worlds: fighting for farmspots, questmobs and nodes, but without the openworld honorgrind that isnt satisfying for most of the horde and absolultly broken for the alliance (for  most of pvp servers).
---
I dont want to play on a PvE Server, mostly because of the lack of fighting for ressources, therefore I will stay on my PvP Server, hoping BGs will solve part of the problem. Untill then I level low-level characters and try to make money from the auctionhouse. If nothing changes, I will raidlog untill my sub runs out and return for TBC, if it ever is released.
---
Even assuming that the data on there is 100% accurate. It’s almost 3 months old at this point.
---
Go look at how logs there are on Warcraft logs for horde vs alliance it’s not even close
---
Want more proof? Look at pvp ranking standings across horde and alliance. Almost every server has way more people participating on horde than alliance once again pointing to the fact that horde continues to have more played active.
---
All the above + the fact that alliance populations across all PVP servers have been dwindling day by day due to the state of the world
---
I know it’s hard to accept that you’re going to have long ass queues as horde but it’s the price you gotta pay for dominating the open world on majority of servers.
---
Still working on hitting 60, so my gear is rather lacking at the moment.  It's easier to get used to a playstyle now and carry it forward than continue a poor habit that is only concealed due to easy content and good gear.  I have tons of pieces without any +healing and some that are dreadfully old from leveling.  My goal was to hit 60 first then start farming prebis in earnest.
---
Do warlocks scale badly? Just hit 20 on my new alt and really enjoying the game play. I am looking at spell damage gear and it all seems to add to total of damage dealt with my DOTs. Since I mainly DOT I am guessing that DD classes like mages get a lot more out of spell damage. Am I overthinking this or do warlocks not scale well?
---
&gt;Training rank 2 stamina would give my pet 5 stamina not 8(rank 1 + rank 2) correct?
---
Also note that the cost next to the Rank is to outright buy the whole Rank. If you have previous Ranks purchased, it is the difference between the two.
---
For example, Rank 10 Greater Stamina costs 185 TP. If you have Rank 9, it'll only cost you 35 points. It will always show (185) next to Rank 10 though despite having the lower ranks.
---
Probably not lol. Imagine going around slaughtering tens to hundreds of different insects and animals for specific body parts that they may or may not have, just for a few bowls of stew.
---
Yeah this should be hotfixed. I'm convinced. As soon as griefers get hit with this once or twice they're just gonna do it to everyone.
---
Classic is not a good solo experience...you could argue you are missing out on a huge chunk of any mmo without a group of friends.
---
Oh damn I thought you meant the eye of divinity. Little tunnel vision for me with that.
---
TIL there is a neutral AH
---
Why? They are just using the eyes to scout ahead in BRM. If someone kills them, that's their fault.
---
be sure to keep us posted about your endavours.
---
2H Arms stinks in PvE and takes up a debuff slot, don't play it
---
2H fury is very good for Horde, bad for the Alliance
---
I'm playing on Mankrik PVE, nice server with a pretty even ratio.
---
If you have your choice of timing in the opener is it feasible to make sure your first action lands as a tick ends and then pop your second action? Curious if that might eliminate their swing...
---
What was your name in Last Ascension?
---
And if you don’t plan on using a shield, redoubt is even more wasted.
---
It’s literally programmed into the game. It’s a mechanic. Unless you’re insinuating this is a bug, your claim doesn’t hold water. It would be 0% hard for Blizzard to have implemented these mobs as pets or literally anything other than civilians. Just because it hasn’t been widely supported over the past 15 years doesn’t make it “not a mechanic”. 
---
You don’t get to claim what an item/skill/etc. is intended for. It’s an open world MMO with hundreds of items in it. The point of items is for them to be used as the user sees fit. If it’s an oversight then Blizzard will change it. 
---
Breaking guard mechanics by using terrain is an example of *actual* abuse and mitigation of mechanics and next level grieving. 
---
Using spawnable civilians as a deterrent from AoE bombs is a fucking galaxy-brain use of *specifically implemented* mechanics, and makes for really interesting gameplay and teamfight dynamics. Sorry you can’t mindlessly blink and spam sapper charges anymore without potentially losing rank. You’re gonna have to adapt if blizzard doesn’t decide to change this. Try scouting the raid or baiting the yetis/eyes/etc or something. GL.
---
I'm the opposite. I love 2h arms build. Guides say to stick with it until you are raiding non-stop... I'm gong to stick with it and see how I stack up to the rest of the DPS. When I consistently suck only then will I cry to myself and change to fury. Right now I'm always top of 5-man dps charts
---
I mean I enjoy it but already kinda sick of it since I farmed it's ass over a decade ago and its the first ever made raid so it's not difficult at all so easy to farm again. 
---
I just really want to do BWL but still have to wait for it to come out again. Way more excited about farming BWL than MC but in the mean time MC/Ony only major things to raid so its my only choice for some raiding fun. 
---
I have a chill group I run with and we do it fast. It's fun but gets tiresome being the least geared rogue when I have made every MC run even more than some of the other rogues.
---
Another cheaper alternative is to snag an Expert Goldminer's Helmet from Uldaman. +7 Axes. Then grab Bone Slicing Hatchet or Serithil. Any fast axe really. 
---
But yea. Against 63 mobs you absolutely want 305 weapon skill for threat. Daggers and Muggers, Axes and Goldminers, Edgemasters, etc.
---
Entrenching boots, foremans head protector, and spiderfang carapace all drop in BRD alone.
---
WotF and stun resist have immense value to coordinated groups. Makes it insanely hard to peel dps off your heals
---
Lol....A raid sitting on a FP to corpse camp everyone is some how legitimate PvP but using an item in the game is an exploit. You can't be serious.
---
You guys realize hes horde saying he never gets attacked by horde...
---
[deleted]
---
&gt;Yeah horde always seems to have BRM, but alliance often has winterspring and LHC locked down in my experience.
---
Yeah and why the fuck they hold everything except of value is interesting.
---
ALiiance go to brd plz
---
This. Can’t stand gnomes, and night elves. Paladin is ridiculous easy pve.
---
Even more so for pvp
---
My PVE server is 70% alliance, so as horde I look forward to short wait times.
---
He is arms spec so he hits 4
---
So on every single private server I have played on, gold has inflated. Despite people quitting as the game goes on, gold has inflated.
---
Huge Venom Sacs were WAY more expensive during AQ progression than they are now.
---
Is it really sound to assume that gold will deflate in Classic?
---
I don't think so at all. Sure, less people play, but the amount of gold coming into the market seems it will always out weigh the gold leaving it.
---
Okay boomer.
---
I've heard 2h fury is a thing. I havent looked into it much. I havent even looked into fury much. i really love arms
---
I'm saying that a free Epic mount would completely invalidate the work other people put into getting theirs.
---
You over think it. Dots are for lvling and solo. End game u rarely dot, most of time u just caster shadow bolts
---
If I did my math right, Heal Rank 1 has a +healing coefficient of ~40.7% due to being trainable at level 16.
---
Heal Rank 2-4 have a +healing coefficient of ~85.7% due to not having that penalty.
---
Plenty of drops in 5mans  that can be considered for pre raid BIS or pvp BIS for pallys
---
It is not an exploit in the slightest.
---
or, option b, if they are in the hardcore life for mmos, they are more typical to jump and seek new experiences when they "done it all" in wow
---
but hey, could be both so I don't know. 
---
I know there is a bunch of SUPER hardcore mmo only people who never touch other kinds of games and only play mmos (and only wow like mmos) and i can see how they are just good at these kinds of games and would gravitate to those games. 
---
personally, I like variety, so I can't speak to that at all.
---
nice to see ya, i was playing with onslaught alliance side at the time
---
Thank goodness you didn't also get the bug where the gryphon randomly drops you
---
&lt;Cheesy Gordita Brunch" lmao that's amazing
---
Flying mounts made encounters way more rare and made exploring the world pointless and boring.
---
Dont do this. Trust me as an ally nothing more I would love to do than force dhks down hordes throat but this abuse of mechanic's will definitely end in week or even month long bans.
---
Dungeons and trash mobs arms will always win with sweeping strikes. For single target definitely fury
---
It's marked as a civilian but does not actually give a DHK, fyi.
---
I tried it nothing like true arms tbh, it’s really really hard to swap out of arms into fury. Part of why I said if I get a raiding two handed I definitely will go back lol, those big Crits are something else!
---
the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race
---
I've never gotten so bored reading a post.
---
It depends on the type of PVP.
---
What's a good addons to see people afflicted with a curse in a raid?
---
I want to see someone who rolls around in the open world with a GFPP on. What a glorious waste of money.
---
Ok I enjoyed this lol
---
If you say it often enough, it might come true
---
Yeah, its not bad.
---
But as a paladin you can wear plate armor in PvP (especally when AQ40 comes out), you can pop devotion aura, and you have bubble on top of that. Hand of freedom is great (altough people are chugging free action pots like its candy)
---
And if they go on the DPS in your group (usually warriors) you just bubble and keep healing.
---
Pallies are just way harder to kill than any horde healers, and if you are in organized you might do a combo like 2 warriors + 3 pala healers and just fuck everyone up.
---
Its not really until TBC that the factions imbalance goes to shit, alliance are perfectly viable in vanilla.
---
OXYRUSH i luv u
---
Bring whatever elixir you use, some greater fire protection potions for Ragnaros (bring 2 unless your guild is still doing progression, then bring 5+), and some food to eat before boss pulls.
---
Make sure you have a threat meter and deadly boss mods installed.
---
Read through an MC guide on boss mechanics, and know which ones are important for mages - these will be ones you need to decurse, or sheep mobs.
---
Make sure you are attuned for MC so you can take the short-cut entrance.
---
Make sure you are fully repaired before raid.
---
I don't know if you have 55 water yet (if not you're lucky and off the hook!) but if you do, get to raid 5 minutes early and make a boat load of water as you'll have to give everyone with a mana bar 3-4 stacks.
---
But most important, you are level 57 and your aggro range is going to be huge. Be very careful of where you stand, be extremely careful of packs you are skipping, and do not move up with tanks as they pull - stand way back!
---
PVE is still worth playing, i really enjoyed my rogue and lock with herbalism.  Collecting Nodes when you dont want to quest/the pain gets too much is quite relaxing.
---
In vanilla it was funny because nobody knew about it. Today it wouldn't be funny because people would be constantly doing that. But having it in for like a day would be pretty nice actually.
---
Since pve servers are so grossly dominated by alliance (some select servers actually being 99-1 alliance horde spread) and across all PvP servers the faction  balance is quite close there should be no long wait or very minor wait times for players, regardless of faction.
---
&gt; Like, you are probably worse of [sic] if you are doing anything, as you will just get aggro, pull extra shit or die.
---
Horde rogues don't respect aggro rules.
---
A saw a similar bug a really long time ago - I cast slow fall before getting on and it was like the griffon was overloaded and couldn't take off.  Most of the route was spent hugging the ground and flying through hills and terrain.
---
Dude this is so good
---
The next time a horde mage tries to kill me *inside* Gagetstan or Booty Bay, you bet i'm summoning this little guy.
---
on bigglesworth i have seen nothing but alliance jerks all good im 51 now so when i get 60 it will be payback time
---
Ok, perfect thank you. At level 20 is it overkill to level engineering to get spellpower goggles Xtreme for the plus 21 damage. My main is mining/engineering so I have lots of materials. Should I go for something with lots of stamina instead?
---
If you've suffered a recent head injury and are experiencing odd sensations such as out-of-place smells, flashes of light, or double vision, you should seek medical attention immediately.
---
Dude who gives a fuck? You are salty because you are constantly getting owned by the better faction... The horde.  
---
I go out of my way to kill every single Alliance I see in every zone no matter what level they are. It's a fucking PvP server so I can so as I please.  I'm hoping all the fucking casual Alliance players are quitting because of guys like me.  
---
You don't have faction pride, you would rather bitch on the forums about everything and in game, you all are fucking weak minded individuals because you are quitting and unsubbing because of phase 2.  That only makes your population in game ever works idiots.
---
"I have idea for change"
---
"Your idea for change is terrible, here's why."
---
"Hmm, I guess you're right, it was a bad idea. But your reading comprehension is poor and you're dumb because you pointed out how stupid my idea was. Also, why so worked up and angry?? Allow me to make misogynistic insults that reveal what kind of person I am at  the same time."
---
 stfu and stop wasting my time. panties in a wad? are you 12? also reddit's ignore feature works terribly, have you noticed this? try responding to see if it worked correctly this time.
---
Is the post not loading for anyone else?
---
Just saw shaman killed 2 yeti with his chain lightning. He said that he GAINED NO DHK! I have inspected him and his counter was indeed on zero.
---
Can someone else confirm that?
---
Could use a minor unless you get hit with 5+ sappers, but, I mean you are fighting a gold battle already anyway because they are utilizing sappers.
---
I'm absolutely loving all the people bitching about how this is "abuse" and needs to be patched out. People are so terrible at PVP the only way they can manage is to AoE people in groups of 10 at a FP. The mere thought of having to 1v1 people while paying attention to what they are doing terrifies them.
---
Its cross server, you will queue with all other horde players.
---
Ahhh, yes that guild name rings a bell
---
Before the reset, my honor points looked oddly high.  I almost feel like Blizz has something going on; perhaps a response to all the bitching about honor grinders.
---
Healing helm from Azuregos is BiS for all healers, and the dagger is BiS for resto shammies and druids.
---
I’m not sure how the rest of the gear fairs for other classes, but as a resto druid Az holds two of my BiS.
---
Curses will show up in the default raid frames.
---
Have you tried asking them about PVE?  I really do stand by it as a server choice, PVP should not be the way that it is, and lets be honest it won't change due to BG's the campers will still camp bodies etc.
---
I speced healing at 52 and healed all the way to 60 and I was still missing a few pieces. Lbrs and dm both hit 40k xphr. Brd was around 20k for me. Ubrs is like 3. 
---
I had 300 healing at 55 and got to Domo in a pug. Was   able to put up 40k raw doing that. Gear increased my raw 3-4x. I'd recommend focusing on that if you want to pull weight in mc.
---
This database value about database values have databases value my database value.

---
Man i get ganked all the time! I just dont whine like you
---
Warrior being the default raid tank is just the norm
---
Did you just take an intro SQL course?
---
Yep.  The ones playing classic are mostly on whitemane alliance.
---
Well it's a pvp server so I kept full hp anytime in the world even before p2 and that's not going to change in future phases.
---
Ranking is based against what everyone else also gained. You may have lost rank if everyone else increased their rank moreso than you did.
---
I think we are saying the same thing here and are in agreement that horde will have somewhere close to 50% longer wait times.
---
Anyone got links to threads where players who's binge-killing people talk about it? I only see these ones
---
good info
---
Warlocks arguably scale the best into late game as you spam shadowbolt in raids instead of DoTs.
---
Don't worry about leveling just get lots of stamina, intellect, and spirit.
---
Yep, I know where my next upgrades are going.  It's going to suck for a little bit because I just got the devout robes and the 4 piece (+23) set bonus.  It was worth replacing my dreamweave pieces because of the massive boost to stats.

I can't find a single comment to explain how this wont make things much MUCH worse. Each one of these cities is now going to be a nest of rogues who can vanish from guards. No different than before you say? Well, except for the fact that you can no longer fight back, because they will all have a yeti out and they can still vanish away from guards like always.
---
Congratulations, your 'solution' made things worse. Who would have thought that using a regressive exploit would be a bad thing!
---
You may be surprised by this, but being an elitist asshole is not a popular and exciting personality type. So yes... I do find you &amp; your apparent buddy interesting and try to picture how you got this way.
---
between 3-7g or much less with professions to get an HOUR of fire protection, especially if you are expecting enemies to sapper charge your group, is not a glorious waste of money
---
CoW is kinda useless, it's a flat reduction, and for raid has little impact on enemy DPS.  It's not even worth the GCD let alone the debuff slot.
---
Oh fuck guys we gotta clean this shit up before we get our cocks crunched
---
52-60 could all be spent farming your healing pre bis. 
---
BRD drops a lot of things you want. Second Wind, Gloves off princess, multiple weapon options, boots and 52 is a good level to start it. You can heal it shadow but it's a lot easier to heal holy.
---
Both, unless you have other options.
---
You are embarrassed...for me? Thank you. Good bye.
---
I was expecting a good read here but I have no idea what the point of the post was :/
---
What do you mean “affliction lock”? There’s a couple good specs out there for raiding, but they are all shadowbolt spam.
---
Ok, yes if you all hit the same exact RP you can all go to 14.  Usually you need to talk with others that are grinding honor and not go too far ahead but if you are all the same you could hit it.  If one of them gets a DK though, that is a week gone.
---
One is the best geared tank on the server and guild is logging top 3. They aren’t moving. 
---
I agree it’s a mess. I’m choosing to forgo the headache and I don’t want to grind 60 again yet haha.
---
Good example of what happens when you try to bring in your 40-man raid. They bring 3.
---
It's pretty nutty on Fairbanks. The horde seem to dominate the server in population and as a result BRM is almost always horde camped.  HOWEVER, all the other hotspots--E/WPL, DM, and WS seem to have an alliance raid at nearly any given time. On one hand I feel bad for the ally because BRM is so pivotal. But on the other, I can't run DM without dying on the way in, not can I farm the shit I need in WS without being corpse camped/ganked in Everlook lol.  This is of course barring the rare occasion some small group of horde decide to pushback.
---
I can't imagine being in a server where one faction constantly controls every hotspot.
---
Did you know that you don't need to go through the cave to turn in the quest? There is a jump you can make to get to her without going through the cave.
---
Mutanus the Devourer in WC is immune to shadow I remember. I seem to recall some ghosts/skeletons/zombies being immune to shadow but can't remember exactly which.
---
Should have just waited for them to pass, and then fucked with the plebs on their 60% mounts.
---
Most raids usually don't have the patience to wait for them, and then you could have annoyed the raid that way.
---
LOL I don’t even camp fps, but when I get camped I don’t turn into some sad individual who goes out of their way to give ppl pvping at hubs dhks lmfao
---
Yeah, if there’s one talent I am 100% taking next time I spec for pvp, it is natural shape shifter 3/3.
---
That is not true at all. Where are you getting this information?
---
Your expectations of what someone needs to start raiding are utterly ridiculous.  350 healing needed just to raid "viably"?  Up until this weekend when the Robes of the Exalted finally decided to drop for me, I was sitting at 355, and that's with 2/8 T1 and a +55 enchanted Benediction...  Needless to say, between those epics and a few other dungeon drops, I started raiding *well* below 350 +healing and was never even close to being a liability.  Sure, even now my gear still has a few spots I'd really like to upgrade, but I'm easily at/near the top of healing.  Pretending I have to be this geared to even be "viable" is a joke.
---
I can't remember a couple of pieces to be sure of the exact number, but I know I started raiding below +200 healing.  Assuming even somewhat competent player skill, there's nothing currently in the game that can't be healed in that gear.
---
Pretty sure this is what all feral druid players do whenever they see a hunter pet or another feral druid.
---
Right, useless until a pally Reck-bombs you in full Grand Marshal armor with The Unstoppable Force in hand
---
I was in a similar situation to yours and the consensus seems to be that the class discords have the best bis lists. Search for fight club discord and you can find their bis spreadsheet linked in the faq I believe
---
Solo dire maul East and accidentally pull a stealth Satyr? Curse of Doom then Rank 2 Banish, then get to max shadowbolt range and wait until banish has less than 2 seconds left, cast Shadowbolt and then immediately cast rank 1 banish after that, your rank one banish should go up with about 19 seconds until it breaks and Curse of Doom should have about 22-23 seconds until it breaks. Then get to max range and cast Shadowbolt at less than 2 seconds on banish, once it breaks cast corruption, then immolate, then curse of doom should go off, now cast curse of agony and death coil, and then cast Shadowbolt and the mob will likely die before it gets out of death coil and gets back to you. 
---
Also useful for killing 2nd boss in dire maul East, satyr boss, cast on him and then jump off ledge back to Hydrospawns pool, doom will go off about the time he gets done pathing down the tunnel to the pool
---
&gt;while the pet is fighting (probably pvp outside of Ony) it despawns the pet when the hunter is out of range. When that happens it stores all effects, dots etc on the pet for when it is resummoned.  
---
&gt;Happens a lot in pvp that the pet gets feared and thanks to dash it runs into the distance and despawns. When immediately resummoned, it will also immediately run away in fear again.  
---
&gt;In this case, the fear was still stored and pets tend to have the greatest pleasure in
---
In theory then, could a pet get the bomb from baron in MC and then could you release the pet for some massive AOE?
---
A few phases from now and you'll have feralheart too :D
---
Just uninstall the addon and they can't see your progress. Get someone else to check the ladder.
---
So you think Blizzard intentionally added a way to allow players to control Civilians and use them against the enemy? You don't think it's even _possible_ that it being a civilian is an oversight?
---
You probably think using layering to respawn raid bosses was intended too.
---
yeah its probably overkill, but does it sound like fun? if so then yeah, get that warlock some dope ass goggles.
---
it truly is mindboggling youd used 20 binds on a mouse over using modifers lmao. macros, different rank of dots for pvp purposes. different ranks of banish, and the rest of the spells easily equate to 45 and i have no problem with my keybinds very fast and easy to use.
---
Honestly I started to write a response, but you are so wrong on so many points, and you seem deadset on your opinion so I will just respectfully disagree. With everything you wrote lol.
---
You didn't die because they outnumbered you, you died because you click your buttons. Remember that
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7434/frostsaber-pride-watcher this one ?
---
Damn, you’re the first person to think of this! Absolutely brilliant idea dude. I’m sure none of the horde camping the FP will check the RR path for alliance
---
TL;DR : BIS is not always BIS. And I made a blog about it.
---
So how detrimental is a dishonorable kill?
---
The draw distance in BG was different
---
But is he/she still buttfloss666?
---
The riding skill was very cheap  in classic and the mount was the expensive part (which was changed later) - that means the dreadsteed and the frostwolf howler are totally separate - but they both don't need riding skill whatsoever ((75 and 150 was introduced later). So you don't need exalted Orgrimmar to ride the frostwolf mount (but you would for the other wolves)
---
&gt;Trust me as an ally nothing more I would love to do than force dhks down hordes throat but this abuse of mechanic's will definitely end in week or even month long bans.
---
Considering I haven't been able to play for weeks anyways the ban would me 100% worth it.
---
The Details! add-on has another addon called Tiny-threat meter which our guild uses. I'd double check with your guild what meter they use as it's always best to all be on the same one.
---
Aw look at you squirm. Sorry dude, you said it yourself. Can't take it back now. GG, though lol.
---
From his fear of getting a dk from grieving probably. Enlightenedcentrism at its best.
---
Winning is a strong word here
---
Yeah no. Rouge is half health you renew him. Gets hit by some stuff few second later again and dies. If someone 'snipes' your renew then they are full health again and survive.
---
Im not butthurt or qq. My rogue has viskag and brutally blade. I was asking a question too but all I get in response is butthurt op.
---
probably still wearing truestrikes because hit cap is pretty important. the BDS set bonuses are nice and all, particularly the 3pc crit, but the slots it requires to get there are pretty essential for hit. if you're using pre-raid bis items there (Bloodmail Boots, Truestrikes, and Devilsaur 2pc), that's 4% hit you lose. The only way you're going to make that up to get 9% if you need it is with pieces like OTP, Accuria, Puissant cape, etc. which is fairly rare to have one one character at the moment
---
The difficulty is that the person in charge of healing probably doesn't know what they're doing *either* - but they think they do.
---
Which creates a problem. Doing it right when everyone else is doing it wrong isn't helpful - it's usually better to heal badly as a team than heal exceptionally as individuals.
---
I can tell you that, as a Priest, your best options are normally cast-cancelling large heals and taking advantage of FSR as much as possible rather than heavy down-ranking. But if your healing lead is having you spot heal random raid members (which, frankly, is a dumb way to use your Priests), that's not going to help you much.
---
Likewise, training yourself to recognize efficient uses of Prayer of Healing isn't much use if you're grouped with 4 other Priests or your other raid healers are constantly spot healing your group to full unnecessarily.
---
I saw a recent post someone asking what do i do now im 60, i dont know my way in any dungeons, my gear is garbage no one wants me as dps either. What i wanna say is don’t be that guy. As a warrior you will be asked to tank no matter what spec you are unless you play with friends or guildies who can tank for you. You are not suppose to solo quests to lvl60 without doing any dungeons. You should tank brd, lbrs, scholo, strat ud, strat live, dm, all the way to 60. Don’t bother with questing from 53 and up. You need gears from dungeons, tank gears and dps gear. I suggest u respec to full prot, make tanking a lot easier especially if you don’t have any good gear yet, tank all dungeons collect all gears from 53 to 60, respec to full fury at 60. This way you will have most preraid bis gear for tanking and dps, so you will be totally fine tanking with full fury spec at 60 because u have good tanking gear and u can also join raid as fury dps becuase u have good dps gear too. Then go out finish quests that has good reward when you 60 full fury spec and have good gear.
---
*Windfury Totem wants to know your location*
---
I am not far behind the dw warriors. Its difficult tho, you have to keep an eye on your white swing timer. At cleaving battles 2h is number one, but people mostly care about bosses.
---
If you want to make the 1h queue a little less clogged, 2h is decent enough.
---
My grandmother said something similar as she binged a ncis marathon. Some folks disconnect how they choose to spend their free time from how others do. Don't let them project their bullshit onto you.
---
Ah a battle of pure skill, they have bested you this time, but surely you will try hard and finally learn how to play the game, and you shall defeat them next time! What a great and not stupid game.
---
I didn't say I had in idea for a change. I said I wondered what it would be like. Are you aware of the difference?
---
I see the feed from Blasted Lands has been shipped elsewhere.
---
Camping the boats that go between continents 24/7 (which the horde do on Fairbanks) definitely is griefing. It's not particularly terrible griefing, but it's griefing.
---
Experienced it once on firemaw, felt wrong
---
This is horde cope.
---
how do you fix this?
---
petopia is a great resource for a new hunter, especially when trying to rank pet skills.
---
also, +100 healing to Flash of Light and +300 healing to Greater heals with Blessing of Light!
---
? Squirm?
---
I’m confused. Didn’t you just agree to me?
---
lol I'm just saying man this sub is filled with post about complaints. I wasn't even attacking you but legit asking. But you do you man, have a great life with how you speak to others.
---
Probably. From my understanding, there’s an “optimal level-XP” range and if you’re too low you get a reduced amount of xp. I could be wrong but this is just what I’ve observed. Add to that, a high level player soaking up XP as well, and you’re not left with a whole lot. 
---
Take it with a grain of salt, though. The rate at which they’re able to clear the dungeon may make up for the reduced XP you get per kill.
---
dude its just a joke to get the alliance redditors mad don't take things so seriously lol
---
I'm 6/8 with the rogue set.  :D
---
I think a big factor is a lot of people have started raiding or already got bis. Why ever go into ubrs again after you get all your pieces? God knows I'll do my best to never go into brd again.
---
Arguable, if you can juggle him well and never take a debuff from his caster form, DS is a great spec for soloing him. I have died 1 time to him in the past 3 weeks because I was talking on discord and messed up three rock jumps in a row due to being dazed by imps. Siphon is more useful for the imp phase, DS lets you nuke him faster while tapping and getting back health from voidwalker sac
---
-100 RP (which you get for the first DHK of the day) should never be hundreds of hours of work, it's 2% of your current rank so even at rank 13 it's not a crazy high amount to get 1 even if it does suck. And once you get a DHK you see in chat what civilian you killed and figure out it was a yeti and grind your honor elsewhere.
---
I get the black stain but eh plenty of people got DHKs on week 1 because it didn't matter and you can just pretend that's where you got it.
---
I remember back in cataclysm a friend would spam me with throwing axes while i flew in a circle in the gurubashi arena. The axes never reached me and after a while i was kiting a whole garrison's worth of axes behind me. Those were the days man
---
I'm on a balanced server, the ganking is both ways.
---
I don't know what to believe, but based on my kills last week vs my kills this week, which i believe I had less this week, my honor points are higher. But I'm still at work and haven't logged on since maintenance.
---
"Be sure to give me a 5-star rating!"
---
Thanks !
---
Don’t forget judgment of wisdom and light.
---
I mean if you want to be naive about this, go ahead, we will laugh when you get suspended lol
---
Jokes on them, I don't attack it if i've been frost novad by four mages.
---
I like getting downvoted for stating a fact and asserting a speculation without an opinion attached to it.
---
TCS with int is all you need, honestly.
---
Yeah if i didn't click evasion and sprint i'd have taken down at least 48 of those horde
---
The problem is that you need everyone to keep their lists up to date. And you'll still have people suddenly changing their priorities when something drops.
---
At the end of the day, free rolls with some loot council on big items works better than any other system.
---
Finally, the Alliance have a way to fight back and make the Horde quit!
---
I noticed this a few weeks back with target dummies. I just assumed that it was an interface bug and that they wouldn't actually count as civilians. Of course, I'm not mad enough to test it as I'm ranking.
---
If anyone could post proof that this is the case rather than a whole thread prematurely celebrating over a potential glitch that might protect you from getting ganked, that would be great.
---
Yeah fair enough. But benediction has 160 heal power which is a lot compared to what you got before (50 maybe honestly unsure right now)
---
Alliance is the better faction for PVE almost entirely due to paladins. The expertise that humans get definitely helps, but the simple fact that you can place every paladin buff on every player in the raid (as opposed to Horde who only get to have shamans in the WF groups) really makes Alliance shine.
---
I expect most of the top speedrun times to be achieved by Alliance guilds.
---
The one caveat of all this though - if you are a hardcore PVE guild aiming to achieve the best times in speedruns, your guild basically needs to gimp themselves in PVP by rolling human wherever possible, a race that is very underwhelming in terms of PVP viability.
---
Yea man people who abuse unintended mechanics against other players have never been banned before lol
---
Just go do it, and then when you're banned come here and post and well all laugh at you.
---
How old are you?
---
"Oh no, someone pointed out our hypocrisy... quick, call him names!"
---
Azshara has been mentioned, but I want to give you a word of caution: Avoid the 3 Satyr camps on the norther peninsulas. Those are popularly farmed for demonic runes/felcloth. If a warlock sees you there, they'll likely kill you to avoid competing for tags on these mobs. Just a fair warning.
---
Silithus is great, almost always empty - head there after 55. 
---
Winterspring can be hit or miss. The frost yetis are what helped me level 58-60. I killed hundreds of them. There are a few quests tied to them, as well. If you can get a group for the Winterspring Elite quests (3 of them, I think) those are good XP too. 
---
WPL + EPL are hell.
---
Lol you can’t just call it a pve item because you don’t like the effect. If it was a “pve item” it wouldn’t give dk.
---
That’s outrage and not any sort of logic talking there. That or a very poor understanding of people.
---
Pve server are minor compared to pvp servers, where the split is much more im favor of horde. Official numbers dont exist.
---
Arrogant prick, speak for yourself. I can tell exactly what's going on.
---
It’s definitely doable it just takes practice, you jump back and forth between the rock and the ledge almost instantly, as soon as you land on rock, you jump back etc, keeping the boss at max range where he paths all the way back to climb onto the ledge. Once he’s in tree or wolf form, you can allow him to run closer to you. You won’t be able to dog him or cast  on him when he’s on Satyr form, you just have to be patient until he swaps back to another form.
---
So basically you can just equip a shitload of healing gear, equip the sword, then switch back to your normal gear and still have it heal you for like 400 every 3 seconds.
---
That's absurdly broken. The only thing stopping this from being the meta for all warriors/paladins/hunters is the super low drop rate.
---
There's tons of stuff that could be improved. Damn near everything in the game has existed in a better version since. It's not as simple as retail vs classic, they're two different games sure, but so many of the bad things about classic have nothing to do with those differences and wouldn't ruin the experience for anyone. Many of those things had to be RECREATED by blizzard when developing classic. Think about that, Blizzard made flight masters unable to automatically dismount players on purpose. That's some really stupid shit and it comes from this 'classic is better' mentality that proves more than ever that people know WHAT they like but not WHY they like it.
---
Look at all the people whining that "PvP on a PvP server is ruined" now that they're on the other side of getting screwed.
---
I can't imagine a world in which I have a strong enough opinion on other redditors to voice it in a gaming subreddit.
---
Eye of Arachnida is clearly a PvP item. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to use it in the world.
---
123 on the hog combo with enchant. Bene also has much better stats on it.
---
ITS LITERALLY A PVE QUEST YOU MUPPET
---
Holy fuck the cognitive dissonance is so goddamn thick with some of you people
---
He’s horde, no suprise he doesn’t see it as a problem.
---
I'm not hit capped - only have around 5%. How much is this likely to affect my performance in raids? Should I be prioritising that last 5% hit over everything else?
---
Paid transfers allow pvp to pve. When it'll happen? Can't say anytime soon unless people put pressure on blizzard
---
Our MT has a 60% mount..... we have a konga line of people /following him typically.
---
He died of cancer. He'd been battling it for a while.
---
what do you think horde will be doing if they are facing long queues? lol
---
Yeah but this is incredibly easy to avoid if you just stop farming lowbies in a neutral city. If training dummies can can have a similar effect anywhere as some people are speculating, then that should be fixed. But the yeti can literally only be used a small number of designated spots.
---
Like your definition isn't self-constructed either.
---
Since all ToS and EULA documents are intentionally vague, to allow coverage over future infractions not even imagined yet, there will never be such a specific rule. So for that specific note I don't think you're being intellectually honest with your question, since I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you have a general sense of ToS vagueness.
---
That being said, here's from `GlobalStrings.lua`- part of the World of Warcraft UI code, in a sense. The following below bits will be relevant and something I hope you pass along.
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT = "Physical Harassment";
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT_DESCRIPTION = "If the sole purpose or intent of any action is to continually upset, aggravate, or otherwise annoy another player, that action may be considered physical harassment or \"grief play\".  Before reporting physical harassment, make sure that the situation that is being petitioned falls outside the realm of the PvP policy (www.worldofwarcraft.com/policy/pvp.shtml). ";
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT_TEXT1 = "The following are NOT considered physical harassment:";
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT_TEXT2 = "Attacking a creep or NPC that another player has already engaged";
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT_TEXT3 = "Continually attacking and/or killing an NPC";
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT_TEXT4 = "\"Spawn camping\" (\"claiming\" a spawn point in order to repeatedly attack a creep)";
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT_TEXT5 = "\"Corpse camping\" (waiting by a player's corpse to attack them as they resurrect)";
---
    PHYSICAL_HARASSMENT_TEXT6 = "\"Training\" (leading enemies to another player to force combat)";
---
Nothing loads for me.
---
I 100% expect it will be cleared within 1-1.5 hrs of zoning in. Lag, queues, and attunement complications are the only possible obstacles.
---
I'm not doing it at all, I am having it done to me. And it didn't work. I'd know because I would have raged, I'm ranking.
---
Zero in about 8 weeks of raid.  :(  Two sorcerous daggers.  One SoD. 
---
Also zero ToEP, RoSP, RoVP, MIC...  Only one choker of FL, two choker of Enl. Absolute trash rng.  
---
On the plus both tier 1/2 has dropped like candy for the warlocks.
---
I'm sorry but you made this choice. It's common knowledge how this was going to play out and has been for nearly two decades. if you roll on a pvp server, expect pvp to be forced upon you and often at times when it's both inconvenient and frustrating. 
---
You made this choice. take responsibility for this choice. the game will not change for you nor should it have to.
---
I tried this yesterday and it reset my respawn timer so I had to wait 2 minutes again, defeating the purpose :-(. Perhaps this only works when you haven't been killed 10 times
---
Except Mages can't equip 2H swords...
---
Clearcast. Gnome mage
---
Remove daily question threads and discussions threads. Have pinned meme/fluff/gripe threads.
---
Another user recommended it,and I'm saying it again because it's the best possible option. Quarantining the actual relevant content into daily questions and daily discussion threads makes it so that 90% of the people coming here don't actually engage in those conversations. It also makes it even harder to find that information for people googling. You'll suddenly see the Reddit have relevant content instead of the endless BS. 
---
Having the memes/fluff/griping all confined to stickies would fix the issues with toxicity because all that nonsense would be hidden away from the average user, we'd be essentially swapping out the focus of the sub from its current focus on irrelevant fluff, to actual relevant discussion
---
Tres bien
---
Gtfo. I didnt predict 70 30 faction imbalance.
---
WoW is one of these games that has so much to do and so many different things that appeal to different players.  While this is one of the things that makes the game great, it is also one of the things that makes it difficult to say what direction would be best to take classic.  For me, I'm all about the idea of keeping 60 as the max level.  However, one thing that I really enjoyed back in the day was arena.  I would love to see arena for level 60s.  I'm a casual player, seeing how I have a fiance and a job and friends etc.  But I play all the fucking time and I'm still considered and will always be considered a casual.  The idea of TBC coming out in the not too distant future does not make me happy.  The speed at which raids have been added does not make me happy.  I play like 5-6 hours usually a day during the week and like 8-12 on the weekends (when I can).  I can't keep up with this shit. There's too much to do.  Why rush everything? Cant we just enjoy the classic experience without pushing for a carbon copy of retail?
---
Because it's an exploit of game mechanics and saronitte bombs and eula and im just going to keep sitting here spouting buzzwords without actual proof of this specific topic being a bannable offense, until you get tired of replying and I take your non-answer for an admission of defeat.
---
The least we have done trash clear with was 15.
---
I remember when I played Vanilla back in the day and my video card started to die. I end up writing in trade chat, "Hey would anyone know why there are a bunch of weird squares in IF?"
---
got like 10 whispers that my video card was dying.
---
I jump off the boats and swim so my corpse doesn't sail back to the other continent forcing me to rez on a death ship going the wrong direction.
---
Yes, but in my experience you'll be asked to heal often as healers and tanks are scarce a lot of the time! But again you can heal 5 man content fine as shadow.
---
Looks like u/dirtbagmamo mom’s vagina
---
That's 1% off of being hit capped, which should be your priority when considering gear. 
---
If you're not a human or an orc for their racials, then you'll need either 9% or edgemaster's. I'd recommend edgemaster's personally, for the increased weaponskill. If you go ahead and buy them now you won't have to replace your gloves for the rest of Classic.
---
Depends on your gear, but I'd want at least 20. The single pulls aren't terrible, but the double giant pulls get kinda rough when your dps is low since they hit pretty hard and can run your healers oom if you're all rocking mostly non raid gear.
---
I made a post complaining about it, got downvoted into oblivion. Seems like the population that browses "new" on here doesn't give much of a shit haha
---
My friends and guildies don’t camp Gadgetzan like a bunch of fucking losers lol go cry about it. It’ll only hurt players who are dumb enough to hurt themselves
---
Serves them right.
---
Ham is good.
---
Song name?
---
Same here, but when I say that people got no DKs, I get flamed in this topic.
---
zg fish trinket my dude
---
Broken Tooth
---
Oh, yeah, sorry, should have specified I was only talking about the dummies being fixed. 
---
Fighting in a neutral city? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Honor is basically split among tags and groups, and lowered more by DRs. So if you're in a 40-man raid killing the same few players over and over you can get down to 5–10 honor/kill on average, whereas if you're soloing most enemies once or twice you're likely to be more like 150+ honor/HK on average.
---
Fuck man, did you ever consider that she kidnapped herself, man, sir
---
You mean the ones buried deep in the silithid hives full of 62-63 elites that nobody is going anywhere near while leveling?
---
How would you solo DM Tribute?
---
On my way to BRM with a group of 5 to run LBRS. Takes 45 mins for me to get there through getting murdered 6 or 7 times. (I’m a rogue) 
---
Over an hour goes bye and 2 members still haven’t made it. 1 of them says they can’t take it anymore and leaves group. Group sequentially falls apart. I am frustrated. 
---
I decided to take my frustration out by flying over to STV and go on a Serial murder of lvl 40-45’s. 
---
I know it was an asshole thing to do but damn did it feel good being on the other side
---
I'm not at all, thats why I brought it up. I also don't believe handing out player driven DHKs is an answer to anything.
---
Sorry not trying to bust the mood here. Love WoW and will be back when I have time to invest in it again.  Classic is the best thing since wonderbread.
---
Civilian status is not anti-PvP. It's to punish people for killing something they aren't supposed to kill. Players are not supposed to kill the Eye. It's not that hard. Don't kill the Eye. 
---
If you don't like DHKs roll a PvE server. It's simple, really.
---
It's infinitely better than the current arrangement. It'd be content that's actually relevant to the average user instead of "gamer culture" BS.
---
Yeah it's much better than the silithus ellies even, I think it's like 6-7% compared to 2% or so in silithus.
---
Yeah, some guilds are good at sticking together. But a lot aren't.
---
As a horde you usally run from Kargath together, and then gather up at some point in SG before BRM.
---
But on the path to the first stop, thats when you have the chance to get a pickoff.
---
Just go for the guy who is furthest behind, and hope he isn't an active voice chat user (who quickly calls for aid). Then just quickly dispose of him, and force the entire raid to turn around, or if they send resserts just sap or CC them.
---
Anything to waste their time, and keep them exposed out in the open.
---
Aight lad, you also seem deadset on getting ridiculed so here you are:
---
\- You stated that gnome warriors are pretty rare because it makes it harder for PVE. Hate to break it to you, PVE is braindead easy in this game. If you want to min max PVP, you can do so and still manage to clear content faster than 99% of all guilds (see: APES, GRIZZLY, etc - all-gnome/dwarf guild). To imply that all of these poor players are FORCED to roll human, and THAT's why Alliance have it harder just makes you look like a dumbass. Love how you concluded your long tirade with that little comment, almost to cap off showing to everyone how absolutely clueless you are.
---
\- You stated that \[the player\] is getting hit by fears and stuns all the time. Use a tense WSG premade versus premade as an example. The optimal setup for a 10-man is \[2 warr, 2 mage, 2 priest, 1 pally/sham, 1 hunt/lock, 1 rogue, 1 druid FC\]. If you disagree or don't understand why, and are about to suggest using a bunch of rogues in BGs, go ahead and continue to prove how absolutely clueless you are. In such a setup, assuming both teams are of equal skill, there are very few instances where key players are at risk of getting feared or stunned. Yes, it happens, but not to the degree that you are implying. Furthermore, as I already stated, the opposing faction can further mitigate this by using their respective cooldowns (i.e.: Stun --&gt; HOJ, Fear --&gt; Psychic Scream) on players that DONT have a racial to counter it. Go search on YouTube "WSG meta 2019" maybe you will learn something.
---
\- You stated that WF and chain heal are OP, as if you plan on running all warriors and rogues (and, judging by how utterly clueless you seem, a bunch of enhance shamans too!) in your group. In reality, only 1-2 people will be benefiting from this totem at any given time. Contrast this with the passive buffs provided by paladins as well as on-the-spot buffs such as Freedom, BOP, and Bubble. If you cannot determine which is better, my heart goes out to you.
---
Wait why are they so mad about it? I'm new.
---
As a paladin I absolve you from your sins
---
I've managed to get together +300 Healing in gear and will proceed to test.
---
Hi, /u/The_Hunk

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e5mvvs/wintrading_on_razorgore_pvp_eu/).
---
I'm tauren, and am faaar too poor for edgemasters ATM. 
---
In terms of being 4% away from hitcap - would you expect my DPS to really suffer in raids? I'd rather delay my first raid for a week while I grind 9% hit if I'm gonna turn up and be a bit shit :)
---
When you swap back out of your +healing gear into your PvP set, you will have about 50% of your HP missing
---
You can tell who plays horde and alliance just from the comments. This is hilarious.  I hope you post some screenshots after :)
---
Rogues being rogues tbh.
---
May I ask, why are you at 9% hit? After 6% (yellowcap with 305wepskill) crit becomes way more valuable.
---
Not trying to ridicule, just wondering
---
I don't reckon BGs will change anything, for they will require some kind of skill and without constraints the main problem of MMOs will always be people who find their enjoyment in ruining others.
---
So you'll have people camping flight path landings. You'll have people throwing a few DOTs on you as you try to deal with a bunch of mobs. You'll have people who splatter people with much lower gear.
---
My best advice is Don't \*clap\* Roll \*clap\* On \*clap\* A \*clap\* PvP \*clap\* realm.
---
First sin is saying here instead of hear
---
Theyve already stated there was a display bug
---
Aw did I upset you?
---
&gt; My guess is most people buttmad about multiboxers like you are just too poor to afford the extra subs
---
If you pay for those subs youre a dummy. Like try to keep up. That's how this whole convo started. No one is spending cash on extra wow subs. Its all self sustaining. Just shows how little you know about this stuff.
---
And it's infinitely quicker to just run through the cave than trying to herd ~~cats~~ people to the right spot to do this.
---
My guild uses a dkp system where MS is half your dkp and whoever has the highest amount that bids gets it so if your roster is set it ends up working out in a round Robin way. OS is 25% and can only bid if no one wants for MS.
---
If you corpse camp in a group of 10 while making the game unplayable for the opposing faction, you are a piece of shit.
---
I've rolled many pvp realms and the issue was never this bad.
---
This post is about the yetis, which could not be used in your scenario. Has anyone confirmed target dummies will give a DK? I agree that would exploitable and should be fixed, but that’s not even what the post is about.
---
Oh my lordy, you're not very smart are you? Saronite bombs rebuilt the damn the floor... This is literally just to scout... Blizzard made them worth DHKs, if that's not intended, then they would remove it.
---
So you're saying that players should not PvP against something that is "clearly a PvP item"?
---
Why isn't Eye of Killrog a Civilian? They are functionally identical.
---
Are drop rates in Classic known? Have they been data mined? Or we estimating based on the ratio times an item drops to the number of times the mob is looted?
---
Pretty sure he's horde
---
OP IS LYINGGGGGG, they may say its a civilian but it doesnt give DHK
---
Hey are you from 2009?
---
You should check the AH for the chromosome you're missing.
---
Yeah I give zero shits about ranking so I’m fine with whatever. 
---
Just like horde give zero shits about my wasted time and act accordingly. 
---
Circle of life.
---
More like 41,900 % hahaha.  Math is HARD.
---
I'm happy to tank and I tank all the time. I don't think you need to be full prot to tank while leveling.
---
suppose to have an exam
---
haha, you sound like a little baby that should probably stay out of these threads.
---
That's infinitely better than the current arrangement, and questions will actually get answered by people who are knowledgeable 
---
With current arrangement people only browse the daily question threads or the class discussion threads if they're NOT knowledgeable. People who know their stuff barely browse those because there is no need to. If it's posted outside the pinned threads, it has a better chance of getting a good answer, and it's much easier for a person trying to Google it before they ask a question to find it - I've googled a ton a wow related questions, and not once has it taken me to a daily question thread, but I've gotten reddit posts asking the specific question before, but only old ones.
---
It’s dangerous to bubble hearth with your health that low. Thanks to either spell batching or server lag you can easily be attacked after the hearthstone casts and die before it ports you to your hearth location. 
---
This is how my spirit went to Ironforge with my corpse in Kalimdor.
---
Yeah but those complaints are pretty much all about being outnumbered. You’re confusing the discussion. Horde racials are what people are claiming to be the cause of the imbalance not the current complaints.
---
UNLIMITED BANNED. /S 
---
(nice concern trolling btw)
---
For real though: It's probably just a warning lol
---
What server are you on
---
Definitely recommend this. Even shows the debuffs and buffs! :D
---
I was Cramer, noob elf rogue :D I was in last Ascension with Shylar and Vexed for a bit and played with them on horde too
---
No, it's still also the hordes fault. They're the ones who are camping exactly 20 yards in front of your corpse. It doesn't matter if the game awards you fake internet points for it, any decent human would have seen what this behavior is causing for the receiving faction, shown a speck of empathy, and gone off to do anything else in the game.
---
Works on all client but US.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
I'd like to get off now please
---
What I consider an exploit is "unintended gameplay mechanics that negatively and directly impact other players"  
---
Meanwhile what the real definition of an exploit is *whatever Blizzard decides is an exploit*
---
Yeah, I get that, but I've haven't really done any raid killing. I'm 59, so still questing.  But the honor I got yesterday alone was like 3 times what I assumed I would get for yesterday.
---
I don't know. I've been living that life and I feel like if you enjoy the WoW raid environment enough to go hardcore, it's actually pretty hard to supplant that to a gamer even if it does rip off it's entire gameplay style from WoW (like RIFT or FFXIV).
---
Yep and I like what he's doing
---
Oh this is nice, thanks!

Would be hilarious if blizzard flipped a switch on a random day.

Lol, you are fucking deluded man.
---
I'll take Orc or UD racials over any Alliance racials, any day of the week. There is literally nothing to compare. 
---
And yes, Paladins are nice, but they get better when horde get them in BC with an AoE silence to boot. But Shaman are fairly nice as well, so it is pretty disingenuous to completely disregard them.
---
You are basically saying... Alliance isn't THAT bad guys... and with that I can agree, there is still a chance to win as Alliance since most fights come down to gear anyhow. But Alliance does not have it better than Horde, there is no about BS you can spit out that changes that.
---
Why the taking off of the clothes?  You don't take any significant damage to gear in PVP.
---
Adding “cognitive dissonance” to my “things salty pvpers say” bingo.
---
U dont, but like i said, if you dont quest at all, just tanking in dungeons to lvl, why not go prot then? Make tanking easier especially when you just stated doing it, all ur gears are green and have no defense stats?
---
Grats
---
I found duel wield blood fury was more effective than 2H. Plus all end game BiS points at two one handers. Not sure where your belief of 2H weapons doing more than two 1H weapons compounding (even with damage loss to offhand) comes from. I don’t believe it to be true, what the crits are larger it does not equate to higher DPS
---
They're not going to ban people for simply using an item, which is all this boils down to.
---
I remember most people wanted to go on a huge city raid to take down other faction leader bosses.  Because now we would get epic gear from epic raid battles on other player cities.  Turns out, it was a fiasco, because not only did you get almost no honor shared between the one raid that got a tag on the faction boss (maybe 50 honor each person) but you would lose a lot of your contribution points by killing civilians that would spawn waves of guards while in the faction leader room.  There were always some quest givers there that would stop you from progressing.
---
Yeah I have it set up to prompt me when I enter a new instance.
---
But it's the information is not getting reset when I answer no on the prompt though, it just disappears.
---
If I reset it all the previous MC boss fights go away, but If I do nothing they are still there but I can't see them in overall

The secrets of the cosmos being squandered.
---
Estimates had them around 10000 vs 7000 last I checked. It's a sizable difference, but enough to atleast make a dent in one of the two biggest problematic horde servers.
---
Is there a trick for the dm:e jump runs as a priest? I kill the first pack but I always pull aggro on the jump.
---
Horde are safespotting in every town with guards and aren't getting punished...
---
Really makes you tempted to use your same name across servers. If you didn't, you might just be walking by an old friend (or uh enemy...).
---
Thorium Point is better because the graveyard is near :p. Just listen music and walk your corpse.
---
I know it works, I’m more curious about the social obstacles
---
I played on pve back in the day, heard exactly the same as what you've said and so decided to go in for the pvp realm. Just remade my character on a pve realm, at level 38. I simply dont get enough time to play that i can afford to spend most of it being corpse camped while trying to hand in quests or vendor shit. 
---
It was real fun during the first few weeks, but now i'll get my pvp fix from bgs and go back to enjoying the game in a more chill way with the time i actually get!
---
Maybe your mage needs to hit the gym ;)
---
Thanks, though, I wasnt paying attention to that.
---
I think they wont bundle pvp and pve serveurs together. I could be wrong tho
---
Hardly
---
The summonable Eye from that consumable in Strat UD counts as a civilian as well.
---
Think you need yeti horns too, which takes forever
---
Boo hoo
---
A few weeks ago my friends and I were standing in a random place in STV watching my druid friend in cat form make sweet love to my pet cat while I ranked her pet training up, making her "climax" every few seconds. We all stood around in a circle watching this happen. An alliance player popped up over a hill, watched us for a moment, then ran away. I still wonder what he was thinking.
---
Assuming I give a fuck about being banned after this complete mess on alliance side since p2 release.
---
then after bg every time you must travel back to get que. smart.
---
I understood that reference
---
Doubtful it'll happen. It'll be easier to just re-release TBC, then Wrath, then Cata, then MoP, then WoD, then Legion, then BFA. From there, just stay 'one expansion' behind Retail.
---
...maybe if there's demand open up "Legacy Servers" that are locked to each expansion; that reset every year. Then offer a discounted 'server transfer' that only allows you to migrate, up one expansion, to another server. - This way, most will opt to server transfer rather than lose all progress and restart as 'lvl 1s'.
---
...finally, the servers running 'last expansion before Retail' are offered a full-price server transfer to Retail. That way everyone will eventually come back to Retail or face non-stop "redos" of their favorite expansion.
---
And, all along, Blizzard makes bank.
---
Man, Druid gear looks so cool!!!!!
---
Just me gear honestly added up to more than 6%
---
That 180° turn at 0:40 is hilarious, holy fuck. Thanks for posting
---
Current Level: 56 
---
Started at lvl 11 in RFC, Currently doing LBRS/BRD.   
---
I have done \~2 quests total. (aside from Dungeon quests)  
---
I leveled completely as Prot... yes Protection.  My entire goal was to make it easy on whatever shit build the healer had, but what I found was most of the healers were actually resto/holy specced, so it was completely unnecessary for me to do that. With that being said, I am a very good tank and can make the healers job a little boring, I keep aggro tight, most people really want to have multiple runs when I am in a group. It also allowed me to reach a little above my level.   
---
Do I recommend leveling Prot? Please god no. 
---
Do I value my time spent learning to tank as Prot? Very much so, but it seems every warrior/shaman that I group with has to tell me why their build is a better tank build, which sucks dick. I went Protection to make sure heals would be okay, not to META some shit from Icyveins.   
---
Is it quicker than questing? Yes. Most people who level a warrior will not let you in on the secret of warriors. They fucking suck to level. Take your time and enjoy whatever it is you wish to do. Cleave groups can be one of the fastest ways to level, but it all is relative. There are current quest addons that will show you how to level to 60 in 4 days playtime. (Zygor) It will also completely bypass professions/skills/traveltime/adhdplayers/gankers/dungeons/havingfun, but if you want to get from 0 to 60 fast af, run quests through Zygor. 
---
If you have any questions regarding why Warriors suck, enjoy beating the brakes off most players(ceptrogues) in PVP.
---
If I get crit gear I’ll replace
---
Its a bug that you can use to significantly screw over other people, Seems like an exploit to me.
---
he post on asmongolds sub on the daily, he's not worth it
---
gunna try this against horde on arugal
---
Pagle welcomes all! :D
---
&gt; Noone had a clue on the system.
---
People that first entered a contested zone wondered, "What do I get for winning a fight against another player?"  That was answered in this patch, you get blues, purples, and mounts if you are dedicated enough to keep subscribing and keep slaying people in the open world, farming mats, outside dungeons, the gurubashi arena, and at world bosses.
---
Honestly I think most people on alliance side Heartseeker are just waiting for BGs at this point. No lifing for a week to get the same amount of honor I can get in two days of winning BGs makes zero sense to me.
---
Belcher.
---
Those are the one cat I absolutely HATE, simply because of that stupid yawn/growl they let out constantly. The only thing that’s close to that annoying is having a flying pet constantly flapping in your ears.
---
My favorite cats are Humar and Echeyakee, though Alliance can’t get a white lion until the Winterspring quest unless you have a horde friend summon Echeyakee for you. Or level a horde alt to level 17 on a PvE server
---
Thats really not true about prices being higher on  classic.
---
Some things are more expensive and others are much cheaper. There are a number of explanations you can think up for various item price differences. 
---
I still dont think youve made a case for why we should expect overall deflation going forward.
---
im 60 and rank 7, no dhk
---
odds are everyone will have a very very similar list.... mage with mageblade / choker at the top for example... and the system will just turn into a /roll system.
---
In this reply, you've literally addressed none of my points and keep alluding to TBC-and-onward, as if that has any relevance in a discussion about racials IN VANILLA. Lastly, obviously with any large team game (i.e.: 10 or more players per team) factors such as individual skill, cohesion, and gear levels will have an equal if not greater effect on a particular team's success. But the question was "Which faction has better PVP racials?" and I gave my supported answer. You seem to think I'm referring to shit like 1v1s or ganking, which I am not.
---
Eye of Arachnida can be summoned in battlegrounds.
---
Yeah i should roll PVE, because having to stop PVPing near low skill pussies like you who exploit PVE items is what it means to PVP on a PVP server... makes a lot of sense, moron.
---
Yes ideally you will prioritize over spirit but there are times a big fat stat budget items comes your way all allocated to spirit so you say do I want the ring with 2 stamina or 7 spirit, etc.
---
Spirit is nice when you're running from point A to B amongst quests.
---
But yes, stam and int will do much better, along with having max food and water, in an ideal situation.
---
Depends on the other fury warrs in your guild. If they are all try yards with lionheart/chain/hoj/full hit then yeah you will not look as good. 
---
But if you just dinged 60 recently you’ll have an excuse.
---
This has really easy counterplay though, so only AoE spergs are gonna get hit by it. 
---
Just don’t sapper spam lol
---
Will you people stop linking to that fucking Wowhead post that is 3 months old??
---
Same, already cancelled my sub; I couldn't care less about a ban lol.
---
I've put a lot of time into trying to dig out the TBC ladders.
---
Unforunately the data is not out there except for bits and pieces like you've found there.
---
You can edit the battlegroup names, and some of the team links are click-able.
---
Some EU data exists as well.
---
I've also tried arenajunkies since that was the popular forum during TBC, but couldn't find much.
---
There have also been efforts in the past to amass the teams/players who got rank 1 in each bracket during TBC, much in the same way the community has tried to gather the guilds/dates for Vanilla Naxx clears.
---
I truly hope it is in classic as well then.
---
One involves you running back to your corpse as a ghost,  the other gives permanent dk. 
---
I got banned for forcing dks in vanilla by mindcontrolling civs. Downvote me for giving a warning, but you will definitely get banned. Idk.
---
Fury is definitely better because of 30% attack speed increase everytime u crit, that’s HUGE! And u will be critting a lot with raid buff.
---
oh no! the self-respecting pvp'ers will think im a loser.
---
I remember people really wanted rank 9 to get a stamina buff for tanks on world bosses.  That was the biggest thing for people, then BG's released before anyone had purple gear or rank 11 mounts.
---
Cry more, reroll PvE
---
Free rolls, at all, is the worst system out there.
---
Dkp is the best system and allows players to target loot they want while giving a sense of progression by earning dkp.
---
Never did i think i would have someone say free rolling is a good system, much less the best.  Lol wat?
---
Doesn't stack with sunder armour unfortunately.
---
I know it says civilian but can we see some proof that they actually yield dishonorable kills?
---
Also worth mentioning that I understand a lot of players here are frustrated with the state of PvP at the moment, but the honour system is grindy and tedious by nature. Gaming culture has changed a lot in 15 years and min maxing is a common thing now.
---
I'd highly recommend not trying to abuse this bug (assuming that it works) to get revenge on the other faction.
---
It's not a little better, it's quite a lot better.
---
Noone goes 9% . If you picked a bad race, you wear edgemasters and 6 hit. And since you alreasy broke devilsaur for edgemasters, BDS is definitely bis for all non weapon skill races.
---
Im assuming the guy has some raid gear so bds is likely bis for him. Unless his only raid gear is a deathbringer.
---
Naw just going to do what I'd say I was going to do.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wgsI8LW.png
---
Sure, but can't the same be said for the other servers? Doesn't matter which server I look at, just seems Horde cares more. Alliance is going to shred AV, but they don't seem to want to try in WPvP. Massive server pop differences are another story, but Heartseeker is not lacking in Alliance, by any means.
---
Sounds like you need a hug.
---
this isn't a one side thing thou. Horde are definitely going to be griefing the same way.
---
Fuck you Pink
---
Thanks for the input, I pretty much feel like this is the only real answer. It's kind of a shame that a company as large and successful as Blizzard never put in the time to document these records.
---
This is so convoluted and tedious its kind of hilarious.
---
You may as well just do dkp with the amount of maintenance required with this abomination of a loot system.
---
On retail this happened every single time I took a flightpath from the Alliance garrison to any other location in Draenor. Very immersive.
---
Imagine being that fucking stupid. What a bunch of scum!
---
Nah, on most populated server we have like 65% horde, its impossible atm to not get ganked in brm as ally.
---
KEKW boys
---
Please explain how?
---
Had been trying to solo the ulda outside quest most of that day(run by to see if horde and always was) kind of my goal for my day off
---
Not really...
---
and the reason you didnt post this weeks and weeks ago is because you enjoy your fellow alliance being farmed mercilessly?
---
I love when people find something beneficial, hold onto the info until the moment they think it may be changed or having its value/effectiveness reduced in some way, then tell everyone and strut around feeling great about themselves for helping people.
---
Doesn't really seem to be much room for interpretation in this one, lol.
---
That's pretty good advice. I leveled arms to ~57 and did the rest as prot because I couldn't bear arms any longer. Miss, parry, miss happens more often than you think and it fucking sucks.
---
there is so much more juicy gossip too
---
[https://i.imgur.com/1PIzMuN.png](https://i.imgur.com/1PIzMuN.png)

Merci!
---
What’s a Skull of Impending Doom then? Pretty sure it’s an item given by an npc for completing a pve quest and it’s great for pvp. Should they patch that?
---
Also jokes on you, muppets are awesome.
---
Damn man, our MT has two 60 wars one for PvP one for PvE. He has a binding on both, Sulf on the gnome. I'd say we've been incredibly lucky!
---
I'm not a fan of faction imbalance on either side.
---
Would you say warlock or mage are more "smooth" to play. I'm rerolling horde on the side, not as a main. I chose a realm but now I just have to choose between orc warlock or troll mage, but I dont like trolls aesthetics much, especially their mounts.
---
Lol no it won't
---
based on the video isn't it saying you switch back to your normal gear after equipping?  So you wouldn't be running around in full healing gear, just put it on, put weapon on, switch to normal gear, run around
---
Being 'garbage' at PVP is not synonymous with being the loser in constant outnumbered fights. Rather, thinking you're good at the game because you grief-camp the opposing outnumbered faction is pathetic. People are afraid of getting DHKs from this strategy so they're trying their best to convince others not to use it. But if you farmed your honor in non-griefing ways, you'd never have to worry. It's a revenge tactic for people ruining the game for others, camping spots endlessly,  and you're afraid of it.
---
You can guarantee it? 
---
Nice guarantee.
---
No joke, when that other user mentioned that the megathreads for questions/discussion is actually electing for the *opposite* to pop-up in regular posts, I passed it to the other mods immediately and we all had a "holy shit that user is right" moment.
---
Basically, we're actively working to re-arrange how we do daily threads and try to open discussion/questions/written content into their own posts, and encourage art/memes/fluff into stickies. Nothing official to announce yet, but *something* along these lines will happen.
---
Yeh for some reason Reddit UI was fucked. Looked like guy I responded to was responding in regards to yeti.

sure. so do it before the bg stars, and eat up. you have time.

Honestly a major reason I quit Classic is the readily available amount of information sort of killed the joy. Far too many people with "optimized paths, and gear, and rotations, and professions" killed any mystery that Classic was famous for.
---
If the warriors are geared correctly they will destroy rogues now, and for the rest of classic.
---
&gt;And how is roofcamping and exploit? Mindcontrol duels to remove honorless debuff
---
Because blizzard said they are. That's literally the one and only difference between something being an exploit and something being a cleaver use of game mechanics.
---
I guess I should have made it clear. This was intended with a class lead system in mind where you only manage 3-10 people not a whole 40man raid.
---
&gt; There are a number of explanations you can think up for various item price differences.
---
The only explanation I've seen so far is, "because it is useful during &lt;x&gt;".  An example would be NR gear.  Of course, the prices on those items will go "way up" when AQ is released because they are worthless now, and the only people who are selling them are doing so to make a quick buck on the DE market and aren't willing to hoard them until AQ.
---
If there are a number of explanation for a price of a currently traded commodity that will go up in value over time, then give me one?
---
By “tested,” do you mean you killed the NPC and 100% saw the dishonorable kill chat message? Or are you referring to the weak test here, where all you do is confirm that the mob shows as a civilian.
---
But paladins have offensive buffs AND defensive buffs.
---
If shammy totems applied to the whole raid, by all means I agree that shamans are better. 
---
But even as a warrior, I’d rather have salv might and kings over WFURY. Wfury is cool except when I crit proc it and die because my threat jumps from 40%. 
---
Last raid I drew the short stick and didn’t even have a fucking shaman because we ran out. No buffs for me! (Except hunter buff).
---
I hope you have decay, it helps against people like that.
---
Look at all the top parses, the priests are spamming flash heals in molten core. The 5-second-rule doesn't matter. As far as I'm concerned. There should be 4-5 paladins on tank heals, 4 priests on raid heals and one druid.
---
&gt; I think Venture was the 2nd guild that moved yes 
---
Rofl ok, get your shit straight
---
i actually laughed out loud
---
It is 100% unavoidable in BGs however. Any form of a DK in a BG is downright fucked up.
---
No clue - my experience has only been with Heartseeker where it’s clear there’s one group of Horde players that are extremely devoted to the high warlord grind. I don’t who on Alliance shares that same level of zeal. Most of the people I’ve spoken with are shooting for rank 8-10, because unless you’re playing like a hybrid class or arms warrior, the T1/T2 sets are better or comparable to most of the rare shit you can get anyways. If you’re not going for high warlord/grand marshal - you’re better off just PvEing in general. You’ll get better gear for less effort, and you’ll be able to roll anyone who’s stuck in rares once BWL comes out.
---
I'm not an expert on how honor works, but sometimes it seems like I get a credit for HKs pop up when I am just nearby someone getting killed despite not touching them or being in a group with the people who are doing the killing. If DKs get associated like that then it is a big problem
---
IT DOESNT WORK, KEEP KILLING THERE IS NO DHK, OP IS LYING
---
Nothing a heal or potion can't fix.
---
There's plenty to be discussed, is everyone here on this reddit a WoW Classic master?  No they're not.  There's a lot of new players or people who don't remember shit from 15 years ago.  
---
I had an argument with someone about Combat Daggers being the top DPS raid spec for Rogues.  They swore vehemently that it was Combat Swords.  
---
Everything isn't known to everyone.  Thinking that everyone who plays Classic knows everything about the game is straight up ignorant and hurting reddit and the game itself.
---
Just because they're unpaid volunteers doesn't mean they shouldn't be held to standards, they chose to be mods, if they aren't doing the job they volunteered for, get someone else who will.
---
There is literally no reason to leave a mob unbannished during this fight. You can recast it during the last second of the current banish, chaining it to the point where the mob basically doesn't move the entire fight. Anyone who is playing warlock and so obsessed about their dps meter that they let a banish drop should go play mage.
---
I remember back in like BC (maybe wrath), I made a level 1 priest and swam out there. I can't remember exactly when, but there was a period to where your mana would regenerate fast enough that you could keep yourself healed even through fatigue damage. Only worked under level like 5. It was really cool
---
If the eye gives a DK, it is an instant cast, and could be used before a Cone of Cold in 1v1 for example. It's not just "AoE Spergs".
---
People were banned for the "clever use of game mechanics" involving layering. Hence the _entire_ point of this comment chain, which is that this is likely an exploit and you *might* get banned for consistently doing it.
---
&gt;Premades would be horrible for the PUG BG experience. 
---
Yes, certainly. Unless you don't want to get a horrible experience in BG, please do not PUG.

---
Shhhhh they gonna roll on our shit!
---
I think that's debatable. Everyone I know does the jump when solo, the only difference for the Horde would be doing it with a group. I'm not sure how long it takes others to make the jump but I can do it without abilities in about a minute and even faster if I use levitate. But hey, just trying to share an alternate method, fuck me right?
---
Their motives are a bit deeper than this as well. The people actually bidding are not receiving any deals and are infighting over every piece. While the mage blade in this example will go for an insane value as well, they're going to get it, and the reality is many more won't drop, but the rest of the items probably will.
---
There's lots of ways to look at this, but hoarding an iconic piece is strategic in its own right.
---
Okay do you really think that eye should be a civilian kill?
---
I doubt people I subbed bro, take your doomsay somewhere else. Definitely there’d be less activity from non pvp players, but most likely they raid log and run dungeons and join the odd pvp group
---
If you are choosing WOTF in case you happen to face one class who may or may not have the right pet out and on the off chance you don't have any dots on you to break seduce AND you don't have a priest/palidan to dispel you.... IDK what to tell you
---
Pulling a mammoth out of my backpack is also 100% incorrect in the real world. 
---
Who cares about familiar faces? If you want to play against people you know, go play fortnight.
---
Nah mate you should see the amount of 60s selling runs and soloing the dungeon in 5-8 minutes I watched a few movies yesterday and went 16-25
---
If we invite a fresh mage that we don’t know and they end up winning 2 pieces and dip for a further progressed guild, that sucks. DKP rewards players accourdingly for being reliable and successful. It motivates people to show up on time, do well in raids, donate requisitions to supply the guild, and if they don’t win pieces they still walk away with more DKP and the winners have less. It keeps people around because they’re constantly progressing towards their gear and the guild performs better when there’s a system that rewards them for being reliable.
---
None of the guilds on my server require pre bis unless you are in a competitive progression guild (which is totally moot currently, except for cracking speed run timers for MC or soemthing)
---
Also, seen plenty of tauren, orc, troll even if the majority are undead.
---
I dunno man, I am frustrated with some things about classic, but I dont feel like your argument here is accurate at all.
---
So you are claiming people who aren’t either aware of their target, or who AOE without being aware of their surroundings, should be advocated for? Nah, play the game well or take the DK.
---
From my own experience that is not currently the case with people being able to openly view other peoples item list. If you see that multiple people are going to pick up mageblade you can concede it to those players and just go for other desired pieces. Thats currently how its working with the 6 players I manage.
---
Nevwr downrank to rank 1 heal. Only go to rank 2.
---
I don't think merging all servers was ever a consideration. People like seeing the same opponents in PvP every now and again which would be virtually impossible if you combined the ~million people playing all into one server.
---
Queue times were nonexistent with the battlegroup approach in vanilla, also.
---
ya I'm upset that I spend all day crying on reddit about quitting the game i suck at
---
It's HIPAA
---
We do have decay, the people with that much DKP are just being dumb and they suffer the consequences (So does the guild but whatever we’re in MC and others are still getting loot)
---
dummies don't work
---
Yup, idk how he can make that comment while playing in a +1 roll guild.  The exact system that does not take number of runs into account when distributing loot.  I can't fathom complaining like this while shooting yourself in the foot.  Hates rng, continues raiding under a heavily rng based loot system rofl.
---
Warlocks are heavily gear dependent.
---
&gt; Is it possible to start as a night elf druid in the human starting location or will the class quests be too hard to do because of all the backtracking? 
---
You can't start there, but if you have a mage friend or have some gold sent to your toon, you can just ask a mage for a portal to Stormwind and go to their starting zone.
---
&gt;I know there are druid trainers in Stormwind but do they give the quests?
---
I don't know if they give quests, but there's only 3 real important ones you need to pick up (Bear/Poison Cure/Aquatic form), and I do know that some of those send you to Darkshore/Westfall so you'll be doing some traveling regardless. 
---
For what it's worth, this is only going to be temporary issue for a few hours until you get to level 10, then you'll get the Moonglade teleport, so if you set your hearth to SW you can easily get between Darnassus/SW without massive runs.  
---
The teleport is a static 120 mana, uses no reagent and has no cooldown, so traveling between continents is very easy for a druid.
---
It doesn't stack with Fairie Fire, stacks just fine with Sunder.
---
I don't see that working given that outside of set pieces there are a LOT of pieces that are good across several classes.
---
DKP or Loot Council
---
Stop over complicating loot.
---
top warlocks? u guys r no names get ppl with some actual respect like seuche or goth.
---
I have my own set list for my class locked 72 hours before raid starts to prevent that.
---
That guild was created specifically to thumb it's nose at the honor system and literally wipe out entire zones.  We changed the faction balance on our server through open recruitment.  It was heavy alliance but we recruited on the forums and had an obscene number of rerolls come to our server to play with us...like we broke the "unique accounts" value in the guild window (we were well over 500 unique accounts in the guild).  
---
We could, and would, stage 5-6 full raid groups and designate zones to simply take over and just keep every single NPC dead.  
---
We made a guild policy that everyone needed a level 20 (I think it was?) Warlock.  We then mass rushed them into IF and found out of the way, empty, buildings to log out the survivors who made it in side.  The one night we logged them all in and summoned the entire guilds worth of mains into IF.  We kept the IF Flightmaster dead for nearly 12 hours (he would repawn after 3-5 minutes).  Any alliance that wanted to leave IF did it on foot...
---
It was an amazing time.
---
Just did it and no DHK, alright OP, show the screenshots
---
Being on a balanced server where theres constant struggles across the world the pure seething rage i see in this subreddit is hilarious. Both ally and horde on my server fear going into brm or lights hope you never know who has control
---
A winter season pass here is $1709, before tax. The season is, if you're extremely lucky, 4 months. That's 427/month assuming you incur absolutely no other related costs and don't pay tax.
---
Main tank got the same binding the week before
---
I have my list lockins 72 hours in advance
---
You need to be a warlock for soulstone (or shaman for ankh), you need atleast 3 so you'd have to have 3 different locks set up at checkpoints inside the fatigue water waiting for you. Theoretically possible but a logistical nightmare.
---
Hit over cap is still valuable, especially for speed runs, where the added consistency is desirable.
---
Your gryphon was just aware of the shortcut at mountain 9 and 3/4
---
The smile sample quest for felwood is pretty bad... makes you gather slime samples to use in this kit in undercity, where you get the quest from. To avoid having to go all the way back to felwood you have to gather 50 or more of the fucking things and bring them back. Such a stupid design, just give us the kit to use while we're in felwood ffs...
---
&gt; self respecting pvper
---
lmao like the horde who consistently gank people in IF, only take fights when they have a 5 to 1 advantage, and farm all the major flight paths and paths to dungeons. 
---
Clever use of game mechanics. Cry more.
---
Idk man, even at 53 with 3% hit on my gear as an orc I was still missing way too much to feel comfortable or good
---
Is this honor trading or organized stacking? It doesn't seem like you could gain a significant amount of honor this way. OTOH stacking is just good common sense.
---
Depending on the server this is most definitely a one side thing. Funny joke 100+ alliance ALIVE in the mountain. [Haha! You funny man!](https://i.imgflip.com/l04he.jpg)
---
That's the thing though, you miss more often yes, but you're also attacking 4x as often. Leveling my warrior as arms I couldn't even see why it was a valid complaint because you still miss and that 3.8 second wait when you're at 4 rage and don't have an overpower proc is terrible. If missing as fury feels that bad just do the heroic strike queuing "feature."
---
My server is pvp and even split.
---
I'd be all for it tbh -- but its ganna be battlegroups (well probably by region) so w/e.
---
That appears to be what the video is showing and is the experience of almost everyone playing the game except for some reason apparently like one server is not extremely unbalanced towards the horde. I am certain on the Incendius server it is extremely unpleasant to be alliance and the entire world is a flood of red names and you can not live for more than 5 minutes in winterspring at 5am literally.
---
The only data I have seen to suggest that horde does not outnumber alliance 100:1 is self-reporting discord surveys. These numbers can be incorrect if people voluntarily go and say what faction and server they are. Because when the are unfairly stomping everyone they don't want to learn about how they are basically cheating, and in contrast the alliance do want to learn how they are being cheated. That means if we are talking about voluntary surveys, participation will heavily come from whoever is outnumbered, thereby decreasing the appearance of how outnumbered they are.
---
Bro this qpon guy is a mage on Smolderweb, he and two dumb friends think that ganking flagged lowbies at the AH and dying to the guards 24/7 is "PvP" so you can just disregard everything he says.
---
gladiator kcolraw here ANY DEATHWING HOMIES IN THE HOUSE???
---
Yeah, 48+ is a dead zone pretty much.
---
Reread the first thing OP wrote, lol
---
I am going to abuse the ever living fuck out of this.
---
I am tired of seeing annoying fucking horde camp a FP that give 0 honor for hours.
---
Rofl, someone do their best posting the discord reveals
---
Are you using the highest rank of your spells? It doesn't update automatically when you train a new rank. You have to put the highest rank onto your bar in place of the previous rank.
---
&gt;Now let's all fly to Kargath, Thorium Point, or Burning Steppes. Immediately upon landing...yep you guessed it. Getting killed by 5-9+ alliance.
---
Blizzard opened transfers, from Four realms to Heartseeker, and had no shutoff, if the ratio got too bad. They literally let the ratio get out of wack.
---
I'm not a fan of cross-server at all, but if it must happen then Battlegroups are a decent compromise. It allows them to group servers that have offsetting faction imbalances to minimize queues, and also groups servers based on time zones to manipulate how consistent queues are throughout the day. 
---
Another issue is the premade factor; you want to group the biggest servers together for more level competition, as its much easier to form a premade on a big server than a small one.
---
It is true while leveling because you will lack the +hit% to make DW stronger.
---
PvP hAPpEneD oN a PvP ReAlM. You realize that 3500 horde vs 500 alliance is not ok. Especially when there are no bgs and people have to go world pvp. In normal server where its close to 50/50, like 45/55 sure thats just normal pvp but anything other than that is just horde griefing. In Shazzrah EU its like 30/70 in favor of horde. There simply isn't enough alliance to even hope of fighting back. It takes any non stealthy class 20+ corpseruns from TP to get to BRS, forget SG as alliance.
---
People who are 60 but have "nothing to do" are the reason why alliance are getting massacred.
---
If they take their thumbs out of their ass, and start fighting, maybe the servers would be better off.
---
Nice blog, where can i follow it?
---
Do you play or just read reddit posts to form your opinion?  Reddit will always be a polarized version of any given opinion.
---
I play on Grobb US and while there are still regular gank squads in BRM and high population end-game zones, it certainly has died down significantly from the first week.  The first week, EVERYWHERE was an absolute bloodbath.
---
But it's not a bug.
---
1.	No
---
2.	no
---
3.	yes
---
4.	no transfer
---
5.	no
---
The ones complaining are probably the weaker ones at 50-60 or under geared etc. Ofc you’re gonna get farmed so get a group, walk to dungeons together. People solo run to dungeons die over and over and wonder why they can’t get there. If you quest then be smart and quest at odd hours or at odd places. Hardly anyone roam around the lower parts of ungoro and azhara.
---
Smacking stuff with a 2h go 25/26 protection ret, unkillable healer go 31/20 holy protection, well rounded go 31/20 holy ret this is also your best duel spec
---
Yeah, dunno why they would've locked it when you posted it unless they thought you were me.. I spoke with them and I have to have a 9:1 ratio I guess (9 non video posts for every video) and comments don't count for that. 
---
Oh well I guess. video links on my profile if anyone wants to see it
---
Oh I completely agree but that's not the servers fault, Sulfuras is the most balanced pvp server right now, its definitely cancer trying to get into BRD but I promise that's not just an ally issue. Its cause of assholes, cant say I blame people. Classic is the only mmo where you the game let's you actually ruin another players day haha. Which is kinda what makes it so unique
---
They should have flown planes full of alliance players over the fires in Australia, they would have extinguished those fires in seconds.
---
LUL HE DELETED THE POST CAUSE IT DOESNT WORK
---
No self-respecting pvper plays classic wow to rank in it though. Arena is where respectable pvp happens. Anything outside is just for the lols.
---
YOUR CONFESSION IS THAT YOUR FIRST WORD IS A TYPO.
---
They aren't people
---
I remember queue times at one point in TBC being brutal.  I was on a dead server and cant recall what battlegroup (must have been low pop).  I think this was a few months before Wrath.  It was horrible.  
---
Now if every server out there was on the same battlegroup, then wait times would have been a non issue.  
---
As for the "familiar faces" comment.  We already have such high pop servers.  I doubt people will be recognizing opposing faction players very easily even with smaller battle groups.  
---
Bottom line - creating battle groups will result in higher wait times vs everyone being on the same battle group.
---
why isnt this post banned? this is a witch hunt thread. fuck op, little whiney bitch.
---
It isn’t a player given DHK if they don’t kill it though. It’s a way to block mindless AoE spam.
---
Nope, there is like ... maby 6 bad pvp servers per major region to avoid.
---
A lot of the pvp servers are actually quite even and don't have massive populations.
---
check the youtube comments, they are both in there
---
Zezanje creates a Mageweave Bandage.
---
THIS is why the eagles couldnt be trusted with The One Ring. eagles/gryphons...buncha drunks
---
Was getting real 9/11 vibes from the first few seconds of the video
---
People say classic is more about your reputation and stuff but how are we suppose hold those accountable to if everything is blurred out? But oh if it's something about streamer? Sound the alarms
---
Sure, but that requires Revered in WSG -- so prior to playing your twink for months its the best item.
---
Yes.
---
Damn, this shit was deleted.
---
Or we don't really like pvp, but rolled on this server to long time friends that do, who have all since quit, and now we are stuck here with no where to go.
---
&gt; I had 7 people pass on staff of domination and sorceress dagger just to try to get a mageblade. 
---
Sorcerous I understand, it's not that great. But I'd totally take SoD if I had the opportunity, mostly because I have terrible luck on both drops and rolls. 
---
I assume you also have a rule that no one with a SoD can roll on Mageblade.
---
Also known as the upvote
---
noone cares
---
You've just proved my point.  Every time you slice the players into smaller groups, you increase wait times.  ET vs PT servers could different populations, faction imbalances etc, which would result in certain players waiting longer than others.    
---
Merging all servers would result in the least amount of waiting times for all players.
---
&gt;I think that's debatable. Everyone I know does the jump when solo, 
---
Everyone you know did Test of Skulls solo?
---
&gt;But hey, just trying to share an alternate method, fuck me right?
---
Being a smartass and providing unhelpful information based on your assumption was really unnecessary, so basically, yeah.
---
Just roll a PvE server if you cannot handle the risk of getting DK's? Isnt that the standard response to any issue these days.
---
youwa shock!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10837/tooth-of-eranikus is probably a pretty good and obtainable MH at level 50.  Could also look into BRD for something like Grizzles Skinner or Dawn's Edge (it's a boe blacksmithing wep) if you can get the mats for it.  If you're really rich, Axe of the Deep Woods / Flurry Axe are your BiS MH/OH pre-raid.
---
Put your Thrash Blade in your OH.
---
That seems silly too. I really don’t the point in punishing people for getting gear. 
---
You gonna have people pass on upgrades because they don’t want to get punished rolling for a better item later on in the raid.
---
I'm in AV to get rep for the tabard, and the mount.  Everything else can eat a bag of dicks.
---
You speak for every ally? They control diremaul, strat, sit outside UC etc on Fairbanks.  They do it bc they want honor.
---
I already fed 6 dhks to the strat campers. They left LOL
---
It’s fair if they camp 4 times max. More than that are really scum
---
&gt;with literally no chance at counter play
---
Except for, you know, not braindead Blizzard spamming all day. Shock, horror!
---
How effective is +hit for a fury warrior after you hit the +9%?  Does +hit become significantly worse after that point, or is it still a good dps boost?
---
It's very easy I believe, you just gotta get the right modelviewer to work and the export is good - sadly, no IK legs, but he works around that just fine :) Looking forward to seeing your stuff here!
---
Oh okay then let them have fun. I am a warrior and I understand the desire to keep for a weapon lol.
---
you are really angry about a video game, you know that?
---
Read this 3 times, still couldnt find the point you were trying to make... (i.e. where pulling a mammoth out of your backpack meets the best design for the lowest wait times).
---
Pvp on a pvp server :)
---
Maybe similar to the multipart [Cortello's Riddle](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=624/cortellos-riddle).
---
av is ruined anyway, it's a pve rush.
---
Keep trying.
---
Morgraine has been 32% A/H 68% over last 7 days so youve been unlucky
---
I thought it was more fun that horde were complaining about Menethil guards. I assumed that was a joke.
---
They don't deter anything. On my server going on the menethil boat means a minimum of 3 deaths every single trip. Usually more like 5.
---
My crew found an essence of undeath to water.  I paid my buddy who won the roll 250g and have been pumping out waters since.  Shame the price per has been dropping from 25g a month ago to now about 17g
---
Anywhere I can go to check? I don't think Blizzard publishes any kind of official player counts do they?
---
&gt; a major reason I quit Classic 
---
What does other people having an optimized path have to do with you and why you quit?  You can quest and level and run dungeons without using google or wowhead or questie or whatever.  Others use of those in no way effects your game play and your experience.
---
I’m so happy I rolled on a pve server lol atiesh ganggg
---
Bro yeah what’s up in the video??? Get you a full green set of +healing, second wind, briarwood reed, animated chain necklace. Take advantage of this lol. This is the only time I’ve been jealous of paladins as a shaman.
---
Thats defeatism, you should be out there fighting for your people, and if you can't beat them fairly, at least you can go to stonetalon or ashenvale.
---
So fish are much cheaper than they were on private servers in general.
---
Oily Blackmouth, Stonescale Eel, NIghtfin, pretty much any fish is cheap af.
---
Some suggested that stonescales are just easier to catch than before (not true at all in my experience).  Others have said that pools spawn more frequently which again doesn't really hold true in my experience. I think it has to do with just so many more people in the game fishing stuff up trying to make money.
---
Enchanting mats tend to be cheaper than private as well. More people active on the server increases the supply I guess? Can you think of an alternate reason?
---
Eye of Shadow is much cheaper.
---
Sinew is a lot more expensive than I remember.
---
Devilsaur leather is about the same but fluctuates a bit more. The mafia on private had much tighter control of the market. Especially since pvp came out, I think they are struggling to hold ungoro.
---
These are just a few examples I thought up on the spot.
---
I like how you left out the part where I mentioned that the horde would require a group, but you're welcome to call me names for trying to let you know there was another way to get to the back of the cave.
---
Eh you're sounding kind of "you think you do"-ey there bud. I have had an absolute blast in classic pvp, in the mid 40s we had an epic standoff in the tanaris pirate town, it instantly took me back to the wow pvp days of over a decade ago. Its cool if you personally wanna roll pve but old school pvp is definitely a thing again. Nothing like this happens in modern wow and I haven't had this much fun in Pvp in like the recent 5 expansions.
---
Only one I can offer that I know is good off the top of my head is PvP East US Sulfuras.
---
killed one earlier, didnt give a dhk
---
Lmaooooooo.... but really
---
cant get thrash blade til 45
---
Huge in Japan still
---
We need recurring logs of your exploits, this was some good content!
---
Vanq's Sword(aka Vanquisher's Sword because I was too lazy to type the whole thing haha) is from the RFD quest.
---
Good news for ally on horde heavy pvp servers. Gunna be a lot of salty horde :D
---
This happened to me to did it take you to IronForge at least? My gryphon fixed its pathing after some while in the mountain.
---
Sounds like battlefield on that jail map where people would just grab the LMGs and spam fire down the hall. You were bound to get kills.
---
Thats mc bro, 3 fights are literally under 20 seconds
---
&gt;level 2I\_ama\_Borat
---
Yup, every duel i let warriors get their charge, mage/hunter get their range, rogue/druid get their stealth etc. 
---
Always pretotem! lol thats our thing
---
It depends if you need the 2 piece set bonus to get hit-capped.  If you have edgemaster's you aren't getting the 2 piece bonus (2% to hit) then you need less to be hit capped, so eldritch would make sense.  Devilsaur is awesome stuff for hit and crit, but if you have edgemaster's you aren't getting the 2 hit set bonus, so definitely never use devilsaur without the set bonus.  
---
Honestly, BIS lists people follow are finely tuned for exact gear, the key is getting hit cap and then stacking AP (strength or AP) and crit (agility or % crit) whatever gear gets you hit capped + AP and Crit.
---
I like to push crit as much as possible, because with a 2h fury on horde, crits + wind fury = massive rage generation.  Honestly, it is up to you to try out different combos.
---
Honestly though, PVP up and get the PVP blue set, it is very good.  The chest/helm are like 90% of SGC and lionheart.
---
Sounds like your whining about pvp on a pvp server.
---
Then this would be for you. There might not be any new places but i wrote some "custom lore" and you might see something you haven't seen before.
---
You literally have servers on the brink of a mass exodus where players no longer give a fuck about the "health" of the community, through the actions of one or another group who have decided to make the game unplayable for the hell of it.
---
I get it that Blizzard fucked up with so many people, etc...  
---
BUT...
---
You're asking one group of people to not go "fuck it, let it burn" while another group starts jumping up and down yelling "LET'S BURN THIS BITCH TO THE GROOOOUUUUUUNNNNNDDDDD!"
---
It's guerrilla warfare, and I love it.  Don't form a raid, don't farm chokepoints, don't exert an overwhelming advantage.
---
Or you'll get suicide bombers.
---
I really think this game tends towards inflation not deflation. Theres so much gold flowing into the economy from farming, and really not that much going out.
---
Bonesnapper is required level 48.
---
FYI if you have a second monitor you can make that your monitor 1, play on this and the other monitor will have the “activate windows” nonesense. That is if you don’t actually feel like activating it
---
Atiesh if you wanna play alliance! Good server
---
While paladins may be able to buff a whole raid; their buff's damage output pales in comparison to a shamans buff's damage output. The argument was that paladins makes pve easy mode. I believe more dps is easy mode and windfury + bloodlust &gt; all blessings in the damage output .
---
It’s not about punishing a person for winning gear though, even though it happens.  It’s about a more even distribution.  I won 2, 2 other pallies won 1, and one person got 0.  If this system wasn’t in place, I would have come in as a PUG and taken 4 items from their 3 guildies, how is that fair at all to them?

UM HELLO #nochanges that means everything was perfect so do not even type a suggestion because it is a waste of reddit's bandwidth
---
Can someone convert this to freedom units?
---
&gt; “You got this good item. Now you wait 1 month for your next item because you have no dkp”
---
I'd love to get one piece of gear a month. I'm at about 10 weeks of raiding and have gotten one boss drop.
---
Healcomm shows incoming heals, also from other healers if they have the addon.
---
That boss is so easy I actually cant talk about it because I know nothing about its mechanics lmfao
---
You're forgetting that you only need 1 BG's worth of players available to queue to have no queue time. It's not about having the most players queueing at the same time, it's about having an equal number of players from each faction queueing at the same time.
---
I think people who do that should be permanently banned for exploiting.
---
Blizzard bending the knee to China didn't do it for most people.
---
Good.
---
Maybe you should roll alliance and show them how’s it’s done then!
---
I was in Vicious Cycle on Agamaggan in Vanilla, so I can confirm that they existed on that server also. Our raid leader(not sure if GM also) was a warlock named Lunchmoney during my time there.
---
If you're loving Shadow then you can keep it all the way up to raiding if you want, though I would recommend switching to either holy or disc/holy when you start wanting to run Scholo/Strat. At that point you're nearly there and they are also dungeons that can be tricky.
---
If all of your pulls go smooth you can heal them as Shadow, but there's a lot of mobs tightly packed in there and being disc/holy can come in clutch.
---
You could get a muggers belt from Diremaul North and use a couple of blue dungeon daggers until you can afford edgemasters.
---
I totally agree, it adds another layer to pvp encounters and helps mitigate the current situation. People like to use the "intent" defense to counter this point (blizzard never intendes for DHK to work this way!), well, it goes both ways (blizzard never intended world pvp to be as unbalanced as it is currently)
---
How come the chat is laggy as fuck right now then?
---
ai de sora ga ochite kuru
---
When they weren't, lvl 60's were wiping out low level quest hubs on repeat.
---
No bloodlust in vanilla, but if it did exist I’d agree.
---
Problem is you have to choose between threat reduction and wfury. Right now it’s not a big deal but when fury warriors actually start getting raid gear that doesn’t suck... 
---
I’m ripping aggro from rag occasionally in nothing but prebis, even if I wait a few seconds if I get unlucky with crits and wfury.
---
My you're a tall one!
---
Do you think if people are in a 20v20 that they should all be single targetting? Do you think if a mage is fighting a hunter that they should be hard casting frostbolts instead of using their instant damage? (arcane explosion)
---
What this guy said. And even more important than the weapons is that you are wearing as much hit gear as you can get, because at level 50, that might only be one or two pieces.
---
Sometimes RNG just sucks. I'm at revered with AD, haven't turned in a single stone, and I've only seen it drop twice. Lost both times as it was a pug
---
Why would you do that?... BM at it's finest. Shame on you and your guild OP
---
LFG Strat UD!
---
&gt;People say classic is more about your reputation and stuff but how are we suppose hold those accountable to if everything is blurred out?
---
On your own server you're more than free to do it and encouraged to do so, but this is not your server, it's reddit. Go post this on your servers discord, advertise it on your trade channels, tell everyone you know in game, just not here. 
---
&gt;But oh if it's something about streamer? 
---
Streamer shit is also against the rules:
---
"This is not a community for private servers, current World of Warcraft, **streamer drama**"
---
Problem is that people like OP love posting this shit anyway.
---
It's very similar.  You can't check wowhead for this one though :)
---
Opposite for me, trying to get the pattern and have gotten 2 sinews. I only try to farm when a hunter needs the sinew so it goes faster.
---
techically after the BG u spawn back in the city. re-que. so u would travel back to menthil harbor.
---
smarty.
---
Your wrong on the pve part. Alliance is the stronger faction in pve due to paladins.
---
Alliance are also arguably the stronger faction in organized pvp due to paladins.
---
For anything else pvp related Horde is superior imo.. but it’s just racials... no biggie
---
Well i am curious about the numbers between 2h fury and arms for alliance where MS is allowed. Anyone know if there is a comparion somewhere ? 
---
Another question is, I have spinal reaper and arms now, if i switch to fury, do you suggest using slam ? Or slam spec is totally useless ? 
---
I read that using slam between swings is good, but feel like my swing resets after slam ? 
---
Thanks in advance..
---
Oh yeah i'm sure it is that way, its more of a nuisance than anything.  Luckily BG's will be out soon so i'll have those to do instead once I grind out these last 2 levels.
---
I believe this used to work in retail but was purposefully broken, so I expect it would not work in classic either. I also don't recall anything like that in Vanilla, so I can't think of any arguments for it to work/be available.
---
Ah I remember this channel. RIP, his content is great.
---
Report them to blizz and carry on. There’s nothing I can do as someone on a different server with literally zero in game interaction with these players
---
ATATATATTATATATATATATATATATATATATATA
---
WOOPAH
---
I also play horde on one of the most 50 50 servers on all US, Sulfuras. Alliance chronically have farm groups everywhere.
---
Shifting costs us more mana than it costs you mages
---
Kick with a nice, “ You think I forgot bitch? Whose Thunderfury is that now?! Peace!” 
---
*kRushin has been kicked from the guild
---
That's why I have like 1000 Screenshots with the mount and tittle. Nothing felt better back in the day. Working all year and being a god amongst peasants and pve dragonslaying nerds
---
If you go holy/reckoning for the luls in pvp, the redoubt procs will still notify you of when you have some reck stacks to blow
---
I don't really find it fun or rewarding. I don't go out to farm level 1 mobs for the same reason.
---
Good thing it has 5 seconds cast then I guess :)
---
Fair point.  Yeah I'd say you're screwed on the helm for a long long time.
---
In other news I had the same complex as you after never getting the T2 helm in vanilla, and two weeks ago I passed on it to give it to someone else who needed it more.  It was a pretty nice feeling.  Also it helped that I have the crown of destruction off rag, so I dont need the t2 helm  until I get 7/8 t2.  (Hunter gear in classic, warrior in vanilla)
---
Nethergarde Keep mate, alliance
---
I get harrassed/ganked in Felwood and Burning Steppes by multiple people even when I try open-world farming at 2AM-4AM server time. I honestly hope BGs will change this but I'm afraid my expectations may be too high.
---
This can be used by all who can equip 2h sword.
---
You got one of those Mongo gryphons.
---
2h slam fury, no debuff slot taken by ms
---
There is no way giving DHKs to players is an intended use of the item.  Steering one into the middle of a fight with the sole intention of causing DHKs (an unintended use) which also happens to cause damage to who you are using it against (in the form of a dishonorable kill) is like the textbook gaming definition of an exploit.  
---
Also zip it with the ad hominem.  That's not going to get us anywhere.
---
Shortcut!
---
Briarwood Reed and Eye of Beast are the best two trinkets for pve right now.  You need the +2% crit for more improved shadow bolt procs in raid even if it isn't immediately obvious that 2% crit would be better than 23 spell power. 
---
DM quest trink is not bad, might actually be better for dungeons for aggro management if you are super geared, but the difference is fairly low and not worth carrying both around.  I had reed/eye before DM came out and have no intention of going to get the royal seal, not really worth the bother IMO.  There's a reason the book is so cheap on the AH, no one cares.
---
and at that point you might aswell go with a council.
---
'' bob get the mageblade, but frank get the ToEP and richard get the choker''
---
Discipline priest with dps/heal build, does it work?
---
What about things like cone of cold or multi-shot? Abilities that are used in 1v1 but still can hit multiple targets?
---
Dude in my raid we have a regrowth specced druid. It takes 6 regrowths for him to go oom, he pops innervate after 15 secs, pots after that and ends the fight with 40 hps because he is just standing aroujs
---
9% for pvp and 5% for pve.
---
“I know a shortcut.”
---
Shortcut:
---
for a dual wielding class (rogues and warriors) the dual wield hitcap around 25%, its basically unreachable. as a rogue a huge portion of your damage (like &gt;50%) is normal white auto attacks. more hit always helps this
---
also the gear with hit on it is often the best gear anyway because of other stats or set bonuses
---
Suicide kings works as well. It's pretty effective and not that time consuming. It has the drawback of DKP where people save their bids, and only scoop up the best stuff in the tier and never scoop up very needed upgrades.
---
Loot council causes drama pretty often if not done well.
---
DKP causes people to hoard DKP and never spend it, then just scoop up a bunch of top-tier things, while the rest of their gear is TRASH.
---
Every loot system has a drawback, but each has +'s and -'s.
---
Found the guy on a balanced server
---
Will do when I get home.
---
Yeah, no problem.
---
Sulfuras is a good server
---
Greifing greifers is fucking justice
---
I'm not sure that's correct...
---
Yea...thanks, I think I will walk after all.
---
Feral spec is fine but feral gear isn't. You need stam/intel gear, with +sp even better.
---
Yep same here. Seeing the horde get so mad before it even starts is getting me excited.
---
Fair enough, they are both worth farming, but I got real sick of arena anger runs, still might pick up the lion heart helm though. It is better and bis basically forever.
---
If you get a big 2hander from mc go fury slam spec, use hoj, and use the new slam macro going around. It is insane.
---
The render distance was already trash. This sucks.
---
My guild has an attrition rate of roughly 40-60% at this point compared to two weeks after launch. A lot of them did stop playing before phase 2 though.
---
Seems like an average night. Horde outnumbering Alliance in unfair PvP setting and still not achieving their goals. If this follows the pattern of most Horde I see, they'll start cheating next by standing on rooftops or buying gold online to try to get their revenge.
---
Lmao same. People want to run around as a raid and flex their epeen but get mad when they all get punished for doing so
---
You shut your mouth. Don't take this from me.
---
I hope Kevinb70 came back and is enjoying Classic with us all
---
Sounds dope ! What’s the new macro if I may ask?
---
Post logs i could easily tell you whats up. You should be doing better than rogues unless there is a massive gear disparity.
---
Ganked by two rogue.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/
---
elitist? wtf are you talking about? You are being whiny over freaking loot and considering quitting over it. How much of a baby are you? if anyones "mental" is to be questioned, it is yours. jeez
---
It's been addressed.
---
Look, in a month from Tuesday when BGs are launched, people are going to take to Reddit to complain about one another or another and be ready to burn the place down.
---
The world PVP situation is a classic example.  There were end results here that were not properly thought out which resulted in a clusterfck.  Clearly WPVP is broken because of faction imblance and higher server populations (imagine someone thought about that beforehand???).  Blizz made some bad mistakes, and I'm trying to speculate about what can go wrong with the introduction of BGs.
---
Why dont you post some ideas where mistakes can be made vs just trolling lol.  Come up with some scenarios.  All I'm saying is that battle groups will create longer wait times, which I dont think is good if you want to grow the player base (people have quit over the state of WPVP).  
---
Anything that grows the player base is good for the game IMO.
---
a couple times when i land from a flight, enemy casts detect magic on me...why is that?
---
caster offhand is goat
---
Cramer#5712, hit me up or PM me the deets!
---
Here is the honest truth. No decent guild will ever take someone as a tank they dont know. Tanks are the most important person in a guild and if the tanks bails or quits, it screws the entire guild. If you want to tank, you need to join as a DPS, establish trust and you will get your chance eventually. Prove yourself. 
---
If you find a guild that will take you as a tank without knowing you, they are shit or desperate.. either way spell trouble.
---
This doesn't work for me. What am I doing wrong?
---
That's 1 guild. Korkron/tree glow/ashes and at least 3 other horde guilds are constantly in EPL wintersrping menethil etc.
---
Six million intelligence quotient.
---
The item is marked as a civillian, which is a flag that Blizzard manually had to set. There is no evidence it is not intended beyond you just thinking so, and I am sorry but your feelings aren't an argument.
---
There is no ad hominem, you don't need to get so defensive. I'm characterizing the attitude that you are putting forth - Blizzard should not shelter you from your mistakes (AoEing mindlessly into an eye). This is World of WARCraft, not World of MindlessAoECraft or World of BlizzardProtectMePlzCraft, after all.
---
Just adapt and play better. Use your single target spells, like Mind Blast. While they are using their eye they have no control of their character - use that to your advantage!
---
They made it so that ganking people near dungeons is dishonorable now. There was a post on the forum.
---
he likely means he has the majority of his points in the aff tree
---
like a SM/Ruin lock
---
Oh a Wrath Gladiator. I hear ya buddy — I was county champion of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, and I also hate when vanilla players go on about PvP like they know what they’re talking about.
---
Make them implode Kek
---
Then what is going to stop level 60s from decimating Goldshire or Crossroads. Imaging playing on your first character and you make it to goldshire and every single quest giver is dead.
---
Don't believe them, Plo. Keep trying to gank at the IF bridge. I absolutely love the free honor from you and Qpon
---
What about a form of loot council? People still get rewarded for showing up and doing well (in a well run LC anyway, they will account for such things) but nobody has to worry about spending and saving any currency, because they get the gear for free. Further more, the leaders get to decide so you end up making sure people get gear that's an upgrade if they've put in the work, whether they like it or not. It's best for the raid and guild for these people to get upgrades, and when Mageblades and Staves of Dominance drop, you can give it to these people as well without DKP issues.
---
he deleted his account lol
---
You could always remove yourself from this subreddit. Everyone profits!
---
11 levels to go but I will check it out in a few weeks, thanks!
---
The community wasn't the same. Community at large is largely follow the twitch streamers. It's not a community I'd have fun in for long term.
---
This is what happens when people watch streamers like Tribe or Monkeynews and think what they do must be the best choice always. They just fucked up in char selection screen thats all.
---
Yeah we got that, you didn't have to say anything
---
I found dw while leveling didn't allow me to take on more than 1 mob at a time depending on the mob/area.
---
I got my ww axe, and respec'd to arms at \~45 (I could not give up that 5% crit). Leveled much faster since I frequently went ham on 3+mobs at a time with Sweeping Strikes --&gt; WW, with Cleave and MS followup. Taking 1-2 mobs during CD times. 
---
That all said, I am also a Tauren. So increased health pool and built-in aoe stun did help a ton!
---
Assuming you're a one-shot group, you can run a warrior (preferably Fury/Prot) in and have them burn Recklessness going into Phase 3 and dump everything they have into generating threat through damage (since the MT or another warrior tank should be applying Sunder Armor).
---
Alternatively, 1-2 of your Fury warriors can run with a beefier set and swap to a shield for Phase 3. Usually one of our warlocks is killed, followed by 2-3 mages before our Fury warriors start getting it.
---
The only real detriment to a DPS warrior slapping on a shield and tanking is the Flame Breath. Even with a few leather/mail pieces, her melee/cleave isn't fatal, but she'll hit them pretty hard. It's only when you eat melee (crit/crush) + Flame Breath that you're prone to dying. (Last Onyxia, she hit me for 11-1300 base, but breathed on me for 3700; tanking in full DPS gear which includes 2 mail, 2 leather, and 3 pieces that don't have stamina; also did not have a paladin in my group for Fire Resistance Aura.)
---
That's actually pretty amazing tradeoff, probably BIS for PvP.
---
You can sheep + insta break it to stop a healing touch 1v1 too so no not necessarily.
---
Loot council is hypothetically the perfect loot system, I just have been in guilds with them and there was always drama. Just personal experience though. I’m sure there’s guilds that do it fairly
---
&gt;"But I've invested so much time into this character!!1!" So what? That's sunk cost fallacy.
---
I don't entirely agree. There are scenarios where sunk cost fallacy is applicable but I'm not sure this is one. This has been more of a bait and switch. People invested a significant amount of time in the leveling process in an environment that was completely different. World pvp was happening at a level most consider to be fun but when the honor system came out people started grinding on players in a way that is frankly insane. It's not a matter of not wanting to start over simply because they've already invested time. It's a matter of already being at the finish line and then someone moving the goalposts. Rerolling isn't a palatable option for a lot of people. They'll just quit. They put in time, got to the end, and then the bottom fell out from under them. The entire environment of the game changed and now their investment is worth less. It's not simply that they've invested the time. It's that they invested the time and then the game changed completely. The game they wanted to play isn't there anymore. This is the problem with incentivizing pvp. It never needed to be incentivized like this. The naturally occurring world pvp that existed before honor was completely different. Players have been incentivized into toxic behavior by a bad system that requires toxic behavior to advance. Toxic behavior that didn't exist on any comparable scale while people were initially investing their time. This makes it more attractive to just quit than to start over. They can't play the characters they've grown to enjoy because the game was changed.
---
Yeah, you are a scummy scum boy
---
He's one of the people trying to constantly pick people off at the IF AH and bridge. Easy honor  I don't mind him
---
Im not toxic, grow up.
---
Did the fucking mod shills delete this thread?
---
What does hating women have to do with any of this?
---
You said earlier you are clicking on mobs, you can press tab as well to switch targets quickly. Corruption, tab corruption, tab corruption and then start spamming SB
---
Definitely read golden twat 😂
---
Could not dismiss until “totemic recall” was introduced.
---
you must have mana pots and runes. a huge portion of your healing comes from it. classic is more preparation than anything. if you're trying to make the cut in your raid for a spot don't be the unprepared person. Id rather keep a person who can farm 50g a raid then a someone with more gear.
---
Why would you even put this in writing. Delete.
---
If the eye or target dummy work, they are instant.
---
People REALLY undervalue the power of the paladin. I have played private servers for years also played on the private server that was very well known where the top vanilla pvpers hung out and every alliance premade that was well coordinated, was alliance and dumpstered horde premades. A healer that can literally go IMMUNE for 10 seconds, and make another healer immune to physical damage for 10 seconds is insane.
---
Paladin buffs are VERY impactful, and are not bound by a radius. (Such as totems you have to keep moving them.)
---
The racial system is fine, there's quite a few racials on alliance which are incredibly strong in PvP (dwarf, gnome and to a lesser extent human for stealth detect and night elf shadowmeld).
---
You sound like my sort of player. We think much alike.
---
Alliance had a strong week of PvP on Skeram this past week, I can respect it.
---
I feel like that would make more sense following the leaf statement.
---
Whatever it takes brother, no judgement, just victory. \*salute\*
---
The tablet you read in ZF (Tablet of Theka) talks about Mueh'zala who it describes as the 'God of Death, Father of Sleep, Son of Time, the Night's Friend'.  If I remember right from the Shadowlands info that will be a main character/boss of the expansion.
---
Love u
---
Yeah. There is no problem at all with a hunter using leather agi. There isn’t a ton of good mail agi. Rogues just need to learn to share :)
---
lol stop being offended on the behalf of others. besides its nothing to be offended about. perhaps you need to grow some thicker skin if this is offensive to you. freaking hell
---
How would the alt get into the same instance as your main?
---
Tab will switch between, in lower level dungeons just put up a curse of agony and corruption on each mob through tab targeting and shadow bolt/wand/drain life depending on situation and spec. I was usually top DPS or close to doing that while leveling dungeons. If the pack is real big I'd just throw dots on afew then rain of fire. Are you using life tap or are you going oom and missing out on dps there?
---
Leveled as both, can confirm fury dual wield is perfectly good and also very fun
---
Optimal path. Straight as the -crow- gryphon flies.
---
Axe of deep woods and flurry. Death bringer if it drops and bone slicing if you off hand with elemental sharpening stone
---
Yes they do you beyond fragile cunt
---
I was in Badlands last night farming consumables and there was a ton of small thorium.
---
It actually is. While Blizz seem happy to ignore collusion across faction lines, wintrading is explicitly banned.
---
Everyone knows those who camp boats can't actually PVP. Sure they can farm honor but that's the only way they can get honor. Both sides really shouldn't be bitching lol
---
Well done to you sir, regarding your usage of periods and other punctuation. I’ve read this response twice and have no clue what you’re trying to say?
---
It does
---
And imagine your disappointment when you realize they don't give DHKs despite being labeled Civilian, and your guild farmed those eyes for nothing.
---
&gt;166 healing is way too low to see efficiency from downranking,
---
I had 170 shadow power at low level 40's. him having 166 HEALING is woefully inadequate.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about.  I don't know any wow streamers, I don't care to know any wow streamers, and I don't have any problems with my servers community.  But.... if you rolled on Herod for example then I'm sure the community there is trash.  Quiting because the people on one server are streamerphiles is, imo, a pretty stupid reason.  There are plenty of servers that are amazing and have great communities... but it isn't clear why you don't go seek them out.
---
Ya idk if it took me 3 months to get to the 50s and I hit this phase and it bothered me id just wait for the bg patch and test the waters then, 1 week vs another 3 months at best just sounds terrible.
---
You have no actual argument then I see.
---
He’s taking the shortest route
---
with 305 skill it is 6%, i dont know the exact amount but i would imagine 5% at the most
---
I know it's hard to understand, but I'd rather see that fixed than FP farming and I'm Alliance on a slightly imbalanced server.
---
If you are an imbalanced server most people are probably waiting for bgs to release to stop the griefing
---
Gz!
---
That's the only notifier that' you'll be able to get too through our kit, great point. (In a vanilla setup)
---
Ahhh
---
WRT to your edit, I vote on the side of it being a guild concentrating on fast, efficient clears on current content and actively working/planning for building to  take on future content where difficulty level goes up quite a bit.  Perhaps not necessarily hardcore where they expect everyone to flask every raid, but intend to continue clearing future content.  Should be 10/10 1/1 after forming a halfway decent raid group, have decent leaders, more focused than a "casual" guild, but not a speedrun/flask guild.
---
First locks tank a twin then a dragon, what’s next
---
In Vanilla/TBC PvE and PvP servers were in the same battlegroups. It wasn’t segregated.
---
You are raid ready when you get attuned. Gear just makes it easier on healers
---
When you get geared the bigger the 1h damage the better.  Rage becomes a non issue when your hit and crit is good.
---
I was not looking for frozen wrath but shadow, some people would list pieces for 100g plus others would list it for 5-20g. I just ran searches for 'shadow' on the AH while still leveling and picked it up when cheap as some people likely don't realize the level 50+ stuff can be really good if you are unlucky on dungeon drops/don't have time to repeatedly farm some slots.
---
I'm beggin' ya to have sex.
---
So you all are advocating for no rules at all?  Like rooftop camping is allowed?  Or does this just apply when it benefits you?
---
It's his $15/month and he'll do whatever he feels like with it. Imagine telling someone you've never met before how to enjoy their spare time lmfao.
---
Let me be the 5th reply and break the tie. It most definitely refers to hardcore guilds that want to progress through content as early and quickly as possible. Just because they hit farm status faster than non-progression guilds doesn't mean they stop being progression guilds lol. It's speaking about the guild's mindset towards the game rather than their current status of any single given raid tier.
---
Yeah, anyone who doesn’t agree with you is illogical. Get DHK’d scrub. B/^)
---
But corrupted blood is a debuff no? Might only be player casted debuffs that dont tick down, but pls report this shit, I want it fixed
---
Came here for a Buckaroo Bonzai reference, was not disappointed.
---
Avoiding the guards via roof top is not the same as making the horde kill a civ.
---
Sounds more like a people problem than system problem to me.
---
Great now that songs stuck in my head
---
How do you 1v1 a guild running into MC?
---
I've seen a few other people disagreeing on this, I would guess that there was a hotfix pretty soon after this hit reddit causing people to get different answers depending on when they tested.
---
Mate, not using the full extent of your kits potential is your own call.. it's one item slot, and if you're only healing you shouldn't have inventory issues. It's not hard at all to pick up a random Rattlegore Buckler or what have you. You're severely limiting yourself as a paladin.
---
Someone posted a screenshot comparison a few days back, search this sub with "dishonorable" or something
---
Tbh you should gear warriors one by one instead of round robining the pieces. They scale sooo hard with gear, we have a warrior doing 600 DPS on Golemagg
---
I remember one time I took a flight path in Spires of Arak and it took me through an inn. My cousin and I were cracking up.
---

---
oh if they could they 100% would
---
but they cant
---
Blizzard programmed guards to not aggro if you are on a rooftop.  Blizzard programmed using duels to remove dishonorable debuff.  You are arguing those should be allowed without punishment too?
---
Oh cool he had TM dig
---
Nice summary. I wonder how many retcons it will survive.
---
Argument? No one here is arguing. You used yourself as an example but refuse to back it up. You’re making up examples to back up your “argument”. 
---
But you want to argue about a video game. Yikes.
---
This is a real beauty!  
---
I was considering writing an add-on to implement some achievements, and this gives some real inspiration! A fun thing would be a way to add in some crowd-sourced achievements/quests.
---
You compete with your own faction, dying is completely meaningless as long as you are getting kills
---
Standard Horde move. Savages.
---
&gt;I really wonder if horde players feel any satisfaction when they kill a 54 level not even genuinely pvp geared 
---
Not as much satisfaction from seeing threads like this.
---
Does anyone know if Blizzard is thinking about bringing paid server transfers? I have a character i want to play but on a different server.
---
Literally the race I tro when you make a new undead says they will always put themselves and their queen first, regardless of anything. Not in those words but definitely the gist of it.
---
You need at least 21 to get to Divine Favor which is what makes Pallies so mana efficient. Going a full 30 for extra 5% holy crit is a good idea due to that talent as well, and you'd only skip if you really wanted a hybrid build instead of specializing. But once you're 30 points in, you might as well take Holy Shock since it's just 1 more point and has great uses as well. Nobody takes less than 21 if they intend to heal at all.
---
Seems like A LOT of work to say, Fear+DoT+Shadow Bolt....
---
Yea I'm in a guild with lootcouncil, not sure if that is good or bad anymore, either way I can't get loot if it doesn't even drop xd
---
so if 2 raids are set to go against eachother one is heading into mc for the week and the opposing faction is set to try and disrupt this. they have their sappers set and ready. just as the mc groups rounds the corner they all pop out and begin to sapper down a bunch of honor kills, but hold up the team has a bunch of eye balls out to give dishonor now what do they do? how is that their fault they cant aoe now? no more sappers or weeks of honor gone?
---
Can't wait for this sub to realize they are getting trolled.
---
I wouldn't bother with what's best right now, because basically you will have to re-evaluate it all once you're more geared. 
---
In addition, MC is currently so easy, that if you follow best practice healing tips, chances are you won't even show up on healing metres. Fights are so short that people are spamming fast inefficient heals. 
---
So focus on on getting gear, reading the priest healing guides so you're ready for when you have gear, and getting experience from MC. Both experience with how to manage your mana on the few "longer" fights (Garr if including ads, Rag, and trash without breaks) - but also experience with how much it takes to actually be present on healing metres, to get an understanding of how the other healers in your raid are playing. 
---
Then once BWL lands, and some fights are hopefully a bit longer, you can learn how to do it right (hopefully) 
---
I fairly recently dinged 60 - and was shocked to see how little you actually get to heal if you heal right, basically you just end up cancelling every heal because everyone is just playing whack-a-mole with their fastest heal.
---
what the fuck you talking about? lel
---
Maybe they just understand what the word irony means.
---
Lmao!
---
&gt;How is Civilian the MOST anti-PvP tag in the game?
---
I said how. It actively punishes PvPing against things tagged with it. That's worse than not allowing PvP against it.
---
If something is player controlled, but doesn't allow PLAYER vs PLAYER combat, that rather defeats the purpose of PvP, no? Should Eye of Killrog be a Civilian too?
---
While I dont disagree, one could argue that exploring the world is fairly boring when it consists of lopsided encounters and occasionally being camped until you log
---
It's loot council but yeah its hard to get mageblade if you have 2nd bis. It went to warlock but mages should be interested as 7 mageblades won't drop fast. Hell our 1st run we got it so we are lucky
---
Less than 1% of the community plays with streamers. What a strange excuse to make up.
---
Snapshotting is the technical aspect of an Aura Effect on the player or one cast by the player, keeping the spell coefficient data at the time of the cast.  
---
In this case, the weapon effect has an indefinite duration, and is only applied when the weapon is put on.  
---
This type of scaling is only common on weapon effects, and is often considered an oversight.  
---
For example: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=21596/vitality  
---
Common to a few trinkets, does not scale with a coefficient, and thus cannot be snapshot.
---
Don't forget Earthslag Shoulders off Roccor.
---
Oh really? I like how you completely made that up because you did not say that in your original post at all.
---
I was hoping to hit r7 this morning, looking at my Honor last night assumed I had enough and I log out for the night. Log back in this morning with 30k less because blizzard was doing something and had incorrect data displayed. 95% through r6
---
RIFT, damn.. someone even remembers that? :D
---
I love the feeling of DWing but the results are just so comparatively bad that I can't justify it.  Against high level mobs a lot of my hits are glancing so I *really* need all the DMG I can't get from Mortal Strike/Overpower/Whirlwind and losing the instant DMG from a slow 2Her just hurts too much
---
???
---
“The fact people can exploit the system is on the fault on the people and not the system”
---
Are you ok?
---
[Oh, so like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh09uIN6tl0)
---
For higher-end PVP ranks, a few DKs can invalidate hours of work farming for HKs, and because most HK farming is done with *groups*, it dramatically increases the risk of getting a DK because if one person touches the civilian dummy, yeti, or Eye, it's a DK for the entire group.
---
Now couple that with the fact that the worst of the HK farming is being done on servers with really bad population imbalances where one faction has enjoyed superiority over questing areas (particularly Gadgetzan, Everlook, and Thorium Point), where the HK farmers are desperate for any and all HKs because of just how much competition there is from their own side in order to rank up.
---
That's an interesting idea never heard of it but kind of like it. 
---
Eh it's just a 1 roll on an item (unless everyone in your class wins something then it resets) up until Domo then it resets for everyone. 
---
BoEs are their own rolls and don't count towards the original roll. 
---
Obviously as time goes on it should get easier to get gear since other people already have the items. Especially for underplayed classes. But being warrior/rogue/mage takes longer since there's more of us. But we have also had rogue/warrior loot least drop so makes it tough. A ton of hunter/druid/priest loot &amp; pally tier pieces so those classes pretty decked out. Plus a lot of warlock set pieces. A lot of mage gear but there's a lot of mages so some of them don't have much loot while others have a lot kinda like rogues. 
---
I'll win stuff eventually but as an example before last night 2 weeks in a row we had Tier 1 rogue chest piece drop. And both times the top roll was like a 30.... lol. And somehow I couldn't beat it haha... I keep rolling like 10 or less on it. Sad times :(
---
It's a real Jacob's Ladder situation
---
The biggest surprise here is someone actually WANTS to go to BRD and isn’t stuck in a perpetual farm loop. 
---
**Been to BRD almost 200 times for Sav Gladiator Chest
---
&gt;The community wasn't the same.
---
Sounds to me like **you're** not the same.
---
Shut the fuck up Donny.
---
except pvp to pve xfers aren't a thing.
---
people love to assume though.
---
Ok I see...
---
Thanks. Do you, or anyone, know if that’s the max zoom setting on the leatrix addon? I have it turned up all the way on leatrix, but some people’s view distance just looks bigger to me. Does that command conflict with leatrix?
---
Yeah but alliance at various points control either brm, wpl, epl, kargath etc
---
And during those times (when several raids of alliance are camping) you take about 3 deaths to get into your instance
---
In 1v1 maybe yeah but in premades pvp alliance is much more dominant
---
Get satisfied while you can, soon there won't be any alliance for you to kill. Most of them will quit the game and the others will queue fast BGs while you guys are waiting idle at flight points, hoping to get in a BG while in queue. These are your golden days.
---
lol he can talk about the game and his experience with it without needing to verify his server/character. chill out
---
Yes, absolutely.  Having one avenue of recourse against griefers is perhaps the best thing that has ever happened in this game.
---
Idk I’m starting to think games like classic maybe remain relics of the past for a reason. The culture of gaming today is just way too different to let it be anything like it was in the past as far as size and player base.  But in all honesty and I guess to contribute to your discussion instead of troll as much I don’t think battlegrouos will make ques much longer, they had them before in vanilla and the whole point of it was to shorten the ques. Because before they were only server based. and ques were like 5-10 minutes for most players. Maybe 15-20 for AV even on the lower populated faction. Classic servers are way more larger and densely populated than they were in vanilla.
---
The moment you change factions is the moment you realize both sides are the same and full of assholes
---
The complaint becomes valid when you factor in the value of Instant Attacks with slow 2Hers vs a 1Her
---
and suspensions
---
I get that sometimes you have to corpse walk to get to dungeons. But 55mins. Cmon.... there's more than one way to get there. And if you run in with your group and actually use your abilities it won't take near as long.
---
It’s the old server population numbers from Wowhead. Some other sites show similar numbers. Not sure how accurate they really are.
---
ikr? i spent all the time i wasn't playing back in the day reading about the game and its "mysteries" lol
---
That expression has nothing to do with military situations, you should absolutely kill scouts given the opportunity.....
---
You mean someone who got griefed might be angry and wants to do it back, now who could have seen it coming.
---
Piqued*
---
I just gave up on it tbh.
---
I ran it with some buddies, a hunter and rogue couple I met.
---
I had no idea the chain was mail so when we got there I was like, "neat if it drops it's all mine."
---
My fourth run.
---
It fucking drops.
---
I'm on snapchat flexing to my warrior friend who ran it like, 30+ times? I look at my bags when the roll is done and..it's not in my bags..this has to be a bug or something right? Nope. Hunter won it. What the fuck? I look at the gear again and realize it's mail..and also hunter BiS (great itemization Blizzard).
---
"Wow, I can't believe I got this on my first run too!"
---
had to just log out after that.
---
Will always upvote stories from my fellow Devilsaur hunters. 
---
I once saw a level 53 NE Hunter go after an Ironhide. I was so proud of his #huntard instincts, but I still let him die so I could get the skin. 
---
This is the Way. The crater is not for the faint of heart.
---
What? He literally used himself as an example. It wouldn’t be hard to prove it. The fact you allow someone to make things up without providing proof is kinda sad. 
---
I didn’t ask him to verify his server and character. I just want to proof that he has raided 10 weeks without getting a single item. Which he can’t do. So why go back and forth on an example he made up in his head?
---
Did you mean the floor is really low, what you're saying implies it's easy to play yet hard to master.
---
High floor for skill means it's easy to get into and get results.
---
That actually never crossed my mind but it would probably be doable. But I'll leave that idea to you. I have some single-player ideas left if this needs an upgrade :)
---
That only works if your offtank can tank 8 adds at once, for a lot of newer guilds that's not the case.
---
Also, why?  That strat is so awkward.
---
One of the main reasons people don't raid as arms is that Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot, which a lot of raid/guild leaders wouldn't be ok with.
---
But with this system the player is able to choose if they want to go for the more contested item or to go for a less needed uncontested item. Also since all players are choosing what they are going for it doesn't allow for Loot Council drama.
---
it's not blizzard anymore it's activision
---
Why was the post deleted?
---
The gryphon, having seen the Mandalorian, an intellectual: "This is the way."
---
This forum is like 90% alliance shitters.  If they were any good at pvp they would be playing the game instead of lurking on forums to make the same trite comments on every post.
---
This the way to Narnia?
---
&gt; If the warrior can't tank that surely means squishier classes can't tank.
---
That's assuming the Warrior knows what he's doing. Sometimes they just don't.
---
I can tank a few things, no problemo, if they aren't of the heavy hitting variety (speaking in instance terms). As long as the DPS is DPSing.
---
I was just about to haha, but props to the guy for not spelling it peaked to begin with
---
Can't imagine Naxx will require as many consumables as on private servers where the bosses were tuned harder. I know plenty of people who raided Naxx in vanilla and got quite far into it (though didn't clear it), and while they say it was the first raid where they really had to farm for consumables, it wasn't even close to the kind of hardcore consumable stacking hardcore private server guilds seem to be doing.
---
Thing is... back then most people (even raiders) sucked, had only a fraction of the knowledge we now have, had to progress with presumably more bugs, didn't know the mechanics and strategies beforehand, were dealing with low resolutions and lag, had inferior addons, and the list of disadvantages compared to us now goes on and on.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but everything in the game so far has been extremely trivial compared to what I remember from vanilla, and even if AQ&gt;Naxx is many times harder I can't imagine it's nearly like what private server players are suggesting.
---
Today, on prime time (like 20-21 PM) i calculated how long it took, and it took literally 55 minutes. Some say "just go from Burning Steppes" but when you fly there you will get instakilled by 2 shadow priests and 3 warlocks camping the spot, and you walk like 3 minutes to spawn, and die again. After you are kinda far from the flight master, you can start riding to BRM. But if any wandering 60 horde sees you, you are insta dead. So it's not worth taking the risk eventually, just corpserunning from SG to BRD is more safe way of doing it.
---
I really miss the unit collision that Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning had. A handful of Black Orcs can hold the line in a doorway with good healer backup while the waves crash on their shields.
---
Lightning Reflexes PVP (0/21/30)
---
The Lightning Reflexes Build is great for PVP. It gets Aimed Shot, Lethal Shots, Mortal Shots and Scatter Shot from Marksmanship while still being able to reach Lightning Reflexes on the Survival Tree.
---
It's not unintended gameplay mechanics.  It's not exploitative.
---
Not one person has introduced a single screenshot depicting that this actually works.
---
Yet you see the entirety of the population on unbalanced servers come out of the woodwork sperging out about how it ruins the game and it's an exploit, and salt and salt and more salt.
---
It could be an elaborate ruse for all we know, just to demonstrate just how big a fucking baby all y'all are.
---
"We can't camp chokepoints anymore and free-farm anyone stupid enough to go through it because of EYE."
---
You want to war like that, with a big fucking AOE fuckfest in chokepoints where people can't get shit done?  Great.  You're acting like you're at war.
---
Well, you want to be at war, rules go out the window.  You want to indiscriminately bomb, you're going to cause civilian casualties.
---
Sounds like you want to not be at war anymore.
---
No problem.  Drop raid and go WPvP somewhere else.  You'll probably never see a yeti, or eye or any other thing that someone is clever enough to come up with.
---
But if you want to indiscriminately bomb the fuck out of one area, you don't get to bitch that YOU killed a civilian.  That's on you.
---
What was it that was said when it was demonstrated how much of a shitshow WPVP was on some servers?
---
Oh yeah...  "Adapt and overcome"
---
Sounds like they did.
---
Savage
---
Has a shorter cooldown when talented.
---
I would at the very least get to level 10, since the bear quest is located around Auberdine. 1-10 on a druid is a bit of a slog, but leveling really opens up once you get bear form.
---
After that you'll have the moonglade teleport, which you'll use to do your aquatic form quest since its located there.
---
There aren't any quests for cat/travel form, so you can feel free to level where ever you would like!
---
&gt;Get satisfied while you can, soon there won't be any alliance for you to kill.
---
I'm not Horde, I play Alliance.
---
&gt;Most of them will quit the game and the others will queue fast BGs in safe Ironforge while you guys are waiting idle at flight points, hoping to get in a BG while in queue.
---
Nice prediction. Let me guess, WoW Classic is going to be dead a month from now?
---
&gt;These are your golden days.
---
lol irony was used correctly here. Horde has been abusing the systems in place for honor grinds and saying "lol pvp on a pvp server get good" for weeks now. Their worry and anger about the same possibly happening to them is ironic.
---
I guess now we know where to find Mount 9 3/4.
---
Exactly what I'm saying.  We all know server based BGs and not as good as battle group BGs with respect to wait times.  And I'm going one step further to say region based BGs would be better than battle groups (again, this is proven theory, operations 101, just ready about queuing theory).
---
I dont trust Blizz's ability to balance battle groups in the slightest.  They've messed up nearly everything they had to make a decision about.
---
I can see on battle group having 15min queues, and another having 1min queues.
---
Just combine all battlegroups and you will 100% optimize the waiting times for both factions across all servers.  Its a no brainer.
---
I dunno, it's really easy. Everyone just burns the boss. Just how we've always done it.
---
What does FAP stand for? I am not googling "fap" at work!
---
This takes more skill than ganking a lower level. Release honor early without BGs... great job patching that hole in sales from HK. Idiots.
---
r/softwaregore
---
I think there is a lot of potential still in Azeroth, and still areas that were never developed.
---
For instance, you have this huge ass city/gate or some shit in Winterspring near the frostgiant, there is this naga place with sea giants in Azshara.
---
Then you have scrapped content like the dragon isles, or they could make a Scarlet monastery area/raid.
---
I think TBC will just limit classic, and add tons of conveniences back into the game. Like if you play TBC nwo and compare to classic, its completly different. Long travel times are not a thing, summoning stones means you get summoned everywhere. Flying is ruinous, and just outside of doing dungeons/raids the world is just way smaller.
---
Staying on Azeroth would be ideal, because its the only version of the game that is so drastically different from retail, and the only version that really nails MMORPG.
---
I disagree with the level difference thing, a well played character 10 levels below can still absolutely be a threat, and blizzard clearly cant handle 'he attacked first' as demonstrated by all kinds of actions in gadget.
---

You’re a hypocrite yourself if you used any of those things and are now crying for an immediate hotfix.

It took you out the other side of the mountain, then right back in so it could leave again.

That's what killed me laughing
---
Well, I was able to do well on the dispel parses, so I got that going for me.  I have incoming heal addons this time around and will see if that can make a difference.  I want to see if I can push myself to focus on finding the guys who aren't getting heals or have gotten one shot in the past.
---
I'm not big into the way classic community runs. I don't care about min/maxing or any of that. But at the same time I still want to do dungeon groups that isn't SMGY.
---
Ah, for some reason I had a brain fart and thought you mean the legionaire's sword, which has slightly higher top end damage than the battle boner for Hemo at 39.
---

---
You should change the u to an a.
---
Sir, with all due respect please calm down. You're getting overly worked up and being irrational.
---
You may think it's horrible design, it is enjoyable for others. You are not the authority on game design.
---
Blizzard explicitly did not leave a path to the rooftops, it's faulty geometry resulting from a primitive collision map generationn algorithm that allows you to get on rooftops. They have come out and said so themselves, they have not said anything on making certain NPCs civilians.
---
You do wish to be sheltered from your mistakes - AoEing in those instances was a mistake because you were punished by the eye. You could have prevented this by being smarter with your AoE. You wish for Blizzard to protect you which honestly is disappointing. Adapt your playstyle and you won't have a problem.

Hi, I'm yulath of &lt;Yang Gang&gt; and I just wanted to hop on to say all of this is true except that our core is actually only 15 members so the funnel is a little bit smaller, one time we even did 4 onyxias in one reset
---
Just as a note 9% hit is a hard cap when not dual wielding, ie. 2Hs, 1h/shield, and ranged.
---
As soon as you equip an offhand weapon, you gain 25% hit debuff for your autoattacks. You can technically be Rogue and not equip an OH and you wouldnt suffer the penalty.
---
Mentality they had spread. The dungeon spam groups came from them. Because none of them knew how to quest.
---
Sure... though I am not sure how we will decide who won. Lotus price?  
---
But most people don't respec even close to 2x per week.  As I recall, I would get 40g from just clearing BWL from the gold that the bosses drop. Never mind all the vendored loot.   
---
When we have ZG, AQ, BWL, MC all being cleared, thats alot of gold flowing in.
---
Maybe it’s time to get a real life job?
---
Often associated with this type of trauma is a need to distract, deflect, and blame others. After the gnome molested you, when did you first start having this hatred toward other gamers? When did your douche manners start to manifest?
---
Also, do you get the correlation between people not playing anymore, the resulting loss in revenue for Blizzard, and the existence of this game?
---
The purple people eater is coming to kill all yall m*f*ckas!
---
&gt; this game will suffer a HUGE drop in subs if they don't open transfers from PvP to PvE.
---
Yeah, because ruining the servers further by having everyone transfering off is a good solution.
---
If im going in from the front door, I usually go left for my jump. Not all the way left, but right of where the imp is chillin'.
---
If you jump from there, aim for a bush that is just to the right of a tree. Kind of hard to explain, wish I could give ya a screenshot.
---
There's nothing stopping you but you. Doesn't matter, I'm just sayin'.
---
Do you use a working version of the Felwood Timers addon? I can only find outdated versions.
---
Wrong-o! It’s a widely available item and working as intended! Server imbalance has to be dealt with. Ally is getting screwed by horde population, this just evens the playing field. Bans will only occur IF blizzard decides it’s a game breaking mechanic AND refuses to edit the code so those items don’t act like low level players.
---
Otherwise, suck it and pick your fights very carefully...
---
Some guilds die out, or merge, it happens. Just join a new guild.
---
Where can I read this?
---
Yep cats are probably best with prowl.  
---
Ive been using a wolf and it works (he has dash).  
---
Just wanna max out their health, and then get shadow res or fire res, or both.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I kind of gave up on it. One cannot use the active of the pouch at 19 and I do not see the benefit from just the stamina vs int or agility as well as both axe and staff hit quite harder
---
Or. And bear with me here. You could wait 8 more days and see if this shit is fixed with BGs. Don't know why everyone is bitching right now when we will have huge groups of previous honour farmers living inside BG's shortly...
---
I think that is the ZF hammer, which was made into a really strong blue item in later expansions.  For Classic/vanilla its just a white hammer afaik.
---
*insert generic comment saying you shouldnt have rolled pvp then noob haha* classic community was put out to be one of the best and its probs one of the worst. Just everyone at each others throat. Kinda sad. People put there feelings out about the balance of horde/ally and the usual response is 'blah blah pvp blah blah' no ones complaining about world pvp, the complaints are about the faction balance which is effecting world pvp. The unbalanced factions will kill the game. Then the community (horde players) wont have anyone to bitch at for putting forward there views on a game they are paying for and having a bad experience with.
---
Why dont you re roll??? Probs cause weve wasted enough time getting to this point we dont want to have to go through all the same stuff again and some people dont have the time to do it all again.
---
I didnt even make it to 60 man. Got to 55 and spent most of my time being hard farmed and camped. Wouldnt mind as much if there was allys running around to counter it but there isnt. Just gangs and gangs of horde. Shazz is dead no point continuing.
---
I wish you good luck for the future friend.
---
Broooo this made my day. Thank you
---
Also, if you don’t want DHKs you should have rolled a PVE server, sorry.
---
Windseeker is fantastic if you want a chance at pvp on a normal server.  I believe its the most balanced pve server with a slight tilt towards alliance.  It's nice enough that regular wpvp occurs all evening but you get to choose if/when you join in.
---
Yeah, i killed the ally escort quest in rfk when helping a buddy out, it said civ but no dhk
---
Yeah, wasn't aware of it because I usually only post my videos on r/hiddenwow (Which I moderate) but my last video and then this one were relevant to classic so I tried to post them here too. 
---
I got permission to post the images though so no big deal.
---
I'm not sure how that's true if ranking is relative to your own faction

---
someone did the math and it's within 2% of each other, 2H and 2W.
---
I feel better rage generation for the use of abilities while dual wielding; most warriors run at less than 10 rage and rely on a couple white hits to get their rage up.  Most abilities cost around 10-20 rage to use.  Smaller white hits keep rage up in that zone a lot better than heavy 2 Handers, IMO.
---
he called you old, the shade tho.....
---
Maybe it's Time to let people enjoy Stuff?
---
I never specced Fury until Classic, was always 2H Arms as I played on PvP servers back in the day. Leveled/dungeon tanked until 55 when I switched over to Fury, but retained my 2H weapon because I didn't want to farm for two weapons to maintain the same level of damage as my 2H.
---
Honestly, 2H Fury is awesome for dungeon DPSing too even for Alliance, and easily outshines 2H arms DPS. Arms always seemed like it hit harder to me because of Sweeping Strikes/Whirlwind or Cleave at the beginning of fights, coupled with the higher damage of Mortal Strike compared to Bloodthirst. But once you start entering dungeons where mob packs don't die within a few seconds, Fury's higher sustained rage generation allows you to do much more AOE damage via Whirlwind, and Flurry also is hugely helpful when you need to throw on a shield and tank as well.
---
Yay!
---
I dont give a fuck about classic being alive or dead, but i'm sure my server will. The bigger guilds in the server are already started to transfer to an underpopulated server, thinking they can change the ratio at their favor, and the imbalance of our server get wider and wider every day.
---
Queue as a group, resummon dude to wPvP zone, profit. I don't think it'll be ALOT better then it is now. Unless you are on an Alliance dominated server they will have instant queues
---
Windfury isn't reliable. Also is very easily destroyed. Which is why there really aren't too many Enh Shaman in pvp compared to classic. It's literally just Frost Shock and pray.
---
Do you believe that blizzard specifically put items like this in the game to create situations where civilians can be summoned at will to prevent the opposing faction from using AoE spells?
---
They're known from 14 years of client side data mining - so they aren't exact,  but they are well known and reliable.
---
On horde, you cannot be exalted with any city faction by 60 through doing quests.
---
You need to be at least 50's to start repeating the runecloth pass ins.
---
Pros and cons to both and hopefully this doesn't get too longwinded.
---
TBC AND BEYOND:
---
TBC had a lot going for it historically, the classes had more options and viability, there was greater depths to raids and quite a number of people never saw the tail end of it as well (talking about Sunwell here). As well the PvP players had arenas to really sink their teeth into which was incredible for so many reasons.
---
Drawback is of course, the introduction of Flying on the open world. It shrank the game world tremendously, but the map was fortunately designed for this. Love it or hate it, it was there and was really important.
---
PvE also got another huge buff, in heroic dungeons. No matter what tier you were raiding, most likely you were doing heroics at times for BoJ's (badges of justice), as typically new things came out with new raid tiers you wanted to access. This gave people a catch up mechanic, without making dungeons completely worthless. You could end up getting carried by people who actively raid Sunwell, while you are a fresh 70. I did this a lot, carrying people who were fresh 70 who we didn't know, as we could steamroll the content even carrying someone.
---
CLASSIC+:
---
There's a number of areas in the game which were developed, and never used.
---
For starters there's Caverns of Time, it is fully built, and yes you can get into it on classic. I have posted screenshots of me inside the caverns, and there are 3 dungeon portals inside which link to nothing. From TBC+ and beyond, one was Black Morass, one was Escape from Durnhold, and the final was turned into a raid portal for hyjal. But in the classic version of the game, the third portal where Hyjal would eventually be, doesn't resemble the later version of the tunnel, and the portal is silver, not green.
---
The Karazan catacombs is another, you can get into it by some means I will not get into as it would break the subreddit's rules but it's quite easy. The catacombs is fully explorable and is creepy as hell at places. It's very cramped and seems to be a dungerous location. Would have been something to be explored. Seems to be linked to a raid that was planned but scrapped as it wasn't working out well, I could see this brought back as a potential dungeon or small raid.
---
Hyjal is the third location which is fully built and explorable that I know about, and the terrain is very different from TBC hyjal (and eventually Cataclysm). The zone is .... massive. Takes about 20 minutes to fully traverse the zone on a mount, without stopping. There are multiple raid portals throughout the zone (green coloured) which again link to nothing. Most notably, there's a skull like rock formation which holds a raid portal (again links to nothing) which makes us believe it would have been linked to a dragon encounter. Such as with the only portal, it is in a dragon like rock formation. If you are bored, I HIGHLY recommend running around Hyjal, it's a well designed zone with varying landscapes.
---
My vote, once naxx is fully cleared, few months after they should put in a mini-tier, basically an in between Classic and TBC, and just have some small changes. Some things would include the zones I listed above being completed, as well QOL changes to the classes. Ideas for these QOL changes are such as:
---
Paladins would get a new Libram from the new zones (vendor or mob drop) which would give judgements a taunt mechanic. As well incoming healing would give the paladin x% of the amount healed in mana. The latter is taken from later expansions to compensate for paladin's mana difficulties in long duration fights, and the former is to provide a bit more tank ability.
---
Druids would have a new relic which would give them a form of block, again taking from future expansions. As well, frenzied regeneration would provide 40% damage reduction while it lasts.
---
Warriors would have a shield that would allow the warrior to use execute while in defensive stance. One of the drawbacks of execute is you need to be in berserker or battle stance. As well this shield makes all of your blocks deal % of your current hp back to your attacker.
---
Ele/enh shamans same kind of deal, relic to count as all of their totems (free up 4 bag spaces), as well as improve their specs to the point they are playable.
---
Boomkin/ferals get a relic same kind of deal.
---
Mostly, I want to see the zones. What kinds of stories could be built out of these zones and what was supposed to be.
---
While I am excited (playing druid and being mainspec FERAL for my guild) the QOL of TBC are MASSIVE and makes me much more viable than ever. (Though I could go moonchicken again)
---
Anyone who says 'Paladin &gt; Shaman' is a moron.  Full Stop.
---
Shamans literally hard counter paladins in pvp.  
---
Pretty hard to continue past that, even though your points are technically sound.
---
PvP'ing on a PvP server isn't any kind of exploit.  Exploits are things like rooftop camping and MC duels.
---
How is it ironic?  Irony implies the intended meaning is different but it's not.  It's not ironic that bad players will stoop to any level to get even.
---
The same thing does happen to the other faction.  Unless you are on a server like Skeram with a 9:1 faction balance you experience this on both sides.  Do you think horde on a 6:4 server can just waltz into BRM on a raid night unmolested because they have the faction advantage?  That's incredibly naive.
---
I'm regenning 5hps and there's nothing you can do about it!
---
Have you ever raided undercity?
---
Pfft, real warriors level as Prot.
---
guards dont do enough damage.
---
Well you dont have one, because the civilian doesn't give a dhk, just tested it.
---
It's great to see people doing something instead of just complaining on reddit.
---
I doubt they are anywhere near that price if your server is that dead lol. On mine there are at least 2-3 people checking every spawn all the time. IF you encounter one there will be another player fishing with you most of the time.
---
The only time it was worth fishing was first month. Now it's just way faster to simply farm the gold.
---
For 19 caster twinks, why isn't Staff of the Friar more popular?  I got it the other day from BFD and I thought I stumbled into a goldmine but after skimming a couple BIS 19 Mage guides I was surprised to see other options that seem like sidegrade or worse.
---
Yeah it's unfortunate that so much of its stats are dumped into Spirit but it still has a nice chunk of Int/Stamina and Spirit still seems useful
---
go ahead, it doesnt work
---
If you want to find op in game, his name is BobbyTables
---
&gt; But if you want to indiscriminately bomb the fuck out of one area, you don't get to bitch that YOU killed a civilian.  
---
This is why it's exploitative, I don't get how you're so blind to see it?  
---
NPC civilians in this game have fixed positions (barring patroling ones) and can be avoided when in towns.  
---
A player spawning in a civilian is not intended gameplay, but blizzard when they made the game 15 years ago didn't think too much about it when they added the eye or yeti. But now it's surfaced as a griefing mechanic, and should be dealt with as if it was a exploit.
---
They're the best at making me one shot you.
---
Thunderbluff is a dungeon you can never leave.
---
Ah, wow classic. Where wow boomers get to have reunions and us new players just listen and listen and listen to their stories. What a time to be alive.
---
Mate, it’s about efficiency and this is efficient you’re so offended that someone replied to your post and didn’t agree with you? Piss off kid
---
Most people (me included) chose PvP while expecting it to be something different than what it currently is. We were wrong, and we are suffering for it. Most people are hopefully waiting for things to calm down, like waiting for BG's for example, but when they see it didn't change anything, they will lose whatever hope they had and eventually stop playing the game. So it's either no sub money for Blizzard, or let them transfer. I think they will go with the latter.
---
&gt; How much honor do i give anyway?
---
Depends on number of players who are in the party that kills you, along with how many times they have killed you that day. After 4 deaths you are worth 0 to them.
---
Pre raid and raid gear means best in slot before you can raid and after you can raid, for instance Azuresong mageblade is bis for warlocks and because you get it out of a raid you call it raiding gear, its not called raiding gear because it is good for raiding.
---
A rideable Princess from Mara. Same size.
---
I replaced second wind with my DM trink, and used Reed with it. I was resto druid though so iunno if it's good for priests but second wind was trash.
---
Thanks, that was one of the questions I was gonna ask someone whether berserker or not, but I just LOVE overpower :P will stay in zerker then
---
Tell your guildie to get their auto attack timers level!!
---
Otherwise really nice use of the full kit. Engineering plus druid is kind of ridiculous.
---
I think tab will help, thanks. I definitely use life tap a lot.
---
I quit but still follow the drama
---
Shoutout to the Alliance in Felwood last night too. It seemed like every time I encountered a Horde player, there were 3 to 4 Alliance ready to pounce.
---
The entire line of reasoning for keeping factions in retail is fucking hilarious since mercenary queues exist. Faction literally can be made irrelevant in PvP.
---
Grats man!
---
He must have gotten a lot of hate or something. Jeez.
---
Hillschad
---
Why should they?  It's not a very good source of honor and not much different than arranging legitimate large scale pvp battles.
---
Why aren’t you a writer at Blizzard?
---
Also your gear need work. Get in those dungeons. But really you just need to look up the priority system fury warrioes use and memorize that.
---
And other people have tested it and say it does give one.  :)
---
But the mounts are meaningless
---
If you mean that tunnel with the spiders yeah. Went there today, allys miners came and went. But tbh the mobs are quite hard to kill. I am lvl 53 but even if i was 55 I would have struggled. These tiny spiders they shoot at you hit hard. 
---
Gonna try Fellwood tomorrow and that satryr place that was mentioned. Wish me luck!
---
It is whatever imho. Maybe get mindap talisman for the longer bwl fights or 20man only spits.
---
I think you mean the UBRS driver.  Ftfy
---
This used to happen to me all the time in WOD
---
Good call
---
Maybe you can recreate the slayer skill from RuneScape with an addon. Would be nice
---
Please make a post here about it or post a reply to your first comment with the outrage. i need it. please i beg you
---
Looking at recent comments, a lot of people have said this doesn't actually give you DHKs. So OP could've been making all of this up and probably deleted it to stop more negative attention.
---
Just tons of changes from items, to classes, to phasing into each zone, to population, to phase releases, to spawn rates, to addons... but nochanges I thought...
---
Nice, seems alliance griffins now use Quantum Tunneling to shorten fly trips.
---
Good thing I haven't, now what?
---
Single target like basically every other non-mage class has to.
---
Overpower damage with a 1hander is bad. Not worth losing rage to a stance dance.
---
The tier sets are dogshit for walock, but they might be decent in PvP due to high stam.
---
You can also speck like soul-link to just basically become a tank.
---
Thanks.  It's the npc xp that I was most curious about.
---
Treating DK feeding and rooftop camping the same is a slippery slope?
---
It certainly does look like it. They were brilliant and had the foresight to create such an amazing game with so many intricacies and clever little plays everywhere, like spell batching tricks (Gouging Blink etc). Maybe they saw AoE as overpowered and designed this as a counter to it. Makes a lot of sense.
---
at level 12 you might be able to just heal RFC or something until like 16 then you could heal WC. was fast for me i’m not sure how your experience would be. currently have a 19 shaman and want to get it up another level or two for SFK healing
---
Can confirm, allies on Bigglesworth are savage despite being outnumbered. It's almost as if the Horde are becoming complacent and lazy and the ubderdogs and grinding up to overthrow them. Am a Horde on Biggles and I respect you, Alliance. Except for the Gnomes.
---
Rideable prisoner from stockades
---
if you're alliance, there are 2 1h swords you can get from dungeon quests around lvl 40 that are really good.  I had a really good time as a dw warrior using those from 40-50 back in the day.
---
I mean, oh well, that's how they're allowed to play on a pvp server. The rest of us on *all* the other servers should be "punished" as well? It's more than Herod and the few other servers out there.
---
no one's going to choose a faction based on highly debated pvp racial benefits.
---
what the fuck are you talking about dumbass. i was never offended :S i merely thought you were being stupid and misunderstanding the point. ofc boosting is efficient.
---
Alright, will not raid this week cuz exams :( but next one!!
---
Related to this; can anyone *specifically* confirm or refute that this occurs with the target dummies? Because if so, that's a **huge** change to the meta, moreso than the Yetis (which can only be used in the correct towns).

DHK is for punishing people for killing something they shouldn't be killing. When the Eye is a Civilian, then that means you aren't supposed to kill it.

You do realize what game this is right?

Irl perhaps but should not be in a game people pay money for. It's trash behaviour. Period

Wow I didn't know they could go off rails like that. I always assumed the Gryphon ride was just an elaborate animation and not something that could lose pathing or interact with the environment.
---

---
Rasta Imposta! PST to Tinklesticks, Sheeta, Orz, or Groovin. Tell them Delacourt sent you!
---
Most likely because you're  part of the problem. Zerging lower lvls and feeling great about it. Gg
---
It looked wrong as I wrote it, despite tonight's wine amounts. Thanks, edited!
---
Yeah 2 classes can't use 2 of their biggest spells in 1v1 because griefers, makes sense
---
If you go imp slam, it’s a 1sec cast. Spinal reaper is 3.4 sec swing speed iirc. With flurry activated, you’ll be swinging the reaper every ~2.4 seconds. You should have plenty of time between auto attacks to get in a slam, and rotate bloodthirst as well as whirlwind. 
---
There is another school of thought on the subject that involves spamming hamstring between auto attacks to fish for wind fury procs, instead of using slam as the rage dump.
---
A whole raid, even! You go into ZG on behalf of the zandalari
---
Auto downvote bots. There all over the subreddit.
---
amenew  ewww
---
Lmao, DHKs are a part of PVP. Complicated, I know.
---
As if getting camped or being griefed matters on what faction you play. I'm a 55 tauren druid on a very horde heavy PvP server and spend more than half my time in game corpse walking. I'm sure alliance has it a bit worse on the same server, but it doesn't mean horde are immune to getting corpse camped and griefed. Regardless of faction, if you're under 60 and/or alone, you're going to have a bad time. (Unless you enjoy spending a few hours just to do one quest in Winterspring).
---
That's literally exactly what I said, just different wording. It is against the rules but not well enforced.
---
The eyes don't give DHKs good luck speds
---
&gt; Ally is getting screwed by horde population, this just evens the playing field   
---
Spoken like a true loser.  You know what would ACTUALLY even the playing field?  Evening the playing field and appealing to blizz to fix the servers instead of punihsing inoncent player's honor reps because you are butthurt.
---
Ahh yes. The road less traveled
---
Great question. Maybe a scarab or raptor from ZF. definitely some kind of devilsaur from wc
---
Puking words into a keyboard while going on a rant isn't high effort, even if you write 8 paragraphs on why pvp is bad.
---
Yeah, it kinda sucks as it discourages travelling with a shield equipped at any time, because if you DO get engaged on by a rogue you'll want those sweet reckoning stacks to strike them back right after a stun wears off.
---
It's far easier to survive a rogue stunlock with a shield on of course, but devo aura functions as a third of a shield armour value so it does the trick for me.
---
Oh btw reckoning stacks do last through death (though some say this is a bug), so you can assasinate someone easily if they're low health near your body with 5 big swings. (Just remember to apply SoR right before, it's the only damaging seal that applies its buff to all the swings (SoC can only be applied to one of them))
---
There’s BiS lists for pve since every raid encounter looks the same week after week.
---
Pvp is very situational. So you can’t really make a BiS list. On broad terms you want to stack more stam and have engineering.
---
I disagree. I think Thrall did what any reasonable leader would do. Also, I don’t think Sylvanas knew about the Wrathgate plan, she wasn’t corrupted then.
---
have you not been innervating people?
---
This still happens in retail, specially in draenor.
---
Yeah never do the south entrance route...it just isn't worth it, so I've found out lately.
---
When you get up on the south ramp into BRM when you die to the horde gank squad that is every 10 feet, you have to run all the way from fucking Thorium Point graveyard, through BRM, to the south ramp to rez.
---
It's so fucking stupid.
---
All horde are scum.
---
Wait are you bitching that a Hunter rolled on a mail item?
---
So many buthurt alliance in here.  hahaha
---
Everything in WoW is meaningless.
---
I have an exam in 15m. Don’t know what it’s on, but fuck it. At least I gained 1 level on my now 58 on my alt.
---
They intentionally programmed yetis to give DKs?
---
Should had done everything there is to do in BRD before p2.
---
You're comparing warriors cleave ability to single target raid dps. Sweeping strikes/whirlwind is great in dungeons. Not so great on a single target fight that lasts several minutes.
---
Or idk do a quest without questie?
---
We have 4 raid teams was hoping we could move around between them easily but turns out it's not so much the case. They all use their own loot systems so hard to jump from one to the other. But I like my raid team and it's a good time for me so not much I can do. I also don't really know what loot I would prefer over it so I guess it is what it is.
---
Until the rogue gets 8/9 t3, but then the game is already over so fresh when?
---
Prioritys!
---
with the faith in his hands &lt;3
---
This is why horde is the better faction
---
People were expecting Blizz to follow up classic with TBC, so they decided to roll horde to save themselves a reroll/faction transfer down the road.
---
Well of course, but meaningless shit you earn feels better than meaningless shit you paid for. Imo atleast
---
Are you retarded? They said it's working as intended, which unless someone has video of this in Classic or they have a blue post stating intent, isn't meeting the burden of proof.
---
you act as if that is the only type of person that goes into or around BRM. what if an respected horde guild is going into MC with their pvp escort raid and this alliance DK-ball of QQ and hate runs into them? thats kinda fucked up isn't it?
---
&gt;I hate people pretty much equally. 
---
The feeling is probably mutual. Happens to people who react so poorly to being molested by gnomes. 
---
&gt;Glad all the casuals are quitting to be honest.
---
So you don't get the correlation between the player base size, revenue, and Blizzard keeping the game going. Gotcha. Man, that gnome really messed you up. 
---
Honestly I feel sorry for you. It must suck to be so angry and bitter towards a video game. Think about it, you actually want people to STOP playing.....wow.
---
I was like trying to picture riding a basilisk lol
---
Most common faction and most common race selection for that class. Bold choice.
---
Pretty sure anyone with a brain just scans then throws everything on there at a slight undercut. I don't think anyone pays attention to the "market price" unless it's for something that's easily price fixed due to low quantities.
---
classic warlock discord has a pvp google sheets list w/ ranked items.
---
1 rogue, 1 feral druid (flag carrier), 1 resto shaman, 1 warrior, 2 disc/holy priest, 2 mages, 1 warlock, 1 hunter.
---
Rogue defends the FR while hunter and warlock scout outside, shaman literally pockets the warrior the whole time.
---
Once both teams have the flag you create an offensive and defensive group... usually offense is 1 priest, shaman, warrior, rogue, warlock. Defense is priest, 2 mages, hunter, druid.
---
That's just a rough sketch of how it would ideally work out. Obviously things can be shifted or you could have another warrior and no warlock or w/e. 
---
Alliance just replace the shaman for paladin.
---
Early server transfer were a mistake, and made the faction imbalances even worse.
---
Faction transfers (yes, I know about paladins and shamans) is a better solution since it actually helps alleviate the issue.
---
This and shadow bolt and fear and death coil into soul fire bye bye gnome eat poop reroll horde but wait dont ur picked gnome u dont worth the pride
---
This. Sorry, you can't run your awesome pvp spec in raids.
---
I figured they stayed up for a little while because I am constantly finding plants that have already been salved but are still lootable.
---
"Oh, here we go again." was my thought when it decided to go back in.
---
My wife taught me this.  We're duo-leveling and she's been running sword and board the whole time.  I tried to get her to swap to 2H but she just swapped back after 10 minutes saying she didn't like it.  XD

&gt;&gt; Ally is getting screwed by horde population, this just evens the playing field

---
Sounds like pvp is happening on a pvp server. If they don't like it they should go reroll on PVE.
---
Nothing I said is an opinion. It's a fact that I'm frustrated by the boat campers. It's my opinion that boat campers have other serious issues going on in their personal lives. But me being getting tired of it isn't an opinion. You're the 2nd horde in the last hour responding tome that's having trouble with simple definitions... weird.
---
I wish they would just do away with auction add-ons altogether. Stop fucking up the economy.
---
Lol why would they add mount drops to every dungeon? I played classic because it’s not like retail. I’m not saying don’t add anything else but adding something like that doesn’t fit with the classic feel.
---
What a persuasive argument, I'm convinced.
---
&gt; Also is very easily destroyed
---
Rank 1 is only 115 mana and it stays on for 9 sec after you cast it.
---
It's *never*. Unless you have another hunter giving you trueshot aura, which won't happen in later raids where you have very little hunters in your raid comp.
---
Join the world channel mate normally /4  or /world I think
---
As someone who plays on Kirtonos, I still have zero fucking clue why they let Horde transfer here as it was already imbalanced and already high pop. I also saw first hand the effect as we lost heaps of players on the Ally side. 
---
I like Faction changes too. I am only Alliance right now as my friends rolled alliance so I did too to play with them. Turns out that meant them stopping at level 30ish.
---
Run dungeons or find an out of the way spot to grind. What class are you?
---
Yeah op, why don't you organise a 80 man gank squad so you can quest?
---
Why do you want all these? Just to sell head enchants?
---
Gold auction loot is better than both of those.
---
Would they help explain why treating exploitative behavior the same is a slippery slope?
---

Killing an enemy scout is not the same as "shooting the messenger."    
---
An enemy scout is serving the enemy by giving away information about your location/movements/fortifications etc and is therefore worthwhile for you to dispose of so that information does not get back to the enemy for them to use against you.
---
A messenger, in the context of the phrase, is someone who is not responsible for the information being relayed to you, and so does not deserve to be harmed for delivering it.  As an example, your friend tells you he saw your girl macking on another guy.  This information may get you angry and you might start yelling at your friend.  But you have no reason to get mad at your friend.  He didn't do anything, he's just informing you.  "Don't shoot the messenger."
---
Yeah man sorry i'll change my entire sleep schedule to do BRD from now on my bad
---
if anything this shows how these people complaining about other are the biggest dipshits themselves. 
---
its just sad at this point.
---
I clearly wasted time typing this out because I said almost the exact same thing. lol
---
It's a huge complaint because of the lack of top end damage from the slow weapons. Huge overpower crits (50% chance in arms) mortal strikes, and whirlwinds absolutely destroy. This isnt even taking into consideration the axe spec, deep wounds, and impale that all come from the arms tree. 
---
Dw fury is great (I am fury right now for raids) once you get hit gear but not until that point. It might feel like a miss at 3.8 seconds is pretty brutal but over time it is just way more damage over all.
---
Is this the same VC on Frostmane which made us Horde run in terror?
---
haha that gnome
---
You know, there's only one thing to do at a time like this:
---
Keep your feet on the ground.
---
Dog you aren’t understanding why Classic was released. Classic was released to emulate the vanilla experience. Some thing obviously have changed: server pop, game knowledge, meta, etc. but what you are asking to be done was unheard of in vanilla (faction and race changes). Enough things have changed, please just leave it at that and let the game do it’s best at what it’s supposed to be doing. This added element just doesn’t line up with Classic. I know you’re heart is in the right place but the last thing Classic needs is MORE changes my man
---
I must admit I don't know what the accepted procedure was here, though I suspect one of your own was sent to return any reply and the messenger was held till afterward.
---
[That said there was always this option, which probably was considered dishonorable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZeYVIWz99I)
---
When they made it a civilian yes.
---
Gotta say from my raid night experience on Herod, the horde really need those numbers to just hold the alliance for a few seconds.  
---
kinda reminds me of when I played Planetside 2, and you could tell when you had to actually worry about the enemy vs when it was just a zerg that you needed to out maneuver.
---
Checked out your logs too.
---
Your DPS rotation priorities should be:
---
BT&gt;WW&gt;HS
---
Using HS as rage dump when BT and WW are on CD.
---
If you’re DW’ing and think you can handle the micro then do HS queueing.
---
That should increase your DPS significantly to compete with rogues of equal gear.
---
You can stance dance for OP if you want. But only if these conditions are met:
---
1. BT on CD
---
2. WW on CD
---
3. Below 25 rage (to not lose rage while dancing)
---
Then OP isn’t the worst thing to do.
---
o its fine? o really? thanks! i had no idea i needed to come to reddit to discuss how in which the way i could PVP on a PVP server. 
---
jesus grow a pair
---
They were certainly ambitious, that's for sure. I suspect they had lateral expansion model planned from the outset but the businessmen changed it due to moneymaking pressures (hierarchical expansions facilitate better gear treadmills and frontloaded profits from expac purchases).
---
Drop rates are not client side at all.
---
It's my 3rd alt that i want to get to 60.
---
I didnt reroll, but I rolled on a pve server b/c the queue time was like 6 hours for everything else but this server on launch night. 
---
TBH, we attack eachother's cities and get HKs, we flag up and form raids and try to best one another  at TM/SS all day / night every day. There's been no shortage of pvp. Currently Rank 6, and I haven't done THAT much grinding for it yet.
---
Unless he is questing in BRM/SG which are is the most contested zone in the game right, he woudln't need that many people.
---
He could probably get enough by asking for a grp in general chat, or doing /who and whisper to do their fucking job.
---
closest thing i found is an addon called more stopwatches. lets you open multiple timers counting up or down at once. also useful for instance farming to keep track of reset timers.
---
There are times you can swap stance without losing rage though
---
Piggy back?
---
This was on Fairganks last night
---
Instance till 60. And farm your pre raid so you’re ready to go by 60

That's as good as it gets. Some people prefer [0/24/27](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZtVohthZciVRkhu) though.
---
Lightning Reflexes isn't worth it for PVP. You're better off with better talents.
---
Like runescape treasure trails!
---
Not sure I always avoided slam builds like the plague because the thought of having to spam a warrior ability with a cast time sounds like a nightmare.
---
exactly!
---
thats what i dont understand about this reddit.
---
almost every "problem" this sub has gets fixed by playing in a group.
---
They intentionally made yetis DKs?  They were like "people keep killing the yetis we have to do something?"
---
CFIT controlled flight into terrain
---
Yes, when they respawn in 25 minutes they do not need to be salved again (until they've been looted a certain number of times).
---
Except then you realize that they are doing this because its the only way to earn honor. But then if you want to rank hard u have to kill more, and other people kill more to get higher, so it just means they want to rank.
---
It's not like most people wouldn't want to just bg instead of running around the world searching for people to kill.
---
So much misinformation in this thread. If you prefer dw fury for leveling all the more power to you but please dont spread false ideas that it is somehow better than arms for leveling. It simply isnt true. If you dont care about min maxing that is totally fine but dont try to convince people it is better because it isnt.
---
closest thing i found is an addon called more stopwatches. lets you open multiple stopwatches that tick independently. also useful for instance farming to keep track of reset timers.
---
TCS and in phase 5 I think it’s the 25 ago enchant to 2H. 
---
I also have a 5 Stan 5 agi 2H axe I could use. Depending on wat the TCS might sell for after bgs

You can really tell how much you hate when someone answers you without being positive. You argue over your own ‘opinion’. And you assume I’m horde ? 🤣 you kinda of just prove my “no one like stupid opinions” by answering with one , you assume they have serious issues because they’re having fun in a way that upsets you is hilarious
---
Dont get me wrong, when I first played in 2005 I clicked everything. But seeing clicking now actually kind of hurts lol. I should go outside or something
---
Very simply put, there are issues with displayed honor, and that explains your before and after.
---
What is your problem/issue/question regarding the "different mage"?
---
the irony lol, you cry like a pve baby so you probably fit in well there
---
You seem to want Classic to be retail.
---
Just my opinion, but i dont think it will be beneficial / wise to go fury/prot for raid yet with your gear level. I switched over when I had all the hit / crit pieces and Perditions Blade + Core Hound Tooth, along with ony neck and 4-5 pieces of Might / wrath for tankiness.
---
1. The first screenshot was taken at about 8pm this Tuesday before the reset (Brisbane time), then other two were taken on Wednesday Morning.   I have almost 11k honor and continue to to gain above 30 honor kills.  After the reset I am missing over 3000 honor, 58 honor kills which I had prior to Tuesday and the honor kills from Tuesday evening, these arent included in 'This Week' totals.
---
2. My life time honor kills increased by 31 after the reset, which is the number of kills that I gained on Tuesday but is well under my 'This Week' number from the first screenshot.
---
3. My other mage has the exact same issue with lifetime honorable kills being incorrect and Last Week not counting Yesterdays values.
---
4. Not Circled but in the first screenshot I have a standing of 478 with 14 honorable kills, players with 10's of thousands of honor points for the week had a higher standing than me with my 14 kills.
---
&gt; An enemy scout is serving the enemy by giving away information about your location/movements/fortifications etc and is therefore worthwhile for you to dispose of so that information does not get back to the enemy for them to use against you.
---
Following this logic you should absolutely "dipose of" (murder) civilians who have observed your numbers / formation, because they could potentially relay that information to the enemy.
---
The eye is not responsible for what the enemies do with the information it obtains, it simply observes. Just like how guns don't kill people - people kill people. So don't blame the tool, and don't take away our guns. #2A #GunRights
---
*I want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride!*
---
those people are liars, it says civilian but doesnt do anything on your character sheet. Feel free to go farm them and use them to your hearts content though.
---
What’s this slam macro and is it better than WF fishing w/ hamstring?
---
Simultaneous actions, same as 2 rogues sapping each other, always been around.
---
Yes I remember that name very well!  Gotta say though, was not a fan of you, so you must've been a good player then :)
---
&gt;  the legend that destroyed weeks of honor farm for the horde. 
---
what do you mean? first i've heard this.
---
So you expected no pvp on a pvp realm or??? 
---
What did you actually expect. And un less you were dumb enough to roll on a streamer server, its not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.
---
8/8
---
Of all the pretenders, it came the closest and lasted the longest. It was active with a healthy population for a good 4-5 years.
---
Had this happen on launch day.
---
Nooooo it was deleted!!!
---
Enh Shamans don't need the totem themselves, and any shaman spec can cast it...
---
Anyone in uniform is an enemy soldier. Supply lines and scouts are fair game and always have been. Read the history of any war throughout history and you will find examples. Also, Non-uniformed scouts are called spies and shot as well.
---
I think EVERY dungeon is a bit too much, like you want stockades and RFC to drop mounts? C'mon.
---
Realistically it should be just 40+ dungeons, or even just the 60 since you probably want them to epic.
---
Oh man I love it. Anyone remember Unknown mage back in the day? 
---

55mins is average for me, which means some is more and some is less. It wouldnt be bad if it was just 1 area thats camped, its the entire route from TP to BRD entrance (always with like 20 horde right in front, no idea why). Morgan's Vigil is just as bad, and it continues all the way to BRD as well, which means redridge is not better.
---
Well in any case, spirit just isn't very useful. Every twink will have bandages for health regen, so spirit would only be useful for regenerating mana. As a priest/warlock/mage, 8 spirit will net you 5 mp5, and 8 intel will get you 120 mana. Your best case scenario breakeven point for spirit over intel is 120 seconds to regenerate the 120 mana. Take into account the Five Second Rule, and you'll probably need to be alive (and below full mana) for 10+ minutes at a time before spirit ends up being more valuable.
---
or buy potions
---
Players saying that something should be banned and crying about is essentially the same thing
---
My AH account has been logged on for 15 days so far.
---
Wrong again. I'm on a heavy pop horde server as alliance and don't Zerg anything. Being in a raid is bad honor per hour. Solo/5 man groups is the way to go.
---
says the dude crying on a forum.
---
This can be done easily with a weakaura (or plain ToT frame). However, **every** implementation, whether via libthreat or plain Jane ToT, will flicker when a mob targets someone else for a spell or mechanic, etc.
---
Back in the day, I always leveled 51-60 in AV.
---
Good xp and great rewards from the reputation.
---
LC is good if LC leaders are transparent and held accountable. 2 days before raid ours publishes a doc with who will get what loot if it drops, and they always are willing to explain the rationale
---
In my experience, 95% of the time people advertise groups that say "have summon", what they actually mean is "well we do have a warlock in the group so we could *plausibly* summon you, but three people will have to actually head over to the dungeon first and chances are they haven't even thought that far ahead yet".
---
1/1200 drop rate, good luck.
---
Are you having a stroke
---
No body is saying rogues are useless. There's just a much better option than having 2 rogues. They're useless in team fights which any premade vs premade would be.
---
I level with  a shield and let other classes do the damage
---
If you’re not having fun playing the game and you’re not willing to take measures to change that (roll PvE, group up), you absolutely should quit. I don’t think anyone would argue that
---
Horde: "Our nameplates will blot out the sun."
---
Alliance: "Then we will fight in the shade."
---
Horde: "Only if you consider being corpse camped 'fighting'"

*Awkward black kid gif*
---
It dropped three times out of a five time arena run for me the other night. Two warriors got them and i took the third because fuck it I guess i'm ret now.
---
how is this ganking lvl 20s LOL
---
From what I've read the past day, Ret pally with HoJ and macro is completely fucking broken. You can get multiple extra guaranteed attacks you're not meant to get.
---
What are you even talking about? The whole point of DW Fury tanking is the increased threat that comes *at the expense of mitigation*.  Where do you think that mitigation is coming from?
---
It might be “worth it” in some situations, but in both dw and 2h situations you are giving up a ton of *mitigation*, which is the only point the op was making.
---
All joking aside meme comps probably won't be bad unless you're running against a well organized premade.
---
just don't kill the eye looool
---
No there was an endless amount of complaints already about those so no need to add mine, but here it's all praise for the exploit so I guess I have to add some actual sanity into the discussion.
---
Seeing as it would take at least 600 hours(but most likely 1200 hours) to farm, this won't ever become the meta.
---
It's an mmo with open world pvp. How exactly do you expect to enforce even numbers in world pvp lmao.
---
would you mind to share the result please, thanks in advance.
---
Take the route form Dun Morogh, should be two routes one on the western side and one on the eastern side of the zone. Then follow the mountain route and just drop down pretty much on top of the BRM entrence. If done correctly it should shave off a good chunk of the time spent running. Bonus points to die in lava and be able to spawn closer to the BRD tunnels and save the gauntlet ganks.
---
You can’t use the full extent of your kits potential, ever, full stop.   Perhaps I am gimping myself in not wearing a shield, but The loss for redoubt is minimal.  Since I’m not specced into holy shield and BoSanc, a measly shield spike won’t do much to make redoubt overly useful, as the damage reduction is minimal per hit against any reasonable geared melee.
---
Its been pointed out that in beta, you only needed a mage and lock in the group. With that the rest of the group would never need to leave the zone of their choice. This is because you get ported back to where you were when you zoned into the BG. So a Kill squad mage will port out. Q up the group. Get summoned back and So on. Private Servers made the change to help this issue.
---
Doubtful; but whatever code is used to determine if an NPC is a civilian is flagging the yeti as one. You're assuming malice where this is none.
---
lol your comment history shows you're horde.
---
People were killing a lot of important NPCs. So they made important NPC's civilians to rectify the situation.
---
Why was this deleted...?
---
there are 3x as many horde on the server. It takes 2 hours to walk to an instance because you get killed 3 seconds after you revive. They work in 5-10 groups of 5-10 each. I've seen at the height about 200+  horde camping the entrance to Blackrock mountain, including the spirit healer.
---
If you land in thorium point, you're instantly killed. There's no fighting back, there's a ton of them and you die in less than 2 seconds. If you revive at the spirit healer, you're killed again, and now you're stuck permanently in that spot. you can only log out, there's no other way to move your character.
---
if you try to move towards the instance, there's wave after wave of horde, camping the entire length. dozens of alliance ghosts walking. As soon as you review, you're instantly stunned and killed. There is no escape. There's no way to fight back, there's either you keep reviving and dying for 2 more hours or you log out.
---
There's no quest, it's just that there's a massive faction imbalance. If there was a more equal number of players on each side, an equal number of people could potentially fight back and clear the way. However this is impossible
---
Just a typical orc
---
Ion is a complete moron so its not surprising his explanations sound like your average comment here.
---
You're not forced to get a dhk, just don't hit the eye lol
---
Just don't frostnova looool, just look for the small eye in a 40v40 pvp raid loooool  
---
10iq comment dawg
---
There were enough Shrek fans and emo kids to fill the ranks of Horde too.
---
Its absolutely as bad as claimed. Landing in LHC or BRD is a fucking gamble.
---
Talking to people like that is pretty snotty. I shouldn't have engaged you as long as I did.
---
He’s on a boat that low lvls frequently take. It doesn’t take a genius to see that. Are you brain dead????? LOL
---
Oh wow how convenient, let's just brand everyone we see a spy then and kill them. Civilians in the middle of the road? Potential spies, they could relay information such as your numbers / formations to the enemy.
---
No, fuck that. The eye is a neutral observer, it is a non-combatant. It is not its fault if the enemies use the information it scouts to their advantage, it just wants to live its life, and I for one am glad that Blizzard punish you war-hungry monsters for ending its life for your selfish purposes. #EndWar
---
Thanks. I'll have to take a closer look when I have time but my understanding was that tribute solo for druids was not possible on classic, unlike pservers.
---
The cons are detracting even further from something people waited 15 years for. You are adding an extra element to the game that wasn’t around back then and it would be adding even more changes then we already have. I could maybe see race changes but even that detracts from the RPG element of the game. Faction changes would be a terrible addition for PvP server and  for RPG reasons. 
---
What you are suggesting doing aren’t bad ideas if the point of classic wasn’t to try and emulate vanilla. To prove that point, they went ahead and progressed and did that in retail, but that is retail. Classic isn’t supposed to include those things, Classic is supposed to emulate the original WoW to the best of its ability, too many changes have happened as it is and adding this would just further derail the game from its intended design.
---
Trust me there are lots of things they could add to change the game and arguably make it “better” but this isn’t about being better it’s about re creating the vanilla experience in the best way they can
---
Do you think that this practice is going to become pervasive like instance camping is?  Some people are definitely going to do this, but I don't think you'll see 4 raids full of honor farmers just chilling in BRM like you do now.
---
Sword spec arms warriors are capable of incredible burst damage especially with WF.
---
guess it depends on what you mean by "a huge chuck". it's the biggest single item that gives mitigation, but it's not supremely important. ofc unless you need mitigation, but then you'd also switch out a lot of dps gear
---
This is just "what if every dungeon had mount, what mount would then drop from the dungeon"
---
Guy, we’re not even talking about tanking. We’re talking about whether redoubt or imp devo is more useless. 
---
I’m not specced to tank at all but end up tanking because there’s no tanks and I’m a paladin. 
---
If your play style dictates that you never have a shield on, don’t get redoubt. If at some point you may ever wear a shield, get redoubt.
---
I see the same thing, Horde-side on Herod. Tons of people flying on top of each other.
---
Yeah haha I guess this is just the truth. Been thinking about it quite a bit after this post. Missed the boat, eh
---
From Dire Maul, a large bear - like the [Armored Brown Bear](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Reins_of_the_Armored_Brown_Bear_(Horde))
---
From Razor Fen Downs and Razor Fen Crawl - huge rideable boars.
---
Wailing Caverns - dino mount - obviously, but in a crazy color scheme
---
&gt; How is it ironic? Irony implies the intended meaning is different but it's not. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony
---
&gt;The term irony has its roots in the Greek comic character Eiron, a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character Alazon. The Socratic irony of the Platonic dialogues derives from this comic origin. 
---
Cleverly using tricks to beat an arrogant opponent (with an unfair advantage) at his own game might be considered *Ur-Irony.*
---
This is how I did it in vanilla. I literally had a wallpaper (made in MS Paint) saying ”NO WOW UNTIL HOMEWORK IS DONE”. I aced everything, played a lot. Worked out well except the lack of sleep and the depression following that but hey what does not kill you makes you stronger...?
---
Impossible! Only Alliance die, according to this Sub.
---
So this is how they justify ruining their servers... 
---
Enjoy cycling yourself with no alliance around.
---
i mean i tried it in SM armory, and although i do actually get crit this way (as opposed to being too high level to be crit), i end up taking way more damage than i should for the amount of reckoning chargs im getting
---
and in pvp a good portion of the time i end up getting stunned, still spamming the macro and then sit and get murdered for no good reason. as far as i know, there's no way for a macro to check if i'm stunned
---
If you use the appraiser it automatically sets the price for you and default is market price. I think it's just and average over a period of time, but usually it's way off.
---
Very typical. Get called out on your logical errors -&gt; call the other person names, because you cannot argue using facts and logic. You should improve your argumentation style before you proceed to call people's playstyles "exploiting" using baseless arguments. Good day sir.
---
There's a max camera distance addon that I can't remember the name of. If you search camera in the twitch app you'll find it though.
---
Or you can create a macro that you hit on each login.
---
Yep and you die once or fight them off, go to your corpse and mount up and leave. I dont understand
---
Why everybody feels the need to respond to me like i'm the one camping cities? I know you are upset, but please learn to reason dispite being blinded by hatred.... and you know.... making stuff up. Cause the only dumbass is you blindly assuming stuff :D
---
found the butthurt hordekek
---
The only times I pay attention to market price if there are no other items like it for sale, then I use Auctioneer's 3x market price. Also when something is listed on the AH for less than or at market and I can't undercut without losing money. Those folks really need to get an AH addon.
---
Camping lowbies is fine too I guess but it means your life is really shitty if that's what you need to do to make yourself feel better. I feel like you probably have some issues you should seek therapy for if my comment triggered you so hard. I hope you get the help you need.
---
I'm a warrior.  Zero escapability.  /cry
---
Yep, and tanks were certainly using it into Mt Hyjal.
---
Thank you, Priest!
---
you are my hero, thank you
---
Pretty sure you’re getting the intent mixed up.  The way you mean it is when dipshits respond to people complaining about the server, usually because it’s a PvP server and they’re getting PvP’d on.
---
The person you responded to meant it in the sense that they think it’s just a bad server in general, and that the person they responded to should leave to save themselves from it.
---
Nah, they're super handy, even if it's just to speed things up.
---
Do you have Questie?
---
Seems the other post about the Yeti that caused this discovery has been deleted by the mods. Wouldn't be surprised to see this post disappear too.
---
Have you been paying attention at all? Lol
---
So this "clever trick" of force feeding DKs is ironic because it only aids alliance who are always excepted to lose?
---
And in WOW, the entire theme of the NE revolves around you trying to quell blights and corruptions of all kinds.  Even the starter area has a quest that basically says that you must "ensure that the balance of nature is maintained."
---
First of all, a 'top healing parse' is meaningless since you can't heal damage that isn't done. So you're probably talking about top *raid* parses.
---
But these parses are all of fights where the healing demands are completely trivialized by the speed of the fight. It's a hell of a lot easier to just tell your healers to spam heal like a Paladin than it is to work out complex healing coordination that you don't actually need.
---
Healers are fundamentally in the risk management business. But when there's no risk to manage, there's no job to do.
---
What you're arguing is a bit like saying pediatricians have fewer patients die of cancer than oncologists. While this is true, it doesn't mean you should ask a pediatrician how to deal with cancer.
---
Well, yeah. 
---
Sounds like dishonorable kills happened on a dishonorable kill server. Maybe you should have rolled a single target class instead?
---
imagine clicking
---
Will do!
---
No need to be a dickhead
---
Sg, burning steppes, winterspring, tanaris, wpl, epl and felwood are literally 7/24 camped by tbc geared hordes, there is absolutely no way you can form a pug group in world chat and beat them, you need a dedicated pvp group and even then your victory is only last 10 minutes because people you killed will call for help and they will get it.  People don't do their fucking job because there is no people, they are leaving the game or raidlogging, or just hardcore honor farmers who are going to stick to their best route and will not help you.
---
So just intentionally be obtuse so "win" an argument?
---
Look at all those people going to get camped in morgan's vigil.
---
Bonus armor, if you find yourself in bear form a lot, particularly gear slots that don't normally have it.  If you mostly function as a stealth healer, stam/int.  If you try to stay on targets until they die and often rely on other people healing you, aim more for STR/AGI.  20 agi = 1 crit.
---
How do you get from Dun Morogh to BRD? I've never heard about this
---
Yes, that's the max setting supported by the client and is the value set by Leatrix among many other addons :)
---
This is his code:
---
    -- Function to set camera zoom
---
    local function SetZoom()
---
        if LeaPlusLC["MaxCameraZoom"] == "On" then
---
            SetCVar("cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor", 4.0)
---
        else
---
            SetCVar("cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor", 1.9)
---
        end
---
    end
---
At 49 you should be farming mara for your princess ring and looking at hinterlands, especially for the elite quests.  At 50 start grinding ST
---
Glad you enjoyed it. My server is dying now.
---
I can't actually believe someone would let a rogue roll on a binding. Either super casual guild with no foresight at all or they just didn't know better.
---
Oh um... thank you Banana man.
---
It is because of spell batching in classic. Back in 2005 peoples ping was shit so when you do the instant powershift the game sees that the leader of the pack is already on you so it doesnt reapply it once you shift out. Use the macro posted in this thread and you will be good to go. I know it is supposed to be #nochanges but spell batching isnt needed anymore. It is why a heal can go off but you still die.
---
&gt; for the lulz
---
yeap you're a highly acoustic cringelord
---
Where did I imply malice?  I implied it was unintended because it almost certainly was.
---
Were you using addons for this?  I use Tuk UI and it adds a "Land at Nearest Flight Path" button which I clicked one time and it immediately turned the wyvern 90 degrees mid-flight and flew directly through mountains, walls, etc and took me DIRECTLY to Org.
---
k
---
T_T
---
I really don't think so. More people are going to attempt to "rank." I think more people are informed about the rank system and want to take advantage of it. I think there is a certail try-hard casual type of player that will always try and murder everyone they come across for honor for this reason. No one should try to quest right now. If you are mid fifties the BEST xp farm for you is Arena/Anger/Golem runs. Find a group that is after the trinkets and just chain run A/A/G in BRD for experience.
---
It's clever asymmetrical warfare, regardless of which faction employs it.
---
It causes lose to the expected winner.  That's ironic.
---
Alliance 40 |Horde 60 
---
Assuming 
---
1. Everyone on both factions are level 60
---
2. Both Factions equally queue for Battlegrounds by population
---
Simulation:
---
Battleground = N Minutes long
---
Round 1:
---
Horde groups 1 2 3 4
---
Alliance groups 1 2 3 4
---
Waiting N minutes is horde groups 5 6
---
Round 2
---
Horde group 5 6 1 2
---
Waiting N Minutes is horde groups 3 4
---
Results
---
Horde will on average wait 1/3 the N minutes BG time
---
Examples
---
If WSG last 30m horde will wait 10m on avg.
---
If AV lasts 3 hrs, Horde will wait 1hr on avg.
---
Notes
---
If we go by current world PVP participation on PVP servers, it seems more world PVPrs went horde by percent of total population.
---
I predict that this trend will continue into battlegroung participation, meaning wait times for horde will be greater than 1/3 BG average duration.
---
Well, you're right, but at the end of the day they're tough to beat like any geared healer. Geared HPals are far worse for all that matters. Also as you said the skill cap is very high, and any minor mistake can very fast be a death sentence. You're tough to beat, but you have to play flawlessly in long, exhausting attrition fights to beat your opponents too. I'm commenting just to give an other perspective for people reading this.
---
If a geared War/Rogue catches you out of bear form you're dead in 3 seconds on a burst, leather provides virtually 0 protection. If you're not outdoors and can't use travel form mages will eat you alive. Warlocks, Ele Shamans (burst) and Spriests (dispelling Rejuv/Regrowth+burst) are a no go either unless you use fancy tactics or win the attrition wars. The only thing that is quite "easily" killable with a geared &amp; skilled resto against ***good*** ***opponents*** are hunters and some meme specs. All of that was tested for a while on PServers. 
---
Druids are truly the most unrewarding class in Vanilla given the amount of skill they take to play competitively in PvP. BC on the other hand made them quite broken ... Sad for such a fantastic class.
---
That is an absolutely insane season pass and nothing at all like what we see here in the US :( I’m sorry you have to pay so much lol
---
Hopefully.  I'm anxiously looking forward to the tears of the Horde from losing every AV, and sitting in 20 minute bg que's for every minute I wasted getting corpse camped by a bunch of fucking mouthbreathers after an HK.
---
im still killing any horde lowbie i see, doesnt really matter
---
A story to remember forever friend, live on.
---
I mean i dont see why it would. The serious Honor farmers will want honor while waiting for Qs. Even if its a little. With only the mage needed to leave and the rest of the raid staying, then a simple summon back. Specially if the qs are longer.
---
Oooh thank you im in the discord but havent looked around it yet. Ill go look for it when im off work! Itd be sweet if they had gear for each level bracket with Bgs comin up
---
It’s self sustaining if you grind for gold in retail. Which I don’t, because the time that would take is worth a whole lot more to me than a couple subs
---
You don’t get exp from BGs but you will get exp from turning in 3 Marks of Honour. It is a repeatable quest outside the AV entrance. It gives about 6-8k exp. 
---
You get 3 marks for a win. 1 mark for a loss.
---
So yes, you can gain exp from AV.
---
Yeah cause 2 frustrated people crying on reddit is less worse than 1. Now both sides are fucked. Smh, some people have the reasoning of a 5 year old here.
---
I would enjoy a little throne on a platform being held up with 4 kobold slaves from RFC.
---
Thanks man this is good stuff. Good to know that I do most of these things already. 
---
I have on occasion been using downranked rejuv on tanks, since the max rank just uses so much mana. But wasn't sure if it was even worth it since the healing coefficients are so low. 
---
One interesting thing I've read that I wouldn't mind trying later is regrowth spec. Just using the downranked regrowth with the Regrowth talent (crit) and Nature's Grace which gives you the 0.5sec cast reduction on the next spell.
---
Weird, alliance cities are becoming empty on benediction and guilds are leaving due to the horde camping and excessive ganking. 
---
Judging from the self submitted pop data it looks like the server is becoming more and more unbalanced favoring horde.
---
They are worth a lot less on alliance but this is still low haha.  Good for him.
---
I love when people celebrate before actually winning the roll, like they assume it’s going straight to them. Like when the wand finally dropped at scholo and this priest was like “OMG FINALLY FUCK YES” and I win the roll. Then he just logs out in the dungeons. I don’t understand these people lol
---
Same shit as when a mob sees you and hits you but you still get a cheap shot off.
---
I really feel like it is a bug still, most references to HP stacking come from the earliest TBC where spell power/crit was reworked.
---
Even still, its so broken it should be patched.
---
Suwch fwuwwy
---
Wrote my initial comment before you added your edit, but I still disagree. In regards to race and faction changes, those aren’t “needs” those are wants. You want to have your cake and eat it too. You can very much create a new character of your newly desired race and faction, it is not a need. There are options already available.
---
Auctionator lists the "current price" as the most recently seen item when you scanned. It's really on you to keep it current.
---
I find it useful for identifying twink items I wouldn't recognize otherwise.
---
While I see your point, I'd say there's a difference between *very slowly* getting to content, and being completely unable to get to content. You can make your way, death by death, towards BRM. However, if someone is killing a quest NPC, people are completely unable to advance a quest.
---
LET THERE BE HAND OF JUSTICE FOR US ROGUES FFS
---
But it doesn't.  First off there is no expected winner.  If you think being on the more populous side makes your opponents fall down in defeat before you then you are mistaken.  Secondly, it doesn't cause them to "lose."  This doesn't let you wipe a pvp raid, it just feeds a DK.
---
Implying that you need to actually leave Ironforge to be slaughtered for hours.
---
Tourists were always going to leave. That's what makes them tourists.
---
Yes, it does pulse. Its about every 1 sec/1.5 sec. ive had mobs get stuck in entrapment for 10 seconds straight before
---
Probably meant 555g lol. Congrats.
---
But what social deformaties do you have?  Lol must be a pretty sad and pathetic person irl.
---
Two folks who chose the rogue class.
---
Ya
---
This. Even as Horde on Herod I get teabagged by at least 2 roaming groups of alliance. Now I fly into Burning Stepps instead. Less encounters on the way to BRM for sure..
---
dw will always be better on alliance, idk about horde
---
Ah I see you have aspergers
---
I have had more fun leveling on a pvp server over the last few weeks 
---
I highly recommend it, there is a real sense of danger, immersion, and people willing to team up 
---
Around level 35-40 the PCL really starts to pick up
---
do you have a nickname i can use ?
---
I assume you mean Curse of Exhaustion. 
---
It's pretty good but it takes some getting used to. You don't need more then 3/4 improved though. It's not about being a lot faster than your opponent but it's more about using it at those times where even a slight movement advantage will help you.
---
Do they accomplish their goal of farming honor?
---
No, just the opposite; by trying to farm honor, they lose honor?
---
That seems like a win for the "farmed," and a loss to the "farmer," to me.
---
We love you too
---
lol, i need to see this.
---
you can also use it to kite if you pop rocket boots/swiftness potion.
---
Eh, any shaman worth their salt won't be casting WF really. You're too busy purging, healing, interrupting, casting burst damage. And your air totem slot is best used on grounding totem.
---
I've never been given a single second not either trying to help with casts or defend myself with casts. Alliance players beeline for shamans because they're both healers and have the least self defense of any class in the game.
---
People sit there and kill you instantly when you Rez. Over and over and over. That’s how. There’s no escape in most cases especially if you are pre 60 with no epic mount
---
&gt; Yes, I know, it's proven. 2H will do beter dps.
---
I'm not so sure that's always the case. I was soloing some low green mobs using my rockpounder from ulda while farming ore and it just felt off, so I switched to my DW setup (phantom blade MH and sword of serenty offhand) and that seemed to work better. Being a tester by profession, I needed numbers. I reset my damage data and fought for a while using my 2 hander, reset the data, and then fought for a while with the DW setup. I was getting ~100 dps with the DW setup and ~85 dps with the 2 hander. There were almost no opportunities for overpower since there weren't many dodges, and I **assume** *some* of the hit penalty associated with DW was mitigated because my weapon skill was substantially higher than the mobs' defense skill. How well that translates to different mobs at different relative levels, I don't know, but in *this* scenario dual wielding provided substantially more damage output. I wonder if a substantial amount of damage testing being focused on raid type mobs might be giving a false impression of damage output in other situations.
---
How can you fight a caster mainly warlock and mage as a rogue?
---
As a warrior... be patient....Spawn- CHARGE, BLOODRAGE, FEAR =now= *RUUUUUUUN*
---
The blue post doesn’t explain the standing being out.
---
Right that's totally on point here and 100% relevant to classic, actually quite an eye opener and something nobody knew for the past 15 years.
---
Always sniping?
---
I have to disagree. 
---
I think would make more sense to see it as unintended emergent gameplay. Blizzard did not design spell batching so that people could execute the pvp combos we use today. Spell batching was initially put in due to latency limitations. It was included in classic as a way to keep classic mechanics similar to vanilla. Blizzard also didn't intend for skull of impending doom to be a 5head pvp item. They also didn't intend wolf's head helm to be feral dps bis for the entire game. 
---
These are all forms of emergent gameplay. The ball us in blizzard's court to determine which forms of emergent gameplay they want to keep. Wall jumping and safe-spotting are other example of emergent gameplay but they removed some of them and made others bannable offenses.
---
Why is that?
---
Holy, I was not aware 25agi was not out yet, only been preparing by twinks for different brackets. Don’t even have a 60. Thanks. On my Server prices for 19 and 29 are dropping like crazy. I sold a bunch a few weeks ago for a lot of gold, now most prices have completely dropped through a flood of items and undercutting
---
It's the claw breath combo landing together that is the real issue.
---
This is rich. Go roll on a PVE Server if you want to play an easy game mate.  "Cheating". No one is forcing you to camp BRM.
---
Correct, but the only data we have is farmed from client side observation
---
Wow, is that typical of you? When you can't rationally respond to people you call them intentionally obtuse?
---
The Civilian tag is used to mark NPCs that Blizzard wants to deter you from killing. Blizzard would not have marked these NPCs as civillians if they didn't intend to do so.
---
Quit whining and simply adapt your playstyle. Be smart with your AoE and this will never affect you. Blizzard can't protect you from every hazard in the game, that's for carebears.

My main is 48, I can't travel to anywhere relevant to level. I usually only have a couple of hours to play and when I'm spending the majority of that time corpse traveling and waiting on a max res timer it just isn't fun, it isn't engaging. Before Phase 2 I was free to level wherever I wanted. Did I get ganked a few times, sure of course it's a pvp server after all. But was a mercilessly farmed for honor from the moment I landed, no? Did it take 45 minutes to get into an instance portal? No. So what do I do? Die 5-6 times for every mob I kill for XP? Averaging under 10 mobs an hour accounting for travel/res wait time? that's absurd! Try to get into an instance, corpse hopping for 45 minutes only for the party to disband because the healer/tank gets too frustrated? That doesn't work very well either. 
---
/end rant
---
Maybe you are the bad one if they kill you that easily while still using all that stuff :')
---
What makes you think layering changed anything?
---
This doesn’t work
---
Or cry about it on reddit, that seems to be getting you far. Gimme dem downvotes.
---
Its obvious that people chose horde, but its far from obvious that it was *because* of racials. If that were true every class that could be orc would be orc; orc is the only racial that really is a cut above all the others. But you're still seeing plenty of these tauren warriors, troll hunters, ud warlocks, etc. Its a total package, the lore, the "faction fantasy," etc.
---
You might want to share your talent tree and gear with us in order to understand your downfall.
---
RFC could drop a cave worm.
---
Awww someone needs the last word! I love people like you, so easily triggered.
---
You have to look at where the zones are and where they lead to and for who. BRM is universally accessed by both factions and for players of all levels (from BRD  to MC gearing).
---
Menethil is ally only, so is Mojache for example.
---
EPL chapel is close to UC.
---
So the only locations that matter are BRM and DM. Both are usually under ally control.
---
Naturally, uncontested, easy access is going to be camped. But real commitment is to take the important spots for everyone - brm &amp; dm.
---
That assumes an awful lot. Alts, people just now joining, playtime; there's lots of reasons why you might still have shit to do in brd.
---
Doesn't help that Blizzard is having issues with the honor system being accurate.
---
R1 FoL and R4 FoL make up 50-60% of my FoL casts as a paladin, and I'm near the top of the meters. Using your downranked heals on geared tanks is more efficient than waiting for them to get chunked to use your max rank. 
---
This is the same for priests too.
---
Lmao, considering you're so fucking butthurt and your language it just means you're just an asshole like in the OP. Do us all a favor and quit the game, we'd be better off without you, just like everyone else in this world.
---
it's almost never worth stance dancing for overpower, just take 3/3 improved heroic strike instead of 1/2 improved overpower.
---
You guys are awful at running away properly
---
Good the only good horde is a dead one!
---
Wait, seriously?
---
This doesn't make sense, your memory is Playing tricks on you old timer.
---
Just switch to a PVE server. I did and I don't regret it. You'll still have BGs and there's kind of some wPVP that occurs, but you're not going to get shat on for just landing at a FP.
---
Or just save yourself 5g for a respec when you do get a shield.  I’m not gonna build my spec on a “what if”.  I suggested the talents that were always up.  devo aura, garbage, but there whenever.  Redoubt, garbage unless you’re tanking, and useless if you don’t have a shield.
---
You’re a big boy, surely you can switch out your talents without my permission.
---
I camped him for a few days. First time I saw him, I got about 5 sec into the tame and get ganked by alliance hunter. I run back to try again and see that she isn't even taming it just camping there. Then about 8 of his guildies show up in like 1 minute (no idea how they all got there so quick) and they let a 39 dwarf hunter tame it. I did my best to annoy them by scatter shot the dwarf and scare beast but once the res timer started I was fucked.
---
I ended up taming him 2 days later but that guild will forever be on my kos list.
---
The guards in freewind post in 1k needles are lvl 40 and don't do shit.
---
Both are solo specs. 
---
I thought I preferred SL/Shadowburn but SL/Nightfall is actually really fun. Plus, you can tank DM:East in it, even though it's a bit of a meme.
---
SL/Nightfall is good at one thing: Being a tanky motherfucker.
---
SL/Shadowburn: You've got a bit more direct damage but you die easier.
---
goodbye tourist
---
Pvp on a pvp server
---
Unfortunately, no good shammy hear drops for alliance in MC.  But 5 and 10 man's have it.
---
You've got it wrong, people are glad gank squads are getting fucked over. Its not about how many people are frustrated, its about been glad that the 60s roaming in squads ganking are been frustrated. 
---
It might be childish but fuckem
---
Félicitations !
---
“Bruh how is corpse camping real lmao just mount up lol haha just leave dude” 
---
Don’t bother talking to this guy, he has no idea what he’s talking about.
---
That button is by default in classic. I clicked the button after gryphon turned towards IF because I wanted to land on WPL.
---
Cringe
---
Grouping up isn't really a viable option, let's get a 40 man raid to be able to run brd - ofc that's going to work. Or let's get 15 people so we can clear epl or wpl fp to quest - cause that's not going to attract a few horde raids. Doing pvp isn't the problem on the extremely one sided servers, it's that we literally can't do anything but it. There is no other content available and it sucks massively.
---
I get the feeling that this is only the case if you have all of the other bis crit gear, surely 6% isn't optimal for prebis? I'm sitting at 10% hit chance and 20.8% crit right now with prebis minus ubrs shoulders/ubrs rin/brd chest, are you saying i should drop 4% hit and replace it with valor/other strength gear regardless of my other stats or?
---
If all of the "bis" lists i've seen are to be believed I would be sitting at around 12/13% hit with all of them. Are all of those lists just wrong? I'm genuinely curious because I see so many different conflicting opinions floating around.
---
Yeah I tried it today, got the same.
---
You make really good points, but I disagree with two points you made. First, you dont believe that BG's will fix the issue. I agree to some extent. It will help with the overall issue, but of course there will always still be world PvP. Its just undeniably fun to go kill an unexpecting person(im alliance and horde always do it to me, but its still fun to do every so often). The BG's will be more honor to gain, as well as the tokens you get for extra rep to get special rewards. The vast majority of people are world pvp'nig for the honor i believe. The other point I disagree with is that subs will drop specifically if they dont allow transfers to PvE servers. Most players(I would say all, but you clearly disagree, so "most" players) join PvP servers, knowing what they are getting into. Any pvp server will always have world pvp. People will stop subbing for a number of issues in the game, but not because they dont allow server changes.
---
WoW's basic AH is really pretty terrible. Comparing it to something like GW2's AH puts it to shame. In other games you can place buy orders that get filled. WoW only allows sell orders.
---
Did you know there's only 1 difference between PVP and PVE servers? That difference is that you can be attacked on PVP servers. So why play on the server that has the features you don't like?
---
I think I'm on one of the only servers where its alliance rolling around with deathballs ganking for honor..
---
&gt;When you just overwhelmingly crush the minority faction I don't see how you can't believe they won't try to find any means necessary to fight back.
---
There are people in this world that believe that the strong deserve to crush the weak.
---
They tend to overestimate their strength, and cry when they lose.
---
Ok so a group of 5 meets another group of 5 and they start fighting. A priest in the back pops this and runs it into the middle of the fight. You think it's fair the entire other groups gets an DHK?
---
Bruh... you know what a twink is, right...?
---
I want a Herod helicopter mount
---
Plz post a vid, lol.
---
Don’t do what shit
---
how do you play without stacking nameplates?
---
Yeah minmax + Twitchtards are to blame.
---
So quit. Not every game is for every person, clearly this one isn't for you.
---
At the same time, though, dungeon tanking is very efficient way to gold farm, pretty much guarantees you  a spot in any instance at any time, and is extremely fun. People get too caught up with raiding in this game, end game pre-bis dungeon tanking is a blast.
---
sometimes people who pick this up think its terrible because it has "no stats."
---
Yeah the TCS was selling for 80g on me server a couple weeks ago. It’s back to 30g.  
---
The rogue twins weapons are still 200g. Out of control. 
---
Very happy I picked a hunter, super easy to gear.
---
The Kill on site mentality will not stop. The amount of players roaming specifically to kill people will be drastically reduced though.
---
I’ve always got the world chat up. I’ve never found someone looking for a dungeon or respond to me that is near
---
No argument here, I was in the same boat at 60. One lucky BRD run got me four great pieces, so it can happen.
---
Says man who needs the last word :)
---
That's really nice. I scan everyday, sometimes multiple times. Auctioneer using some sort of average to find market price.
---
I can only speak from experience in classic and tbc 19s, but I never swapped weapons. I'm sure you can swap and be effective but you want the mana and as soon as you swap you lose the extra mana from the stacked intellect.
---
I got corpse camped in DM a few days back. A rogue just camped my corpse on each respawn. I couldn't run because I couldn't get away. I couldn't fight back because half hp respawns. 
---
I had to wait there dead until another solo person (the rogue never showed if it was a group) came along for the rogue to gank. When he initiated I spawned and got a fear off while the rogue was distracted and was able to kill. 
---
I guess I could have spirit rezzed but fuck my 15$ a month I'll go take a 10 minute break out of my hour a day gameplay time.
---
I believe you are exactly right. I have already started seeing some wPvP drop off week to week, and I can only attribute it to people realizing they don’t have the time to push higher ranks. Interested to see what happens next week.
---
Genuine question: it you canceled your sub and dont care about WoW again, why come back for this? I only solo kill pvp on my rogue so this doesnt effect me, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems weird on you to come back just to spite random people although you dont want to play the game? You ok up there?
---
I played on one of largest pop servers in vanilla and horde overwhelmed alliance. One nice change is the lack of constant complaining about how OP shamans were.
---
2h with windfury = super triple blood moon bonk
---
Aren't you ashamed to argue in such bad faith?
---
They hit for like &lt;50 dmg while you run around killing all the lvl 30s there.
---
I dunno. Honestly, leaving the paladin stranded in the middle of the ocean seems a lot more satisfying than killing them.
---
If you die repeatedly to reach content to the point your gear breaks (which isn't uncommon), you have to corpse run your way back to repair it and redo the process. You're effectively locked out of content
---
:)
---
And if it's not, why does it make my dick so hard?
---
Outland in Classic would be interesting. Originally they wanted to have Outland and Northrend in vanilla at launch. Every location from WC3 was supposed to be in. But they ran out of time
---
His first. The guild probably has it on farm if they can afford to bring a lvl 57.
---
It increased how many people were on the server at a given time
---
&gt; Or just quit, whatever
---
In 3 months, 
---
"This is so shit noob blizzard allowed faction imbalance and everyone quit"
---
Transfer to a pve u won’t regret it
---
nice, first you have to see them tough....
---
If you go SM/DS (shadow master+demonic sacrifice) you will have 0 points in destruction. 
---
What you're missing out on is Bane (16.67% more dps from shadowbolts) and Ruin which is worth more than either SM or DS alone.
---
If you only compare Bane to SM, you'll see that Bane is better than SM (10%), so DS/Ruin is the best DPS spec in terms of raw shadowbolt damage. 
---
However, Corruption scales really well with gear (because it has a 2 sec cast time before talents) so SM/Ruin can technically become better than DS/Ruin with enough spell power. That was a couple of weeks into AQ.
---
Can confirm, also on Sulfuras.  I'm level 55, and I see alliance deathballs anywhere I'm questing.  Thankfully, being a rogue helps a little bit.
---
Oh, I’m not butt hurt but it’s really funny when players find a way to screw the other faction up and then the cries start to be heard on both sides. Lol.
---
I can't wait to have insta BG popping, being in the unbalanced side has to have it's perks.
---
Oh thanks, didn't feel like sleeping tonight anyway
---
I believe it is unreasonable to put wall jumping and safespotting in the same boat as all of the other things you mentioned, including this. Yes, they're all technically aspects of the game that Blizzard did not strictly intend, but wall jumping and safespotting are literally errors in the product of an algorithm - it all goes away when Blizzard uses a more precise collision map generation algorithm, which is what they did. You can define them as exploits precisely because the guards cannot reach those spots, despite the clear intent being for them to be able to do so.
---
All the other things you mentioned - call it emergent gameplay or whatever - have largely served to improve the game, though they're technically not the explicit intent. This could be a clever way to deter mass AoE in PvP, for instance. I don't see any problems with it staying, and calling it an exploit is disingenuous.
---
I do however appreciate the polite discourse. Kudos to you, sir.
---
Spec 30 Feral / 21 Resto and wear full tier 1. Wildheart set if you don't have tier 1.
---
You actually don't need strength and agility for Feral PvP. You have good enough melee stats just from those 30 points in Feral. Then you kill people with a combination of melee damage, Moonfire, and Insect Swarm.
---
Eventually, when AQ comes out, you will be able to get a mace with a ton of Feral attack power on it. Your melee damage gets a lot better at that point. But you still want to spec 21 deep in Resto for Nature's Swiftness and Insect Swarm in pretty much any PvP build.
---
My server is 50/50, there’s ALWAYS someone to kill/get owned by. 5 in the morning, don’t matter. They’re there.
---
I'm shit at PVP and I want to understand how to be a bit less shit at PVP. What am I supposed to be doing, exactly, as a Feral Druid? 
---
In cat form, I just get disintegrated in seconds. In bear form, I last longer, but also can't deal shit all for damage and it just prolongs my suffering. People just constantly crit me for 1k+, sometimes even 1700 or so, while I'm happy if I can hit 600 on a clothie. When I need to heal, I never seem to be able to survive the 2 sec cast time for Regrowth, let alone anything more substantial.
---
What the hell do I actually need to do? Rolling on a PVP server was a mistake on my end, but I'd like to at least not be a walking sack of honor for literally any 60 that stumbles upon me while I'm trying to quest.
---
Totally agree with your post. I don't know where the hate comes from. Some people are just mad and want to degrade someone thanks to their own psychological baggage.
---
I say this with complete sincerity. If you are one for those people you need to find some help. From looking up how you can be more productive in conversation to unpacking your psychological baggage. You might think it's just a comment on a nothing thread, but the truth is that sort of behaviour is indicative of a much more pernicious mental state.
---
Had my first one last night. 4.6k!!
---
Moo?
---
Isn't it like 0.05% drop or something? You gonna farm that?
---
I'm pretty much in your shoes, I'm level 52 and can only play a couple hours per night max.  
---
Completely avoid any zones that are 50+.  You literally cannot do anything solo in those zones.  I've just been running ZF/Maraudon, leveling fishing, and doing quest/grinding in Tanaris/Feralas/Hinterlands, since they typically don't have roaming gank squads.  Once Battlegrounds come out (some time next week), I'm pretty sure we'll be able to quest again.
---
Not just hit, but the crit too. Fury is good because it scales so insanely well with crit. Every crit procs flurry, flurry makes you attack way faster.
---
More crit means better flurry uptime, better flurry uptime means more attack which means more crits which means more flurry uptime.
---
Arms is way less gear dependent and far more weapon dependent on its damage. While leveling getting one good weapon is far more reliable than continually building your entire gear set.
---
This doesn’t explain the standing and the blue post states that weekly totals after the weekly reset are accurate (which they aren’t).
---
&gt; is the super low drop rate.
---
...yes, I said that.
---
what is the definition of insanity?
---
You’re actually insane dude 🤣looking up my comment history because your having an argument wtf lol you realize people can have characters on both alliance and horde right? If you really read through all my history you’d see I don’t play on the same server
---
Back when I used to play on PvP realms I told my allies, if we all fight together we can survive, they didn't believe me. 
---
I'm happy that a large amount of people actually coordinated to survive
---
RFK would have some kind of hog
---
Ah yes, typical, can't win the argument -&gt; the opponent is arguing in bad faith. Thankfully debate class prepared me for disingenuous debaters such as yourself. Have some class and accept your defeat with some grace.
---
As someone who doesn’t pvp much. What about Paladins give alliance premades such a big edge?
---
Watching butthurt horde cry so much is endlessly entertaining
---
Yep, the classic pvp experience, from what I hear, is being ruined pretty quickly from server imba and items like these. Needs a lot of adjusting...but the problem is the player base, you can’t just force players to move.
---
Lol. Another person who joins a PvP server and complains about PvP.
---
Honor is honor and you my friend are easy pickins.
---
You're walking a fine-line with your vocab if you skip the definition and current technical usage, and instead use the Greek origins. A lot of words that derive from Greek roots don't mean the same exact thing they mean now.
---
Fury really kicks in after 30 but definitely at like 25 I think you get full flurry then? Its just way easier to grind single mobs as fury. Mutiple movs though, arms is flat out better.
---
They shouldn't be anything special. You don't even have cat form yet. It seems like the bracket where druids are OP should be 39 when you have travel form and others don't even have 60% mounts yet.
---
I know a short cut
---
What  comps did hunters play in TBC?
---
Or just... you know.... fly to burning steppes.  Just for the love of god... stop taking the "NO" path.  
---
Sincerely,
---
Someone who has killed SO many Alliance on the "No" path.

I had to scroll way too far down to find this comment.
---
It's almost like every other option takes just as long...
---
You must be on a PVE server
---
It might be possible against one target. Try it pulling 2 monsters at a time and sweeping strikes/whirlwind/cleave?
---
My warrior was my first 60 on classic and I leveled arms. I'm gonna hard disagree with you on it being slow. When you hit 40 and get mortal strike it's a game changer. I grouped with so many fury warriors while leveling who I just outpaced by a wide margin. To hell with fury.
---
I love the ability to punish poor behaviour this brings. I hate the potential for abuse it brings. Mainly concerned about people 1v1ing mages or hunters bringing these out to force those to disengage the fight.
---
It’s like a natural order meta tho.
---
Things are different from 2005.  Watching these plots to form DHK bombs is more in spirit with classic then anything before.
---
This is how alliance vs horde should be, on an extreme end.
---
Are you guys clearing MC/Ony in under 2-2.5 hours and are you downing rag in phase 1? Im guessing yes, just curious.
---
what r best pet talents for dire maul tribute runs as hunter ?
---
According to WClogs, warrior vs rogue is very close. Rogues average more DPS while warriors have slightly higher top end.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000/
---
Crawl through dungeon, open door before King with Seaforium charge and run to the beam to drop aggro.  
---
Then kite King and Observer near ramp on the left side of arena, abusing pathing. If you are good - only Observer will hit you with fireballs, while you dot King with a Moonfire and Swarm.
---
It's not 30 minutes, but solid 15 minutes.  
---
Or you could level yourself a mage or hunter :)
---
I'm not on a high horse. Maybe a high battle ram? Off with ye!
---
I deal with it as well, but I'm not going to pretend that the mouth-breathers going out of their way to chase level 48s down don't have a negative impact on the game as a whole. Yes pvp is part of the game. It doesn't mean you should abandon all sense of human decency to make the game unplayable for anyone that didn't have the unparalleled clairvoyance to hit 60 before phase 2 rolled out.

Player behavior is an important part of WoW Classic. Technically you can roll need on literally anything you see and more or less get away it. That probably has more marginal benefit for you in terms of vendor gold than the 0 honor you get from killing people outside instances.
---
&gt;PvP video
---
&gt;compilation of crit killshots
---
&gt;on a rogue, no less
---
Definitely a Chad move.
---
Depends what you want for leveling.
---
This is a pretty sick wPvP/leveling build for your bracket: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/3500200512201--05500001
---
Pretty much plays exactly like SM/Ruin at 60 in PvP. (Glass cannon)
---
Lots of dots, lots of burst. 
---
It's not *the most* efficient leveling build but it's definitely not bad and way better than just plain destro.
---
it's so disingenuous to say he's there to gank lowbies... 60s frequent the boat often, anyways enjoy your corpse runs :)
---
It now becomes impossible to rank in a situation where these are dying. It's not possible to compensate the losses these cause by just doing more HKs.
---
Any updates on this? I am 53 Alliance Mage, and I am having trouble picking the quest up.
---
It's a matter of perspective. Both factions camp choke points that are only used by runners from opposing faction.
---
But ally is the one that takes main points of interest (ie. BRM and DM).
---
Food water even..
---
I did most of this quest without the guides and forced myself to do so! But some parts took hours and days even thinking about it! Was a blast and I won’t give up that 14 slot bag for anything now.
---
Usually innervate myself after using all my mana form shifting to run away from hunters and warlocks
---
I don’t think there is a step API but with the X and Y coordinates taken at regular intervals you could approximate it. 
---
Makes me wonder is a gnomes gait shorter than a tauren?
---
You can still play after cancelling your subscription until your game time ends.
---
Imagine 20v1ing someone and thinking you're better than them... poor guy
---
Fixing exploits is only allowed if reddit complains about it
---
This will be fixed because reddit is complaining about it
---
-Being able to dispel 3 debuff types (magic, poison, disease)
---
-Blessing of Freedom
---
-BoP
---
-Bubble
---
-Super mana efficient heals
---
-Healer that can wear plate gear and a shield
---
Basically they're just super-defensive healers, and in organized battlegrounds, whichever team has the better healers tends to win.

---
There's one to get you started.
---
Yea I’m sure he just sits there and waves to the low level players when the higher level ones aren’t around. Get over yourself.
---
Servers like Herod and Skeram were already 70/30 when phase 2 launched and are already going closer to 80/20. Even the try hards will eventually leave when if this trend continues. Sorry your shit at the game and require 4v1 odds to feel good about yourself, but that mentality is going to kill your server.
---
No big guilds have left. It's either unknown smaller guilds or people are just trolling.
---
ye
---
People on my server end up dieing anywhere from 6 to 10+ times taking the no path...  I can only imagine what that does to someone's soul.
---
Are you actually surprised that someone who has basically been forced off a game they enjoyed by being ganked relentlessly by other players to the point they can’t play wouldn’t be happy to get some level of payback?
---
“Hey we’re gonna turn you in to a glorified NPC for our benefit with no ability to fight back and if you complain you’ll be told to go back to retail and to stop whining about PvP happening on PvP servers.... wait why do you have a grudge over this?”
---
It honestly makes me even more sad to see people saying “but I have to rank up so I have no choice”. Yeah guys, you do. You’re making it.
---
This made me laugh for hours! I just kept watching it over and over. "Fucking run" got me every time! XD
---
No, thats just classic.
---
Yeah I do
---
If someone is killing a quest NPC, you can actually make a macro that interacts with said NPC and accepts / turns in quests right away, generally faster that they can kill it.
---
Alternatively, you can make a group where players defend said NPC, who is static and likely conveniently close to a flight point for people of your faction to use. You know exactly where and when the enemy will strike.
---
There is far more counterplay for dealing with players killing quest NPCs, than there is for getting to a dungeon when the entire way is camped.
---
You mean you don't like it, yet still employ infantile sarcasm to convey a message.
---
no
---
I am absolutely flabbergasted that you are only at 350ish with an enchanted benediction. Benediction alone is 160 of that 350 meaning you are sub 200 with every other piece of gear combined. I feel like I stumbled over the 350 mark with a few runs of each level 60 dungeon, some quest rewards, and some high healing power level greens.
---
Compared to Vanilla, there was almost no wPvP prior to honor. Everyone was in a race to get to 60 in the first month or so of Classic, and since Honor had no rewards I imagine a lot of people thought PvP was a waste of time comparatively.
---
Layers made it especially difficult to find players, someone of the opposing faction could literally be on the same spot as you and you'd never see them.
---
1 agi &gt;  1 str
---
1 str = 2 ap
---
But he said *every* dungeon 😂
---
Eh, they'll hotfix it tbh, this is the kind of thing that'll make a lot of people stop playing if they're trying to rank and have this to run into.
---
I'm mostly tank geared (main tank), around 9 pre-bis pieces + cape of the black baron, and yeah, a couple greens in there. My stamina and armor and supposedly pretty good already, but that doesn't seem to make me die any less quickly.
---
It’s hard to sim the difference between 2h and DW but if you’re alliance then just go DW. If horde then 2h is good especially if you’re not an orc and get OEB.
---
Probably SM/DS  but DS/Ruin is pretty sick too if you use DS for the Voidwalker health regen
---
Yeah, it's called being a warrior.  
---
I just prefer games that have integrity and doesn't let exploits and cheats run rampart, because if it exists ingame then it's legitimate gameplay.
---
The problem is that sac doesnt stop pummel/kick/cs. Have you even tried void sac?
---
Herb/alchemy is always my primary Prof.  Especially on my warrior.   Having easy to make healing potions will save you hours of corpse runs.  It's also cheap and easy to level.
---
BFD: hydra!
---
&gt;Should’ve rolled horde
---
There, that's better :)
---
Why walk, when you can ride?
---
Farm gold. Befriend another warlock who has the mats for starting the event in DM:W
---
shitty healers imo
---
Arcanite crystal farming with skinning in Winterspring yeti caves.
---
&gt; the time that would take
---
Lol you really are clueless. Its kinda cute.
---
There are two options. If you want horde go Orc. If you want alliance go gnome. As an orc the stun resist is too good. As alliance you will never lose Alterac Valley.
---
Mostly read up on Garr
---
Mellon!
---
If you truely think that the orc racial isn’t stupidly broken then you have never played an alliance class with a stun.
---
&gt;Nonsense instalocked Alliance nonsense
---
That we do.  I'm alliance and tons of people to quest with, but I feel bad for the Horde.
---
I disagree honestly. MC is such a cakewalk, all that matters is Frostspellpower to get some competition out of the rather lame bossfights. Besides, the coefficients on the AOE spells are so bad you need a lot more spell power than preraid BiS offers to actually feel a difference.
---
1500g on firemaw, Alliance.

Is 1% haste really better than Agi/Str?

Gz on world first epic flying in Classic Wow!

---
There, that's better:)
---
Oh s*** haha good call, know of any good ways to check this?
---
Ya I use it when I am pulling two or three mins at once typically. And have already cleared most of the mobs in the area. The last few I just pull together dot, fear, auto attack, chase after one and try to drop it and the others just come right back to you like a boomerang :)
---
Why would a PvE guild (the type that needs a PvP escort lol) care about DHKs lol? They're not ranking, so it's whatever to them?
---
Faerlina, full
---
&gt;:)
---
It’s like the plane scene from temple of doom
---
It was the opposite in my memory but I never actually looked up any data, I just kept hearing people say that they gave the pretty BEs to horde to boost their popularity because they had lower numbers.
---
It's taking you to Hogwarts.
---
Play a single player game, then. I hear theyre great for people who don't want to socialize.
---
Apes: ”Now this looks like a job for me”
---
My cousin did 10-60 via BG’s nearly exclusively towers the end of vanilla, so yes it’s entirely possible.  You don’t get exp for the BG itself, but the quests reward decent exp and will level you.  It’s not optimal by any means in terms of pure leveling speed, but it’s definitely doable and arguably far more fun if you really enjoy BG’s / PvP.  Also has the advantage of maxing out the various factions while you level.
---
That’s actually really helpful, thank you!!
---
I think deadmines should have an aquatic pirate ship mount
---
&gt;I'm horde, but feel entitled enough to talk shit
---
I remember lunchmoney flipping the fuck out at zoomie for not taking his TF off during twin emps.
---
I remember seeing a post about 2 people in the same raiding guild that happened to be in the same classes in college. One had most of theirs done (cant remember the reason) and had only like 4 classes while the other had a full plate. The one with 4 classes passed his classes but with a struggle while the other failed the classes and had to quit the guild to try and succeed
---
Oh you mean start over.  Ugh.  In my 50's that's tough.
---
Well that means everything that happens in any future expansion is Thralls fault? Are you telling me all we are going through in humanities history is Evas fault??
---
You mean like all the people (myself included as a horde player) who stopped playing because of P2 "PvP"?
---
Im just trying to finish hitting 60... I don't care how many DHKs you get if it gets some people/guilds to fuck off for a while
---
get 5 set bonus, tier 1
---
This. Is. Genius. You are a hero to the solo community.
---
My guild has a warrior glut and we would kill for a feral OT to alleviate gear pressure and decurse on some fights
---
Why would you die easier? They both have soul link
---
This is a dumb suggestion, other side of the gorge is always camped and u run into gang gangs from kargath. The corpse run to the other side of the gorge is 300% longer b/c no path to other side of the gorge forcing you to normal run speed around the entire thing.
---
and? 1 fake cast to taunt the kick and youre good to go
---
Can I ask what weapon you're using?
---
I was given the eye of sulfuras so I will be using the hand of rag as soon as we got the mats ready. I know I wont be top dps or anything but someone had to take it, so I stepped up :p
---
We've also been really unlucky with 1h drops so I though I'd lessen the queue a bit.
---
I mentioned the Buckaroo reference on the way ZF one day and none of my guildies knew what I was talking about. I was dissapointed and told them all to make sure to watch it but I don't think any of them did.
---
Classic Warriors = Vanilla Hunters.
---
I didn't think that was available in classic?
---
Complex question, but I'll answer for rogue vs frost mage:
---
If you don't have Prep, don't bother.  
---
With Prep, you'll need to carefully use all of your distance breaker cooldowns (double vanish, double blind, and double improved sprint if you spec into it) in order to catch up to the mage. Grenades, Gnomish Net, and Frost Reflector all help a lot in this too if you have engineering.
---
If all of your cooldowns are down and the mage gets distance, it's game over for you. If the mage runs out of cooldowns (no barrier, block, frost nova) and you're on top of him, you win.
---
That will change with AQ and Naxx, so I am willing to be patient.
---
Classic is nice because as long as I can find a reasonable group, I can focus on farming my BiS... and I know what that is, unlike retail where itemization doesn't matter and if you don't like speedruns, the endgame isn't designed for you. I know how to play this game, so I like it.
---
Fair enough, never tried 2h fury in 60 dungeons
---
Reminds me of the broken ones in WOD
---
Limited Invulnerability Potions (Everyone needs one) : at the start of Phase 3 have whomever gets aggro pop the potion until a Tank has aggro. Problem solved.
---
And ring.
---
Bird was just pissed you made fly in one place for a couple days or it was really tired from all thst flying and it forgot where it was going. Be nice to the gryphons.
---

---
If only they used key binds. Then they wouldn’t have died. 🤔
---
Yep, I gave it a play back then and got to max level and fiddled around for a while. It didnt keep my attention at the end game, but I enjoyed leveling a Rogue/Archer and a Spellcaster to max level. The whole Souls/Talent system was interesting.
---
Best WoW clone of all the clones.
---
An organized guild would get 50 to a hundred HKs there with sappers.
---
They were just offering free transfers a couple of weeks ago I don’t know if they still are.
---
Yah.....maybe that works on horde. You should try that on alliance when there is twice as many horde that want to corpse camp you.
---
Actually, if you're Horde, the safest approach is from the south thru burning steppes. And even better is not just flying there, but taking the zepp to Gromgol and running thru duskwood and redridge so you can grief the alliance noobs on along the way.
---
pVp oN a PvP sERvEr. Please just stop. Camping every single FP in the game and corpse running 10+ times to BRM is not what anyone had in mind when we rolled on a PvP server.
---
&gt;I mean, this totally happens.
---
And is totally unethical. We view civilian casualties as a problem in war. A reason as flimsy as that is not legitimate.
---
&gt; The eye is a tool the enemy is using to act against you. Disarming the enemy of that tool is what any sane military strategist would do and is not "dishonorable." If an enemy is using guns to try and harm your allies, disarming them of their weapons is a valid non-dishonorable action to take. This has literally nothing to do with gun rights.
---
You can disarm them humanely. You can CC the people casting the eye (5 second cast time -&gt; have to keep channeling), you can avoid engaging them while they channel (1 min duration), you can use single target spells to fight them. You have so many options available to you, you don't have to kill the eye, so it's only fitting that if you choose to do so out of convenience, you are at least punished for it.
---
\#SaveEyes #2A
---
He's obviously pretty good but using multiple engineering tools and potions 1v1 is laughable.
---
"Imagine if we'd walk the entire way!"
---
"It's funny because it's extremely far"
---
I too had someone stop me and correctly guess the server I played on in classic. Apparently I used to gank him a lot, and I guess the horrors were burned into his memory. Was pretty crazy to think after all this time another person remembered a character I used to play.
---
I think this glitch is triggered by logging back in after logging out on a mount for a few days. Am I right?
---
Well think about the core of how you determine bis - you have to actually recreate the mechanics of combat and see how the stats interact. None of these lists have really done that - the fight club spreadsheet is by far the best source because it’s backed up with the actual math. 
---
Try it out with your exact gear setup and compare - the results are really interesting especially when you do it with world buffs, and without
---
I still say incendius is prob the best server on the list, pretty even pop 45-55H and strong organized guilds on both sides, can always expect good fights and not just all the time one sided deathballs.
---
Wasn’t this one the collecting the water samples from Azshara?
---
Either way, fuck the forsaken. Make the Horde Honorable Again.
---
I was on alliance agamaggan as well lol. Small world
---
Real talk since phase 2 hit I’m so glad to be a paladin. I will get to the instance, slowly but it’s happening. No shame with bubble hearthin either. They gotta earn this honor kek
---
Idk what auctioneer addon im using but when i sell staff it show list of that item with all prices and automaticly enters lowest by few silver. I do check if lowest prices isnt someone that just droped price for like 50% but its rearly a case. and hey if I sell item for price that happens to be lower then market value, buy it and resell, its just so easy.
---
Btw if u want automatic scaning of AH get TSM addon.
---
Take your pick of sources. Missing out on flurry and deathwish neuters your dps.
---
There's always a bigger ~~fish~~ raid
---
Classic bugs are classic!
---
Say you are SM/Ruin. 
---
See you can get Siphon Life on him in between stuns.
---
&gt; there was almost no wPvP prior to honor
---
Are you on a PvE server or just an empty one? On my server horde were camping the boats often and BRM almost constantly even before honor. The only thing that's changed is unless you catch the 5 minutes between Alliance cleaning out BRM and the 3 more horde raid groups coming to back up the 2 we had to kill to get control, you average closer to 6–8 corpse runs to get to any of the instances rather than 2–3.
---
Well yes. Horde outnumbering and murdering people because they expect that it will get them honor, but then losing honor because they're mindlessly AoEing lowbies is pretty ironic.
---
Shifting in and out of travel form costs very little mana, and every time you poly you're giving them a free heal. Not the best call really.
---
So you're saying there's zero chance that could happen in a small skirmish?
---
Cleave ww with sweeping strikes and a fat 2hander is pretty dope tho.
---
Even on my Alliance rogue it takes more than 1 death every time. Maybe if its like 4 am you might only take 1 death
---
Dire Maul - an ogre that picks you up and carries you over it’s head.  Dismount looks like you were body slammed

You can transfer, as far as I'm aware. May not be available yet but PVP to PVE Transfers are or will be an option afik.
---
Epic gamer humor XDDDD

Essentially 0 between reasonably aware players, and if it does happen to you, it's 100% your fault. You have so many ways to avoid it. PvP on a PvP server, take it as a lesson and improve instead of complaining.
---
so tired of seeing these posts, the alliance tears are an ocean now
---
Free action potion. Mainly for pvp
---
That’s literally only talking about autos and goes on to point out that you are missing out on damage for overpower, mortal strike, whirlwind, etc. and that’s why everyone runs 2h, not autos.
---
Classic wow classic quiver thread, such a classic.
---
320 ish here.  Got hoj on 3rd run but no sav glad yet
---
There is a shitton of small thorium nodes in nethergarde keep. They seem to respawn fast too.
---
You put it very well. I just want to be able to quest again. FeelsBadMan.
---
i agree but not sure what they could do. like making them into dhks would be one approach but would make large scale pvp basically impossible
---
No, I do like it.
---
the logic makes no sense
---
honor only matters to be compared with your own faction during that week so while you might earn much more honor with BGs so does your entire faction and you end earning the same number of actual rank points
---
Stock up now or cry later, it's your choice
---
Good locks use shadowburn in a raid setting with improved shadow bolt stacks since that increase shadow dmg by a % the higher the stack count the better
---
To the right of the imp go to the edge, aim for the rock below.
---
You think so? Hm, I'll think about it :) Thanks for your support!
---
No, mages are the new hunter.
---
Is there an easy way out?
---
DAoC had these. For a while in vanilla DAOC they were called Critblades, their opening attacks with 2h were known for nearly 1 shotting casters.
---
But that slow 2h came with a long wait for attack #2 to finish them off, lol.
---
or get app on pc and it will all the time autoscan also showing how many time item is put up so you can see how popular it is.
---
Aah, maybe that could explain it! I thought it might be something of the like!
---
Honestly didnt even really need actual tanks for the wrath version.
---
So you're complaining that pvp happened?
---
Nightfall gives you some improvements towards drain life
---
your main dmg spell as SL/NF is Drain Life
---
Didn’t actually read your post. Just sharing my experience. It was fun in SM and ZF tbh but once the rest of the leveling herd caught up BrD became a nightmare. 
---
It’s exactly what i signed up for when I was ahead of the leveling curve but once the masses caught up in the 50s the problems with population sizes became apparent
---
The punishment for not being on time to MC is repeated corpse walks into BRM.
---
Not transparent but nobody has /gquit and some people were really upset, so it must be going, I guess, decent? :P
---
In your scenario youre saccing when low hp, you dont really have much time to fake cast even with vw shield up. Average people pvping on classic know about fake casting and will wait the first one, kick the 2nd.  Since you *did* sac at low hp, you dont have much room to fake cast 2 or even *3* times because its a desperation mode move. Youre going to get kicked.
---
How its fuck up economy ?
---
Also an acceptable answer.
---
Your list is alright but a good warlock should have a bind for each curse and each pet ability. Each pet aside from imp has great abilities against certain classes for example you beat a lot of caster with fel hunter by being able to interrupt and dispel key debuffs or buffs.
---
&gt;How is 2h fury as Ally?
---
&gt;but on Alliance it isn't as good
---
From the Alliance tunnel. There's a gate on the southeast of Dun Morogh. Requires a key or rogue lockpicking.
---
correct
---
why, what i do doesn't affect you. If boxxers bother you so much why don'y you go play a single player game?
---
My toaster is an attack helicopter and could beat up your toaster.
---
Alright!! Thanks :)

Is what I found, as I only know to try to log into my BNet account on the desktop app, which I am assuming you don't want to do on your work machine.
---
The ports for wow are 3724, 1119, 6012. Ports for BNet app are  80, 443, 1119.
---
Hopefully this is slightly helpful, as I am also not super in tune with how to check, just with how to forward.
---
IF you are tight with the IT guy I would suggest asking to get those ports forwarded. May just work for ya.
---
Or else the dedicated PvPers on your server are gonna exclude you from future BG farming etc.
---
It's normal on any halfway decent server for PvPers to "collude". On my server apparently the top guys have agreed to have a "ceasefire" at 180,000 honor.
---
On Nostalrius I think people agreed to stop at 1,000,000 honor weekly.
---
Not sure, my DME runs are just the lashers in the conservatory so I’m not killing any bosses.     
---
I just log out for about 5 minutes which puts me up beside the Imp/entrance portal again and then run outside to reset the instance.      
---
This won’t be ideal if you’re trying to min/max gold per hour.
---
My first thought is a scarlet crusade themed mount in strat live. That would be dope.
---
Griffon gf calls  
---
her: im home alone  
---
him: alright my dude we taking a shortcut, hold on!
---
Agreed. I was just saying how he could OP if he really wanted to given how much he spams it from his logs lol.
---
So let me get this straight.  You rolled on Faerlina without knowing it was a streamer server AND beat the streamers leveling up to a point?  BS
---
Nobody forces you to reach for such info
---
There's probably been at least 200+ 60s transfering in the past 48 hours, your entire faction will soon be just PvE players ;)
---
Yeah guys let's not jump to a riot they have only had 15 years!
---
Much appreciated!
---
I mean at this point a lot of guilds are basically one night clearing MC already, they should have a second or even a third raid setup that you could volunteer to MT for.
---
Not worth the time since those areas are constantly patrolled. Just going to level my fishing and help lowbies till the 10th.
---
&gt; Yet I'm sure you use the research we did over many years to be better at the game..
---
Weren't all the strategies well known and documented while vanilla was still running, 15 years ago? What new insights did the private servers supposedly provide?
---
Ok so unaware players deserve getting a DHK? Why can't you win the fight fairly? Why do you have to try and cheese a dishonorable kill?
---
people in this thread have broken fucking brains i swear  
---
"an in-game item that allows players to give each other DHK is fine" lmao, no it isn't my bro  
---
a rogue could, for fun, stealth around until he finds a mage or shaman doing a 1v1, cast the eye and run it into the fight, and suddenly the mage or shaman can't use any aoe spells or risk getting a DHK.  
---
and don't even tell me that situation is unrealistic.  
---
Barring the use to disperse packs at the flight paths (informally I kinda agree but its still unequivocally wrong), shit like that could *easily* happen in random 1v1's anywhere.
---
In a while you'll be going 'In my late 50's thats tough'.
---
Reroll. Type /pvp. And remove the flag if you're getting ganks squads or corpse camped.
---
I am horde on sulfuras.
---
Im all for these to count as Dhks in open world because big fights are silly cheese aoe sapper garbage. However, I think to allow that in battlegrounds is just silly and dirty, it would stop a lot of players from ever queing up wsg or av. I can’t be alone in thinking this. BG’s would die!
---
Boo-hoo then.
---
That sucks, I've never even seen it drop. It is technically BiS for hunters, but I hear they can replace it with their Tier 1 chest. Warriors don't get a replacement for a long time, supposedly. Again, great itemization Blizz.
---
Nothing.
---
This is hilarious. Sure it doesn’t seem that bad as horde with twice as many people. Maybe you should try alliance so you can actually see what we are talking about.
---
im pretty sure those are not the same people\^\^
---
Agreed. One kill is fine but camping just wastes both yours and their time.
---
Every 2 seconds, your frost trap has 5/10/15/20/25% chance to root the target for 5s. It has no DR and can proc while the root is active.
---
You can get targets permarooted for 15+ seconds if you're lucky.
---
It only works on the initial tick of immo/explosive trap though.
---
Hehe I know right? Love when people say how everyone in the game is so much more skilled and knowledgeable than before.
---
Nope.. the better players back then were really good, the bad players today are really bad.
---
This is pretty much how I view every post complaining about not being able to level in p2.  It’s a big case of “I’ve tried nothing and I’m all out of ideas”.
---
Many thanks !
---
How do you know they wont buff the spawn rate like devilsaur and elementals?
---
I'm guessing you have none of the decent loot from BRD.  I saw 1 HoJ in over 95 runs.  Another rogue in guild was over 140 runs on Anger, never saw it.  And it's not even the hardest piece to get in the dungeon -- good luck farming an Ironfoe.
---
I was thinking of buying a bunch and saving them for when they go up in price, but then i remembered they severely reduced the devilsaur spawn time part way into classic, so i'm hesitant. 
---
Either way, come AQ and Naxx, the cost of consumables and weekly respecs is probably going to push many away from keeping up with content and into a more casual routine.
---
After phase 2 launch is perfect, the imbalanced factions is the problem, they should have done faction based queues from the start
---
&gt; they did it to themselves.
---
It's true! And that's why it really hurts.
---
You can only fight the people you find and it's pretty clear that they *really* know the druid class.
---
Wtf is this mage doing...
---
Won't know for sure til P3 though it's looking like the profession turn-ins should be open to all. Either way [I am ready](https://i.ibb.co/TbrG2Sg/DMF-CACHE.jpg).
---
If battlegroups end up mixing PvP and PvE servers the queue differences wont be NEARLY as big as people seem to be saying. Vanilla battlegroups kept PvP and PvE servers separate but it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if they changed things up this time around.
---
Just denying a whiny bitch.
---
I'm pretty sure the key needs to be in the bank
---
the other 2% is hand of justice procs which never crit
---
That is not at all how it's "always" been, looking for more implies you actually have the start of a group, not just yourself.
---
Yes, on most pvp servers in vanilla the alliance were the largest faction.
---
Click your lockpick icon then the door, that should work.
---
Quit then.
---
Imagine it being reliable.
---
Basilisk mounts already exist in retail.
---
Sorry guys no changes.
---
Hey sorry. I haven’t been on reddit in a long time, I got the 23 days from your post.
---
“ I know this scenario happened to many people too. We need paid transfers because I am not going to reroll 23 days played of my life. “
---
What’s hilarious is your reading comprehension, alliance post up multiple raid groups in BRM on tuesdays, they also at varying times will hold every major PvP farm area, when that happens I take my 3ish corpse runs, adds 5-10 minutes on and go about my life.
---
The incessant whining of alliance members who bizarrely refuse to rez properly like everybody else, is just scrubby nonsense
---
When is it dropping? AQ/Naxx.
---
Honestly, this is the kinda direct route I need in my life.
---
This was basically my friend and I in retail during wrath. Started with 5 tanks,  two with seniority, and they all slowly wilted away leaving me and him with core spots for several years.
---
The anal goblin invaders just sound excessively orderly and fussy...
---
If you're levelling, just use whatever weapon has the best DPS for you. 
---
Ideally, you aren't going to be fighting a lot of monsters that are even level or higher (unless you're doing dungeons) so the benefit of +5 on weapon skill isn't going to be a huge factor for you. 
---
The +5 is useful once you hit 60 because you're largely going to be fighting things that are higher level than you.
---
I'm just glad that I made to to 60 a couple weeks before the shit hit the fan. It's been pretty terrible but at least I can play on an alt or find some secluded place to farm for a while before some rogue comes and ganks me.
---
Yeah honestly for PvP that's what I've found on my druid. HotW spec but focusing on large health/mana pools works really really well.
---
I've played a rogue main since vanilla so it's hard not to try and fall back to being a rogue, but if you try that as a druid you will only succeed in being a really bad discount rogue.
---
Why was this deleted?? This is a great thing
---
He wants easy mode
---
yeah not curse of elements, sorry for the confusion.  I was thinking of putting 3 points in it for 25% base / 55% amplified.
---
I get what you are saying, I am weighing it between the utility of that slow or some increased damage with 6% imp drain life or 6% curse of agony.  25/55% sounds useful on paper, not sure how much utility it offers.
---
A WC thunder lizard seems appropriate.
---
If your spreadsheet is telling you to down rank that far with sub 200 healing power throw it out dude. Don't be that guy, theory craft healers are always too rigid to be good healers. Healing is dynamic, it's picking the right spell for the right situation in a split second. Your spreadsheet doesn't mean dick if your tank is about to die and you're sitting through a gheal cast bar instead of shielding and flash healing. 
---
Here's the non math nerd barometer for your heal spell, use the one that averages 1100 per cast, whatever rank that is. 
---
Regarding Greater Heal, no one mains greater heal unless they have 8/8 transcendence and even then they only cast it to get the second renew up. The more mana intensive the heal the more you have to be reactive, that's a bad approach. You want to be proactive and when you're proactive even Greater 1 becomes and excessive use of mana. It's easier to be proactive with a down ranked heal, it becomes a situation where even if you let one go and over heal you're spending a small amount of mana and getting another chance to proc inspiration.
---
You know those are all extremely small number statistics and are largely dominated by the guilds whose members use those addons?
---
Blizzard broke addons that actually tracked population. The truth is no one actually knows. But the most recent census that was unbiased showed 45:55
---
Thanks so much for that! :) I appreciate the help!
---
give us another way to view the ladder
---
They reduced devilsaur spawn times???
---
Grobbulus is like this
---
I believe with the release of bgs things will calm down and in one month we will have organic wpvp. 
---
I avoid brm like the plague since p2 was out, it's not fun nor I have the spare time to corpse walk for an hour. I just hope I am right on this one.
---
He warned them!Even said stay away from tail and whelps and warrior pulls 20 of them smh..
---
Nothing says pvp like running away and not getting a hk...
---
I'm skeptical of faction based queues because it means the solution to the problem of people not being able to play the game properly is to prevent others from playing it entirely. I mean, I agree it would solve the problem... but the resulting problem would be even bigger.
---
Although, if they coupled the faction based queues with making transfers available so people in the over populated faction could just leave... well, that I could work! Given overall faction in balance the transfers might have to be to PVE servers, but still.
---
i too would love to see a source about that, because it would explain a helluva lot about the lore fuckery of BC
---
I use it mainly to buy things, fuck sorting through 20 pages of single stack items, or someone who lists pages of singles at 70s with a low bid for an item worth 5s trying to trick people. With auctioneer I find the cheapest price immediately and can buy as many as I want.
---
Math is crap and the 44% upvote shows. I could go into detail why its shit if you'd like
---
I did a TON of testing on this on private servers before Classic came around and the difference in time to kill on single mobs between 2h and DW was mostly negligible at all levels during the leveling process. Sometimes 2H is a little faster, sometimes DW is a little faster.
---
The advantage of Arms is that you have better aoe, while the advantage of Fury is that you have less downtime.
---
Yea these warriors are brain dead
---
Yeah it's a server population problem. Not the players camping hks off you being 'meanies'. On my server both sides do this and nobody cares.. we all love it.. it's the game we wanted to play...
---
&gt; Wailing Caverns
---
A Skum mount would also be awesome!
---
Have you considered going double monitor? :)

Found the horde that cant pvp unless its 10v1!
---
Great scene! I never saw that before :)
---
Maybe the quest version of the yeti is a civilian and the version you get as a reward is not.
---
Yeah I think it happened when layers were removed.

---
I don't personally farm them, but remember reading about it here and in general chat.
---
so this should not be patched and then someone gets to use it in AV during the teamfight at any chokepoint and bomb the entire enemy raid? seems legit
---
yes this works
---
It was 15 minutes at launch, they later changed it to 5 minutes.
