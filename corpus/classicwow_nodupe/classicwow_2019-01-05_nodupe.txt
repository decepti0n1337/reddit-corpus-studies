Might be ideal. But the extra damage saves what, 1 holy nova? so doesn't improve downtime by that much. Pally for kings / wisdom? Hunter + volley adds another pet with growl to pick up any that might fall through the cracks?
---

---
The base is 3x warlock 1x priest for &lt; 10 second pack kills - the extra spot means anyone can plan to put a group together for this. Some are just better than others.

---
Why is it a bad idea?
---
&gt;There won’t be 500-1000 people in one arena
---
Are you nuts? The server caps will be way higher from the sounds of it because everyone is going to leave. So each server on start day will have at least 6k people. 1k at least in each starter area. They don't want to merge servers so day one servers will be huge.
---
Who knew that Wailing Caverns was preparing us for Naxx
---
i'll nitpick the bis'ness of rune of the guard captain if need be, but i think we are mostly in agreement with the larger conclusion: 1.4 and 1.5 quests *probably* belong in at launch and the level 50 class quests *might not* belong in at launch.
---
Probably rush boss although the tank shouldn't take too much adds on himself because he will die. 
---
Instead, fear them, use pets to taunt them, sheep them anything that you have available. 
---
Killing adds is a valid tactic as well but that depends on how good your healer is.
---
Generally, if the healer is good, go with killing adds, if the dps is good then nuke the boss. If neither is good... well be sure to check the time, you might have spent few hours inside deadmines considering you got to VS so probably missed school.
---
They REALLY need to extend the content windows in Classic. People need to be right at the edge of unsubbing just as the next content window drops.  
---
Why do Blizzard need to put the man power in at all?
---
Didn't get the loot you were supposed to get? Unfortunate, try again. Is that so terrible for people?
---
Mulgore and Durotar only lead into Barrens what are you talking about? Teldrassi into Darkshore. Trisifal into Silverpine. Elywin to Westfall. Dun Morogh into Loch Modan. 1k people going into these regions will need sharding by the sounds of it. I don't care for overcrowding.
---
For speed running NOTHING is better than 2hand warrior tank, 3 warriors and a shaman.
---
Because 15 min for cancelling or missing a queue is insane?
---
in this scenario it wouldn't be this, say specifically ubrs where u would run it with 15 or so, and there are at least 4 melee dps, 3 of which are friends with 2 of those hiding their own truestrike shoulders, and then needing on them when they drop. the melee dps that isn't part of the friends group doesn't even realise he is getting cheated out of a 50/50 to a 75/25, and this is the problem people are talking about when they bring this up. there is no way to see this happening unless you already knew they had the shoulders
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, a mage for water and more aoe damage would be pretty neat then i suppose. Anyway, i like the idea and i hope you can pull it off if youll actually try it, ill be rolling a warlock so im up for it if we end up on the same server :)
---
The server caps will be 2500 according to all the current evidence we have 
---
Afaik Ironforge has the same layout for its inn.
---
Shame blizzard shot it in the back of the head
---
I like your idea - I'm always in favor of people trying out unconventional builds.
---
There are a few things I disagree with:
---
Rend is NOT worth the purchase while leveling.
---
**I was about to write quite a large paragraph here.. changed my mind, since it boils down to:
---
Rend is not necessarily much better in terms of damage to rage ratio than heroic strike.
---
Rends dps is bad - no matter how you twist and turn it, it's a sad warrior fact.
---
You COULD spend precious gold purchasing rend and spend 3 talent points skilling it.. which MIGHT barely increase your leveling speed (but then again, it might not).
---
Or you could spend the same gold on potions, a new piece of gear and a pretty shirt.
---
Secondly I don't think spending 18 points in the def tree for improved thunder armor is worth it for your playstyle.
---
It's 18 points for 15 rage per fight.
---
10 Points in cruelty and unbridled wrath will already give you a comparable "rage per fight" bonus for almost half the points.
---
Just thinking about these two things already make me question the efficiency of your build. Sorry, I highly doubt it's as effective as fury.
---
But again, I do appreciate your thought, and if you want to roll with it - more power to you! At the end of the day it's not gonna impact your overall leveling speed that much anyways.
---
&gt;mage
---
Oh... Counterspell would force any casters to run into melee (and the hellfire) yeah? If so, another point to mages.
---
You’ll realistically only get ~4 seconds of stun on every mob because all the warlocks are constantly reapplying the stun and it’s almost immediately DR’d. 
---
You need a tank and you need to give 5 seconds to build aoe threat. At least that’s how I was able to use this strat in strat living. I’d cast regrowth+rejuv, bear form and corner pull and then spend 5-10 seconds generating aoe threat before nuking them down. In pre raid bis gear I’d always need to tank the hits for a couple seconds before they died. 
---
I haven’t tested this at lower levels though and strat living is believed to be the most difficult 5 man so maybe things would die faster at lower levels.
---
Very few toons jump to the other continent for their start because of the railed nature of the early quests. If Barrens is too crowded, Silverpine is an option. Or vice versa, though that would be more rare. 
---
Again, in the past, the vast majority of players stopped before 10. And, since people level at different speeds, not everyone in the zone is trying to kill the exact same mobs at the same time, unlike trying to kill mindless zombies on your first killing quest, for example. 
---
As a Druid main I am ashamed I never knew that. 
---
A hard no on multiqueueing I cannot agree with. Without it, say goodbye to AB and AV unless there's a double honor weekend or in the case of AV, its release.
---
I didn't play every classic pserver. I didn't play Nost and I didn't play at least two other major launches. However, on the ones that I have played, WSG remains the only BG that pops. This includes servers where you are allowed to queue multiple BGs but the queue drops when you accept. Which will always be a WSG, since it fills up faster due to needing fewer people.
---
And people haven't seemed to like it, as there doesn't go a day without complaints in the world chat about a lack of variety in BGs.
---
Casuals don't have a problem with dodgers. They have a problem with the underlying issue of why there even are dodgers in the first place. They face a premade. BGs and the honor system weren't created "for premades to compete". Premades popped up as the most efficient way to gain honor in a chaotic system. Dodging, a direct response to other premades, is even more efficient. It requires an extra step, but premades already do over pugs.
---
Even a good premade can be the ones starting to dodge. It's still more efficient for the best premade to dodge if they face 10min games vs pugs, and face 20min games vs premades. Why play 14hrs a day, when you can cut some off the top and achieve identical results?
---
A lack of variety seems just as big of a reason to avoid PvP as dodgers do. If not bigger. "I run into premades all the time and it's no fun" doesn't stop being said at 40% occurence as opposed to 80%. 80 is worse, but 40 is still fucking awful for the average player. It's basically a coinflip on whether it's even worth queueing or not. 
---
“/2 Red Glow, 50s or free with your mats! SW Bank steps”
---
Shhh, let's pretend that doesn't exist.
---
you could do bosses w/o a tank just with the lock pets tbh
---
Right click add player to b.net friend list.
---
I hope and seem to have a faint memory of it being said that this won't be doable cross-faction for Classic, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
I looked around and found this.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7yas6p/servercap_was_never_2500/
---
https://i.imgur.com/yNWkujT.png
---
Yeah so Vanilla was onl 2500 but the reddit post talks that it could somehow get up to 3500-4k with queue somehow, I'm not sure.
---
So then the question is why do we even need sharding?
---
The day I first saw this icon I was like "Oh, it's like a glowing eagle. that's cool."
---
I didn't even question it until this day... twelve years later.
---
A lot of people quitting are due to the fact that your character might be deleted one day, server might be gone. Drama bullshit and no server to go to.
---
There are other reasons but people will leave once Naxx is over but people who enjoy a good mmo will play that until there is something new and good. 
---
WoW is not a single-player game though.
---
hmm, fair point. i have never had an issue being honored with ironforge on a human by the time i get to wetlands.  if you do some dun morogh (for the compact hammer, e.g.) and all the good bits of loch modan, you should be fine.
---
actual classic mileage may vary though, so it's a fair point.
---
That's one thing I though. 3x blueberries should be able to manage alright.
---
But then there are 8 more classes to get BiS in!
---
&gt;Silverpine is an option.
---
How? Each starting point will be too overcrowded which will need sharding.
---
&gt;And, since people level at different speeds, not everyone in the zone is trying to kill the exact same mobs at the same time, unlike trying to kill mindless zombies on your first killing quest, for example.
---
How does that matter? Just doing the quests and finishing them will be no longer then 4 hours with sharding because no one will have to wait for spawns. So everyone will get too Darkshore or wherever together.
---
Stone skin is amazing in PvP and potentially the best class racial. If you’re considering PvP over PvE roll dwarf to insta-gib rogues. Human if vice versa
---
For PvE, stoneskin has its used definitely but it’s outweighed by the sword and mace speciality that humans have. All in all, roll whichever race you want because it’s only a min max thing - if you’re a better geared dwarf you’ll get a raid spot than a worse geared human 
---
I rolled a priest and felt it was the best counter to the hunter. I never had a problem with many people actually.  I kinda feel it was a underplayed class at the 19 bracket. 
---
I...feel pretty old...does that answer your question?
---
You're not even lying lol. I watched a video of a warrior tanking Heigan and he was clicking.  
---
There's a mildly popular pserver undead warrior streamer who was tanking Naxx and he clicks also.  
---
I was blown away when I saw both of those.  
---
I think it's an interesting idea. Have you ran the numbers on an average mob's armor and how much stacking sunder would actually increase your damage by?
---
And also, are you considering that by committing to the idea of saving rage for the next fight, you're basically giving up execute?
---
One positive of spamming sunder armor is that it would give you many chances to proc overpower.
---
I would also consider parry chance over heroic strike/rend in the first tier of arms. Parry makes you take less damage and brings your next white swing quicker, and kind of a minor thing in this case, but the more parry chance you have, the higher the value of parry becomes. If you parry 90% of attacks, then by adding 5% parry you just reduced your incoming damage by 50%.
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
Monkeynews is a pretty decent warrior, especially for PvP. He might have some tips on his YouTube Channel. 
---
I found https://youtu.be/KzQ4P6huu6M pretty informative too. 
---
which blizzard are we talking about? Blizzard now or Blizzard from 14 years ago. I trust Blizzard from 14 years ago with Classic Wow. I don't know who in their right mind would trust the current Blizzard WoW dev team.
---
r/realwowicons
---
I felt a sense of pride by knowing where to go in instances.  
---
I know that's arrogant of me, but I liked helping the group find their way through WC/ST/BRD/etc. It was fun.  
---
going for improved demo shout is highly underrated imo, as demo shout reduces their dmg by about 30% so 40% more on that is 42% dmg reduction, this really helps with downtime
---
Name a second hunter pre raid bis trinket. Say HOJ and I'll find u irl.  
---
Jokes aside. I don't think we should have the Anathema, Rhok'delar and Onyxia head quests at launch, as it hurts the longevity of the game.  
---
Personally, I don't mind have Rhok'delar at launch as it makes Striker's Mark a Melee weapon, however, I really do feel like having those put in the game later on will help the game overall.
---
You shouldn't be so surprised. Just understand that Classic WoW is going to be a repeat of WoW.
---
Blizzard fans are among the most naive, gullible, easy to abuse people in gaming and it's as evident here as anywhere else. 
---
Might also be a hand wiping up some blood with a bloody rag.
---
If you let the queue sit there for two minutes and didn't accept because you went AFK or were alt-tabbed, then you DESERVE to be punished, because you just put your team at a disadvantage. At that point in time, your team is rolling out of the gates and meanwhile someone else is going to have to load in, assuming they click the queue instantly. 
---
If you knew you weren't going to be able to play, then, knowing that there is a 15 min penalty, why didn't you leave the queue as soon as you figured that out?
---
I mean... technically I guess Activision could be *conspiring* to cut costs of the game and maximize profits. Conspiracy theory doesn't mean it's wrong, believe it or not.
---
You're stating things as if they're universally true when they're pretty obviously based on your limited personal experience. You know that's dumb, right? 
---
Wow, I wonder if certain abilities reduce the chances of certain items dropped. The thought never occurred to me until I just read this post.
---
Sharding is to ease login servers. 500 people all trying to log in at the one place (elwyn forest for example) .
---
Can you define how it's spam? 
---
Yeah, it’s actually funny how little this is talked about, most players back the. We’re terrible by today’s standards. 
---
Significantly more people are going to raid and clear higher end content than in original vanilla 
---
Is this what we are doing now? explaining icons??
---
Flies like shiny things duh
---
I do not see how this has anything to do with login servers but ok.
---
Yeah that’s an easy fix, just don’t allow cross faction right click add friend. Blizzard are more than capable of sorting something like that out 
---
You're literally ignoring all the negatives and acting like that somehow fixes them.
---
Also, most of what you said about Vanilla is false.
---
There are already 5 other threads in the last week about this damn topic. This makes 2 front pagers in that time frame alone.
---
It's spam because we don't need recurring topics on it just to say the same shit over and over again.
---
No, this is a rumor created by people who never played Vanilla. We had plenty of master loot mistakes and GMs refused to fix all of them.
---
I didn't click, I didn't keyboard turn, my Internet just suuucked. Classic is my attempt at redemption. 
---
Why are you assuming the boar is 4 feet long? Maybe the boar is 8 feet long, and humans on azeroth are 11-12' tall.
---
Great observation
---
That makes sense, I hadn't seen the. 
---
The average player wont even clear naxx so tall can chill with the idea that u will all have full t3
---
While many don't support cross-server PvP, including myself, it would solve the issue.
---
However, as a rank 11 PvPer back in the day (r11 is not r14 but still had to be no life) I can tell you this:
---
We all knew each other in the high end PvP scene, and regularly recognized opponents.
---
Literally the day that cross server PvP was implemented, I never saw someone I recognized again. It was dead in an instant.
---
No longer was there the experience of seeing your arch enemy out in the open world, or developing recognition of particularly good players.
---
&gt;Blizzard are more than capable of sorting something like that out
---
I see you're an optimist.
---
Always thought it was some sort of Auroras, like the Northern Lights.
---
The consensus is that everyone want small things changed in vanilla, but it's not the same things, and a seeing a change made you do not want, is more frustrating than getting a chance done is satisfying, thus the simpliest and best way of doing classic is keeping it as blizzlike as possible.
---
Unfortunately, that's not the case. But they did say it was something they will "think about."
---
As it stands at this moment, there is full bnet integration just like retail WoW.
---
Why did you link the pic that is literally the topic. 
---
These are retail plebs that are use to auto win dungeons and raids.
---
Can’t wait to go home
---
My old guild master on \[private server\]. Great guy with awesome personality, but his gameplay...
---
It's an interesting idea, but synergistically, Rend and Sunder do nothing for eachother, as has been stated since it ignores armour. It's still possible and there's nothing to stop you from doing it but you may just as well spend that rage on straight damage.
---
You're right about rend though, which I'd like to defend a bit here. It's not a great skill but at low levels it's probably the most efficient output of damage a warrior has, because there's simply nothing else before midgame, everything else is garbage. This changes around level 30-40, of course. Improved Rend is absolutely worth it at that level, each point 1/3 provides between .8 and about 1.1% percent your average mob's life at that level over the course of a full DoT, provided you keep the spell trained regularly. That puts it on par with the 1/5% extra crit per point available of the first tier of fury in terms of damage, seeing as crit doesn't gain real value until it syncs with talents later on in the fury and arms trees.
---
This leads me to my next (slightly tangent-y) point, which is I simply can't understand why people tell warriors to level as fury before 30. You're asking them to go 30 levels with their only real damage boosting talent being 5% crit. The boosts from UW and imp. BShout are so minimal they're not even worth mentioning. It only starts getting good at 30 at properly good by 40. Meanwhile arms has very solid talents the whole way through. If you really want to play fury, respec it at 30-35. The gold you spend on respec you will save on leveling speed.
---
Back to the original talk about your build. If you're that keen to go a weird experimental build, have you thought about adapting this build for group play? You could even go sword and board prot and go for a full sunder/stun machine with improved revenge, essentially providing maximum support to your team in the form of stuns, damage boosts and interrupts. Also very useful in group pvp.
---
I tanked through ICC in wrath using keyboards for like 1-6 and clicking almost everything else.
---
I also became a hunter class officer in a raiding guild through SSC/TK during BC doing the same thing. Idk why you people think that its impossible to click things and be halfway decent. 
---
Played in Vanilla on a warrior the same way, but besides reaching lieutenant commander, that was my least successful expansion I played, by far.
---
Can't wait to do full length dungeon runs again. Dungeon finder watered down all the instances and people forgot there was always more bosses.
---
I can't find the Nobbel87 video that explains this part of warcraft lore in more detail.
---
Unfortunately no. It's actually kind of weird that the Ironforge inn is a more compact layout than the one shown in this picture. You'd think a city would have a bigger inn than a town, not the other way around.
---
yeah, it looked like it was not finished, and you probably would get the real reward on a stage that never was implemented. 
---
yes. he meant blues i guess. these are the two lowest epic items in vanilla: 
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=870
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=873
---
No because I’ll just play AV as the sneak rogue
---
Lol same yo
---
Hey, yeah the pummelers have only 3 charges so after that they can be vendored or deleted
---
Immortal and Undying runs weren't that bad. We just had to kick our shitty rogue out of all the raids. Dude had Thorid'al and Twinblades of Azzinoth and had the situational awareness of a slug.
---
Visually, I always much preferred Rogue t1 over t2. Tier 1 had a real stylin' assassin vibe to it with the high collar, t2 just felt a bit generic to me, though I know a lot of people love it. I always thought it was a shame how quickly you replaced the t1 helm with the t2 off onyxia.
---
Blizzard absolutely should implement a deserter debuff and they probably will.
---
But the top level pve and pvp guilds will still do backroom deals on discord/slack no matter what you do. Thank god, honestly, the meta aspects of MMO's are what make them fun.
---
Aurora Borealis?
---
Go mow your way in M15+ and send me a video of it. Compare the hardest content available in BFA with the hardest content in Vanilla. Apple to Apple, not Banana to Apple. 
---
I could duo dungeons and solo part of them with my mage back in vanilla. I can't do the same with M+10, following your logic, Vanilla is easier than BFA. Right? And do not presume anything, I have went further in vanilla than 99% of this sub. 
---
There were 8+ million players playing back then though. PvPers are just such a small subsection of the game, I still feel like the hardcore PvPers can still be a pretty tight knit community in Classic WoW with cross-server queues.  
---
edit: I meant BOE Blues, sorry about that. Will edit accordingly.
---
One thing here is a unknown factor and that is if the effect from aftermath and pyroclams is per tick of hellfire or per cast. If its per tick it is quit potent, per cast it is rather meh.
---
Bats not dropping bat blood is kinda weird tho
---
Yeah but there's gonna be a lot o us like Momo. The thought that we could play 4-5 years slowly progressing through all the content with all the responsibilities we didn't have back in 2004 is awesome.
---
Spider legs man... half these spiders are bigger than I am. Maybe I damaged the front legs... but there's gotta be minimum 4 good legs per spider!
---

My main tank in tbc had only one arm and cleared SSC.. so there is that. 
---
I always thought it was a gauntlet touching the floor, like it's the guy that was resurrected getting up, and the blood was dripping down his arm to the floor
---
The lock can tank a mob woth his void and fear juggle as he normally would plus he can dot the druids mobs. Along with benefitting from hots whoch equal mana efficienty for the warlock due to imp LT. Thorns can be placed on the VW for better threat aswell.
---
  
---
Seems druid nicely adds to the lock and vice versa. However a warlock is less mobile than a druid that is the only issue that comes to my mind as of now.
---
* leaves dungeon run in shame.
---
Have you ever done a M+15? Trash don't need affixes to wreck your DPS if you get aggro. Vanilla dungeons are only challenging when you go in there in shit ass level 40-50 leveling green.  Once you get any decent epic gear, they are as easy as any heroic dungeons in BFA. On top of having no reason to go back doing them once you start raiding. 
---
Sorry, but you guys need to stop kidding yourself with the difficulty of vanilla. The only thing you need is a tank that knows how to pull, but this is the same for any M+ dungeons. 
---
The original skill test
---
Add it to the grind list.
---
Yeah. 
---
And I don't think there is a third. 
---
Is that true? granted it’s been a very long time since I ran Naxx in vanilla but I have to imagine 40 70s geared in 5 man blues should steamroll it. 
---
No but BfA is much worse at covering that fact up than Legion was. Bad enough that the average Retail player can see through the smokescreen now.
---
Well they are cutting costs to even make the game a possibility. In case you haven't followed the news lately, Blizzard is in dire straits and they are desperately trying to survive. 
---
&gt; The most common defense? Oops, I miss-clicked dude sorry I took your sword but it's not like a raid epic and i'm not a ninja!
---
The idea that this fixes anything is a complete fallacy though. 
---
Why? Because if a shitty person was going to ninja something with a bullshit excuse they will still ninja the same item with a different shitty excuse. 
---
This doesn’t improve the end result. Just obfuscates the problem further while introducing new methods for abuse. 
---
They are not desperately trying to survive 
---
It’s not even that it changes the group dynamic. 
---
There’s actually a further root to this problem. 
---
You want to know the issue with 95% of the things which ruined this game?
---
Treating the players like they weren’t adults or responsible to make their own decisions. 
---
Loot trading is one of the main ways the game treats people like children. 
---
What does this mean?
---
Am new, thx!
---
...but they are missing a bunch of other stuff like Gouge...
---
How do you identify players who needed on items they don't need to later trade to their friends?
---
Same, I live in Australia and the servers were American based. 300-400 long on the regular. 
---
Sounds like you actually played Vanilla and remember the loot issues. People come here with Private server experience and say there was never loot issues in Vanilla, LOL.
---
&gt;Oops, I miss-clicked dude sorry
---
This is the number one excuse. One thing I do remember is that warriors tend to do this much more than other classes. They know the group would need an hour to find a replacement and he can just start another group on his own, so nobody calls them out.
---
After 3? years, make servers that players can transfer to that update to TBC.
---
If you don't want to you can stay on your vanilla server that doesn't update to TBC.
---
Nothing so far has mad me be anything else when it comes to blizzard.
---
From what I remember this was NOT allowed at any time. GMs would do this in raids but never in 5 mans. For a raid it require screen shots of the loot, the boss dead, and mis-click master loot required them talking with the raid leader IIRC.
---
ur wronfg
---
Local business taxes....
---
You realize this armor is from vanilla right?
---
Yeah, it fucking sucks aye. I miss old rogues.
---
Does't the game use yards to measure the range of spells that those humans are casting? If they were that small, yards would be much longer than they actually are in game.
---
The last time I logged in I found 3 alliance PvP rankers surrounded by 10+ horde corpses in the giants’ gorge. There is always something going on in Winterspring! 
---
The list feels really off most of the people ive talked about this topic so far all really loved winterspring and most of them agreed with me on darkshore being one of the worst zones. Desolace also seemed to be a tad lower than where its placed on here.
---
I'm glad they are implementing loot trading, I can ninja lot whenever I want with my friends and never get caught because we will be rolling on gear we need anyways, but in fact we will be rolling for each other :) atleast shitters don't get loot, am I right?
---
Did you actually read what I wrote? 
---
I did not complain about the difficulty itself but the way it is made difficult. You run through the dungeon clusterfucking everything. 
---
Even in AQ40 gear  you will be hardpressed taking on more than 5elites without a sheep and such, because the tank wont be able to keep all under control. 
---
When you see the full clusterfuck that nowadays dungeons are, I just quit and play D3 or Path of Exile where such a dungeon crawler way of dungeon layouts belong 
---
Look at this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZWybBLMXBs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZWybBLMXBs)
---
Pull everything together and AoE it all down. Does this look like a good MMORPG to you?
---
Durotar is one of the best designed zones in terms of actual game design. Stilistically it might be a tad boring from time to time but every content is so well put and woven one into another to this day it feels like the best starting zone to play even though tirisfal has a better atmosphere and immersion.
---
You assume whatever tank you have can hold aggro on X mobs at a time and nothing hits the locks that are already taking a ton of damage from Hellfire. Pally is the only tank that has ANY chance of holding aggro for a few seconds with that group.
---
Mage AOE is still superior with their CCs and survive-ability.
---
A really good point man. But as I keep saying this is all just gonna be a repeat of WoW. These people want to be babied. Just read the thread. There's no helping them. 
---
If you apply same fantasy logic, maybe blood is drained by spells like bleed, frozen or burned/evaporated by spells, pr whatever. Anything happens man, you are playing a damn fantasy mmorpg, shit doesn’t have to follow real life logic.
---
Thanks for the PM, I will definitively look into rolling there should blizzard keep fucking up.

No please... Classic is not about commodities. Loot trading is going to be harmful to the game.. If they dont want gm tickets then ok, you can take those away, but please no loot trade... 
---
Gotta be ready for that TBC Server.
---
Enjoy trying to progress through Classic's raid content via PuGs.
---
You might get away with ninja looting in SM and maybe even UBRS.
---
But that Dal'Rends set isn't going to get you very far.
---
The gear progression from vanilla to tbc wasnt as drastic as it has been for the recent expansions. You could use a good chunk of naxx gear throughout Kara. Even through mag and gruul. 5 man blues didn't destroy naxx. 
---
You're going to get instantly downvoted because this is a nearly daily thread that has been done to death.

Public service announcement
---
With loot trading we can get pre bis really fast rolling for each other, finding a raiding guild will be easy.
---
We were doing the same thing in our Living strat Orb farm. Hell, I could duo most dungeons and solo part of them once I hit AQ gear. What does that tell you? 
---
 
---
&gt; You assume whatever tank you have can hold aggro on X mobs at a time and nothing hits the locks that are already taking a ton of damage from Hellfire AND you have to be in melee range.
---
Aggro should be a nonissue if this works. Nothing should be hitting the locks if 3 of them have 36% stun chance per mob each. Only damage should be Hellfire, which is mostly mitigated by Holy Nova.
---
&gt;Pally is the only tank that has ANY chance of holding aggro for a few seconds with that group.
---
Pally has 0 chance because everything should be stunned. Stunned enemies don't hit the paladin. Don't hit the paladin, no threat generation.
---
It's totally true. In BC I was in an oldschool raid community that cleared MC, BWL, AQ... but Naxxramas? Couldn't finish it before Wrath moved it to Northrend.
---
I guess we were just bad and didn't have the coordination of a serious raiding guild, but also don't forget how the ratings, like hit, criticals, defense worked. A level 60 player fully equipped in pre-Naxxramas gear did more damage than a level 70 player in dungeon blues. The latter might not even be hit-capped!
---
One Beta Test please!
---
Same in Wrath actually, Naxxramas 25 got cleared in Sunwell gear.
---
DR might be an issue. Needs to be tested for sure. If it's per tick chance of stun, will they get 3 rounds of DR before the 1st stun ends, then?
---
Fuck...as I read this I am like fucking Westfall! And I’m like hmm that makes sense...
---
i had a fully decked 39 priest and was a god, soj and basically bis everywhere. the smite/holy fire build was more powerful than the pure shadow imo and you could heal teamates so well. a twinked power word shield alone is more hp than most ppl can deal with before they are dead and you could just spam it on everyone at flags etc. smites could 2 shot anyone.
---
You could be right but as of right now I trust the people making these decisions. 
---
I suspect they might flip and go the hardcore “no trading ever” route. But we will see....
---
That dungeons are static and they are not easy when you all farm preBiS and later on you breeze through.
---
there is no carrot on a stick artifically increasing difficulty.
---
My maingripe with Elder Scrolls Oblivion was that it scaled the outside world with your level, so you could never go back and barrel roll through some area, because the muskrat magically become lvl 50 as well. 
---
Classic will be a lot more like an actual RPG like the Witcher or Skyrim, while todays WoW is more along the lines of Path of Exile or Diablo3. An action RPG with a storyline and RP elements tagged onto it in cutscenes, so you dont feel entirely taken out of the world.
---
For me personally the RP element has to play an important part in dungeon and world layout and not someting that you have tell in video sequences.
---
This is the exact definition of slippery slope fallacy. You saying it's not doesn't change it. Just because it 'happened once' in a game that was expected to evolve and change doesn't mean it will happen in a game that's expected to never change. Yes patch 1.12 is considered the best but that doesn't mean a small mechanic could have been added in Wrath that was considered great and that single thing could be pulled down.
---
I'm not arguing for or against loot trading. I'm arguing against all you people that say "view with skepticism" and "be wary" which implies you can be swayed but your stubbornly rooted in either elitist purism or popular hivemind. "The community" can't decide on things because it's not a person or unanimous counsel.  
---
This intrigued me. This same type of theory crafting is discussed in the classic wow discord as well. You should check it out.

So here's this, my cousin was adamant about playing enhance only. We were in a really solid guild and he became fairly geared. He was always welcomed to join - however, our MT would sometimes throw on a two hander when we had 35+ in mc and always in zg. And still he would tank. So although on the lower teirs we would goof around a bit, we also always had no problem clearing that content.  If we only had 20-25 online on mc day we would just tryhard it and could clear it fairly easy anyway. Point being initially in a progression guild, nobody will be wanting an enhance shammy. However, if the raid is made up of 32 people and they are under geared, have been lfm for awhile, raid leaders get desperate to fill the empty so long as core components are there. After all, who really cares who the 23rd dps is if you risk losing a tank after waiting an hour and a half trying to find that perfect unattainable match. 
---
 Long story short, always ask to dps, but be ready to heal.
---
Just so you know last 1/4 of 2017 ActiBlizz announced turnover of $2.6 BILLION, so even if they had LESS sales last year they still had a turnover $10 Billion, hardly struggling to survive.  I know you are going to say, turnover isnt profit but please tell me what % of a sub is to cover costs, because regardless of game well over half is profit
---
Trusting Blizzard is never a good idea my friend. 
---
Surprising I have too and it was pretty obvious what it was. I guess maybe depends on what you focus on? I wonder what causes the human brain to misinterpret an image and accept that interpretation until it’s pointed out by someone else? For example, one icon that took me a long time to figure out was the white dog face. I couldn’t tell it was a nose so I thought it was like a ghost or something...
---
Side note, on pvp days... Can't tell you how much fun it was to watch him cap an ab flag by mounting up to unsuspecting slews and slapping them to their ass with his wf proc earthshaker.
---
ummm hypothetical???  If people can PROVE its open to abuse and explain why its not a hypothesis its a fact
---
enjoy dicksucking blizzard and all but im going to be loling when you start whining a year from now 
---
We failed Undying once because one of the tanks was in unholy presence and I was bis so the boss ran after me. The leader was yelling at me "how about you do less dps". u wot m8?
---
Yeah, every one of these "revelations" about an icon has just had me thinking, "Well duh, it's quite obviously that."
---
honestly mobs shouldnt last long enough to get 4 sunders up, its slow leveling but not that slow, just go fury and use a 2h. 
---
&gt;Go mow your way in M15+ and send me a video of it.
---
LMFAO imagine thinking M15+ is hard. Bet you also believe normal raids are impossible.
---
&gt;Compare the hardest content available in BFA with the hardest content in Vanilla.
---
Why the fuck would I compare content from 2004 to 2018? Are you even reading what you type? Obviously the difficulty is going to be different. 
---
My point was you needed to CC in dungeons or you're going to die. You don't have to CC these days, not even in M15. Can you not grasp this simple concept?
---
&gt;I could duo dungeons and solo part of them with my mage back in vanilla. I can't do the same with M+10, following your logic, Vanilla is easier than BFA. Right? And do not presume anything, I have went further in vanilla than 99% of this sub. 
---
Read what I said again and link me your armory. 
---
Sure it is, classic is not out and not one of those situations has happened. Until they do, it is hypothetical.
---
No.  Because since their 5-man is undergeared, half of them can't clear the nerfed, nerfed, nerfed-to-hell instances.
---
And you won't pull your weight and/or help your 5-man,  but hey, you'll be fine.
---
Yeah, let's hope you roll a healer and find out what it's like to have an undergeared, squishy tank -- the ONLY tank available at that time -- and all the bosses can one-shot him.  Oh wait, this isn't real Vanilla WoW, this is 1.12.
---
You're still gonna wipe.  I'll smile.
---
I think it's ment yo be both
---
Didja ever notice that those who can spout off ALL the BiS gear can never actually play their class?  
---
I don’t trust Blizzard. 
---
I trust the people making this. 
---
If you're trying to level very fast, trying to farm it at 30 is already off the table. Trying to get it with 2 other warriors can take an entire day.
---
I honestly think skipping it until 40 and trying to get a decent wep along the way (Ravager etc) is a good idea for those speed levelers
---
Shouldn't there be one in Dun Modr too? I mean, it would be overrun with Elites but when did that stop anyone?
---
And remember, cloth gear didn't drop as often in Naxx, especially for healers and dps.  We had rogues, shammies, warriors, hunters, all geared -- but when a 'cloth' dropped, it was like it was legendary.  And god forbid if you pug'd a Naxx -- you had other sham healers rolling on cloth as well for their healing set.  It was ridiculous.
---
Eh, more competition for space. See: real cities
---
Dude, you are in for a shock when everyone runs around for their BIS once they hit 60 and rush through every dungeons just like Retail, and stop doing them once they have the gear they need. 
---
The carrot on a stick you are talking about is to make dungeons content still relevant later during an expac, and there is nothing wrong about it. 
---
The RP element you are talking about was the noobs from 2005 who didn't know a thing about the game and sucked at it. 
---
Anyway, I'll have my popcorn ready for the hundreds of post we will see once retail comes out and people complain about "random loot", "farming for gold", and easy as hell content.  
---
Bye?
---
My favorite was the glass of milk on the zombie murlocs.
---
i wouldn't say speed leveling but like maybe top 20% for the first week or two. Im just curious what is usually done on fresh servers when you dont have anyone to carry you for the axe, a lot of the mobs are lvl 38/39 so you automatically cant really get it till way past 30 and the AH for crests isn't an option either.
---
I'll be healing that 5 man, and they'll be fine too. Thanks.
---
I've watched that streamer.  Man, you have to be lit to enjoy it.  
---
Could you explain why you think retail is better?
---
T6 wants a word 
---
Or fireballs boiling it
---
Buy the crests. Farm the rest. Have a higher friend kill cyclonian 
---
Blood of some lions is not pure enough, or you just failed to collect it and spilled too much of it. Lots of explanations that can work.
---
I bet you play Alliance
---
Quitters... 
---
Blizz is implementing loot trading because players lodged a lot of GM tickets, asking to transfer items to other players, and it costs them a lot in staff hours. It’s not about having more/less ninja-looting.
---
I agree with this. 
---
I’m sure that’s the motivation but the most popular comment in a thread at the top of the sub right now is stating that trading fixes the ninja loot “problem”. 
---
If it's a matter of staff hours, just leave the old system in place and don't allow any transfers. 
---
Dude. You have more screens from back then? I see old guildies on your wall of hate, but can't find any of our banter. I know you have it, used to be on the website. Drentyn (60 alli rogue)/Amsh/Mrmn/Trollop/Shtankeh and others I don't even remember on Dethecus. Was in Cruentus/Finding Emo.   
---
(Baykwan and Vaela among like 20 alts of other members are in your screens).  
---
I was with the group that made Thrin meltdown and jack our bank of Rag stuff. Found tons of my stuff from ganking in M3G4 on Eve Online for the time, but not much for this. Dethecus was the greatest shithole of all time. I miss it. Now we just have fakebuk as a shithole.
---
Don't forget the Frostsaber
---
Prepare to see it discussed 500x more times until we get actual updates from the devs.
---
Just for the lols, I'll link you my current account armory. No this is not my vanilla account if this is what you are looking for, it was banned a long time ago.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/mugthol/Antarys
---
Sorry, but Vanilla dungeons are easy and there is nothing you can do about it. And people do CC in 10+. Saying there is no CC just mean that you have no clue how M+10 works. 
---
I'll have my popcorn ready once classic is released. 
---
Personally, I would be fine if they simply didn't do GM tickets either. You fucked up, you live with your mistake. No loot trading necessary.
---
I ran it in BC plenty of times. We would do it but you would need at least 20 raid geared 70s and when we got to horsemen it was imperative to be in vent. It really was that hard haha. 
---
Aftermath is a 10% chance to daze, not stun. Additionally, diminishing returns is going to quickly make the stub non-existent. That’s gonna be a lot of strain on the healer to keep the tank AND three hellfiring warlocks alive once the stuns stop.
---
I believe they'll have grouping enabled below level 60. 
---
Lots of people like The Room, but that doesn't mean its a good quality film. 
---
I've never played Retail. This was my first time playing WoW. I do have alot of time played in GW2 though.
---
Oh and I probably am friends still with a few of the people in screens. I know the whole CHODE rage was our tank Svart on an alt. and OutbackJack was a kid brother of another member. Still friends with Hesh (TEAM ROUGE spelt right) Zephyir, Wumpus, Therinne, Waffleman, Wyrm, Cable (Vaela), Grantaron, Massive (Codylol), Lathan.  
---
Hell probably 10 people on the wall. If I start thinking alts. lmfao. Oh memories.
---
Ill bite
---
I havent played BfA but I played Legion and most of the quest were go here and kill x things. Or deliver this to said place which would follow up with kill x things. The quest where you use a vehicle are horrible. When playing a game I want to play my character that Ive been working on.
---
Main thing about vanilla is you actually have to try and level. Retail you can sit in a city and do nothing but lfg and pvp and level. Or if thats still to much work for you just boost your character. They spoon feed you all the way. 
---
Get bored with questing? Take a break and work on professions, pvp or run some dungeons (they take longer than an hour though). Dont want to do any of that then just go explore shit or gank people. Vanilla you have to create your own fun because they didnt hold your hand the entire way. 
---
And if you are playing for a good story Im not sure WoW is the best game for that anyway. Especially if all you know of the Warcraft lore is WoW (thats all I know so the story dosnt attract me as much)
---
Dont get me wrong, if you feel that way please dont play classic. Opinions like contributed to ruining the game anyway. Play Starwars, runescape, BfA, other mmos I cant think of. Or if you want a good story play a solo player game.
---
Naxx was kinda the destroyer of a lot of the community on the server.  If you were in a raiding guild attempting Naxx, man, you worked your ass off just for repair money, flasks, pots, etc.  There were so many attempts that you had no 'spare time' to play with friends in other guilds -- you had to commit to Naxx and farming, with maybe some weekend PVP to let off steam.
---
For me, it was almost like a full-time job.  Knowing that others had other family or work commitments, I tried to help out with making sure there was more than enough Black Lotus for their needed flasks, made sure that bandages and pots were available as well.
---
But I noticed that those running ZG, AQ20, etc. started to die out; and a shit-ton of applications were coming into our guild because they wanted to see Naxx.
---
Two of them, I know for a fact, had their characters leveled by Chinese farmers while they sat and watched TV.  But they wanted to see Naxx, and sweet talked some of the heavy PVP'ers.  They lasted exactly three bosses in Naxx until they were replaced in the run.
---
That was when the communities in WoW were torn apart -- "new server!" and it was also when transfers started so that better players could play with better players and 'guild openings' for tanks, rogues, etc. started happening.
---
It divided the server, Naxx did.  Many transferred off in hopes of finding a 'good guild' -- many transferred over in hopes of completing Naxx, and bringing along their gear that was earned with another guild.
---
While Naxx, like the original dungeons in Wow, was hard as hell, and you truly had to work at them -- it also destroyed servers.  But man, when you got a boss down -- your guild solidified into confidence.  Except for the bosses with 'gear checks' -- Naxx was worth it.  
---
Naxx wasn't a 'fun' raid like ZG, ZA and/or AQ20.  
---
What About in Lineage II does ganking HOT1881 and HOT1886 until HOT1880-1999 are chasing you across the map as you try to unflag from pk count?   
---
Otherwise. Meh. Played full time on Dethecus server. Wut u do?
---
One thing that everyone who likes games "for the story" should realize at some point in their lives is that most of the time those stories are extremely poorly done and not worth the time or effort.
---
Rend is awful. Sorry but you don't need to sunder mobs for levelling. Charge, hamstring, melee and lite in between auto attacks. Spam heroic strike.
---
Do you think GW2 had a good story?
---
Did DR exist on monsters in Vanilla? I would swear it didn't.
---
Indeed, makes sense.
---
Wait, WHAT?  The infamous Wailing Caverns is 4 bosses now?  WTF!?
---
You aren't indicative of the majority of players. Just like in vanilla, people like you existed. Just like on pservers, people like you exist. Content still gets cleared ridiculously fast by a very large population. 
---
yikes that account though lol
---
Those who do CC in 10+ are garbage to begin with. We're talking normal dungeons. If Vanilla had 10+ I am sure that'd be difficult too.
---
Or they can just don't transfer items and make it clear?
---
Yeah if you put in an hour a day, which is a lot sometimes with a full schedule it will take your around 5-6 months depending on your leveling speed. Might be quicker with all the rested xp you’d have tho. 
---
It didn’t early on but does in 1.12
---
Don’t we all, in my opinion it’s the magic that was lost in the name of accessibility for casual subscribers.
---
Most of the threads are.
---
What should I play?
---
What server?
---
sharding!!
---
Loot trade!!
---
Changes!!
---
No changes!!
---
Really at this point its only the occasional video post I like or the story ones.
---
Most movies suck but doesn't it make it that much better when one like spiderverse comes along? Same thing with games imo. Also I'm not saying wow doesn't have an amazing story, I am saying it has no story whatsoever and also it has one quest that you do on repeat. 
---
The person you were pvping was probably too busy laughing his ass off to dps you, so you just thought it was a potent defense
---
Definitely want the druid so you can remove curses.
---
I think long-term, #somechanges should be implemented on a small scale.  However I think you HAVE HAVE HAVE to remain extremely true to the original, 1.12 balance.  Minor, minor changes are what I have in mind like tweaking spell power coefficients, making PVP trinket break all 'loss of control or slow' effects (rather than individualized effects dependent on class), or VERY slightly nerfing or buffing certain abilities.  
---
Certain classes, like a ret paladin, are QUITE strong if you somehow acquire BIS gear.  Like any class I guess.  But if you give a BIS Ret paladin something like Crusader strike (100 percent weap damage, 15 sec cd, and re-buffs seal duration for example) that would be grossly overpowered.  For a regular leveling paladin or typical level 60 it wouldn't be a big deal but it wouldn't be a fair change.  
---
Your idea is interesting.  Rather than applying a debuff to the target, the shaman themselves receives an additional buff "20% bonus spell crit chance on next cast" or whatever, reduced mana cost you also mention.  A nerf to mana cost would also help a great deal in PVE while being kind of a non-issue in PVP, where Enh shaman are plenty strong enough already. 
---
I don't know the specifics, but OSRS does a system where basically, a change can be made but something like 75% of the community have to vote on it and there is some kind of drawn-out process so nothing is rushed and they have consensus.  I think a process like that could help WOW Classic make very gradual, small types of changes that give minor buffs to the so called "meme specs" to make them, at the bare minimum, viable options at certain points of the game.  
---
Like.. give a prot paladin a 5 minute CD taunt.  Poor guys.  
---
I have not played seriously since Mists but my personal favorite controversy is the flying mounts in WoD. 
---
They designed the game around not having flying mounts which was a correct decision. 
---
But because they couldn’t design the rest of the game properly they were losing players. 
---
The players who care more about being treated like children used this as an opportunity to bitch and whine about how not having flying mounts let them to cancel. So blizzard added it back in and lost a bunch of subs anyway. 
---
Just don’t jerk it while playing. That will for sure ruin it :) can’t be distracted while grinding. 
---
lol same shit brotha
---
Good would be a stretch but at least it has one. 
---
Actually a quick personal break every few hours can be good for the confidence and morale.
---
yet this is the most upvoted post haha, says a lot about this subreddit
---
i feel bad because these people are going to be fucking devastated if Blizzard does some Blizzard shit and fucks up Classic WoW
---
they wont be expecting it
---
If everything's stunned... nobody can cast curses.
---
If they get 1.5 rounds of stuns cause DR... the group's gotta stay alive for 3-4 more seconds.
---
"these boar asses smell... roasted. did you... did you use fucking pyroblast?!"
---
They took away Gouge?  WTF
---
You sure are not making any sense. Sure, don't CC anything because you are that "awesome" or waste your time since you could have just CCed the spawn of G'huun and kill a group much faster. Clearly, all of retail population is running 10+ and breeze through them within timers. Right? Because they are that easy! Now let's talk about Vanilla dungeons that you could DUO and solo certain parts of them. 
---
Since you have seen my account that was hardly played until BFA, I sure hope you are going to post yours so I can laugh too?
---
&gt; Have a higher friend kill cyclonian
---
That's OP's problem. There won't really be higher friends at launch.
---
'Outlaw' AKA Yahtzee Pirate still has it, but neither Subtlety nor Assassination.
---
Now, I can remember learning Gouge at level 6 back in 2004, and I'd had it keybound  at '4' for, oh, thirteen or fourteen years? Then simply, poof, gone.
---
Honestly, shame on the entire class design team, from the very bottom of my sneaky Rogue heart.
---
then I say let them blow their wad and move on while we're still stroking
---
Wha-......*how* do you get wings out of this? Or even a fucking hawk? Whatttttt
---
Seriously this one is such a no-brainer lol
---
Um hum, and when you get to Strath's tunnel and you keep running out of mana to heal them through the poisons, you can give me a call.  I'll be about level 58 and able to heal through that mess.  But you do hurry, your groups will enjoy your cries of "OOM!" and making them wait for you to drink. DM water won't be available.  Oh the joy.
---
&gt; night elf druid
---
plus from me
---
You really said it yourself. The appeal is, in my opinion, the actual challenge in gameplay. Most games nowadays are a themepark ride designes to keep your mind hooked for just long enoigh, all the dificulty is just artificial, seriously, try to die in aodern game and you'll realize its harder than surviving. 
---
This game was made in a time before this mindset where difficulty was strategically placed and felt real. The actual danger makes it feel immersive.
---
Thats what it is for me anyway. 
---
Well, that's a matter of approach then. I'd rather have "no story" (which just means no overarching story - there are plenty of smaller stories all over Azeroth) than my character being railroaded into being *the Commander*, sent to run around a vast desert to ask random people if they know about "something that helps bring down the god of war" and haunted by shitty characters like Rox, Braham and Taimi for the rest of his existence. Vanilla was more about worldbuilding and filling the gaps with one's own creativity.
---
Hi, Activision.
---
Make friends with a couple of hunters and get them to help you farm the stuff. Hunters can handle mobs much higher than themselves.
---
If he is playing a warrior there will be higher people by the time he is 30
---
Now you're comparing raids to Vanilla dungeons. What are you even saying lmfao. I'll copy paste what I wrote earlier:
---
"We're talking normal dungeons. If Vanilla had 10+ I am sure that'd be difficult than normal dungeons too."
---
Imagine not having reading comprehension skills.
---
^This is the correct answer.  I didn't even realize blizzard would do something like that.  It's just stupid to waste GM time on players screw-ups.
---
Dude. Calm down. You do you. Quit complaining that other people are playing differently.
---
Oh dude, don't take offense when people point out the shortcomings to your plan.  Your response tells me the nail was hit directly on the head.  
---
Nah.
---
There already is a shitshow. 
---
Paladins played *completely differently* during Molten Core because they didn’t get their huge revamp until 1.9 Gates of AQ patch. 
---
Rogues got their huge revamp literally for 1.12, which means most Rogue players during Vanilla aren’t even playing the version of Rogues they most likely played for three years!
---
Your right of course, it is a matter of approach. I do like having an overarching story and a solid cast of characters. that way you can go a layer deeper on the lore sometimes; Like how does Rytlok have  Sohothin? how o.O
---
after 200 hours in WoW I litterally do not know the name of a single npc. A different type of game for a different type of gamer I guess. Not better or worse, just different. 
---
Raids? wtf are you talking about with your raids? You never did any 10+ in BFA did you? 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/affix=16/infested
---
Just looked at your post history, you are a complete moron. Let me guess, you never made it to 60 back in vanilla and you think you know everything? Lmao hero. Stop please. 
---
So you made it to 42 and are done? Is that your first character?
---
I've never cared about speed running, but mass melee with a wf bot does sound ridiculously fun
---
As a warrior, I don’t have the int gear for measuring blood spilled.
---
Can I see?
---
Most important if you ever want to raid as enhancement, learn totem twisting. After that get nightfall, then as close to 25% crit as possible. One unlucky person will have to raid whit nightfall, hunters do it best but it is harder to convince them to stand in mele and spam wing clip so it might aswell be you. And remember you probably have the worst raid gear table in the game and you can only use earth shock and white attacks. 
---
Thanks for the comment. You could very well be right about my talent points and rend. The overall strat doesn't depend on the build much so standard fury or arms might still be the thing to do.
---
I've been experimenting with it ever since I saw that Swifty starts all his PvP fights with four or five sunders. Can't say I can tell much of a speed difference, but before I tried it I would've sworn up and down Sunder did nothing, but paying attention to the numbers I'd say it doesn't seem slower and the damage increase after a few sunders on cloth or leather wearing npcs is pretty damn compelling.
---
I used to work in customer service. Saying no to paying customers is difficult, since the customer gets to rate your answer at the end. Your livelihood depends on it.
---
It sucks. If they give GMs the ability to turn down players requesting loot transfers, there would always be some GMs who would do it and bend the rules a little for the gold ratings. Their managers won’t bat an eyelid if it brings in the good ratings. Happens in every call center.
---
&gt; that way you can go a layer deeper on the lore sometimes; Like how does Rytlok have Sohothin? how o.O
---
How did the the Plaguelands become overrun by Undead? What's that Portal in the Blasted Lands? How did Orgrimmar get founded? Why are there Orcs in Kalimdor, but also in the Blackrock Mountain? In WoW, the characters are the areas, the cultures, the structures, and all of these questions for example can be answered by the previous games, which could be described as deeper layers. They also have actual protagonists.
---
Yeah I'm not sure why so may people expect more than 2\~ years.  Like if you want more than 2 years you are in the extreme minority.  
---
Nah what people forget is that you always want to come back and do it again after a bit. You hear these two words, "fresh server",  and suddenly the drive to do it all again comes back. Been on the wild ride a few times with private servers and man nothing like a few months later after Naxx has killed your old server to "new fresh server".
---
Might be because fresh vanilla is kinda fun in terms of every aspect of the game, you get to experience a fresh world with everyone starting from lv 1. You start playing the game a little differently each time, maybe you might optimize more this time round but the point is that it's the same adventure but nothing is ever the same each time round.
---
Lol that's pretty funny, I just thought not ten minutes ago. "Maybe points in parry would be the best option."
---
Nah, no numbers yet. I was considering doing a 50 mob grind both ways and checking which had the overall better time, but that seems like it'd be very level dependent anyways so it might not be worth it.
---
Very good point about overpower. Makes the Arms build look better and better.
---
Yeah it is. I wanted to try out WoW and now I have done. Honestly it's pretty good, I can see why it's so popular. But it definitely is not for me. There is no way I'd be willing to go through another 200 hours of just grinding out mobs which is all the game has you do as far as I can see. 
---
Yeah that's a great point, demo shout always saves my ass when I pull two mobs. Never really thought to use it on every enemy though...
---
Yeah I see what you mean.  For me personally there is no incentive that will make me play Retail... but that’s just me.
---
I've never tried it on a fresh server, so I'm only speculating, here. That said, having a friend playing a class that can heal should be enough to help with the farming part (even the lvl 39 elementals) all in the early 30s. Just probably a bit slow.
---
Though I could see the healer just pulling aggro on Cyclonian due to the warrior's inability to land many hits. You probably would need two healers to handle it.
---
The real challenge would be talking someone who could be out leveling to spend a couple hours helping you with this . .
---
PSA: You don't actually have to jump to make it across this gap.  You can auto-run straight across and the difference in height will allow you to clear the gap.
---
Mage and anyone that can give me a good buff as a rogue 
---
Sunken Temple ho!
---
OwO
---
I still remember trying to navigate LBRS for the first time. That dungeon took like 4 hours it felt like, in retail not even one.
---
It’s hard to rank the zones like this because they’re all AMAZING
---
Feral druids are probably the only hybrids (except warriors) that are a viable high end raiding. They get alot of really nice gear in aq. And you can always use a feral to tank things like hateful strikes.
---
It's per cast not tick. So u have 26% chance to stun them over 15 sec for 3 seconds.
---
We did Naxx for about a year steady and that rogue probably messed up at least 10 runs by himself. The Guild Leader's cousin also was a repeat offender on his mage and hunter. Our best Resto Shaman didn't get the achievement for months because of his poor luck being in raids with these guys. I can't count how many times one of those dudes died to Kel'Thuzad's Frost Blast.
---
Very true about the group play, those revenge procs happen constantly and Concussive blow is always fun. Even if the group was just rogue/warrior I'd hardly need healing with all the stuns.
---
I'll push back on the fury build thing just slightly because crit chance is really low when leveling, so 5/5 cruelty far better for crit than an entire set of greens with only agility. My only point in saying that is that white crits give good rage.
---
Agree. Had a PUG the first time I ever did WC with no dedicated tank because we didnt know better. We died so many times but cleared most of the bosses. It was so much fun and most of the party remained on my friends list throughout Vanilla WoW.
---
Funnily enough it's the exact opposite for me, the only one of many that I didn't know what it was
---
Pretty sure 90% of everyone could've cleared it if they tried in wrath though.
---
I'm just gonna take a stab in the dark.
---
1.How did the the Plaguelands become overrun by Undead? 
---
Well they are called the plaguelands so I would guess there was not much inhabiting it before the undead took it.
---
What's that Portal in the Blasted Lands? 
---
Relic of an old conflict?
---
How did Orgrimmar get founded? 
---
Some horde built a defensive perimeter around some land and it evolved from there.
---
Why are there Orcs in Kalimdor, but also in the Blackrock Mountain? 
---
Different clans?
---
everyone saying they thought it was an eagle, wings or an aurora and here I am thinking it was a leg+foot for someone being raised again to fight
---
r/iamverysmart
---
I feel like everyone talks like they tried it before even though they havn't this is my findings googling talents/speels etc. (I never tried it tho)
---
_______
---
First of all it's not 36% it's  26%. The 10% is Daze (slow) not stun. (He is talking about aftermath talent, google it)
---
The 26% is also WAY worse then what it sounds like. It's PER CAST not per tick. Per tick would be broken af since then as solo warlock u would have 26% chance to stun them every single sec for 3 sec. That not right. So instead u have 26% chance to stun them for 3 sec over 15 seconds.
---
This means every warlock has 45 seconds of this up. Every second we have 3 ticks. The chance for every tick hitting would be 26/15 = 1.73% chance to stun per tick. Since we have 3x warlocks (3 ticks per second) it's 1.73*3= 5.19 % chance to stun the target every second. But it stuns 3 seconds so it's *3 again =15.57%
---
So the mobs will ONLY be stunned 15.57% of the time during combats. This is not even that high tbh. and tbh since their is a chance the warlock stuns will be on top of eachother it's even lower. (13% of the time or so)
---
Now, this doesn't mean it's not viable, u just have to tweak it a bit.
---
We still have 3 warlock pets here that can tank 1 mob each pretty eaisly &amp; we also have "1 spot left" 
---
My suggestion would 100% be a mage since slows + frost nova + free drinks would help a group so much, also pulls would be even faster with some extra damage for a mage. Bosses should also still be possible with 3x warlock pets.
---
Mages can also sheep a mob if the pack is 4x mobs.
---
I'm pretty sure it would be fast/viable, but the stun part simply won't work.
---
Oh I did. Raided and had a lot of fun. Read my previous two posts. 
---
btw TBC was better but that doesn't matter. Classic will be more fun than this garbage expansion. Can't wait! Also can't wait to read Reddit this summer when people like have mental breakdowns after seeing the 10+ years old version of the game overtaking its successor in popularity LMFAO. 
---
Pretty sure they tried to replicate it with the t2 Bloodfang set, whith the other dagher being Core Hound Tooth. 
---
Wrath t2 Warrior set is what Sonya is using, with Ashkandi and Quel’serrar(?) some elven blade. She also has a DK skin, and a skin remake of Wrath, with no helm and using Arcanite Reaper, off my memory I can’t remember the other weapon she is using. 
---
IIRC Uther uses a pvp set, also 2 different Judgement t2 skins, one of them is more spiky and uses a Sulfuras look-alike. 
---
Balespider Gul’dan a set from Firelands exists too. Grand Marshall Varian super neat, and High Warlord Garrosh. There’s also a female orc version of Johanna. 
---
The redemption angel which gives you rez sickness is a skin for Auriel. Vanndar Muradin skin, and the Drek’thar skin for Rehgar. 
---
I probably missed a bunch but these are the ones I can remember clearly, and they are really well made! 
---
Well I think the raids and dungeons offer a lot more, playing with other people in a guild really makes the experience 
---
“Literally mimics”
---
So what you’re saying is that if you wanted a certain item a GM would join the group, roll on that item and then trade it to you in set of actions that is completely, unethical and unfair?
---
Yeah, that happened in classic WoW all the time.....
---
Woosh
---
So, this sounds great in theory but I seem to recall back in vanilla talents like aftermath had some oddities when calculating against channeled spells.
---
I seem to recall the chance to crit was divided among the entire cast , not each tick.
---
I’m not 100% , but this could be one of those things the private servers never got right.
---
I subbed for the month to see what it is like. Looking past problematic bugs, It's an ok game. But it really isn't a good MMO anymore. I hope they don't fuck up classic.
---
Was just talking about this with my buddies. Added more folks to my friend list in 1 week on pserver than I did in the last 10 years
---
Personally I feel there are plenty of stories and I find many of them quite interesting (and I am sure not alone in this). The story around VanCleef, Mor'ladim in Duskshire. Or the quest in Ashenvale regarding the creation of the Worgen. The story around Shadowfang Keep. The story around Hakkar The Soulflayer and the betrayal to bring him back into the world. And there's much,  much more … There are many of these smaller but still interesting stories scattered around the world.
---
There is indeed no overarching story in Classic WoW and personally I don't mind - I think it's a good thing for Classic. But if you want an overarching story, you can always wait for The Burning Crusade (lets hope Blizzard will release a Classic version in the future). And maybe WotLK as well.
---
I've never seen it that way before but if I had to guess I'd say top part of the arm in the birds right wing, the thumb is his head looking at you, and the fingers are his left wing.
---
Theldamar is literally the best example of #DwarfMasterRace
---
And those people will be busy leveling, good luck finding someone to go out of their way to come and help you.
---
Weird how I keep destroying Zhevra's hooves when I cut their hearts out. 
---
What even are friends 
---
For me it was the PVP. PVP in wow is like playing a twitch shooter now. Of I wanted to play call of duty or another GPS, I'd play that. I Mich prefer the strategic tactics one had to employ to stay alive in vanilla
---
Depends what you mean with toxic
---
Simple .
---
If you have 3 pure dps that are moderately competent , you can rush him.
---
That said , never ever rush him in PuGs, always kill adds.
---
Thanks for proving me how much of a jackass you are. You don't know shit about M+, do not provide any Armory, and talk out of your ass in all of your posts. 
---
I don't give a shit if you don't believe me, but let me tell you that I cleared 10/15 NAXX and know my shit about Vanilla more than your CC nonsense.  
---
Makes me wish there was a 'kill gently' option, but then that's a whole new can of worms that's maybe best left unopened.
---
I want to play this pserver too now. Mind sending me a PM with the name? Or is this not allowed here?
---
Well a huge appeal to WoW’s story for a lot of people is the lore that preceded it in WC3. It carries over in WoW and there are lot of things that you pick up on that stem from there so you really wouldn’t notice since you come from GW. if you’d like a good story, I’d highly recommend wows third expansion, wrath of the Lich king. It’s a tragic story and the questing and RPG elements are greatly improved from vanilla, and it also happened to be the peak of WoW when it had 12 million subscribers 
---
Personally I see little point in waiting with releasing content. As a software developer I feel it's probably easier to just do a single 1.12 release and keep it at that. I can kinda understand they want to gate the release of raids and that's acceptable to me, but any other content like class quests, might as well be in the game from the very start imo.
---
Most private servers die when aq has been out for a month or two and most guilds break up realising that aq40 is an absolute pain in the ass to raid. Naxx usually revitalises servers for a short while if anything.
---
No arrogance there, I've ran into many guides in my early levels and they sure helped a ton.
---
That wouldn't be mimicking
---
However checking that all players were eligible, in the time frame of eligibility and accurately relocating the item does mimic what a GM would have done.  
---
The items eligible for loot trading would have been eligible to be transferred by a GM with the same rule set in place.  The only difference is they automated this process instead of it being manually done.  
---
The shit was so easy in wrath when it was progression, everyone heavily overstates the difficulty of old-school raid mechanics. The real barrier is the gear people will need to run it. By the time I was  full t7.5 I could literally solo heigan as a prot pal lmao 
---
19 hunter is a blast to play! With those agi enchants you do stupid damage at range.
---
Wetlands 35 what???
---
I loved this zone.
---
I just farmed over 20g on a level 45 in just over an hour. it's considered low for a good reason.
---
&gt; I wanted to try out WoW and now I have done.
---
You've only tried out levelling.
---
They removed the jump on retail
---
5 L20s will have an easy time. Just make tanl get aggro on both adds then rush boss. The extra adds won't have time to ruin things before vc is dead.
---
By the time Naxx hits , you’ll find there’s a cultural block still in place due to the nature of the raised difficulty and attunement costs.
---
You won’t be invited to a progression guild as hybrid DPS, period because they are still inferior to their pure dps counterparts.
---
Due to Naxxs high attunement cost for individual players , the vast casual base will not be able to enter the instance. As such , casual Naxx raiding isnt really a thing.
---
So in summary, hybrids are still stuck to healing.
---
Only need one dude to call you out on it and screenshots are a thing that exists. Plus I'm pretty sure this would result in a ban on blizzard servers. 
---
&gt; Well they are called the plaguelands so I would guess there was not much inhabiting it before the undead took it.
---
No, the land previously was a human kingdom, but the Scourge first infected its citizens with the plague that turned them undead, and then mounted a full-scale attack/genocide and took over. The entire land is sick now, hence the plaguelands. That happened in Warcraft 3, where you play both the humans defending against the Scourge, as well as the Scourge itself.
---
&gt;What's that Portal in the Blasted Lands?
---
&gt;Relic of an old conflict?
---
It's the portal to the orcs' old homeland, which is an entirely different planet. In Warcraft 1 and 2, they came through this portal to attack Azeroth. They got beaten back, and an Alliance expedition followed them and closed the portal from the other side.
---
In TBC, that portal got reopened. That meant we got to see the ancestral homeland of the orcs, we got to reunite with the remnants of that expedition, and, well, we got to explore an entire, exotic, shattered planet. Exciting times, back then. The map from [Warcraft 2](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/wowpedia/b/be/Draenor_map.jpg) even largely resembles the [one in TBC](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/wowpedia/e/ec/WorldMap-Outland.jpg), despite a 9 year difference in the two games.
---
&gt;How did Orgrimmar get founded?
---
&gt;Some horde built a defensive perimeter around some land and it evolved from there.
---
The Horde, following its leader Thrall, was looking for a new homeland and settled down in Kalimdor. The entire story of the (new, playable) Horde, along with the founding of the capital city, is playable in Warcraft 3.
---
&gt;Why are there Orcs in Kalimdor, but also in the Blackrock Mountain?
---
&gt;Different clans?
---
Sure, but they all came through that portal in the same invasion. The difference being that the ones in Kalimdor believe in a fresh start, whereas the ones in Blackrock still want to conquer and/or kill everyone.
---
[Different game, same principle.](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/12/06/were-playing-asherons-call-2)
---
There’s not just a lot of toxicity , but also a distinct lack of knowledge of the actual culture that existed during vanilla.
---
The fact that anyone doesn’t understand why a deadlines run would be advertised as “LF1M DM” and not “LF1M VC” shows that.
---
This; don't forget that a huuuuge majority of wow's playerbase were young kids and probably a lot of them were new to PC gaming in general. 
---
The mechanics and strats (when they didn't bug) were NOT hard, we just remember them that way. 
---
You won’t be able to do this before low 40s if you plan to be among the first levelers , by that time there are easier replacements to be had so it’s not really worth the time if speed is the goal .
---
Whoa dude, *"you people"?* 
---
C'mon. 
---
&gt;I don't give a shit if you don't believe me, but let me tell you that I cleared 10/15 NAXX and know my shit about Vanilla more than your CC nonsense. 
---
If you say so. Was it on your "banned" account? LMFAO
---
People who are usually around your own level and can't boost you because you meet them while doing level relevant content. Also it'd have to be a very nice friend to boost you through all the shit required for whirlwind axe. I don't know if I would say yes if my online friend asked me to spend half an entire day killing grey mobs. 
---
I said friends. If you aren’t willing to help friends you aren’t much of a friend.
---
Excellent, I'll try it out :)
---
It's not a big deal if you lose aggro on a mob. They won't kill anyone unless you don't get the aggro back for like 10 seconds.
---
A good tactic is to mark a target with skull and let others focus it while you make sure you have threat on other targets and then taunt the skull back from the dps.
---
Done correctly nobody will know/be able to prove they're rolling for each other.
---
It shouldn't, not blizzlike
---
Nah. Usually good players know all of the BiS gear too. It's definitely true that not every person who knows all of the BiS gear is a good player though.
---
That's basically what i'm figuring as well.
---
I spent like 80g on fiery enchants because i wanted my green level 22 daggers to glow orange. 
---
i think the issue is whether its even worth it, 5 lvl 30's would take all day to get the mats and probably couldnt kill cyclonian so you already have to level past 30 a fair bit, then doing it still takes a long time even if your the right level. By that point you can get a differnt weapon easier.
---
Yeah, bad net, 15 year old kids and new gamers were all over wow.
---
Years ago, when this was a new and exciting complaint, I had the same thought. I kind of wanted to make a comic where a warrior with a huge mace carefully lines up his swing for several panels like he's a pro golfer, completely annihilates a murloc's head, and then bends over and says "why this murloc have no eyes lol blizzard". 
---
Actually you can’t as there ISNT a system in place yet. The game isn’t out and a method for doing this has not been established. 
---
Just because a past system was abused doesn’t mean there wouldn’t be changes made to address an obvious bad situation. They’ve addressed this at Blizzcon but I’m sure you’re just another guy who didn’t watch. 
---
Crashing servers 500 ms lag, level farming, gold farming, and exploitable bugs won’t be part of this experience. It’s part of the reason they are using current architecture. 
---
So what makes you think that obvious GM abuse would still happen. 
---
No right minded person with any sense of perspective would even think what you’re saying is correct. 
---
Sometimes is just fun to hand out and help your friends 😁
---
I just farted
---
But you also had problems on trash like gargoyles because people would try to herp derp dps them down rather than respecting the mechanics; at which point they go immune and heal up. Repeat 4-5 times because the rogues don't want to kick and ruin pumping up their dps metre and you get people hearthing out of the expected steamroll of old content.
---
30 troll tusks, lvl 33-34 mobs at the lowest, about 30% droprate, so 90 troll kills. 10 thundering charms from lvl 38-39 mobs, 25% droprate, 40 mob kills. Same for the other two charms. So we're at 210 mob kills so far. 
---
That's without taking into account the fact that you have to run all over the place to complete it, taking up even more time. 
---
If my friend asked me to go farm 200 mobs so he can get an axe, I'd tell him to go suck a dick. 
---
Either way, it's easier to ask your overleveled friend to boost you through SM at lvl 34 for Bonebiter, which is slightly better anyway, and takes way less time to complete. Whirlwind axe is only good if you get it at lvl 30 on an alt, where you can just throw gold at the problem. 
---
I'd rather do things that are fun for all parties involved and not just asking your friend to boost you through a pretty big grind for your own benefit, and only your own benefit. 
---
1.  Then it’s not “literallY” or “mimicking” as YOU stated. 
---
2.  As others have stated this rarely happened for epics in vanilla, and it was incredibly less likely for blues. So in that respect again you are misrepresenting vanilla WoW. 
---
3. There are no items “eligible” for loot trading at all back then. It was at the discretion of what I’m guessing were high level GMs which is why it was so rare. 
---
4. At at least one point in vanilla this option did NOT even exist. 
---
5.  The “rule set” you suggest was actually generally not the one used. Despite anecdotal evidence the GMs generally looked at these situations in a fair context. If they saw bullshit happening or a different player winning a role it was less likely to occur. 
---
So no, it’s not one difference it’s like 100. You have no clue what you are talking about. 
---
Yes, but there will also be a thriving community of positive and friendly people looking to meet people and go on adventures together.... to kill Hogger 
---
Well, I don't blame you, playing on a server full of Chinese gold sellers can be really frustrating, I got a 60 and a 38~40 on this server aswell and I quit at the beginning mainly because of that.
---
&gt; For example, in the 20s as Alliance you oscillate among Loch Modan, Westfall, and Redridge. In the 30s it's Duskwood, Wetlands, Dustwallow Marsh, and Hillsbrad
---
These aren't right. 
---
Not entirely true... I can imagine that more of the player base will see Naxx compared to original vanilla due to the amount of information available and everyone generally being better players. I don't think stepping foot inside Naxx will be anywhere as near hardcore as it used to be. 
---
That being said, some guilds may look to have a Shadow Priest and maybe even a feral. Those certain specs don't necessarily get a lot better with the release of new content / gear, but in the case of the Shadow Priest the Warlocks they're buffing scale hugely with Naxx items. 
---
Not every guild will have these spaces available, and if they are available expect the spaces to be highly contested. 
---
I played on gul’dan and it was always called VC back then.  I think it was one of the newer servers launched after dire maul came out
---
I've had mixed experiences. Some private servers with mostly great people, some with a higher percentage of asshats. 
---
I've also noticed that people making accusations of toxicity are often more toxic than others (not calling out OP by the way, even if it reads like it lol).
---
Disagree - it will be a big issue when it’s profitable to steal loot from other players.
---
“Legitimate loot trading issues” like misclicks can be fixed by not allowing any loot trading ever and saying “sorry be more careful next time.” This also doesn’t involve hiring any more GMs.
---
You won’t know if anyone is pulling shady loot shit - using this system, that’s the point. Again, you don’t even seem to understand the fundamental issues being discussed here, I recommend you read some of my other posts on this.
---
Comprehension skills problem? It does happen when you are a compulsive liar that can only talks shit. You know nothing about Vanilla, you know shit about BFA. Hilarious really. 
---
Again for my laugh,

Rocking that satellite internet back then.
---
Excellent strategy.  That way the party knows that was the plan all along.
---
Many progression nights eventually led "ok everyone, we know respeccing is expensive, but fuck your pvp/meme builds tonight"
---
Ion implied during Blizzcon that GMs used to trade items when a ticket was opened by both players. Anecdotally some people are saying yes it happened but plenty of others are saying the GMs refused or have it to the person in the group with the second highest roll. 
---
I think Ion is using this point to try to sell a feature he knew would be unpopular. In reality vanilla GMs were all over the place and it’s likely they did it for some and refused it for others.
---
it's hard to take anyone who uses "toxic" or "problematic" unironically seriously 
---
They may discover that it ends up being more profitable catering classic servers toward the casual retail player base after the initial classic launch is well past and people are invested with time sunk into Mc and bwl. I'm predicting slow bunch steady Activision like changes about a year after launch that will eventually ruin classic as well. Also, they will turn sharding off after the starting zone, but it will be reintroduced later due to whatever bullshit excuse they make up at that time. 
---
I had no idea.
---
Capital cities aren't even sharded on retail 
---
Please define "toxic player".
---
Wtf. There are tons of stories in the game, and on roleplay servers you get unique ones made by others and yourself.
---
I think I've had far more instances where something was won and another person asked nicely if they could have it cause they needed it and it was given to them than groups rolling for their friends.  Why does everyone assume everyone else are shitty human beings?
---
Imagine the rent in an Ironforge flat.
---
If you want 1k people in a starting zone that isn't vanilla either, you just want a private server. I am anti sharding but the hypocrisy it points out is valid. 
---
[Ravager](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7717/ravager) from SM as an alternative? though that requires lvl 37, so you're not that much ahead.
---
Kargoz did a [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HyCiVeKMS9MDOHxEHyDH38i0q2kJD-3qjSMxFjTZk8k/edit#slide=id.g4540852442_555_360) on warrior leveling weapons [(also a full video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM), if that's any help.
---
1/10 of 1% of retail vanilla players finished naxx.  I expect that percentage to be higher this time around - maybe 3/10s of 1%.  Original naxx was beyond hard mode.  It broke guilds, people had mental breakdowns.  It was both wonderful and horrific at the same time.  It you think you know it cause you went there in wrath, you're wrong. It was so evil, when they brought it live in wrath, they barely changed the damage numbers compared to vanilla. 
---
Small town monopoly that had no obligation to increase Internet speeds and I was a kid who had to take what he could get. Non-internet oriented parents who thought dial up was okay until 2005.
---
I’ve never played on a private server so I don’t want to make generalizations about the player base. What I will say though is that servers where people can play the game for free are probably more likely to attract bozos as they have no skin in the game and no real loss if their characters are deleted. People will be more civil when Papa Blizzard is over their shoulder with a ban hammer should they step out of line.
---
I had the luxury of online schooling. So I could play at night when my latency wasn't complete shit. Even at those hours it wasn't even close to good. So this is my redemption with high speed internet. I won't miss people whispering me about my lag dragging after they stun me lol 
---
It is. It's an Elune reference.
---
That gap
---
idiot
---
Seems like a viable level for balance. Or some weird spec that has a little bit of everything 
---
Eh? Seeing as how everyone has seen naxx mechanics at this point its only a matter of gear.
---
Blizzard, frost nova. Fear, poly, adds&gt;VC.
---
Rogue initiates pull with sap and SnD evasion kills one add solo. Warrior will clap to get threat on all others. Initiated killing.
---
Easy with competence.
---
Your comment would make sense unless they charge full subscription...
---
Gnome is a good choice for alliance. I have to agree that if you're doing both I'd start with mage. They are significantly better gold farmers and an easier leveling experience imo
---
1k people in starting zones isn't vanilla. Sharding isn't vanilla. Neither of them are vanilla, but one definitely hurts the game more than the other, and you know which one it is.
---
Both are shit for the game, proper server caps and queues a better alternative.

I've played a bit on private servers and didn't think they were toxic.  It reminded me of how things were in Vanilla and TBC.   A server was a real community and how you behaved had consequences.  You couldn't do anything without groups so being loot ninja or a whiner had real consequences.  If you were good people would friend you and invite you to things.  You needed to manage your reputation on the server.  If you had a janky spec, like lolret, or played bad expect people to tell you off and to have trouble getting groups.
---
A lot of the more successful guilds were run by adults and adults didn't really tolerate people acting like kids.  There was an expectation of maturity.  If the raid starts at 7:00 it's assumed you're logged on, at the instance, fully stocked up by 6:55.  If not expect a boot and probably a /gkick.  Unless you were a dwarf priest or a tank with a full set of fire resist gear.  Those people would get second chances.  If you were dps...forget about it.
---
I MISS those days.  It was loads of fun.  I doubt this second take will be quite as hard core or whatever but I suspect it'll come close.
---
Well yeah, sure. But these people still put in the effort to level up (which is enough reason for me to not want to be banned) and also, from my experience they live in the west, so i would think they're not THAT broke. Although not that i think about it they could just be kids... 
---
it was vc in '06
---
Didnt say problematic though
---
What do you mean by toxic? How many is alot?
---
Ive level 3 chars on pserver and a great majority of the players I encounter in the world are very friendly and helpful. I always think about giving my share and Ive made some friendships along the way. 
---
There are all types even on a ”small” pserver, think about what you can contribute the community with. :)
---
The amount of incoherent rambling here is impressive
---
I would LOVE to see more posts like this - there are SO MANY icons that i have no clue what they are supposed to be...for example rogue vendetta, can’t seem to figure it out no matter how much i stare at it 
---
YEAH BUT YOU DID SAY THE OTHER ONE DIDN'T YOU BIG BOY
---
what you've mentioned is for mage + druid leveling. druid rounds up and tanks everybody, mage freezes them, then they AoE them down with blizzard and hurricane. ridiculously effective from level 40 onward, you can casually do double digit number of mobs at once.
---
I´ll still be leveling while people clear Naxx. Guess I can play with their alts. 
---
"But how do you know if people have cleared Naxx on there mains?" Oh they´ll tell me.
---
What word should i use then? 
---
You're kinda right actually. I've met really friendy people aswell. Maybe i tend to focus on the negative...
---
Then you'll end up with over half of the realms dead after a month because of the tourists leaving. Meanwhile the few realms alive will face endless queues that will never disapppear because people will all migrate over. Sounds way worse to me than seeing a few more people around in game but hey, to each his own.
---
Having higher pop caps just works. It's been proven to work successfully by private servers. You want to throw that away and bank on something that is A) almost universally hated and B) has never been tested in a vanilla environment.
---
I rest my case. Higher caps &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all other 'solutions' that I've seen around here so far.
---
Yikes! Sorry didn’t mean to trigger you. Calm down before you have a heart attack.
---
Exactly.  The blue is the sky. When its small its easier to see.
---
Nobody trusts blizzard at all. Everyone is too paranoid.
---
&gt; By the time I was  full t7.5
---
tier 7.5 didn't exist in Vanilla. The gear was tier 3 before Blizz removed it/moved Naxx to Northrend. The tier you're talking about dropped during Wrath
---
Shadow priests are definitely not viable unfortunately. Basically a healing priest that specs into shadow weaving and keeps it up is worth much more % of a normal healer than shadow priest is worth % of a normal DPS, so they won't be brought by serious guilds.
---
Yeah that seems to be every redditor in a nutshell
---
I've noticed that people who call others 'toxic' are usually shit and uptight players who are not fun to play with. The ones they're referring to as 'toxic' are hit and miss.
---
&gt; Is that true? granted it’s been a very long time since I ran Naxx in vanilla but I have to imagine 40 70s geared in 5 man blues should steamroll it.
---
From [WoW Pedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Naxxramas_(original\) )     
---
*"Naxxramas was originally a 40-man raid instance floating above the Eastern Plaguelands. It was a massive necropolis and had the unquestionable honor of serving as the seat of one of the Lich King's most powerful officers, the dreaded lich Kel'Thuzad.
---
The instance was regarded as the most difficult before the release of Burning Crusade, and should not have been attempted at level 60 without at least 40 well-equipped (preferably Tier 2 or Tier 2.5 armor) players. Naxxramas was also the home of many of the most powerful items of the pre-BC era, and 60+ quests with rewards such as [Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian] and all Tier 3 items available in the game. With the release of The Burning Crusade, finishing this instance still required 25-30 well-equipped level 70 players. The dungeon was added in patch 1.11, making it the last non-expansion instance added to the core game as well as the last 40 man instance."*
---
Having ab and av only really pop on their weekends is fine, as long as they still pop at all, imo.
---
Good luck holding aggro with that strat.
---
Meh. Naxx is an incredibly boring raid if you think about it. It is also extremely simple to do.
---
And Kel'thuzad is such a shitty final boss that the only way to make him a real challenge was to spawn immortal enemies to add "tension" to his final phase.
---
The only wall in that entire raid is just Saph, and that can be overcame with 20-25 players in frost resist.
---
I'm hoping they put out raids they didn't get to finish before BC came along, or else a lot of us Naxx players will be bored.
---
Source: Cleared Naxx multiple times during Vanilla and TBC. Super meh raid.
---
what if, just what if, instead of releasing something like Burning Crusade they made an entirely new Expansion from vanilla?
---
Please define "toxic player" and "a lot" and "significant amout".
---
Depends on the environment you put yourself in, most of those raiding, I've found, are really toxic.
---
Min-maxing and speedrunning Molten (1mechanic) Core - and even Blackwing lair, to an extent -is probably one of the most laughable concepts I was ever introduced to. I get guilds want to compete with each other with better times -- but it's like having a 10-meter race. 
---
There's always a **winner,** but you're both *losers*.
---
while shadow priest are anything but weak, that spec really came to it's own in TBC, and I personally find it's classic iteration... quite boring. no vampiric touch, no shadow word: death, no shadowfiend, you're basically spamming sw:p and mind flay with the occasional mind blast for damage. troll and undead racial spells can make the experience somewhat better, but it still ain't exactly all that varied.
---
dispelling, healing and general utility are another thing entirely, it's quite entertaining how much you can fuck with people, but damage-wise, it's not the most fun spec.
---
The strat based on keeping all the mobs stunned for ~8 seconds until they're dead?
---
I like how destroying 1 paw is reasonable, but now more.
---
Run WC once to go for the mace or Living Root soon after hitting 19. 
---
depends... if you want to do pure damage, it's meh. if you want to mess with people, however, troll* shadow priest are quite amazing. say goodbye to your buffs and hey, imma throw in a 20% healing debuff for free. awww, you've attacked me? enjoy getting stunned. running from that warrior? let me dispel him and mind flay your ass.
---
*troll, because none of the other races have racial spells that even come close to the mayhem they can cause.
---
My favorite inn is on Moonguard ;)
---
I remember I joined the top guild on my server for Razorgore in BWL to see if I was recruitment worthy or not. I had never stepped foot in there before. The fight started, the initial platform mobs died, and then the spawns in the corners began. I lagged the entire fight in my corner until they started killing the boss, only then did I get a whisper from the officer (we didn't use voice chat) saying "USE THAT MANA", which had apparently been sent to me quite awhile before. I only managed to shoot like 2-3 frost bolts at the boss before it died. I was kicked out of the raid immediately lol.  
---
I never got to raid more than MC/ZG in vanilla because either my internet or computer was incapable.  
---
I've got the best internet I can get in my area (still not amazing, but capable) and am working on a new PC build at the moment.  
---
I'm happy for Classic.  
---
Not at all. The community on private servers was always helpful. You can't be toxic in vanilla without getting blacklisted. Now that doesn't mean people aren't going to talk shit to a prot pally constantly getting queued in the same bg or something like that, people have their limits.
---
There's a mixture of all sorts on private servers.
---
If you fixate on only the bad, then the bad is the only thing you'll see.
---
... No.
---
These are the kind of posts I most like to see on this sub!
---
Ironforge maybe?
---
I played on many private servers and very rarely do I see toxic players.  Vulgar, unfiltered chat spam on occasion to be sure, but once people are grouped with you, I have never encountered a ninja or anything.  Some people are very grumpy though.
---
Is instance lockout 1 hour after do you do your first /reset you'll get another set of five? Resets 'on the hour' ingame time? I forget, haven't done farming with resetting in a while haha
---
The rent really went up when Blizzard axed the second floor of Ironforge.
---
Imdeed
---
That’s. 
---
Not. 
---
Vanilla. 
---
Why does everyone here assume their version of the game is the correct one. 
---
I'm aware. I was specifically referring to taking drugs
---
Just stop lying for cryin out loud. Druid is horseshit as dps in vanilla, they are fun to play - hey I played feral tank as alt and geared him in my 1.12 private project guild in AQ40 but claiming they outdps casters is just stupid.
---
What is the buff you linked? Is it practical to get this to raid?
---
Also, how does the build work? Since you picked that weapon I assume it’s all about proc items and spellpower?
---
&gt; The tier you're talking about dropped during Wrath
---
Pretty sure that was his point. It was so easy in Wrath he solo'd it
---
Why spend money to make new content when you can make the same amount of money releasing content that already exists for half the cost?
---
I don’t want to shit all over the OP, seems like a nice enough guy but this is largely correct. 
---
I played on Lightning's Blade NA and we always called it VC or Deadmines. I think part of the disagreement has more to do with faction differences. Horde players simply didnt run Deadmines and so DM was always Dire Maul for horde.
---
I miss the old tavern ambience too, you could hear people talking but not make out a word they're saying, it made the inn feel more alive
---
Played on Gul\`dan too. Never saw anyone call the deadmines "vc".
---
I am newer to private servers (playing off and on for about a year)  absolutely there can be some toxicity. Due purely to it not being a blizzard run shop. More outright racism and whispering opposing factions with racial slurs than I ever imagined existed during Vanilla.
---
However those players are still the minority. Most people I played with where helpful and talkative during groups, offered to help with quest chains, and would explain things in whisper to both help you out and to do so without embarrassing you. So although the toxic players are more toxic than they were in retail, the helpful ones are more helpful too. Having no true cross faction separation, it being free and also it being a 13 year old game I feel exaggerates both ends of the spectrum. 
---
Are you really comparing wrath naxx to vanilla naxx?
---
Hogger will be the dopest hang spot for the first month lol
---
T5 pally was never seen enough.
---
He said in a forum for a game from 2004
---
You can compare anything. The guy he was replying to was commenting about Naxx still being too hard for some in TBC, and he followed up with a comment about the state of Naxx in Wrath. Jeez, dude. 
---
I'm pretty sure that I've seen HamsterWheelGaming talk about the fact that the numbers between Vanilla and Wrath barely changed if at all so the damage was done to the raiders in vanilla was the same as in Wrath even though lvl80s had a ton more stats.
---
it's also neat that after classic was announced they added a map that's basically a mini version of AV
---
I'd rather have 0 loot support what so ever from GMs, than have loot trading.  
---
They should just say "Sorry guys, if you get ninja'd, the community has to deal with it themselves. There will be no loot support in Classic WoW, except in those cases where a boss bugs and you can't receive the loot."  
---
Vancleef yo :P ive always referred to deadmines as VC since i learned it back in Vanilla. always confuses so many people but its habit. 
---
There are no inherent problems allowing items like those to be available under a new distribution method, the problem is the implications that this enables.
---
I can guarantee you that any items sold in a shop will be a financial success in Classic so they will not limit the shop contents to only these type of items and who know what they will start selling then, potentially items that could have a negative effect on the game and it's various aspects.
---
I am now picturing a swarm of flies all gathering around the handle and swinging the sword, magic animated sword style. 
---
So what if I'm a shadow priest and Mind Flay the boar's brain into slurry?
---
not when you consider who is die hard enough to raid on a pserver.
---
Not when you consider who is die hard enough to play classic wow 
---
The attunement cost isn't even that bad. Any player who's done a dozen or so strat runs will only have to pay the equivalent of like 100g.
---
What exactly do you need to be updated on? They have told us everything we need to no so far 
---
Uther also has a Judgement skin. Although Uther is based on the WarCraft 3 model proportions, which are a lot bulkier than WoW’s art style for humans: https://blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/judgement-uther-skin-full.jpg
---
Solo it at like L42 or so. It's a good enough weapon to carry you to 60 so you may as well unless you manage to get your hands on something better (such as Bonebiter).
---
Ravager is fun but it's honestly not a very good weapon.
---
No it doesn’t. DR doesn’t affect monsters at all.
---
Where have you been the last like.. Three years? This has been in motion since Nost shutdown, if not prior to that. They have given 4 updates, 2 of them being Blizzcon.
---
Mage first. Get some gold together and buy your rogue a few nice weapons for while they level!
---
&gt;9 days 2 hours
---
&gt;L42
---
Yea, I was healing on my pally in T6 through a lot of naxx
---
No. Those rules only make things worse.
---
reading the wow vanilla diary, a big reason it was as popular with casuals as it is, because it was the first MMO you COULD play solo if you wanted.
---
Doubt it will be so few. Naxx is hard yeah, but with 15 years for people to hone strats and mechanincs it won't pose nearly as much of an obstacle as it used to.
---
If I remember right, and I'm about 75% confident, it starts from the moment you first enter an instance.
---
Hell yeah
---
It was always vc not dm.
---
Dm was diremaul 
---
Mind Blown. thank you.
---
nah no jeez, he's right. vanilla naxx was tuned for 40 and was the most challenging raid content created.  blizzard strategically shifted their raid strategy because so few people succeeded in vanilla naxx.
---
that's actually the \_entire\_ reason they tuned it down and reintroduced it only 1 expansion later.
---
*Sneaky Pete!*
---
Focusing down VC as fast as possible and making use of whatever crowd control your party has available on the adds is the most surefire way to obtain a kill. Assuming you don't want to cheese him with the cannon trick. 
---
I like to think WoW meta was still very young back then. Did we even have near the amount of theorycrafting and datamining we do now?
---
One thing I don't remember ever seeing in trade chat in vanilla was a mention of 'pre-raid BiS'. That seems like something that must have come about recently on private servers. Or just never noticed, being that I was 14.
---
Why'd you delete it
---
well i mean, at early levels the value of it is actually pretty decent, for 10 rage and one gcd, which doesn't mean much early as you have heaps of gaps for gcds, yet it removes a huge chunk of the dmg you would take.
---
Fuck blizzard and fuck censorship.
---
Mods are gay, Blizz is gay
---
The only thing that would make it passable for me would be only items that are master looted can be loot traded. Since that is where most the problems came from right?
---
The way I see it, there's every reason to have both the best and worst people playing Classic.
---
Every reason to have people not take things so seriously because now we know how easy the actual gameplay of the game is, so we can just all relax.
---
Every reason to have people take things overly seriously for exactly the same reason and so now the only challenge left is how hard we can push and min/max ourselves in the eyes of those toxic people.
---
It's not surprising to me private servers would have a lot of Classic diehards that fall into the latter camp.  But when Classic in 2019 is launched, I think the audience will be overall much more like the former camp.  At least for a while it should be like that.
---
its just a loud vocal minority with no consequence because its not well monitored like a blizz server. theres plenty of toxic people and plenty of grown ass adults playing a game they loved years back and still do 
---
For me it would dilute the special feeling of other things that are not purchased.
---
Slipper slope towards the same feeling I personally dislike in retail (and inversely enjoy about vanilla)
---
I actually really appreciate this post for this alone. Nice to get some perspective on different people's leveling times, like Asmongold's mom's 60 in 50 days. 
---
I played on several servers and even tried calling it DM, only for people to get mad at me for using the wrong abbreviation. VC was the norm for vanilla and DM seems to be the variation. But part of vanilla culture was the deviation that existed in it. The little, ever so slight differences between everyone's server, guild, and even the little suboptimal variations in talents, and it made every story something different.
---
Pick either, I'm still gonna viper sting you to pieces :p
---
Toxic ^
---
Some terms do get popular and end up grossly misused as a result, for sure.  Toxic is supposed to refer to someone that can't keep their shitty attitude and behavior to themselves and irritates other people in such a way that those people then act the same way towards others in a sort-of domino effect.  It doesn't *just* mean someone that's an asshole and annoys you, though they're usually nearly the exact same kind of person anyway by nature.
---
"Snowflake" is another one.  Apparently, a lot of people now think it means a very fragile person that can't take any criticism, but its original slang definition was to describe someone that wanted to be very special &amp; unique and thought they really were when they really weren't.  "Special snowflake" was the full term.  Just like toxic, though, such people were almost always very fragile people too by nature.  So at least these terms haven't been warped too badly.
---
It definitely does on short duration stuns. Not sure about longer stuns like cheap shot/kidney. 
---
Pretty sure that you’re right about there being no dr in over on cc like fear or Polly though. 
---
I didn’t know
---
It's mostly Barrens Chat. 
---
Warriors are melee combatants who use Rage as a resource.
---
yikes 
---
Been playing a dam priest since 2004 and I thought the same lol
---
Toxicity, on the internet?!
---
^^ # truth
---
Why did you have to tell me this, now it dosent feel as good with red quest :( I always imagined I cheated the system when I went over yellow :D
---
That's why you always turn in the green quests first after a long circuit 😁
---
Bro can I be a tool and ask you to make me a ret pre-raid setup in the classicwow character tool for human paladin as the selection?  
---
https://www.classicwowtools.live/character  
---
Super lame of me to ask you to do that, but if you would that would be awesome. You just seem to know wtf you're talking about.  
---
Patience, young Padawan.
---
What about some sort of re-release of the cards for classic specifically? Or even have a chance to pull one from a hearthstone pack? 
---
And I would love to post more of these but some people seem to hate them.
---
I recall channeled spells being per tick specifically . Dots on initial cast only (even worse)
---
'Shitty attitude and behaviour' is in the eye of the beholder for the most part, which is why it is no coincidence that people bandying around labels like 'toxic' tend to be people who undeservedly think that they have some sort of authority on what constitutes socially acceptable conduct.
---
That's a great and well thought out counter argument. 
---
Oooh good to know.
---
A big part of that had to do with the four horsemen. My guild got very disappointed when we realized we suddenly needed 8 tanks. We didn't even have 8 warriors and we maybe had 5 with any tank gear and experience. It felt like a big fuck you to everyone except the absolute top guilds. 
---
Is there an easy way to get all the spell icon images in a large size?  
---
Thing is, they aren't EXACTLY wrong. WoW has always been about the journey you do. And with Naxxramas down and all the gear completed there's not many things left to do. Major part of the playerbase will not have any twinks (and least not to the extents we have twinks nowadays) and therefore finishing Naxx will be "finishing the game".
---
However, assuming that things go pretty well until Naxx, I'm fairly certain that we'll see discussions coming up (even prior to Naxx release) about progressive Servers. Though I fully believe that the first installation of classic will be classic forever. But we're very likely going to see additional Servers spawn up who will have a progressive setting for addons as well (up until wrath I would suspect).
---
Wtf it was supposed to be an hawk
---
You should always try to do a quest when it's yellow and avoid doing orange/red quests.  
---
The only time I advise doing an orange/red quest is if you're getting a huge item upgrade from it (Gravestone Scepter in BFD at level 18 from a carry for example)  
---
Dire Maul was always DM: East, West, ect. If you made a post saying LF1M Dire Maul, people would be confused and would then have to ask which wing.
---
I'd say most people I meet on the pservers are prity dense and knows absolutely nothing about vanilla except for their said servers mechanics.
---
They seam to think in general that everyone back in vanilla leveled solo for max exps. Or that everyone raced to 60 and did not enjoy the journey. Or that they are top tier when in reality pservers get the simplest shit wrong like vale mechanics due to lack of source material.
---
So yes, there will be a abundance of toxicity on some servers. Try and find out where all the min/maxers are heading from that community and straight out avoid it. The few ending up on a server without their legion of kids screaming "seigheil" in the Barrens chat will have a bad day since contrary to popular beliefs, you act like a complete shit head then you don't get groups. Does not matter if you are server 1 any class, no one wants you in their group unless you can behave. 
---
Okay..... that has nothing to do with my post but thank you 
---
It's a shame people are downvoting you, there's nothing wrong in not liking a game, that's why there are so many of different genres.
---
Anyway, the appeal of classic is the community, the challenge push people to group up to tackle difficult stuff you can't do alone and to know each other, also the world make it so that epic battles and events happen.
---
But if you don't like the world, the social aspect wouldn't probably be enough to make you go on.
---
My best guess is mage isnt the class for you. Its always good to try alts. I didnt get past lvl 20 until i tried rogue. 
---
My first character was a dwarf hunter when i was too young and bad to
---
Spotted retail player
---
On the german servers I played we mostly called deadmines DM and dire maul DB (since its "Düsterbruch" in german) afaik... But we had a healthy mix of german and english abrevations over the whole game so for the newer players the more confusing part was to know when which language was used 
---
Horde mage: go troll for pve. Undead if pvp focused.  I would personnally go troll for pvp still.
---
Ally mage: gnomes are better for pvp and pve.
---
Roll pve if you playing the game for looks.
---
They specifically said "No change" and the only updates they gave during Blizzcon were either about content progression and changes from Vanilla (looting and sharding). What updates would you be looking for if everything else will be the same as Vanilla. The only updates I imagine them giving is when/ if there will be a beta and then the release date of launch.
---
Tri spec priest are the best, especially on alliance.
---
On horde disc priest are good especially later on when casters have access to decent caster gear
---
Just pop a message in chat whenever an item that dropped in the dungeon is traded to a player.        
---
Blacklist whoever is being scummy with it and inform others whenever you end up in the same group again.       
---
Also encourage others to install whatever blacklist addon you've got and to add Mr. Scummy to their lists as well.
---
I have never heard VC ingame, only here on Reddit. It has always been DM for me and my server since 2005.
---
New classic servers! Classic N+1
---
Good for you...... I’ve always know it as vc since I started my human rogue in late 2004.
---
Ah, that's true, I'd have quite lots of rested every day. I can play 1 hour every day for sure, 2-3 if I sacrifice from my sleep lol.
---
I always went feral. I wana try balance but yeah, oom is an issue. I guess just stack all the INT gear and don't over cast for the health they have left? 
---
I guess one up side is high INT gear also can help if you are asked to heal. 
---
Mage+ priest aoe levelling wont be a thing.
---
Mages will just solo aoe grind and get way faster exp.
---
Maybe mage priest will work from 14-20 tough.
---
Speed running naxx!
---
Competition on time for anything!
---
Fastest (class) to (lvl)
---
Fastest dungeon runners!
---
Hunters kiting kazzak!
---
Organized world pvp battles!
---
In my opinion TCG has no place in vanilla. Not spectral tigers or anything. No store mounts of any kind.
---
Yes, this.
---
This. Most important part of Classic Leveling. Know the circles you can run. Having a decent questing route is the best "boost" you can get for your leveling experience.
---
You want a change? Then start kicking these people from groups and blacklist them, there is no more effective way then them struggleing to find a group due to shitty behavior 
---
Please, I always did deadmines as a horde. It was a ton of fun to make the trek up from booty bay
---
The forbid everyone from dealing with those tickets, problem solved. If someone breaks that then give out punishment. I'd rather have no support at all than deal with loot trading and its many drawbacks (including radically changing player interaction).
---
It is a lot of fun to stealth past stuff and get to the end of a quest without all the slow grinding through the mobs. 
---
I've always wanted to join a guild of just druids and rogues. All of us just go on stealth raids. It would be so neat to see 1 druid out in the open, then boom, 30 other figures pop out of stealth surrounding that one druid. 
---
It would be like secret service stuff, escorting one person while everyone is hidden. Imagine the other faction seeing that druid, charging in to kill it, and suddenly you are walking through 30 stealthed druids/rogues you didn't know where there. 
---
You will find both more hardcore and more casuals. The good thing about this increased knowledge is a lot of casual guilds will be succesful because the average player is performing well above the average in vanilla 
---
-complains that vanilla is boring because you only quested.
---
You quested on a pserver, most likely alone due to the none vanilla mindset these kids have.
---
You did not do any dungeons judging by your post.
---
Congratulations m8 you played yourself. You sound exactly like my friends brother who claimed wow had no lore because he did not see any story development in the first hour of the starting zone. 
---
I've known it as every way people have said it: DM, dm, VC, Deadmines, Westfall dungeon, hurrdurr DM Noob Wing. I still don't think it matters at all what anyone calls it, as long as they all are capable of reading the context that someone in Westfall isn't looking for a Dire Maul group, or a low level in stormwind isn't looking for more people for DM East when he goes "LFM DM".
---
&gt; You won’t be invited to a progression guild as hybrid DPS, period because they are still inferior to their pure dps counterparts.
---
Yeah but aren't resto druids also inferior healers?
---
It's just beta, they'll have it fixed by launch.
---
Tbh you join a 40 pug you deserve this.
---
It's just been an incredibly easy troll since the game came out. From the beginning, even if someone said LFG VC, someone would still bring up the topic in general chat.
---
Exactly 
---
Chill
---
I'm fairly certain it has always been this way, ever since and even on retail vanilla, it's just the fact that before the special snowflake era, nobody actually gave a shit.
---
You couldn't be more wrong, the vast majority of players will not quickly blow through all the content. 
---
Feral Druids are great.
---
You have to put in twice the effort of other people though to be close in terms of damage. 
---
You won't outdamage equal other people, but you bring a utility they don't.
---
since you must be talking from experience as a healer and/or tank, here are some tips:
---
as a war/pala tank: equip a shield, as a drood equip anything
---
as a healer: buy higher ranks than the first
---
I'll be with you
---
Didn't know that, thanks for the info.
---
Uh, who is right? I was only pointing out that the Wrath guy was just illustrating how entirely different the difficulty became. Which is basically what you just did, too. 
---
yo dude used to be a bit csgo fan but stopped playing long ago. buy insurency: sandstorm its like a more realistic counter strike ive been loving it look up some videos about it. 
---
how do they usually release content on private servers? Like one patch every few months or so starting from first release vanilla? But they keep all the classes + abilities the same, they just "open up" the new raids?
---
Thanks for the post. I played wow during vanilla up till retail and have played on multiple private servers and legit did not know this... in fact I am shocked thinking about all the easy green quests I skipped thinking it was not worth my time. How did you discover this? Do you have a source? Not saying you making it up but just wanted to read it for myself I guess lol
---
I like the variety of inns in Classic WoW. There are plenty of unique inns. But the dwarven one is one of the coziest.
---
All I can see in that pic is Day9 doing his baby ruth face. 
---
/facepalm
---
So, 90% of the Classic players will NEVER get bored?
---
Because, let's be honest here...Naxxramas, for 90% of the player base is going to be off-limits.
---
Usually it starts at about patch 1.5, then bwl, then zg, (world dragons about here), then aq, (pvp update somewhere around here), then naxx. Often uses 1.12 talents throughout but usually itemisation etc follows how it happened in patches, like how lots of gear changed to +hit only later.
---
That was because TBC was announced.
---
Not because Naxx was released.
---
Server activity dropped simply because TBC changed everything.
---
fascinating, thanks for the info!
---
They are doing it like idiots. As fast as possible.
---
It feels fucking good the times where you get things like Whirlwind Axe at level 30 or whatnot. 
---
There no more toxic than this sub really. 
---
Some are friendly some are not. 
---
#keepclassicclean
---
I expect 10% of the guilds to finish AQ 40 at some point, probably well after Naxx release.
---
As for finishing Naxx?
---
I don't know, maybe 5%? Maybe?
---
Played this game since beta and not complained on the forums once so your wrong random internet stranger
---
If you want to clear it, you will , trust me. Things are different now
---
I am sorry, but who the fuck puged Naxx in Vanilla???
---
I think you are confusing Vanilla Naxx with Wrath Naxx.
---
Wrath Naxx was a complete joke.
---
Why was it called VC? I've only ever played Horde but have seen both abbreviations used randomly.
---
It's true actually. I dated Blizz briefly in the early 2000s.
---
Perhaps everything he linked in his post...?
---
I’m betting Classic gets far more traction that BFA
---
They have told us everything we need to know. 
---
I'm not even sure if it's about being casual. It wasn't like we used LFG for Naxx40 (we did get an epic pug there from the Argent Dawn LFRP channel once at 70 though!), it was just for 5-mans. I mean, maybe it's about that too, but from my perspective: I could be selective about who I play with. "lfm 4 brd tnak and heeler!!!!1" - no, "LFM for BRD. We need a healer please" - yes. Maybe some would view this as snobbery, but I think it's more of a generation gap/age difference thing. 
---
I want to be able to choose who I play with, and group with like-minded people. There's less incentive to do that now, and I'm less likely to find such folks around.
---
Negative. Still plenty of unanswered questions. Maybe you are just not as interested in the game as the rest of us. There’s plenty of things on the table that could strongly influence the games outcome and it would be a shame if we didn’t hear another word about any of these facets of the game until beta
---
You do know that tcg items existed in vanilla...?
---
Yeah I kinda agree. Drag it out. It’s the best way to stop Classic having a short life.
---
Beta would be the perfect time to announce surface level issues like these, the big things have been explained.
---
I understand kids these days are impatient but this isn’t going to make the game come any faster.
---
Honestly I think most people that say that, just mean they'll down majority of the bosses, with the exception of 4H/Saph/KT. That will still be miles ahead of what most people downed in vanilla. Most people never even entered the instance. Majority of guilds still struggled with BWL and AQ. Very few people even had an incentive to try naxx because they didn't want to farm the rep with no guarantee to enter it due to a lack of guilds attempting, and a new xpac was coming anyway so what was the point. People had the options to take a short breather before the xpac, prep level a new class, or intensively farm and raid for a few months for the chance at gear that might get replaced soon after (though it stayed decent for longer than expected). 
---
I don't think that will be the case anymore, based on the fact that every private server with naxx released has people fully decked in t3 soon after. I doubt there will be an exciting new xpac already on the horizon by the time it's released again. I mean, you can easily pug your way through BWL now on private servers. Never even saw a successful pug MC/Ony/AQ/ZG on my servers in retail (not the same for everyone obviously). People have had like a 5 year beta on pservers to run everything, and while obviously there will be a different population on classic, I'm sure many of those players will be there, able to help others figure out what the fuck theyre supposed to do. The information is all readily available nowadays, that was part of the battle before. 
---
There will be a very big amount of toxic players.
---
Reason being pretty much something that Preach said in one of his recent videos. The "know-it-alls" will feel so big. Those players who have been in Vanilla WoW and ever since but never really did top-end-raiding, those players will become mayor "ugh, i was in vanilla, you should do this and that and yadda yadda".
---
Key to avoid those, thanks to SERVERS, is pretty simple: get a solid guild. Be nice, friendly and active from the get go and you'll be surrounded by people with a likewise mentality.
---
Players who have been on private servers for a long time and will play on classic servers are also an issue. There will be mayor elitism going on and I'll most certainly stay away from that. You know, those raid leaders in Molten Core that will be like, "ough, but wheres that one guy that debuffs the boss using this and that weapon?!" (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AERpvRRvHWk). 
---
Finding a guild with the right mindset will be key to a good classic experience. Surround yourself with people who are chillaxed and classic is gonna become an awesome experience.
---
I was 32 when I started WoW in 2005.
---
This mantra of "people back in Vanilla didn't knew anything" is absolute BS. When I started WoW in late 2005, EVERYTHING was known. Thottbot was a thing. Allakhazam was a a thing. Elitis Jerks was a think. Sure, there weren't many SOURCES of information, but those FEW sources had EVERY INFORMATION you could think off.
---
Elitist Jerks was a MASSIVE FORUM. The theorycrafting on Elitist would take a lifetime to read it.
---
We knew of BiS in Vanilla. We knew of everything.
---
Main reason I wait for Classic is to see all those non-Vanilla players waking up the a harsh reality : the one that contradicts all their dumb "it was easy AF, just time consuming" mentality.
---
Sure, MC and ZG and AQ20 will be easy....but come BWL, they will wake up. Not even 30% of the guilds will clear BWL. And BWL compared to AQ40 and Naxx was fuck easy.
---
Ahh nice, assume I’m a kid; makes your argument much stronger and more valid. Assuming you didn’t play BFA because they delayed until beta and then simply didn’t address any issues raised during that time until months later. It would be pretty fucking rad if blizzard attacked problems before they arose. I’m not sure what hill you are trying to defend: do you simply not want to hear any more information about the game?? I really don’t think you enjoy classic as much as the rest of us
---
Bad troll
---
This is the kind of thing that used to be true but simply no longer is. Players are so much better nowadays, both for game and economics. The attunement cost isn't that high if you'll stick around until the time naxx opens.
---
Yes, but they dont have anything to do with vanilla.
---
Yes I played bfa, for about 3 weeks it was horrible.
---
There are no issues so far for them to discuss with us, when they have more information they will tell us.
---
I’m not defending any hills, if anything I enjoy classic more than you. 
---
I always thought I was a white bird flying for some reason. 
---
Plenty of servers in retail vanilla referred to deadmines as VC.
---
The thing with sunder is that until L40ish you won't really be stacking that many of them before it's dead so the payoff isn't great, and after 40 arms with MS is too good to pass up until you at least have some +hit gear.
---
Have patience.
---
Don't think i ever encountered it being called "VC" on any EU realm that i've played on. Sometimes i think calling it VC is more of a US thing maybe.
---
I guess that’s just a matter of opinion then. I can’t think of anywhere else tcg items that were added in vanilla would fit better than vanilla
---
I agree. Large games like this always have thier asshole parts of the community. Kinda been debating joining an rp-pvp server, have heard I lit of great thing about the RP community. 
---
Rents are through the roof but NOBODY is building new apartments. 
---
At the same time, we have a whole empty city part (Old Ironforge) that could easily fit dozens if not hundreds of new apartments if they'd just fix the lava problems. But that won't happen because the government would rather spend gold on waging expensive wars in Kalimdor. That's the last time I'm voting for a Bronzebeard. Next time I'm going Dark Iron so we can fix real problems for real people right here in our own dwarven lands.
---
DM was taken by Dire Maul, and the final boss of Deadmines in Vanilla is Edwin VanCleef.
---
Oh so what Ur saying Is classic servers will die After 2 years because the content is done like it happened on vanilla private servers? Gotcha!
---
No wait!? Aren’t vanilla private servers going strong for 10 years by now?
---
I suffered a confusion here
---
Looks like 2 hands pressing on a bloody chest, i.e. CPR. You see the thumb on the left hand under the right hand. Or is it just me? :)
---
I edited my first comment. Tl;DR cant see how it would be implemented that is true to vanilla.
---
They have never, in 15 years, told us servers caps. So they wont now.
---
How many realm? Why would that matter? 1 active one is enough.
---
Ally and horde on the same pvp server? Wont happen because they told us "no change".
---
I was a beastmaster so the giant red angry crocodile helped, also wasn't 60
---
Only 2% ever seen Naxx. If this game lasts 5 years then it's better than most.
---
The data from private servers is skewed. You can't go by percentages. 147 guilds cleared MC results in 5,880 lvl 60 raiders. Add in the additional 10-15 raiders per guild, to sustain a healthy raider base, and an additional 20-30 casuals and socials, and you are looking at roughly 11-12k server population.
---
18 guilds that cleared Naxx, each guild having 50-60 raiders, and you are looking at maximum 1,080 players that cleared Naxx on that PRIVATE server.
---
Now...Classic servers will obviously NOT have 11-12k population, but a quarter of that. That would drop the numbers, in first phase, by 75%.
---
In other words, on a Classic server, there will be 36 guilds that would clear MC and only 4-5 that would clear Naxx. The numbers will actually be LOWER, per total Classic population, because not all servers will have full population, and not all servers will have the perfect amount of hardcore raiders.
---
In general, you are looking at less than 3 guilds per Classic server that will clear Naxxramas. And that is roughly 120 people in the raids, with an additional 10-15. A grand total of 165-170 people per server (median number) that will clear Naxx. Most servers will have 1-2 guilds that will be able to clear Naxx in Classic. Some server will have 4-5, some other 6 or more.
---
But, generally speaking, only around 160 people per server will clear Naxx in Classic. Looking at a 2k median population per server, that is less than 10%.
---
Add in the FACT that the encounters, armor values, gear drop chances, hit/crit/glances/etc. are incorrect on private servers. Add in the FACT that consumables and gold were pumped up by dynamic spawns and shady gold selling schemes. Add in the FACT that private servers GM's were members of the top guilds. Add in the FACT that Onyxia and ZG were on a 3/day reset timer (means faster gearing).
---
When you look at the big picture, the number of players that will clear Naxxramas in Classic will absolutely be well under 10%, closer or UNDER 5% actually.
---
NO THANKS it would be a huge mistake
---
"Same amount"? You means less than half, right? Because TBC Classic servers won't have even half the Vanilla Classic servers population.
---
i'll be bored around AQ release tbh ;)
---
Here's hoping that wind does not turn into a shard.
---
Quests stories in vanilla are way superior to modern ones tho.
---
It is that way on certain pservers. But as far as I get it there isn't any conclusive data out their to support it or deny it.
---
Depends what you consider toxic, as it’s very subjective.
---
How is whispering someone ‘inv’ any different to signing up to a m+ in the group finder? 
---
Normal and Heroic dungeons, the ones that have your group made automatically, have been irrelevant since week 2 of BfA.
---
what do you mean by "Toxic"?
---
They would still get spammed with tickets by retards
---
there's not a lack of "knowledge of the actual culture" imo. there's just a different culture.
---
Roll need and it’s soulbound so good luck.
---
If they roll need then they can’t trade it regardless
---
Every online game is like this.
---
I wouldn’t be so sure about that
---
"their version" its most likely the version we are going to get so get off ur nostalgic high horse and deal with it.
---
I just recently tried a private server in preparation for classic to get back in after 8 years of break (I quit retail in wotlk).
---
Leveled to 35 so far and I gotta say I don’t think it’s toxic at all. The community is pretty nice i have yet to come across an unfriendly player, the communication that retail lacks is back. Even encounters with the other faction are mostly pleasant by which I mean either there is a silent agreement not to kill each other while lvlling or there is some casual fighting without any excessive griefing or corpse camping (which personally I would accept as part of the experience).
---
That’s what I noticed by lvling to 35
---
WHAT
---
Its more about all the consumables you NEED to bring, and the time you need to spend getting the gear you need to raid naxx. Not all bosses are hard, but the ones that are will make you bleed consumables until your raid get it down to a routine
---
You will be in for a rude awakement when you are expected in your guild to help new people in your guild to farm the epic recipe in strat live for priests, clearing flask table in scholo for your alchemists, getting titans flask in UBRS in 2/3 guild runs etc. In the last guild I was, we did dungeon runs all the time in BWL gear for a plethora of reasons.
---
Being in a loot council or epgp guild, such commitment to the guild will be approved of. Denying all and every requests of running dungeons later in the tiers, only logging on once a week for raiding might result in a core raider kick, because you dont help the guild when its needed. Will you stop running ZG and Ony too, because you only need heart and head anymore? 
---
Be careful you don’t cut yourself on all those edges 
---
And still the retards defend LT, pathetic...
---
You can easy find other warriors tonteam up with for that quest chain and you will have a lot of fun and make new friends. It will be the same for Paladins and their mace.
---
Dude, they are laying off hundreds, Activision-Blizzard CFO went to Netflix, Blizzard CFO went to Square. Maybe you forgot that Morhaime also left.
---
Trust me, they have bigger issues on their hands.
---
We will get our updates, let's just hope the updates will be what most of us expect them to be.
---
There is still a gap, though. You literally can just walk forward and make it easily, yes. No jump required at all. Just 'W' forward. 
---
Heck, I ran a buddy through WC who just wants to twink his 19 druid out (He may not be great at the game, but I'm happy to help him play the game the way he wants to.) While in cat form, with a speed boost, he still fell. Admittedly, he's half-blind.
---
This might become the main reason I wont roll a druid for classic after all. I love the class but I don't see myself farming this item just to be a competitive melee dps.
---
Can you parry with 1h+shields?
---
Pure healing meter wise, yeah. But not too bad and their utility makes up for it. you will probably want at least 2 in your naxx raids. Motw, abolish poison, battle rez, nature's swiftness are great. And their two piece t3 bonus gives a mana\energy\rage regen on the rejuv hot.
---
It's january. I wouldn't expect any new information before march. Winter, especially holiday season is usually devoid of new information. AFter the announcement in 2017 we had to wait until next summer to get an official update.
---
What people seem to forget is that with vanilla the strategy and skill was not really what made the content hard, the gear checks for naxx were no joke. You couldn't just carry people through the gear checks for naxx. In order to raid naxx you needed at the very least mostly all bwl or higher gear, which required you to be in a guild that was clearing bwl and aq40 weekly, on top of that you had to compete against usually at least 5 other people for 1 piece of gear per boss and that's if it drops. So if everything for your class dropped every single boss fight which is statisticly impossible it could still take you a month and a half of farming raids to get all the gear you need to even begin raiding naxx, but even if that were the case you still need to make sure the rest of your guild is geared enough which takes probably 4-5 months of farming raids. You think average players are going to be farming bwl and aq40 for months? 
---
Sure the top guilds will probably clear naxx even faster this time around. The reason Naxx wasn't cleared originally wasn't because guilds didn't know what to do. To compete in vanilla raiding you needed at least 60 competent dedicated raiders willing to swap in and out of raids, staying up for hours outside raid instances so you can be swapped in for the fight they need you on just for a shot at one piece of gear. The hardest part about vanilla was having the dedication to get it done. That's not going to change, eventually average casual players might get caught up to naxx given enough time passing, I mean like years after naxx is released by that time they can always roll out fresh servers though. I don't really see the whole dilemma of everyone on a server clearing naxx and nothing to do. 
---
Except the advantage of healers/tanks is that they got a raid spot in the first place much easier than a dps. What good is being able to farm your consumables easily and do pvp easily, if you dont have a raid spot in a top guild? 
---
Source?
---
I could see the possibility of vendoring the points based inital gear which was at least one tabard.
---
However, the only thing i'd say taht sits in the middle ground are:
---
Tabard of Flame
---
Hippogryph Chick
---
Riding Turtle
---
Obviously im not bias because i had a riding turtle :P
---
basically the only ones that you could argue are in the realm are vanilla.
---
Tabard of Flame - only epic tabard - Loot Card
---
Hippogrpyh Chick - minipet/companion - Loot Card
---
Riding Turtle - Slower than walking speed mount - Loot Card
---
There was also  UTC or something points which you could get things like tabard of frost etc from.
---
people yet again confusing viable and optimal...
---
Remember that if you are using dw that you most likely have a high miss chance, so when you change your white hit to yellow hs, you gain that extra hit from it not having the negative hit from dw, as well as not rolling for a glancing blow
---
Ironforge's inn doesn't look like this
---
What does toxic means for you?
---
Give some examples, because what you consider to be toxic, might as well be perfectly normal for others.
---
Ganking sucks, sure.
---
But actual open world PvP, where you've got a small raiding party on both sides going at each other, can be pretty fun.
---
Like the back and forth between Hillsbrad and Southshore.
---
But don't forget that we're playing in the (Classic) World of **Warcraft** universe.
---
The Humans and Orcs, or Horde and Alliance have been at war for hundreds of years.    
---
We are individual citizens, living in, and a part of, that war.    
---
It's very likely that you will have had friends and family killed by the opposing faction.    
---
You've been raised to hate them and trained to kill them.
---
RP aside, if you really don't want to engage in PvP, rolling on a PvE realm.
---
What does your wife’s boyfriend feel?
---
Seriously though, have any evidence for that claim? Ever played pserver? Pay it forward is real, and I’ll take the odd (rare) bad interaction to get the good interactions. Vanilla is like life, get out there. It’s scary and you’ll meet the odd scumbag but by and large people are real and decent.
---
Fallout 76 has been doing it for me.
---
But i feel like ill just about to be burned out around the time classic launches c:
---
&gt;In reality, if you see an equal leveled, equal geared player of opposite faction, they'll probably ignore or avoid you.
---
That's not been my experience.  Run backs really suck in classic wow and lots of people attack me just on the fear that I might attack them. And they're right. The ones who ignore me quickly get a big fat aimshot in their ass followed by a 5 minute run back.
---
&gt;If you see a group of players, or ppl that out level you, or if you start fighting a mob, you instantly become at the mercy of the kid behind the keyboard of the opposite faction, he can kill you and all he has to do is want to.
---
Learn how to A) Defend yourself against ganks, B) run away when outgunned, and C) learn how to break up groups in PvP so you can kill them one at a time.
---
&gt;So can someone explain to me the purpose of openworld pvp and what makes it fun, and anything more that griefing? Maybe I'm too old now but it just seems like it gives players who are dicks a chance to be dicks and they gladly take it, but that doesn't sound enjoyable. 
---
Honestly, it just sounds like your not very good at PvP so the idea doesn't appeal to you.  Take some time to learn how to escape, use terrain to your advantage, and then gank the gankers.  You'll have a good time nailing them.
---
Morhaime left his formal position but remained as "strategic adviser" 
---
I wouldn't expect updates over christmas, so I would expect information in the next month or so as its likely staff may have only started really going back this week.
---
I instantly don't want anything to do with people who use Toxic or Problematic.  Typically they like to play the morality police and constantly act all holier than thou.
---
if you want to compete with other dps and even top them, this buff helps a lot. no spellpower gear, but spellpower buffs helps.
---
Im making a guide as we speak.
---
If you dislike world pvp, just play on a PVE server?
---
It's not confirmed it'll be for greed items only, implementing loot trading for greed only would make no sense.
---
I never get PvE players. I couldn't give a flying fuck about them and yet they endlessly agitate about PvP realms.  They're like Vegans, always telling you about how their way is right and your way is wrong, instead of letting people pick their own type of play style.
---
Close but it will actually prioritize from bottom to top. So put the most important totems last.
---
Remove the option to ticket for loot?
---
Or it is too damn hard to do it? s/
---
Actually I heard that getting a raid spot as a tank was pretty hard because only a few slots out of forty are for tanks, but whatevs. The upside of a crappy deal is less competition to take it, I guess.
---
True that. Undead rogues and furries are into some weird shit
---
The ideal comp is feral druid, 2warlocks, 1 frost mage, and a disc priest.
---
The druid pulls a large group with moonfire or proximity and can brarform back, the priest uses shield to get threat and Los, the Mahe drops a Blizzard to slow the mobs and the warlocks Sav their void walkers for shields and run in to hell fire.
---
The mage should have threat, the warlocks stuns help interrupt casts and keep them in place, the druid can Zant and stun any mob out of control, priest sticks with mage incase threat is kept.
---
Disc is used for more mana and big shields, group gets motw, fort, ai, ds, free food/mana.
---
You underestimate the size of packs that can be pulled using this.
---
The strat comes online around level 37 in sm where it's possible to pull massive amounts of mobs at one without any real threat to the casters. The comp handles bosses well too, and should have extremely good gear all the way up to brd making it even easier.
---
Generally the priest levels tailoring and enchanting beside to give more strength to the party's equipment as there is an abundance of enchanting mats.
---
The more difficult part of this comp is getting to 37 as a 5man. It is possible to aoe grind through deadmines and gnomer and rfk, the gear flooding in is good, just doesn't go fast, so seeking out a non-drop based questing path needs to be done to fill the gaps up to lvl 20, with good aoe grind spots to supplement it
---
Players will deal with ninjas as long as we have no CrossRealm bullshit. You wont be able to join a single good guild after ninjaing an item.
---
Except such a thing was never mentioned. Quite the other way around. Ion kinda said "sorry ninjas, no more excuses for miss click need on an item".
---
Which implies that Ion have no idea what he is talking about, OR loot trading in Classic will be available for need rolls also.
---
Which is it? I have no idea, since nobody EXPLICITLY said how loot trading will work.
---
this, also if there are new Update / Progress posts people will start over analyze them and take wrong conclusions like it happend at Blizzcon with "/lfr" and "sharding". But at blizzcon they could talk direcetly about it on the panel to clear it up.
---
I think the next Information from Blizz (at least a major one) will not be before mid April - May where they either announce a Beta or a condifdent to get to release without one.
---
I have problems understanding what you are actually asking.
---
There are no decently populated pve private servers. That is likely the reason. PvE players feel like they need to play PvP servers to experience the content because that's where the majority of players are for private servers. The classic launch will be different but for now private servers are based around PVP servers.
---
Prime example of why giving in to even the smallest change is wrong, how people use one change as a precedent to leverage in more changes and why the “slippery slope is a fallacy” argument is ultimately wrong and a fallacy of itself.
---
I don't know why you write this, I definitely know the Judgment set, I was reflecting to that model specifically which I replied to, and is not the exact same as the one presented in world of warcraft, and gave my insights why I think it lacks "life".
---
That model is not from vanilla, but a rethink of the paladin tier 2 set. 
---
Making them available in-game would definitely feel wrong - a lot of these were some of the rarest items in the game.  Putting them in a shop would completely avert that trend. Even though they were basically microtransactions back in the day, putting them out in an unlimited supply would wreck the spirit of them.
---
What I think they COULD be used for though, is to garner Actiblizzard some public favour. Run a charity drive, donating puts you in the running to win one of those fabled TCG items. Say they distribute 1000 spectral tigers, spread across all realms/servers. 50 go to the top donors. 450 are randomly distributed, but are biased towards higher donations (could base this off the retail cost of a TCG pack - every "pack" earns you one entry), and the remaining 500 are distributed entirely randomly among all entrants who passed some minimum threshold (just enough to mitigate abuse - $5 or so should be enough.)
---
Bam, you get a handful of TCG items out into the world, but there's a limited supply and people can't just buy them. A bunch of money gets donated to charities. Actiblizzard gets some good PR. No microtransaction BS gets put into Classic. Everybody wins.
---
Seriously though. Some updates on the sharding, plans for content release, or even just about an alpha or a beta would be SUPER nice. But you know, gotta pump out those store mounts in BFA :/
---
As I mentioned in my first comment I dont have an issue that they exist, but it is how they have to be implemented. 
---
Try holding quests without follow-ups (or good weapon upgrades) as turning them in only hurts your XP from killing mobs as mobs will award less and less XP as you outlevel them while quests reward the full amount until grey.
---
Unnecessarily turning in a quest can cost you a lot of XP in the long run though this is typically only an issue in the Lvl 1-20 range.
---
Nah, retail fanbase way more toxic. Period. 
---
It's super easy: shift-click the name of the guy. You'll see his level and know what he's referring to.
---
All players are potentially toxic. Stop attracting no-brainers, as they will try to avoid the inclusion of PS Players.
---
TLDR: Go away.
---
&gt;Even encounters with the other faction are mostly pleasant by which I mean either there is a silent agreement not to kill each other while lvlling or there is some casual fighting without any excessive griefing or corpse camping (which personally I would accept as part of the experience).
---
I had a warrior came after 18 times the other day while leveling in Salt Flats.  I kill him 10 times, he killed me 5 times and either he or I ran away when losing the fight 3 times.  Outstand PvP.  I eventually left because I wanted to level, but I saluted the guy before I took off because he played his class to the max and put the war in warcraft.
---
When I started wow I rolled on one of the most hardcore world PvP servers out there and I simply don't understand why people dislike griefing and world PvP.  It's all fun and danger for me.  One the first things I learned was how to escape a group corpse camp.  Corpse cammping was so common on my server that I carried invsiablity pots with me at all times. It was great fun escaping higher level players after they wasted all that time trying to corspe camp me.
---
People have a moral adversion to corpse camping, but I just view it as part of being in the middle of a war between two factions.  I personally almost never do it, but not because I find it morally wrong, but rather because I find it boring. 
---
&gt; no real loss if their characters are deleted
---
I don't think there's any difference between having your pserver characters deleted and having your retail characters deleted.
---
At some point yes - you will eventually get bored. Give it a break and return with a reroll ! I believe so little % of people will actually be at Naxx when it releases even. This game will give everybody years to come with breaks now and then.
---
I just joined a server last night and 30 minutes into leveling, a guild went into General to recruit " people with Autistic humor"
---
Odds are they were either toxic, White, or both :y
---
Correction they are UDE points - I think the UDE stuff could be purchasable as they were made defunct.
---
The loot card stuff would be best done as account linked for the players that had those original three. keeps it rare and follows the community idea of those players being known etc.
---
Lol same.  Every time one of these gets posted I am like .... no duh.  This one though the icon just seemed too small and not as obvious maybe?
---
They whined about it in vanilla too.  And we'd tell them to roll on a PvE server and they'd just continue to try to eliminate PvP servers instead of moving to the server they belonged on. 
---
The "problem" as I see it is that if they throw them in the store they're going to be super common and many people will buy them, which is NOT the vanilla experience.
---
In my opinion, there are two acceptable ways of handling these
---
Either they give them to the people who had them originally (e.g. redeemed them before TBC launched) OR they're simply not in the game.
---
Personally I lean towards the former as the best option, but that might just be me wanting my panda pet clouding my judgement.
---
That's some kind of power-level behaviour, which is fine, but not anyone wants that. I'm quest completist and I'll do every quest in game, so I'm going to pick up green quests and I only hope that not a lot of quests will turn gray, because they are literally invisible in the game! Unless they'll implement that option to turn on low level quests from modern client which I would like, honestly.
---
Except DM was called DM way before dire maul came out.
---
My younger self thought it Was a Train lol
---
Good for you... I never heard anyone call it VC untill I started on Nost.
---
As Blizzard has already said there won't be a link between Classic servers and retail servers.   
---
Furthermore, blue posts have highlighted the specifics for collector's edition (and I assume this extends to other pruchases like the TCG) likely won't be linked to your classic character either.
---
Personally, I agree with this decision. It isn't true to vanilla that people who bought them 15 years ago are the only ones who have access to these ultra rare items. When vanilla came out everyone initially had the option to buy CE and TCG mounts when they launched. It isn't part of the vanilla experience that you are locked out of unique items because you didn't buy them 15 years prior. 
---
If you think you can grief someone by just killing them then world pvp isn't for you. You can't grief someone just because you're engaged in world pvp on a pvp server, you're signing up to be corpse camped, killed whilst farming or questing, ganked by 60s, mind controlled into lava and killed repeatedly till you spirit rez, if you can't handle it they made PvE servers for the more sensitive players.
---
Yup, it reminds me of when riot released stats showing there was a very high correlation between people who actually got banned and people who reported a lot of people.
---
Ohh of course but then they would need to rerelease the stuff which i guess could be an option.
---
We still don't really know what they will end up doing, so we have to wait and see honestly.
---
They could always i guess depending on how the battlenet stuff works have both options open but they might just leave it raw until towards the end of the classic cycle.
---
Lol Casuals. Once I get full T3 on my Holy Pally, I can start leveling an alt. Then do it all over again.
---
Of course player's on both sides are likely to be biased. I can understand that you want recognition for buying the CE back in the day - and it is an awesome collectible to have!   
---
Blue posts have said that the link for CE pets between retail and classic servers are unlikely to happen.   
---
Personally, I would prefer either they didn't exist in Classic.   
---
I agree stores are not at all part of the vanilla experience, but I would prefer everyone at least having the option of purchasing it than some select few have the pets and none else had a chance. This is however far from ideal, I know, hence just don't include them.
---
Yes, since Classic is part of the retail subscription I doubt we will see a Classic: Collector's Edition.   
---
I would expect a lot of drama if they decided to do it, but even more drama if they decided to include the pets from the original collector's edition. Either way Blizzard faces a dilemma.   
---
Personally, I wouldn't mind a Classic: Collector's Edition for those who wants to support Classic or Activision Blizzard (unlikely), but the important thing - for me - is that the player's had a CHOICE to purchase it or not. 
---
&gt; So can someone explain to me the purpose of openworld pvp and what makes it fun, and anything more that griefing?
---
Well I love it. I dont think I can explain it and I totally understand not everyone like it and want to play on pve servers.
---
Ganking sucks but open world PvP does amazing things for making the world feel dangerous and like there is actual conflict between the Alliance and Horde.  WoW isn't WoW if the factions can walk up to each other and just high five.
---
This dude was literally whispering himself, tho.
---
Doubtful.
---
even better, Sunken Temple
---
New servers roll out all the time for people to start fresh. All the old naxx progressed servers are super dead.
---
Thats because there is a numbers threshold where you start recognizing people all around you on a server. 10000 people on a server means you can essentially hide in the crowd. If youre a total prick and even ninja you can still find groups ignorant of your behaviour.
---
On a Blizzlike server with 1-2k on each faction things become very "homey" very quickly. Your toxicity will be known quickly and people will avoid you like the plague. Ninjas will be blacklisted and might aswell stop playing on the server. 
---
Lastly, I think that it wont be the unjaded "innocence" of the vanilla experience in terms of community, but it wont be a DOTA2 flaming experience either. Just gotta find people that have a good vibe and be consistent in not doing dungeons/raids/bgs with people you dont wanna deal with. 
---
Classic Supporters Edition - new cash shop item ;P have like 3 tiers activision can make their money ;P
---
I would continue to farm naxx endlessly at that point if I would ever reach it. I hope that there will be enough like-minded people and enough new people to compensate for those who left. That said, my non-standard time zone probably will force me to quit or switch to retail and that's a sad state of things.
---
I'll say this. I was listening again the ClassiCast stream with Staats and Kern and got to this passage where they addressed the Customer service and the Bandwidth costs:
---
https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=1h15m28s
---
(lasts until 1:16:35)
---
Bitch I'm still playing Diablo 2.
---
Not OP, but Ill give you an example:
---
Join Wsg bg, its 2v2 in flag caps. The second you zone in, you see a enemy player running up to your flag while an allied player has the enemy flag and is just entering the room. This occured in the timespan of 1 second.You get stunned 1 second after you zone in, the enemy player grabs the flag and is out of the room. The allied player with the enemy flag starts flaming you in caps in the channel. It doesnt end there. He starts flaming you in whispers. After the bg he starts flaming you in global channel. You ignore him and he logs onto a new character to keep flaming you. 
---
I wouldn't play like that. My character is made to play forever, for years at least. I guess that's why I never played for long on private servers, I can't bear the fact that my character will be deleted.
---
it's only launch, they'll have everything fixed by the first pat... wait
---
I just feel the problem should be dealt with at the source. The source of the problem is that premades want to face pugs for easy honour farming. So the solution should be to give a honour penalty for the premade when fighting against a pug. Make premades vs premedes more rewarding perhaps than pugs vs pugs, but don't make it rewarding for a premade to farm a pug.
---
Probably. This is my opinion as well. So I will play from a pesimistic point of view and enjoy the short period after launch till the first bs changes start trickling in...
---
Do you really need 8 warriors? Or they will just made fight easier?
---
Yes and yes. The game is many years old, it have been figured out. Which is why some people get frustrated and/or toxic when people still after so many years don’t know half of these basic things. Be that because they’re new or just don’t care.
---
I think the color just represents how relevant that amount of experience is. If it's low % it's green if high % (to your next level) it's red. 
---
Dude.  I never even set foot in Nax and played for over 2 years @60 with a decent raid set.  Never even seen the place.  MC was it. I mean, how many people that come on hear and talk about running Nax do we honestly think are not FoS?  I can tell u in all honesty that it wasn’t even a consideration for most of the folks I played with even those in raid guilds. Nax in Vanilla was a fucking meat grinder.  GL and gg. 
---
There's also the [Inn!](https://imgur.com/s7UfhIH) at Aerie Peak. Differs from the classic Inn design, but still technically a functioning dwarfen Inn.
---
i hope ill live to see a classic server where the majority of the playerbace managed to progress through Naxx
---
Reminds me of this old post

I have good experiance with ps players. Reddit  community is a whole other beast tho.... have seen here much more toxic people then i ever did on a ps
---
There is always resto and bear.

White bandit mask

---
Because of corrupt GMs, server shutdowns, newer and better scripted servers showing up etc. Not because of everyone running around in T3....
---
I dunno. I play on a private server and all I have had were very wholesome, very heartwarming experiences. 
---
Same is true for me. The excitement of the danger of being ganked. I also main a druid, so often I try to stealth before enemies see me (especially high level enemies). I also don't gank without reason but I am happy to return the favour (provided level is equal).
---
Yeah but can't you get a lot of that utility from a feral as well?
---
On the other hand there's no hurry in Classic which means that you could gear up for 10 years before stepping in Naxx and they you can slowly kill bosses for the next 10 years.
---
Always subconsciously saw it as a bat or something 
---
While I do agree with all your points on the enhancement shaman, I still think they're going to be brought along to a lot more raids than people think. The content is going to be a steam roll right up until Naxxramas/the later half of AQ40, the truth is you can bring multiple "meme specs" to the raids and still clear it with ease, as has been proven time and time again over the last few years of private servers.
---
Preach, brother.
---
I used to keybind anything, but now I'm using a mix between keybinds and mouse clicks. Something like warlock health stone or health potion or dps potion is perfectly fine to click for me.
---
Yes! It was at the release week in Germany. I played a gnome and got completely lost in Dun Murogh for many hours. After some time I went to the kitchen and when i looked out of the windows I noticed that it started snowing. The first snow of the year. Dun Morogh. Fucking magic.
---
there should just be like a compendium that says what everything is imo, would love to see it 
---
They do get raid spots as nightfall bots on pvt servers, but its more optimal to just have one of the off-tanks equip a nightfall and use the shamans spot for a real dps'er. 
---
IIRC rep isn't affected by colors at all, it's a set standard when completing the quest, even with gray quests.
---
An american thing. On En-GB it was DM for deadmines an DM E etc for dire maul wings.
---
I used to do low level quests just for the rep for the other mounts. So I'm sure something similar happens, I just can't remember if the quests were grey and I was still getting full rep or if they were green. I want to say they were grey and I solely did them for the rep.
---
There were times when we 'filled in' and helped other guilds.
---
I guess I called it pugging.
---
Sorry your panties were put into a wedge.
---
Let me know what you guys think. Should i do more of these for molten core? the mechanics arent hard but no one likes feeling like they are caught with there pants down.
---
Jesus christ no. No one trying to get shit done quick is going to sit around and wipe instead of questing, grinding or farming. This sub really does live in a special little bubble of nostalgia and naivete.
---
Not sure about in classic but whenever I log onto my character on Argent Dawn-EU (rp server) there is just a different feel to the community and so many interactions you wouldn’t find on a normal or PvP server.
---
I would like to see that testing, and if it's even comparable to a real raid environment. LegacyPlayers says otherwise and so does what I've seen personally.
---
That was exactly my point, thank you 
---
As an experienced healer, I always purchased higher ranks as I needed them for healing.  I leveled as a healer, and was never behind the pack of those hitting 60.  As a skilled healer, I was never without a group, never let a group down, always went in prepared with pots and the best gear that I owned.  
---
What pisses healers off are the dps and the tanks that think they can level to 60 and immediately find groups for Scholo and Strath having skipped getting any gear since their first run through SM.  Without paying for any upgraded skills since SM.  And then cry as they are one-shot by bosses with crits.  Of course, they also point to the healer who basically empties their mana on them during trash fights.  
---
Just remember, WoW requires groups.  Prove you're an asshole, prove that you aren't skilled and/or haven't geared your toon properly, and you will find that you aren't much of a 'group' person -- and there are no dungeon finders for you to coat-tail for gear.
---
I always love it when they are in a group, telling everyone what BiS is needed, and they can't cc, can't silence, can't trap, can't FD and can't heal.  But they can tell you what you need to wear to do so.  Just wait, you'll find 'em.  They are usually standing in the fire, the poison and/or as a ranged dps -- right up against the boss.
---
Played on the biggest German classic pserver for a cpl of monthes and I can totally confirm your experience. Not only a lot of toxic idiots, but also a lot of right wing attitude across the board :-( stopped playing there because of that
---
Classic (insane mode) now unlocked
---
I actually had more people on my friend list on emerald dream and nost than I did over multiple expansions of retail. Just a bunch of friendly travellers while leveling/pvping/dungeon running. That was before private servers were 'mainstream' though, so perhaps the crowd is a little less chill.
---
this changes the whole game for me
---
World PvP isn't about fairness. PvP realms anything goes, even if its a lv 60 horde rogue ambushing low lvl in Redbridge. 
---
If u want more fairness then play on PvE realm and /duel the opposing fraction when u want to test your strength. U would be surprise how often they accept duels even when u can't talk to them.
---
\*engage boss\* "do you guys not have money?!"
---
Because every raid outside of Naxx and the later half of AQ40 is a cakewalk, and guilds are progressing through naxx with Moonkins, Ret paladins &amp; Elemental shamans in their squad. 
---
99.5% more likely, and that's of people who get to 60 and get bis gear and are still somehow able to do the single hardest raid that was possible when released and find a group of 40 who can do it too.
---
Because two groups actually just staying together and wintrading does not lead to them getting stomped into the ground repeatedly by premade dodging groups.
---
can we have the list of consumables that were classified by mandatory/hardcore/superhardcore?
---
retail trash alert bwoop bwoop
---
I'll be right there alongside you all.  I can usually make time for about 10-14 hours of gaming a week.  That consists of 2 x 3h raid sessions, 2 x 2h casual gaming nights and usually Friday/Saturday/Sunday AFK but open for gaming if the time is available.  I rarely spend more than 2 hours gaming at a time any more.  
---
Why would they need to do that?
---
^^^/s
---
Wow if classic wow needs an alpha we are in serious trouble.
---
No, color always represented the level of difficulty of completing in relation to your current level. 
---
The biggest problem is people don’t seem to know the difference between “viable” and “optional”. Any spec can be made viable through a ton of min-maxing. Every spec is more than viable it’s just a matter of convincing your raid that.
---
If vanilla servers stopped at BWL I would play them for years. I honestly feel BWL and HWL/GM was peak itemisation, the power gap beyond that was too much.
---
I'm hoping for a vanilla server that stays vanilla forever.  Level 60 cap with no TBC ever would be amazing IMO.
---
I was thinking this as well.  My thoughts range from the total amount of players on each server, and if server transfers will be offered.  Old-school was your reputation and skill was important; and I wonder how many coming from retail will understand those concepts and their importance.  You don't mind a talented player beating their chest in celebration of a boss kill and/or a great pvp battle.  It's good to have 'back and forth' on the server and/or on discord for guild rankings to a point.  It's when it becomes rude, constant, belittling and the attempt to humiliate is when enough is enough.  
---
But if you want to see what the environment is like on private servers, create an account, go to the major city, and listen to some of the world chat or join the discord of the 'better' guilds.  You might be surprised at the type of players that are out there.
---
Basically if Activision is involved in anything, be prepared for completely thoughtless random shit thrown in for the sake of saying “new content” that will undoubtedly have some sort of money purchase revolving around it just to give the multi-billion dollar publisher a little extra cash. 
---
&gt; If you think "everyone just wants to have fun" is equal to "everybody is completely fine with not clearing any raid in the foreseeable future" then I guess you're right.
---
'Not clearing any raid in the foreseeable future'?? How hard do you think Vanilla is? Even AQ40 was cleared within 24 hours of it opening on private servers; min maxing makes vanilla content trivial. People are progressing through Naxx wings with moonkins and elemental shamans in their squad. You don't need to tryhard it to clear the content, it's not like Live WoW. 
---
If you're going for speed clears and server firsts, by all means bring along a purely optimal squad. But losing some DPS and killing the boss 15 seconds slower in order to bring along a couple of cool people with good personalities who will make the raid environment more fun isn't going to stop you from clearing any raids.
---
you are just butthurt someone killed you without a chance and need to go on the reddit to complain about wpvp as a whole. pathetic.
---
typical. aka "wpvp is just ganking and griefing". whats fun about it.
---
pvp is a major motivator why you want to get a better gear, and level up to become stronger in general, so ppl which killed you before couldnt do it. also become better at your class, take proper talents, or some pieces of gear or profession, or tricks that would help you.
---
The world become dangerous and dynamic, you need to watch ou, for stronger players or groups and be ready to escape, and pick your questing area accordingly. the game enviroment become much more dynamic, eventful and fun.
---
you need to make friends and groups to fight other ppl and groups that oppose you, thats the way to interact and meet new ppl and make bonds and friendships. join a pvp guild to protect you if you get griefed. 
---
thats a fight for valuable resources, who's stronger in pvp gets to take resources from that area, or the most juicy efficient part. Its more present at 60, but even at leveling, the resource you fight for is questing mobs.
---
equal level/geared players fight most often. dunno wtf you smoking. players of different factions in general scared and try to avoid each other, if they arent actively looking for fights, then not ofc. 
---
you finally be get better gear and level and now you can dominate other players that didnt and ganked you before.
---
high level ganking on low level players doesnt happen that often, and more of a gimmick of a few bastards, thats not highlevel ppl do in general, it gives nothing and they have their own things to do.
---
if it happens call for other lvl60 to protect you, in your guild, friends, or in world chat or just yell. often higher level players kill lowbies to start a fight to aggro high level players. So thats what you suppsoe to do, call help. no go on reddit and cry how unfair and dumb wpvp is.
---
if you see a group of enemies, either make your own group or avoid them. expecting for them not to attack you when you kill "their" mobs is naive. wpvp is about area control. they also get honor. if you arent smart, have no friends, stupidly couldnt evaluate the situation and picked a wrong area to be - then you get killed for honor, what do you expect. or you get killed in general cos you are an opposite faction and this is war. other faction doesnt want you to level, to become a threat to them. 
---
by game systems, wpvp gives honor, for each you earn rank and can get gear from vendors. ppl kill whenever they can tog et honor, especially weak players when they can, thats what makes sense to do.
---
Rogue because they have an oh **** button, i.e. vanish.
---
This...  the politics of the world enter the game play of the guild, and also in /g and /w chat.  Then it's brought into the party group.  Then the tempers come out instead of discussion.  It's sad, actually.
---
Don’t private servers reset though?
---
Are rogues or hunters better in vanilla pvp? 
---
Vanilla private servers relaunch their fresh server every 2 year.
---
In all honesty, that isn't a bad idea. I'm pretty sure Blizzard don't know exactly what they will do, but running last patch for year after year isn't that great. 
---
Personally I'd hope for a relaunch, though not right after Naxx. A ton of people will take a long time for Naxx (or never do it). Also, there is a problem with just deleting all characters to relaunch. If they don't do that they need to double their server power, so that's probably not a solution.
---
Okay. On my server black rock we called it VC 
---
Its not 5gold but 100+ if you manage to sell it via loot trading
---
I assume there would also be uncertainty about Classic at Blizz. Their stocks are down and they need to look good for investors. If a 15 years old game is a big success = better than what they do now, it would be a nail into a coffin. So releasing Classic (and promoting it) is risky, strategically.
---
If you try to sell it you get blacklisted as a ninja 
---
Nost was a bit different though.  On Nost, your general chat was never spammed with political and/or sexual fantasies.  Yes, on a p server as I was leveling one night when the mods were evidently asleep, a young man who couldn't spell and had some really, really furry-type, but really BAD sexual fantasy typed it out completely in chat.  Then you had the alt-right folks who were online all day, spouting their hatred of ethic groups other than their own, but sadly, they didn't have a job and had to beg for a member of their guild to buy them a pizza for dinner.
---
That was never experienced on Nost.  But it was on several of the p-servers after Nost.  
---
As much as I hope for Classic to be successful during a long period of time, you cant compare it with private servers. Not the same one was strong for 10 years, the private servers in general are. With plenty of new one and resets.
---
Wouldnt ranged class be easier for a noob?
---
Thanks!
---
The sneakiest little sneaky sneak you ever saw.
---
I would expect some resets and new servers for classic at some point 
---
Oh, I've seen the trump stuff in barrens. Barrens chat was always pretty dumb. That will relax once you leave unless you are in a world channel I suppose. Dont assume because a few kids are attention seeking in chat that the whole server is comprised of bad people.
---
I love how you use 1/10 of 1% instead of 0.1%. 
---
&gt; people had mental breakdowns
---
Well, the same type of people that punch their screen when they loose any other game.
---
Honestly, it was hardgated behind gear more than skill required.
---
Vanilla was amazing because at the point that you got to lvl 60 you understood your class, I recommed you picking whatever you like because that's gonna give you more enjoyment long term.
---
I was only considering world PVP. I haven't played vanilla WOW in over 10 years but from memory, rogues were more dangerous. Hunters had a deadzone which could easily be abused by the other player.
---
The best pvp class would give me the most enjoyment. 
---
Been 60 for almost two weeks on a high pop private server
---
Within a few days I was recognising people and grouping with the same people
---
Private servers are also free, though.
---
Whats a deadzone?
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted. You're right.
---
&gt; Odds are they were either toxic, White, or both :y
---
And yet this post is more racist than anything they probably said
---
I played EU and saw both VC and DM
---
Not all of them. And I stick to the realms that don't.
---
No, they're obviously not. What's up with the blatant lies? 
---
I'm not getting tired of asking you to prove where I cheerlead for Blizzrad. 
---
But you can't deliver, you're miserably failing again and again every time I ask you. 
---
You're pathetic. 
---
&gt;MLPNyx
---
Because most people are narrowminded as fuck, and only the stuff they experienced account for "real vanilla". Anything else is false.
---
Interesting. Well if you won’t tell me more hopefully I can see this guide soon then!
---
Feenix stod for 10years with a consisted population of 3k, the gm/dev team sucked balls but still. For the first 8-9 years there was no Naxx either. I remember getting Horde first Sapph kill there 
---
If you can't handle your arguments being defeated by simple logic, don't use those weak arguments. 
---
It was on discord with the guild leader.  The guild leader was the one asking for the pizza because he was online all day, didn't work, hated the libs, and begged for a pizza.  
---
Sadly they are not. My father and some of his work friends were Officers there and they are pretty much in their 50s now. I told my Father about classic release and he didnt care a bit :P
---
For a hunter, it's when another player is too close to shoot and too far away to melee. They have spells/traps to escape it but it's still a major problem for them. 
---
Hilarious. Bring on that En-GB goodness.
---
You actually describe PvP players' behaviour. You see it in this subreddit all the time, telling others how PvP servers is the only way to truly play the game, how PvE is "easy mode", how PvE server players are "carebears" etc
---
Half of these icons for wow were used in wc3. I guess I was just young enough to be able to pay attention to what a picture is of? None of these posts have surprised me in the slightest.
---
Vanilla tip 1: Can't be caught with pants down if u don't wear any
---
Good guide btw keep em rolling its always good for the community 
---
My problem with melee is i had a hard time staying on top of my opponent in pvp. But maybe that will come with practice?
---
Yes you should do more! cover all classic raids each boss fights mechanics would be agreat help for peole like me that never got that chance to at the time. Great video.
---
Yeah. If only they could be as humble as us clerics.
---
&gt; Unfortunately the idiots at blizzard are also experimenting with sharding, so if they use cross realm mechanics at all the blacklisting concept will be ruined. This is the scenario I suspect Blizzard to go regardless of the entire community not wanting it.
---
And why exactly should they implement cross-realm mechanics? What is there to gain for them?
---
You start pulling a defias thief and suddenly 2 red phantom defias rogues spawn to stab you in the kidneys.
---
They are working on their communication
---
I didn't get bored cuz right after TBC came out.
---
Yeah, because those people are gearing up in 5 mans with you. Do you know the people doing aq40?
---
Very true, but it was an example. I've personally cleared Naxx with a feral and a shadow priest in the same raid. KT was downed a few weeks after the Naxx release.
---
People still play Diablo 2, and it has even less content than wow and is older. 
---
Yup, griefing sucks.
---
But you can easily avoid it by playing on a **Normal** server instead of a PvP server. 
---
That’s a good one. Clerics are known to be grubby, greedy, needy, narcissistic little scrublords. While the warrior may be a bigger diva, at least they aren’t terrible people at their core like clerics are.
---
Exactly, plus all you had to do was shift click someone's name and see their level to know which dungeon they meant.
---
I actually did do dungeons, they were fine I guess. There is a difference between lore and story. 
---
Anyone kind of wishing for BC servers and WOTLK as well?
---
    Character_Level &lt;= Quest_Level +  5 : Quest_XP = (100 %) or Full_Quest_XP
---
Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  6 : Quest_XP = ( 80 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.8 / 5) * 5
---
Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  7 : Quest_XP = ( 60 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.6 / 5) * 5
---
Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  8 : Quest_XP = ( 40 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.4 / 5) * 5
---
Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  9 : Quest_XP = ( 20 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.2 / 5) * 5
---
Character_Level &gt;= Quest_Level + 10 : Quest_XP = ( 10 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.1 / 5) * 5
---
I doubt you will interact with any of those people. That being said a fair amount of private server players have that elitist mind set because they know what they are doing and they have been practicing for classic wow for years. Most of them will have already established guilds so they probably won't interact with you. Also with the influx of players at the start of classic wow those toxic players will be a small minority of players. Those players will have to become less toxic to fit Blizzards guidelines, because accounts aren't going to be free anymore. But the number one reason why you don't have to worry about them is you don't have to play with them... it's a MMO play with the people you choose. 
---
Slowing poisons or enchants help with that.
---
Naxx is not hard
---
Fake news! Only quests that are below or equal to level 10 give the same amount of experience independent of level. Orange or red quests don't give more experience than yellow ones, but if the player is more than five levels higher than the quest, the reward starts scaling down. [Source](http://vanilla-wow.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_point#Quest_XP).
---
If it's a pay to win server you'll find most toxic players are those who have wrecked their bank accounts for high end gear and then rage at "noobs" for not being as good as them and gearing the proper way.
---
I do however find a lot of people who played actual vanilla to be toxic, despite how much they preach about the community was better, they use the "I played vanilla" card constantly as an excuse to act like they're better than others.
---
It does. PVP is a bit rock/paper/scissors. Every class is going to have a difficult match-up. And some classes scale better with gear than others. A decked out warrior with 8000hp+ is scary. 
---
And previously Blizzard were owned by Vivendi since 1998. So don't we have to credit Blizzard for WC3 and early WoW but Vivendi?
---
It does solve the problem [for actiblizz], because now they can give an automated standard answer to all loot related questions. 
---
What do u think are the top 2 or 3 pvp classes? 
---
Icons to me were always cool but never actually thought about them to realize what they were 
---
Well AQ isn't out yet on this server, and within a few days of hitting 60 I was filling the last spot in a zg pug, within a week I'd killed Rag and Nef
---
I see the same people leading pug raids and the same people joining
---
I've been playing on private servers from 2012 to now and I havnt has this much fun playing WoW since actual vanilla times, and that does include the community. The community on private servers is MILES ahead of retail. That being said, there will be toxic players in every community.
---
There have been several icons I've misinterpreted, but this one is not one of them. How can that possibly be anything else?
---
Sounds like Hubbard fits u perfect
---
I think I'd probably kill myself if I only had 1 hour a day to do what I want. No money, status or family is worth deleting my free time.
---
I feel like a lot of the retail fanboys who post here are toxic; they still don’t understand Activi$ion is in control and has been pushing the game we love further and further away from its roots for the past decade. 
---
In greens/blues, mage is best. Their only weakness is warlocks and shadow priests. 
---
In higher end gear, warriors, rogues, warlocks and shadow priests.
---
Less than 2 years. The first wave of nostalgic/new players will leave in months.
---
This is Mythic raiding right now. Don’t believe me? Go kill Kil’jaeden on mythic in TOS  right now (raid from Legion). It’s board line impossible. 
---
My buddy is on Nost and raided mythic in Legion/BFA. He stated Naxx is the same difficulty as mythic raiding of today. 
---
Hell even some Mythic raids have more wipes/attempts on certain bosses than Naxx did in Vanilla. (Keep in mind players are better now too!)
---
The difference is in Vanilla, there’s no other source to farm gear for Naxx, like M+. So it will take longer to clear, unless everyone is pre-Naxx Bis.  
---
Mythic raiding may actually be harder to clear than Naxx overall. 
---
Incoming downvotes from private sever fan boys/purists that never raided Mythic successfully for multiple tiers. 
---
True
---
I think that misconception just stems from the fact that people would count their rewarded XP by how much they fill one of the little segments in the UI. Higher levels require more XP, and so green quests don't give as much relative to that, and fill less of a segment.
---
I think Naxxramas will be less restrictive than you imagine. If Classic goes on indefinitely, many people we accumulate loads of gear that will help make the mechanics of the raid a little bit less soul-crushing. The biggest barrier to entry at that point would likely be if you have the time to commit to the progression in the long term, the raid in the short time, and finding the 39 others to do it with you.
---
Not to say it'll be easy by any stretch, but we'll definitely see far higher clear rates than in retail Naxxramas.
---
Every serious guild will have a dedicated shadow priest. If they don't, that guild clearly doesn't know wtf they're doing. That shadow weaving holy spec is horrible
---
How’d you do the movements of your icons? I’d like to know for current content (bfa) and strategizing for my guilds raids? I don’t wanna do guides per say just help my guild. And thanks for this video! 
---
It's not that hard anymore though. Especially the first couple of bosses. My guess is that there will be a ton of guilds who can't get past Twin Emperors, or even to them because of the ridiculous trash. They will be able to clear through most of the first-wing bosses in Naxx and maybe all of Spider wing if their priests and druids are up for the challenge. 
---
One thing that really prevented mid- and lower-tier guilds from progressing was the prolific recruitment by the top-tier guilds. So many guilds suddenly lost their top tanks to 4H progressing guilds or their top healers and dps in general. I doubt this will be as big on Classic. We know from the start that we need 6 tanks with the set bonus and ZG trinket. We also don't funnel all gear to one player (except tanks) which made them very desirable back in vanilla and prone to being sniped by the big guys.
---
As to how many will actually see KT drop, well it will obviously be more than during vanilla. If you are serious enough about the game you will see him dead eventually. The hardest part is the amount of consumes your guild needs to farm. Also, people can host their own private servers and practice the bosses there without losing gold in the real game. 
---
Not sure about that in my mind there is no way to make balance druids viable in raids the kit is simply not strong enuf. You might convince a raid to bring a enhancement shaman for nightfall buffs but it will be hard. But elemental is going to be harder. Not sure about paladins you can use prot paladin for some trash pulls where you aoe but on bosses? And a ret paladin?
---
I wouldn't play BfA if Blizzard payed me 15usd/month...
---
Just some simple animation and key frame changes in the editing software. I will say that the (albeit simple) animations took the most of my time in making the video, the next was asset collection. Music script and voice were the easy parts for me.
---
You mind telling me the editing software? Also I just subbed to your channel for more videos. Can’t wait to be adventuring in the good ol Classic Azeroth! Thank you 😊 
---
There are addons that show every quest on the map and keeps track of which you've done. However we have no idea how addons will work on classic so we'll have to wait and see on that one I guess.
---
Vegas movie studio 15 premium. I will say its not cheap, the only reason i bought it, was that it was on sale. A little research and im sure you will find an editor for you, just make sure you know what your getting yourself into. As an ameteur editor this took nearly 20 hours to make with a "learn as i go" style to it.
---
Translation: I like to act *real* shitty online and fucking *hate* it when people call me on my bullshit.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if they will go the microtransactions way eventually and completely obliterate classic WoW. But if they do this their market will drop even more. I honestly want to see blizzard/activision bleed to death.
---
How old are you? Priorities change over time. 
---
Sounds awesome, any requirements on RP experience?
---
If we don't count the "tourists" who will leave before hitting 30, 90% sounds reasonable. 
---
I know what you mean, but looking for tank and healer is pretty much fucked, I would definitely go with the team that was ready to go.
---
Very good guide- I love these types of simple and straight forward guides. Its the opposite of this awful Fatboss guides that are 30 minutes for each boss
---
I kinda think there is, I played P servers for a bit, you kinda always have at the back of your mind this server could go down next week. As much as I enjoy classic, I never got as invested in private servers even though I enjoyed myself.
---
While the amount of exp is the same, it's a higher % to next level, so I think your okay to keep on cheeting the system :)
---
People will get bored of Classic because of how the game is designed.  PvP will be the only thing the game will still be played for 5 years in.
---
I had 2 experiences with loot problems in vanilla over the duration of beta-TBC.  Both were in MC and the raid leader butter fingered the master loot and gave something like priest shoulders to a druid or something stupid.  GM tickets fixed it eventually.  Most likely some servers were worse or something than others.  I also did a lot of friends/guild groups so ymmv.
---
This.
---
They don't want to release any information until they have some kind of beta, because we are going to take that bit of information and analyze it to the core
---
Then why are people obsessed with doing another factions quests for rep right from the start instead of coming back to them? Seriously asking, I don't know the answer.
---
Warriors needed.
---
You know i can appreciate the fatboss guys. But when i played retail, specifcially legion in this case i would look to the guides done by LOS gaming;2 minute tips and i loved them cause i would forget what actually happened during a fight from one week to the next. I didnt need each and every little min max but for a mythic level. Just a nice guideline for the flow of the fight.
---
I don't miss it, since I don't play the new WoW.
---
Oh my god. Lol dude you’re awesome for this then! 
---
I think more will be at Naxx than ever due to the knowledge we have now and the resources at hand.
---
They removed most of the dungeon and made it so that you can no longer get lost. It's just a tunnel to go through.
---
I hear far more PvE players claim they see that, than PvP players actually saying it.
---
It doesnt matter which dungeon you do. The main reward is that you always get a bag with a blue item with random stats upon completion. The reward depend on your level as far as I know. Ring, Amulet, Bracer, etc.
---
We raided with no consumables in vanilla and got to the four horsemen, I doubt that Classic will be harder, if anything it'll be easier because of 1.12. What stopped us was lack of tanks, not lack of consumables.
---
We did however require you to enchant your gear. 
---
Almost 30. I don't think it will change, also I don't think it will be necessary to complete end your life to just spawn offspring. Several of my friends have got kids by now and they all have time to play games. Not as much as I have but that's to be expected. Certainly more than a measly 1 hour a day. That seems to be more common in the US where people work themselves to death just to sustain themselves. Glad I wasn't born there. 
---
This a classic reply from a 20 year old 
---
Tell that to all the racists, bigots, nazis, auhtoritarian suckers.
---
A few months ago, it came out that most PvP guilds, the ones with all the rankers, are pretty much a cesspool of racism, homophobia and what not. I don't remember his name, but one of the more popular streamers talked about it, as he was part of one of those guilds. According to him, that part of the ommunity is pretty much nothing but toxic, and if you want to rank, you either silently put up with it, or you don't join those guilds and say goodbye to your ranking dreams, or you slowly start to become just like the rest of them.
---
That's toxicity. And private servers are sadly full of it. For the most part, the people on those servers will be pleasant, normal people. But the vocal minority spamming world chat is everything but. They are nothing but assholes, bad trolls and generally unpleasant people.
---
That's one reason I look forward to Classic, to be able to play the game without having people shout in chat how awesome nazis are and that LGBT people deserve to die. Under Blizzard, I don't think shit like that is going to fly, and I'm very happy about it. Of course, it's selfish, but I just don't want to play with assholes and nazis. They are whats wrong with this world, and I refuse to help them have fun in any way if they can't act like normal people and keep their bigotted shit to themselves.
---
Sure, but a lot of players would play just because it is free.
---
If the endgame is so good, why would you want to start all over again every 6 month?
---
The elite giants drop rare blue dragonscale patterns. Also the hunter quest at level 50 starts there. 
---
Quality post that sums up the issue but is ling so very few will read.
---
Working 40-60 hours a week with a girlfriend and going to the gym after work I got to 60 in approx 2 and a halve months. This was my first time leveling a vanilla toon and had your standard addons/guides to help me level.
---
It does take much longer than retail, but if your devoting an hour or two a day and possibly more on weekends you can easily be 60 within 3 months
---
Same, I thought it was a holy foot, similar to the visual effect that Res had.
---
The best way to add these would be to have a hearthstone game load when sitting at specific tables in inns to link the games. 
---
Then add these as legendary cards in an upcoming release.
---
In games like Ultima Online, PvP was thrilling, because if you die, people could loot everything you had. 
---
In Meridian59, everytime you died in PvP or PvE, you would loose skills and have to lvl them up again. There were Guilds that would patrol areas and try to protect other people from Player Killers. That is what I call deep social interaction.
---
In Aion, if you had a high-rank, you could transform into a powerful being, but if you got killed by someone with a significant lower PvP Rank, you could loose it all. The best crafting resources are in PvP areas. Now that's a game were Open World PvP was tons of fun.
---
For me, there is nothing fun or thrilling walking over to the spirit healer in WoW classic. I rather do BG, because at least there is something at stake here, you could loose the match. That is better than nothing.
---
And this is a classic reply from someone who wish they had the time to do what they like instead of slaving away at the office then get home to ungrateful kids and a wife obsessed with blowing your hard-earned cash on fancy handbags and trips to whole foods, yet still believe that they have the moral high ground because giving up your life for kids and consumerism is the societal norm.
---
The one mod I'd support for Naxx is a change to the Horsemen.  Modify the mechanics to require mage tanking for some of them, or a buff that makes healing spells do damage them so the holy pallies in the group can tank them, or something.
---
also the satyrs drop felcloth, and are mixed in with high elves. together you can get a bunch of runecloth/mageweave to make bandages/AH. There is also a naga rare spawn not too far from there that often dropped things like the hanzo sword i think. The questing is mostly limited to the southwest of the zone though. Then it's just a bunch of random mobs, the hydraxxian waterlords, and azurgos
---
One you pay for, and that creates the illusion of importance. 
---
We had a Moonkin in Naxxramas. But I can't tell you if the player was just determent enough with the Raid-Leaders. Or if it had something to do with Moonkins being viable. I have 0 Data. As I Rogue I pretty much didn't care at the time.
---
I just know we got fucked pretty hard with a Razuvious fight, because our Holy Priests didn't have any hit gear. The guy who played Shadow sometimes, was King of the Hill.
---
This is the truth. I came from eq. Raided all through vanilla but never been in naxx because our guild could not even clear aq40. We were not idiots or crap, we had sever firsts in BWL and ZG.  
---
Aq40 and naxx will be the playground for 10% of players at most
---
Which is an illusion, because after all they are bytes stored in some computer outside your reach.
---
It’s a divide between autumn-like bliss and a huge effin forest. 
---
It's basically an half-done zone. They overhauled it in the Cataclysm and made it useful.  
---
Make vids now. A huge wave of viewers will watch in the coming months. 
---
It's for this reason that over-leveling a zone is the best way to level a warrior. Still get max quest xp, and you can kill a few mobs in a row before needing to stop and catch your breath.
---
tryhard private server weirdo editing the pixel. 
---
Chance to stun is 1 subtract the chance not to stun, which is 0.64 to the power 3, or 0.26. Thus, the chance to stun is 74%. If you run 5 warlocks this would only increase to 90% due to DR.
---
&gt;The only difference is that you need to create a GM ticket to transfer the item and say you mistakenly rolled on the item.
---
Stop saying this. It just isnt true. When you have to wait several days before your ticket is answered and the loot is handed over, the majority just wont bother doing it. It also ties up your ticket so you can only do it once every few days instead of loot trading which would enable you to do this kind of sleezy behaviour multiple times per dungeon in multiple dungeons each day.
---
you could do with only; rend(rank 1, kinda optional for pvp since the duration increases)), Shield bash(rank 1), revenge(rank1), demo shout(rank 1), taunt, mocking blow(rank 1), pummel(rank 1), intercept(rank 1)
---
battle shout(max rank), Sunder armor(max rank, eh sorta optional normally but you wanted to tank aswel), Heroic strike(optional to increase after 36 when u get ww which is a betterish rage dump often, nice threat), Mortal strike or bloodthirst(max rank), sweeps/deathwish, hamstring(max rank).
---
sth lik
---
&gt; 1 active one is enough.
---
&gt;use your brain
---
Yeah leveling is kind of bad in Classic. The game truly starts for me at lvl 60. I hope to be done with this repetitive grind as quick as possible.
---
I agree with you. I think the Classic servers will have to progress to TBC eventually.
---
That was an epic dungeon, that's sad to hear.
---
That's why you getting rid of the lowest level quests and that's why addons that can at least show you the quests levels are handy. 
---
&gt; I like to think WoW meta was still very young back then. Did we even have near the amount of theorycrafting and datamining we do now?
---
Both yes and no. There was plenty of theorycrafting in Classic, but it was in-guild theorycrafting a lot of the time. Elitist Jerks, sims, Discord, Icy-Veins? No. It happened on guilds respective forums, where you needed to log in to view the content wasn't uncommon.
---
Haha well the only thing stopping me is time and uncertainty of intrest. Lots of people have done guides that i felt were too wordy and long or were too gnitty gritty, treating it like retail levels of complex. And thats fine, they are very well detailed guides  that take a lot of effort but i feel like most fights dont require that to still down.
---
No brain? The point is you will never know the group did this unless you are idiots and roll on items that clearly have no use for you. You cant call someone out for being a ninja if you have no idea the item got traded in the first place.
---
What sounds easier to you?
---
Make a ticket and wait a day or two for the GM to respond and hope the GM transfer the item to the player of your choice instead of the second highest roller?
---
Or..
---
Need 10 items each day in various different groups and trade everything to your friend without anyone having any way of knowing.
---
Is it possibly to go a hybrid like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxibbVMhZxfez0xo
---
   
---
This would utilize melee white damage, super buffing a melee group and chain healing when needed. Priority is healing but when you're not, you could auto?   
---
Would there be a place for a build like this?
---
This post and the response to it really demonstrates the poor attitude and utter ignorance of this sub's userbase.
---
Yikes look at all these insecure people! At first it was “it’s not gonna happen you think you do but you don’t.” Then when it was announced, they resorted to “nobody will play it.” After realizing just how popular the Classic movement is (thanks to the last two Blizzcon), we have “it’ll be sooo boring people will quit.” 
---
Fucking hilarious seeing all these people have a mental breakdown over Classic.
---
What you describe is not a real scenario. It may happen that groups reserve Dal'Rends, but they will never reserve BOTH of the weapons, because they still want to actually attract people to fill up the raid. Most reserve groups reserve EITHER the mainhand OR the offhand one at a time until they have the set.
---
However if the Mainhand happens to drop while they have reserved the Offhand, they can still have all their friends need on it to trade it over to whoever made the group, even though they have better weapons.
---
Azshara is the absolute worst zone in the entirety of Vanilla. This is the reason the devs put as little content there as they could - to discourage players from going there.
---
This is 100% true fact taken from interviews with the Vanilla WoW devs.
---
The biggest issue is the geography.
---
It is the most common most hated zone.
---
Somebody has no idea why Naxx was so incredibly “difficult” back then. 
---
&gt;Most ubrs groups in classic, on blackrock USA, used  master looter, FYI.
---
How exactly does master looter make any difference? Presumably loot trading will be there to fix master looter mistakes as well (otherwise there would be little point to implementing it)
---
The only difference with master loot enabled is that instead of the warrior and his 3 friends all hitting need on the item, they will all type /roll instead.
---
&gt;I still feel like
---
Your feelings are wrong. I, and many others, have experienced it and always have said the same thing. It instantly kills the social aspect of PvP.
---
But it's so beautiful and quaint. Has to be a decent place to fish right? Or at least be alone a get a decent from from something
---
And for other people, having Flying Mounts wont affect their core gameplay experience. For others, having LFR wont affect their core gameplay experience.
---
As long as a change affect the core gameplay experience for *somebody,* that change should never be implemented to classic.
---
stack the fuck out of spirit to reduce recovery time.
---
Embrace the shadow 
---
In a positive way? How would you feel if you join a dungeon group and turns out the 4 other players are all good friends and they decided to all roll need on gear that at least one of them want?   
---
What is gonna happen is that you now have 1 chance out of 5 to get whatever you need from the dungeon against 4/5 chance NOT to get the item, compared to 1/2 chance which is what the odds should be in Vanilla when 2 players needs the same piece of gear.   
---
Do you really want to see players who doesn't need an item that drop to actually click the need button, therefore giving you less chances at getting whatever you want?    
---
On the opposite side, it now makes the game a whole lot easier for groups that needs on everything and trade the gear to each other, now you'll be able to get your full pre-raid BiS set in maybe a couple of days at worst, compared to the "Blizzlike" version which in general takes you maybe about a week if not more.   
---
There is most likely other side effects that I'm not thinking about, but you can be certain that implementing this feature will change other things that were not originally intended, such as what I just explained.
---
Private server community disagree. People are still the same as 15 years ago. The difference is the kind of players and the acceptable behaviour of those players are shaped by the games they play and how those games work.
---
The argument that gamers are different is easily disproven by private servers where ninjalooting is very much shunned, and blacklists are public on reddit.
---
Lots of other FTP games that aren’t 15 years old if you’re just a broke young sperg looking for a game to play. 
---
Lack of culture. VC has to be hands down the most sincere lack of culture I could imagine. No one in Westfall is going to be doing fucking dire maul
---
&gt;Loot trading will effect things in a very positive way, since GMs won't manually be restoring our items ever again.
---
Source: You in another comment from the same post.
---
That isn't very vanilla either. Seems like you're making changes to the game.
---
You cant identify them, and that is the issue people dont seem to grasp. Technically you could accomplish the same thing in Vanilla through a ticket, but the amount of time that would take, and the fact you could only do it once until your ticket got answered kept the majority from doing it.
---
Loot trading would make this process so easy, and with no way to identify who the loot was traded to, you would be downright stupid not to take advantage of this, which leads to a really toxic community.
---
It's decent. Can weapon swap to cancel proc if needed, no?
---
Also helps that a large chunk of the playerbase saw it in Wrath as well so they'll be semi-familiar with it, whether that translates to anything in 40 man vanilla Naxx I don't know but it's definitely not going to hurt.
---
I like to imagine players skills have greatly improved after playing for 15 years too.
---
Great piece of content, :noobert: !
---
:^) just seeing how much other people like it. Might do mc if i find the time
---
That would depend on the GM. My experience back in the day is that GM's had a lot of leeway in how they chose to respond to tickets. The classic example is when you vendor a soulbound BoE item. Ticket the GM to have it restored. If the item comes back Soulbound, just vendor it and try again. Would not take long before you found a GM that just send you the item in the tradable state.
---
Don't play on a pvp ruleset server. Problem solved!
---
Servers dont "reset". They open fresh and merge when they are at same patch again.
---
I mean. You’ll probably be downvoted to hell but I’m with you. My s/o respects my time I dedicate to my team and the time I need to practice to stay competitive in the game I play. And because of that, I try and make time for her as well any time I can since she does for me. 
---
1) Some class quests
---
2) Azuregos
---
3) Nagas near the water are the HIGHEST xp/hour attainable by decently quick farming classes from late forties to early/mid fifties
---
My dream is they announce Classic Burning Crusade.
---
You are given a chance to transfer your character to a BC realm or continue with Classic.  They keep classic going and have a seperate BC classic going as well.
---
I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.  If classic brings in a shit-ton of subs, if they aren't adding content except for the raids (no clue how much of those are ready or if they stagger release), then it's not unimaginable that they start on doing the same for BC.
---
BC/Wrath were the highlights and highest points of Wow, so it makes sense they would want to milk that for money.
---
I hope so.  Now that classic is coming, a BC realm seems possible and might be the greatest thing ever.
---
Anything else? Stonescale fishing? Anything I can milk out of having some peace and quiet?
---
That's just a PVP server with 2 rogue's ganking.
---
That's already there.
---
Setting you to ignore, since you're obviously not worth conversing with.
---
Of course I have around 4-5 hours of freetime a day but I have to go shopping, do the laundry, eat and stuff. That's why my dedicated game time gets shorter.
---
Loatheb with no consumes hmm
---
Nice and simple, It reminds of those old fatboss 1min raid guides.
---
They were really popular.
---
Guides are great, I just always say don’t underestimate the joy of going into the boss the first time blind.
---
So you havent played feral dps at all and especially not as your main character, putting all the effort to push it to the limits? Also, I would like to hear some kind of basis for the claim that they are horseshit. 
---
I have done both theorycrafting and tests as well as played in high-end guilds as a feral dps and it is impossible to remove the fact that I am still in top30 average dps in comparison to all the rogues on the most popular classic server. 
---
The main problem why you don't see that many ferals with high parses is that they are not taken in most of the top guilds due to most of the people still being hesitant on taking them, as well as having difficulties to find feral players that actually put the time and effort to playing it well.
---
What more, are you talking about AQ40 and casters being outdpsed by feral or what? Because what I mentioned is early content meaning MC &amp; BWL, which is the point where casters have pretty much 0 spell hit and they do half the dmg of melee.
---
&gt;98% of the time, you will have a decent group composition with 1 cloth, 1 leather, 1 mail, and 1 plate, with 1 duplicate class.
---
Thats way too ignorant of how Vanilla works. There's too much overlap between gear for different classes and specs for this to be true. There are leather items that are best in slot for warriors, feral, rogue, retpala, hunter (truestrike f.ex). There are also spellpower gear that are best in slot for all healer (Briarwood Reed) and you have healing trinkets (Mindtap) that are very useful for Shadow Priests, as well as Mail items that are great for tanking but not so much for DPS.
---
It's more common than not that you will have multiple people in a group that could reasonably use the item. You just wont ever know if they have a better item in their bag or bank, and you cannot call them out if they need on behalf of their friend.
---
There will and always have been toxic players.
---
I think a large amount of them are in for a rude awakening when suddenly your rep with the server matters and you can't just queue mindlessly for stuff.
---
Dreamfoil.
---
I found that is fun but at the same time, if you dont know what could come kill you at any second (especially if your a clothy!) im almost to afraid to commit to a hard casted spell lmao
---
YouTube shedo feral. He goes over his spec in his videos
---
\*Doesn't read quest text\*  
---
There's no story!
---
Combat swords is alright. No prep hurts but having decent gear from raiding makes up for it sonewhat. I was combat daggers which I do not recommend. Combat swords can farm well, and worst case scenario you can ninja skin devilsaurs or pickpocket brd.
---
Life as a rogue is not difficult.
---
Now I'm hearing the [Ashenvale music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78xB_GqLwPY) in my head and the nostalgia is hitting me really hard.
---
ah i see. the good old "classic contrary to private servers, will die because people have to pay $10 a month" argument. yeah... are there people that realy believe that?
---
apart from that that money includes retail so anyone that plays that has classic included anyways.
---
I never spend much time there but I like killing Naga for some reason.
---
Because it was typically the people on the lower faction side that left, creating a higher discrepancy on that server.  But that was used as a messure to address low pop servers as opposed to faction imbalanced servers.  If you tried to apply it to faction imbalance, you'd still see the lower faction move off, but then the higher would probably stay.  Why leave if your side dominates.
---
My hope is that they leave anything cross-realm the hell out of Classic, and let the servers balance out naturally.  Or least I think they world.
---
It's not even that the priest wants it for the spirit. Items with spellhit is the most important kind of gear you can equip when you go into Naxx and is tasked with mindcontrolling adds on Instructor. A resisted (missed) Mind Control can easily wipe the raid.
---
In your example, both the mage, warlock and the priest would be right in needing the neck, but if the priest had the item already in his bank you could never tell.
---
Well if this is something you enjoy, now is the best time to get things done. Happened to me when Albion came out and actually got picked up by them to make guilds. That wouldn't happen with blizzard, but the community is massive and you'd get loads of views from the new people that want to learn the old raids like myself. 
---
Fast and simple is what we need for videos. If we need in-depth details, we can read about it. 
---
Combat definitely wasn’t the best pvp spec. I know because that was my main in vanilla and that was my spec. I just loved swords. You don’t get the burst damage like you do in assassination. You get better sustained damage for sure but that isn’t really a strength in pvp. I always enjoyed a good bladefurry and adrenaline rush in a big horde of people. 
---
Although I did tend to be able to stand my own against warriors more toe to toe like rather than constantly stunning-running away-restealthing and reatunning. 
---
The better pvp spec was something like 30ish assassination- a few in combat and the rest in sub. You basically wanted to get cold blooded and  the preparation skill for dagger rogues. 
---
I absolutely love that every comment in here is  "X is the best bracket" with a list of reasons.
---
Fuck me I cannot wait to get back into classic.  I had a twink at 39 for a while, can't remember what class but I got bored and kept leveling him pretty quick.
---
Might try it this time later on
---
Think I just reached my limit of reading the word 'toxic'.
---
But then you still have the problem of the guilds that are forming now possibly being split up because the server hit cap before they all got characters made, which I guess you could chalk up to natural selection.  Maybe if it were a pop cap on accounts being online it might work.  Meaning don't max out the total population, just the population that can be online at the same time?  Might be a good way to go about it.
---
Was reminiscing on vanilla pvp videos. This is one of my favorites,and was curious about some of y’alls favorite vanilla pvp videos. 
---
If you watch his videos and comments, farming pummelers for a week only takes him 1 hour. Yes the consumables can be a bit of work but from his exp he said the farming is only marginally above that of a rogue.   
---
If you practice powershifting on a instant 60 server its really not that bad. You are only pressing shred and fbite besides the shifting. After 20min or so I got the hang of it, the hardest part is when omen procs it can throw you off.   
---
I like it because playing shadow priest in legion was so intense, way harder than a feral in vanilla imo. I feel like I'd get so bored in vanilla as any other dps besides warrior. 
---
You see them they can't be that sneaky
---
I'm planning on skipping Whirlwind too, especially because I'm planning on hitting 60 within the first 3-4 weeks. Going to be tough to get help and by the time you're high enough level for the axe you could just get the Ravager from SM (assuming you're planning on running SM, which I am at least once or twice because it has several pieces which will last a long time). Worst case a level 40-41 green is just as good.
---
I don't think I would hold it against a feral druid to not use these on the majority of fights because an individual persons DPS does not really matter a lot of the time.  Exceptions obviously on progression content where you are close (maybe Rag?) and obviously on something like Vael/Huhu/Patch.  Not a lot of benefit to chain pop it on Magmadar or most MC/BWL bosses.  *shrug*
---
So then they dont shuffle loot around. I would much rather they flat out refuse to restore loot, and instead add an extra confirmation "Are you sure you want to Need this item", over adding loot trading.
---
Might have been an US thing. Cenarius-US def called it VC back in the day. 
---
You have completed the game and (probably) geared up your first character. Nice!  
---
8 more characters to go.
---
On the other hand millions of people use battle.net client daily, so it would get a lot more exposure, especially since the subscriptions of retail and classic will be tied together. But the whole dead game is big meme these days where if you aren't the biggest game in some way people call it dead game. For example you hear people calling fortnite dead game, even that its absolutely huge atm and starcraft has had good amount of players for years and years now and people keep calling it dead game.
---
It's actually true. 10 bucks a month is nothing for me but I have friends that prefer to play on any private server because it's free, regardless of the version. Those are called casual players, they might pay for a game but not for a subscription.
---
I don't think Classic will die in 2 years but if there's is no new content whatsoever, which is fine, they'll need to change the model because logic reasons.
---
&gt;How common is this really going to be?  Show me a group of 4 people running this dungeon over and over to do this in a pug.
---
If you dont know shit about Vanilla you should not be talking so boldly.
---
There are countless reasons to run dungeons even when you dont need actual blue drops from there.
---
In the case of Truestrike, even when you have it you can just put on some other worse shoulders and run the dungeon with your friend who needs it. The dungeon can still drop Feltriker, Chromatic Carapace, Finkle's Skinner, Recipe: Flask of the Titans, Ace of Beasts and Pristine Hide of the Beast. All of those are highly sought after items. Some of those in the case of the flask recipe, ace and pristine hide can sell for over 1000g.
---
You do that. By today's standards, naxx is far from hard and you'd probably have to be delusional to think otherwise.
---
You sound truly enlightened good sir I hope you have a good day *tips fedora*
---
I could do 10 hours on weekends that's for sure :D.
---
First of all guys, the ones in this post who are writing that we know everything except sharding/loot trading are either stupid or just dont care about the game to be competent to take part in this discussion.
---
As for the beta, it should be out by now. I think we all remember how the "beta" at Blizzcon was. 6 months before the game is set to release, the game should be very close to finished so they can work on minor bugs and just double checking that everything is ok. If we get beta 1 month before release then I'm gonna be very worried.
---
My biggest suggestion to people is NEVER join a "Loot council" guild in Classic (Or any MMORPG for that matter). Because unless you are one of the few people doing EVERYTHING including PVP that has nothing to do with raiding you will practically be a second class citizen. Only fair way to handle gear in the case of 40 man raiding is DKP.
---
Really? There's a ton of toxic twats out there who spend their lives min maxing and get salty if you slow their URBS run by 1 minute. 
---
So looking at the list of skills that you will have access before L40, skills between level 1 and 38; Skip Slam completely. Only Rank 1 Thunder Clap, Cleave, Demoralizing Shout and Revenge. Execute also could be left at rank 1, because at 30 you get Sweeping Strikes. At low levels you have some serious rage problems and Rend is so much better for damage than Heroic Strike. Rends only costs 10 rage, Heroic Strike says 15 rage on the tooltip, but it's true cost is the 15 rage + the rage you would have generated from the auto attack. Rank 4 Heroic Strike costs something like 35s, so it's not the end of the world to also train it. Sunder Armor could also be left to rank 2 to save some money.
---
I want to roll horde in classic and I’m torn between the nature resistance and HP of Tauren and Axe spec and chance for stuns to miss of Orc. I’d like to tank mostly, so are both choices reasonable? Is there a CLEAR preference in your mind? People seem to have very polarizing opinions on the topic but I wonder how much is a mountain being made out of a molehill. 
---
Bonebiter seems like the best option, is it alliance only? What would be the hordes best option?
---
Nothing that a boat ride between both tips (think Feathermoon - Feralas mainland) and one questhub located at either landing wouldn't have solved.
---
In any case even in its vanilla state I love it. To me it's a net positive that a few areas actually feel like a frontier.
---
One of the good things about Azshara is that very few people are ever there due to the lack of quests. If you just want to grind in peace it’s a decent place to do it. Also there are a good mix of targets, including low armour targets.
---
Oh I’m sorry I thought recreating a gaming experience from 14 years ago had something to do with trading loot to your friends because we all behave like children and nothing to do with “nostalgia” or and actual fair gameplay that we experienced back then. 
---
My bad. 
---
I guess I should just avoid sharing my opinion when something is inevitable because you’ve determined how the world should work for everyone. 
---
I’ll just say this, if classic dies at some point it sure as hell won’t be over 10 bucks.
---
I mean, yeah? That's exactly what's happened on every vanilla pserver is existence. 
---
You never know until they announce something! :P
---
Do you get sent to this NPC by another quest or do you have to proactively scout it out? Hunter lvl 50 quest that is
---
I certainly remember calling it VC on US-Zuluhed
---
I don't get why you even care what retail players say. Just be happy to play your game and have fun instead of wasting your time constantly debating.
---
I would be curious to learn more about what beginner attrition is like in MMOs. It seems to be discussed as a legacy server phenomenon but anecdotally I've dropped out of so many brand new MMOs within first week, if even that.
---
I once heard that 5% of players who bought Baldur's Gates 2 Enhanced Edition ever complete so much as the intro chapter.
---
full t3 - thats when the real game starts
---
Lol it’s just a photo from google that I found while searching classic wow stuff! You’re telling me you’ve never played a private server? 
---
1.12 had the 16 debuff slots did it not? so I don't see how that is a slippery slope, if you want 1.12 you want 16 debuff slots.
---
I do read them. Those are called side quests dumb dumb.
---
The hunter trainer gives the quest. The chain ends at Sunken Temple and gives a blue spear or trinket. 
---
I think the two key differences are that when you are playing on a PS, you are basically always playing under the assumption that you could vanish with the snap of someones fingers, so your character has inherently less value. It's basically like, "well, I could be gone at any second so i'll just do whatever because it probably will have no consequences".
---
On top of that, it is my understanding that some PS allow you to transfer your character data. So you can be a huge dick and then just decide, "i'll start fresh elsewhere" and ask the new PS to incorporate your data. Almost like a realm transfer in WoW, except it can be done for free.
---
All in all, the external control mechanisms that will exist in classic are sure to make people a bit more polite at the very least.
---
This is completely wrong...every level a quest is grey youse lose 20% base reputation up to 80%.
---
When I was 11 I legitimately believed that to get better pelts in EQ you couldn't use weapons, and so I rolled a monk to punch for pelts.  To be fair that was before google.
---
I am about to make my first character and I was planning to do a horse furry warrior, do the races make a big difference or should I just go with what I think looks the coolest?
---
"Retailers be like"
---
Can we please remove trash like this?

The nightsong music and warsong blended in one Zone for ashenvale still gives me chills. Such greatness.

Of course that is a good point lol

^  Misuses words so they have no meaning
---
Classic flight paths were a perfect addition to the game. They could be a break or just a scenic way to take everything in. 
---
Oh shit I missed this. Thanks for the link. Will take down post 
---
This was posted less than 24 hours ago and no additional discussion was presented by the OP, so this is being removed as a repost (Rule #7).
---
You people have a poor concept of time.  Private servers get shut down all the time, and none have had a long standing run with hundreds of thousands willing to invest time into them.  Blizzards approved private server will in fact get very boring 5 years in.  This is because WoW has always been designed to progress forward and never to look back.
---
Take Project 1999 for example.  Still going strong(ish for EQ).  This is because there is an economy and items you loot in low level areas still sell for decent amounts of money.  This is also because raiding is extremely difficult to break into, and because leveling to 60 takes months.  Yes months.  Good fucking luck Joana.  Soloing to max level is no joke.  
---
This brings about some bad things.  The server needs a hard reset because every level 10 has 300,000 platinum worth of twink items and all of the zones become trivial (though you can still die, and dying in EQ takes away experience and significant time for corpse runs).  
---
Wow doesn't face any of these issues.  What economy is there in WoW?  Crafting mats?  They lose their purpose.  What is there to do?  
---
PvP
---
In 8 years time Classic will exist solely for PvP, because by design there will be nothing else to do.  
---
Get good 
---
I made the mistake of going enchanting while leveling. Unless it’s a new server your not gonna make much money enchanting until later levels. 
---
Because usually you sell the greens on the ah instead of disenchanting them which brings you in some money. 
---
The thing is everybody wants something different, and getting everybody to agree is like wrangling cats.
---
For instance:
---
I don't want to play the "Get every world buff in the game before attempting the first pull on MC game", so then the argument becomes, Well yes technically you COULD do that in vanilla wow, but the reality of it was nobody ever did, because 99% of the population had no idea how much of a difference stacking all those world buffs would be, the way I remember the game was struggling through content, even after you knew the mechanics, until you had good gear, then rinse and repeating on the next raid. In practice, having played P servers, its more of a grind BIS preraid, get worldbuffs, steamroll bosses nearly AFK until you get the drop you want for months on end, if you take the challenge out of the raids people are going to get burnt out quick.
---
When you split that down to the ideology principals between the two you get, Do you want a game that IS exactly what it was, or a game that plays like you remember. I think for most people if they are honest with themselves will go with the second option. For me personally I for sure would rather go with the second option, if that means removing world buffs when zoning into a raid or giving the bosses a 10% health buff then so be it.
---
Yea this bizarre animosity toward "private server players" is really obnoxious. Seems like everyone on this sub needs to be on some stupid bandwagon or another
---
FYI the info is not correct. Read the comments below if you want to find out how it actually works.
---
How would we even begin to determine this? The preraid best in slot item for both casters and healers are the same item.
---
The preraid best in slot items for every melee physical dps and hunters include a lot of leather items.
---
I guarantee they will.  Anyone who knows anything about business knows that you don't assemble a team of engineers to produce a remaster, in the age of remasters, to then not make a remaster of the next expansion when numbers were at peak MAUs.  
---
Random level layout and gear drops lead to exceptional replayability.  Classic will not have that.
---
That's not at all what he is talking about. He'S talking about these ultra right wing edgelords.
---
Just implementing a simple "Are you sure you want to allocate this item to Legolaz" would prevent this though.
---
It's not about how hard the farming or the gameplay is, it's about putting in that extra effort. If you are not handicapped and have a brain, you can be a feral druid worth bringing to raids. But the average players don't put in the effort. They also don't like to press the correct buttons at the correct times, and feral druid needs that extra work and thinking ahead. 
---
You NEED to powershift. It is something that is above the requirement to play a rogue or a warrior, extra step that takes extra effort to overcome, and that extra work drives the average players below what is viable. 
---
What bothers me are the social injustice warriors who's sole purpose is to spam trade chat trolling for rage reactions. Obviously you ignore these people but they are in every channel on these servers.
---
No and neither do you. There has only ever been one version of loot trading in World of Warcraft, and it's reasonable to assume they will either use the system or something closely resembling said system.
---
You can bugger off with your whiteknighting of Blizzard. We have a right to be worried about this.
---
Yeah how dare we enforce a moral code in a community of people LMAO
---
\#delete
---
You're most likely going top have to grind it. I'd Google/Youtube grinding spots and decide which you want to do. 
---
You could sell the spare mats/bags you have on AH and hope they're selling well. 
---
This is why you see alot of people say that you should always take skinning while levelling. The stuff you get you just vendor for easy hold without relying on AH to sell. I'm currently level 22 on a ps with 8G, just by vendering the leather from skinning. I always found it the best profession for easy gold on a fresh server or new character. 
---
Mods only remove stuff when it fits their agenda
---
12-15?
---
Vanilla is not a solo game. If you insist on playing solo anyway you will get ganked.
---
I went into my pserver as a former Vanilla noob in some respects, having played Vanilla and knowing a lot about PvP but very little PvE.
---
Literally from level 1 to max level, people were helpful to me every step of the way. I was in two leveling guilds and one end-game guild, everyone helped me with knowledge, parties, and even outright free items.
---
Even though I was a complete noob to many raids our raid leaders took the time to explain mechanics to me, my rotations, etc.
---
It's really mind boggling. I've seen and experienced more toxicity on this sub in a single week than I have in my entire months and months of time on a pserver.
---
You have absolutely nothing to support this statement. If you need roll in retail you can trade the item. BoE's are the only exception.
---
Before they removed Need/Greed that is.
---
Fantastic video!!! Keep them coming and keep up the quality! 
---
Yes.. Duh.. If the item did not become soulbound when you looted it there would be no need for loot trading.
---
Brainless.
---
Every group will know. The standard rule is you equip and use any item you win with a need roll. How exactly are you going to do that after you sell or trade the item to your friend in the party?
---
 It will be 100% obvious and scum like you will get blacklisted immediately.
---
But you cant know this. You have no way of knowing when an item is being traded.
---
Ironic that you have the truth exactly reversed. You can inspect in party and if you are not wearing the stuff you win you are known as a ninja. Otoh, gm ticket trades occur after a long delay due to the nature of the process and in that case you wouldn't know unless you checked days later.
---
You are still wrong. Five man groups, as a general rule, don't invite dps warriors. Leather dps items will go to rogues or hunters. It doesn't matter if the healer and caster share a drop because that's only two characters. Collision can't even occur unless three or more players are rolling on a drop. When mages and healers roll on truestrike you mark them as ninjas and move on. When hunter beats a rogue that isn't a loot trading failure, as no loot trading is occurring.
---
&gt; So can someone explain to me the purpose of openworld pvp and what makes it fun
---
What makes it fun is that your assumption: 
---
&gt;if you see an equal leveled, equal geared player of opposite faction, they'll probably ignore or avoid you.
---
is totally wrong.
---
This is not true in general. You need to character and (by default) hidden character levels. My long, initial comment has been censored for breaking subreddit rules, but what you found works until level 30 or so but does not work at one point during STV anymore.
---
The xp penalty is based on the level difference and is static. The coloring scales, so both just happen to overlap at low and mid levels.
---
If you follow this, you will sometimes get around 50% penalty for turning in green STV quests.
---
I think DM should be out on release because the Warlock epic mount quest is there. Without it, it would be impossible to get epic mount for months.
---
For the past 8 years or so I’ve played with the music off.
---
I should turn it back on for nostalgia to my innocent noob years...
---
Yep! Occasionally you’d get “tribute run”
---
You really are ignorant, aren't you? If you have master looter, you don't need to trade items, you can just send the item to who you want regardless of rolls. The point you seem to miss is that this went on throughout classic. Scamming wasn't widespread like you seem to think, because if you did cheat people out of loot you got blacklisted and couldn't pug anymore.
---
&gt; It's usually around AQ40 when you'll see the population **plummet due to raid logging.** 
---
Probably even earlier than that, I'm afraid. I suspect that a lot of people severely underestimate just how difficult it is to get 40 raiders online the same time every week.
---
Legends say a chromatic wall stands between those two zones, radiating the colors of spring and autumn on them.
---
Wow thats pretty lame tbh
---
You are the perfect target for my question so I'm sad you didn't answer it. You admit you attack and kill players even when they express no desire to fight you, playing a hunter no less. What makes it fun for you? What drives you to be a dick to people for no reason other than that you can?
---
Saying I'm bad at pvp is pretty baseless, I was glad for 3 seasons and enjoyed arena and bgs throughout Tbc and wotlk. As for openworld pvp, not liking something isn't a symptom of being bad at it, I'm sure you'll find often the reverse is true. If you dislike playing tennis then of course you'll suck at it, you've no desire to play or get good at tennis. 
---
Level 42 so what's your take on uldamann and gnomeregan?
---
Live in the US played a west coast server I don't even know what VC means? Deadmines was DM Dire Maul was DM E/N
---
My understanding of these guides back in the day, is that they were usually written by a single dude unassociated with the game's development, under tight deadlines, with little input from the game company them-self.
---
I can't imagine what a monumental pain in the ass it must've been to try to write one for a game like WoW.
---
Multitask, order online, eat while questing. Something I realised when I turned 30 is that I've wasted too much time waddling down the aisles in the supermarket or cooking. Now I order my groceries online, I cook maybe twice a week and it saves me a lot of time. And money too since I don't have to own a car which is extremely expensive in my country.
---
It's amazing to me that it's somehow "enlightened" to choose life over following societal norms. And I know I sound like r/iamverysmart but seriously, you don't have to live by the consumerism and dictations of society. 
---
This is very nice! Maybe group up multiple encounters in one video? Like, quick guides for all bosses in the spider wing and so on. Would be very handy to have.
---
You can absolutely get an epic mount before, just need to pay for it like all the other classes lol 
---
What's the purpose of this thread other than thinly veiled criticism that isn't even accurate?
---
Why does OP think anyone cares about a level 42 mage on a private server who quits because no lore, when WoW is actually rich in it.
---
How self entitled do you think this person is?
---
Notice too how he never mentions interacting with other players. Player interaction doesnt even calculate into his decision to quit. This is the kind of player that wants a solo experience where everything is epic because dev's tell you it's epic , and retail is perfect for him.
---
Subbed btw!
---
It does not at all. Pve has separate mechanics generally referred to as heartbeat resist. Where the mob can break free at any given moment but no DR. DR is a PvP mechanic only.
---
I can maybe see that being effective in small groups or PVP settings, but in a raid or more "organized" 5 man either your damage orhealing will be kind of lacking depending on gear.  You could gear for both, but other than windfury procs your weap damage would be pretty bad but heals would be OK.  I think you're better off speccing more fully into what you want to do most
---
Considering that this was probably written sometime throughout beta/early release, under some deadline, it's very probably that both the writer and whoever he was fighting both didn't know shit. At that level, the person who wins is the person who actually presses their buttons.
---
You have this impression of elitism only because you don't understand it. In vanilla the old content doesn't become obsolete once a new raid tier comes out, which means in a week (usualy 3 raid day) you might need to do molten core, onyxia, bwl and ZG. Optimising the speed of clearing raids is what makes a big difference between casual and harcore guilds, because the guilds that can't clear fast enough just don't have the time to clear all the available content and will receive less loot than a guild that can clear everything every week. 
---
Is the armor reduced enough to make up from not spending that rage on damage dealing abilities when leveling? Nope.
---
Well I couldn't get a group for Uldaman, I did run Gnomeregan a couple of times. I believe the lore is that the troggs took it from the gnomes? or there was a radiation leak maybe? who cares. You're job is to go in and get some data the gnomes left behind, oh and return a gold ring to it's owner aaaaand help a guy find a cure for balding. Lore is not the same as story. 
---
No, YOU have not understood the concept. If you start the fight with enough rage to fully apply sunders, then you should just use that rage to kill the mob right away.
---
Sunder is never worth it when leveling and killing non elites.
---
Bears also use it if they want to pull ahead in threat. Not as mandatory obviously but there are definitely many encounters you should use it in.
---
Pummeler is one of my favorite items in the game. Such a quirky item. I remember getting it at release on my Paladin and running around asking random mages to recharge it for me xD
---
&gt;I've been experimenting with it ever since I saw that Swifty starts all his PvP fights with four or five sunders.
---
Swifty might have been considered good at the time, but he is by no means a top notch warrior player.
---
I loved grinding levels there
---
&gt;And also, are you considering that by committing to the idea of saving rage for the next fight, you're basically giving up execute?
---
The saving rage idea isnt bad, but it only really works as arms. You fight one mob, then save rage when the mob is about to die. On the next pull you get two mobs, pop sweeping strikes and kill both with all you rage.
---
Bandage, and rinse repeat.
---
You are free to level however you want, but the game is 14 years old now. There wont be some magical new build you can discover that will level faster than established leveling builds at this point.
---
I hope that's true. I don't intend to play Classic WoW until WotLK is re-released.
---
Not only does it make no sense it was never implemented on live that way so I don’t know why people keep saying it was or should be that way.
---
IF you are going to use a build like this, and I strongly advice against it. Make sure you at least get Shield Specialization and one point in improved Shield Block. That way you can take advantage of a shield spike to increase your damage.
---
I could be wrong here, but I don't think anyone is contending that loot sharing reduces loot ninjas.  It reduces the huge number of GM tickets submitted because of accidental/wrongly looted items between 2 consenting players.  
---
\+++++I am not advocating for loot trading+++++  
---
When I first started Wow back in 2005, I need rolled on a caster dagger (with my warrior) at the end of SM library and won it.  The group called me a ninja and I had no idea that the dagger was an item designed for a caster.  The group explained to me why I was wrong to roll on it  and that I needed to submit a ticket to give it to the rightful recipient.  I did, and everything was made right by the GM after a couple hours.  This is the situation that loot trading will help with, taking the GM out of the equation.  It won't reduce loot ninjas, and it opens up a Pandora's box of other problems that some contend will render classic literally unplayable. 
---
Looks like I didn't remember correctly, thanks for clearing it up! Was it in later expansions that you got full rep when doing even gray faction quests? I believe it was in BC when I was rep farming and this was true. It's been, well, a decade though, so my memory might not be on point on this.
---
Loot trading never worked for greed only rolls in retail. It will be the same system it was at implementation or later. As long as they are alive for the boss encounter, eligible to receive loot from the boss, and in the group/raid. They will be able to receive loot via [loot trading.](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/) 
---
No, the 8 days played I spent leveling to 60 gives my character significance. Not some subscription that I pay automatically and never think about.
---
I never gate two shits about my characters on retail in later expansions even though I paid, because losing them was no big deal when I could level another character in a day.
---
[loot trading works on BoP.](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/) 
---
This reminds me of that extremely shiny and perfect looking brown shit from the Fallout 2 intro of the first mission with the ol' woman.
---
*Choooooosen One!*
---
I feel pretty confident that blizzard will keep classic free of micro transactions (granted they don't allow tokens - if they do then all bets are off).  However, I would not be surprised one bit if they direct "retail" to an aggressive, micro-transaction-fueled shell of its former self.  Classic would hold the interest of purist old gamers logging in 5 hours a week for fun, and retail would satisfy the bean counters at blizzard by fleecing the newish players who don't mind what the game in its current/future state.   
---
\&gt; ah i see. the good old "classic contrary to private servers, will die because people have to pay $10 a month" argument. yeah... are there people that realy believe that? 
---
A large  portion of the private server population plays because it's free. That's the orginal goal of private servers in the first place.
---
&gt; Wait, WHAT? The infamous Wailing Caverns is 4 bosses now? WTF!?
---
It's complete nonsense. All bosses are there, you have to kill all 4 druids to unlock escort leading to Murlock boss. Other bosses are considered optional but every RDF group does them anyways.
---
Yeah.. Healy shaman, WF totem, Strength totem, healing stream, and /faceroll through everything.  Don't even really need a tank, if it's another warrior (or ret paladin, WOOT WOOT) all four guys wearing plate, can taunt off each other if need be.. It's fine. 
---
But most FTP MMORPG's are straight up garbage. Wow private servers offer you wow style polish, subscription style polish, for free. That's the difference.
---
Yeah I mean I would go resto gear, but I'm just saying imp totems and white damage could help inch up the raid dps a bit. Unless we're stop casting all the time. Just wondering how much down time there is in a raid.
---
It comes back around though. If you do a red quest and turn it in, you’re losing raw xp. There are leveling gaps where quests aren’t enough. If you eliminate some of those quests by doing them early, you are making your life harder later.
---
I never heard anyone refer to it as such during Vanilla.
---
Keep in mind that you never do more than one wing of Dire Maul. You always advertise it as either DM:E, DM:W or DM:N/T (North or Tribute).
---
Someone just saying DM is clearly running Deadmines, so I dont see how anyone can be confused.
---
as a warrior you leave ton of abilties at rank1. only take higher ranks for what increase your damage. basically most utility and defensive abilities are rank1. read the description most next ranks of abilities, they don't really do much. 
---
some ppl listed abilities already, but you basically leave majority of  abilities at rank1. that what you should remeber.
---
If you worried about tanking, all you need for tanking 5mans is defensive stance, taunt and sunder armor, everything else is luxury.
---
so don't worry about it. rank up sunder armor.
---
slam - total crap, don't take any ranks of it.
---
revenge - will never will do much damage, don't hope for it that higher ranks of it will start to do damage, it won't. its not a damage ability. its a threat gen tool. you can do without. or leave at rank1.
---
thunder clap - same shit, don't hope some high ranks finally start doing damage, it won't, its a shit damage ability, not worth ranking up. max rank +100 damage for 20 rage. and you cant use it in d stance.
---
cleave - leave at rank1, unless you spec it, just so you know max rank ability at lvl 60 is only +50 bonus damage. so its not worth ranking up. again unless you take improved cleave in talents. 
---
shield slam - if you not maining tanking, and plan on tanking once in a while, don't take it, its a luxury. as i said you can tank by spamming sunder armor and heroic strike. its enough.
---
I feel like the appeal for these videos is seeing the run time on the thumbnail and it being sub 3 minutes. Not to mention it would take forever per video if i did it wing by wing. :P
---
That pretty much kills the entire purpose of loot trading in the first place.
---
Disagree with feral, at least in a PvP setting. FC are usually either full resto (swiftmend spec) or HotW spec (with some variants) but none of these actually "builds" feral. At best they'll get physical stats (ap, phys crit, str, agi) from PvP/tier set, but main focus is stam, int and +heal or +dmg/heal. 
---
To determine whether a balance druid can be viable, we should compare a group of five mages to a group of four mages and a balance druid providing 3% crit to the other four mages. Five mages are clearly still the stronger group, but is that group of four mages and a balance druid viable?
---
If we assume that there are 20 DPS in the raid, then each DPS group needs to contribute 25% of the total DPS that's required to defeat raid bosses. Can the group with four mages and an oomkin do that?
---
I'm not entirely sure when it changed.  In vanilla you can hit exalted with factions by level 45, but if you just grind to 60 and then do the quests it's impossible. 
---
Kek haven't played retail since first wave if cata 
---
thank you
---
Stop worrying and wait a few months to actually see the progress they made?.... 
---
This is really good to know, I thought the same thing so I'd end up skipping green quests. Good to know that I can still do those and get full exp.
---
I really hope This happens
---
No changes!  Win trading is an authentic part of the classic experience!  /s
---
Yeah cause it's totally the same team that's working on classic that's making models for store mounts.
---
No changes. Dodging was part of classic. 
---
I don't think we ever tried him. What does he have to do with the four horsemen? I thought he was in the plague wing, not the military wing.
---
I don't really get why people talk as if it's natural that there will never be new Classic servers.
---
You know, this stuff is very simple. Blizzard can either release new content/progress through expansions (a hot topic for debate), or release fresh servers periodically. If they do neither of those options, they *will* bleed population to private servers, which will become very accurate once Classic is out and they have access to genuine 1.12 data.
---
Now, do you think that Blizzard is going to let that happen? Of course they aren't. They will do *something* to retain players, even if it's just launching new servers periodically. In which case we'd be in the exact same situation as private servers are today, which have shown to be successful for 10+ years now.
---
Blizzard has to make some absolutely god awful decisions for the game to not be successful in the long term, because private servers have already shown that it is successful.
---
You're not wrong it would help raid DPS a bit.  But by a very small amount =)  
---
If you have that much time to do autoattacks, then healing isn't as needed, perhaps a regular DPS class would be more effective.  
---
But it could work.  Viable perhaps, but "optimal" I would have to say no.  Depending on the guild you might be asked to not do what you propose. 
---
See i have always wanted this over the loot trading. Like are you Sure you want to give this to this guy?
---
Sounds like you are just a ninja
---
Stop mumbling, enunciate more, and listen to your audio before you upload next time.
---
When I first started listening to this I thought there was no audio because it was so quiet. Then after turning my volume so loud that my system beeps are almost painful...now I can hear you, but you're mumbling so much in some places that I can't make out what you're saying.
---
This is incorrect.
---
I miss 3 tank bosses, I was rarely good enough for main tank but rounded up adds like a cowboy
---
Are there any EU streamers planning on playing? 
---
All in all it seems like a gamble really. Popular streamers will mostly make sure the server won't be desolated. I suppose I'd join a streamer's realm too. I entirely don't care for them (don't even know them) but population is good.
---
You didn't see them because they were stealthed
---
😂😂😂🔥

*screeching intensifies*

There’s actually a lot of reasons to go to azshara and the comments here are weird.
---
Class quests.
---
A world boss, Azuregos.
---
Rich thorium.
---
Fishing.
---
There are actually some leveling quests here.
---
You go here to get your quints for molten core.
---
You farm satyrs for felcloth and demonic runes.
---
I also believe you go back here for a few different quest chains such as the one from blasted lands.
---
Good zone? No. Useless? Nah.
---
Okay, what is your suggestion OP, what should we do against sharding?
---
They could have "leagues" sort of like PoE, after the league your character is stored on the "main" server kind of thing. Main server toons could be used for bc further down the road or something.
---
It’s still fine. 
---
So you're telling me that white guys AREN'T the most likely candidate to be edgelords online??? Lol from my experience, anybody who says "cuck", "autism", or "kek" in a non-warcraft setting ends up being a white guy 
---
You know what my favorite is? When a Molten Giant or some big ass raid monster drops a Level 45 Food Item. "Why does this Giant have a single Homemade Cherry Pie"?
---
A little quiet there.
---
OK that's a whole level of toxic I didn’t know existed.  But I'm neither a racist, homophope, nazis, or pvper.
---
Blizzard shouldn't dodge this fix in my opinion.
---
The plural is elven
---
Nightsong actually came out in Cataclysm in case you didn't know. But still one of the greatest WoW tracks
---
Well, the server I was on during Vanilla the horde never had more than 20 people in an AV. Cross-realm PVP is Vanilla so hopefully you and many others don't cause them to change vanilla. 
---
Actually wintrading was as far as i know, not dodging. They used to just give the other team wins if it was premade vs premade, from what i heard 50/50 each. (I didn't do lvl 60 bg's back then)
---
Lol
---
Astonishing, this subreddit will tar and feather Blizzard for changes while at the same time advocating for changes when it suits them.
---
I'm a little late on this, but I love to see how many players aren't currently subbed to WoW. I don't think classic wow will resurrect the game, but I sure hope it'll open Blizzard's corporate eyes.
---
also, KEK at the ones who answered "under one week" to go from 1 to 60. That would be possible with speedrun tactics, tons of gold and competent high-level friends, but on launch? Forget it, even if you play 10-15 hours a day.
---
&gt;That was never experienced on Nost.  But it was on several of the p-servers after Nost.
---
I dont think this is necessarily a private server thing. These people exist in every game ever. It's just you wont ever see them spam the chat with these things when the chat channels are being moderated. On Blizzard servers you will get suspended for saying "gas the jews" or whatever, and these people wont be doing it.
---
&gt; The best way around this is joining a guild and running dungeons with them.
---
In other words, don't ever run with pug. 
---
We should not be making the game more antisocial just to avoid a crappy loot system.  This directly defies the vanilla design philosophy and is a major step backwards in fostering a strong and stable community.
---
I’m not sure if it’s just nostalgia or something else, but it just doesn’t seem like the same awe, wonder, and immersion can be created in retail wow. 
---
Yeah it’s easier for some people to just label others as toxic than to navigate a social environment that might be difficult for them. 
---
That being said, I remember playing some league around 8 years ago and was just absolutely blown away at how terrible people could be to each other. 4s RT in Warcraft 3 is similar, but if you go out of your way to keep moral up, it is miraculous at how much better people treat each other. You can’t be annoying though. 
---
Sounds like you enjoy different things than other people and are having a hard time accepting that.
---
Play on a pve server, they were literally meant for players who don't like world pvp.
---
Oh snap really? My memory I guess failed me.. but yeah it sure is good! 
---
There are just as many who would pay but won't play on a private server because they risk losing all their progress.
---
I am guilty of this myself to be honest. When you do dungeons and you wipe because some hunter backpedal into a giant group of mobs, well I get pissed about stuff like that.
---
Original Ashenvale song is very similar but Nightsong is on another level. Best thing to come out of Cataclysm? Lol
---
Thanks for that. I logged onto a level 20 warrior the other day and I was shocked at how fast everything died. No way it's optimal at that level... Brb gonna try it on my level 28 to confirm.
---
That’s for sure! At least the music from wow hasn’t taken the path of legion/BFA..
---
How is DKP fair? DKP is the worst system at allocating gear where it would do the most good for the guild. You may have a bidwar and a good weapon, which leaves all your top rogue without DKP when the last item he needs for a major setbonus upgrade drops.
---
I do not think loot council work in more average guilds though. However when you play in top of the shelf guilds where players rarely leave, it is by far the best system. It allows you to assign gear where it will do the most good. It makes sure healers get their 15% mana regen in combat bonus from T2 as soon as possible. It makes sure you gear up a hunter with 8/8 T2 for the armor penetration bonus, and it makes sure your tanks get the gear they need to pull enough threat for your DPS to not overaggro.
---
Apart from that I honestly believe that just straight up rolling for items with some priority based on attendance and specs would be a more fair way of handling loot than DKP.
---
&gt;dungeon finder
---
Yikes!
---
Lol made it AWFUL maybe. Goblin starting zone is cancer. 
---
A large part of the private server community are going to be the "hardcore" players spread across a multitude of servers come retail classic. Most of the people have played wow since its inception, and know the game like the back of their hands. You'll find some people have very little tolerance for any players slowing them down etc. Just stay away from these people you'll easily be able to avoid them when classic has an influx of people who haven't played on private servers before.
---
Good call, thanks!
---
Something that does the job poorly is still better than something that is completely worthless.
---
Swap out the Warrior for a Priest and make the Warlocks use their VW as emergency bubbles. Have Healthstones and Mana Potions to extend your parties resources. You're gonna die a lot in the first hour of you guys learning to sync with each others playstyles.
---
Not sure what response you were expecting from this sub, it’s full of blizzard white knights.  They will defend their daddy to the death.
---
Nope.
---
&gt; From Blizzard's perspective. This means they can get brand recognition ...
---
They are way beyond needing brand recognition. 
---
&gt; While the compensation model would be something for blizzard to decide.
---
Blizzard is about making money, it is that culture that led to people leaving this game. They would only do your idea if they could make real money out of it.  Which means they would have to charge substantially for the license, what private server operator would pay that. 
---
&gt; If classic doesn't live up to expectations, then you could play on a licenced server from an operator whom you trust.  
---
This is the real problem with your idea. How do you know you could trust some pserver operator? How could you trust that they would keep the game clean, and maintain enough servers for a good experience, or that they would not shut down at any time?
---
A large population of the private server community play because it’s a game they cannot otherwise play. A very small portion play because it is free. 
---
Also the point of private servers was never to offer free things. It was to offer things the game company no longer offers, with their own twist to it. The OSRS PS scene was super big. OSRS came out and guess what... that scene is literally dead. 
---
Yes, some people do choose to play on Private Servers because they are free, but if a company is never going to release an older copy of their game, and you want to play it and you can, why not? 
---
I recommend checking out r/financialindependence if you havent. But yeah I completely agree. The 'standard' path of life recommended in Western society is gross

Yeah it has a good amount of rich thorium for those juicy arcane crystals. Its also a good place to farm exp in your high 40’s low 50’s because it is usually less populated than it’s contemporary zones. 
---
People can say ganking sucks all they like. But truth of the matter is, most of those big world pvp  fights between two small raids of opposing factions more than likely started off someone getting ganked. 
---
I remember plenty of times ganking someone a few times in STV on my level 30 something, than getting ganked by that players main which forces me to get on my main and then someone calls a friend and before you know it it's a battle with 10- 20 people.
---
Honestly, most of the elitist minmaxers you see on here is irrelevant once you have a guild and friends to play with. Tauren for tanking is still great and warstomp is incredibly useful and clutch in PVP. Play whatever you prefer. 
---
Well technically the post was about CLEARING naxx not just the 4 horsebois, and you said you dont need consumes for naxx basically.
---
Incorrect.
---
Yeah Blizzard still hires some of the best music and art people in the industry, a big part of it because of their history and artists' desire to work for them growing up which is generally unaffected by some of the poor gameplay design decisions.
---
I've been to a couple university game dev events with Blizzard recruiters and while most of the crowd is programmers as you might expect, the Blizzard recruiters were really asking for a lot of art folks. Also, they hire people mid-career who come from an industry completely different than video games.
---
That's why I believe the business side of things is messing up so much of the company because we know they're still one of the best in other departments outside gameplay.
---
Yet to watch, but would be cool if it included which resistance potion to use before each fight. Have been personally writing down notes in my phone since I find it a bit hard to remember.
---
Big part of the Private Community   knows about the flair of classic. It's not about getting everything fast. It's about "getting there WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE". Because that's just what Classic is going to be. We won't see Naxxramas before Winter 2020. This isn't a speed competition. It's about a fun after-hours-activity where we can all relax and simply have some fun.

Just wow, nostalgia kicks in hard with this one...
---
If no additional content are made after all the Naxx clears people plan on having within the first month, and you argue for the fact that it will bore the people off wow, then will there still be people left on wow who has Naxx on farm? That just clears up the throne of people who was farming Naxx, hence there will still be a carrot for people to continue playing, to reach the end game content. 
---
Just killed a bunch of level 29-30s on a 27 toon. They survived long enough to take full advantage of it. Not only that, I started testing vs one mob with 50 rage (all points in fury btw) heroic strike vs 3 sunders then whites, both trying to end the fight with 50-60 rage again. Results seemed to be, sunders = 50% health remains. Heroic = 35% health remains, which also means the fights went faster with the sunders. The higher level mobs means that they were going to always survive longer, (more health more misses etc) so the effects of sunder were amplified. But now I'm quite sure that on higher level mobs (with mid level armor) sunder is quite effective in direct comparison regardless of spec. Levels 27-39 might be a good time to spec to my suggested one above. (Not positive about Rend anymore) But I do agree that mortal strike must be superior, my plan was never to stick with this past level 40.
---
We didn't, but I don't think we did Loatheb so I can't speak for him. When we realized we needed to recruit 4-5 geared tanks to progress further we just gave up and waited for TBC. We had killed 10 or 11 bosses or something like that at that point, I can't really remember since it was 12 years ago or something.
---
&gt; I'm neither a racist, homophope, nazis, or pvper.
---
This should be on a tabard you get for playing on a PvE realm.
---
You joke, but there is so many things that are unironically considered an authentic part of the vanilla experience on this sub.
---
Griefing, ganking, bad server infrastructure, shoddily coded encounters, win trading, ninja looting, many more.
---
How many of them are down to the preponderance of pirate servers, rose tinted goggles or 9 year olds playing vanilla and growing up into reddit users, however, I cannot say.
---
It was escalated on the p-servers because a) they wanted a large population to insure success, and b) there weren't mods / reports / bans happening because they wanted that large-server feel.
---
There were times in the main cities that I had to turn off /g and /trade because it was the election year and that's ALL you heard.  The worst I heard were the discussions of the holocaust -- on /g wherein doubt was cast about the truthfulness of this event  because they (the poster) didn't know what was done with all of the ashes of the deceased, he felt there should have been piles of them.
---
Yes, that is the shit talk that occurred on a few of the servers.
---
And I will be THANKFUL that Blizz shuts that shit down quickly.
---
&gt;You admit you attack and kill players *even when they express no desire to fight you*
---
Then why did they roll on a PvP server? Your whole thread doesn't make sense, and comes off as "stop liking what I don't like". Just roll PvE and your problem is solved...
---
The very worst part of WC was to get to the last boss (and as a cloth wearer) and either lose on the ring or the blue cloth; then run it again only to wipe on the last boss, or have him glitch, or have someone run up and start the event without everyone back from afk (bathroom break.)  Oh yeah.
---
Yes! More! Everything! Love it
---
You didn't even have to do that, no one ever did "LFG DM" unless they meant DM, they did DME/DMW/DMN/DMT.
---
I want to have fun in ZG and AQ20.  To me, those are the fun raids, the not-so-serious raids, the friendly get-together raids where you can relax, kill bosses, and just relax.
---
While on the p-servers, I purposely stayed away from the ZG's and the AQ20's.  Those I want to re-explore with a fun group of people, kill every single boss, every single NPC, and have a happy group leaving with their new loots.  
---
Take the trinket
---
let me know if you're offended and I'll gladly apologize 
---
You get much more rep for turning in quests while they're still green, which is a great way to work towards exalted while leveling 
---
Literally wasn't part of vanilla. This strategy wasn't known back then. 
---
Private servers are free, and reset about yearly/monthly (New servers are opened, leaving the previous "big" server with a quickly dwindling population), there is no private server that has gone on for 10 years with a consistent population above like 100, hell, not even 5 years. This is a pretty goofy argument. 
---
I played on a private server as a mage a while back and my raid icon was always star. A while later they made a fresh server and I rolled rogue, marked sheep as star and was mocked mercilessly for the rest of the run.
---
Trump obviously is a hunter main though.
---
I remember them when I first ran deadmines though admittedly I didn’t start for at least a year since launch.

Farming soul shards before raid
---
I have an understanding of how you feel. I played Classic from release and also played TBC, Cataclysm and BFA. I feel that Classic would be significantly improved by improved story telling that later expansions improved upon such as audio and cut scenes that help the user follow along with the story. 
---
I also feel that the later expansions had a more obvious “main” quest line in zones which helped to communicate the story of the zone to the player. 
---
In general I feel like Classic is a more fun game to play, mainly due to challenging gameplay which feels rewarding, but I definitely think some of the story telling techniques have improved through out expansions. 
---
It literally tells you in the manual that ganking and griefing is a part of the game and to play on a PvE server if you don't like it.
---
Lol didn't know grey quests gave xp... I've abandoned tons of completed grey quests...
---
The majority of players don’t though.  Just saying pservers only stay popular through fresh servers
---
Oh I'm well aware lol.  It's become a joke at this point.  People are petitioning to simulate mechanics that were literally due to technical limitations, bring back exploits,  and ensure design flaws that were never addressed before 2.0 remain unaddressed.  That's the opposite of blizzlike.
---
This is voice of reason among the madness. 
---
No it's not but I wouldn't cry if they released a new version of WotLK that didn't have it. I like the dungeon finder, it has a good purpose but I also see why people don't want in the game. Either way, I'll find a group quickly as a holy priest so it doesn't matter to me.

Not fake news at all. You explained it exactly correct. If you are greater than 5 levels above a quest level, then that quest = gray, which is where the scaling down begins. Exactly as I described it.
---
Yeah I have had both 19 twinks and 29 twinks. 19 bracket is usually more popping. Biggest number of twinks by far.
---
But the 29 bracket is hands down more fun to play. Just better skills and more options for almost every class.

Rep definitely scales down, or else it would be trivial to get exalted with all other factions by just going and stomping as a 60 through all the low level zones and getting a metric ton of REP for that faction.
---
It's a difference in mindset. My retail characters will eventually be gone too, so there's no "real" difference to me. At this point I care more about my private server characters than my retail characters.
---
Yes, this is important to note. People kind of assume "Oh so a green quest is just as good to do as a yellow quest". That's not true. The green quest is still going to give it's full XP, but the green quest is mean't for a lower level player so the amount of XP you get from it isn't going to be as good for your level as a yellow quest would be. The yellow quest gives a good amount of XP for your CURRENT level while the green quest (while still giving it's full XP value) is not going to give as much.
---
The XP amount scales down fairly quickly. It's usually not great to do em.
---
Blizzard said : pvp happens on pvp server 
---
&gt; Also the point of private servers was never to offer free things. It was to offer things the game company no longer offers, with their own twist to it. 
---
Not true at all, most MMO's back in the day had private servers the moment they launched. When wow launched it had people playing the closed beta client on a shitty private server. Not because people were that excited about the beta, no because it was free. Paying a sub for games wasn't very accepted back then.
---
The whole persevation thing is new.
---
It is indeed a radical idea, but what if it could be like a mod community, regulated by Blizzard, you pay your $15 a month or whatever and can play on any of the servers.
---
I think a lot of the problems with corrupt server operators stem from having the financial burden (and power) on the operators themselves. Operators need to look for ways to pay for their time and server costs - and some just flat out want to run a get-rich-quick scheme. If you had someone that is essentially under Blizzard salary to operate a server, paid for by the sub income, it might work?
---
Again, very radical, and we're very far from it even if it's possible, and the math might not even add up. But interesting idea
---
krappa
---
Money is still the main issue if you're broke.
---
Oh man, I used to take the long routes just to see that one!
---
Its true.
---
The reason I hope BGs are region wide. Once there is 5+ servers to contend with, becomes much harder to do this.
---
Not sure of you are being sarcastic or not but.
---
If so: haha good one
---
If not: fair enough, but if you want the true classic experience then you should only read about things that were availble at the time. No thottbot or wowheads. Dont look boss encounters or min/max specing. True Vanilla experience! 
---
I'll address these in order
---
&gt; They are way beyond needing brand recognition.
---
This might be true, I meant Brand Loyalty. A Warcraft game is a Warcraft game.
---
&gt; Blizzard is about making money, it is that culture that led to people leaving this game. They would only do your idea if they could make real money out of it. Which means they would have to charge substantially for the license, what private server operator would pay that.
---
I think Activation Blizzard is about money. Making real money with managing a licence is only a risk if it cannabises more subs then it would cost. So you'd be looking a monthly or a yearly due (it's what I would do).  It's very clear a Private server can be [immensely profitable](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/08/the-88-million-server-private-wow-server-op-loses-big/), making upward of 7 figures if the discovery in civil cases is to be believed. I don't even think you'd have to charge substantially for the licence for it to be a wildly profitable endeavor.
---
&gt;  This is the real problem with your idea. How do you know you could trust some pserver operator? How could you trust that they would keep the game clean, and maintain enough servers for a good experience, or that they would not shut down at any time?
---
This is the risk that existing operators have had to hazard. You can see the biggest effort made by a lot of these server operators. Imagine how much better they could do with an actual development kit. It's clear there are people out there with the passion and the ability to make these servers. If you unshackle the need to take steps to get ahead of Blizzard's legal team, imagine what they could accomplish.
---
they shouldn't. I said they shouldn't.
---
Read again and use head first please.
---
I didn't phrase it correctly, what I meant was why WOULD they ever implement cross-realm mechanics in Classic? What's there to gain for them? 
---
On feenix and rebirth servers there were tons of blacklisted people. They stole enchanting mats or other crafting materials, or deliberately stole item with master loot before the boss died. 
---
Why do people think that these people are going to trade them the items they want just because the mechanic exists? Never going to happen! They stole it on purpose. The more upset you get about it the happier their are. Get a clue people. 
---
Loot sharing is nonsense and has no place in classic. 
---
Yup, also you can dodge a LOT of these toxic types (not all of them unfortunately) but a lot of them by **playing a PvE server. **I expect that to be the same when the official classic launches too. Its not that PvE servers dont have toxic players as well; its that the bulk of the super tryhard edgelord: championship edition guys wouldnt dream of playing on a server where they couldnt gank lowbies.
---
/shrug. You end up with a much more chill community on the whole, and the toxic people stick out like a sore thumb, get blacklisted and unable to progress, then have meltdowns in worldchat calling everyone "cucks" then they reroll on some PvP server somewhere.
---
#DownVoteForest
---
You don’t even make any sense. Please use your head and try again. 
---
I have seen decent elemental shaman numbers. And depending upon the resist values of mobs come classic (private servers completely had zero idea) about resist values of raid bosses. Election shamans may be more viable if we find bosses to have less nature resist baseline. Still run into some mana issues, but it can be combated somewhat by chugging mana pots/dark runes etc
---
Upvoting forest in 2019 smfh
---
Warriors know. #GreenQuestGang
---
You dont think Classic will have active addon developers?
---
As soon as they start getting their T2 they start getting strong
---
Of course there will.  Why wouldn't there be?
---
Splintertree or Zoramgar???
---
How would I know I don’t work there. 
---
Why does it exist in retail? Because they don’t want to close dead servers and create the illusion that hardly anyone is playing anymore? It’s obviously anyway they’ve lost most players since 2012. 
---
Some servers are 4 servers combined. Instead of merging them together and greatly reducing the amount of available servers to pick from, they use cross realm mechanics to keep them open.
---
Pirate servers being free might not be the ONLY reason they are so huge, but I guarantee you they wouldn't be nearly as huge if they required a subscription. Not even close. 
---
Yeah sorry but it's not close. Feral's who go all put can actually compete with pure dps classes as long as they go balls to the wall with consumes/crowd pummlers etc.
---
Yo thats a straight up lie or plain ignorance. There are more people playing OSRS than are playing the main runescape. 
---
http://misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/
---
And yet you believe they'll implement it even if you can't see any benefit for them in doing it. Do you think they just want to spite Classic lovers? 
---
Reasoning behind retail features doesn't apply to Classic in most cases since it's developed under completely different premises.
---
From a business perspective it doesn't make sense for Blizzard to implement things like CRZ.
---
You mind sharing your gear?
---
&gt; Do you want a game that IS exactly what it was, or a game that plays like you remember. 
---
Well I never played Vanilla so I want a game that is exactly as it was or as close as possible so I can experience that. I don't want a version based on your memories or anyone else memories or the expectations you have. I want Vanilla so that I can play Vanilla.
---
Every time someone like you make all these comments about changes, no matter how logical they may seem, what you really are saying to me is "you think you want vanilla but you don't".
---
Yes do more, there is a high demand for this. As you said boss mechanics arent hard but especially ZG as an entry level raid has some mechanics you need to know beforehand
---
What’s does being ultra right wing have to do wit anything? 
---
Have you been to the internet lately? Any moba or battle royal is way worse than what i have seen on any ps. Granted there are a lot of tryhards and minmaxers but with the official launch those wont be the majority
---
Fuck no, making enemies and friends in BGs was the best part of Classic PvP
---
Thats a fair statement, I would say though no matter how faithfully they recreate it, it will never be what it was. The experience of vanilla was so much due to the time and lack of knowledge about the game and all that will be gone this time around.
---
Not really, I've had someone call me toxic when I asked them to "stop wasting time and come south" in AV. I don't think that's toxic at all.
---
How is dungeon finder not a bad addition to the game?  
---
It already hurt the social aspect of it and since you're on the subreddit for classic wow I assume I need not mention how important a healthy social aspect is to MMORPGs in the end. 
---
I don't play retail anymore. It's terrible. Nice try though.
---
I haven't decided shit.  Blizzard decided it.  When they didn't want to hire thousands of GM's because people like yourself would fuck up who should get what loot.
---
Because I'm not a moron and know what items are good for what classes.  And inspect is a thing.
---
You're 100% right about AQ sucking ass. Not looking forward to the trash
---
I think blizzard has lost touch with reality, I have no faith that they will ever go back to being the way they were. I mean, diablo 3 completely missed the mark for almost all diablo 2 fans and diablo immortal is a continuation in the wrong direction. Im afraid that casual/mobile games are simply more profitable for less effort so thats where they are being directed to go. casual games and old game remakes that take much less effort. I look forward to diablo 2 hd.
---
im done with products on the blizzard launcher, if they try and monetize the shit out of classic there goes their last chance to get me back as a customer.
---
destiny sucked me in because i always wanted to play that but never was a console person.
---
its pretty simple , if they fuck up classic they are done , i already have little to no interest in any games that come out on that launcher.
---
If they allow tokens it's pretty much over. Players will be tempted to just put in 200$/€ and buy a shitload of gold and buy LH helms and Edgemasters and Krol Blades and Devilsaurs without farming for a second. It will absolutely ruin the experience.
---
That's what I will do if tokens come in. I don't think they should be in the game but if they are I will abuse the shit out of my IRL finances to get an edge in game.
---
Sit on crit wont work in classic
---
Yeah priest leveling is cake. Keep your wand current and you can grind endlessly. Not at the fastest pace, but you can literally go non stop.
---
I love the illustrations! Such brevity! Very well done. I hope you continue to make these tutorials. 
---
No doubt that was intentional.
---
&gt; Im afraid that casual/mobile games are simply more profitable for less effort so thats where they are being directed to go. 
---
This is absolutely true. And for companies that are about the profits, and not passionate about making great games, it is unlikely they would transcend that formula. But Blizzard has already proven that they can make a great game and be profitable. 12 million subs at 15$ per month is profitable. And they don't have to start from scratch putting in the effort it takes to make a game like WoW because they already have the essence of it. They just need to go back to their roots of what made the game great, and rework it (so-to-speak), and basically bring it back from the dead. 
---
I play on a WotLK server regularly and I have no issues with being social. Just because people don't stand around the town waiting for someone show up looking for a group does not mean people don't want to talk to you or interact with you outside of dungeons. Instead of waiting for someone to engage in a conversation with you try doing it yourself first (this is not directed at you personally, I am talking in general about the people who want to be social without putting any effort into it themselves).
---
Here's what I like to do: I go around the low level areas and occasionally drop in Stranglethorn Vale and I give a huge load of supplies to the players. Potions, scrolls, bags etc.  I also like to throw in a blue quality weapon wrapped as a present to get their reaction.  S
---
ometimes these same people mail me with messages of gratitude. One of the most memorable ones was from a human warlock that I gave sent 10 gold which was worth much, much more than the stuff I gave him. He appreciated my gesture even tho he didn't need it since he had a level 80 main so he rewarded me for it - and at that time I definitely needed that 10 gold.
---
I think it is more of dead body pulling themselves up from the bloody ground they died on.
---
keep it off until classic, imo. Will make it even better.
---
I first played it in February 2005 at a friend's house. Rolled human mage and just played around for half an hour. I was very impressed by how large it was and by the nice style of the graphics. I wanted to buy it soon after, but unfortunately it was sold out in the stores in my town (ordering games online was still uncommon, because you needed a creditcard for that, which I didn't have). I could finally but it in April of that year, and my friend told me to roll horde on The Maelstrom-EU, because that server just launched and that's where he and his friends had started. So I made a female Troll Warrior, and leveled up to about level 14. I soon found myself quite bored with Warrior class and the Barrens zone, so I stopped playing for a few weeks. 
---
A few weeks later I encountered a WoW topic in a forum that I visited regularly back then, and found out that a few guys were gonna roll Horde on some other server, so I decided to join. I chose the Rogue class and immediatly loved it. Much faster and more enjoyable than the Warrior class. I leveled up to 20 and we did the Wailing Caverns together, my first Instance experience. I think I was very impressed. However I think after a few more levels I got bored again, and the guys from the forum also didn't play as often anymore so I lost interested. The leveling seemed very slow and I didn't have any people to play with, so I quit for a while again. 
---
In the end of the summer of that year I got one of my best friends to buy and play the game. This was when it started to get really fun. We rolled on Bladefist-EU, me as a rogue again and he as a hunter. Now that we could quest together, we quickly became addicted to the game. Sometimes we would stay up the whole night playing. One time my friend would suddendly go offline because his parents had found out and just cut the internet line. After many days and nights of playing, at January 2006 we both dinged level 60.
---
At level 60 we mostly did the 'endgame instances' like Stratholme, UBRS and Scholomance to get good blue gear. The rest of the time we would do battlegrounds. I remember that only a small portion of the server was into raiding. The vast majority of the level 60's walked around in just blue gear, with the occasional reputation epic like The Unstoppable Force. At that time I was also in a guild, that started to attemp Zul Gurub. The first boss went down on our first night, but I remember the second boss taking weeks before it got downed. It was probably a good noob-filter, which we definatly all were back then. By trial and error we managed to clear ZG, MC, BWL, part of AQ20 and only 2 or 3 bosses of AQ40 before The Burning Crusade game out. Which I also bought and played, but only managed to reach level 68, probably because of WoW-fatigue.
---
My memories from WoW are very nice, but I'm not sure if I will buy Classic WoW. Because unfortunately it will never be the same as that first time anymore, everyone is an expert at WoW now compared to back in 2005 and 2006. All content is known already. People will reach level 60 within a week and a big part of the server will be walking around in purples within months. All very different from what it was like when it first came out.
---
I agree that vanilla has it's set of issues but griefing and ganking is one of the core experiences on a pvp server.
---
How many TM-SS wars started because of pointless skirmishes in the yeti cave looking for Helcular's rod?
---
I agree but I think it’s less about the money itself and more about what you pay it for. Private servers have always been kinda sketchy. With classic you’ll get a fully supported game.
---
Alright. Even without it'd still be better than prot for levelling. 
---
I'm sure it was! But I wish people didn't. 
---
I missed it, looked for it, couldn't find it, and am now sad. 
---
Never quested there but visited it on my paladin maybe twice, knew where it was. Fuck
---
if blizzard doesnt want to hire more gms for classic to deal with loot mistakes.. i ll stick to what i said . Also im not suggesting changes to the game, i am suggesting a change to the change they decided to do first. 
---
Gimping the experience without PvP imo
---
I have never raid on vanilla, not TBC. Thank you for the guide.
---
Update. It showed up to my doorstep the day after my comment. Shows me to be impatient.
---
Great book so far.
---
You may start the "6th" instance 1 hour after the "1st" instance is complete/reset.
---
Instance A started at 00:00, completed at 00:03
---
Reset at 00:03, Instance B started
---
Instance B started at 00:03, completed at 00:06
---
Reset at 00:06, Instance C started
---
Instance C started at 00:06, completed at 00:09
---
Reset at 00:09, Instance D started
---
Instance D started at 00:09, completed at 00:12
---
Reset at 00:12, Instance E started
---
Instance E started at 00:12, completed at 00:15
---
Reset at 00:15... if you attempt to zone in now, it will tell you you've been in too many instances in an hour, because you can't have been in Instance A, B, C, D, E, and F all within 60 minutes
---
You can zone into Instance F at 01:03, because at that point, your last 60 minutes you would have entered only 5 instances: B, C, D, E, F
---
You also earn less faction reputation for completing a quest that is below your level.
---
They are not going to change the game drastically to replicate past game play and design. The audience that played wow during its growing stages from release until mid WOTLK have largely stopped playing and moved on, while a newer player base has replaced it of people who prefer the current design. They cannot get back the original audience by changing the game, and would alienate the current player base.
---
That wont work. The issue with 4HM are the marks. You NEED to taunt to be able to do it. It's nothing like the Wrath version where the horsemen just ran into place in their own little corner. You had to actually tank them and move them into position yourself.
---
Heroes of the storm dead game!
---
Talent given abilities cost a pathetic amount of money from trainers to rank up.
---
It's not too applicable as a Warrior, but the knowledge can't hurt.
---
Instance IDs are created when the party leader creates an instance, which is the first time that person (or a member of their group) enters the instance after a reset, either manual or automatic (due to time since last entrance).
---
The game doesn't check the number of instances you've been in in the last hour until you try to zone in. So you can reset the instance but it won't let you zone in. Others can enter your instance, though. This also means that if you just ran 5 instances yourself, and you join someone else's group with a fresh instance and new ID, you can't zone into their instance until 60 minutes after you zoned into the 2nd of 5 previous instances (basically until the 1st of 5 "falls off" the list of instances you've been in int he last 60 minutes)
---
i also played on bronzebeard from late vanilla to MoP, RIP bronzebeard
---
Warriors or Feral druids for tanking them. There are 4 bosses that each apply a debuff that deals periodic damage. The debuff stacks the longer you remain near them. So you always need 1 tank on each horseman, and you need extra tanks that can move between the corners to taunt them off of whoever is currently tanking to make the marks reset.
---
The biggest issue back in the day was that Taunt resists can easily mean your tank dies. The 5set T3 give you less chance for taunt to be resisted so guilds had to gear a bunch of tanks with it.
---
It will be easier this time around though, as guilds will already be aware of this and can start farming the trinket from ZG (Spellhit on use) to give to each of their tanks ahead of time.
---
You cant kill Loatheb without Greater Shadow Protection Potions. Every healing spell share a 1minute cooldown on that fight, and the boss deals periodic aoe shadow damage to the whole raid.
---
You have to reserve all your heals for the current tank, which means the rain will mostly rely on preventing the damage with consumables, and bandages.
---
Very important. Time is the ONLY luxury.
---
You need to define what you mean by hard. Nothing in Vanilla is "hard" if you think in terms if retail. Every boss is mechanically simple. The difficulty comes from requiring 40 players to cooperate, and to gear these players up optimally to meet gearcheck requirements, as well as making sure everyone bring the required consumables for the raid.
---
To say Naxx in vanilla is not hard is very ignorant of how the game functions.
---
People who refer to things as toxic are usually the most toxic of all. Anything you don't like or agree with is "toxic" and must be censored, removed, silenced. 
---
What was your DK’s name? I played on Aman’Thul for quite a while from WOTLK up to about halfway through Legion.
---
There has been 0 clarification on sharding and classic, we know 'it is a tool we have in an arsenal' but there is nothing else to go off of. Until something is set in stone by blizzard there is really not much to be said but "no sharding please"
---
What are you on about? How is griefing ganking and ninja looting not part of vanilla? You are conflating player behavior and game design together for some reason. And the shoddily coded encounters were generally fixed through the patches, especially 1.12. 
---
Thats how you make youtube video titles. And it is a major problem that he evidences and gives feedback in a concise manner.
---
make sure to write which boss you're making a guide on in the title. Otherwise, any and all guide content will be highly appreciated as Classic WoW can be a confusing game at times. Thank you.
---
No point in skipping the entry level raid that almost everyone will do.
---
Your video format is great, to the point. People will come back for BWL, ZG and AQ guides. Good way to get a small viewer base for any kind of WoW content you want to make. You might even become the staple guides that every GM has their raid watch. The new Tankspot!
---
I'm struggling to remember his full name, it had demonic at the start as well. I name changed him when we transferred to Zul'jin in WOD :( people usually just called me Demo.
---
i laughed a little when i read this, good troll mate
---
What guild were you raiding with from WOTLK onwards?
---
I think it would be a good idea in theory, and would be beneficial to people who want as authentic as possible vanilla experience. The everquest developers have done this with project 99. Blizzard could give license for people to monetize and distribute a 1.12 client vanilla server without the problems of non profit private servers. Its not going to happen because they are already on track for a legion client emulation. If it ends up being shoddy and not authentic, it would probably still have a reasonable playerbase, but many purists would probably leave. If the Classic project failed completely there is no way they would license the fans to do it, this is not old blizzard with good people in it.
---
You can't overcome anything with extra consumables because assuming you're playing for maximum effect you're already using all of them.
---
Dat ass tho
---
"you can only Need items for your armor style (rogues cant need plate)"
---
This would destroy classic, a lot of specs in the game need items from different armour types. Warriors need leather, paladins need cloth for healing.
---
Yeah, I specifically remember clearing it for easy shoulder enchants I think it was... the tanking one from naxx was better than what TBC offered?
---
If you are alliance I'd say just skip it in general and solo it all later. Bonebiter is alliance only and is just better and you can get it at like lvl 38-40, its from a quest in desolace to kill some skeletons and then chain into SM Cathedral. I dont have any horde weapon progression experience so I can't say. From what I've heard you should get it on horde side because there isn't an equivalent of bonebiter.
---
I think it was Anubis or something close to that, we were pretty small, 20-40 members but we cleared a decent chunk of H ICC 10-man. Now I'm frustrated I never wrote down their names :p my healer friend's name was Bassham and he was in Inertia.
---
It sounds like in your scenario everyone is happy. The dominating side gets to keep dominating and the lower faction gets to leave. Sounds like a win win to me.
---
Probably wasn't sure what to call the video. "Why queue-dodging is bad" doesn't capture the imagination.
---
Imp cleave is a complete waste of talent points. It looks solid on paper, but my understanding is the increase is only on the plus damage from that specific rank. So max rank cleave description: "A sweeping attack that does your weapon damage plus 50 to the target and his nearest ally." That talent bonus only applies to the +50.
---
The real "difficulty" is gearing up yourself alongside 39 others consistently.
---
In naxxramas you need just about every resistance potion, unless im in correct the large AoE anubrekahn does is nature damage. If you fuck this up and get 2 or more stacks you are most likely going to die before your healers reaslise who besides the main tank needs healing. A greater nature resistance potion would be better saved as a reaction. Trust me. By the time you get to naxxramas, vanilla is a game of attrition. This means being smart with consumes :)
---
Hell yes. I want this to expand to atleast BC and WOTLK, that'd be awesome.
---
While Vanilla is fun in its own right, TBC's removed debuff slots allow most classes to have something of a rotation. I know Vanilla Hunters and powershift Feral and...Maybe Rogues do have something more than Mages' "Frostbolt-&gt;Repeat" rotation, but I love the class design and harder raid design of TBC a whole bunch.
---
I just wish Vanilla's longer dungeons were a thing in TBC, as most of them are pretty linear. 
---
To be fair, I never played Vanilla or TBC as much as the other expansions as I was too young, but I did get to see some heroics in TBC and even got taken to Karazhan once which was awesome. 
---
I'd love for TBC and Wotlk servers to become a thing. Either that or some sort of Vanilla+ thing where we get some changes or added content (on TOP of classic itself...Then again I doubt Actiblizz even knows what its fanbase wants beyond "oh nostalgia sells let's resell classic wow people will eat it up")
---
&gt; The audience that played wow during its growing stages from release until mid WOTLK have largely stopped playing and moved on...
---
Why did they stop playing? This is part of my point. I started to play WoW in December 2004, and played (off and on) through Cata. I stopped playing because they game changed in ways that made it less fun for me personally, and this is the case for many others. 
---
&gt;  a newer player base has replaced it of people who prefer the current design. 
---
Yet, that newer player base is far less than the 12 million in WOTLK. Some estimates say the current sub base is 3 or 4 million. It's hard to argue that the reason there are so many less people playing the game now is not because the game is less of a game than it was back then, despite individual preference for retail over classic. 
---
BTW - I'm not saying they should change retail and thereby alienate the current player base, they can leave retail as it is, it is not doing much anyway. I'm saying they should (from a business point of view) put attention and resources into Classic and expand it further. 
---
It is most definitely mandatory if you are in a serious guild. 
---
Slaypa was a good player and person. Everytime I came across them they were pleasant to group with. Troll hunter right?
---
Even then, you'd already have the "oldschool reworked" client that is being made for Classic right now, so it'd still be a small step to take for the money they could charge for it.
---
Heck, charge 20 bucks on top of the subscription and you've got a ton of people playing it while making more money - less than Vanilla? Maybe. But who knows, [redacted] servers are a very bad way to tell interest as most TBC servers so far were buggy or had lots of...Trouble. (Gummy lol)
---
It'd still make more than enough to be worth the effort I reckon.
---
Hey! Thanks man! Just to let you know, this forum post is only a taste of what we've in store. It's simply to put ourselves on the map. There's much more under the hood that we're keeping confidential.
---
As for RP experience, no. It's vanilla WoW, right? We were all RP noobs back then. So let's start from square 1. :)
---
It really isn’t that bad as long as you aren’t wiping a lot. If you are wiping a lot you will hate those responsible a little more than most.
---
My thoughts? You are talking about cancer ways of going around a system to get higher ranked to get PvP gear.
---
The problem is not this cheaty workaround. The real problem is the honor system itself, that causes that sort of cancerous behavior in the first place.
---
This system is old and objectively very toxic in several aspects, and doesn't even rewards skill, or strategy, or implication/preparation. Instead, getting rank 12+  revolves around toxic **direct competition among players of the same faction**, and it rewards cunning behaviors and exploits like you are talking about, and/or pure time investment, as brainless as it can be (like some of the solo players that achieved r14 back in Vanilla).
---
We should better try to propose slightly different systems to Blizzard that remove negative aspects and actually instate positive motivations when trying to grind PvP to get gear.
---
Concretely, **the weekly decay of the PvP points** (whatever they are called) and **the direct dependency of these points between players of the same faction** are the main toxic things to tweak or even completely remove from the system imo.
---
I'm not there to propose any particular solution, I have ideas in mind (and they are far from perfect, though better than the current system), but it would be out of topic to write them there, but my point is to me it's more worth complaining about the system itself which is inherently toxic.
---
I participated in a win trading group on a push for GM. At some point, the people that were paying chinese farmers to farm honor when the acct owner was off line basically forced win trading to even think about competing past R11
---
Between a good DPS set and an excellent tank set the shared gear is only the Satyr's Bow, guild tabard and a shirt. Add to that: FR gear; NR gear and T2 pieces and a stack each of raid-ready consumables... with a travelers backpack in every bank slot and my bank completely full I have just 32 free slots to carry home whatever I pickup along the way for quests, vending, or the auction house.
---
Indeed! He pulled mad dps and we use to do 8 minute heroic runs. The mad man wanted me to single tank KT one time and we nailed it first try. One of my favourite memories.
---
Him and his brother were the last guild I routinely raided with before I started taking breaks from the game. I haven't spoken to him in years sadly.
---
Thanks for the nostalgia trip :)
---
Deserter debuff makes sense. In order to lessen the impact of the change, I also think it might make sense to have it increase in duration every time. For example, the first time you leave a BG, you should get a one minute deserter debuff. The next time, two, then five, then ten, then twenty, then thirty. Once a week when raid lockouts reset they could reset the duration back to one minute.
---
Damn, for some weird reason I thought that was a guide for what raid bosses do before the raid, like drinking, playing dice, and tic tac toe
---
This is true. Take Anub'Rekhan f.ex
---
Locust Swarm in Vanilla deals 1200 damage/2sec to those affected.
---
Locust Swarm in Wrath deals  1313 to 1687 damage/sec to those affected.
---
On top of this, tanks have 3-4x the Health, healers heal a lot more and everyone have personal defensive cooldowns as well as a bunch of defensive utility spells and heals to keep each other alive.
---
Not my video just found it online. 
---
Honestly I dont remember th honor system that well being I didnt hit 60 until BC was about to release. So didnt pvp much until TBC. 
---
Yeah because tbc will be out.
---
Maximize your sum net threat-per-second and sum net threat-per-rage simultaneously while marking primary[skull] and secondary[cross] DPS targets; polymorph[moon]; mesmerize[star]; and occasionally also hunter ice trap[blue square] and off-tank[condom] targets for each pull as needed and maintain an extensive social network on the server so as to have *a talent pool* to draw upon should you need to replace any other roll at any time for whatever reason.
---
Try /r/kindergarten
---
Me and two friends were succesfully running weekly Naxx25 pugs for months. This was before Ulduar even released. Wotlk version was a joke.
---
I would not block the ninja aspect. Only one roll would break loot trading. The problem arises when people fake-need and then gold sell the item afterwards...
---
I mean to be fair, private server peeps have been shut down time and time again when they asked blizzard for a legacy option. Id be lying if i didnt turn a bit elitist and toxic at retailers who didnt have to scrape and and beg for the game they loved.
---
Most of the more toxic personalities from PServers will stay on PServers. I don't expect many of them to actually opt to pay for something, nor the very real liklihood of getting banned. 
---
I used to take flight paths for fun sometimes because the world was so cool looking, even though I was a mage
---
Those "side quests" are your toon's story. Your character is trying to make their way in the world as an adventurer, they're not *stuck* playing out the role of a protagonist in some high fantasy storyline.
---
Which is great, because every time Blizzard has tried to tell that kind of story with WoW it's sucked. When I've tried new expansions and Blizzard forces me to slog through their hackneyed dialog and boring cutscenes I get angry that the game won't let me go freely out into the world and explore. It's all a matter of perspective.
---
At any rate, as you get closer to level 60, you start to see quest lines of more significance (imagine that! Actual pacing!). Getting attuned for Onyxia was a blast. And even though "kill X spiders" is an obvious formula, if you focus on the quest _chains_ you'll find some fun, epic stuff.
---
And if you don't like the quests, here's twelve different ways to have fun that aren't questing:
---
1. Go find some mobs to grind on. Ideally, you'll find some that drop helpful items.
---
2. Level up your secondary or primary professions
---
3. Get your weapon skills up to max
---
4. Queue for BGs
---
5. Engage in open world PvP
---
6. Get in a dungeon group
---
7. Explore in search of some of the secret zones
---
8. Work the auction house
---
9. Level an alt to give you access to more professions
---
10. Compete in the fishing event
---
11. Farm mats to craft better gear or consumables
---
12. Help out your guildies with any of the above
---
If you can't find anything to do in the game that's fun, maybe Classic WoW isn't for you.
---
This is not correct. There are DR's in PvE in Vanilla.
---
The toughest AOE tanking is when there are one or more casters who will not abide by the regular demo/thunderclap mechanics. Shoot one and pull it *along with the entire pull* around the corner. Preferably designate one caster to be polymorphed[moon] and one to be focus-fired on until dead[skull] so you have time to sunder at least three of the elite mobs to be AOE'd in case of non-elites e.g. insects either spam demo shout or even invest in a [Julie's Dagger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6660/julies-dagger) with *Lifestealing* enchantment theory being self-healing in close proximity is the most rage-efficient net sum aggro generator for more than four simultaneous mobs.
---
They are giving us the game for free pretty much. Servers cost, how do you suppose they will make
---
Money from Classic. 
---
I have this sinking feeling it will be riddled with micro transactions, as well as the token making it a pay to win mess. 
---
I really really hope not tho. I don’t plan on playing retail again after classic is out. 
---
My first observation looking at this is noticing a lot of European Alliance respondents.  
---
I had a joke about pathetic honorless surrender monkeys in here somewhere, but I'm trying to cut low-hanging fruit out of my diet.
---
I probably will. But I played for 2 years and didnt even get to Naxxramas when Vanilla was Retail. I'm going to get quite a few hours of fun out of this.
---
Check your spelling before you post something. There's a half dozen errors in your comments in this thread.  
---
You're right, honor system was complete and utter shit that not only promoted toxicity and playing the system (like OP points out), but was also downright unhealthy on the high competition servers where you'd have to sacrifice lots of sleep for weeks if not months. A system like this would not be acceptable if released today.
---
That said there's really no easy solution, and conversation about it is impossible because of people trying to defend it based on their fond memories of farming up to rank 6... 12 years ago.
---
Judgement of wisdom is pretty tits.
---
That's a lot of ale.
---
Thanks for the link, couldn’t find any relevant information though. 
---
But, on a legit note, what’s the deal? Y’all tell people who don’t want to PvP to fuck off to a PvE Realm, but when we ask questions regarding how things work on PvE Realms you follow along for the sake of mocking..? I get the feeling you’re one of the people who says ganking is a huge part of the experience, likely because you seek out realms that are an 80/20 balance slanted to your faction, right?
---
"When you make eye contact with a white person."
---
Chillin, smilin' rasta lion! Can't wait to have you protect me again!
---
:]
---
Yes thank you for a detailed response of the crazy honor system of vanilla. I think changing decay itself could help. People saying "oh it should be rare because the people that have no job for 3 months deserve it". Absolute insanity to think that way. Playing a hero for 18hours for 3 months purely for pvp sounds like it caters to a very particular crowd.  
---
Honor can/should still be the effort/time you put in but no decay imo
---
:}
---
Unless your guild is making both of the hunters melee with nightfall a Ret paladin that is swapping between nightfall/ashkandi+ is going to bring some decent value to the raid. Warrior off tanks have to maintain the annihilator debuff, the Ret paladin lets them focus on dps/threat more.
---
You will level faster if you're dying less because you'll spend less time rage quitting after the 5th respawning "dickish whateverthefuck" kills you right when you loot the box at the end of the tunnel.  
---
It's not hard, because it's not difficult to execute. Even with the limited tools classes have, it's really not that difficult to deal with.
---
It requires a lot of time, but that doesn't make it hard.
---
Channeled spells are like dots and as such cannot crit. Not sure if you meant to talk about the stun proc though
---
I must be hitting hard as fuck if it takes me so long to find intact Mountain Lion Blood.
---
Its literally the only thing I would change about the game.
---
The honor system absolutely should get changed. The old system can still exist as a way for soloq players to drown their life in the mindless grind. But there needs to be a sepperate Q for competitive BG's with its own ranks and rewards.
---
What were those populations like? I don't think we need loot trading, I was just mentioning how the super servers don't seem to have as much self policing as retail vanilla had. I think the most blacklisting I saw was the few people who ranked higher in pvp than what they were supposed to
---
Are you intentionally being dense or what?
---
Bob the rogue join UBRS to get Dal'Rend Swords.
---
Jim the rogue join UBRS to get Dal'Rend Swords.
---
Jim's friend, Tim and Jill join UBRS to get Flask of Titans. Tim and Jill already have Dal'Rend, but equipt a slightly worse weapon. Every player is a rogue.
---
Normally Bob and Jim would have a 50% chance to get the sword upon drop. Instead, Tim and Jill also roll, which means Jim now has a 75% chance of getting the weapon.
---
Tim wins, and you demand that Tim equip it so you can inspect him. Tim equip the weapon he has in his bags already.
---
So how exactly can you tell? You cant.
---
Pretty sure you are right, one thing though: voidwalker will be dead after 3-4 hits from an elite mob so there is not much tanking. I guess having it out for the sacrifice is good but doing that every pull will drain your shards quickly (also expensive to cast and 10sec cast) and we are talking about speed farming here
---
Pvpers seek out the lower populated side for various reasons.
---
Lower q time.
---
More targets.
---
Less competition for ranks.
---

U got denny'd m8
---
No way. You are wrong about some servers being pay to win. Except the ones that he admits exist, but now you picked the wrong server, even though you were wrong about those servers existing. 
---
It was posted a day ago. I think it should be changed as Ohhgee suggests. Mostly because it is essentially cheating the system in order to gain honor, which should be punishable by the ToS. I think Blizzard will end up taking action against these cheaters either by banning people who choose to do this and get reported/caught, or they will just implement the deserter debuff to save themselves some work.
---
As a good post recent reddit post memed it, you can also literally have a few empty slots in your raid and still do content. Having 38 people and 2 offspecs is obviously going to work if you can make a 39 normal raid with 1 afk. And this is still overexagerrated. Suboptimal raids were common in Vanilla. We still cleared a lot of content despite that. Naxx hardest bosses aren't the only raid available. And I can remember several times to have people afk because of bad connection, or because problems but the RL not bothering to find someone else.
---
I played a tank from vanilla through cataclysm. I quit a couple weeks after they removed threat mechanics - it felt like half of the game was just taken out in one minor patch.
---
FYI Shammy tank is viable until late game. If it's what you want to do, go for it. I always enjoy instancing with a good shammy tank. ^^
---
Pretty much.
---
I know - I was throwing out basic mechanic changes that could be part of a fix.  Obviously it would require a hell of a lot of brainstorming beyond that.  I don't know - put an xmute station that morphs toons into tanks for the fight. 
---
U sure it's 3-4 hits, i was thinking 5-7 hits tbh, like at lvl 45 (zul farak) mobs should deal 350-450 dmg (https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5648) - I couldn't find the voidwalkers health but should be 2.2k-2.5k or so. So that should be ~ 6 hits which is 9 seconds, with a second dps u should be able to kill them with in that time (4k hp, means each dps has to do ~ 120 dps a second aoe) this is not counting that voidwalker has speels too to surive even longer aswell and the priest can actually just give the pets a heal too and we should be good to go with the pets not dying before the pull is over.
---
Sounds like you should play on a pve server
---
It's hard to do without knowing how they are going to do itemization and also how weapon skill is going to work in classic
---
https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12fca6a80be4965f706a27dd61c61ed2fd004e0879979e4d228bae59460b56c95f1a0e1f1a064f68afe80316721664e587ef643e61c74a3cf7fb7bbe6c2fd119b28486185814b0e627f92467600673bebf52c99fa1b5f9a7a9620a1821c760798591bc10c5641e349fa6bd4db37d1209ce78158b17a8cfb020fb642e5f7a7d76707892575e01041252b0cc544899274e70e68bedfe8faa8c0282d8ee41ac1d62c2689b0aa65ce
---
something like that but again it depends. 
---
I ranked to 10 on a pve server in 06. It's not really any different except the pool for premades will be  smaller.
---
I love organic pvp too much to roll there again but if bgs is all you want, a normal server is fine. Ranking is easier ofc on a pve server since therw are less total pvpers contributing. So there is that.
---
Why skip rend? It does way better damage for its cost than heroic strike and it doesnt block rage regeneration like heroic strike does
---
Those are definitely a handful of good looking pixels! 
---
Damn the top one looks really awesome! Where is it from? 
---
Cool, whats the best way of keeping up to speed on the latest news? Do you have a website or discord or something?
---
Blizzard tarnished the meaning of "legendary" in Legion with the artifact system despite how many praise it. At least FFXIV has been doing it proper since ARR.
---
I am geared for pretty much pure strength/stam/crit.  Some int here and there.  A few pieces I remember off the top of my head. 
---
Might of Menethil
---
Barbed choker
---
Crown of destruction
---
Gauntlets of Kalimdor
---
Drake Fang Talisman
---
Malfurion Blessed Bulwark
---
Can't remember anything else off the top of my head.  It's kind of a random mix but mostly heavy on STR. 
---
The game is download only. You have to subscribe to BfA and maintain that subscription in order to have access to it. I can't believe you're so naive to think it'll be a standalone game sold in stores.
---
Thanks :D I plan on taking it as far as I can :) without negatively impacting the enjoyment of my group members. I've always loved the theme of shamans and wished they'd make a dedicated tank spec for them, I think this will be as close as I get. 
---
I don't think they should change the game because someone doesn't like a certain aspect of it. That'll just end up with hundreds of changes and a completely different game. 
---
hidden skin for the retribution paladin artifact weapon
---
Thank you. You just helped me make a hard choice of what is more important. It became a very easy choice.
---
I'll never understand why people like extremely ridiculous weapons like these. At least the old Ashbringer kind of looks like something that would cut an opponent, the new Ashbringer is a total joke that wouldn't even kill a naked man.
---
Feral is one of those "meme specs" that is actually good on certain fights if played well. I recommend following [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNBNhIAeMwFrCEFM10Koaw) for guides on that, the dude raided all the way up to naxx on REDACTED servers and it definetly works, even if it requires a ton of effort on your part.
---
One of my favorite weapons!
---
Name a single private realm that has had a healthy population for two straight years. 
---
Probably our [Discord](https://discord.gg/BGQ4Z9e).
---
What happened to my “nostalgic high horse”? I’m confused. It’s almost like you’re admitting you were full of it. 
---
Alright, I kind of figured as much, but I was hoping for someone to actually comment and say as much. Thanks for the insight :)
---
Clever. Funny. Upvote. 
---
This is a legitimate argument, but I don't think this will happen nearly as often as people think it will. 
---
Frankly, I don't care one way or the other.  I just want to play in Pre-cataclysm Azeroth. 
---
There has to be a way of losing points or everyone will be rank 14 after 2 years. But losing points should be based on performance, not just time investment.
---
I upvoted, I am ashamed
---
Since every expansion of WoW is essentially a new take on the same game's *very* core premise: Hit buttons, kill enemies and loot them, preferably with others, I never ever will get how people tell me that me liking a certain iteration of that is just "nostalgia". 
---
I still enjoy some older games more than some newer ones, not because I played 'em exclusively as a kid and am nostalgic, nor because "all new games are bad" but because I just genuinely like the way a specific game's structured.
---
Vanilla has the RPG aspect down to a tee, the whole world feels interconnected and the dungeons feels like huge worlds inthemselves. Every class feels incredibly unique, even Horde and Alliance have differences, love it.
---
TBC took Vanilla and made it more balanced without completely destroying its core ideas, while trying to make raids more accessible. While that did kill some raids going from 40 to 25 men and people were afraid of them being too simple because of that, they became mechanically much more involved, while keeping all of the RPG mechanics like resistances being a thing. I'd personally love a Classic TBC the most I think, as I love the additions to classes a whole lot and really enjoy dungeonbosses also having fun mechanics.
---
Wotlk - while having a way too easy start - was still incredibly enjoyable, but I did not enjoy how the support classes were almost killed. Sure, Demolock was still a thing with its SP buff, but "bring the player not the class" suddenly became a mantra. We also got the first lazy raid in WoW's history IMO: Trial of the Crusader's just boring. In contrast, Ulduar and ICC are awesome and some other additions like even more class changes made some really fun rotations. I love Wotlk prot warrior and every single Shaman spec so much, and many others look fun as hell.
---
I could go on and on, every expansion (even Cata, MoP and Legion) have had lots to enjoy for me atleast, but they *are* very different. It's definetly not just nostalgia, I loved WoW a whole lot back in those first 3 expansions especially, and would love to see a classic version for all 3.
---
The can be extremely toxic. And the justify this with Blizzard shitting on them for 10 years for not giving them what they wanted. They're the exact same way now, if it isn't an exact Nostalrius replica they threaten to boycott the whole things.
---
So on top of being toxic they are also entitled and believe themselves to be way more important than they actually are. 
---
The populations were lower than nostalrius and such, only a few thousand on the server at peak times. But the Ironforge and Orgrimmar culture quickly spread who’s bad and not. 
---
Obviously it’s not a perfect system but nothing is and loot trading will only exacerbate the problem.  
---
Yeah dude it’s Blizzard. They always do stuff like this. They already announced early level sharding and loot trading. 
---
Other then the standard stuff like cloth farming, regular quests in the zone, then u can go for the really long blasted lands questline.
---
It's 17 quests (7 of them is in Azshara) this requires groupsor someone in the zone that wanna help you with the elites, but it can be quite fun.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2801
---
r/wow has a lot of people being sad about the current state of the game. It's quite disheartening, the longer Legion went on the more it seemed to correct its course.
---
Wow awesome thank you!
---
Didn't we get like a boatload of info like two months ago? 
---
Combat isn’t ideal, but you can make it work.  At the highest ranks though you won’t be able to really push the best players as combat - snare breakers and burst damage dominate rogue usefulness in pvp in vanilla.
---
my favorite wow track
---
Classic will not be free, it will require a monthly subscription cost. It will be included with the retail subscription. Many people who will be playing classic when it comes out don't have a retail subscription. So Blizzard will make money on the new subscribers. This is what they are banking on, why else would they be re-launching classic. 
---
&gt; This sub is full of Blizzard true believers.
---
Seriously? Go to *any* discussion thread here and post something like "I don't trust blizzard to make ANY changes to classic" &amp; you'll rake in upvotes. 
---
Thank you!  
---
With the lack of information we have so far, I'm creating "jump off" points with this data.  
---
Basically I'm making a data set that is not 100% accurate as a starting point, and as we learn more I will modify my data to be accurate. This provides me a great jump off point for ret.
