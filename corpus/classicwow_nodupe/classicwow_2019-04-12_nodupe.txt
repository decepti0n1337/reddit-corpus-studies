That i can understand but to have to take leave is strange, what if one want to keep saving their leave until the next year!

---
---
&gt; So you think having 2 hour queues isn't important? Or Blizzard putting blanket xrealm bgs in isn't important?
---

---
Nope.  Neither one of them is important.  You liking one does not make it more important than the guy who doesn't like it.  Your desire does not make it more important.  This is my whole point.  YOU wanting it to be important does not actually make it important.  
---
&gt; I'm very willing to change my mind, 
---
No you aren't.  If a thousand people show up and say, "We love 2 hour queues!", you are absolutely NOT going to change your mind.  Stop lying.  This is why your whole important discussion is pointless.
---
Did you ever have a "good samaritan" saying in public chat or whisper that it was on the AH for cheaper than you were offering? And if so what did you do?
---
[Release date]
---
I definitely agree about Phase 2 length, but even if it's only a month, people will want to push *very* hard for those Bracket 1 spots; which might make it worse for those 4 weeks, but of course better in the long run for the health of the server. 
---
Blizzard, nor I, know exactly what will happen, but the one thing I do know is that certain Guilds during Phase 2 are going to have a very negative impact on the servers overall health &amp; population.
---
I’ve been keybinding since diablo 2 and haven’t been a clicker since.
---
What about the possibility of low populations and lack of people to fill spots.
---
Or that most most people with desire to play classic played vanilla, meaning they are adults now, with responsibilities and less time to farm. And when the nostalgia wears off they remember that they have done all this before and that this game is a giant time suck. Then they leave and the game dies.

I have a lot of respect for people that use "dank" and "edgelord"

Pretty sure their red hot pokers as those were used to actually torture people.

And my axe!

PS, what class/faction/region are you rolling? You might wanna roll with us (very similar no-life to yours) if you don't have some buddies.
---
That would be the dream. I might try to go for it. Thx
---
This is suppose to be a simulation of vanilla. This isn't blizzard like.

 This is what you wrote

"A large majority won’t be expecting a pre-BG Vanilla and will be heavily disappointed. "
---
I always thought the D in DKP was dungeon not dragon. Huh.
---
Good thing this isn't China!
---
If you don't think that having no pvp server community isn't important, or that having 2 hour BG queues isn't important, then I'm sorry. You mustn't think bgs as a whole are important.  
---
Find me one person who likes 2 hour queues. I bet you can't do it, and it's because it just sucks. Nobody enjoys playing a game where you have to wait 2 hours to play. Nobody.
---
The discussion to be had isn't whether 2 hour queues are good or not, it's about how Blizzard is going to deal with that issue. As much as you think waiting for 2 hours to play a game isn't a bad thing, it really is. If you made a game and said "hey guys, I made this fun game that makes you wait 2 hours every time you want to play!" Nobody would buy it. Because it just sucks.
---
Normally in public chat every so often. I would just ignore them. You'd be amazed at how often it still worked.
---
fuck you and your racist sheet
---
someone here sure can give you a viable spec for both or try here https://discord.gg/erjzww
---
In casual guilds, knowing *how* to play your class / spec is much more important than the exact class/spec/race/whatever combo. And being social in your guild. For casuals, if they like you and you're around at raid time, you'll get invites. Most casual guilds are working to fill raid spots - many even picking up a random from /2 to fill out some roles.
---
Warrior or Rogue/Alliance/NA, although I already have a Guild I'm committed to playing with. Thanks though!
---
I think the ideal to Blizz is having these certain guilds square up against each other. But of course we know they’re gonna be preying on the lumps that are level 48 warriors (me). It’ll be a good month of working on my alt and running ZF over and over lol.
---
I hope he's just memeing
---
\+15 heal and 1% crit
---
Or the other healing chest from the same boss with +68 healing.
---
Hmmm :D
---
Dope, good luck. Better hope you're not rolling alliance rogue on the server I choose, because I'm 100% getting server first rank 14 rogue =PP.
---
Don't neglect ur kid for a video game bro :(
---
I played twinks,  and I remember amongst the twink community if you were a clicker you were considered terrible.  so I started to keybind to not be considerred bad by twink comrades.
---
&gt;Funny to see people excited about this when looking like a clown was absolutely fucking hated in Vanilla.
---
Ofcourse nobody LIKES their character looking like they crawled out of a compost toilet. But it makes getting good gear so much more rewarding in turn.
---
sad
---
You can't win here my man. They want everything to be exactly how it was. I'm with you. Cosmetic changes don't have an affect on game play but that's not what they care about it.
---
These are really nice dude, keep them up.
---
I agree. I know i don't have the same time as I did. The parts of classic I want to relive is pvp and raids. Not farming for hours so I can change builds and then being stuck with it or feeling like I'm not maximizing my character becuse i have to go hybrid.
---
Hey Xetoll, stumbled across this PhD a player wrote about their experience with Stoic / WarEnsemble:     
---
https://docdro.id/DQLPND5
---
My biggest concern is with keeping players around. I think a lot of people will want to BG both while leveling and at max level. That's just my opinion.
---
Personally, I've heard a lot of complaints about releasing 1.12 itemized PvP gear halfway through Molten Core.  The gear can be competitive with gear from Naxx for some classes.
---
Yeah it's impossible for Blizzard to force these Guilds to play on the same server, and I kinda doubt they will. Who knows though.
---
the sheet tab for BRD.
---
lmao
---
I clicked ever since I was young (Born in 2001), when I joined a private server I just thought I should get used to key binding from level 1.
---
The first year of a babies life is much easier than the next 3 years.  Things get better around age 5.   
---
One could easily grind r14 with a new baby.   One could not grind r14 with a baby that walks around the house.
---
Lol me too on the Earthen Ring and it was a hunter as well! Weird..... That was the loudest vent had ever been...
---
This dude from Stoic / WarEnsemble wrote a whole PhD dissertation about his buddies and experiences on Shattered Hand:        
---
Well of course the other confounding factor to this issue is how many servers are there gonna be?
---
Whether you like it or not, isn't the point. This isn't going to kill classic. There is no indication at all there will be a exodus because of it. If anything, more people have faith in blizzard. The PvP phase system is the highest praised on this subreddit thing since it mimics blizzards actual system.
---
110% or they'll invite you and kick you when they find out you aren't gunna heal.
---
Anal spam was never in vanilla, it started around mid tbc when it became possible to link skills in chat...
---
Already noticed a few errors for druid stuff, mostly correct though (90% or so)
---
4? My first guild was a bunch of off spec mouth breathers. It took 2 4 hour nights to clear MC.
---
Here you go: [https://i.imgur.com/0Pfed8P.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0Pfed8P.jpg)
---
Good point. I think Blizzard stated somewhere already that it there will be a lesser amount of servers available at first and add more as necessary, similar to Vanillas original launch and timeline.
---
Should be fun if so!
---
[removed]
---
That isn't how subs work....
---
Guarantee most of the "vanilla purists" either never played much at 60, never played vanilla, or will drop classic halfway through because they forgot how tedious it was.
---
Pretty much. Slow as hell, verfy few attacks. Your basically a buff bot with shitty damage who stands there and swings. I never understood it either. I understand it even less with people going in knowing what it is and wanting to do it.
---
I mean, you can wear mail outside a raid and put on better gear inside a raid. Nothing will stop you from doing that. In the end, raiding is about a 40 person team which each individual tries to do their best to help what becomes their family progress. Do I like the way my pre-raid BIS looks in raid? Not really, but if it means I can help any way I can, I will do it every time.
---
Now do it again, but add mageweave cloth/bandages
---
Honestly? do PVP. It wasn't a coincidence that the top PVP players were also good raiders but not the other way around. PVP trains you for adapting to unexpected situations since that's all it is, and it trains you to get used to every single tool in your arsenal, not just your rotations.
---
Why not?
---
ZG and AQ20 are great pug raids. MC is hit or miss. Not because it's hard, but it's hard to organize 40 people. Same goes for BWL. If I we're you, I would join a casual raiding guild that raids one day a week and doesn't put too much strain on the raiders when it comes to consumables and world buffs. Honestly, it's more enjoyable to play that way anyway. It might take you longer to do things, but it makes the game feel more fun and less like a job.
---
I want to take time and smell the peacebloom anyway.
---
The first week or two is going to be disgusting anyway.
---
My time off work are the three weeks in the middle of July. If Classic drops July 16th my summer is going to rock! If it drops early-mid August my life is kinda fucked, I've been waiting 10 years for this.
---
I know whats gonna happen post-naxx. The infinite dragonflight is reemerging in retail Lore, as well as the deaths of chromi event happening recently. It seems so obvious to me... Classic wow is just the continuation of retail, some major lore event will happen and Azeroth will be changed dramatically. We'll travel back in time from classic, and an entirely new expansion cycle will unfold. WoW is definitely not dying anytime soon anyways, so I believe this is there move.
---
I'd think it is dependent on your play style. Speccing into Illumination and stacking crit works great with spamming flash of light (which scales poorly with spell power).
---
Be gone thot
---
Yeah definitely go for a pure dps class. Dps is easier to pug in and out than to be one of the main healers, and we don't even need to talk about tanking.
---
Not really underrated, it's widely considered the best alliance pvp racial, and the 2nd strongest pvp racial overall. (WOTF is still king)
---
Authentic Vanilla experience is important. Blizzard is taking Phase 6 weapons and putting them in phase 3. They are being lazy and it is the wrong thing to do.
---
Talents that directly boost your survivability are just as valuable as talents that boost dps. So 5% crit talent is nice, but so is the Parry and Dodge talents, since while they dont speed up kills, they reduce down time.
---
Lol my first thought as well.
---
&gt;the best thing to vendor to generate raw gold **early on** is bandages imo
---
Then I go to show that **early on**, this isn't a good idea.
---
&gt;Now do it again, but add mageweave cloth/bandages
---
Level 45+ is "early on" now?
---
This is very cool. It will take me some time to digest it. 
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Okay. I'm going to play regardless.
---
People have told me I'm wrong before:  https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/honor-system-should-be-released-in-phase-1/145650
---
If blizzard literally doesnt send me to 2004 then theyve made a huge mistake.
---
It mostly is yes, they aren't useful for PvE aside from leveling and grinding but they have some place in PvP.
---
So grow out your hair?
---
What has already been said, being casual will not mean you will never do the content, it will just take longer to get there. There is no real catch up mechanics so you have to go through the content.
---
I would sugest finding a friendly guild with a good culture and be consistant, it will put you in line to get gear.
---
I would think the community will be a friendly one so ppl will be helpful.
---
It's been a month! How is the full map going, friend? Woo!
---
I live in Japan too and its seems a west coast based US realm offers the best ping.
---
I've  started a guild for people who want to play and raid at odd hours, all are welcome.

Blade Flurry and Adrenaline Rush are two more great reasons to keep going straight up the Combat tree for leveling. Those two talents are especially useful when leveling, since they give you the unique ability to power your way through groups of mobs or a tough elite mob that might otherwise prevent you from completing a quest.

I’m split on whether or not I want them. 
---
The instant queues were great, but just like lfg/lfr it killed player interaction. I would rather they merged servers to keep the population about even.
---
Well honestly I think a classic branch on the WoW website with posts would be a better alternative to posting on the forums, it would be a lot clearer and easier to find. Just like https://oldschool.runescape.com/ has and the official WoW site.
---
Ah yes, the "Orc or Human no other matters" comment should have included "for weapon skill calc"
---
I've removed that comment now.
---
Lol my seconds thought as well.
---
Nice, I was on that server :)
---
That’s true... but not putting points into riposte won’t keep you from getting them any faster than usual. I meant it in the sense that putting points into riposte won’t delay other key abilities or talents around the same level.
---
I never said to stop putting points into combat after riposte, just that there aren’t other talents that are exactly worth rushing straight for at that level range.
---
And in game they are daggers. On. Fire.
---
Fist weapons have always been the absolute coolest to me.  It’s too bad they’re not at all relevant in Classic.
---
Thank you
---
Umm you need to find a twink community, if you are wanting to queue good bgs in the twink brackets. Most people don't queue bgs while they level, so it's kind of a given that bg queues will be a lot higher in those leveling brackets, unless twinks have some games organized.
---
These are so cool! If you wind up doing the other classes, I hope you do Druid T2. SOOOO badly want to see that : )
---
To be fair, you didn't need a whole lot of interaction for BGs to pop before xrealm, it was still a queue. You do however lose that knit pvp server community. 
---
The argument against mixing servers is that suddenly a closely knit community has an influx of strangers. This however I think would resolve with time as people got to know each other.
---
Another solution is larger servers. The argument against this is that the server feels more like a city than a small town. 
---
There's definitely a balance. I'm not 100% sold on cross server either, and ide love to see a solution that works and doesn't include anything cross server.
---
I won the lottery last year, literally. Safe to say that I'm not going to work a job in many years to come, unless it's for passion/fun. Financially speaking I probably don't have to work for the rest of my life. So I will be playing this game like never before, absolutely stoked about being able to put in crazy hours this time around without having to feel about it. I was way too busy with college back in 2005, so this is going to be absolutely amazing.
---
Or do lionheart helm, its just as, if not more iconic
---
People asked for classic, why ruin it with pointless changes like these? If you don't like the features in classic theres allways BFA for you with 5min HS cd etc...
---
There were people in my guild who absolutely hated looking at their character. There was nothing rewarding about farming a piece for weeks or months and then looking like shit once you got it.
---
Hunter
---
Oh hi mark!
---
Lmao the memories
---
I disagree with a lot that guy said. Bwl/zg gear is actually really great for ele shaman. Its really all about the crits since the ele talent elemental fury gives 100% inc crit damage bonus and you get 10% flat crit from talents. Thats why ele is considered such a bursty class. They crit a lot and they crit very hard. Between t2, zg and the blue pvp set you can find plenty of mail gear with decent spell power plus spell crit. Not to mention most of your spell power will come from your weapon (lok'amir) and the trinkets from bwl/zg. 
---
A lot of people dont think ele is good till t2.5 because thats where the gear really shines. A ton of spell power and crit. But you can certainly do really well before aq. Also full t2.5 is considered bis for resto. So its not that other classes dont want t2.5 tokens, its that its so good on resto sham they get priority. And it doubles as bis for ele (in pvp at least). 
---
Imo shaman is one of the easiest to raid as resto and offgear your ele. There is a decent amount of overlap of gear. Lokamir is bis for both ele and resto. The bwl trinket is good for both. You can easily just go for full t2 set and heal just fine and play ele in the same gear. And all spell power mail gear will just be rolled as offspecs anyway.
---
You are asking about xrbg - I'm saying that helped kill WPvP because people could queue up and get in a BG faster with xrbg.
---
Filthy rogue! You're lucky I'm a forsaken player too or I'd hamstring your neck tendons and feast upon your rotting skimpy rogue muscles!
---
Why not what?
---
Lvl 19 rogue is where its at.
---
I farmed with a lvl 60 the shadow dungeon in the horde area for the main hand.
---
The worst part, was trying not to accidentally level up. You cant lose XP, so it's a dangerous game.
---
Oh I see, I read what you said to mean that you hope faster queues discourage xrealm bgs, as opposed to wpvp. Yes 100% I'm on the wpvp wagon and would love to see more of that.
---
Twinks make up about half the players in BGs, but regardless there were no ABs or WSGs in any bracket for almost 2hrs tonight.
---
Honestly each phase should have had a war event associated with it. This lets the servers progress fairly.
---
Instruction unclear, child has died of hunger
---
You... can't. The honor system *is* the ranking system. The only thing that is coming later is battlegrounds.
---
You also get the benefit of handy barrens flight paths off the bat
---
Or better yet, go on a real vacation and come back to the 15 year old game that you will be burned out from in a few weeks.
---
Keep calm and...

---
Trollbane was a pve server on NA (I think, I had some RL buds play on there), I assume it was also on EU? From what I'm gathering is that PvE servers were the ones that primarily had bad queue times due to the nature of the server and possibly imbalance (typically more alliance on pve servers, etc).
---
In my experience (on actual vanilla), crbgs increased my queue times for bgs, but most likely made queue times a little less as a whole for other servers. The only reason I wanted to queue bgs once crbgs came out, was to queue against my pve rl friends, other than that though I quit caring. They didn't matter as much, since it removed a huge community aspect.
---
I love builds like this. Im doing a leech/lifestealing warrior 2h off tank build myself. Im up to 150+ HP / 5 seconds with gear available in AQ patch. Not including potions, rube tubers, healthstones and Lifestealing enchant. Don't go meta! If you have an interesting idea just go for it and do everything you can to make it work!
---
Maybe I could join one of those as a backup raider? I literally can't even commit to one day a week with how medical school works. It'd be fine with me if I got passed up and only got to join once in a while like some other people were saying.
---
Did you play on a server that tried to simulate the world pvp era (no bg) like blizzard is going to? 
---
My experience on such a server was not as bad as you say. I did level up in phase 1 though. 
---
Blizzard is making alot other compromises on the whole authentic Vanilla experience so WSG in Phase 2 is a good idea.
---
You can't lock your XP in Vanilla but you don't get XP from battlegrounds either.
---
definetly not. It went: Dwarf, then sexy elf, then troll, then sexy wizard. My adolescent brain installed this software too many times to forget the disk sleeves
---
&gt; The issue is, as someone stated on here earlier, if the faction imbalance is big enough BGs sometimes don't happen. 
---
The same way world boss kills don't happen on that server for smaller faction.
---
It's kind of busted, the overpopulated side wants quicker queues, while also reaping the benefits of being the dominant faction. Meanwhile the less dominant faction gets hit with increased queue times for bgs, and they still don't get to compete for world bosses, because crbgs did nothing to fix the actual problem.
---
(This is another argument people have on this topic, which is extremely vaild)
---
XP for PvP didn't come in until patch 3.2 or 3.3 iirc, so you can twink to your heart's content
---
I can't say that I have, but the top/very try hard private server Guilds were not on that server if I'm thinking of the same one. Agreed, it's not going to be 100% authentic Vanilla, everyone knew this from the get go, so I think this a compromise that's worth it to maintain server health &amp; population. World PvP won't take much of a hit, if at all with just WSG in.
---
I think you bring up a lot of good points, but one of the main reasons you want to include WSG is to "keep casuals from quitting". This project doesn't hinge on the casuals. It's to recreate WoW the best we can and doing this would be a slap in the face to everyone who has been working so hard to get us here. I have to admit I was saddened not to see an earlier version of AV, but it would be nowhere near as destructive to the project as having an earlier and thus "pro changes" WSG. No. We can't just include what we want.
---
Watch the intro video when you make a character instead of skipping it.
---
Because not many people queue bgs at lower levels. People know to be competitive you need to be the upper level of the bracket, and even then they just want to level to 60.
---
It's expected to have increased queue times. I remember, even WELL after xrbgs were introduced, people had to set up low level bgs on forums to get them to pop.
---
Gear of purple color quit being rare about 1/3 of the way through vanilla. I'll never understand this mentality.
---
Also how great is it that they die to Nature dmg too. hahah perfect
---
Fuck the hooves give me what happened to mankirk's wife
---
They've already stated they are putting in sharding for the initial starting zones. I'm 100% positive that it wont be as bad as private servers are right now.
---
Nihilum didn’t use voice chat till late TBC.
---
So was I. I had completely forgotten about copperfield’s antics. So many good guilds and so much drama when they split near the end.
---
Thats reason enough to roll horde tbh. Alliance has such a hard time doing SM.
---
Well as thought third my lol.
---
These are awesome man. Love OC on here
---
I actually played in vanilla. And I've played private servers (nost, knos, scraft, etc). I had &lt;5min queues in every version I've played (from actual vanilla to pservers).
---
You're argument: "I mean lots of the game wasn't part of vanilla as a whole. Naxx wasn't part of much of vanilla, should we exclude that?"... Is missing the point, or you've just failed to comprehend what the guy you replied to is attempting to say. He's saying, crbgs weren't in vanilla except for a small portion at the very end. So therefore he doesn't think crbgs should be in classic, at least until way later phases (like phase 6). This is how blizz has stated they will handle other content (ie, Naxx) so it should be assumed that yes, we will probably get crbgs, but hopefully not until a later phase. This would allow a strong community to build, before the pvp community is kinda mishmashed with random no-namers on other servers (like what happened in actual vanilla).
---
Also, advocating for having CRBGs in the game from the start, would be like saying Naxx should also be in there from start, because they were both in vanilla (even though they both occurred toward the end of vanilla).
---
Hope this makes sense, It's kinda what he was trying to say I think, lol.
---
The more I think about this, the more I lean towards merging servers with opposite faction imbalances. The argument against this is that a knit community suddenly has an influx of strangers, but I think that would resolve itself with time. The main issue is that it might push the total server pop too high.
---
 Lol my third thought as well.
---
Awesome I can make a copy and add it to my 100s of other spreadsheets about vanilla I keep saving
---
Don't be so damn anal!
---
It wasn’t that bad. You did have to bring a crew with you for sure.
---
Exp from bgs came in wrath of the lich king.
---
I have PTSD from trying to run through Plaguelands and through Bulwark as a level 36.
---
And if the group felt very brave they would go through Silverpine, and try to get past Undercity as a fresh zeppelin full of bloodthirsty level 60 horde rain down from the sky all around you.
---
Thanks man!!
---
It was a mid pop EU PVP server, queue times decreased massively for us. Without CRBGs there's a chance of the awful queue times coming back and if that's the case I'll lose interest in WoW shortly after hitting 60.
---
Haha I do remember doing some swimming in Silverpine. Gotta take those backroads. Zig, zag, bob, and weave. 
---
RFK trying to get Corpsemaker was a good time too.
---
Nothing in that video affects feral druids specifically, can you elaborate on what you were referring to?
---
The private servers have bugs but that has nothing to do with feral DPS being viable or not
---
Honestly best bet is to pick up skinning and first aid, vendor all leather except Thick Leather (similar to wool cloth in that its demand rarely meets supply) and keep first aid up with cloth drops. If you want to level tailoring at end game, send the required cloth to a bank alt until you plan to level it all the way. There are also reputation quest turn ins for cloth that give a significant amount of exp though they may not be in at launch. imo this is the fastest way to level and nets more gold in the process via skins and not spending gold on profession training. An argument can be made for picking up mining/herbing if you want to level their relevant crafting professions later on but chasing nodes all over the map is way more time consuming than you might realize, in a pre-mount world anyways.
---
Missing out.
---
It does hinge on the casuals. Blizzard is a company, and the goal of a company is to make money. They would not be making Classic if they didn't see a chance to make money off of it. Casuals are the *vast* majority of the playerbase, so keeping them from quitting is extremely important. Also, the more successful Classic is in the long term, the more likely it is that Blizzard would be willing to do TBC or even WotLK.
---
Classic is already not 100% Blizzlike (1.12 AV, 1.12 Talents in 1.2, not completely Blizzlike patch or itemization progession, etc) Doing another small something such as the above to improve server health and quality is not out of the question, considering other decisions Blizzhard has already made in regards to Classic. I don't see how it'd be destructive at all - do you see any of those things above as destructive to Classic? World PvP will still be constant, even with WSG and it will allow the rankers to not be in the open world ganking 16+ hours per day.
---
It's like a lose/lose for blizz haha. At least that's how I feel about it. Really isn't a good solution, yet.
---
You listed all the ones off the top of my head. I played a Shaman and one of my best friends played Druid.....I really enjoyed Shaman and watching him play Feral DPS. I think you'll enjoy either one. Both have strong points....do you have a specific goal in mind come 60+? Casual - raid heavy? That might make your choice easier if you have a specific idea of what you want to do.
---
All he says is they shouldn't be in classic. To me that means he thinks they shouldn't be in classic at all.  
---
Honestly if someone presented a solution to the 2 hour queue that isn't xrealm ide happily go for it. Some have said combining imbalanced servers, but that also has issues of its own. It's a real problem, and my hope is that we can come up with a solution as a community, instead of letting Blizzard come up with a solution, which historically doesn't always work so well.
---
Yes, you can run straight to brill and take the air boat to org.
---
At vanilla launch the undead area was painfully overpopulated compared to durotar. The vast majority of horde players choose undead. Even though durotar is shared by orcs and trolls, hardly anyone picks trolls so durotar ends up being better.
---
I feel ya.
---
Why not stick around and make sure your mining is up to the appropriate level?
---
Isn’t that how every single caster is ? And even healers for that matter. People act like vanilla classes had some complex rotation. For the most part every class only has to press they’re 1 main damage dealing ability.  (Ie frost bolt/fireball, shadow bolt) At least as a mele you have to avoid certain mechanics, range literally stands still in the back spamming 1 button for the entire expansion.
---
Congrats on your success! Get rank 14 for me!
---
Those kills are so amazing. Our first Brutallus kill was on a ret paladin bubble taunt.
---
Nope it's 100% humans that have it. Maces and swords.
---
They've incentivized free realm transfers before. Maybe the could do the same for people on the majority faction of a unbalanced server?
---
I don't have any specific goal I want to do ASAP besides hit 60. Then I just want to clear Firelands at least once, maybe not when it's current just whenever. I'm probably going to pvp a lot but I don't think I'll hit a high rank.
---
I have done this via questing in NE zones and plan to do it again. I happen to like the early NE zones a lot though, so that helps. I think the other thing is, how important is getting the saber at 40 vs just the epic? I personally didn't care to much about the regular mount and just got a horse, I viewed it as temporary anyway and made sure I had exalted by 60. That really frees you up to go level wherever, as long as you make sure you run through and do the bulk of the NE quests.
---
I agree, it seems just as boring, if not more, to just sit there and press 1 button as a ranged caster.
---
So maybe crbgs should be handled in a "blizz-like" fashion. Don't have them from the start, and only consider crbgs when imbalance happens or w/e causing high queue times (hopefully doesn't happen). Then later down the road, if it's still bad, implement crbgs in the respective phase (or sooner, but maybe a higher server cap would remedy it).
---
Using voice chat in 2004 is like having a thousand bees in your ear.
---
Sorry, but I disagree. That's the one thing that I'm not looking forward to. It's why I'm going to have blacksmithing as my profession, and i'm just gonna wear armor that only I build for most of my leveling journey. If I come across a great piece that looks fine on my character, then I'll wear it. 
---
Having ugly mismatched armor sucks. For a game that's supposed to be extremely "immersive", the one thing that breaks that immersion is wearing clown armor. I don't have to look like epic mcdoomslayer, but I at least want to look like a warrior.
---
I'd like to go no changes as much as possible, but I can see this causing problems. I like your idea as a compromise. To be nominally closer to no changes, they could just release the level 60 BG, but that might piss people off even more if they get to the point of actually making this "change." What do you think of this early WSG method vs. lowering the amount of honor sub-60's give or just capping at Rank 10 or 11 until Phase 3?
---
SM runs was one of those things as a leveling Alliance that was planned far ahead of time, with more than just randos, you’d want people who could commit for hours.
---
It's not important to get the mount by 40. My concern was that if I take detours to do other zones or quests I like, then I will out-level the NE zones I need to do and lose out on rep. Or were those losses negligible in your experience?
---

---
&gt; I don’t think it is a reasonable use of my time to farm a specific drop or money
---
This is hands down the weirdest comment I have seen on this subreddit and I have seen some weird shit.
---
Yeah idk. Hopefully blizz has their top minds working on this issue, because it's actually probably one of the bigger ones in regards to vanillas success and long term health.
---
Wouldn't playing on a PvE realm fix this?
---

Dwarves get +Gun. Humans get +Mace, +Sword. Orc get +Axe.

So no, no +Mace for superior dwarves. But stoneform removes bleeds and it's pretty dope.

---
This is going to come down to which class fantasy you like more. They're pretty even on paper. I rolled a druid as my alt in vanilla and I think that class worked better for me for my first time through. I'm going to do a shaman alt this time around, though. Because it's basically a coin flip.
---
It’s pretty well established that being defense capped isn’t necessary
---
Yeah it could, but PvP servers are always the most populated so casuals on those realms will still not be having a great time.
---
Please reply with another douchey comment so you can continue to get downvoted.
---
The reason literally 100% of the time is “I played ret in vanilla and I want to relive that experience.” Ret players aren’t the most creative bunch.
---
Pretty much. For leveling it will probably be fine and you can heal the lower level dungeons as Ret anyway. You'll have issues at max level with dungeon and raid PUGs though. If you're really dedicated you can raid as Ret with a casual/semi hardcore guild. It does take a lot of prep work for every raid night though. You need to farm more consumables compared to other dps classes to be viable as a Ret Paladin.
---
I think my guild will bring one Ret Paladin to a raid but the rest will be healing. The good thing about Paladin's is that you only really need 20 points in the Holy tree to heal in dungeons and raids so you can always go 31 Ret and 20 Holy. I'm going 22 Holy, 11 Prot and 18 Ret and plan to heal in raids and heal/dps in pvp.
---
I don't think lowering honor would do anything, since ranking is all based on brackets. Bracket 1 could be 100k honor or 1 million honor, either way it all rewards the same amount of RP still and is based on how many people are currently active in PvP (25+ hk's that week if I'm not mistaken) - capping ranks *could* help, but those people still need to maintain that rank going into Phase 3, which at the end of the day won't reduce the amount of World PvP going on more than likely.
---
Hunters are the only class with a real rotation.
---
Even speaking as a rogue main, Judgement is the best in vanilla, still a contender for best in the game.
---
June 26th
---
Tell me he had cables?
---
&gt; the top players running around ruthlessly farming everyone day in and out for honor
---
I disagree with this. There are first of all no "top players" in vanilla. Your only metric so far was no-lifing.
---
Also this talk about having "vastly" better gear is overblown. MC raiding gear is not "vastly" better for PvP than a mix of crafted stuff and dungeon blues. We're talking about a few points more DPS and a bit more stamina (if at all) etc.
---
Yes there will be people who get ganked by groups. But it is just on the players to group themselves and stop taking save passage for granted. Vanilla is just not tailored to people who solo grind all the time and mind their own buisness.
---
&gt; camping every single 50+ zone for honor 16+ hours a day
---
Such a tiny little fraction of the player base is even able to attempt that. And even a tinyer fraction of that is skilled and organized enough to stand their ground against other groups. Private servers are *full* of players who are not interested in PvP at all, so they get "farmed". They just play on PvP servers because there aren't enough PvE options which high population. But I doubt this will be the case in classic. I expect players to be much more active on wPvP, especially in phase 2, so these attempts in "farming" wPvP honor will just lead to back and forth skirmishes.
---
From my experience there are plenty of people who play or played WoW casually and are miles better at PvP than others who achieved high PvP ranks. Because you don't lose honor when you die or lose. You can fail most engagements you take on, but still come out ahead in the PvP reward system because you played more than other people.
---
[September 23] (https://www.drikpanchang.com/seasons/season-autumnal-equinox-timings.html?year=2019) this year, actually - albeit barely.
---
I keep "joking" Blizz plans to launch Classic at 1:49 AM (mountain time) on the 23rd. This will give them a full 26 seconds of wiggle room/plausible deniability.
---
...it wasn't a funny joke when I started telling it and it only gets worse with every repetition, but pretending to laugh is the only way I can open my mouth without screaming.
---
Name your unborn child, "Thrall" regardless of gender. 
---
I plan on walking out on my family once Classic WoW drops
---
I like the hybrid play style in pvp personally so I still heal a lot. But reckoning bombs and wind furry procs are hilariously fun in pvp. Nothing better than one shotting people at full HP.
---
&gt; All I did was running around in beta with 40 people tagging shit and killing rares
---
Hah, you found 39 people who were willing to run around with you, but were giving you ALL of the loot?
---
Once a quest goes gray, I believe you lose 20% rep each level after that, so it behooves you to complete those Darnassus quests at the appropriate level. If you plan it out properly, and minimize experience from non-quest mobs, you can actually complete most faction quests in each zone before they go gray. That way you can quest through the other zones in addition to the NE zones. And if spillover rep works the way it should, you’ll also get 25% Darnassus rep from all of those other city faction quests.
---
I’m currently working on a quest completionist guide for that very purpose:
---

---
+ good hotkeys
---
Fair enough. If there's 0 honor for killing someone under 60, though, it would at least limit the number of FPs worth camping, right? And if it's capped at rank 11, you wouldn't need to be higher than bracket 4 to fight decay. Idk, I'm just spitballing about this. Interesting conversation to have, though.
---
Nagas.
---
I just wanna play Vanilla.
---
I distinctly remember killing humanoids trying to get those stupid cloth shoulders even as a warrior! Great times
---
You do bring up valid points, but I feel 0 honor for an HK for a level 60 vs a level 48-59 is more 'unblizzlike' than just adding WSG into Phase 2. Rank 11 cap makes more sense imo.
---
Thought fourth as my lol well

There’s a trinket that increases imp dps. Full fire lock with imp is legit.
---
&gt; I keep seeing vanilla and classic WoW wikis mention that Dwarves have +5 added to their mace skill,
---
Where have you seen that?
---
I'm pretty sure I remember seeing anal [item] spam during vanilla.
---
Of course there are top players, there are top players in every game ever made. Some are bad, most are average, some are very good, and the rest fall inbetween those 3. 
---
Early Molten Core gear (and weapons) are definitely much stronger in PvP, considering most of your pre-BiS dungeon blues lack stamina. Of course there are other off-pieces to use, but having MC gear does give you a huge advantage, especially the weapons. Even if those players bring another 3-4 to fight the 3 man gank squad, they'll likely still lose to more experienced players.
---
Just because a small fraction of the playerbase will camp 16+ hours/day, all it takes is 1 Guild of people doing that to make most 50+ zones unplayable and there will be multiple EU and a few NA Guilds like this. I agree there are plenty of bad R14's, but those are not the players I'm talking about. They'll rank too, albeit slower than the rest.
---
Fukken saved. Thank you.
---
Alot of people say this, that the mechanics are easy and the game is old etc etc.. Yet on private servers you can see good/decent guilds wipe with full world buffs
---
Great work, that's a really thorough guide! I'm definitely going to keep that on my radar, thanks.
---
This is fantastic! Please do more =D
---
I played a shaman to 85. If I were to do it again I would definitely try Druid. 
---
So many options and directions you can go. But that’s just my personal opinion.
---
Yeah, wasn't a problem for me, but I very rarely just grind, quest as much as I can. And like the other guy said  don't do grey quests, it's not worth it.
---
Remember you get some darnassus rep for quests with alliance rep and as human you have 10% rep racial also. 
---
I think the really important part is the early game. Do all of teldrassill instead of ellwyn, the quest density and amount of rep there is insane. In my experience you can do all of both darkshore and westfall without hitting grey quests in either. Then similarly you can do all of ashenvale and redrigdge.
---
Then go wherever for a while but eventually end up in desplace and then later feralas. Should be good.
---
How old are you? You sound fucking toxic right now
---
I bought a Switch back in January, so I've played Let's Go Pikachu very casually the last few months. Gonna pick up Final Fantasy X on the 16th and play that until Classic comes out.
---
Just gonna break up with my gf and quit my job tbf
---
Defcamp and Melderon.
---
I enjoyed ret for that small chance of a double crit of your melee and soc proc. Anyway the rotation is starting off fight judging crusader&gt;having soc up&gt; judgement on cd&gt;consecrate if specced, that's it. Also ret is pretty underrated for pvp. You can hold your own vs a lot of classes 1v1
---
Yeah we have a Facebook group with about 500 people in it from back then, and remember him posting about it. I don't remember him being in WE though
---
Settin up shop here. Got no worthwhile input but glad to be here, folks!
---
You will compete with EVERYONE for gear as a shaman except warriors. 
---
Caster cloth,  good weapons, ideally a set for solo, healing, regardless of your actual spec. 
---
That being said shaman in classic is a super fun hybrid, and a really solid healer in pve. 
---
Druids smell like bear farts.
---
Not really just used barrens chat  and join rare kill group.  Was about 2hours of fun
---
Yeah, you're probably right on that one. Though if we only have a Rank 11 cap, that would still mean 4 weeks of pushing bracket 1 or 2 to reach the cap, which might make the whole thing moot if Phase 2 is going to be short.
---
If they hit it, great, those who found the theory and believed in it are rewarded.
---
If they don't hit it, great, those who found the theory were wrong and Blizzard don't have to admit to anything.
---
Had a similar experience but on my guild's first Karazhan clear in TBC. We were all but wiped and Malchazar died from a tick of Corruption.
---
I'll play the game as long as it's vanilla and then go back on to private servers if it no longer satisfies me. 
---
Sure it might go to hell, that'd be unfortunate, but I'm not gonna sit here and be a (miss)fortune teller and say that it will.
---
paying the same amount we did for a 15 year old game is really... but hey, at least it's a good game
---
So funny thinking back to how much I hated Tarnov and the aftermath of everything that happened. In a couple first kill videos you can hear her in vent like moaning to druid gear dropping. We had a silent bid system and Tarnov was rigging it for her

What a strange world we live in now. I love it.
---
Can you do ubrs quests while in a 10man raid group?
---
Even if it’s not necessary, you should be able to equip items to get def capped. It’s not even possible to get def capped in Phase 1 without several greens, you should still carry those greens to the raid.
---
This project isn't for profit for to get people to play, it's to recreate what Vanilla was in the most accurate way possible for people to see. I'm so glad they're not ruining it by adding in battlegrounds too early.
---
Guess it depends on what you define as rare, it could be relative.
---
There were only a handful of epics that dropped from dungeons, a small amount of world epics, Epic PvP gear was reserved for the top percentages.
---
40man raids had only a few drops per boss.
---
To me, seeing purple was a lot more impressive in Vanilla than in, for example, WotLK.
---
I don't know? I didn't suggest he not do that. I was only asking what he'd do in that situation.
---
You vote with your wallet. Even if the shareholders don't know what proportion of the revenue is coming from Classic the people within Blizzard will. I want to play Classic and when I pay to do so they will see that the current game is getting zero played time from me.
---
Yeah for sure, that should be how people are rewarded.. Not just randomly by RNG titanforges etc :) 
---
Also, it's not like 2-3 skilled players can't kill a rank14 geared player...
---
Did you recently change weapons? If not, it’s likely just a confirmation bias.
---
I don't have a recording. Whooping you guys' asses was no big deal. But let's see your video or were you lying about it.
---
Retail has no weight in whether or not I play Classic.  
---
If Classic has any video game competition for me right now, it's probably against a ton of PC RPG/Simulation games I wasn't able to play until I recently built a new computer. Retail isn't even apart of the calculation.
---
Shaman have Bloodlust, which gets you into raids. Probably fewer overall Druids will be around. Theres really no wrong way to go, and it doesnt matter till youre post-60 anyway. 
---
Shaman are a ranged/melee/healing hybrid while druids can really do those 3 plus tank, but more Tank/healer. Just depends what you want to do.
---
Stay away from RP-PvP. I've heard the things you guys say in teamspeak. You guys belong on PvP servers.
---
Thanks I didn't know that for the gear. I forgot that this was classic and you have basically have to take what you can get when it comes to gear.
---
Hell, 1 skilled person can take down a rank 14 player. It’s not some instant kill armour like some make it out to be.
---
Nice, exact same thing with me. I tanked all of BWL clicking, but PVP set me straight
---
1. NE rep grind:
---
You can start this somewhat late and still get most of the way something like level 12 fits well, and then when you hit lvl20 it stops being an issue because of teleport(and keeping your hearth in whatever questzone). Will it mess with other stuff? Well obviously you can't do all the early questlines without getting too much exp. But most people do end up leveling alts eventually and you can experience those qlines then.
---
2. This is available from launch. Back in vanilla I believe they buffed the rep gain around 1.10, but I think the buffed version will probably be standard in classic. From what I hear it's about the same work 1-60 quickly. As a mage you don't really need to do that many dungeons for gear, and you do need gold for most of the gear, which means you could do this as a very poor money maker, but well granted you will farm it a lot so eventually gold will come your way. Also the tiger is way way cooler than any NE ones.
---
3. It's pretty expensive and yes I believe you will have to wait until phase2.
---
If I'm Blizzard, I want Classic players to move over to Retail because I can make more money off of them there (buying expansions, cash shop, etc).
---
I won't have any time off and currently have a two week old and a four year old.
---
I'm not gonna have much time to play :(
---
Thanks, sounds like this is what I'll probably end up doing then.
---
unless u really go a lot out of ur way to gather tons of ore/herb/cloth all the time ur not gonna have enough to keep up with your level
---
so u either spend ur little gold on the AH to keep your crafting profession relevant to your level, or u just ignore it till 60 and buy it when it's not your whole wallet
---
Just depends on how you play Jesus you min/maxers can you not think for your self?! Shame shame
---
I don't get it? is this a casual thing for people who work?
---
I'm not trying to gatekeep or anything but if you don't have a shit bucket and still have a job then you shouldn't be playing.
---
It depends some on which profession you mean. But for just about all of them you'll hit a skill level where the only way to skill up is to make things at a loss over and over. Recipes that cost more in mats than the final product is worth, or that generally don't sell at all. 
---
Once you're max level then you can profit by only making what you need or can sell
---
&gt; it's to recreate what Vanilla was in the most accurate way possible for people to see.
---
You are forgetting that the no BG but have honor system only lasted for SEVEN weeks. To dedicate an entire phase of world camping because of 7 weeks before blizzard could push out BG's is a joke.
---
Rogue or mage
---
Warrior and rogue.
---
Topping meters isnt very important since threat exists
---
Oh, so doing a lot of damage is kinda pointless? That’s interesting
---
Weapons are only at rank 14 which takes months to do. We will not see a rank 14 at BWL launch. We will not see a rank 14 after until well after BWL is cleared.
---
I think mage would be easier without being very geared? Or are rogues about equal with gear dependance?
---
The problem is that most of the stuff you craft is useless vendor junk and you are basically turning materials into skill ups, expensive materials that either you find yourself(which in turn could've been AH'd for more money than what you gain out of it), or buy it. Either way you are essentially paying money to get those skill ups.
---
I see it at phase 4. There is only WSG and AV at phase 3.
---
As someone who is married and has a 1 year old
---
baby. I am pretty much straight up with my wife about how much Classic WoW means to me and my plans. I am planning on taking time off from work to grind it out to 60. 
---
After that is done, it should be easier to exercise balance by playing at night. I instinctively want to no life the game, but I have to step back, think, and balance both sides. Won’t be easy, but it is worth it. Classic WoW is the pinnacle of the gaming experience!
---
Well according to 90% of people I've seen on forums and on here, they're going to grind R14 and then become Scarab Lords.
---
You have to learn the recipes. Few Silver adds up to a few G at lvl 40 and so on. You cant really sell much of anything though. Only very few select items can make a profit because the mats generally are worth more than the items.
---
Bloodlust was not introduced until TBC

Pretty much quest givers (NPC only) will give DKs. Getting a DK is a death sentence in terms of ranking.
---
It's not pointless, it's just that managing your threat is more important than doing to maximum amount of damage possible. You doing 800 dps instead of 700 isn't really going to make a huge difference when it comes to killing a boss, but you pulling aggro away from the tank sure will.
---
It is 100% for profit. Blizzard is a massive corporation run by Activision. They don't do *anything* if there isn't some sort of profit in it. Also what Craghack said below is spot on.
---
Okay, so without pulling aggro, what DPS does the most damage?
---
True. It's a hard call honestly.
---
I'll take one scarab lord and a side of rank 14 too, thanks.
---
It’s not pointless, but someone, like a warlock for example could hypothetically top the meters, but they have a super high aggro threshold. So they end up not casting to manage their threat. Lowering their dps. It’s a balance.
---
Cool story brah. Would read again.
---
Its either that or they have no life and the tedious time consuming grinding is an advantage for them.
---
They release classic at the same time as 8.2 to look back at the investors and say....”Told ya 8.2 would bring more subs” wink wink
---
It's cool to be edgy now, but just makes them look super nasty.
---
My vacation schedule is done a year in advance.  I can’t take off anyways.  I could get ”sick” however.
---
Fury War, Mage, Rogue
---
Priest are the best for PvP but require peels. Without peels, you will get murdered.
---
These guys are retarded. Just roll a rogue and vanish after some threat. Boom no more threat issues.
---
Jokes on you my retail characters all look stupid as shit! I opt for the most stupid armor combinations in transmog
---
I would take a good priest over a good holy paladin any day of the week for the rank grind. 
---
Without offensive dispels, alliance premades will lose against horde premades.
---
That is why the ideal composition for competitive WSG is 2 priests and 1 paladin for alliance.
---
I can see Xrealm being a good thing later in the expansion where the diehard pvp rankers has quiet down and people already know the players on the server. So something like phase 5 like how it was done back in retail vanilla.
---
I am very capable of thinking of myself, just looking to collaborate with others. One of my favorite parts of the game is min/maxing while enjoying everything there is to offer. It would be great if you actually had something to contribute like these other lovely individuals! If not, don't comment...it is that simple, friend. Everyone enjoys different aspects about the game.
---
Quit whining and be grateful we have phases
---
Crafting your own gear has the same cost as buying it. If you use materials to craft something, that means you can't sell those materials on the AH.
---
Awesome. The first time my guild killed Maexxna, a priest shadow word pain finished him off while the entire raid including that priest died
---
Also, you can have fun on a warrior solo if you level your profs as you go.  Cooking in particular.  It was HIGHLY immersive and enjoyable while I messed around on a ******* server.
---
Still died, but it felt like I was using everything the game had to offer.  As opposed to a self healing class or a mage with their conjured food.
---
From what I hear Warriors and Rouges, then mages. However they can all trade back and forth in a fight based on boss mechanics and resistances, there's also buffs from other classes like Windfury, Grace of Air, Blessings, ect. But in a vacuum played perfectly Warriors do the most followed by rouge then, mage, at least that's what I'm told.
---
That's probably part of it too. In vanilla, gear matters much more than proficiency.
---
Especially in PvP with short ttks and lack of defensive/selfhealing
---
so, go to westfall as a gnome?
---
but what if we wipe and vanish will be on cd cant have that
---
1. Warrior.
---
2. Rogue.
---
He accidentally switched to humanoid form?
---
That's a super long winded way of saying the same thing
---
Why not download an add-on and then you're happy without forcing me to deal with your QoL?
---
Group-finder? LoL at having to run thru BRD to get to Molten Core. Getting all 5 people to Scholo...
---
How easily we forget.
---
I was leveling a horde character just so I could transfer stuff through the neutral AH and got *3* recipes by the time I was in my early 20s 
---
Quite valuable once I got them to the alliance AH
---
Jobs are for poor people
---
You think you are asking a simple question and people make it so complicated. 
---
I played a hunter in TBC and when my threat for high id feign death, lol.
---
damn, good point. If folks re-sub for both 8.2 and classic bliz would be 'Scrooge McDuck swimming in gold' level rich. Easily Million+ subs.
---
I think you fed your Bear-form Druid too many Rage potions. :V
---
As a ret paladin the focus was still on defensive action rather than offensive. It was defense utility first and offense second. The former was awesome and the latter was a passive thing there for you to, eventually, win your fights. Still think I picked the right class.
---
Also for what it's worth -- the pictured meme literally never happened to me. You can be whatever in dungeons they're not that hard and no one seemed to care, at least back then.
---
Yeah I realized that, mostly just wanted to extrapolate on your point a little. The bit at the end about chasing nodes around is definitely relevant to your leveling speed but of course, it's a matter of opinion and priority
---
I don't even remember how much I clicked. I know I was a keyboard turner for quite a while though, so assume I clicked everything. But at least by the end of vanilla and early BC I used keybinds. Think someone just told me it was better, so I did it, was never stubborn about it, just ignorant.
---
If I'm hitting every node that I encounter while I'm questing, than am I going to be able to keep up with my level?
---
I don't know what you mean by 'viable'.
---
Can it be played? Sure, everything can be played. Did you mean it by that? 
---
Or did you mean "you gotta prep a ton to be on even footing with other DPS classes who don't need to prep and can generate the same if not more DPS then you"
---
That source of yours uses ignites and it's pretty much wrong.
---
The individual mage damage might be SLIGHTLY higher and by that I mean something like a maximum of 5 %.
---
I really hope that we'll get addons like an updated version of recount exclusively for vanilla, that distributes all ignites correctly to each mage and it won't matter what you roll anyway. From what I've seen it's pretty much being Warriors, Mages, Locks and Rogues on top.
---
I would choose armor. I'm tank, I want to mitigate damage.
---
I’m excited to play ret, but I’m more excited to not feel the group rejection by rolling a hybrid holy/prot spec.
---
Were you playing on Gorgonnash or Blackrock by any chance? Can't remember which but I remember seeing that guild around a fair bit when I was levelling.
---
My biggest concern.
---
Also note that it's not soul bound. You can use it and then pass to your son.
---
You best learn to heal too son
---
Don't go into classic thinking "I'm going to play a ret pally". That's not how the game works.
---
Go into it thinking "I'm going to play a paladin," and gear for/spec ret when it suits your goals in the game. That might mean raiding as holy to get ret gear for pvp. That's just how vanilla works. There isn't a single class whose optimal raid spec is also the optimal pvp spec (or even the optimal 5-man spec).
---
Hey I really appreciate this comment. After posting in this thread I decided to make [my own post](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbnehp/how_hard_is_it_to_gear_a_pvp_ele_shaman/) and what you said summarizes that entire post perfectly. I’ll definitely be rolling a shaman come classic!
---
Mining and blacksmithing. Once I hit 60, I'm going to have to level up the profession anyways. Won't the same cost/grind be associated with it with I'm sixty? I feel like it will be worse because I'll have to halt end-game content just to grind out all the levels, vs the steady pace of leveling my profession as I quest.
---
Lmao I do that sometimes too just to troll :P
---
I don't know how it will be this time around, but the pictured meme literally never happened to me as a ret Paladin.
---
But how many achievement points will I get?
---
You're not wrong.
---
But if another DPS shows up, that ret will be kicked.
---
I'm out of the loop on the census, so pardon if this is already the case - but please be sure to include "what server type do you plan on plan on rolling on" as one of the questions, and please include RP-PvP server type listed as well, since it is not absolutely out of the question that it would be an offered server type and could provide valuable data about genuine interest across the four server types.
---
That's awesome. But the new WoW Classic will run on a 7.0 (Legion) client as it has new graphics and menus. So you can store your CDs away.
---
NOT EVEN CLOSE!
---
As far as I’m concerned, retail died with the shattering of Azeroth and the introduction of LFR
---
Dude why do u bother posting an opinion on a game you never played?
---
I never clicked, but one day I switched from WASD to ESDF and bound my mouse's thumb and middle buttons to Shift/Ctrl/Alt.  And suddenly I had binds for every spell, trinket, potion, gear set... It took a while to learn but being able to immediately handle any situation felt amazing.
---
This is sick. Reminds me so much of the webcomics that were current around vanilla/early TBC. Bring it back!
---
From a perspective of enjoying the leveling experience and not rushing end game, I think it is totally worth going for all the items you want to get.
---
But such sweet whispers.
---
Careful, some of us are programmers, and if we supervise a autohotkey bot that we wrote while at work, that's not botting, right?
---
If you have it cool, if not it doesn’t matter. Removing your ability to be crit isn’t nearly as valuable as people once thought it was. There are so few bosses who actually “need” you to be defense capped. Such as BL, chrom, patch &amp; even these don’t require it. 
---
When attempting to max out in defensive gear it oftentimes come at the cost of other stats, which lower threat and give you a reduced health pool. You stifle your raids dps when you can’t generate enough threat. Likewise if you have a decent raid of healers you being crit shouldn’t be a cause to concern. Actually if you are required to be defense capped to survive any encounters in MC then you have an issue with bad healers, not your tanks stats. Given he’s geared appropriately otherwise. 
---
Defensive is a valuable stat,  but you in no way need to be troubling yourself to get just enough defense to reach 440. There are better items without defense or lower defense and far better stats worth taking. One point of defense gives you .12 dodge, parry, &amp; chance to be missed. There are other forms of mitigation, defense cap is no longer the end all be all. Especially for experienced raids.
---
What are some of the bindings?
---
You were not playing well.
---
There isn't even a confirmation of fury tanking. Yes you can tank in fury spec, but a lot of the info that private servers run off of is wrong. You cant sit to get crit strikes proc, the armor values/mitigation isnt correct. Yes you can fury tank but the value isn't known yet if it will really be that great or just slightly better for threat and the trade off of defense. Players like skarm will always adapt to what meta is the fastest clearing but I wouldn't plan to fury tank just yet, the most popular one will prob be impale tanking. 
---
On a side note I would just play what I want if u wanna ele shaman then play ele. You just won't be in a hardcore raiding guild. It's not confirmed 8 slot debuffs yet. If it starts with 16 spriest will be viable from the start and warlocks will be pumping more dmg in mc. Just need to wait for news about it.
---
That are pokers. On. Fire. But still daggers...  but also pokers....
---
On fire.
---
probably definitely not unless u also get ahead of the curve to be like the only person in an area who can gather the stuff, or when the server starts to die
---
plus lots of people go herb/mining + skinning while lvling just to sell and make some extra cash
---
I can def see where you’re coming from. It does suck if you’re stuck with ugly ass gear in the later levels. But at the same time it’s pretty cool that’s it’s leading you to blacksmith and make armor for yourself. That’s what RPGs are all about
---
Why do you enjoy a Ret pally ? Like waiting for ya swing and one damage move? Actually curious.
---
You tend to be poor when your leveling. Having to buy mounts and skills. The possible gold per hour you can farm at 60 is far greater. So even though it costs the same it's a much lower amount compared to your income. Also it doesn't take a ton of time if you power level at 60. 
---
There isn't anything wrong with doing it while you level of your going to take your time anyway. Mining would be fine and just save the mats as you go. But anticipate waiting longer for your mount and sometimes having to farm for abilities and repairs
---
Honestly, it's hard to say. As someone who played back in vanilla, and even played in the beta (4 friends, one got in the closed beta, we had a rotation of play xD) you just see the savory delight recipe and know that everyone wants to be a pirate/ninja. As far as other recipes? Either hold on to it if it isn't listed or sell if there are others posted to show you the price you should ask. Never vendor white or higher items unless you know their AH value.
---
You win 🤗
---
Z, q, s, e, r, t, etc
---
I have a long fingers so its uncomfortable for me to hit shift and a number key like others do.
---
I agree
---
I got you fam. Check your dms. The server I'm giving you is used by legit some of the best classic pvpers. Very friendly/helpful atmosphere. Lots of people wanting to just get better.
---
So how did you convince randoms in barrens to give you all the loot? Or did everyone in the 40 man raid group also gain 20g in 2 hours?
---
How do you feel about paying $1200 to have a chinese guy do it?
---
Because even with a middling $10 and hour job, and not including overtime you would would make almost $13,000 in that same time you spent grinding WSG.
---
Ethical or not - I think the vast majority of HWL / GM will be store bought, just because it is overwhelmingly more practical to do so.

Man, you're doing it all wrong.
---
Don't turn a heater on and wear a blanket: overclock!
---
💜
---
Thanks. It sounds like I have decide between crafting my own gear (and avoiding the tragedy of having mismatched armor), and having a mount. And seeing as how I decided my race based on how cool the racial mount is, then I'm going to go with having the mount.
---
Can you recommend a profession for quick gold?
---
He’s a demon in Winterspring you have to kill for the epic hunter bow and staff.
---
I don’t know how to say this.  A roaming gank squad...has killed every player in the Arathi Highlands.  We needs the sword of a thousand truths, commonly abbreviated wsg.  
---
10/10 OP.
---
join our discord, i gotchu fam
---
Hmm interesting. My guild does YOLO runs in AQ the way most guilds Yolo BWL. 
---
- Having all warlocks lifetap to lowest possible health 
---
- Have everyone in raid equip Goblin Rocket Boots
---
- Have have a pull timer 
---
- 1 druid Regrowths all warlocks, then we all run to the to the boss room, (Chromaggus room in BWL, Ouro Aq40)
---
- The druid gets healing aggro from all the mobs, and runs the opposite way.
---
- Druid dies, mobs come kill us. SS priests or shaman rez up etc.
---
Yes, it's the bag as an easy winner. I got an entire level killing those oozes. And they didn't even drop loot back then
---
Show them by not buying the newest expansions when they come out.
---
I'd say healer, personally I'd never even consider pugging a tank for raids.
---
The aesthetic, the challenge, the pride in getting people to eat their words with sheer effort. Slaying the unwashed masses of the Horde, with the pure, unadulterated might of the Holy Light.
---
Judgement Armor
---
While leveling, mining and skinning. Mining since you'll be using it and skinning is just extra gold.
---
Everyone is replaceable.
---
Generic Raidleader voice: Only one bag of soul shards!?! That's a f-ing 50 DKP minus!
---
:D
---
Raided from China in multiple expansions. Get a higher tier ISP like China Telecom and look into a tunneling service like Battleping. Also, consider play time. Late at night early AM you'll have less packet loss.
---
that made it so much more epic - it was a whole adventure
---
I remember shitting my pants as soon as we entered Horde territory... you felt a very tangible sense of danger
---
This is very useful gj
---
It’s not that bad. One of my favorite zones of vanilla. You never feel alone because you always see people walking everywhere, especially at the crossroads. Can’t wait to relive it
---
Actuality, changing forms reset rage.
---
Really made having that T2 Dragonstalker fantastic... until Outland came along.
---
Share please :)
---
Depends on what level your DK is when you complete them

---
I strafe with a and d and move with mouse, thats the best advice I can give you
---
Honestly unless I’m running a baron run I’d invite rets all day.
---
Mighty trolls blood potions are actually a pretty good moneymaker the mats are basically free and the pots sell ok on a good day
---
I take it you dont have a very important job.
---
Well, have a nap.
---
Honestly, They are probably over recruiting just due to the fact that you need 40 lvl 60 players and there is no telling how long it will take most people to get to 60. Some of those other warlocks could take 3 months. Honestly, no matter what roll you play, you will still need to either out effort or out preform others(especially if you have goals to get Atiesh).
---
That's very true. Though I'm still fairly sure that they will drop a massive bomb that will sell classic servers as filler content for retail players
---
What am I talking about? Well the wardrobe, pet, mount, title, achievement system. Just because those features are disabled on classic it doesn't mean that they don't exist. I wouldn't be surprised to see an announcement: Hey btw you can farm those - no longer available skins etc... - just log into a classic server and start digging. Everything you get there will be unlocked for retail
---
All of a sudden you've assured that the entire non raid non pvp audience of retail is considering classic as content for themselves.
---
Lol it’s funny you posted this I was just talking to my friends a week or so ago about this guy and that we get to fight him again in classic xD
---
Would not suggest it, I too mained feral from BC on, but Vanilla is just not going to cut it.
---
Would be happy with a bear however, and think it's fine if you DPS'd when not needed to tank.
---
But a DPS main? I don't think so .... annoying gearing, annoying power shifting rotation, unable to use engineering, expected to farm gnomer if you are to be competitive, unable to benefit from the best enchants .... it's a huge uphill struggle to be at best mediocre.
---
So play a PVE server if you can't handle it.
---
I can't wait and am pretty happy to see this. My only concern is with no dishonorable kills people will camp quest givers. But I don't care that much this is how Classic actually was.
---
It does sorta suck that if someone is in a full tier set, they're gonna be ridiculed for going for the awesome as hell tier set instead of BiS. :-/
---
Truly art
---
It's not a flaw, it's a feature mate.
---
Phase 3 is WSG/AV and BWL/Darkmoon Fair which were also released in patch 1.6.0
---
jajajajaja
---
Just one of those things. The allure of a PvP server is the ability to kill the opposite faction but it gives people the power to abuse the system (just like you mention). You have to choose what you would rather when picking PvP or PvE server.   
---
I don't think they should change anything.
---
Yea, i would. I would rather play PvP, but if there's nothing stopping a handful of trolls from making the game unplayable for huge set of people then probably not.
---
There needs to be some negative in-game consequence to killing someone 40 levels lower than you, otherwise it's ripe for abuse and a broken game mode.
---
You made all those maps? Why haven’t you made a thread about it yet? Those are really cool. Looks like a lot of work went into them too.
---
But if I do that how will I gain a slight lead against you?!?
---
But kidding aside. Maybe I'll complite everything I got, but I save so much, often times the info is repeated. I don't know that my collection is all that helpful.
---
I always picked up Lightning Reflexes, Deflection, and Riposte when leveling rogues. My logic was time saved by not eating was just as good as time saved by doing more damage. Then again I've never set any speed leveling records so don't take my word for it.
---
I love it! Very well done! 😁
---
Last summer, I was suffering from very bad anxiety. The thing that let me fall asleep at night was the debate between what my main would be, and just the hype of it all really helped clear my mind during the roughest parts of it.
---
Blizzard has no clue what they are actually doing for their community, but it truly is powerful stuff.
---
They've already confirmed that they will never do that.
---
Mine was 1 warrior left execute spamming on Arthas-US
---
Important yes, but also replacable. I guess it depends what sort of organisation you work for. I work for a very large organisation where there are a lot of applicants for each vacancy.
---
They made another appearance in Wotlk in the DK starter zone too - you use 2 of them and run around the city stabbing/torturing people for information.
---
It’s pretty jarring to see these old screenshots comparing to how the game looks on private servers with modern PCs. We never really knew what we were missing back then and that the game could look much better
---
Well I have a particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career.
---
They’ll want to spread content from 8.2 retail patch (which is supposed to be significant and impactful in game) and Classic. I am still in August camp. Tail end of summer, ladies and gents!
---
Nope, theres a special server just for you so you dont have to deal with these problems.
---
This looks a lot better than vanillaguide, which is clearly meant for hunters as it mentions utilising the pet quite a lot.
---
Also it sends you to areas with densely packed orange mobs, all right for a hunter, but impossible for a warrior
---
There is no abuse here. That is the way it is supposed to be. If you don't care for it; don't play it.
---
Healer is amazing for pugging. Tank is very bad.
---
Do not roll a tank if you're going to be raiding casually or inconsistently imo. Tanking requires a lot of player investment (or at least player knowledge), and as a tank you'll probably be expected to meet a schedule since each raid has only a couple tanks and they're really the "heart" of the group.
---
For this reason, healer gives you a lot more flexibility. However, I'd add that unlike retail WoW- many of the DPS classes are quite in demand as well, and rolling a Mage or a Warlock will make it pretty easy to get into most raids (obviously this may shift at launch, but that's being general about it).
---
Of course, play what you want. I find that in these months leading up to release, people have been saying "oh yeah, *good luck getting a raid slot with that*" to like.. 85% of specs, and I just don't know if it'll be that strict when push comes to shove.
---
There are ways to maintain that allure and still punish the people abusing the system. For instance they already have the concept of Dishonorable kills in vanilla if you kill civilian NPCs - a small change would be to also apply that concept to people that kill say more 5 low level players in x period of time.
---
This is war peacock.  
---
It was veruly common in vietnam.
---
When you see a kid running you pop em in the back of the head.  Kids squeal, and theyll give away your position.
---
Link?
---
And a thunderfury for dps warrior
---
If you were on a pve server you wouldnt sound like such a bitch. You would just be one.
---
Man up or play pve. I honestly didnt know the game was called world of pussy craft
---
This is literally discussed daily
---
Part of the honor of pvp realms is finally making it to max level after having been ganked so many times..and them you go ganking.
---
 [https://wowclassicpriest.wordpress.com/](https://wowclassicpriest.wordpress.com/)
---
Ret pallies are just fine in dungeons. They just won't be allowed in any hardcore raid groups.
---
So find a casual raid group and you'll be fine.
---
Nah sorry pal. Doesn't work that way.
---
Need a simple benediction / anathema staff :)
---
They're pretty close, it really comes down to which you feel like you'll enjoy more. I think most people tend to like Shaman more- but you do you.
---
Remember, vanilla WoW is.. different. Builds aren't as clear cut as the "pick one out of three" system that retail WoW has, So I think some of the "greater variety" that Druid appears to have can be a little superficial, especially considering Balance Druids are essentially a non-starter in vanilla outside of a few PvP uses.
---
I still click, but it's a habit I'm starting to break thanks to League of Legends. I mastered the very little amount of "keybinds" that are in that game and really saw the value of keybinds after that. I haven't actually played WoW since MoP and I'm excited to keybind!
---
Those are the best kills, straight up back from the grave.
---
Server type will be included!
---
because they've never gone back on their words when there was a chance to make money with it.
---
Don't expect it to happen at the start of the classic project. Expect it more at the end of the cycle when people start to drop out when they know that they've reached the peak. 
---
That is obviously only if the classic project is not a big success (which we can't really predict) because if it is they max decide to extend the project beyond classic to BC or even Wotlk. But all that depends on how the upcoming years pan out
---
This guy is on to something, keep going
---
You are not describing a bottleneck. What you're describing COULD be a bottleneck, if there was something about it slowing people down. Without the slowdown, it's not a bottleneck.
---
Threat is a non issue in classic now.
---
All of us warriors have tps gear/consumes and we threat race faster than the most geared in the group
---
Tanks prioritize threat over def cap nowadays
---
I have to plans for "duo leveling" with my friend when classic drops, but he smokes as much weed as I do without having a job so hell probably end up running me through razorfen before I'm out of the Barrens
---
Do you enjoy doing the same quest for 2 hours because some troll is singlehandedly killing your 5 man party in 6 seconds flat, and then repeating it until you give up on the quest?  At level 20 you need to gather probably more than 50 of your peers to kill a lvl 60 - if there's more than one you can forget about it. Does that sound like the way it's supposed to be?
---
Really anything is fine. I think people are over-hyping how competitive and "hardcore" Classic WoW will be, because this sub is generally more 'hardcore' players. 
---
Basically, it's less of a question of what classes you should roll and which you shoulden't. The only ones that I think would really be a hassle for a casual player is like.. any of the tanking specs, and maybe balance druid. And maybe ret paladin. Other than that it's all you, dude.
---
I was saving my vacation for this release.  I’m to burnt out so I’m taking it next week.. I’ll only have one week left.. RIP
---
&gt; Like waiting for ya swing and one damage move? Actually curious.
---
Two damage moves. Consecrate and judgement are both part of the rotation.
---
Against UD it's three damage moves!
---
How about you hop back into what ever time machine you came from and GIT!
---
And one for my Hunter as well.
---
Wants to play a pvp server , but dosent want to be ganked.... wtf even is this post ...

---
What are the challenges ? Buffing the right buffs on people before some one yells at you ? Haha /s
---
[Tough Hunk of Meat]
---
there's a difference between being killed by someone you can reasonably fight back against, than being killed by someone where even if you got everyone in the zone to work together you would still lose. 
---
I'm ok with ganking as long as the person ganking me isn't 40 levels higher than me, how is that not clear enough from the post?
---
And a Sulfuras for my Shaman alt offspec
---
Most guilds when I raided in vanilla deffinitly used vent. Even had a few UBRS runs that used vent.
---
69?
---
I think it really depends on server populations/How healthy blizzards keeps the server pops. I think at later stages in progression they may have to open up xrealm bg.
---
Cleansing poison on this fight is a first class ticket to wiping.
---
Nope, hence, it is a profession.
---
But it is possible for nearly every recipe or plan to be completed free by farming your own mats, with few exceptions.
---
A wow profression is an art.  You put in the time to become a master.
---
Iwas in the biggest leveling guild on my server (pserver, recently) and folks volunteered to come help me if when I was getting ganked in STV. If they’re not around, I’d just go to Desolace.
---
Guildie logged on his 60 alt and flew all the way to Tarren Mill to help me get my WW axe. These are total randos on a pserver.
---
My point is that there should be homies on your faction to back you up. If that fails... just go to westfall lol.
---
And if you can’t handle all that, switch to a PvE server. No judgment or anything. But I’m not seeing the “serious flaw” here.
---
Yup! It's an opinion I'm terrified to express in regular WoW circles. I just love the fact that Classic is going to bring together misfits like us.
---
Soooo cool
---
Thats why ive always tried to pick a profession my character can actually benefit from.
---
Found the supply side capitalist
---
I had a 19 twink in Classic and only remember accidentally gaining exp by exploring areas (or obviously killing mobs). If you want to use the WSG vendor and not gain a single exp, you could always explore the full area before you hit 19. 
---
Even if you are 19, you aren't going to be anywhere close to 20 just from exploration.
---
AB is being released at phase 4. Battle masters were not added until after AB release.
---
Well how did you hit 20 when you gain zero xp from bgs
---
and still end up near the healers.
---
Then you will just be rolling me in WSG instead ya dick.
---
I bet being SL/NF in AQ 40 basically meant you were a tourist :p
---
I have legit seen complaints that pvp gear is available in phase 2 (before battleground.)
---
I rolled an alliance warlock and launch and at that point they were *very* weak in PvP. You need to keep in mind that the class was never finished before launch and the rework in patches 1.8 and 1.9 was *huge*. You also have to keep in mind that Will of the Forsaken lasted **20 seconds** at launch and was nerfed to 5 seconds later on.
---
There definitely was a time when alliance locks had a tough row to hoe, but by 1.12 things had gotten much better.
---
Thats pretty damn genius
---
Well yes, but losing battlegrounds to premade teams in 5-7 minutes is much different than being hard camped out in the world day in &amp; out; rankers camping level 50+ zones will still occur but at least WSG will get them away for a bit, enough to complete quests, etc.
---
That's my experience, i wasn't in very hardcore guilds though
---
Modern and Classic WoW are two entirely different teams aimed towards two entirely different crowds. They'll continue to push updates for Modern WoW for the Modern WoW audience while leaving Classic for the Classic audience.
---
Whose to say phase 2 isn't 7 weeks?
---
Role playing what though? A guy who died falling off a zeppelin and now haunts it as a ghost lol
---
Yeah, Anal [[Dirge]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=23555/dirge) was pretty popular on my server, but that wasn't until BC. I don't really remember item spam aside from TF in vanilla.
---
Let's be honest, hunters doing 98 damage per hit is a decent contributer to the wipe to begin with.
---
People are going to tell you it doesn't matter. Sure play a bloody warrior or rogue if you want to wear dungeon blues and crafted gear for 6 months.
---
If you ever want to see yourself in a full tier set roll a Tauren druid.
---
Yup. That pretty much summarizes the last few months of Wrath...
---
Naw man.. Maybe in hardcore world first pushers, but not for your casual group.
---
There are soooo many ways to work around this challenge. People have been doing it for 15 years. If you can't figure out a way without complaining on reddit, you should go to a PvE server.
---
Since wrath you can gain xp fr9m bgs.
---
But also since then, you can turn off xp gains.  You will however, only queue with other twinks that have also turned off xp.
---
Since no one fucking knows this, queues are pretty much non existent
---
I can’t second this enough. Which one do you think is cooler? Which one feels better? I promise those matter way more in the long haul than what the classes are good at on paper.
---
Sometime between now and the distant future. Quite possibly in summer.
---
My dude... &gt;_&lt;
---
Just put on a dress and heal , you can do it even as ret.
---
The cool thing about hybrids in vanilla is that you're flexible ( some hybrids more than others).
---
People usually route significant quest rewards into their leveling, yeah. If you are looking to speedlevel you wouldn't pick rogue anyways.
---
How broken was it when it was the most played game on the planet? I think you’re the one that’s broken, IMHO.
---
I would say so Tauren get an aoe stun vs. the orcs blood fury that last 15 sec and has a -50% received heals debuff
---
Often times i see a group (2-3) going around killing everything in sight in lakeshire, good luck convincing 3 lvl 60s to come to your aid in a coordinated way.
---
I've also noticed that in cases of lone trolls, even after you wait and manage to get a lvl 60 to help kill the troll, the trolls manages evasion through sneaky means such as hiding and taking control of their pet to attack and continuosly reviving them, or just going stealth and coming back a few mins later. The lvl 60 helping will almost always lose patience with these trolls and leave.
---
Yes and no.  When it was announced youd be able too in bc, people started doing it mocking being able to link stuff.
---
The meme was born before it was even possible to do it.
---
Sucks both are you getting lightly down-voted, because you're just speaking your mind like everyone else. But you definitely don't go to a flat earth party, and start talking about how curvy earth-chan is either.

I cant enough of this template

It won’t be a big issue if we have similar population caps as vanilla around 3K. Your experience on a private server is blown out of proportion for a few reasons. 
---
1. Those servers are very large, so way more people trying to push rank.
---
2. Those servers are global (meaning people are on 24/7 from diff time zones farming ranks)
---
In a normal 3k server; the amount of “try hards” will be smaller and less impactful. Will their be flight master camping? Of course. But it’s won’t make the game unplayable.
---
It's got everything. It's got water, sugar, and purple.
---
&gt; I promise those matter way more in the long haul than what the classes are good at on paper.
---
I think people tend to forget how much time we're going to spend *getting* to 60. You have to like simply playing the class.
---
It doesn't bother some people as much as it bothers you. There's nothing to be ashamed of by joining a PvE server, but you can't honestly expect the PvP ruleset to change just because you don't like it. 
---
That's preposterous.
---
Because it "won't be the same" - and they'll "think they do, but they don't" like they keep trolling everyone else. And when it costs money, instead of making a donation (which most of them don't do anyway), it'll be far worse, because "Blizzard doesn't listen" or things aren't quite as much fun anymore, because (fill in the blank) so they'll just go back to their private servers (like they did even when vanilla was still running) because they want their special... whatever...  
---
But they don't want to be called "casual" so they'll dedicate soooo much energy into making "better server experiences than Blizzard offers" (which will eventually be shut down anyway), resulting in wasted time and effort for all of them and their cronies.  
---
Ultimately, they will loudly announce to everyone who isn't listening, that they "played the game their way" and are "leaving on their terms" to "do bigger and better things" - at which point the entire player base will never miss them and the game, and our interactions as a playerbase will all become so much better somehow...
---
To be fair.. Its good on arms warrior for what, 1 raid tier? Maybe? Before any general fury warrior in AQ gear beats it out? Might as well put it on a shaman alt :^)
---
I love both these classes. The most fun i ever had was leveling up as a tauren druid. Cat dmg -&gt; stun -&gt; heal -&gt; bearform it is very dynamic and super fun. That being said hybrids and in particular druids are not that great in pve raiding. 
---
There will be 5-8 Resto shamans in your raid so there is arguably the most competition for shaman gear. 
---
Resto druid is on the other hands usually only 1 or sometimes 2 so there is no competition for tier gear as a druid. 
---
For lvl 60 raiding , 5mans and also PvP, shamans have the better tools and are in higher demand. It is not hard to find a spot as a druid, though you may have to show some effort because you are the underdog. 
---
Feral druid has bad dps!!! There is a way to raid as a cat dps, it is known as Powershifting. 
---
This is a YT guide on Powershifting by shedo.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2t7qG9SrVI
---
Your list is not helping you cause most of the stuff on there is iffy or just downright wrong.
---
Its objectively faster to level only running the instance once, with a full roster of quests for said dungeon. But like others have said, it's about fun first and foremost, so whatever you find the most enjoyable will be the most rewarding. I personally only run dungeons more than once if there are specific pieces of gear that will last for a good chunk of the leveling experience. Like that cloth helm from SM cath, or the Raging zerker helm.
---
It's almost like you can get high level people to help you and start some wpvp, you could hearth and go quest somewhere else, or just log off for a bit and do something else.  
---
But instead you choose to cry about it on reddit lmao.
---
In an ideal world no because they get benediction. But in reality im sure there are priests that will roll on it. Specially if they pvp.  Resto Druid also want it for bis. You could also go for claw of chromag but you will be rolling against warlocks and mages.
---
Rolling as a paladin, you are inducted as a new member of the Silver Hand. 
---
Which I have always found very interesting because except from yourself and the pally trainers, the Silver Hand is virtually defunct during vanilla. Tirion Fordring went AWOL, known members are either dead or became the leadership of the Scarlet Crusade (or Argent Dawn in a few cases maybe). 
---
That the Silver Hand disappeared between WC3 and WOLTK is I think implied by Tirion "reforming" the Order during WOLTK.
---
Winter in australia is basically summer in northern europe :p
---
If it's for 7 weeks then it's fine. 
---
Then problem is that there's 7-8 months between launch and phase 3 if they follow blizzlike timeline. That means either phase 1 to 2 is long or phase 2 to 3 is. Diremaul came out immediately after maraudon (which is where we are starting), so something tells me they don't want to wait too long for diremaul, and thus phase 2. Honestly we really need a phase 2.5 for wsg/av alone.
---
These damn wrath babies i tell ya.
---
Spoiled.
---
So in conclusion, it's basically useless.
---
Also this is for the +5, not per skill for those who might miss understand.
---
Yeah...can't wait to see those hideous red plate boots. Where were they from again? Scarlet Monastery?
---
Don't you think that would ruin immersion or a major aspect of gameplay philosophy? When you level on a PvP realm you know that at any moment a player can kill you. You adapt if you see large groups of the opposite faction/ a single 60 controlling a portion of the map. Form a group, invite a friend, pay a higher level to help you, level somewhere else.
---
In the game these two factions are at war so from a 'lore' point of view, would it make sense to implement rules? 
---
Blizzard had to balance these two aspects of immersion and gameplay.  I think the choice of a PvP realm or PvE works well.
---
I hate playing as DK though. I like Bowser more.
---
Im straight up sub with 2 daggers.  F it if i aint doing it right but i dont seem to have any problems.
---
... last I checked 1.6 &lt; 1.7

---
Oh, should've added that DHK's should be limited to quest giver's outside of major city limits...  
---
Inside the city, "citizens" should be fair game, but I think it would be fun to raise their level to 50-55 (unarmoured), and instead of fighting back, make them seek assistance when under attack!
---
Hahah
---
Well lets say it like this, the gear that we are releasing in phase 2 but technically only really obtainable around phase 3, was released in patch 1.11, which is phase 5.
---
And it's not just HWL gear. The blue set is massively stronger and for lots of classes uses 2set blue is BiS until late BWL or even AQ.
---
31 and 1 boomkin.   Wouldnt want to make things too easy.
---
Haha, i love the looks of the calico set (especially in females, wink*). I would wear it to roleplay a secret agent, 007 style while playing a rogue. Memories of 007 n64 comes to mind.
---
1. Orc/Dwarf
---
2. UD/Gnome
---
3. All other races

(For PvE pick whatever)
---
I can't wait to hit 60 and get some TV Antenna's on my shoulders.
---
I guess my class isn't too hard to guess...
---
When I learned to strafe instead of backpedaling, but still had to quickly blind people in wsg. I switched from clicking and backpedaling WSAD, to WER keybinds and mouse over macros all at once. Took some time getting used to.
---
I don't think a lvl 60 occasionally killing a low level for looking at them the wrong way should be discouraged from a game design perspective. But if the lvl 60 is going out of their way to kill low level players while hiding when a higher level player comes to challenge them then yea, that totally is dishonorable and fits perfectly with the immersion and lore.
---
You are 22 years old. You said you started playing wow when you were 12 back in 2009.
---
I guess I misremembered that. I always thought there was AB/WSG/AV battlemasters were a trio and not a duo.
---
The weird thing about transmog is that it was obviously intended to give more variety and customization options, so that if everyone is running around in BiS gear (sic) you can look different than all the other Max level chars of your same class. 
---
But what actually ends up happening is that your character looks the same all the time, and you end up with fewer unique-looking people running (or standing) around.
---
It's a quote from Taken, my guy.
---
Me and my buddy are duoing shaman warrior in classic! Hell yeah
---
I like my build, it only differs from conventional wisdom a bit.
---
I always start with 2/2 in remorseless strikes. Having ~50-60% crit on your first SS of a fight is a massive benefit. Probably the best early talent IMO.
---
From there I get 2/2 improved SS, and 3/3 improved gouge. Improved gouge + immediate bandage will save your ass, a stun with a combo point and a big heal feels almost like cheating. 
---
From there I rush to riposte, because it’s gangster. This gets it at 22.
---
5/5 precision because not missing makes your kill time a lot quicker. 
---
Rush blade flurry via dual wield spec for damage output. Finish dual spec. 
---
3pts into sword spec
---
2pts into weapon expertise
---
Finish sword spec
---
1pt aggression or random utility (2-6% on SS and eviscerate isn’t a big difference in kill speed.)
---
1/1 Adrenaline rush

Dump points into assassination 43-60
---
Also you don’t need to get attached to swords until you can get guaranteed good ones from the RFD, SM, and Mara quests. I frequently go “combat nonspecific” and just grab the hardest hitting MH and highest DPS OH I can until I get good swords in my low 40s.
---
You still rush the same talents, but you get lower cooldowns instead of a damage boost. Getting a better weapon will help you more than getting 5% chance doublestrike on a shitty weapon. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZG0EdoVz0fo
---
Obviously swords are better if you can get good ones 30-40
---
Except that it isn't only R14 weapons, and it isn't "1 person who is getting good gear". The R14 weapons aren't as much of an issue as the blue and epic PVP sets. Some of these set items are BiS until AQ/Naxx. Some of the R12/13 items are BiS for the entire game.
---
R14 gear was updated in patch 1.6 so there's a case to be made that it's not a big impact for it it is in the game early since it was updated on the BWL patch.
---
R12/13 gear, on the other hand, has 1.11 (Naxxramas patch) stats before BWL is even released. Ditto for the blue PVP set, which is much more easily obtainable. Did I mention that some blue set pieces are BiS until Naxxramas?
---
This is as big of an issue as getting DM at launch. Especially since there is a much smaller time gap between launch/DM and PVP system being introduced/PVP items being updated.
---
Time is money, friend.
---
I agree about the immersive experience. Leveling professions as you go, taking your time with smart pulls, making sure you got some weapon upgrades through crafting or dungeon runs. 
---
As for OPs leveling experience, one thing that helps quite a bit is staying a level or three above the.mobs you're killing, when possible (ie once you're outside the starting zone). Plan a route that minimizes travel and maximizes your efficiency in terms of kills/xp per hour. You'll hit less on level 5 mobs at level 6 and 7. For your specific instance I like the do the farm quests straight away, and basically get yourself to level 7 or 8 before hitting that mine. Grind on the boars for xp and meat to level cooking.
---

I always chose NOT to tell him my naughty secrets . Just so he would scotch me a little longer.

Why did I read this as"I got my cooldowns ready"?

k
---
Had a few close calls like this in Vanilla and TBC, but usually with a few guys left. The closest thing to this I ever experienced was cool, but nowhere near as epic. It was my guilds first full clear of heroic LK 25man. Myself, a Shaman (elemental - he had to heal instead) and our tank managed the last 3% to force Arthas into the final cutscene.
---
Yes, and horde have to content with fear ward.  Also shamans have tremor totem for fear.  But if you dot people up and death coil, or sacc your pet.. or seduce with succ.. or many of the other tools the warlock has for survival wh ile you wait for wotf to fall off.. you'll be fine.
---
Why would we give a druid weapon to a shaman?
---
I was in a guild that had the first kill go from a doom proc.  We were worried the summoned demon would kill the ss'd priest.  Easily, top 3 moment from vanilla
---
Two ways to avoid this.  
---
Raid in 2006.  
---
Roll Horde.
---
Australian's started that. Granted we may have catered it towards foreigners, but it may also be a regional preference.
---
Some people like to be the bad guys in games. This is the textbook example of that. I like that a lot. Getting ganked like that injects faction hate and makes you pvp in the open world because you stopped taking any risks and started killing any red player you see before he/she gets that idea. If you don't like pvp with minimal rules you should consider a pve server.
---
Joke's on you, I don't even have a job.
---
hahaha
---
haha
---
ha
---
Do you always troll when you lose an argument?
---
In our friends and family guild we just flat out told people that if they really cared about friends and family then they wouldn't ask us to carry their asses through the later bosses of MC and beginning of BWL.  Some of them quit raiding for good....which was cool because we were pretty much full up anyways and it solved us from having further awkward conversations with assholes who insisted that their shit gear and spec was entitled to a raid spot because we were a friends and family guild. Horde for life.
---
You're the expert, Mark
---
Very cool!
---
Yeah, careful telling people that it's better not to have all the bells and whistles of retail - some folks are miiiighty sensitive!
---
If I recall correctly the majority of casual players knew there was a mount involved in the AQ opening, but few used the term Scarab Lord at the time.
---
Whoa, they have antenna's for TV's now!?!? Guess Smart TV's are a thing of the past!  
---
  
---
(kidding)
---
All it takes is one dominant guild on a server to make it a very bad time for most players on the opposing faction. Less players doesn't mean much, since they're still competing with eachother (and possibly others outside the guild) for Bracket 1 spots. 
---
Less population just means less total honor per week, that doesn't change the amount of RP you get per week though and people will still need to farm 16 hours/day to compete.
---
I'm willing to agree that we don't have real winters.
---
Australian winter = That time of year where you don't burn outside.
---
Last year I think there were only a handful of days that were still below 0c when I was walking to work in the morning.
---
Great post. Please listen Blizzard.
---
I never really was huge into it, my brother taught me to key bind when he introduced me to WoW. 
---
That said, what made me start using more than like 20 key binds total was actually doing PvP and wanting to get better, and I watched some YouTube guides on PvP tips. Key binding was covered.
---
If some guy is camping redridge why do you keep going back there? 
---
 Just go quest in darkshore or loch modan dude.
---
Man you got rocked on this post lol
---
I learned how to actually navigate a keyboard properly by playing WoW, not much of a stretch really.
---
Yea, and it's still possible to do that with that minor change, but now your honor rating is shit and everyone will know your reputation as a cowardly lowbie killer. Which is perfectly inline with the lore imo.
---
This thread is nonsense honestly. Down voting.
---
THEN FIRE ZE MISSILE
---
Ret is useless till Naxx.....
---
Do I like retail WoW? No. But I also don't really blame blizzard for it ending up as it has. It's just.. a very difficult thing to do. You have players screaming for changes and new content and an easier progression, then often the same players yelling in your ear about how they miss how the game used to be, how they liked the old "journey", how progression feels artificial now as opposed to the previous progression that was also artificial.
---
So I mean, I'm hoping that they take a similar approach to old school RS. Just, keeping the game as vanilla as possible- minor updates, nothing huge, everything done to keep the "spirit of the game". The only problem with that is that runescape is inherently a longer game, so they can get away with doing that much easier than WoW can. 
---
Basically, let retail and classic be separate. If people prefer retail, that's fine- who cares. Don't get mad at blizzard for failing a nearly impossible task.
---
Wear tier in town and when you're actually doing something use bis.
---
Private servers at launch are a clusterfuck (but they also have dynamic respawns). Yes Blizzard is sharding the starting zones, that doesn't mean the starting zones will be empty, they'll still be very full but it'll still be slow going at first.
---
I played holy priest main and loved having rets in my group. Honestly as a healer the class I hate the most is rogues. Rogues fucking SUCK to heal. Period. There is no other class that sucks as bad as healing rogues. Even warlocks when they tap like crazy are fine. Rogues are the worst. Rets are fine dude. Don't forget to DI the priest if shit goes sideways! ..and thanks for the Wisdom buff! :)
---
I googled  Sopaipillas  to see what it was. Sounds interesting.
---
I think I'll whip up a massive pot of soup so I can have mugs of hot soup all the time. My fridge doesn't have much in it so the whole pot of soup can fit in there and it won't go bad.
---
One of the foods I like while gaming is cocktail frankfurt sausages wrapped in puff pastry, so I'll also stock up on those.
---
What's your website?
---
So I suppose it depends on what your plans are, but if you are thinking about swapping professions mid leveling process, I would recommend starting off with at least Skinning. This will help you get some extra gold while leveling. And then you can pick up mining while leveling and just stockpile the materials when you decide which profession you would like to pursue. 
---
Between Blacksmithing and Engineering, I think blacksmithing only becomes worth it if you obtain one of the rare recipes early such as Lionheart Helm, other than that it is hard to craft gear that will be useful with the nodes you are mining in the leveling zones. Engineering is just a solid choice all around for PVE and for PVP; for PVE it increases your DPS, threat, and many other things. PVP it is basically required with bombs and trinkets.
---
I too am rolling Tauren war and my plan is to start with Skinning/Herbalism(taruen get an extra 15 skill points). And at 60 switching to Engineering/[Alchemy/Enchanting/Herb](not sure which of the three yet).
---
Hope this helps and my info is accurate!
---
You're probably right, but for some reason I was thinking the instance with Cenarius
---
I was in the zone Uldaman is in, forget the name these days, and found a chest with a blue dagger The Ziggler in it, sold for 120Gs and finally bought my mount at lvl 53...

Seriously. No one iS UNDERSTANDING MY WEIRD QUIRKS LATELY OMG REEEEEEEE
---
Ok, while I think what you say could happen...I think it's more likely that there will be an unspoken BG in Hillsbrad between Southshore and Tarren Mill. Both sides will WANT to kill each other, so why travel around and have to look for low levels that give a few HKs when you can kill other rankers in Hillsbrad?
---
I don't think I'm too far off the mark on this one
---
This is living proof that back then we had NO IDEA what we were doing with UI layouts. This just looks so odd to me.
---
But always love seeing these posts. Because it’s nice to know this was a universal thing back then, not just me lol.
---
After I watched swiftys warrior tricks video waaaaay back. Opened my eyes how slow I was lol.
---
Druid 2 is what I need for my life
---
There's two main reasons:
---
Farming HK's in a large PvP group is very inefficient; you'll make way more honor per hour camping Flight Path's, Dungeon entrances, etc. than you will doing TM vs. SS PvP.
---
You run the risk of accidentally getting a DHK while in a large group, since you have no control over who does what or doesn't realize they're about to 2-shot a civilian. It's way too big a risk to take. In a small group you probably won't be near too many civilians and even if you are, they know to CC them and get away ASAP.
---
&gt; Added in patch 1.11.1.28211
---
ya sure
---
Hey, at least their username checks out.
---
One of the bigger issues with why they are not always accepted for dungeon runs is they can take gear away from warrior tanks. Since tanks are 99% of the time the hardest role to fill you're basically left out in the cold. Especially since dps is a dime a dozen. Where you can win is if you can find a group with a druid tank or even druid healer. 
---
The other problem is lack of CC which is a real big problem in Vanilla. Multi mob tanking, particularly in the early going, is a real bitch for a variety of reasons
---
Sounds like a good suggestion. I hope blizz reads this topic and considers preparing for it.
---
Unlocking WSG even after an extra week would be understandable if there were problems on PvP servers.
---
I'll be safe on my happy little carebear PvE server though. :)
---
Black lotus in vanilla had 6-16 spawn points in the 4 zones that they could spawn in. They had from what we know roughly 1 hour respawn time. These spawns were cluttered up which means you could make a black lotus mafia where only you know the respawn time, and have multiple characters spread out ready to pick the black lotus at the spawn time. This happened so much on pservers that they had to introduce new custom spawn points on two individual different servers so it's a widespread problem.
---
Here's an example.
---
Black lotus spawns in EPL BLIZZLIKE: https://i.imgur.com/WLxG3qL.jpg
---
Black lotus spawns in EPL on Kr0nos: https://i.imgur.com/VhytsHH.png
---
Black lotus spawns in EPL on nost/LH: https://i.imgur.com/sQcEUPI.jpg
---
Sure private servers also increased the spawn rate. That is really besides the point. I think it's only fair that you randomly stomple upon a black lotus while herbing, than you having multiple lvl5 characters with find herb scouting for you (Yes people did that).
---
As a filthy casual who plans in taking their time, I'm probably gonna skip the first week to avoid the crowds
---
To me that was a reminder that I haven't arrived yet. I still need to improve. Looking good at low levels didn't matter, because what mattered was that I had more to do to get to where I wanted to be. And if I had to look like a goon to the rest of the world in order to achieve my dream, than so be it...  
---
But to each his own - I've never been accused of having "style"
---
Vanilla EXP rates on the latest popular private server were fixed. They were the exact same as the quests on the Classic demo when testing.
---
They haven't said how long the phases will be. Phase is is fairly minor with no raid release. For all you know they could be planning on it only being a month.
---
You have to keep raising your bar. Try harder, play longer, try things that seem out of reach. It will raise your skill level overall. You might fail, but you will learn something in the process. 
---
Also, practice and pvp. And stick with 1 class. Don’t make 7 alts. You will forget your keybinds on your main and you will lose your situational awareness.
---
Weren’t there those fuzzy bear claws from zg or was that tbc?
---
Honestly, there were a lot of people who raided vanilla in full tier set, opting for the look over the "BiS" - and wouldn't ya know, they did just fine...
---
The most recent pserver to do this went from 5k to 3k in the one month of what we’re calling Phase 2 for classic. It was absolutely as bad as the OP described, and huge swaths of players L48 just quit. Then the server had insufficient L60s to keep a good PvP scene when battlegrounds launched. It was a complete failure and did huge damage to the health of the server. That said I had a ton of fun because I had two 60s already
---
Yes but you won't go from classic launch to BWL in 2 months. Those  7-8 months it took from launch to BWL has to be put between launch and phase 3. So it's likely that phase 2-3 will be at least 3 months.
---
...one more reason to forget about BiS and go with comparable gear that looks good (because it's more about player skill than gear, anyway).
---
&gt;By the time you get to whichever expansion gave you the base building stuff 
---
I mean, I didn't like wod either, but it feels like you're pretending not to know the name of the expansion.
---
Welcome to hunter scaling :-P also we used Hunters as NAture Resist soakers on that fight, so their already poorly scaling dps endgame is crippled even more
---
I got into MC much earlier than most of the server I was on in vanilla and I really think people forget how much better the weapons and tier gear is than the random mishmash of shit most players will have on early on. 
---
I remember having obsidian edge and some T1 and obsolutely shredding most players on my original warrior. Like if they didn't have a healer 2v1 was not big deal.

---
If they thistle tea, yeah. If not this is just wrong
---
Yeah, it makes a huge difference. Anyone can see by going and watching Pat's original Warrior PvP video - he had an OEB as well and was dumpstering other level 60s with it. Lots of damage from a mediocre sword from MC - imagine 1.12 versions of Spinal Reaper and BRE out on release.
---
Rogue poisons is a pserver bug, not working as intended

Things like this were why vanilla was awesome. Wish I could up-vote that twice

I was a rogue in vanilla and I clicked my cooldowns as well as keyboard turning.  Basically the only thing I didn’t click was my damage rotation.

This is the razer solution to our long finger problem

Helped me out immensely for all kinds of new keybind combos
---
Do not speak of our Gnome secrets.
---
My problem with the argument from the OP is that it assumes the only valid evidence comes from pservers (even apparently if you've never played on a pserver that followed a timeline similar to the proposal).
---
Black mount lord.
---
Found the action bars in the settings on day one, set my key bindings and never looked back.
---
This was Burning Legion EU.
---
Sometimes you stun the enemy before you judge!
---
As far as actual evidence goes; the only thing we have is from private servers. The meta will stay the same as it is on private servers.
---
Then just respec.
---
Or go play retail
---
I got the perfect thing for you. PvE server. No one Kills you, and you can watch carebears or my little pony while you level!
---
I use it to describe the quest chain, but after seeing what's required.... Not thank you.
---
Lmao Just like R14.
---
saved. great stuff! :)
---
I understand you played WOW before but not vanilla? 
---
As a warrior, if you play alone its not a bad idea to  find a good place to grind some extra xp where there is a good yield of mining nodes, grey items, skinning, food items for cooking or cloth for first aid.
---
It's helpful to have a level above the mobs where you're going next since you will have a higher weapon skill cap. Like going into westfall at 12 instead of 11 or 10 makes it less likely you will die in a one-on-one to the same mob. Also being a higher level helps in terms of avoiding pulling extra enemies. 
---
Also if you happen to pull two enemies from a camp you can hit one of them, making it chase you for a little bit longer while the one you did not hit leaves combat. Like a defias or gnoll camp where you cant take on all enemies as the same time.
---
Also its good to learn how to Hamstring-kite. It helps conserve your HP. Example: you have a weapon with 3.0 speed like a 2-handed weapon. While the the enemy has 1.0 speed, like daggers. Put up Hamstring on the enemy and try to stay out of their reach until you can attack again. If it's done correctly you will only get hit once instead of three times for each or your own swings.

Go play retail, or play a PvE server if you don't want to fucking play classic. This is classic.
---
Man you should have just said. RREEETT ME INN! The second frame
---
I think the *speed* running you're referring to here is the literal one.
---
Zappa
---
I dont think they had fire resist potions in vanilla.
---
Honestly play what you want, get in early with a like minded guild as you’re leveling, and go from there. Playing something that you enjoy will always be more fun than a class that may be more viable. So if you want to kitty go kitty!
---
but you could also argue that since AQ is the next gear upgrade from BWL and PVP R14, then its only fair to throw them into the same phase. what you choose to do with your grind is your own deal, some may go into BWL first to get items that help them with the pvp grind, others will pvp first to do BWL later on. even others will do a mix of the two. but not everyone will be grinding 16 hours a day in either area in order to min/max their characters. so its not a big deal. besides, we aren't even aware of when phase 1 will drop, we shouldn't concern ourselves with the other phases. blizz currently wants to milk BfA for as long as they can because they know alot of players will drop it for at least a couple months to play classic.
---
Except Hunters, tier sets are always BIS. At least we look fabulous while doing no damage.
---
Gotta use melee to maintain whelps!
---
You will never do AQ40 without a guild and it'll be a ruff go doing BWL. MC is somewhat PUG friendly later on. But you need a good tank still. 
---
PUG raid really wasn't a thing outside ZG and AQ20 in vanilla. Those didn't really go well from my experience. Maybe it will be different though. People have a bit more knowledge in general now, but trying to get 40 people to do the right thing at once is hard in a guild.
---
I can't imagine trying to get a group of randoms to not kill everyone on Baron Geddon for example. It's a simple mechanic but someone will fuck it up and you can't imagine trying to keep a raid together on that. One person while mechanics weren't as common, but they exist. 40 random people with no way to replace someone terribly fucking up....
---
Or even optimal leveling spec
---
Ret pally was more like to get plate DPS gear back then &gt;.&gt;
---
I plan to craft a Lesser Magic Wand for my Warlock too. The Undead starter zone has Scarlet Warriors for the 60 linen needed. If you follow the speed leveling guides out there they tend to follow the barrens 12 step quest line up to step ten to talk to Mehren Skyseer and skip the rest. I am going to talk to her and then proceed to the hydra next to her Isha Awak to get the Branding Rod. It's 21.56 DPS 1.60 fire wand. I figure a decent wand will help me save my mana for unplanned world PVP. This wand worked great in the classic demo paired with the Pulsating Hydra Heart offhand at level 15. I'm not sure wands benefit from the fire effect though. I will be saving my mats too for the shadoweave.

Given a concurrent server max of 10k, how many people do you think would meet the criteria of flight camping ranker? Is it safe to assume the number would decrease proportionally for a concurrent server max of 3k? Do you think the percentage of the total population that will be hardcore rankers on the Classic server will differ from what was observed in pservers?
---
Roughly, how many total "flightpaths, instance entrances, zone entrances and really any other high traffic area in level 50+ zones" exist? Do you think each of these can effectively be locked out by the 3 man gank squads? Do you have an idea on the average number of gankers needed across the relevant zones?
---
Isn't this just really a self-deprecating post about OPs own guild?
---
We get it, your guild sucks.
---
another stupid ret paladin post, get some originality....
---
Potentially adding color to the characters would be nice, But great art and humor!
---
Ignore that post.  There are still DPS meters.  There are still people at the top.  It's just that being there is a combination of doing the most damage within your threat range.  It's more than simply maximizing damage output.
---
Warriors are top-tier DPS throughout Classic.  Mages come online in the later raids and are the dominant Nax dps.  Pick one of those.
---
Two things. First, where can I find guilds in advance for classic? I'm putting a ton of time into researching basically everything and I enjoy planning. It'd be awesome if there was somewhere to find a group before launch. Any idea where to look?
---
Second, I'm totally afraid to invest allllll that time to level only to be shunned and forced to beg simply due to spec choice. Idk whether to take that advice and go druid or what lol I like both but it sounds like both have... Limited options and aren't too popular or desired. And that blows. 
---
Thanks for response!
---
The unwashed masses?! How rude!
---
15 hks afaik
---
Should be, probably a Warrior in MC and BWL overall.
---
An ignite mage will probably take over in AQ40-Naxx. Warlocks start taking over the top spots in crazy good gear.
---
"Which class" for DPS is always a bad attitude to go about it. Every class is needed for different things, thats why all of them are brought to raids. You compare DPS to your own class, its like apples and oranges.
---
There isn’t anything preventing people from doing this in retail now either. Don’t want to get ganked don’t roll pvp.
---
The real War Ensemble was the home of Troxed on Illidan.
---
Poser guild.
---
CMV: A bunch of quests were made intentionally super low drop rates to make people grind levels under the illusion of doing a quest.
---
I think blacksmithing for a tank (assuming ur tanking since you're going tauren) is only good if you're going undead. With undead racial and the anti fear trinket from blacksmithing plus your warrior anti fear move you can't get feared by any boss in the game with proper play. Important for horde because of no fear ward. In light of this I'd just do mining engineer.
---
Shit! I played on Earthen Ring! First raid was this with my Druid
---
I’m sure it’ll be spread out more with the likely lower server caps Blizzard gives us. I don’t think this will happen on every server by any means, but I can think of a few Guilds who will be able to do so off the top of my head yes. Maybe not *every* area, but enough to make it a nightmare for the majority of people level 50+ trying to do anything on said servers. 
---
The Vanilla Honor System was only in the game for roughly 50 days before WSG and AV were added. My solution is to only add WSG (AV has way better rep rewards and is easier to farm honor in). Adding WSG will not even affect World PvP in general much at all below level 50. 50+, it’ll make a bigger impact but world pvp will still occur constantly.
---
Nice, good job man im happy for you, I hope to achieve something similar one day
---
A and D are strafe. Q and E are now staples. Made the change in wow years ago and god damn is it amazing.
---
In my guild in classic in AQ40 gear our fastest clear was 3 hours with a 10 minute break 2 hours in. 4 hours is pretty standard for full BWL geared guilds. Guy is just being an ass for no reason.
---
We had the same issue on gorgonnash-us the horde raid were full of drama, cant remember if it was on ssc or rsm the main tank stole all the guild bank and xfered to another server. Theres was like 3 pvp heavy guild. Them/lod and dogma, the alliance and super big guild like tko, ud, oblivion who had all the server first outside of mc/ony. The server pop was like 1.5 to 1, the horde was so much undergear, atleast we had great player like
---
Icypheonix/guerra/alho/tarquin/apedog/the entire legion of deathwing guild and the guys in them
---
Since vanilla people on private servers have realized spirit gear that helps you regen actually is pretty useful for leveling. Shockingly just because you kill 5% slower if you regen more you actually can level faster.
---
Future Narrator Voice: Chuck Norris was actually not cool.
---
To be honest I'm not sure. Maybe it was the long grind, or the stress of Mana when re-applying a seal after judgements, Or the SoC crit after HoJ. Or the struggle of having basically no attack. Maybe it's all of the reasons. Maybe I'm crazy. I don't know. I love the class and spec. I like unorthodox. 
---
TLDR: i just do. That's it. Do you need a reason why you just like a certain class? We all have a soft spot for a certain class/spec.
---
I hope not, it has some implications for gameplay. But mostly the aesthetic of the zones is changed when you see across the whole thing, its one thing I hate about retail. In wetlands you get the feeling of being in a swamp with the rain and haze. If you can see menethil from where you’re questing it makes the world feel smaller.
---
It's okay, let a few die and they'll stop.
---
Google “shattered hand clan”
---
Why the rocket boots when you can mount?
---
It doesn't hinge on casuals, but that also means we shouldn't literally beat them away from playing the game.
---
I realize this goes down the whole "casuals shouldn't be able to experience 100% of the game!" problem that Modern WoW has, but I think there's a defined difference between experiencing all raid content 2 hours from creating your character and merely being able to play it period.
---
If all these lowbie areas get camped religiously (and they will), these players aren't even able to experience the game ... at all. They won't even be able to take 2 steps from the FP before they're gunned down for a quick HK, then spawn-camped until they log off and just pray nobody is camping the GY/FP at night (which, again, will happen because there are quite a few night time players even in Modern WoW today.)
---
People saying “LOLRET CANT RAID” are just....infuriating. 
---
Motherfuckers in a 40 player raid, you have PLENTY of room for a couple of rets. And they have great utility. They aren’t going to top any damage meters, but there aren’t any fights (save Vael) that are going to have a DPS check so high that having 1-3 ret pal lies are going to wipe you. 
---
2 rets raided in my classic guild and they were fine, and awesome people to be around.
---
Soooooo the troll islands, the river on the border, ratchet viewable from the start zone and the beach along the other side are sandy wasteland?
---
I really enjoy durotar.
---
Ever picked up a peice of metal that was red-hot at one end? The other side will still burn your hands - yet he is holding them tight...
---
You wont! Creating an account is free nowadays, you can do it right now and even play until lvl 20 without subbing.
---
Yeah i agree tbh, it would definitely change the feel of the zones. Im sort of torn on it, because although i wouldnt mind increased view distance, i think increasing the distance that mobs are rendered would have a far greater impact, i wonder how they are going to handle it... i just wanna play this damned game already!
---
Ditto. I still kept S keybound to backpedal even though I literally never use it aside from the rare occasion that I tank.
---
Dungeons aren't the hard part, unless the group leader is (or is friends with) a picky DPS warrior... it's the raid slot you gotta worry about.
---
Everyone already knows you're lowbie killer. There is no need for official bad guy ranking. People organically make one. Besides, killing lowbies helps your faction. Ganking makes them quit completely or slows them down so your lowbies won't have to deal with them in future zones. You will see that in every zone. First guys who hit 60 will go back to help their guildies lvl up by killing quest mobs and every opposite faction member so you get everything and no one will gank your bois.
---
Personally, I use Q and shift-Q for stance dancing. Works well for me. Find whatever works for you, everyone's hands are configured differently in their mind.
---
dungeons are stupid anyway... grind them hks and av for sweet pvp gear
---
I liked the way they do it on K and N . As a casual raider I actually stumbled upon random lotus from time to time . It was a good system.
---
This sort of assumes no-lifers will all play on the same server. Total realms for vanilla servers these days... around maybe 10? Less?
---
Blizzard will have dozens of servers for Classic. The no-lifers get spread out as such. If somehow they all coordinate to go on the same realm, switch to another.
---
I mean, still more than just spamming frost bolts.
---
That’s what was said about Shadow Priests until debuff limits were improved at the end of BWL/starting AQ, and then suddenly people realized the value of increasing ALL of your warlocks damage, and healing the lock group through VT so they can life tap to their hearts content and not strain healer mana. 
---
GOOD rets that understand their hybrid nature, much like a shadow priest, are an amazing class to have available to your raid.
---
Lol'ed at that one haha. Jokes aside, ret paladins for PvP is quite good, and sulf is one of the Bis for ret PvE, but if we're being realistic that probably wont happen.
---
You're doing a pretty poor job of research then. Druids default role in raiding is healing. HOTW/swiftmend is the staple PvP spec and works to raid well enough to get through most raids as healer.
---
To add to this, subbing gets you everything pre-BFA. There is no longer a base game to purchase.
---
Not anymore though. Especially if world buffs go off without cooldown.
---
You got me there
---
I don't see it as much of a problem of when they are giving, but actually what version of the gear they are giving. They are giving the 1.12 versions of the gear that we're substantially buffed
---
The dissertation is riddled with dates like 2010 and 2012, talks of heroic modes and draeneis. Maybe there's some mentions of vanilla in there but this seems mainly geared towards tbc-wotlk-cata
---
The Nightfall tho..
---
Armour is a stat in vanilla lol
---
Maybe? Guessing Arms with a good weapon should be fine in MC, probably. Not that meme specs won't be taken just to fill the raid anyway
---
You could always turn down the view distance...
---
It is true that server was unpopular and it only got worse. To be fair not only because of Phase 2 though.
---
I fully support WSG in Phase 2 maybe better yet a Phase 2.1 launch of WSG shortly after.
---
Druid is a different style of PvP for sure, it is very desired though. Youre largely a flag runner in WSG and defender in AB. Druids strength is their mobility and toughness, their weakness is, well, piss poor damage. When youre not flag carrying, your best at arms length throwing out some heals and maybe trying to bait people into chasing after you away from other targets. Those same qualities lets you delay for a long time on flag caps in AB. Again, this is just a different style of PvPing, if its your thing then great, though Druid is the worst 1v1 class id say. Youll pretty much never use Cat form in PvP except to use Stealth, Sprint and Cheap Shot, you just die way too fast in Cat form and the damage isnt very good.
---
In absolute healing numbers, theyre the worst in raids, but every class is required in a raid, theres no point comparing apples and oranges. With fewer Druids in the raids, you also tend to get geared a lot faster than other classes, so keep that in mind.
---
Theres no such thing as Feral cat. Its just feral, you do Bear and Cat. Cat DPS is trash conventionally, youll hear a lot of people shouting about Manual Crowd Pummeler Druid doing good DPS, which is probably true, but its excessively tedious. Feral Druids are on the border between fringe and meme in terms of raid. Youll have to find a guild thats just starting raiding and try to get in on the ground floor to ensure a spot as Feral, even then, they might try to coerce you into respecing resto.
---
As for Spriest, great PvP class and a niche raid spot. Id say about 50% of guilds run 1 of them (and only 1). Tough to get the spot, usually need to know someone or again, start at the ground level.
---
Silver Hand existed outside of Lordaeron, especially in Stormwind which was one of major seats of Church of the Holy Light. Only the Lordaeronian branch of the order was destroyed/changed to SC or AD. Paladins from Stormwind never stopped calling themselves Silver Hand.
---
I’m lucky enough that my work doesn’t really require any notice, just gotta let them know when. As soon as they announce the date I’ll be putting in for the rest of that week off and playing my heart out. So pumped.
---
Just slap on some healing gear and you'll be let in. Easy!
---
I'd argue that Patchwerk and Loatheb are definitely dps checks. I'd still bring one ret for the Nightfall though.
---
Did you really have to post the same meme with minor alterations 3 times within five minutes?
---
Rets don't buff wisdom as it's quite high in the holy tree. And why are rogues so bad to heal? As a warlock I always thought I was the one the healers hated.
---
This is only true for raids. In dungeons every class has utility spells they need to use depending on the situation.
---
Mages spam frostbolt but they also nova, blizzard, use polymorph, dampen/amplify magic on friendlies depending on the fight. They might kite an elite mob because the pull is too big.
---
A healer is constantly juggling party health and his own mana, trying to get as much mana out of spirit as possible.
---
Engineering safe bet for both tanking and dps in both PVE and PVP. Mining can help supplement it or alternatively alchemy and sell transmutes and make your gold besides gathering professions. If you are a MT of a guild and can get recipes for blacksmith then BS is good otherwise I would skip it.
---
Imo either Engineering + Alchemy (if you can grind for gold) or Eng + Mining but from what I've heard engineering is usually not that expensive to level and the only things you are resupplying are the bombs so you might be able to farm out most mats yourself if you go mining then drop mining for something else.
---
For leveling I would recommend Skinning + Mine/Herb
---
Cccccccombo breaker!
---
 Yeah it's giving me flashbacks to one. Was it 'Beyond Booty Bay' or 'West of Booty Bay'? Something like that, v different art, similar humor.
---
That's who says that!?! I've had that line in my head for 15 years and not known where it came from!
---
&gt; Even the people that play for a long time will probably stay subbed to classic for the same amount of time regardless if it releases two months later on not.
---
No, they will stay subbed 2 months LESS if you release it 2 months later. If they had released classic 2 years ago, they would have had a loads of playing on nost, elysium, lightbringer etc paying full sub all this time.
---
You wont get that money ever back that you didnt make previously.
---
Your logic to even out the content is based on the fact that they want the RETAIL ppl leaving, resubbing because of classic. Those are the people that sub for 1 month and thats it. If they ever even do that, since Wow classic is totally different game.
---
Only thing that saves retail subs is to make the game good again. Not by putting out a "classic" trinket for them to chase for a month or two. Classic makes its own revenue of CLASSIC players that couldn't give a flying fuck about retail.
---
Why would blizz care, if you pay one sub for both of them?
---
You could not lock down individual black lotus nodes based on a static respawn timer in retail vanilla, it was not a thing despite what pserver people say. 
---
I don't know exactly how it worked, but I spent hundreds of hours farming herbs and lotus on retail and I never had a problem supplying myself with flasks (plus extra to sell). Private server lotus behavior (and resource nodes in general) are way different than retail.
---
 I wouldn't worry about it at all until we see how things work on official servers.
---
I never got to do Loatheb (the perfect Spriest fight too), but yes I agree Patch would be the other major DPS check that would hurt rets viability in the raid for sure.
---
Dam dude, don't know how the lv 5 herb scout would work in the high level zones 😂 I'll take your word on it though tbh I'm not gonna even bother with herbing gonna get mining and spam tons of DME for that arcanite crystal farm for TF. 
---
Curious to see if they add the one black lotus in AV aswell. I had 2 60s in vanilla and I dont remember that at all back in the day.
---
Hmmm.. WarEnsemble was formed within a couple months of the games release, so no.... YouTube mysteriously has no vanilla content from them either, weird
---
Well, yeah, we know WAY more about that Raid and how classes work 14 years later, but AT THE TIME, that was what it took time wise, especially if you needed bindings/eye of sulf. 
---
Only guild on our server that never got both bindings. :/ Our tanks were so good even without TF, I can only imagine how much better they would have been.
---
&gt; Nobody will do MC to PVP if the PVP rewards for rank 10+ are going to be 2 tiers above MC....
---
MC is in phase 1, you cant do any ranking before stage 2. So you are saying that all the rankers will wait in their level up greens for 4 (?) months to start killing other players when phase 2 starts ? Fuck no. They want to get BRE from MC etc to have a edge in wPVP.
---
In Naxx we were server first on patchwerk and abomination quarter. Cleared up the whole place up to 4 Horsemen, witch we never even attempt as we had not enough tanks. One week before to 2.0 patch hit we stopped raiding to take a break and rest before the expasion, as people was starting to get burned and preserving them was deemed more important.
---
And be at a disadvantage no way!
---
They could also not alter the view distance from its original, as the intent of the game is to replicate Vanilla.
---
Sangre, Spinebreaker
---
Wow sounds a lot different than my experience here in the states. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
I'll just settle on it for my warrior. After that I'll probably PVP for a little while then quit.
---
We used TeamSpeak 2, I can't even begin to imagine how raiding without team voice could have been done even back then.
---
If you played rogue like autistic me in vanilla you’d bind WASDEQ all to spells/macros/items and double click move everywhere.
---
If you have your CD keys I'm pretty sure you can recover it. But what the others said, it's free.
---
Do you think it's harder to get r14 or to complete BWL?
---
What reward is better?
---
Brilliant dude, keep up the good work.
---
				&lt;Deus Vult&gt;  PvE, Horde 
---
				“Less Raids, Better Raids”
---
Who we are: Deus Vult is an 18+  guild which aims to level to 60 at our own pace, and progress through all the end-game raiding content World of Warcraft Classic has to offer while only raiding two nights a week.
---
When we play: 40 man raids will be on Fridays and Saturdays from 11 PM to 3 AM EST.
---
Guild organization: We are going to take a common sense approach to raid spot allocation and loot distribution using a Loot Council comprised of myself, the co-GM, and Centurions.
---
Players will not be penalized for missing raids every once in a while.  Life happens, and we aren't children anymore.  Players instead will be rewarded for putting more effort into raid preparation, helping guild members and showing up on time and ready to pull at 11:00.  Consumables are recommended and encouraged, but not absolutely required until AQ40 and Naxxramas.
---
Guild Ranks will include:
---
Social: Casual player, or a non-raiding friend.
---
Zealot: A full-fledged member of our core raiding team.
---
Templar: The top performers of each class will be granted the rank of Templar.  You will receive priority invites to raids and priority on rare or very powerful epics. Excellent, but not perfect, raid attendance and use of consumables is expected.
---
Centurion: Class leader.  Exceptional players who can coach others to be their best.
---
Primarch: Main tank and Co-GM.  He will receive all tanking upgrades before other tanks, including the guild's first Thunderfury.
---
Emperor: Simply put, I am in charge of the day-to-day boring stuff so we can all raid and have fun.
---
https://discord.gg/e5a937C
---
clearing BWL is not the same thing as getting BWL gear.
---
If you add up all the time required to farm, get consumable, get prebis etc. for it, it's a lot easier just to get r10.
---
I think I got 4-5 boss kills like that on my resto shaman in vanilla.  I always kept the heaviest hitting weapon I could find in my bags prepped with WF just in case we needed a valiant bum rush at the boss.  Sometimes I'd just say screw it and burn an ankh to try too.  &gt;.&gt;
---
inviteeee
---
Mate ret paladins are one of the best dungeon classes. Its raids where they really start to fall off.
---
Fun fact: First TF on my server went to a hunter.
---
So, just like Vanilla?
---
"Regularly, almost daily as I logged into the game, I tried to keep this confusion in check, reminding myself that I was an anthropologist first and foremost, that my lack of understanding of the game, gameplay, the MMO genre, or even basic skills, like how to chat with other players, or loot creatures I killed, was all part of the participant-observation process.This is why I played the game, I reminded myself: to learn."
---
So he was conducting in depth anthropological data, not playing wow....I'm sure that's what he told his girlfriend anyway
---
Blizzard, PLEASE Don't cater for the 0.01% that'll rush through the game.

Alright I'll never post here again you win, so much for having some fun

No time off, 2 month old, 5 year old; we’re going to create a family group;  alliance NA pve if you’re interested

The preferred method of millennials to deal with their problems; crying!😢
---
My other question would be if the Legion Client even allows such modification? i mean it probably does but what if it has some sort of consequence, like as it currently stands in Classic we wont be able to wall jump and get to places like Ironforge Airstrip.
---
I know ill get downvoted for this but i feel bad for your kid...
---
Reddit has ruined this for me apparently. “Am not a lawyer” was all I read. Sad times.

Because the title didnt exist.

This is awesome!
---
I hate transmog as well. All I ever wanted was a toggle to turn off viewing other peoples transmogs(And your own) that way they can look how they want on their screen and I can see what actual gear people are wearing.
---
My only guess is blizz hasn't and won't do this in live due to them releasing soo few different looking pieces each Xpac. (Fewer and fewer each xpac)
---
"Gnome slayer pauldrons"!  Night elf shield model #235
---
It’s just silly for OP to suggest the system is broken, when Vanilla WoW was one of the hugest games of all time.
---
Amazing This is my new background! Thanks man you are awesome!
---
Lol
---
What a weird guild philosophy. If you were a real family and friends guild you would‘ve cared about another people having fun even if it‘s a „weird“ specc they like to play. It‘s not carrying when that person is playing dedicated and trying to get everything out of their class. At least my point of view is that.
---
If you want to seriously PvP, then raiding to gear up is in your future.  In particular, raiding resto.  Your guild will be totally fine with this, by the way - they are happy to send balance and/or feral gear your way as long as the mages, warlocks, rogues etc. don't need it.  
---
I find raiding resto to be pretty chill, mindless yet not boring, I think it's a wee bit more engaging than Paladin at any rate, but that's the only other healer I've raided on.  For my money, feral cat is sorely lacking as a PvP spec (while we're at it, it's really not *that* bad for raiding, you can do some seriously impressive numbers if you learn to powershift and spend a billion gold on mana pots).

For solo/world PvP, or just to get the most sheer combat power on a druid, I'd recommend a deep Balance spec with Feral and Resto investment, or a Balance/Resto spec.  If you find yourself on a premade, expect the word "Resto" to come up in your spec in one shape or form.  Druids are utterly invaluable in WSG, okay-but-not-great-but-only-the-most-serious-tryhard-premades-will-reject-you in AB, and good in AV.

Tbh, you should be comparing it to aurastone or zg hammer (on non-priest mace users). Thats what kind of weapon you would be using compared to going full autistic in pvp. Unless your guild gets super lucky with lokamirs and you wont.

Three to four weeks ago we had an even closer call on her. A Mage killed her just after his death thanks to spell batching. Everyone was dead in the room.
---
Very interesting insight! I appreciate people like you!
---
I keep A, D, and S, default. Never need them in combat of course, but I too like the having the option outside of combat. Perhaps I'm picking my nose, flipping through menus, petting kittens, or running idle circles during raid, there's so many situations where I enjoy being able to carelessly run about without the use of my right hand.
---
Perhaps I have large mitts but with ~33 or so keybindings I have no issues, so I've never felt motivated to abandon them.
---
Personally though, I think caps lock is an underrated binding which never see mentioned. I unbind it's actual functionality on my keyboard, because who the heck actually toggles caps?

Surely. #nochanges has gone too far if people are against OCE servers...

I agree with no changes, but also I dont mind that some ppl will be getting great gear for doing something most other people cannot do.

Have you ever tried to rank? You need a special kind of commitment and life style to be able to do that.

But all in all it would be scaled like it was in vanilla

And now, ppl just breeze through huhuran without care in the world with peasant caller trinkets. No need for nature res gear.
---
And thank god for that. People are going buts about this no changes thing. Do people want the lag, disconnects, bad class balance, zone overload etc also?
---
Ah, I love a good 1% wipe, but a everyone-dead clear is even better.  I don't know why, but when things start to go horrendously wrong in a pull and my raidmates are dying like animals... it's just hilarious to me, I can't stop laughing.  This has carried over to other MMOs, mind you, it's gotten me yelled at by my raid leader in UCOB just the other night.  While we're at it, XIV has this odd quirk on hard enrages where everyone dies but the boss doesn't reset for a few seconds... if he dies then, you'll get the clear with an entirely dead party

Only exception: you already have a Paladin in your group.
---
I've been sitting with these exact thoughts since they announced it, but I haven't been able to put these thoughts down in text. I agree completely with everything you wrote, because these private server players have honed the efficiency of honor farming into an industrial level. The farming of players by these ahead-of-the-curve private server no-lifes will be insane and it will make a lot of people quite, I'm sure.
---
I had a similar case last year! I decided to try out retail again when I had a lot of free time and no other games to play, I haven't played since end of TBC or WotLK release. I can't remember exactly how it went but I wrote to support and had my email that I used for the account and I sent them my ID that was pretty much it since I didn't remember anything else from back then 2008. So I got my account back with my old characters, I didn't need my old CD keys but that maybe would help with identification I dont know?
---
But if you dont have any single thing or info about your old account, you dont have to buy the game anymore to play. They changed it so its only the subscription that you pay to play and then buy tha latest expansion if you want the endgame or something
---
Slightly Offtopic. I have two Account linked to my BLizzard account. One Classic Wow and one TBC. Will I be able to play both when paying the monthly fee?
---
Will I be able to play both at the same time? I am asking because my son is interested in playing.

I was curious because yay mount... then I looked into what was involved  and realized I don't have anywhere near that amount of time.

Powershifting, even if I was more of a semiclicker at best. Never got to be a full clicker. It felt too unpractical.
---
Pugs still take that long sometimes. Or if the raid is just braindead for some reason. I look forwards to being so overgeared that we can do an 20-man MC because those runs are so chill. Lot's of social talk and nobody has to call anything out because we know the raid in and out.
---
Ever since Wrath leveling gear has been ugly as hell, thank god for transmog in Retail.

The most beautiful, colourful pieces all come from Classic and TBC. I'm looking forward to what my dwarf will look like at 60
---
I looked through some screenshots from my Classic Demo folder and found some stuff that might apply here.
---
[This is a screenshot showing the graphics settings (Legion)](https://i.imgur.com/gnRrX3W.jpg), I *think* I'm playing on max/ultra settings if I remember correctly.
---
... [and here is some random screenshot of me looking into the distance.](https://i.imgur.com/ZkdaMna.jpg) So... no? I think that's vanilla view distance.
---
Patchwerk require 9k5 raid dps to be beaten. With 25 dps that's only 380 dps needed per person. Even a ret in pre raid bis can achieve that.
---
Make a mage one please 👍
---
I am SOLD, this sounds like so much fun to play. I am definitely going to play this build.  Come on classic!
---
sword of omen debatable but vanquishers is nearly essential.
---
They'll be on every server, and you only need a couple of these squads to ruin the whole server.
---
It do be like that sometimes. Do one for our poor healers :)
---
This is the most relevant response yet
---
It always depends on what you are looking for. In the first Stage I will look to get 440 Def rating so I don´t die from crits. Later when you don't need those 7 def I would go with kromkrush for more aggro. But i would probably rather go with the enchanted thorium breast. 
---
In fact there is no such think like BiS for tanks. It alway depends.

I did buy a used gaming laptop for $800 just so I can play at work.

Intel 7820hk, 16gb ram, nvidia 1070, 1600p gsync.
---
It seems to handle wow really well and I'm excited to have something to fill the boredom.
---
At home I bought a 3440x1440 120hz gsync monitor and an nvidia 2080 ti to pair with my 5ghz oc 7700k.
---
Can you believe that WOW BFA at 200% rez (Soo 6880x2880) can not hit 120fps in the blood elf starting zone!? It uses 99% of the gpu and I get around 70-90fps graphics set to 10.
---
It is one of the reasons I wish the wow classic demo client was still usable so I could test these things.
---
Do I need to save up for the next nvidia titan? :(

&gt;assholes who insisted that their shit gear and spec was entitled to a raid spot

I think this part made it clear, at least from his view, that they didn't really play dedicated and trying everything to make it work.
---
Sometimes you have to blink!
---
Great input.
---
And is the mob render distance also the same?
---
Will be interesting to see if Vampiric Embrace will be nerfed on Loatheb. IIRC shadowpriests could heal their group until patch 2.0, the TBC pre-patch. So they might be able to do that on Classic which will make the encounter pretty trivial.
---
Can we get some flairs? Or custom flairs?
---
Metal would probably resonate with more WoW fans though

Nice! I also am taking my vacation weeks when wow classic releases.

I'm also gonna be rolling a Tauren Warrior. I think I'm gonna go herbalism and alchemy and stick with it even at end game. May not be the best choice but I've never done herbalism and alchemy and since taurens get the herbalism boost I figured why not make use of it? I'll have plenty of alts for other professions and to make money with anyway.
---
I know we are getting into semantics now. But the data they have will be a nightly/weekly/... backup of a database.

By its very nature and definition a copy. 
---
Thanks for chatting with me. Have fun in Azeroth.
---
To be honest I really dislike Phase 2. I love PvP but only if it has no rewards. Once you add rewards every player starts to maximizing and gaming the system for the most rewards, instead of enjoying PvP.
---
For example if there are no rewards for PvP, only a handful of players would camp flightpaths. People would fight over resource nodes and fight for fun. Steamrolling another team gets boring quickly so the playerbase starts to find means to balance things out to make things enjoyable (like some people of the overwhelming force leaves the party/raid)
---
They built in lag with the introduction of spell batching.  Why not?
---
Lol this looks awesome. Onyxia killing people at the front, slowly moving forward, annihilating everything in her path. And the poor undergeared casters backpeddling, f.
---
Surprisingly good video quality from that era.
---
You're not the only one - but he is horde after all, you can't expect more from an animal such as this
---
On k3 a quite similar thing happened. They allowed everyone to queue into bg while they were anywhere in the world. What happened was that horde ranker (even semi casual one) started camping flightpath h24, groups were formed to find and farm any lvl 48+ levellers while they were waiting for their bg to pop.
---
The slight faction imbalance in favour of the horde became more and more massive since alot of people on alliance stopped to play and the problem became more and more important. They had to undo the queue from anywhere thing.
---
So now with no bg, the difference is that it will be both faction that will do this. And we can hope that rankers killing each other might somewhat solve the problem but the thing is when you kill someone 10 times he stop giving honor for the day so rankers of both faction will probably avoid each other once they have killed themselves enough times at the beginning of the day.
---
Thank you. I want to reiterate, please include **RP-PvP** in the list. Looking forward to the census!
---
You're right on with your character always looking the same, but fewer unique looking people? 
---
I've been rocking the full blackrock set since WoD and have only once seen someone else wearing it in BFA
---
AND it is more profitable to kill low levels (48-55)for honor than 60s. They too give honor but are vastly more easy to kill. Rankers will avoid other rankers because fighting equally determined players lowers efficiency.
---
 The whole system has so many flaws I can't even list them all.
---
If someone decided to quit Classic due to experiencing pvp on a PVP server, is that really a negative?
---
Survival of the fittest, etc. Weak willed people who complain about dying in a video game  generally do not fit well in an open pvp server enviroment.
---
Also I feel like the majority of people who would have an issue will already be on 'normal' pve servers.
---
If you choose a pvp server, and proceed to complain about wpvp and camping, you have legitmate carebear issues.
---
As manhof already mentioned, the hungering cold, or maybe TF. Both really iconic weapons.
---
Something similar happened on k3, the population was about 4k at most.  And it was not only try hard, even casual that wanted a few rank did it.
---
Class fantasty.
---
There is one problem with a complex game mechanic (PvP). Your solution? Disable PvP completely.
---
&gt;Rets don't buff wisdom as it's quite high in the holy tree. 
---
Blessing of Wisdom is a baseline ability, as is seal/judgement of Wisdom.  Holy does have talents that provide +20% effect to BoW, but even then you only need 17 pts in the Holy tree to get that.  So it's conceivable (probably unlikely in practice, but possible) for someone to have improved BoW and still go deep ret.

You are delusional. Every corporation works for profit. Every decision they make is for profit.
---
I'll have to disagree on this one, the savagery is what made these patches something special to me originally.   
---
Yeah these things are going to happen with honor farming, and its going to be fantastic.Half of the fun for me and my friends was dealing with people like this when called for help in general chat or major cities, and I think you'll find there will be people like that on whatever server you choose too that are quite happy to camp them to maximum Resurrection timer.
---
 I doubt as many people will quit in there 50's, especially if they're a casual, the amount of time expenditure would border on weeks/months+ to get into your 50s and you're going to quit just before 60 and all the end game content opens up? seems unlikely, more common to just log off and try again later.  
---
That being said a lot of wow classic is being able to put time, effort and persistence in trying to achieve your personal goals. There were no compromises.   
---
The kind of brutality you're concerned about is what myself and many friends are going to be re-subbing for, both the giving and receiving end. I want to have hour battles crop when I have things I want to get done just because that orc camped me on a flight master once. I can temper this hatred within the world while trying to get content done, and when wsg drops in P3, hopefully I'll see them in there to give those battles a little more meaning.  
---
Even with WSG added, these zones are still going to be prominent with 60s for node farming+ slower honor farming on the side, two birds one stone so to speak.  
---
In my opinion you shouldn't be able to walk around and complete whatever you're looking for with ease, part of the reward of getting there is the pain and suffering you had to endure &amp; **overcome**. It makes that level ding, quest completion, rare drop, getting that node from the scum who tried to fight you for it and watching the enemy initiator(s) running away/hearthing all worth-while.
---

Yup! We were really wanting to get to that fight so I, and the locks, could obliterate.

As neither have a reduced cast time talent they get the same hps benefit from increased healing. FoL gains more hpm because its starts out at a lower level though.

In no way does FoL scale worse than HL.

Its sad when being the most extreme piece of shit needs a /s but when it comes to ret pally you actually do need to add it when being sarcastic becasue the stigma is so shocking. Worst thing is I bet half these people have never played Vanilla or a private server let alone played with a ret during that time.

Burn their WoTF with the initial fear or seduce. Then use DC while they have it up. Then you are free to fear once or twice (depending on pvp trinket).

If they have the BS trinket as well, then your boned.

WoTF works against seduce too (charm).
---
God damn put this in a fucking vault, wow history right there.
---
You lack perspective.
---
What if, like me, you don't enjoy PvP at all, but you roll on PvP because your friends only want PvP servers and the thought of a PvE server is just an impossibility? I literally don't have a choice, because playing alone on a PvE server just won't happen, so PvP it is. 
---
And imagine these casuals rolling on PvP servers, hoping there will be outdoor PvP like it used to be. Obviously there will be that kind of PvP, but they're not ready to be farmed like cattle for hours on end, I'm sure. 
---
Weak willed or survival of the fittest? Come on, this isn't the animal kingdom, it's a game at the end of the day, and  being systematically farmed isn't enjoyable no matter how you slice.
---
And stop with the fucking carebear shit, some of us don't really have a choice but we do endure because our friends make us.
---
Oh boy I cant wait until I make the same mistakes I did when I first started playing, wearing half tank and half DPS gear and getting called a transvestite and pissing everyone in my dungeon group off by need rolling on gear that isnt optimal for my spec
---
They are green indeed, and the one raising max hp is purple I think.
---
Tanking by far. I did all three jobs in vanilla as a super hardcore no lifer. Tanking is a brutal job especially with pugs. With a guild or friends it’s far better because they’ll play appropriately. Otherwise you’re going to have to grit your teeth and bear it. It being retards who jump in and AoE right after you pull. 
---
My group always had the sunder rule. You didn’t dps until a certain amount of sunders were up and you assisted the rogue of the group if there was one to know who to target. 
---
Healing isn’t too rough. I will say don’t roll a Druid if you want to heal five mans. They’re annoying to heal five mans with. No regular res, only the single combat res. And their heals make it harder than it needs to be. 
---
Don’t listen to strictly private server players. They were glitchy as hell. Threat didn’t work as it was supposed to. Not much did. It’s going to be far harder to hold aggro on live than pservers where people think they have it all figured out.
---
Really good! Since you asked for feedback: You could probably omit panel 3 to make it punchier. That leap from panels 2 to 4 is what makes the joke hit hard - panel 3 kind of alludes to the punchline without adding to the comic as a whole

This makes July 16th even more likely. Think about it.
---
Mid June 8.2 releases. People resub for BfA
---
July 2nd, FF14 Xpac releases
---
July 16th Classic releases. Players want to return to WoW but need to pay the sub fee because 8.2 came out just a little over a month earlier and their sub has run out. Something like this happened in january of this year.
---
And they say robots will take over the world! Im laughing!
---
This is a great suggestion. I really want to be able to queue wsg the old fashion way while leveling in ashenvale or nearby.
---
You sound like your balkin after I just stuffed your BS vid
---
Question: how long will you provide server hosting for this? Is there a way to clone this for offline use? It is an incredible tool and very useful. I would hate to see it no longer available!
---
Subscription is for World of Warcraft account, not for Blizzard account. If you have two WoW account linked into your Bnet account, you have to pay two subscriptions if you want to play both.
---
What comes to "one classic wow and one TBC" such things do not exist anymore. Now days all content excluding current expansion (now it's Battle for Azeroth) can be played with only subscription fee.
---
So if you want to play Classic with your son it means you have to pay two subs. With same sub you are able to play also live version up to Legion.
---
Oh, these guys made it all the way to Onyxia in beta. I hardly left Silverpine...
---
Just makes july 16th chances even bigger.
---
I am all for changes like these. Give me better, faster rendering any day. Better servers that can deal with all the things the old vanilla servers couldn't etc. I want a classic experience but I don't feel the experience has to mimic the 2004 era technological barriers necessarily.
---
It is yes, but you'll have like 6 holy paladins with improved BoW and most of them skip improved BoM because they rather want talents in protection so they can AoE tank orb runs.
---
I’ve experienced levelling up from 48 to 60 in an environment like this. I can tell you first hand that SO many players will quit.
---
Even with high patience and even playing a stealth class with escape I.e.rogue, nothing prepared me for how brutal the ganking was.
---
Never, ever land at Chillwind point. Always had a warlock dotting and insta-killing you upon landing and no guards to protect players.
---
Don’t bother questing in EPL/WPL. Roaming gank squads hit every quest area on a 3 minute patrol.
---
Ungoro? A flight path with no guards? HA
---
Tanaris? You will be followed out of town and killed outside guard reach every time. AFK upon landing at FP? Dead in 5 seconds.
---
I have the most patient of wills and yet nothing prepares you for this. SO many of my friends with days /played quit here on pservers
---
state of this sub: mostly just memes.
---
It was fine for me, just be ready when a tremor or wotf is about to drop. Its pretty easy to outsmart most shamans/undead.
---
I think it just really fits with the type of game it is and how its played. Our gear looks mismatched because we're not finding entire sets of armor, we're looting the best junk we can find and putting it on. We're adventurers, not soldiers in uniform. It makes the experience that much more immersive.
---
I wonder if they added a disc after patches or consolidated the data?
---
Rain in winter? what..
---
People bashing ret pally only speak in terms of raids. For content outside of 40 man raids, ret has a lot more to bring to the table. A good paladin that knows to utilize his or her toolkit is a godsend. They bring powerful blessings and auras, can keep the group alive through "oh shit" moments with offheals, bubbles, keeping shit off the healer in hairy sotuations, or other utility. Basically, if shit hits the fan, that's when ret shines. There is more to classic than dps meters.
---
For instance, if you have a druid healer in your dungeon group, their only ress is a combat ress with 30 min CD. You should absolutely have another ress available, because shit happens.

Lives laden with jobs are often low on free time!
---
In most cases I wull only do them once or twice fir the quests. But there are situations when I will do sone instances more often.
---
1. There are one or more specific item/s in the instance that will be good upgrades and that will help me level out faster for a longer period of time (this only applies if I know that I have a good group to do it with)

2. As above. If I'm in a great group and the instance we are in are going smooth as a babys behindand they want to do the instance more than ones I will probably keep at it for a run or two.

Hehe, all jokes mate. See you in Classic

There is one problem with the pvp system and your advice is to simply ignore it or bail on the system all-together?

There’s nothing wrong with identifying and fixing problems like these before they arrive.

Fine. Let's make changes for PvP then. Let's make DHK's not happen in cities. Let's make DHK's only apply to quest givers. Let's make DHK's apply to ALL players less than 5 levels below your level. Let's make debuffs on players engaging in too much world PvP. Let's make...  
---
...or how about we don't worry about it too much and enjoy the game for what it is. Then we can get back to building groups/raids to hunt down the rankers and force them to quit doing what they're doing, or get their own raid to counter the raid that was built to counter them.
---
I don’t care if you have the best gear in the game! Don’t you want rewards from (classic wow) Learn to play!
---
When you finally get it tho, it’s so, so sweet.
---
I believe it was because you dropped in honour points every week! So you would lose 20% or whatever it was compared to everyone else’s progress. I never played myself but I have heard that you would lose a % of your progress once a week
---
If you dont play, your rank goes down. If you dont play enough, your rank goes down. If you dont play every god damn day, your rank goes down.
---
Because Gotham isnt in ashes yet. Once it is, then you'll have my permission to die.
---
Indeed, I mean sure you wont bring 3 ret palas as dps. But say you got a druid healer, then suddenly the ret pala  becomes a great addition due to their ability to ress.
---
To run through as fast as possible, tank 3 pure dps and a healer might be best. But for your avarage group Tank + 2 pure dps + 1 hybrid retpala/feral/shadow/ench/elemental etc + healer works just fine, and the hybrid can provide great utility and buffs, instead of say a rogue.
---
Having both played a Warrior (main) and Rogue (alt) in Vanilla. I'd say Warrior for PvE and Rogue for PvP under 'normal' circumstances. By normal I mean; sometimes you have a group, sometimes you solo, sometimes you have a dedicated healer, sometimes you don't.
---
Warriors are really dependent on a healer, especially in PvP. Rogues have a few tricks to get away. A Warrior doesn't really.
---
I always had way more fun in solo content, both PvE and PvP, on my Rogue. But damn.. when you have a healer with you on a Warrior.. best feeling in the world.
---
As a healer you'll definitively always find a spot in a PuG or even a guild raid if you're able to log in at the scheduled raid time.
---
As a tank it might be more complicated as tank need to have some gear (more than healer) to tank PuG and guild raid.
---
With these amount of hype the amount of disappointment and sadness when the nostalgia finally wears off is going be EPIC.
---
Please write another one of these when the "Oh fuck ..." kicks in.
---
I'm a bit fuzzy on it, but I'm pretty sure honor points would decay if you weren't actively gaining them every week.
---
It's complete
---
In the original system you earned Honorable Kills which gave you Contribution Points based on the rank of the player you killed. I don’t remember exact numbers, but something like 140 for a rank 1 and 300 for a rank 14. All this CP you earned was pooled into a pot together with everyone else’s on the same server and faction. Finally, 2 am before reset, Standings were calculated against other players based on your personal % contributed to the pool and Rating Points were then given based on your standing for the week. These RP gave you the ranks.
---
So that means that you must invest more time in the game than the rest, cause skill didn’t play a major time in it, just time invested. If you play 2 hours a day and everyone on the server plays 8+ you’ll never reach rank 14.
---
you could regress.  If you wanted to make it from rank 13 to 14 you basically had to be in the top 3-5 (it's based on how many people registered for PvP, but this would be a rough number) in PvP rank on the server, otherwise you lose progress.
---
Anything short of that your heading back to Rank 12, and even then you still need to be like top 50 or something to maintain progress there.  It's pretty brutal.  The best way requires everyone on the server to coordinate so you have pvp caps, but even then you will still end up playing a lot to hit those caps, they need to be high enough people not participating can't reach them.
---
take me back....
---
It looks like it, yeah. I think there's some mobs/NPCs near that farm in the 2nd screenshot and I can't see them yet. With the full Legion settings, you would see them much further out.
---
This is why "hardcore" players who are hordeside know nothing about playing hardcore WoW.  
---
Horde has always had more players, more no-lifers, and more high-school/college kids with nothing better to do than to learn coding and algorithms to improve their gameplay.  
---
Want a challenge? Roll Alliance.
---
I'll rip the secrets from your flesh
---
i played Retri only back in the days and had never problems getting in a dungeon. 
---
I would go as far as saying that you are more wanted in a ubrs 15 man or scholo or strat undead because you can really do good dmg and safe groups at rend or every other overwhelming bosses (the spot with the cages before the hound boss and the bridge, this was the time i used lay on hands on dps or tanks the most).
---
Never played a raid and my equip was not that good (Unstopable force as Weapon and mostly t0) but mostly played PvP and helped in dungeons or farming the rest of t0 (never got the boots)
---
I love these types of off-meta builds! Really creates more flavour to the game!
---
Lel, like there wont be gank squads in BRM etc. Just like in private servers, you might just have a better time if you are in the faction that has long BG ques. Because rankers will between BGs be killing everything and everyone in sight. No BG's will just make both sides suffer the same (and god forbid two ganking squads meet at burning steppes !).
---
And lets not kid ourselves, most of casual players wont even get to L60. Theres the PVE servers for people who think this is a problem. What made wow so great, that it was harsh to casuals compared to autistic players. There were a BIG difference between them. I dont really care if the servers are dwindled to 1 per region. 
---
Phase 2 isnt the endgame, its just part of the journey.
---
I have up-voted every comment of yours I can find in support of this endeavour.  
---
Also because I hate horde-side "elitest" players who think they have it hard with all of their experienced player base, greater numbers and superior racial abilities, literally making their experience in the game easy-mode compared to playing the Alliance side.
---
PvP is and always has been a very big part of WoW. Lets not pretend that in a raiding guild you cant take the time to actually rank up (even going for r14) WHILE RAIDING. Classic wow fun for me always has been that pve items can make you insanely OP in pvp but vice versa as well. I think the plan to release that gear in stage 2 is just perfect. 
---
It gives a big incentive towards world pvp and BGs later on but since only a few ppl on the server will be able to get there (I highly doubt any casual player will be able to get r10 on a contested server) i think blizz found the perfect solution.
---
I still have that picture in my head of retail vanilla when i saw the first rank 14 hunter and i was like "holy fuckin shit this guy is high warlord"   
---
The time investment it takes to get the items mentioned is definetly justified with the 1.11 versions and i do agree completely that they should be as strong as they are then.
---
Im not saying this because im a big PVP guy because im not really... but PVP is a HUGE part of classic wow, and every hardcore raider should have more than enough time to pvp all the way through
---
Are people seriously fucking arguing that we shouldn't have titles because it technically wasn't in vanilla?
---
Tbh, seeing how a Guildie (ret) somehow did more dmg than a warrior (tank), a DH and a rogue, I don't quite mind rets.
---
stupid post, we all know rets have to create their own group to get into dungeons
---
I played on a private BC server some time back. I played a warlock but I went with herb/alch over eng/tailor which is the BIS professions because of Frozen Shadoweave. I had like 100 less sp than other warlocks but I looked fly as fuck in my tier gear that nobody else could use. I also walked away with tons of gold, the ability to farm my own consumables, primal might CDs for the guild, and the dps loss honestly wasn't even that big a deal. The server wound up shutting down right as we were starting TK but I never really felt like I was a liability; warlocks are one of the strongest DPS in BC even without absolute BIS in every slot.
---
10/10 would do again.
---
I guess the point I'm trying to make is that you can still do all of the content without minmaxing things to death. You just have to be choosey about what liberties you take so that you don't sacrifice too much dps. Sometimes it's worth it to have a good time.
---
Very much so. They reduced the required exp. in multiple leveling brackets and added various quests in the world. They also worked on balancing, meaning that leveling in some cases became more efficient in general.
---
Are hunters really that bad in Vanilla? i mean i played Retri and got into groups easily ;)
---
i think most people will use the tier sets (even T0) on live then because BiS is only for the hardcore 5% or so. 
---
Look at retail, people will use the highest ilvl gear just because it has a higher ilvl
---
Aren't hunters better for nightfall? I'm serious asking
---
Rank 14 wasn't video gaming, it was a second god damn job. This is assuming you can keep your first job while reaching it. The weapons and prestige are good and cool and all, but it's just not worth it to me.
---
Totally agree! I dont really get why you're downvoted. 
---
I do not believe the "spawncamp nodespawns with several alts" on a set timer is really healthy for the game, which I'm sure Blizzard didn't intend to be the case. It's also feels really good to come across a black lotus while leveling, which really adds to the adventure and magic of the world.
---
Yup 30% iirc.
---
The view distance will be fixed to the maximum Vanilla view distance I think. (I seem to remember they mentioning it but I might be mistaken.)
---
Mob rendering distance depends entirely on the server. For both server performance and fairness reasons (you shouldn't be able to see other players before they see you) I'm pretty sure this will be unsettable and exactly the same as in Vanilla.
---
You'll be able to set ground clutter view distance.
---
I played Runescape before WoW, when I started WoW near the end of TBC as a hunter I was a clicker, leveling a rogue during WotLK I started using keybinds because clicking was no bueno for PvP as it turns out, especially on a class like rogue lmao
---
The problem is that Guild Banks (as they are used in classic and pservers) are direct violation of ToS. You are not supposed to share your account information with anybody and account sharing is a bannable offence. 
---
Making an addon that encourages or supports that behaviour is ill-advised (as far as I understand, one component of this is an actuall addon within the game client). I doubt blizzard will be happy about said addon.
---
Use a sword or mace for the human racial. Try to kill every mob that gives you exp, grind ahead of the quests. Bow pull to safe area. Buy healing pots. 
---
 It gets easier as you level up. War is worst 1v1 but one of the best for aoeing 2-4 down. Once you get sweeping strikes, whirlwind, and cleave you can start flying through quests and grinding efficiently.
---
Feral druids who are power shifting have a very particular rotation.
---
Shadow priests have a rotation.
---
Rogues have a rotation.
---
That's all the classes I know off the top of my head who have a rotation involving more than 3 buttons
---
You don't gain xp from bg in classic but you can gain xp from exploring zone and killing mob while doing Wpvp.
---
You should have explored all the zone in which you'll do Wpvp before hitting lvl 19 (ashenval, redridge,... + STV for fishing contest and arena trinket)
---
i also love transmog but they should have made it that you have more options like:
---
Just show my Transmog (you will only see your transmog)
---
Show all transmog (from other players)
---
Show none transmog
---
Show Transmog only in towns, in groups, raids or questhubs
---
This would solve all problems that comes with transmog without losing the benefits of transmog

You'll need to subscribe.
---
They're fine early on but they scale poorly with gear so by AQ/Naxx they're sub par.
---
Rogue, mage, warrior, warlock are the kings of Naxx DPS.
---
All populated PS dicrease mob/player characters render distance to handle the load on their servers. So yes, Classic demo view and render distance was better than on an average PS. But if you compare   demo draw distance with an old vanilla video, it's the same.
---
Patch 2.3  reduced XP needed from 20-60 by 30% and increased quest xp gained from 30-60 I think. It was also the patch that dungeon quests started to give extra xp over normal quests, and tons of elite quests were nerfed to just be regular mobs so you could solo them.
---
Great stuff😂
---
There were quite a few changes to the vanilla content after TBC, especially after patch 2.3. More quests, some xp brackets were reduced, they increased the density of flightpaths, most elites were removed.  
---
In the later levels you had new and improved talents, and at lvl 58 you were off to Outlands.
---
ahh okay but this will take some time till we will get aq/naxx and i think in PvP they are good aswell
---
The main reason I made this is to have an ability to share what's "inside" your bank alt to guild members without having to share your account : )
---
In vanilla only existed rank titles.
---
Depends on the stage of the game and encounter.
---
Warlocks and Mages usually dominate Naxx late game
---
but warriors and rogues can keep up too
---
I have an add-on on retail that gives me a random transmog with a button press. Good for a laugh.
---
How is it justified to give players gear several patches ahead of when they got it in blizzlike ?
---
What? Yeah it wasn't in vanilla so why should it be in vanilla? That's like saying you really like the spectral tiger mount so it might as well be in vanilla.
---
They were EARNED in vanilla. They just weren't visible until pre-patch.
---
Your analogy is shit and you're an idiot.
---
They are rebuilding the game with the original data. The team is small and I'm sure consists only of programmers.
---
This is not a "remake" like Warcraft III Reforged. They won't invest a lot of artist time and money into it. There will be no updated anything. (Except what comes free with the modern client, namely shadows and water, which will be optional.)
---
For reals!  When I got my first “epic” weapon in BfA, I had my hopes up.  Boy, was that dumb of me.  Tansmogging is fun and all, but it loses its value and luster after awhile.
---
G2G meant good to go, when the rest of the group was already at the activity.
---
Its like there is this server type designed for casuals...
---
Chill out Ret player. You're not getting a spot.
---
Yeah they remain plenty competitive in PvP
---
Ah yes, that is useful. Sorry I misread the original post.
---
I have to agree to Dwarf too. The only thing you will be getting fucked in are mirrior matchups or really good mages.. 
---
So The bleed / poison (blind) remove gives you a significant advantage in mirror fights as well as warrior rogue fights. If you are looking for strong RvM then you should pick gnome but it really doesnt give you that much of an advantage... 1 nova can be stolled out most of the time
---
Thank you!
---
You can call me an idiot all day. Catch me on my spectral tiger not listening.
---
Warrior if your tanks are good, rogue if your tanks are bad. Top position for AQ and naxx will likely be the fire mage who gets credit for ignite for that respective boss.
---
Yes the original climb to HWL or GM was brutal.  Most people have already explained a great deal in this thread. The competiotion and time expectations made it totally unrealistic for anyone not playing Wow all the time. It was more about grinding than skill also.
---
We're just preparing for TBC Classic!
---
What do you mean? We all know it's going to be July 32
---
There is another problem with those RvR fights: diminishing returns on honor gains. Each time you kill an enemy player you get 10% less honor. So after you killed someone ten times you won't be getting honor any more. There will be also a lot of players that don't reward any honor at all in TM vs. SS since their level is too low (47-).
---
If you camp a flight point in a highly frequented 50+ area with a gank squad you will have a steady stream of fresh players arriving that will most likely be lower level (48+), don't have gear and are easy kills. You could even split up your squad. Group 1 is ganking the flightpoint and group 2 is ganking the closest graveyard. While this can be excellent honor and "fun" for the gank squad they can basically shut down entire 50+ questing zones for days or weeks.  
---
I think they should release WSG either along with the honor system or delay it max 2-3 weeks.
---
Yes they are. Probably warriors too, but both of those classes can do decent dps.
---
Isn‘t it weird to denote people as assholes in a family and friends guild? Maybe I‘m interpreting too much in this term but it‘s so odd.
---
I think your underestimating the difficulty of r10. R8 is casual maybe but I imagine r9 or 10 will be 100% of your play time pvping for a couple months.
---
As you said the gear is pvp stats also, some will be bis but you will need raid gear to pve. So pvp gear might give your guild a boost progressing but you will still need to grind bwl/aq to get the rest of your bis slots.
---
Amen!
---
This is the very attitude every amerimoron brings when they travel xD you are a genuinely and uniquely asinine folk,
---
\*alliance\* \*horde\* \*alliance\* \*alliance\* Why the f a troll for disc two? Where tha gnomes at? :(
---
Paladin T2 with Lok'amir il Romathis would be dope.
---
Nihilum were not using voice com iirc :)
---
I needed someone to actually explain it like you did so that I could understand. Thank you.
---
You have the mistaken notion that ganking is "abuse".
---
Ganking *is* world PvP. (Well, yes, other things happen too. Still ganking is the vast majority of what happens on PvP servers.)
---
This is how Vanilla was designed and therefore how Classic should be. Your choices are either liking it and rolling on PvP servers or rolling on PvE and setting /pvp when you feel like.
---
This was my same point: was the only druid in the guild since day 1, I pretty much had all the gear needed for heals in just a couple of runs.
---
Obviously guildies started to roll their druids to bring into the raid, by the time they hit 60 I've started to have a quite decent feral set.
---
Then the druid patch hit us, innervate made its way into core utilities and damn, aspect of the pack was tasty.
---
We had like 3/4 druids in the raid by then, asked to get into Molten Core runs as Feral, permission obviously denied.
---
FML
---
&gt;Just. Be. Patient.
---
I've been waiting for classic WoW since WOTLK. I knew I had missed out on so much from the glory days, since I started playing after WOTLK was released. Listening to guild mates talk about the early days, holding LAN parties and wasting a whole weekend in their mothers basement with their friends just grinding mobs on WoW, I got a sort of second hand nostalgia. I've been waiting patiently, since before classic was even announced, hoping, praying that it would happen. When I finally heard the news, I felt a euphoria akin to the tipping of a million fedoras. For well over a year now, I've been patiently awaiting a release date. Then, Blizzard announced, "Summer 2019". Fantastic, I thought. But when? What day? The months rolled by, agonizingly slow. A proper date never even teased by Blizzard. I wish I could just put it out of my mind. I wish I could just go along with my life, but as the days go by, so does my patience. Every week is an eternity, every month a new disappointment. I know it will come this summer. I know that they wont dick us all up and down and postpone it. But regardless, I want, nay, I NEED to know. I need that date. I need the time to plan accordingly, as many of us working class drones do. I will not sleep soundly at night until that date is revealed. My patience has long run out. My rage is only abated by my unrelenting gratitude for Blizzards decision to re-release Classic WoW. My heart is split between hate and love. I cannot go on like this for much longer. My whole reason for being is to play Classic WoW. 
---
I have been patient. I have waited. And you dare to demand of me that I continue to be patient? Blizzard I can forgive, but you.... you I would kick in the ribs if given the chance..
---
Jk I can wait it's no big deal tbh I'm just happy it's coming out this year.
---
They’d probably been raiding together for years in eq. Wow levelling was probably considered pretty small time to them.
---
Yes! Keep them coming!
---
Shoot, I almost felt bad for the folks who spent weeks before 2.0 leveling new classes for the next expansion. Leveling an alt in TBC was eventually ridiculously easier than it was in vanilla.
---
Some items im dungons are changed also. There is more spelldamage gear avaliable earlier. 
---
Loksey Staff from SM gives 40 AP in TBC is another example. (earlier 60 AP vs beasts)
---
And patch 2.4.3 reduced the level of obtaining 60% on lvl30 btw
---
Holy shit they are so delusional. Rank 10 is achievable by casual standards but it gets very tough from there. Only the super nolifers will hit 13 and 14.
---
Your question is best for r/wowservers
---
Good luck and I hope you get it working!
---
Definitely need more quality like this!
---
omg the chat is the best part
---
"Onyxia = total joke?"
---
Well kinda, they have to gimp themselves a lot and post BWL they are already gimped enough imo. The sole hunter who still plays we usually give all the tools for dps. A ret knows he won't compete with the pure dps classes and is fine with Nightfalling while also doing decent enough dps. I still don't think it's optimal, but what the hell.. it's vanilla
---
Seriously all this Paladin hate makes me want to found a full Paladin guild
---
Blizzard are fucking war criminals
---
I read you need to be in the top 99.7% on your server or something crazy like that.
---
Waaahhh!
---
Nah  generally curious for all support roles in vanilla so thanks for replying with out being defensive! I'm all for the support classes to be honest :) , my favorite was shadow priest in TBC , I'm still tossing up what to play for vanilla (was like 56 when tbc came out so missed the vanilla phase in retail, have played a vanilla private server briefly though only as a warrior) so good to hear a good side to them, and they don't sound as boring as most people play them out to be from what I heard previously!
---
I relate too hard
---
Sexy dwarf too in there
---
The best thing about this video imo is noticing that the forced capital first letter for names wasnt in place.
---
Classic wow had an instance creation limit remember. I think it was 3 per hour max.
---
Why not for baron? This is where they can shine. UD mobs means higher dps through exorcism and holy wrath, they bring a cheap dispel for the abominations and shadow resistance aura to alleviate dmg from the Baron's aura.
---
Awesome clarificational conversation
---
Paladin is literally the worst class at keeping up the debuff of all the ones that can equip it on account of no wf, flurry, or easily spammable ability. You'd need something like at least three paladins to have the uptime of a warrior with it.
---
It takes 20 hours a day of queueing for premades. You also aren’t the only group queueing for r14.
---
What do we think the bottlenecking will be like? Would we realistically wait hours to get in, or will it be more like, 'waiting a minute, change server'?
---
oh you're right.. I was still thinking on private servers running old client...
---
well more people that play ptr and report bugs etc the faster techinilly the ptr goes live so everybody should go to ptr
---
Level to 60 fast, i mean hardcore fast, then farm valuable items and stockpile items/gold to last you months before the zerg catches up to contest the farm areas, that should let you raidlog for almost a year in even a hardcore guild.
---
Unless u are a rogue hunter priest or prot war
---
Shaman/pala during nax
---
Yeah I think WoW has some of the most beautiful zones of any game I've played. It's why I strongly want old graphics (toggled if necessary). 
---
I don't think realism in video games works. Something will always be "off". But games that never try for realism, that have their own art style and acknowledge it - somehow they're not jarring? I think it was one of the things GW2 did right. They went for an artistic, painterly effect.
---
would be great if people kept in mind that it's an rpg not farmville
---
and it was made in LoTR movie time (2003)
---
Good thing outside raids all those casters have an incredibly complex toolkit for pvp and farming via aoe or otherwise that's really fun to play. Meanwhile even in the good part of the game ret is still pretty much an auto attack class outside of organized groups.
---
Depends. If your second profession doesnt require them, or you dont have any alts with a profession that requires them, then selling them is a no-brainer. It also depends on which mats specifically. If it's something you no longer need for your second profession (i.e. you leveled past needing it) and you still have a bunch then you should just sell them. You only keep what you need or might need in the near future.
---
here you see the exact leveling tree step by step.
---
https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm
---
this is considered the best leveling spec. personally i like to swich to hemo spec at lvl 30. (looks like that with lvl 51: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMe0oxZZxMeochRo)
---
2-5 are the worst
---
I prefer to bind keys fairly the same for every Class, for example:
---
For healers Q is always my instant heal   
---
For everyone else Q is my interrupt. If a class has 2 interrupts I use shift Q for the 2nd. E is my stun (if available)
---
As for generall keybinds i only use 1-5 QERF. YXC for longer cooldowns since you don't use them that often. I bound the other spells to shift versions of those or clicked if there were too many. (shaman totems)
---
You can create your own system within keybinds. 
---
I never used key turning because my friends told me, as I started playing I should never use this, so I did. 
---
DISCLAIMER: I started playing in TBC and never raided until WotLK, so downranking spells was not that important (as much as I know) so you don't have that many spells in your bar.
---
I did it as resto on a boss in Zul'Aman, moonfire spammed and got the KB as the last one alive :)

---
because back in the day there was no balance with those things. the amount of time you had to put in to get the pvp gear was nowhere NEAR justified. So they adjusted it with 1.11 and im fully convinced thats a perfect fit for classic wow in general
---
Im not reading this.
---
Vanilla: No Pvp --&gt; Pvp system --&gt; Battlegrounds
---
That's just the way it is.
---
Running your own company also means: not doing work not making money. Which is kinda difficult to combine with WoW, something I'm strugglin with.
---
Smart guy. Im not addicted it's for science, babe.
---
You say no changes but we already are getting the 1.12 verison.  So what you are suggesting would be a change. 
---
Peoples mentality has changed, even if they did use an earlier version of AV people would still rush to the end because they realized that is the fastest honor per hour method. 
---
Even on pservers that used the OG days long version people still did this same exact thing.
---
Very cute! Well done :)
---
Nice
---
TBH, I didnt really mind long AVs. If you wanted to play a shot one, you'd just go do WSG or AB
---
its not really worth to grind it. the most efficient way is to do a dungeon once when u have all (almost all) quests. u cant save the amount of time spent farming it with faster kill speed. 
---
but of course you can do it if u want. could be fun ;)
---
I'll just wait for the next day.
---
With PvE, you're usually stuck using your normal rotation of spells/attacks, the ones that do the most damage/healing, which is usually all you'll ever need to finish a dungeon or raid. In PvP, it's a good idea to know all of your classes abilities and how they should be used, so you can adapt on the fly to any situation. 
---
I'm garbage at PvP, because I dont know what half my abilities do, and usually I'm specced for PvE optimization anyway. I'm great at PvE, but tbh being a DPS ain't rocket surgery. Adapting in PvE situations is easy, because there's a lot less variables when fighting NPC's. Player characters can think on the fly, and that makes them potentially more dangerous (unless they suck, like me). 
---
In the end, it really is just practice, and actually learning from your mistakes rather than just respawning at the graveyard in a BG and rushing in and doing the exact same thing that got you killed moments ago.
---
It wasn't just my bracket though, every 5 minutes I checked a /who basin and /who gulch and nobody was there, not even lvl60s.
---
It actually makes sense. At the end of vanilla you are fighting old gods and lords of elemental planes.
---
Then your story continues, venture to Outland, fight Arthas, etc etc.
---
At some point you should be referred as somebody exceptional and not just a random traveller.
---
Tru dat
---
There's a large gray area between "hardcore world first pushers" and "casual group \[that has 18 off specs that is going to take 14 hours to clear MC\]".
---
They’ve done a good job of of giving players what looks to be the real classic experience, I don’t think it’ll be realistic enough without 5 hour long server queues.
---
Serious talk though, i can understand not letting ret pallies into raids but they arent THAT bad that ppl would shun them aswell for 5 man content?
---
Yeeeah! Classic ankh boss kill haha
---
Earn r10 is rather easy nowadays, 95% can do it with reasonable effort. Decay starts to be pain past r10. So I aggree that buffed blue set is bigger issue than epic set. On the other hand we will "unbuffed" blue set and 1.11 epic set, the gap between these two will be huge, you will not stand a chance against anyone with r12, 13 gear...blizz should reconcider this decision
---
&gt;The current alliance/horde heroes are fighting a war amongst each other.
---
Not in vanilla. In vanilla there is a cold war going on between Horde and Alliance. There are some territorial disputes, some proxy wars but nothing major. There is a fragile peace between the two factions.
---
Does this also mean there can only be 1 rank 14 for each faction each week? I remember it like that, could be wrong though
---
It's more about Serpent Sting not scaling that much(at all) with your gear, compare to auto shots/multishot etc.
---
How did does 5he Norwegian winter feel for you?
---
A guild could be a bigger construct. So if there are family and friends does not make everyone in that guild friends. There could have been probably people in there that didn't know each other before.
---
And being family or friend does not make you not an asshole.  
---
You could be one of my best friends and still be an asshole in the view of another human being.
---
cool
---
i would be sad and angry
---
Yes
---
no.
---
I did it during summer break in my teens. I did not sleep for 2 months
---
Imagine a cute little lvl 19 just trying to fish in STV and getting destroyed by every rogue on the server.
---
Plate DPS item - good one :-D there are like three I could think off...girdle, chromaggus boots and skeram chest...rest is brawl with rogues and hunter :-D
---
This sub has a hard on for ret paladins.
---
This was one change I didn't mind.
---
Hah. Go for it. Enjoy being in MC for 16 hours.
---
15666 how is your sex life?
---
Potentially true, potentially not.
---
You only need to play as much as the too honor farmers.   So if everyone only does PvP 2 hrs a day, that's all you need.
---
Blizzard did make the mechanics that made it hard, but the playerbase made it hell.
---
Pretty much this you would lose 20% after every week and you would need more the higher you climbed so 20% of 1000 at a low rank is only 200 points where as near the top I think 20% of 50000 would be 10000 points you lost lol if you didn’t play every day and not only that but do better every day so you don’t stagnate you won’t get to rank 14
---
Couldn't agree more. I remember feeling sad when moving on from a zone into a new one because they all felt so immersive and fun to be in. Then the next zone would just capture the imagination in the same way.
---
No not really...
---
&gt; People are just gonna hit exalted in 2-3 weeks get the rewards and just que WSG and AB/fps
---
Why do people bring this up like it'll be any different with the 1.5 AV. It won't.
---
Scholomance for me.
---
Europe invented America. Remember that.

Good luck! Just don't spend all your time in Azeroth! :P

The plague quest in the Brill in where it takes the NPC about 2 minutes to respawn each time you give it the potion and it dies.............
---
As a ret paladin main I plan on making my own groups, and letting any and all specs in.
---
So you want to be mercilessly farmed in level 46+ zones for months?
---
You could earn bloodsail admiral too. There wasnt an option to change your title from you pvp rank until tbc.
---
Every week your honor points are converted into Ranking Points ( RP ) and added to your total RP. You need 60000 Ranking Points for Rank 14 (55000 for Rank 13), but absolute maximum a player can earn per week is 13000 RP. 
---
Every week Your total RP will naturally decay by 20%. For exampple, if You are Rank 13 (You have earned 55000 RP), You'll lose 11000 RP  to decay during the next server maintenance. This means that, even theoretically, you can't achieve Rank 14 if you earn less than 12000 RP per week because at some point Decay will be greater than RP you earned.

Article on WoWWiki https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0)
---
What sort of items would you stockpile?
---
Burning steppes and searing gorge is pretty much a BG on pvp servers and I can see it getting completely out of hand with some guilds in Classic. A phase 2.1 WSG release would help mitigate the worst of the merciless low lvl hunting. 
---
But don't forget that alot of players want to have that raw unpolished world pvp experience atleast once. It is a big attaction too. 
---
In phase 2 of this other server I was able to deal with the merciless hunting by having freinds and traveling in packs of 5. Already being 60 with a few epics just made it fun really. 
---
I think phase 2 without WSG lasting for months would be a big mistake though. All the new lvl 48-59 got it rough in that time.
---
UBRS is designed a 10-man instance, so all the quests were raid quests. Otherwise either no one could complete them or you could only complete them if you were far overgeared and could run the place with half of the designed player group.
---
MANY WHELPS
---
LEFT SIDE
---
Wasn't classic back in the day the first very casual friendly mmo? Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
1 - The pservers don't have all those links quite right. It's been years since vanilla, but I think most of the things you could link in chat worked for others to view.  
---
2 - Auctioneer was a huge part of vanilla. Mods for this drove a massive economy, and was a huge part of the game, for everyone. Blizzard saved a TON of valuable dev time by focusing on content and patches to repair bugs instead of wasting time on things like this.  
---
3 - You could get mods for this, and was one less thing the servers had to provide you. Also, some mods like Auctioneer could provide probably DE values for items as well.  
---
4 - De-mounting was one of those things that could put into a keybind/macro, if I recall.  
---
5 - Hearthstones were a valuable commodity, but there were a lot of ways people would get around the long cooldowns (dropping group in dungeons, using the "stuck" help ticket). I wouldn't mind that being a little tougher, actually. Make sure people go places with a purpose, rather than mindlessly wandering around, hoping to gank some random player and run off again... but that's just me  
---
6 - Questing was a wonderful part of Vanilla. I understand your frustration there, but seems like something I would actually prefer over the 25 list, only because I like the idea of forcing a bit more "intentionality" into a person's gameplay. I don't want to simply run off and quest somewhere else, thinking "I'll come back later" - instead, I want to pause, find another player, and find a way to win.  
---
These were things that made WoW great, and these are some of the reasons why I think they were fine the way they were - but that's just my opinion. =)
---
If it was like back in the day, R9 and upwards becomes a drag and getting worse with each additional rank. I grouped up with a warrior and a few other people back then before BGs were out and we grinded the plague lands for hours and hours every day. I reached R9 in a fairly decent amount of time, but my Warrior buddy wanted to go all the way, which is when our paths separated, he spent literally all day grinding for honor for weeks to rise the ranks and I stopped, because it was just too much time investment for me.
---
I believe people imagine every second person to be running around with the high rank PVP rewards as soon as the honor system is released, but if I see someone with R14 gear, he has earned it with his time and blood more so than any regular raiding person could earn it.
---
Now the 1.12 versions might be a bit of a stretch at that point in time of the game, but even so ... A R14 player that early in Vanilla was literally a no-lifer that I would respect for the dedication they put in or an account-sharer.
---
I wont disclose any items or farm locations i have in mind for myself for obvious reasons, just do some research on what items should be in high demand both short term and long term for raiding consumables in different raid tiers etc, some things might be sold early for 50s-2g due to server economy, but some of that stuff will be worth 5-10g later down the line when its in higher demand.
---
Feel about what? Another question being asked with an obvious answer? It's getting old.
---
Im also in that mind, I dont want to support Blizzard anymore with the whole spying on your baby, Banning the OK hand gesture, Banning people in game for what they do outside of the game, Shutting down HOTS literal weeks after saying everything is fine to their casters and players, The direction retail is going, Diablo immortal etc etc etc. 
---
But I really enjoy wow...
---
I was thinking about farming Black Lotus as long as noone farms it.
---
This is exactly how PvP servers worked in Vanilla and we managed just fine.
---
If you can't deal with that, play on a PvE server.
---
There's also a fairly big difference from 58-60 since you could go and level in Outland which was a lot faster.
---
We already did include RP-PvP. It'll be in the third census, too.
---
I'm going to go ahead and assume that the number of loser NEETs on any particulsr server will be low enough that it will be a nuisance, rather than a game breaking oversight by blizzard.
---
Just how many unwashed, neckbearded virgins do you think are waiting to prey on flight paths?
---
Do a hunter one with dragon stalker helm and double ashjrethrul bow, or ashkandi.
---
&gt; But they should be prepared for a Phase 2.5 with just WSG if things get too out of hand too quickly. I think phase length will dictate a lot of this and until we have that info, it’s tough to say what is and isn’t the right choice. Good post.
---
I think this is the best compromise, upvoted in the hope this gets attention.
---
I agree, and think they should basically have WSG ready immediately and hold onto it "just in case".
---
They could launch Phase 2, and then add WSG within 2 weeks or something, if the open world on PVP servers becomes a toxic mess.
---
You are correct, Huntards, trailerpark Rogues and the like are of course going to be playing the game and I've met many of them back in the day. I just wouldn't group up with them do to things or invite them to our guild / raids.
---
Do you think that the desire to raid often has changed all that much? I mean sure, you run out of content if you clear things in an hour or two, but other than that? My server had hundreds of people raiding actively multiple times a week and 4 hours per day. I wonder how things are going to look like now well over a decade later.
---
is it possible to share these quests which arent chains?? i want to quest in Silverpine Forest  so it will be long trip to take for example quests for rfc
---
Truth be told: noone will be able to tell you how people these days will fare with classic. What kind of standards they may or may not apply. 
---
Back in original Vanilla people didn't mind. People chose to play with people they could talk to. People chose to play with those that enriched their time in voice-tools and in questing and everything. Druids were fine, we always had multiple back in our raid compositions. 
---
You will most certainly have a harder time if you are to go for the top guilds of the server but if you're fine being in the mid-field then you'll enjoy your time as a druid. Depending on your precise specc you'll be a trick of trades. You can do everything but you'll be a master of none. AND IN CLASSIC, THIS WORKS JUST FINE!!!
---
I, myself, will go with a tank druid and won't let anyone talk into this. Some guilds won't take me, but some others will and I'll enjoy the time with a character I feel comfortable with.
---
The most stupid thing you can do in vanilla is hold on to a bunch of gold and buy consumes on the AH on a weekly basis, shits expensive when its in season, both for pve and pvp
---
There is a thread in r/classicwow called LFG Monday, GMs advertise guilds there
---
Which is the 0.01% in this case? I don't really know what you are asking for here.
---
Yeah the exp required was reduced and I think every mob was made 30% weaker? Something like that.
---
Played on Vashj as well as an ret paladin... life was hard back then, god damn I wish I could remember that one UD rogue with TF... Eyetoyo maybe?
---
Drops?
---
Oh yes, I remember. &lt;3
---
Position in Queue: 2300 
---
Estimated Time: 300 minutes
---
And finally, when you were able to log in, the server crashed 5 minutes later and you went back to the queues.
---
The terms of service is different in the current day and you are likely banned for good if you corpsecamp or prevent usage of flight paths. Just something to think about.
---
And basically, to earn 12k rp, you need to be in the top 0.2% of your faction, and 13k rp, only for the first one.
---
So yes, very competitive as you need to be the biggest player
---
Yes but if you are a hardcore player and you have some IRL friends which would like to play with you, they will play on the same server :P
---
Also Blizz doesn't tell you in the login screen that PVP Servers are for Vietnam Veterans.
---
I have a feeling that’s it’s mainly 1 asshole telling his friends and family how to play...
---
First off dont consider difficulty in your decision. You will have a long time to learn as you level and tbh nothing in wow is really difficult it's just a learning process.
---
For pvp: druids are hard to kill, they are great at escaping but are subpar rogue war and other healers straight up. Very fun pvp class thou cuz unsheepable, unrootable, stealth, root, and travel form.
---
Shams are glass canons if enh or ele, very fun but I dont consider them a good pvp class like mage rog or hunter. Resto sham on the other hand is godly 1v1er. They die easily in group pvp but the windfury and purge make them must haves. They also get 45% ghost wolf with rank6 boots.
---
For pve: druid will get teir gear very fast as you only have 2-3 druids in the raid. They are tank healers, they can swap to bear if get aggroed, they can give mana, and they can res in battle which is arguably more useful than ooc res, and they get 2 instant heals as well as heal over time.
---
Sham are more versatile healers, they usually aoe heal the raid while priest/dru focuses tanks. They carry multiple gear sets healing power vs mana regen for different fights. They have the highest healing per second output when in t2.5 and the best mana preservation when in t1 of any healer (more healing per mana than t3 set). They can purge, they drop 1-3 totems every fight and must pay attention on redropping them, they can combat ress themselves, they can also give their group mana. 
---
For enh, ele, feral dps, boomkin spec I wouldn't reccomend raidin. You would have more fun rolling a proper caster or melee if that's your goal.  
---
In the end they are both fun to play. I enjoyed shaman more but I played it longer and never tried feral druid tanking or boomkin pvp which both look super fun ^^
---
Or maybe for the classic crusade?
---
I’m hoping for phasing in the first couple of weeks in the low level zones to help out with the load of players. It will basically be unplayable with 2000 or so people all about 6 areas with blizzard spawn rates (not ptr inflates ones). You would literally take 30 minutes to do 1 quest.
---
Apsolutly this, cant agree more. Well said op.
---
100% agree with you. The big servers will be destroyed by the hardcore that race to 60 and camp the fuck out of 49-60 zones.
---
I'm actually looking forward to sitting in the queue and watching it slowly go down whilst sweating and shaking.
---
Asscrack
---
PST? I never came around that in vanilla?
---
They confirmed they wouldn't add Classic transmog/mounts to your *retail* account?
---
They can have no wardrobe/toys/etc. on Classic, but still track what you've picked up.
---
They just need to take notes from OSRS.
---
Haha kind of fair enough
---
&gt; July 16th Classic releases. Players want to return to WoW but need to pay the sub fee because 8.2 came out just a little over a month earlier and their sub has run out.
---
Hmmm business-minded enough to be plausible.
---
Never played druid, why couldnt you use potions again?
---
What cost would a phase 2.1 WSG be to you?
---
you can also do this when classic comes out june.
---
I got vacation in august so it would be perfect for me but also that would mean the longest wait and thats not perfect for me :(
---
No
---
Nothing beats vanilla atmosphere and enviroment but i have always thought highly of TBC's zones, for me in all of the expansions, levelling through TBC was the most memorable cuz of the beautiful zones and music.
---
&gt; I think the blue posts we've been getting (about the improvements to the game) have pushed the window back. (In a good way.) More phases, itemization gating, etc -- means more development &amp; QA. (And I'm glad it does. I want classic to be a fantastic.)
---
Surely this is the opposite logic?
---
If they've given themselves more defined targets/phases, and also these phases segregate the content into smaller (but more numerous) slices, this should mean they can release *earlier*.
---
They now have less work to do, and a clearer objective, for Phase 1. And then have a ~3 month development-cushion before Phase 2.
---
Intelligence is a pretty useless stat for warrior but it increase the speed at which you gain weapon skill, ask mage to buff you when you see one
---
I dont see situation where turning with A/D is ever useful
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley
---
**Uncanny valley**
---
In aesthetics, the uncanny valley is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object. The concept of the uncanny valley suggests humanoid objects which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit uncanny, or strangely familiar, feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers. Valley denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness.Examples can be found in robotics, 3D computer animations, and lifelike dolls among others.  With the increasing prevalence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation, the 'valley' has been cited in the popular press in reaction to the verisimilitude of the creation as it approaches indistinguishability from reality.

Git gud. Change zones, redridge is one if the favorite ganking zones, go level somewhere else.
---
Purple lotus, firebloom, grave moss, larva acid and that fire stuff used in Cenarion LW bracers (DE into large brilliant shard). Also if content progression will have leaks then plants/elemental stuff used for Argent Dawn turn in, Silithus cultist gear, notes or at the very least things your faction needs to turn in for the War Effort.
---
How would a bear take the lid off 🙄
---
#NoChangesButYesIWantPvpGearToBeOverpowered
---
I think what killed it is all the scenery was rendered pointless in retail, like... Wow! look at that enormous expanse highland/plains/forest... Imma teleport over the whole thing **BING**.
---
Elemental fire and devilosaur leather I 2 obvious thing to farm also if you are a herbalist go for mana pot ingredients. And you can always farm crusader recipe/arcane orbs
---
Like I said, R8 is definitely obtainable as casual.
---
Such a badass look when paired with the tabard of scarlet crusade too
---
they pretty much have no utility that a holy pala can bring.
---
Hammer of Wrath under 20% mob health makes your fourth move against undeads :-)
---
Is it worthy to take time to run a dungeon, make friend and gain good gear? well yes?
---
Ya just to give an idea I got r8 on nostalrius grinding 300k honor per week with mind to get r10 but first week into r8 I realized 300k honor wasn't enough to progress and if I didnt get at least 300k I'd lose progresses and even derank. That was about 3 hours a day 7days a week. R14 you need multiple people playing 1 char 24/7 I assume.
---
In short, ranking is based on a hidden point system. Every week you decay 20% of your current points, then whatever you gained is added.
---
In order to progress from higher ranks, you need more and more points per week. The amount of points you get is based on how much honor you get COMPARED to your own faction. Basically in order to progress at high ranks you need to be top 1-20(exact number based on how many is playing on your faction) of your faction in nolifing honor, and pvp is highly competitive. And not only do you have to basically grind more than everyone else, you have to maintain it for a long time. From scratch, it takes 12 weeks of being #1 on your faction to get r14.
---
Guild Wars 2 can get some hate from the people who dont like newer gen MMOs but its the only other mmo other than wow that really captures me in the world. These two games are the only two I catch myself not solely relying on the map to get around because I remember the world so well because its so fucking cool. These are the only 2 games I get sidetracked from my goal just adventuring around finding cool things and the zones really come alive because of it. In wow its finding those weird quests in random spots and guild wars its map events/completion which in effect is basically just quests but GW2's take on that
---
We can do damage for while! Then it's back to SW:P lvl 1 to proc Shadow Weaving.
---
That's as much as I remember, maybe some better players have figured something out.
---
with 1.5 it might take longer :D
---
I think there is undoubtely a place for very realistic, detailed, high end graphics in video games. But its far from being a necessity.
---
Yup, you will die, run, ress, kill 1-2 mobs and they're back already, you die, run, wait for timer, ress, kill 1-2 mobs, rinse and repeat.
---
My most recent private server character had the longest /played to 60 of all my characters. Let that sink in. 16 year old me had less playtime on his first 60 than I did now on my 10th warrior. It was brutal and relentless and I hope I never will experience it again.
---
I looked like shit in vanilla until raids (and even then it was always horrible combinations) but damn if i dont look forward to actually seing someone with a certain weapon and knowing its that weapon they use aswell.
---
Transmog, although a cool feature, completely ruined the feeling of seing another player with some sick gear.
---
in early server game no one will need it.   Plus I heard that there will be some Chinese/lvl one players will spawn in the locations to take it.  And it's a big commitment to herbelism, which isn't too easy to level with your troon
---
Dude that’s hundreds/thousands of hours of work.  
---
Would you not rather play this summer?
---
Much appreciated
---
Use your imagination a bit what can a guild full of Pserver Rank 14's do to a server during phase 2? What can 2 or 3 guilds like that do? These guilds exsist and they are bringing thier A+ game for classic. 
---
Want to be world first R14? Lock down BRM no one can enter or exit without dieing 5 times. Maybe not quite that bad but for sure it will get out of hand on some servers. 
---
What cost is an early Phase 2.1 WSG to you?
---
Elemental fire and devilsaur(if possible) is definitely very good.
---
In a developer q&amp;a they confirmed that they would keep the games separate and never grant achievements/mounts because it would be unfair to people who got it in vanilla
---
And there was added quests, specifically dushwallow marsh was turned into an amazing leveling zone for both ally and horde.
---
Yeah, when random green shit was better than my Plageheart set I though F this, I'm out... and I was; haven't played since TBC.
---
1. I agree
---
2. I agree
---
3. Why not but there are addons for that
---
4. A simple macro will do the work
---
5. No
---
6. Just do the quests in your log
---
Apologies, misread that as r10.
---
Cant complain, I guess but I didn't enjoy it. The cold isnt the worst, it's the perpetual darkness. I lived on the coast (Bergen) so we dont get the extreme sub zero temps but the darkness makes Society different for 8 months out of the year.
---
we had em towards the end of vanilla.
---
Just turn your graphics to lowest when playing retail. My 2018 $3K Macbook Pro can barely pull that off and the trees looks like garbage, if that's what gets you hard.
---
There's a folder called "WDB" it saves item stats and looks, basically stuff like this.
---
If you delete it, then you basically reset it and you will see whatever version the server runs on.
---
1. great post, well thought out and very good wording
---
2. impressive how you are defending your post with good arguments in your responses
---
3. I wish I could articulate myself like that without getting personal lol
---
4. Did I say great post already?
---
Na mate they are the second best because they get double procs. And a warrior has to seriously gimp himself while using a nightfall. A paladin will outdps both arms and fury warriors with Nightfall because it's a shit weapon for them. So I'd rather have one of the paladins doing bad dps but still buffing the raid with blessings and Nightfall than a warrior doing really poor dps and only buffing with a NF with lower uptime than the paladin. 
---
Also that warrior will be fucking miserable because he knows he can do serious dps but is forcing to wield an axe that nerfs him into the ground. A retri knows and accepts that he won't compete in the meters.
---
Are you sure it's only 0.01%
---
You need to have more honor than everyone else in your faction in your server to get the max points for a few weeks straight, just to get from rank 13 to rank 14. 
---
If you dont, and someone else has more honor than you, it means you wont get the first place in the rank points for that week. And second place in rank points means a lot less than rank 1. For rank points you can think of them as tiers, tier one only fits one person, he will get 5000 points, tier two has two people, they get 4000, tier 3 hast 6, and they get 3000, almost half of what the top one got.
---
Then you lose a shit ton of rank each week, the more the higher you are, so to go past rank 12 or so, you need to end up in top 5. If you dont, you just lose ranks, until you end at a stage where you earn enough to keep up with the decay.
---
So in the end, you dont need to play too much. Just get more honor every week than the second highest player. This is why it is so damn hard to go for r14.
---
Ah, fair enough.
---
&gt;Respawns were definitely dynamic, although I don't know exactly how they worked obviously.
---
Even IF this is true, there's a system for the spawns, people can figure it out and camp it no less, unless if it's a completely random spawn timer like 10min-2hours, but that's very unlikely.
---
Please add more detail in why you think it was dynamic.
---
By early on, he means at the start of a server economy. Not levels
---
will maybe need to search for each quest on wowhead, but i think nearly all if not all of the non chain quests are shareable.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5723/testing-an-enemys-strength
---
Oh naive starry eyed child, never underestimate the amount of autists in World of Warcraft.
---
Both your suggestions suck. #nochanges
---
It's important to note the differences between texture view distance and mob rendering. 
---
One thing is just looks, if your PC can handle it, then I don't see why it would be possible to turn it up to 11. 
---
However for mob rendering. Not only because it impacts server, but it is actually a very important thing in PVP that you cannot see 500 yards ahead. It makes abilities like Eagle eye unique, and it's very important you can't see that far because of the implications in BG's and world pvp. Especially something like world bosses, imagine if you could see a whole raid coming 1 minute away.

---
&gt; Competing with Rouges for most armor and Warriors for Weapons, two of the most common classes
---
 You only compete with rouges for armor when going cat DPS (and then you compete with warriors as well btw) not when going tank. You don't compete for weapons with anybody in bear and rarely when cat, since for a druid weapon dps does not matter, weapons are just stat sticks.
---
&gt; Less supportive than Shaman
---
That one is true.
---
&gt; Most likely not going to tank/dps in raids later on.
---
That is only up to you.
---
&gt;No non-combat res
---
Never missed it to be honest. I take brez over regular rez any day.
---
&gt;While able to do good DPS, you probably aren't beating Warriors, Rouges (who compete for the same gear), and Mages.
---
You won't. But why dps? You can tank.
---
Farm m+ and arenas on retail and all that will be a breezr

---
It's maybe a bit exaggerated but I'd say close. Not many will rush to get "first".
---
Feral dps/tank: There's a fair bit of proof that feral dps/tank can do fairly well if you care enough to farm a mace in gnomergan over and over again. It might not be completely better than warrior at the very highest level, but I'd say it's close enough.
---
Resto has a bit of a problem that is HoT's don't stack. So one of the important parts of resto is keeping the tank hotted but because only 1 druid can do that, it's rather common for guilds only to have 1 druid. Though TBF later in the game druids can pump out some amazing healing. With that said, it's not actually that hard to find a guild as druid, mainly because they are very underplayed. 
---
Pvp: For BG's you are pretty much right. They are amazing FC's in WSG and that's what you will be doing there, in AB they are kinda meh but if you wanna pvp seriously then premades don't have an issue inviting you for AB as long as you carry them later in WSG :D
---
As for worldpvp, there's some pretty damn amazing things that a good druid can do. Druid is most certainly NOT the worst 1v1 class.
---
One thing to consider is that it's always been possible to increase the view distance past the UI's parameters by adjusting the values in the config file yourself.
---
Casual friendly as you could log in and know nothing of MMO's, the quests were planned to move you around the map in ~reasonably efficient ways. Tooltips explained what skills do etc. 
---
So starting out was easy. But in endgame the ppl that raided were from different planet in gear (tank/dps/heal) compared to others. Sitting in a capital city in Tier 1 or Tier 2 you would constantly be inspected by lower level players that never even knew such items existed.
---
I’m doing my part!
---
Yeah, I didn't actually play much GW2, just ran around exploring everything. I was lucky enough not to have followed it super-closely, so I didn't know about their designed exploration stuff. So the first time I came across an interesting looking hole I thought "what the heck, let's jump" and ended up in this whole underground maze zone, having to figure out how to navigate in the dark and stuff. Turned out there was a torch I could have used, but I didn't spot it, so was using one of my spells with a really bright effect to temporarily light the way ahead, and then jumping into the dark. It was awesome. Of course then I went and googled and found all those points were described online, with guides. It's that sort of thing I wish they had kept out of the beta. It's not core to the game, so if it had been broken it wouldn't really have mattered. And they could have kept everyone guessing for years whether or not we'd really found all of them.
---
This is why sensible people roll PvE, none of this elitist carebear bullshit. When Classic first launched, I played PvE for 2 years without evening realising the difference. If I want to PvP I can go to a battleground, if I want to PvE I can do it in peace. Life was great.
---
Now I've rolled on a pserver where the only choice was PvP, didn't think much of it. Except as soon as you leave Westfall, you're basically corpse walking 50% of your time online because some shitstain bored level 60 is camping you. This is the same for pretty much every zone I've been in. It is not fun or enjoyable. 
---
First time round, people didn't know or care about min maxing or being general dickheads. For whatever reason, gaming and attitudes have changed since then, whereas in the old days it was frowned upon to corpse camp someone 10-40 levels below you, these days it's "lul git gud skrub". And if people already know the best and most efficient way to do something before it's released.. it kinda breaks the whole pure open world glorious warcraft vibe you're all going for. 
---
I only get an hour or two each night if I'm lucky to play.. do I want to spend that ghost walking back to my corpse while some fully decked out basement dweller is one shotting me? Nope. 
---
I'm sure the hardcore 12+ hours a day basement dwellers will get their kicks on PvP servers, but anyone who doesn't have the time and effort to invest in levelling to 60 within 2-3 weeks of launch (majority of playwers, minority of this subreddit) should really just roll PvE. Maybe in 6 months or a year after launch when things have calmed down then go for PvP alt.
---
And for all the people like "ohh ye questing should be hard, levelling should be miserable and difficult and you should suck it up being corpse camped or hitting 60 means nothing" that is a dreadful attitude to have because no doubt YOU will never have experienced that since you will be racing to 60 putting in 16 hour days as part of a guild formed years ago. /smh. The whole PvP &gt; PvE thing really screams micropenis and it's kinda offputting in this subreddit to see these retarded arguments playing out over and over. Each to their own right? No point belittling someone because they don't enjoy being corpse camped repeatedly.
---
I'd recommend mining + engi yes. And then you can sort of make a decision later whether you wanna stick with mining or go blacksmithing. I think you should find a guild though before you make that decision, and there's no rush to leveling blacksmithing at all, go finish mining and get some arcane crystals!
---
Have an upvote to counteract the bad karma from everyone who missed the /s
---
This must happen.
---
There will be rankers on every server. They will take the path of least resistance which will make the open world hell for anyone 48+
---
I know you say casuals should play pve but come on... I like the odd skirmish but the current plan will take it too far!
---
As it should be. Phasing isn’t needed.
---
That's not really what I feel. I feel it's more like a theme part vs an adventure world. Modern WoW is full of flashy graphics and features that they like to show off to their players and leading them by the hand. While in vanilla the feeling is much more that you are thrust into a huge world with some water, apples and a good luck. 
---
Even though I've by now thoroughly explored every square meter of the world, I still feel like an adventurer. 
---
But it's not because I don't enjoy a theme park ride sometimes, I just feel that other games do the theme park style better. Games like Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm (or any other MOBA) where you are shown the options for what you can do, choose one and off you go. It works brilliantly in those games, but a stage select screen in an MMO just feels wrong.

Go play retail

Or you can just not roll on a PvP server

There's actually a mechanical loss to gameplay by binding strafe to a and d, to do with hit boxes, and server response but I've been down voted to hell when trying to explain it in the past.

I've always kept a and d as is and its given me advantages throughout the game.

The Blackrock Spire dungeon has two path, UBRS and LBRS. Both are in the same dungeon. The quests in UBRS are raid quests and can be completed in a raid. The quests in LBRS are dungeon quests and can't be completed in a raid.

Good point but what do you say to this time line?
---
Classic: No Pvp ------&gt; Pvp system ---&gt; Battlegrounds
---
        many months --&gt; 48-72 hours --&gt; WSG 
---
There is bound to be some servers with guilds going hardcore enough to break the whole damn server. I feel like early WSG would not cost much in terms of the Authentic Vanilla experince.

Did you play on lightnings blade too?

Can you explain? I promise I won't downvote.

I know the feel. I come from Narvik but live in southern sweden now. It is night and day!
---
I dont really care about stage 2, i like the vanilla way as it was (but maybe this time getting more than 0.1fps in taren mill would be nice). Going to get ganked going into instances, what ever. Its part of the games evolution, ofc im going to be L60 and raiding at that stage. Or more likely leveling an grind mage alt. And you can do that inside a instance, so keep on camping the doors all day, every day.
---
Thats preposterous!
---
There is a problem here whit ppl raiding cities. Now don't get me wrong there is still a high chance of dishonorable kills in a city raid. But if all you had to do was log in on a low level char and force dishonorable kills on the raid that would be a problem
---
&gt;playing games on a macbook

There's your first mistake

Not sure if it was used the same way as today tho. Meaning the whole 40 man raid having one and pop it at 29%. 120 helpers soaking ALL of the damage.

I did. Getting full plate armor was amazing. Was it wise? Uhh, probably not.

Nah dude, fuck that shit! NO CHANGES! When classic comes out, I'm moving back into my parent's house, grabbing my old Dell &amp; 15"CRT monitor from out their attic so that I can play on that glorious 1024×768 resolution. I'm getting my old computer chair, which really was a dining chair with a pillow taped to it. I'm canceling their 80/80 fiber and getting that good ol' 5/1 ADSL that fucks your whole shit up whenever somebody calls the landline. I'm even gonna start hanging around on my old middle school, just to make the experience 100% authentic.
---
The older I get, the more I prefer "crappy" graphics to AAA 3d ones. I tend to play 2D sprite based games way more, for exactly the reasons you mentioned - imagination. The more realistic graphics get, the less opportunity for imagination, the less involved you feel.
---
It's like this: you won't encounter enough nodes while questing to make much of anything. You'll actually have to dedicate real time to gathering while leveling. Then theres the issue of what you make is generally garbage, unless you get really unlucky with drops by the time you are high enough level to craft the item you'll be wearing better (an example of this is the green iron set. Iron spawns in level 30ish zones but the gear is for level 20-30s). Weapons are categorically bad, requiring rare items and are barely fit for purpose, unless twinking an alt. 
---
My suggestion is to pick up mining and hit nodes as you quest but just stockpile the stuff until you hit 60 and then start in on the crafting.
---
Nahh, the sooner the better. There will be plenty of time for both
---
You have my sword and my axe and my bow! Made me laugh, thanks.
---
I remember playing against Death and Taxes while horde on Shattered Hand. They were always ahead of the curve and one of the reasons I loved PvP on that server.
---
No, it won't. Majority of classic players will have never played on private servers and that will affect your pserver meta.
---
Even the last ~30% from r9 to 10 is a huge pain if you don't have a premade or if your server doesn't have a big pool of pvp'ers.
---
*laughs in Esfand*
---
I created as BS green iron set(green set from iron ore:d) around 30ish level, felt so super cool. Some fellas asked to make it for them also:d 
---
To get first cape longone felt good also. Extra rewarding feeling for new item not just cos of stats,but look also.
---
Basically I just can wait. Hyped af.
---
You could change the view distance in vanilla with a macro.
---
I mean the distance from the character. 
---
Or what are we talking about??
---
I always felt like the only zones in WoW that were somehow artifical even tho it was a great experience equally whether it was leveling or endgame was in TBC. I didn‘t feel that comfortable like in Azeroth or Northrend. Those hovering isles above Nagrand, Netherstorms unnatural colors I dunno everything together was kinda weird. The only zone I genuinely fell in love with is Zangarmarsh, there was this natural feeling.
---
And if it takes long enough, people that want the rewards only wont just flat out play AV at all.
---
Nnnnoooooooooooo
---
There is ton of information about that on the internet.
---
I always lower the combat sounds a bit and mix about with the sound until I get the music clearly but the ambience is the loudest sort of. When the bad weather hits in STV I honestly felt like putting my character beside the campfire
---
As solo, quest to quest with grind inbetween travel. Solo Powerleveling, is just 60 rushing tbh.
---
I sure as hell wont be farming dungeons for specific drops  before maybe BRD. I am not arguing whether or not its worth it, I am just saying I wont do it.

---
Yup. A lot of leveling guides for everything including professions, gold farming, etc.
---
Heretic!
---
Also, realistic graphics age faster. If you look at older games that went for realism back then, they usually look ugly now as our standards for realism in video games have moved on.
---
Vanilla WoW still looks good and feels immersing to this day. OP is right that their art style is more "timeless".
---
they are honorless targets when they land, for 30 seconds.
---
I don't think I've ever seen that stop someone from killing another player. Ever.
---
Save all small flame sacs you get while leveling and when people are doing MC you’ll make incredible money
---
I would like Blizzard to release classic RN! I WANNA PLAY MY FUTURE ORC WARLOCK CRITTING PEOPLE IN THE FACE GODDAMNIT! I DEMAND RELEASE NAWWWWOOOOW
---
That was a TBC change If I remember correctly, dwarves had mace weapon skill ( used to be extra juicy together with mace stun procs from talents and this two handed mace you could craft(?), Storm something I think it was, dont remember the name. I was playing a warlock and 1h30min arena matches against this combo made me want to kill myself so I remember it pretty well )
---
i dont Think you can pick them with lvl 0 skill
---
Well, when your country is the only superpower left in the world, maybe we will start listening to you. 
---
Also, lighten up. Its obviously a joke.
---
Well, with retail wow in mind, it's patch 8.2 should be released somewhere around mid-late June, I don't think they will release classic in early July. IMHO they will wait at least 1.5 months before classic will go live. So August is a very possible date for it.
---
This 100%. Often graphics being "bad" just means they make me use my imagination more.
---
I remember feeling this way mostly about the Dungeon Keeper series. I genuinely prefer the pixelated, less clear look of the original.
---
Levelling time was heavily reduced (30%) in 2.3, but that wasn’t until a year after TBC was released I think. So depending on what period of TBC you levelled in it might have been quite ‘vanilla like’ or very ‘unvanilla’ basically
---
They used Voice Dictatorship
---
I don't know. On one hand it's frustrating to be ganked immediately when landing and boring to sit and wait for people to land before ganking them. But on the other hand this is one of the ways big PvP battles start. Horde is camping the FP in WPL, so a bunch of recently ganked Allies group up and attack. Horde calls in assistance, Allies call their allies and suddenly you have a massive struggle. 
---
I also like responding to distress calls in a world channel (assuming such a thing will even exist). Predominantly it's in Redridge but sometimes also up in Wetlands and WPL.
---
Yea that sub 1% in total raid dps is really gonna matter. Literally unplayable
---
You can just grind monsters all the way. Should level you up pretty quick compared to questing :)
---
When was Inspect charakter added?
---
I have this problem with consumables while leveling, like scrolls or rum. I always save them for difficult moments until I outlevel them.
---
Better use and replace later
---
what? so what is your advice for solo powerlevelling. what is just 60 rushing..
---
Patch 1.40: 
---
*Honorless Target - Players who just land from a gryphon/wyvern, or step out of an instance will gain this buff for 30 seconds during which this target will give no* [*contribution points*](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_point) *if killed.*   
---
But since we play in 1.12 already this change will be in from start. So dont worry to much about FP farming, unless people are AFK at flightpaths, its not lucrative.
---
I mean, that's kind of the point of the Outland. A broken, inhospitable husk of world that is only held together by twisting nether-magic.
---
I like the idea of a hunter but is is true that they under perform? If so, by how much?
---
Oh, good. I hope it stays this way in Classic.
---
Engineering is probably the most useful profession because almost all of their created items require engineering to use. It's not only in PvP either, if you're going to tank you will want the engineering shield for AoE tanking + grenades for more aggro. Rocket boots and rocket helmet gives you some additional gap closing while the shadow/frost/fire deflectors are hilarious to use. Don't forget to also get the discombob in Gnomeregan. It's an inventory item with 30y range that dismounts the target, turns them into a leper gnome and slows their movement speed. Extremely useful in PvP when chasing people. 
---
Alchemy is more a "nice to have" profession than actually useful. There's usually at least one alchemist in the guild with all the recipes (maybe except flask) and they should craft for free. The flask recipes can be lucrative but with normal black lotus spawns I think flasks will probably be much less used.
---
I think you are in the wrong sub if you are mentioning DHs.
---
I regularly did this with quests that had abysmal drop rates just to fuck with people. Go in, down one mob, loot it, run away. Nothing actually happened, but someone somewhere just permanently lost part of his sanity.
---
I’m curious as well.  I know they underperform on private servers - but were they that bad in actual vanilla?  I played a rogue in vanilla and didn’t know much about the game (didn’t raid).  I do know they are pretty good for PVP though
---
Nobody is being catered for. Re-read OP's post. The issue at hand is the 99.9% who will be farmed mercilessly.
---
Yes, but sharing means less profit ;)
---
Solo powerlevel? Wtf that means
---
I might be, yet there has been a good 100-300k dps on reaping pulls from the dh - without us being any kind of +20 folks
---
yeah no fuck off, if i wanted to sit with my prem and farm afkers all the way through ranking id rank again on one of these russian priv servers.. like you i played wow since 2005, played all the fresh vanilla servers, raided and ranked and i would NOT sit in a fucking boring ass prem day in and day out stomping afkers id much rather run around the world and do 5v5s etc for the first phase.
---
If you equip gear with totally wrong stats then you will performance worse, will have less fun and do forth. If you won't perform enough in like a raid due to that you may loose gear priority. If you want to be a mail only shaman check where that caster mail is. Some is also on leatherworking, some in blacksmithing.
---
yeah and even if its not in from start its added when honor system patch is added.
---
You have 30 seconds to get out of combat and mount away from the honor farmers, unlikely, they will CC and/or chase you until the debuff falls off then kill you.
---
Ohhh clearly you’re a Wrath or even later baby . He just told you . Do quest and kill everything In your path grinding mobs in between each quest and as you’re running back to town etc .
---
I never really clicked. I was an avid player of D2, SC, War3, etc ... then i knew the importance of a good  keybinding.  
---
I started with all my spamable ability on 1-5, then later when i started to PVP at level 60, i had to add more and more keybind.   
---
The pinacle of this was Arena in TBC where i had nearly 40 keybind, with various Shift and alt. At some point, it was more playing piano with GCD.
---
They can just prevent you from mounting and kite you if they dont CC you
---
She's a few years old now; i7 5820k &amp; 980ti but hopefully she'll do!
---
Ehh... i’d re-think that whole “dwarf” part. Humans have increased sword&amp; mace skill(=hit chance) aswell as increased reputation gains.
---
Winter squid 🦑.
---
How xrealm could be worse than no BG at all ?
---
You need to get the same distinct part from all of them, otherwise you could kill one and bring all kind of different parts. Also in my head canon the quest is asking for difficult to obtain parts on purpose. They want you to bring genocide upon all bears in the continent but are only willing to pay for 6. Remember this the next time someone from the opposing faction kills a quest NPC. That fucker probably deserved it.
---
Why are you click baiting your Reddit thread?
---
Im switching. Mostly was alliance, going horde now.
---
Just grind when it releases, 2 days~ should be enough for exalted if you go hard especially on AV weekend. AV is super easy repp compared to ab/wsg.
---
Nope same, apart from Dun morogh, tanaris and feralas i dont really feel much from all the very bland zones like eastern/western plaquelands, marsh or highlands etc.
---
TBC soundtrack alone is also one of the best soundtracks i think blizzard has done, Nagrand and Zangarmarsh especially.
---
I see the "natural" feel also in how they designed Vanilla zones - they had the background for the from WC1/2/3 and books, built the zones around it and _then_ tried to fit in game mechanics like quest hubs/locations in spots where they naturally make sense.
---
This leads to the seemingly clunky/uncoordinated, but also more realistic quest chains in Vanilla - quests were fit into the zones rather than zones built to fit a pre-determined quest design.
---
Zones for later expansions felt more like they were planned on a drawing board ("we need a mountain, a plains and a desert zone" - "each of them needs 4 questhubs" - "quests in each hub need to be conveniently clustered and lead to the next hub").
---
So convenient quest design came first and then zones were built "around" it, leading to a more artificial feel of those newer zones.
---
Yeah, but they aint no dwarfs. Humans could come with free mounts and I would roll dwarf regardless.
---
S:Forward
---
A/D : Strafe left n right
---
I am exactly at the same spot as you are. Never played any pservers, neither I did any of hardcore gameplay in vanilla.   
---
Taking 2 weeks off my work to no-life until 60 with herbalism and skinning. Guess for most of the people my idea is not a rocket-science, but the goal is to farm as much devilsaurs as I can (until I can manage possible contest there without any real time-losses) at least to craft myself a set. herbalism is more like a back-up and long-term profession for me, to go with when I can't farm DL.   
---
Depending on how much I can stock, gonna reroll skinning to engineering and level a decent alt to level-up alchemy  
---
I hope this will create myself a decent air-pillow for a casual gamestyle I'll have afterwards.
---
Would be nice to have weapon speeds on there especially for 2H
---
This is what I kind of put together through various forum posts, but I'm more interested in what kind of quests there are avaiable and how much rep they reward. 
---
This is not coming from a min/max perspective, I'm more just curious of this specific content. I won't be grinding like crazy once it releases, but I'm looking forward to this phase of Classic WoW.
---
The guy at the end that says "I need rez."
---
Yeah, no shit?
---
There is plenty of good guides that makes good speed, i can link you for each faction. Horde: [https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm](https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm) Alliance: [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/)  
---
I have tried and leveled with both, they wont give you server first, but they def will make you fast enough to get 60 in 6-8days played.
---
rofl all these crybabies who got farmed because they couldnt organize their own groups.
---
Just go play pve servers??? if you're scared of groups ganking you then go play pve servers honestly.
---
I too played every single fresh priv server, raided and ranked and i had no problem either getting away or organizing my own groups to kill whatever ''gank squad'' was in the world roaming.
---
Adding wsg just means every casual rankers won't get any honor because they will be stomped relentlessly and it means i will have to sit in a premade from rank0-13 stomping afkers for 3 months instead of walking around and doing fun 5v5s in different open spots.
---
As my hardware got better.
---
In vanilla I used my familys PC and as I learned about how keybinding was helping me, I upgraded to a macbook with a touchpad. I say upgraded because hardware-wise the upgrade was massive AND it allowed me to game wherever. Sadly the keyboard and a single click touchpad for a mouse weren't the best for binding and I bought one of those WoW keyboards with the replaceable button layouts to try and make it more natural. It didn't. When I started University I bought my own tower PC and started to keybind on that which went substantially better. I was still stuck with a default UI though and once I made my own the whole combat experience became much more fluid.
---
In the end though I still fealt held back by awkward finger movements, never having enough keys (I'm not a shift modifyer type of guy), and strained eye movements all over the screen. So at the beginning of Cata, I threw everything i'd learnt in the Trash. I dug out my old Belkin Nostromo and bought a gen:1 razer naga after seeing one at dreamhack. I then disabled everything of the default UI and spent 3 solid days designing and building the perfect UI for me (I have an education in User interface design).
---
Whilst I've iterated on it over the years with minor tweaks, that decision to force myself to start again and do it my way was the best I've ever made. I've upgraded to Razers nostromo now and a new naga after the dreaded double click issue happened but in the end my 'learning how to keybind was part and parcel of my hardware and UI, and I only fealt 100% comfortable when I threw out other peoples and made it my own.
---
This is great stuff! This community gets better and better every day that passes it feels
---
Nope :o Sunstrider EU
---
Patch 1.4 is the start of the honor system so there's literally no reason why this wouldn't be in the game.
---
But you don't understand. People don't farm FP's and instantly kill players. They go to FP's because that's where all the quests are, that's where people afk after landing, and ultimately people just CC or zone players until the 30 seconds end.
---
BTW, guys.   
---
Have some concerns about devilsaur farming. Gonna roll rogue as my main. As far as I can imagine, it won't be easy or even possible to solo farm those elites. What do you think about duo-farming? Like, finding a guy without skinning who will be fine to go like 70\\30?  Or it won't be worth it, any opinion?
---
And you can have capitals mid name too :)
---
The 30 seconds honorless target will be on phase 2 but that doesn't prevent flightpath camping at all.
---
"Huhuran was hotfixed and her AoE enrage poison no longer hits pets or summons."
---
&gt;  that has long BG ques. 
---
I don't see long queues being a thing in Classic. Blizzard will find a way with X-realm BG or other means to balance faction population.
---
Basically, lots of honor = lots of contribution points which is weighted against other players' contribution points and gives you rating points at server restart. 
---
Rank 1 is just 15 honor kills.
---
Rank 2 is 2000 rating points (RP)
---
Rank 3 is 5000 RP
---
Rank 4 is 10000 RP and increasing by 5000 by every rank up to rank 14 which is 60000 RP.
---
The main reason why ranking becomes progressively more difficult is that your rank decays by 20% every week. So if you have 2000 RP you will lose 20% of that, so you'll lose 400 RP. Not a lot, but when you are at 50000 RP (rank 12) you'll lose a whopping 10000 RP every week. That's as much RP as you needed from rank 1 to rank 4, every week. So if you don't PvP at all you'll be bumped down two entire ranks, which is quite rough. Adding to this there's a cap on the amount of RP you can get **and** RP becomes harder to get the more you have, requiring more honor. 
---
There's some more stuff involving brackets and so on, but that's the jist of it.
---
I'm making the switch to horde from Alliance. I've gotten a few horde characters up to about 30, but never above that. Itll be fun to experience new areas and quests that are horde specific.
---
They underperform in PvE from AQ40 onwards, but it really doesn't matter. You will still get invited to raids because of tranq shot, kiting and gear distribution. Unless you really want to see yourself high up on the damage meters, the fact that you do less DPS relative to a warrior or mage doesn't affect you.
---
Thanks for your reply :)

Is there anything useful an engineer can create for non emgineers? Because for me being able to offer my services in a profession is quite important. I get the feeling that engineer is more of a "do it yourself for yourself" profession. Jumper cables come to mind, but I would consider them more of a charakter enhancement than a service.
---
It was an unhealthy system that was way too brutal, this meant people account share constantly completely diminishing its value.
---
Um, are you being legit? I was always told that just grinding mobs was a slow and worthless process
---
I was horde until wrath. Might go alliance to see the world in vanilla from their perspective.
---
You win games. That's literally all you do. Bonus points for doing the one time quests in the BG as well as looting as many corpses as you can for turn in. It's nothing else.
---
As for how long it takes, it's very hard to say, it depends a lot of on the game length. If I recall correctly it's something like 60 wins to get exalted.
---
TLDR: No changes! ^^^...except ^^^my ^^^changes.
---
Gear dependancy in PvP is often overblown. It makes things easier but doesn't overcome coordination, ability and matchup knowledge.
---
If you want to rank, that's what you'll have to do. It's not like corpse camping is something only NEETs do.
---
Chat is moving so fast no one will notice I'm gay.
---
Don't bother with alliance is the best advice.
---
Ok just wanted to make sure you knew the humans superior traits
---
I've had the same thoughts about this. Used to play Alliance but currently trying out a Horde on a private server while I wait for release. Not sure whether I am missing the nostlagia of getting to Stormwind and all the quests round there, or whether I am enjoying the new experience more.  
---
I guess it depends if you are aiming for more nostalgia and wanting to get to level 60 asap, in which case stick with what you know. Otherwise, try something new, as I am enjoying the different areas and am probably going to be playing very casually.
---
I’m not too fussed on damage meters but at the same time we all like to shine. From the sound of things though they have their place, thanks. 
---
Next question, how much of a burden is ammo? Are you always scratching for gold or is it a non issue?
---
I played alliance in vanilla, came back in MoP to a nostalgia guild capped at 60. Levelling to 60 as horde was great enjoyed the levelling immensely and found it to be what you describe, a new experience. However once i hit 60, i hated being horde and ended up rerolling/transferring to alliance.  
---
My reason for hating it was quite pathetic really, but i couldn't shake it. For me it was one simple case of i hated being bigger / taller than the allaince I was trying to kill. It made me feel like i was massacring something smaller and weaker in pvp and that I was expected to be stronger, victories felt meaningless, losses felt crushing. As alliance it always felt like i was trying to kill the big bad that should be stronger than me thing whenever i pvp'd. Victories felt more pleasing, losses didn't bother me.  
---
I know it makes 0 sense, but that why ill be going back to alliance.
---
1 month after 8.2  
---
mid july is my bet
---
They wound up being one of the best guilds in the world all the way until early Burning Crusade.
---
I think there is a fallacy behind this logic. Everyone who regularly PvPs and plays well, wins a majority of their encounters, no matter the level or gear.
---
A very unique and interesting build indeed, it looks very fun. Would have loved to see the talents.
---
So put together a group of 60s to clear them out?
---
There's lots of stuff out there. You could spend days on YouTube learning the outline and then weeks searching forums on the fine points, but I think it comes down to this:
---
1. Choose a PVE server
---
2. Choose a class/spec that has a reputation for fast leveling and low gear dependence, like Beast Master Hunter
---
3. Don't train any professions except First Aid
---
4. Learn resource management to minimize downtime
---
5. Grind quests
---
6. Kill every mob you encounter on the way too and from questing
---
7. Skip instances, unless you can group up with people who can speed run things without wipes
---
8. Don't waste time and money in the AH, except to sell stuff
---
But do you really want to miss out on all of the game experience that comes with world PVP, training professions, fucking around in Barrens chat, playing the AH, and the special joy of doing your third corpse run in RFC because the healer can't heal and the hunter can't send pet without aggroing a dozen mobs?
---
Been horde in '06, will be horde in '19.
---
I never played an alliance character and i could never switch factions, i just like the horde too much.
---
We don't need no bubbleboys!
---
You should either roll on a pve server or adapt and endure.
---
Why would you force rankers to sit in a bg queue 12 hours a day for 3 months, running flags against afk players who cannot organize and instead will just roll over until they get a pug v pug instead of doing actual fun 5v5s+ in the open world?
---
If your fp/quest hub is getting ganked because you're in a level 50 zone, maybe you should organize with other players of your faction to take it back? If you get ganked maybe you should team up with someone for revenge?? It's the point of a pvp server. You fight all the time and youre forced to group up with others to do things. If you're outnumbered and you really have no friends or no way to get back you go to another zone or do something different for a while ?? I don't understand why people who are too lazy to even play the game feel like they should have an opinion on these kinds of things.
---
It's not just about gank squads. Solo casuals will have to gank and corpse camp too if they want to gank. And that will have a domino effect, non-rankers will gank in return for fear of getting ganked 1st. It's going to be a shit show.
---
I understand that feeling. For some reason, even if you're in an open world, you feel like you're boxed in. WoW feels so open and welcomes adventure!
---
Lol and what makes this even more hilarious is it's basically like this the whole way. Even switching out Tier pieces makes your toon look like a dope most of the time
---
It absolutely is if anyone wants to be able to play for the first month.
---
found a big mistake in the first Part. Hey Ranking bout the raid boss they Killed with 25 man in wow endgame Content in 2006. there wasnt any 25 man raids
---
You dont get world first my ”playing it safe” ridiculous.
---
Just move location, what you describe is the very point of pvp servers. Your never safe, you have to watch your back and you have to learn to work around the horde threat.  
---
You want world pvp but by your terms, thats not how it works. A 60 ganking you is no different from you ganking a same lvl players fighting mobs or low on hp. PvE is exactly the answer for what you want. You can flag when you want to pvp and safe when you dont want to be.  
---
"I want to play on pvp" You only want to play on pvp so you can choose to gank others when you have the advantage and be safe from those who can do that to you. Otherwise the pve option of tagging yourself for pvp would be fine.
---
I'd add Pudgy to the ret list. He knows how to alter his gear once AQ rolls out.
---
You don’t get world first by “Playing it safe” ridiculous.
---
Dwarfs are shorter because they dont need space for all those fucks they dont give.   
---
(Seriously, thanks for pointing it out. But I think choosing the class/race you like over the class/race that is better on paper is instrumental for having fun in a game like WoW. Just my opinion tho, min/maxers will most likely disagree and thats fair too)
---
Not even mentioning all the new flightpaths... I re-rolled a new main after TBC came out, and 1-60 was a breeze.
---
Perhaps it was, but it is stated in all seriousness all the time, right along side that obnoxious horse radish you just uttered. How many PTSD riddled old veterans you guys are neglecting is no fit measure of strength, nor is this strength worth a dime of respect - no more than any pissing contest.
---
It is possible to solo them as an almost pre raid bis rogue, I have done so myself
---
 you can just play a pve server if you can't take it..
---
Why would you force rankers to sit in a bg  queue 12 hours a day for 3 months, running flags against afk players  who cannot organize and instead will just roll over until they get a pug  v pug instead of doing actual fun 5v5s+ in the open world?
---
If  your fp/quest hub is getting ganked because you're in a level 50 zone,  maybe you should organize with other players of your faction to take it  back? If you get ganked maybe you should team up with someone for  revenge?? It's the point of a pvp server. You fight all the time and  youre forced to group up with others to do things.

I don't understand why  people who are too lazy to even play the game feel like they should have  an opinion on these kinds of things.
---
Seems to me a lot of people in this thread are scared they wont get br1 with open world pvp instead of just farming ezmode wsg and it will take longer for them to rank. Then theres also a group of casuals who got farmed everywhere on pservers because they couldn't make any friends and would rather just roll over instead of learning to play.
---
Do we have any certitude about Lupos? Will he be the one wolf to rule them all for some time or?
---
Good luck finding a pair at level 15. This isn't a private server. Drop rates are realistic and since the servers are fresh the ah will be barren and expensive
---
Unfortunately, Elemental fire won’t be anywhere near as profitable in Classic as it is on Private servers. The Alchemy transmute- Heart of fire into a few elemental fires will dramatically lower costs. Zero word about professions not being 1.12 so I’d assume they’ll be with specific OP items gated. Eg. titanic leggings
---
Considering the world will be in its 1.12 state I believe it will be Broken Tooth as the one cat to rule them all.
---
Hunter is a great gold farming class and arrows are never really a problem as far as gold is concerned. If you want to really push your damage to the limit in PvE, you can farm special arrows called [Doomshot](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12654). I wouldn't recommend it though, it would take you ages to get just enough arrows to last you an entire raid run.
---
Meaning not with a Friend etc group
---
You will be able to solo Maraudon for consistent gold whenever you need to save up for things. Or you could go engineering and produce your own BiS ammo. Overall hunter is quite an easy life.
---
I gotta say part of the art style is that I could always understand what the characters were doing. Beauty cannot come at the expense of clarity or game design. I do love me some beautiful HD graphics though!
---
&gt; Such a tiny little fraction of the player base is even able to attempt that
---
It only takes a few players per zone to ruin questing, especially in a narrow zone like Felwood with only a few questing areas. Same with Winterspring. You ride on the road and kill everyone on sight. It's gonna happen, it only takes a handful of people.
---
Would you like to know more?
---
I dont want to fall behind!
---
Whatever dude. You just want to be bitter. 
---
By the way, I am a 10 year US Army vet. 
---
Get over yourself and laugh at a joke.
---
How on earth do you think a paladin has higher uptime than a warrior?
---
I alt'ed a hunter through the TBC content after it has been on farm for a long while, I seem to remember Survival was the optimal DPS past a certain gear point and I remember realling enjoying that spec. I take it that isn't the case ever in vanilla as there aren't enough talents to go deep enough into the Marksman tree whilst still getting that juicy 15% agility bonus. (And weaker enchants, no gem slots etc.)
---
Is MM still PvE dps and Beast for PvP, does Survival really have a place or is a bit of a dead spec?
---
“What we know” then posts nothing but conjecture and guesses
---
If you grind on correct mobs it is absolutely worthwhile and will many times save you time because you won't have to run around looking for quests to fill in when you are missing a level for the next zone.
---
There's no way you can l2p more than people who have been playing private servers for the past decade. There's also no way a single player can organize random strangers in an efficient way agaisnt people who are organized specifically to gank. 
---
Let's not pretend it's an even playing field here.
---
Even the last ~30% from r9 to 10 is a huge pain if you don't have a premade or if your server doesn't have a big pool of pvp'ers. I had to farm like 250k honor on a pserver to get to r10. It's quite a lot for a casual.
---
It’s not even a job, it’s account sharing. It will basically be impossible for a normal person to get it, people will pay Chinese farmers to play 24 hours a day on their account.
---
I'm having the same conundrum
---
We had enough summers
---
I remember he sounds a little bit like Michael Jackson
---
Go take a look around this subreddit... The game is going to be populated with 75% casuals!
---
Oh, interesting.  I did look at the code; it's just HTML with a blurp of JavaScript for the Summer countdown clock.  I thought it might have been linked to some outside source.
---
the more the slower. but maybe more fun. so maybe worth it.
---
Unlikely. Those are 2 separate teams working on 2 different content development stages. I don't think they interfere with each others work.
---
at least the tank wont have aggro problems
---
Yes your plan works but I'd recommend just getting blacksmithing once you're lvl 60 and more established. You only need 235 or so blacksmithing but that's still hundreds of mithril and not worth slowing your levelling down.
---
Engineering is the best profession for tanks with blacksmithing being good to have for fear fights. Other professions might be cheaper but don't offer much beyond monetary gain.
---
Thats wrong. Most LBRS quests are 5 man.
---
That's correct.
---
I am not sure 1-60 in 2 weeks is realistic without a) 16 hours a day b) having a preplanned route. c) having a group always there to do group quests quick and give that exp boost from dungeons etc. (Maybe if you are rolling tank / healer you will find these groups easier). Also bear in mind PvP server vs PvE (Do you wanna be wasting time corpse running or getting into skirmishes or waiting for quest NPC to spawn). Gathering professions slow levelling but increase gold. 
---
Not to be negative but to be realistic, I'd say just don't make levelling super quick your only aim. 
---
Also pick 2 gathering professions: Herb + Skinning / Mining is what I'm going for. Don't sell the materials immediately, stockpile them on a bank alt. People will have farmed more gold 4-6 weeks later and will want to power level professions that they didn't do while they power levelled their hero, meaning you can probably get a good start on your lvl 60 epic riding if you play the AH careful. You could also use the materials to boost your own professions instead and look to farm flask recipes quickly etc.
---
Goblin Rocket Boots are BOE, don't require engineering to use and can be equipped by all levels, but that's it I think. My priest is an engineer/tailor - I buy the mats I need for engineering. I guess tailoring isn't an obvious choice for a warrior but you can make cloaks/bags which can be useful.
---
&gt;There isn't a single class whose optimal raid spec is also the optimal pvp spec
---
Holy paladin though.
---
its not rare to see rets doing less dmg than the tank
---
yes, a decent ret with decent gear can pull his weight, although less than an equally skilled/geared dps class
---
that is no exaggeration or extreme case of especially bad player, that happens regulary
---
I REALLY hope Blizzard will pick up on this.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Vanilla+wow+black+lotus+respawn
---
Random wolf with aoe buff will be the one to rule them all for PVE, Broken tooth will be for PVP since attack speed.
---
If it doesn't specify melee critical strikes then it could be both. I'm not sure if it's intended but that's how the wording means should work.
---
This is honestly new ground for Blizzard. What OP says about how min maxed and shit Classic will be is true. Every single efficient method to achieve..anything in the game has been found and confirmed and practiced to hell.
---
After a specific gear point deep survival with lightning reflexes results in higher dps than a mm. But this is only at the very end of vanilla content the case when your allready geared t3.
---
Also this requires your guild to accept that you won’t supply trueshot aura.
---
For pvp 0/31/20 is the way to go.
---
They're not elites. They can be solo'd, I don't know if all classes can solo em though.
---
I’ll never forget my best PvP week honor wise. I remember  earning more than I ever had before around 100,000 honor. Sitting at around rank 8/9 I was ready for a massive boost to my rank. 
---
In the end I think I moved around 20% towards the next rank. Contacted a GM complaining. 
---
He said get over it. Tough times for 15 year old me.
---
good...good...
---
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.  It's the picky raid leaders you want to crucify, not me.
---
This, the people inflating honor caps are not players but people who do it for money. And they are not necessarily Chinese even. If there was no money people could just agree on reasonable honor caps (that are still higher that some casuals outside the collusion cannot fuck up).
---
I speak only of experience from meeting Americans in various countries and continents, including your own. You are not some gift to the world, at best you are the laughing stock, at worst the thought of what asinine thing your gonna do next cringe stresses people. I do indeed laugh at jokes, which is why I cope best by pretending your country is a tale invented by a comedian.
---
More please, with colors!
---
that sucks, thats one of the things thats the downside to staying only in the same version of vanilla, lots of talent trees thats not complete.
---
You can learn about basic consumes/items to get away from being camped for example. Rankers will not walk around with 20+ people because it's not efficient honor. Instead they will run around in 3-5-10 man groups and throughout your leveling you have the opportunity to make enough friends to organize a group of the same size. There will be other people in the zone who probably want revenge too and that's what playing on a pvp server is about.
---
They appear to see if the node is alive....and then they log onto their main to gather
---
My heart belongs to the Horde.
---
I missed my pink dress from Ahn’Qiraj in TBC. That thing was badass on an undead.
---
They don’t underperform in vanilla they offer good to great dps for all content up until after BWL.  So for the majority of content. Besides that they supply great utility to the raid.
---
For example warlocks are the other way arround they only offer mediocre dps up until after BWL when they start to go strong.
---
In pvp sustained dps is irrelevant. So here they are a nice pick all arround with strong burst potential.
---
get consecration and you good to tank the shit out of the dungeons lol
---
Damn dude, you nailed what I have been trying to figure out myself. I have a hard time liking newer zones in the game, and I just couldn’t pin-point why. But now I know why, it’s as you say, the zones have TOO much in them. And the devs make sure you can NOT stray too far from the main path.
---
That was one of the reasons I didn’t like the zones in legion. Most of the surrounding areas are blocked off or similar, and it annoyed the hell out of me, it’s like they punish you for trying to explore.
---
Players like the feeling of ”outsmarting” things. Like they have found a way to skip enemies or areas. But it’s not just possible in the newer zones.
---
I'm 42, have no wife, no gf, no kids, no job. I'm your opposite, hi!
---
So you mean.. leveling as normal? It doesn’t seem like you know what you’re talking about. Just use a leveling guide if you want to level quickly..
---
There is tons of guides to professions already on Youtube. 
---
Frostadamus is one of the channels that does great guides.
---
What exact talent build is the 0/31/20 you speak of and would you say its more battleground oriented? I've got a few builds in mind as open world and/or dueling present their own unique situations.
---
I already took my vacation, can't wait any longer for blizzard.
---
What a pity... Summer is right in front of the door and they can't get us a release date. 
---
Goddamn.
---
I use A and D for abilities, and QWES for movement (Q and E are strafe). its more convinient and number keys are closer to your fingers.
---
reaching from D to 3 or 4 is way less convinient, and simply a longer distance than from E to 3. 
---
r,f,t all are easy accessible aswell.
---
honestly i don't know why ppl use AWSD, its way less convinient. guess, just cos they are used to it.
---
you don't really need keyboard turns, the rare cases that i need (or just want to give a rest for my right arm), i just use arrow keys.
---
i was never a #nochanges at all kind of guy. Vanilla had its many flaws and after i played it retail for a year and another 5 years on private servers i can see them for what they are. Private servers that provided the most fun for everyone had almost exactly the same release schedule except for BGs are released from the start. (also with OP gear versions of PvP gear) 
---
And to be honest r14 gear is SUPPOSED to be OP as fuck. If you put your life into a game to get that shit you DESERVE stuff like that. 
---
The whole point of vanilla is the oneshot OP potential that some characters can posess. Not the outhealing for 30min never dying bullshit that goes on in wow nowadays.
---

Is Survival just a meme spec for PVP or can you actually make it work in vanilla?
---
Yeah no only if it was that simple. It depends on your class, faction, server type, server population etc. The best way to level up is questing with grinding supplemented in. There is a lot of guides explaining this.
---
Good point
---
Honestly I am amazed at how many people didn't map stuff, I played mostly on console, and then d2 on pc so I was very used to the push button X happens effect, I still clicked on some stuff but never for stuff I regularly used in combat
---
Nah dude, the elitists are always a very small player base. You will be fine, just play to have fun and you will find friends and a guild who will accept you.
---
The greatest part of classic and burning crusade was that server reputation was everything. Back then you didnt server change or name change, people knew who everyone was. Hopefully it will be the same this time.
---
Dont think so. I believe they run wow classic on the same engine as retail. Thats why the demo looked somewhat better than original vanilla (more grass for example).
---
"... that's what playing on a pvp server is about." 
---
The state of knowledge in vanilla and the state of knowledge in classic is vastly different, particularly with the likely influx of all the private server pvp players. 
---
What you are saying might well be true if people were not aiming to min max on their climb to rank 14, but let's have some intellectual honesty about what classic will be like.
---
This is awesome, however there is a tiny detail that bothers me: the potion's name is actually "greater fire protection potion". Keep up the good work!
---
You will meet people who encourage you instead of brining you down to their levels. But yeah there will always be toxic 14 year olds raging in games.   
---
Play meet people, then you will find good people, good friends and people you find fun to play with, no matter what experiance or skill they have, there is always rotten eggs.
---
but what about ranged, they're physical too ;)
---
if it procs off hunter attacks and spells as well as melee then it's gotta be one of the best talents in the game
---
Being elitist does not mean you won't help noobs
---
A problem would be that people not interested in that much PvP will just stay level 59 and do dungeons just fine.
---
There are people on pserver ranking to 11 at 59 to stay in the 50-59bracket. 
---
So you'd have to make it 54-60 in order to prevent people doing Stratholme, UBRS etc. just slightly lower level playing the system.
---
Agreed, Tirisfal is my favorite starting area. I was thinking of doing the exact opposite on an orc character.
---
Nostalgia is one hell of a drug
---
They spawn in 4 zones.  1 spawn can be up in a zone at a time.  They are on about an hour spawn timer.
---
HANDLE IT!
---
As a rogue these may have been my favorite potion - I loved the increased uptime while grinding mobs!
---
I think they will both be equally shitty this time around lol
---
Dungeons no problem.  
---
Raids as retribution sure in my casual guild you would be welcome.  
---
As long as you know the drill.  Your pulling snake boss in Zg. ( bubble pull). 
---
Your sacrifice your self for a priest in a good spot if we are going to wipe. 
---
You cleanse if needed and you heal if needed (on death of other healers).  
---
If you can play your class then your always welcome in my runs.
---
the Auto attack and the seal can both proc the axe, so I guess it has a higher chance of proccing then a warrior?
---
There are incredibly toxic players, it has nothing to do with you and you will not be safe no matter how good you are. They are not the overall majority luckily.
---
my comment was more about warlocks having more tools than just fear for the horde in general. not to specifically counter the undead racial
---
Lol why did you sign that off with “no changes” they’re literally releasing it in its final vanilla version.
---
Also, having a previous version of AV doesn’t solve anything. The people that are in there for rep will get it done in a couple weeks and never come back and premades can still zerg the enemy boss. The only thing an older version would mean is that pvpers wanting to rank will have to spend months of their lives killing high value npc’s for honour over and over instead of actually pvping. 
---
I don’t know about you but I’d rather pvp to rank rather than afk in bunkers with the occasional npc kill for hours on end.
---
Yeah just because you might be an elitist or nolifer. does not incline you need to be an asshole. Many people with great knowledge or skill, dont mind at all helping people to improve themselfs.
---
Sorry, but it's 1.12 version. So good fiber connection and nice 19'' 1280 × 1024 LCD are common.
---
My hopes are that it will be a supportive community, but that might be overly optimistic.
---
My recommendation would just to be straight up with people. "I've never been here, so let me know if there's anything to look out for" or "this is my first time healing, any tips?"
---
For me, if I knew that someone was actually putting effort into trying to get better, they'd get loads of respect from me and I'd do what I could the help out.
---
90% of those people won't hit 60
---
It becomes better at later levels but the first 10 is so painful.  Auto attacking and having a healing spell.  Ty blizzard.
---
They most definitely are elites
---
when you need to run in one direction but look backwards or to the sides. (can happen in wpvp, vurtne used turn keys situationally. also aim grenades)
---
without turning keys you can only run in the one direction or strafe abit. but in wpvp there can be some obstacle or a pass turn. So you actually need to turn. but you cant unless you stop looking in the direction you want. 
---
also it can be convinient, when you do something in menus, atlas or profession screens with your mouse, while moving so you can still control your character moving in the world with keyboard.
---
I mean attempt playing 16+ h a day. The advantage gankers have is that they well, gank. They have the first strike, which is huge and they are grouped which is even bigger.
---
I always tell my friends/guildies who are less experienced in PvP to group while questing and everytime someone asks for an opinion on gear I suggest to wear the piece with higher defensive stats (stam/int/spirit/armor/resistance).
---
I also regularly ganked/counterganked in retail vanilla and I still do it. And again, gear is really not as big of a deal as people make it out to be, except if were talking huge progression differences. The biggest difference is bringing another player and the second most important thing is player ability.
---
&gt;BGs are released from the start. (also with OP gear versions of PvP gear)
---
Nost had the blue set in ZG, it was deemed too strong and since then it's been either ZG or 1.10.
---
&gt;Current private server playerbase is indimidating and toxic towards newer or less skilled players
---
never experienced something like that.
---
One of the big things for me was that the game itself felt dangerous, you couldn’t just wonder around running through enemy camps with 50 mobs chasing you and come out unscathed. You also spent far more time in zones so you really got to know them, while now you blast through micro zones in 39 mins, move onto a new quest hub and never return - the old style of having a town or two in each zone, plus quests scattered throughout, really made each zone feel more epic. It feels like a theme park right now.
---
The knowledge is past down to rankers in 5minutes.
---
Queue BG -&gt; run to RFC -&gt; drop group -&gt; get ported to Kargath -&gt; fly to Burning Steppes -&gt; gank for 16hours a day.
---
Repeat until R14. 
---
There, the meta explained in 1 1/2 minutes in text.
---
Depends on if you are running with a group or by yourself (or the competency of your paladins really)
---
If your running solo with a mixed bag of players it can be quite annoying, with the RNG nature of how teams are made on both sides you will sometimes have matches against 4 UD rogues etc, other times you will have a beastly holy pally who will save your bacon time and time again AND sometimes the other team won't have a priest for dispels
---
Premades are overall better for a ally lock, paladins benefit you way more than shamans do, shaman are annoying with grounding/tremor totem and earth shock, but you can stay outside of shamans range and use your pet to stomp totems. Your dots don't get dispelled nearly as frequently, and BOP,BOS,BOF help you out a ton.
---
I love this idea! This would be such a fun RP character too!
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
---
Because the system ranked you up or down based on how much pvp you did in comparison to your own faction, meaning you had to do more than everyone else on your faction for an extended period (weeks/months) of time, and since people like pvp and are also competitive this means upwards of 16-18 hours of playing per day, sometimes account sharing in order to keep the character going 24/7.
---
they flip flopped for 2 months but in the end it was reverted to the strong stats.
---
I feel that once youve tried it in retail version that its gonna feel weird going back to the vanilla view distance.
---
2015 or 2005? xD Titles are confusing :p
---
Both Nig'thaven and K3 did this. Nig'thaven didnt have any BGs. K3 effectively didnt have any because of the queue anywhere in the world function.
---
Both servers dipped and never recovered.   
---
Everybody went to the one where you could simply abstain from the horrible reality that is being ganked 15times from Morgans Vigil into BRM.
---
stop whining.
---
&gt; Current private server playerbase is indimidating and toxic towards newer or less skilled players, hoping classic will be a bit more forgiving.
---
That is far from true in my experience. People are generally very helpful if you try to improve. Just be open about your experience and playstile and own your mistakes.
---
So what your saying is........Extremely rare.
---
Thank you.
---
This is the classic WoW subreddit, take your hate with you while you leave and thanks.
---
Never experienced any of this. and I'm a die hard pserver tryhard.
---
Shattered Hand best server. I'm still here!
---
I like this competition, but could someone please organize a REAL *speedrunning* competition, where the contestants battle on who runs the fastest across whole kalimdor or eastern kingdoms, from the southernmost tip to all the way up. No speed buffs or items, just optimizing the route and avoiding dazes. I’d definitely bet my money on such a race that would be streamed.
---
Feral dps IS viable granted youre putting in more effort just to be average. This game is 15 years old, almost every spec has been explored enough that it has some sort of talent/ability rotation with gimicky items that makes it at least average.
---
You have to bear in mind that private server players are the hardcore vanilla fans, not the average fans. As with all fanbases, the group of the biggest fans tends to have a significant number who turn elitist and regard fans not as dedicated as them to be "not real fans".
---
You'll find the official Classic servers will end up with a far higher portion of more casual players. The elitists will still be around but they'll be a much smaller proportion of any particular server's population.
---
Are you a min-maxer bleeding edge raider?
---
I think this is a problem all old games have to deal with. Most people have played for a very very long time and expect a certain level of skill from the people they play with. It's what makes it so difficult for new players to pick up these kinds of games
---
I tend to be friendly and helpful all the time as long as the people aproaching me are down to earth and able to take constructive criticism, nothing worse than mediocre at best players acting cocky, instant /ignore.
---
We bathe!
---
Some people are abit over the top though, no need to whisper me every single day when im pvping or raiding.
---
Nagrand, Zangarmarsh, HFP, and the BElf starting zones will have a special place in my heart always. I’d jump at the opportunity to level another blood elf paladin to 70 if classic ever progresses to the next xpac.
---
Druid is not the worst 1v1 class lol. Everywhere you look has them waaay above. 1v1 dueling Druids are baller.
---
For this reason i have considered going alliance. Thing is, i am pretty set on rolling shaman. 
---
I dont even know what i would play if it isbt going to be shaman.
---
Looks nice man! I dont know if this was suggested already, but theres a lot of just empty space, i was thinking you could add where the particular item drops as something you could just glance at. 
---
This would make the site much more accessible at a glance, like when youre farming for your bis you can just check where you can get the next piece youre looking for. 
---
Also maybe a small checkbox system where you could cross over/whatever an item you have already acquired, again to help with gearing on the go.
---
Did a [small mockup in paint](https://prnt.sc/naz783) of what it could look like with the loot locations. The checkboxes were an afterthought and im too lazy to do another mockup, but im sure you can think of something.
---
If theres more ppl on the other side in general, no matter what you do, you cannot balance the population. Aka queues.
---
People talk up the community of Classic, but there were some real jerks that I encountered. To be fair though, I met some really friendly and helpful people too. The great thing about playing Classic now is that you don't have to be clueless that first time you tank or heal in an instance. You can research optimal rotations for your abilities and watch playthroughs of whatever you're doing in game. That'll take some of the mystery and fun away, but it'll go a long way to cooling some of the assholery that you pick up from folks that expect flawless performance every time.
---
Take all quests inside or outside that needs you to kill bosses and take towers.
---
You will do them naturally.
---
Scrap the rest unless insignia quest.
---
Was Alliance for all of Vanilla. Never played on a private server (for any serious length of time, I got to like level 22 or something on one then it restarted and I didn't start over, I was Alliance again though). Will be playing Horde in Classic.
---
You can take a big hydraulic suck on my goblin rocket stick
---
I am not really interested in Guides, at least not if they are what I would consider a typical profession guide. Those that tell you what to do, where to go, which mats to farm, etc. I want to find out all that stuff by myself, its part of the experience in my opinion. Picking a profession and realizing later that its not fun for me is something I would rather avoid though.
---
Expected generalisation from fascist swine is to bedste expected.
---
Just disable camera auto follow if you want to run in one direction and look in another
---
Dude, don't leave us. We are already out numbered.
---
50 DKP MINUS
---
depends where you are really, private servers are 90% european which is why they're absurdly toxic, if you're over there i would expect more of the same for retail
---
i actually think vanilla has much more viable alternatives than people generally talk about.  I'm gonna be playing a pala and mostly raiding but i'll be doing some pvp with spell damage and a 26/25/0 spec.  
---
seals and judgements benefit from spell damage, as does consecrate.  as do certain weapon procs (e.g. that mace which procs a 150 damage fireball), as do things like shadow oil.  
---
this spec lets you heal pretty effectively as well as makes you a bit tankier against physical damage, has reduced CDs AND lets you put out some pretty solid damage that is also quite effective against warriors and druids (unlike ret which is partly screwed by armour)  
---
stuff like shadow oil and engineering really open up the options, and sometimes its not all about getting the slowest, highest top end weapon you can find.  this is what i love about vanilla
---
MOAR DOTS!
---
You're the one acting like the picky raid leader's autism is truth
---
Sounds like someone just got kicked from a group
---
HaHaa ret sUCks DiCK aM I rITe XDDD
---
A BRE wielding warrior is not overblown. Autohit, mortal strike, windfury proc, maybe a sword proc and there goes another clothie. 
---
ToEP on a mage? Pewpew burst incoming.
---
Perditions Blade on a rogue? Oneshot clothies with dagger spec.
---
Stuff like Eshkandars Collar gives huge stats like Stamina, Flameguard gauntlets are asily worn to R12. 
---
Some MC stuff really makes people monsters who can press two buttons to delete fresh 60s.
---
The minmaxer rankers will be at the optimal honor spots which is not the lvl48 campers in felwood/tanaris etc.
---
Instead they will be in BS/Menethil/DM entrance/BRM trying to kill level60s, there will be organized rankers of both factions who will fight for these spots (actual pvp) and all the unorganized rankers who will be ganking the lowlevels or in other zones you can easily kill with your friends. If the BS fp is getting camped you can fly to redridge and walk the rest of the way with your friends and kill the people at the fp??  You're also acting like there are thousands of these organized guilds already established when there has really only ever been 3-5 guilds from priv servers who know the game and are already set up and they won't be on every server.
---
Hey, it isn't just tanks who can stand near the boss and barely do any damage! I demand the respect I deserve!
---
I clicked from Vanilla all the way until halfway through WotLK. My parents cancelled my WoW sub for a few months bc we were low on funds. So I jumped into the private server scene, and it turns out most of the servers I found were instant 80 PvP servers. Players quickly realized I was keyboard turning and clicking, had a couple helpful people teach me the ways of keybinds and wow was it a night and day difference. When I came back to retail my friends were floored at how much better I played after seemingly not playing for months. Felt great!
---
As an Alliance player, I trust the Trolls and Tauren on this...
---
Very few things, but discombob is one of them. The beauty is that it's a relatively unknown item so very few have the recipe. Especially on Horde side because you get it in Gnomer. 
---
For moneymaking it's probably not the best, but you get a lot of tools and helpful items that you can use in PvP and PvE. 
---
If you want a marketable profession you should probably go with enchanting or blacksmithing. The enchanting recipes are quite hard to get but very lucrative, especially the MC/AQ ones. Blacksmithing has a few really high worth recipes like Lionheart, Titanic leggings, Nightfall. But these also require that your guild choose you to have the recipe. 
---
I would rely more on your gathering profession for moneymaking, except if you can become guild enchanter or guild blacksmith etc.
---
I never followed them but for some reason I never forgot a blog post they made about the bad change to 25 man raiding and standing atop ICC regardless or something? Idk probably misremembering since it changed for TBC.
---
Welcome, may The Light shine on you.
---
Not likely I will be running with people just like me ;)
---
I thought that r10 was a realistic goal for someone who doesnt want to farm too much. Your comment made me question that.
---
Deep survival? One of the better PvP builds puts 20 points into that tree, there's good stuff in there for PvP for sure.
---
Is there any mod or anything that can let you know what zone they are spawning in? Or do you just have to wait until you find one in a zone to know what zone it's spawning in?
---
lol? thats not what i was saying, you need to turn while looking in the other direction. 
---
if you use mouse to look, you cant possibly use it to turn your character at the same time.
---
In a current Pserver, it’s very fun to do dungeons with alt of elites players like globo....
---
One wipe and they ragequit the group.
---
Haha.
---
I think the big concern is the blue gear. It's *really* good in 1.12 and not a crazy grind to obtain like rank 14 weps.
---
Survival makes you more toolkit-y at the cost of gimping your damage. You get a bunch of additional CC abilities.
---
I never played on pservers so I don't know what they're thought of there but certainly in Vanilla *everyone* was marksmanship.
---
I always played alliance, playing horde for a more refreshing classic experience
---
That's exactally what I plan on doing, just the other way around.
---
I've always played Allliance, but I want to try out horde with Classic.
---
There is a chance you may get more lost because you don't know the zone but I see that as a good thing as that means you get to explore new areas!
---
That seems like such specific and rare scenario I dont think its worth losing 2 insanely comfortable binds for it
---
When vanilla was live, I was like 13/14... i absolutely lived and breathed world of warcraft. But did I know what I was doing? Hell no... it was my first MMO and I was way too busy just being absorbed by how blown away I was that I was in an entire new world... in my computer. 
---
I didn't know what raiding was until level cap, I didn't use key binds, I didn't know there was a 'meta' or even builds... I selected the class/race and talents that I liked the most and it worked for me. I had so much fun. 
---
I've come a long way since then and I kinda wish I didn't... but one thing I'll be doing when classic releases, is exactly what I WANT. 
---
Idgaf what the best builds/classes and specs are and if somebody is gonna give me shit for leveling as a full holy paladin using a 2her... Well that just tells me that they they get zero satisfaction from real life achievements and feel the need to show off in-game to get a sense of fulfilment. 
---
TLDR; Who cares what 'elitists' or anyone else thinks... Release your inner naivety and your inner child... and just have fun. Do what YOU want to do.
---
I see the art style as being generally the same now, just with higher technical quality.
---
I see more of a difference in the same the zone layouts are designed. Often they are created to funnel players through them in a certain way, while the older zones felt more open and invited to exploration.
---
Plate dps gear? Gimme that sweet leather!
---
I felt the same way at first but upon looking at how underwhelming the old versions of pvp gear were I realized that the updated versions is the only viable option. 
---
The weapons are generally ~AQ 40 quality but significantly below naxx. The Armor is good but isn’t nearly as game breaking as the weapons as they’re very stamina heavy since they’re tailored for pvp. 
---
Do you seriously think it’s a good idea to have the weapons that are behind a 3+month no life grind (3 is the best case scenario, very likely to take much longer) be just shitty versions of bwl gear for the sake of slightly better balance? Let the no lives be overpowered for a couple months. Once AQ comes out it won’t be an issue, not that it will be one to begin with.
---
You’ll probably see more people with sulfuras than you do rank 14 melee and sulfuras is more powerful and can be obtained before the ranking system even comes out so do you want that changed too?
---
BM Hunters in Classic didn't exist for the specific reason that Bestial Wrath *only* applied to the pet, not the Hunter. The player also getting the BW buff came about in TBC.
---
No I don’t want it. I love having bg’s that were your server only. It shows who’s badass and who sucks on your server. You begin to fear those players who you know have god like mechanics and you can make a name for yourself on your server. Xrealm bg’s ruins all of that, and you just become another number.
---
Create a Paladin toon on your Alliance server. Make a Shaman (or whatever other class interests you) toon on your Horde server. See which you enjoy more.  
---
But, seriously, I'll hunt down your toon and camp your corpse if you betray the Horde.
---
This made my morning lol ty sir
---
Ive been in a dilemma about joining the alliance because i want to play blood elf and cant in vanilla... but i couldnt do it. I JUST COULDNT. 
---
Im playing undead in classic and hoping one day TBC Classic comes out + services so i can race change to blood elf then.
---
Yours is a different story.. maybe play warrior and also hope for TBC Classic and then create a blood elf paladin
---
6hp/5sec &lt;-&gt; 72hp/1min does not sound like that much to me
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
By definition, they are not getting everything out of their class. And therefore it's carrying. If you use spec that is 25% less effective then that is effectively the same as being 25% afk in the raid.
---
Once you reach above a certain agility threshold, 30 surv points outdamage 31 mm - because of the +15% agi in deep survival tree. 
---
The consensus is that it happens in AQ40 gear, but it also depends on whether your trueshot would be spread to maximum usage (rogues and warriors).
---
Its what you do, when your mom isnt watching.
---
Why?
---
I'd recommend trying a private sever, or playing the free up to level 20 and trying a couple of new classes if you haven't played in quite a while. Might find even though Classic WoW won't have changed over all the years, what you want to play might have.  
---
I used to play Rogue, slashing around everywhere like a classic teenager back then, now I'd rather chill back more and heal so I'm currently playing with a priest at the moment.
---
I think found Black Lotuses in Silithus, Un'Goro and EPL back in the day. Not 100% sure I remember it correctly though and I can't say which fourth zone it would be
---
A lot of people who don't want to grind rank 14 are okay with this. The only areas you will really have to worry about are BRM and EPL. 
---
Remember, grey enemies do not give honour so if they're killing lowbies they would be killing lowbies regardless of the rank system. I'd love to see 2 months of a system that invites world pvp because then it may end up reminding people just how fun it is living in a dangerous Azeroth.
---
Gressil and THC.
---
It is when it takes you a while to walk to places
---
I think a lot of "oldschool" players which are now ~30+ years old will be playing Classic - and they're generally laid back and mature. So I expect a pretty good experience - I know I won't mind helping any newbies.
---
I was wondering how outnumbered Horde would be at launch... from what I remember it was something like 70/30 on my server. I remember Hillsbrad being a 1v3 fest for my Tauren Druid.
---
I'm pretty sure OP is being (quite) sarcastic.
---
How was Naxx not part of vanilla? It was out for over 7 months before BC came out... your argument is pretty invalid imo
---
We know that, but scarab lord sill refers to the Vanilla achievement. There’s no need to be pretentious.
---
BS! "6 to 8 in one week" requires the maximum of 13000 RP in that week. You have to rank #1 in that week. Even if the server is very low pop and there's only one premade on your faction it would be very unlikely that they let you rank #1 in your first premade week.
---
"12 and 13 took 2 weeks each" the same applies here.
---
What you discribe here is only possible for one player on the server at a time and he must be a serious nolifer.
---
You know, that's fair
---
Dude....there are no secrets anymore lol. The game is a decade and a half old.
---
yes its not worth it, im not using turn keys personally. two convinient binds are more convinietnt to have.
---
I was just saying it has its uses and not completely useless, as you stated. it also depends on the class and what you do. For classes that kite, and need to walk in onу direction while looking the other its more useful. 
---
and generally speaking it has more uses in wpvp, because in wpvp it happens in the random enviroment, sometimes with unpredicatable obstacles in your pass that you need to navigate around while looking the other direction.
---
So you're telling me I can't get a guild as a casual rogue but it's easier as a resto druid? The rest are saying the opposite
---
Spamming no changes on suggestions that are clearly to make classic more like vanilla than it will inevitably be without a change is very dumb. You’re not an npc, try thinking for yourself.
---
1-60 in 4 days is achievable If you follow one of a few guides or really know your stuff
---
Thanks guys :)
---
I'm sure the majority of players are lovely but it's just the loudest voices are usually the worst, I'm sure you know how it is.
---
Getting it off my chest helped a lot.
---
This is just more "People want to look better than their peers" bullshit.
---
You have to ask yourself - what's more important to you? Aesthetics or gameplay?
---
I faced a similar conundrum and have settled for troll shaman. It kinda looks like a belf paladin if you squint really hard. Especially if you take the lore into consideration.
---
I think it's an injustice to the artists and world designers.
---
If you're a horde paladin, you are a false paladin. A blasphemer and a charlatan. So play horde and stay away from the purity of the alliance
---
There were other, more realistic art styles available they could have gone with - I'm pretty sure that it was intentional to have less than realistic graphics. Maybe it helped them to make the game more accessible to PCs with less-powerful graphic chips.
---
For me, LK really hit the spot that allowed me to become immersed in the game, it was a lot of things coming together like the northern artwork style and the overall leveling experience from 70-80, and the interactions.
---
Yeah.  The rabid classic fans seem to be some of the worst.  Especially since it'll be shown that Classic had a huge amount of flaws.  It might still be good, but people are going to realize that all the shit they talked about a lot of retail changes were really good QoL changes in the end compared to 2004.
---
Your reply is needlessly toxic. It doesn’t seem like you have any better suggestions eh? Spamming no changes on threads discussing potential solutions is easier than thinking I guess lol
---
Wasn't at all my intention to be pretentious.
---
I know a lot of people are referring to the entire chain/event as 'Scarab Lord' but I've seen quite a few people actually discussing the whole thing and specifically mentioning the title in Classic.
---
I'm also mentioning it because I didn't even realize myself that Scarab Lord wasn't a Vanilla title until about 8 or so months ago. It's easy to forget or just straight up not realize things when the game has been around so long.
---
Yeah, I look for a completely different experience in a MOBA compared to an MMORPG. Current WoW's experience is too much of a lobby-like experience for me.
---
Just chew the glass too
---
&gt;The greatest part of classic and burning crusade was that server reputation was everything. Back then you didnt server change or name change, people knew who everyone was.
---
This is a complete fabrication. This only applied to the top guilds and maybe a few select players outside of that. Nobody cared about or remembered the average player.
---
dont play till tbc classic, problem solved
---
This is not how it works. RP gain is all about the competition. The more people are commited the harder it gets.
---
They should be spawning in EPL, BRM, Silithus and Winterspring. Dunno if any other zones are included as well though
---
+bows
---
Could you get PvP rank rewards on a PvE server? 
---
I played on a PvP server back in those days, so I can't remember. 
---
If you could enable PvP on a PvE server, getting to rank 14 might be easier since there is less competition.
---
winterspring
---
I’m sorry if I came off as rude. I just don’t see what other shorthand exists for the most grand questline ever to hit WoW; it would need to be something everyone would understand, and Scarab Lord fits the mark.
---
just do all quest, starting at lvl 51. U can go close to revered with quest only
---
At this point it needs some taladril level bear druid guide and infodump to make people accept that ret doesnt suck thaaaat hard.
---
Its not so much about the money, but rather being able to put that profession I will have spent so much time on to good use. In wotlk I grinded a ton to get all JC patterns and advertised my profession multiple times a day in dalaran. Over time I built a reputation of being trustworthy and reliable. People would instantly text me when I logged in to make them gems. It was awesome. Surely I could have spent all the time farming mats and the net plus would have been 10 or 100 times of what I made. But the experience is worth so much more than gold. I dont expect to be "that guy" in Classic, but I definitely want to build a reputation. And from what I am reading, engineering doesnt offer that possibility.
---
For sure. I think referring to the whole chain as Scarab Lord is fine. It makes perfect sense.
---
I was just reminding people that the title itself won't exist in Classic since it wasn't actually part of Vanilla. Not really a necessary reminder, I'll admit, but I figured it was relevant with all the buzz about it recently.
---
Yes in a dream world where you have 37 playing decently, 3 ret paladins is completely fine. 
---
In reality you will not have 37 playing decently, because of the culture and expectations that inevitably form when you allow some members in the raid not contribute properly. As soon as someone sees low performer do fine they are asking themselves why should I work my ass off.
---
I assume this is sarcasm directed at the elitist private server tryhards here saying how things "need" to be done based on their private server escapades over the years.
---
Viable with quite good gear (Start of T3), earlier for alliance thanks to bok
---
Yea.....no lol
---
YO i know more about a game than you, that makes me cool right?! 
---
Derper prob take 2 months to get 60, just cause you know shit doesnt mean you can do it.
---
That's not a bad suggestion,  I won't have masses for time to play so was planning on focusing if all into one toon. However I am struggling to find any interest at all in other classes.
---
I would hunt myself down too if I were in your shoes. Lok'tar Ogar!
---
You would be amazed how clueless 90% of the players are sometimes.
---
I have an old screenshot from TBC of my party coming out of the Deadmines. We all look very cute in our hobo gear.
---
You just gotta group with resto druids they will love you
---
There is none. You are at a severe disadvantage by not changing a and d to strafe lol.
---
This is one of my major fears about Classic. The people who will bring their shitty live attitude of perfection or GTFO to ruin the classic experience
---
Out of interest, what class was your belf and what are you rolling in classic?
---
Lmao at all these people saying original AV = change. No changes simply means “only things that was done originally in Vanilla WoW”. 
---
...Which means OG Alterac Valley = No Changes
---
...And 1.12 AV = also No Changes
---
So angwy
---
August seems like a safe bet if you have a deadline. You may miss the initial week, but at least you have a pretty high chance (if the release date doesn't get pushed out of summer) of having 2 weeks early in the release.
---
Sadly it's the best hope for some people's deadlines.
---
Well I know my guild is going to only run with 2 hunters in raids, for that reason i'm quite happy to play hunter and barely fight for gear.
---
.....TURNCOAT!
---
/s
---
Weekends 11-3 is perfect for me because it's generally after my girlfriend is asleep and I don't have to work in the morning.
---
this made me remeber, the "we dont want no blood elf paladin video that became big in vanilla" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCem2c\_apoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCem2c_apoM)
---
It's a hard one as I feel they both impact my enjoyment almost equally. 
---
If you were originally a pally and are going for shaman, what is that made you most interested in shaman? (Could do with a different perspective on the other classes)
---
I don't think you should be able to see further than what was maximally possible in Vanilla. Otherwise you put those who want the graphics to look as original as possible at a disadvantage.
---
I'm fine with higher resolution textures, extra foliage and that sort of thing, though.
---
Legion release date was announced on April 18th, and Battle for Azeroth release was announced on April 5.
---
Surely Classic will be announced similarly ahead of time, to keep people subscribed, or to give people time to plan.
---
Battle for Azeroth release date was announced on a Thursday.
---
Therefore my tinfoil hat theory is that we will get a release date this Thursday (18th April).
---
30% hasted attacks with flurry + BT + WW + Overpower + Hamstring, how retarded do you need to be to think a Ret Pala proccs it more often?
---
what's the best tip you all have for managing my pet in battle? I tend to struggle with sending my pet in and him taking the most jank routes, pulling 500 mobs with it.
---
I loved Howling Fjord and Grizzly Hills in Wrath as well. Having family from Northern Sweden it felt extra special and more engaging than anything I've seen since. Even if the game content int he zones might not have been as memorable since by Wrath they already skewed the experience away from leveling/the world toward the merry-go-round stronger theme park focus.
---
You're a free kill to UD rogues until level 42, when you get deathcoil. After that it improves a lot.
---
Hi, /u/kidcudi93
---
Azuremyst is one of the most underrated zones of World of Warcraft, and together with Eversong Woods those two might be my favorite zones in the entire game. The atmosphere is top notch, the quests fun and the zones are designed in such a way that they feel natural and open, but also natural and mysterious.
---
1.12 warlocks are very powerful in this patch, as soul link spec you can tank your counter classes (melee) and with voidwalker sacrifice you can tank even harder and wait for your dot’s to kill them, by the time you get endgame gear you will be a pvp god, also all specs are viable in pve and pvp combined, less gold needed to respec and you get free mount and incredible lore quests
---
It was late BC for me too. 
---
I even lied about it when being asked. Until the day i've shared my Rogue PoV for our first Mother Shahraz kill in Black Temple. I've had my mouse cursor disabled in fraps but you could still see me moving over the spells because they got highlighted when you moved over them with the cursor. 
---
Was a bit embarassing getting caught lying about it and just learned it the next day.
---
&gt;Although it's been fun and I cannot wait for the release of classic, it seems like the current player base is almost completely unforgiving of any mistakes, and expects absolute perfection from anyone playing at all times. 
---
What you are seeing is the most hardcore people that have played vanilla for number of years straight. The ACTUAL classic playerbase will have loads of more people, people who havent ever played vanilla (real or in private servers like).
---
I still dont get why this opinion is so widely spread in the classic community. It is all about math. RP gain has nothing todo with how many HKs you gain but with how many HKs the others gain. Its about the competition. And to be clear: The barrier to reach rank 10 is &gt;8000 RP/week because of the decay. Only the top 6% of your faction will gain more than 8000 RP/week. This is not super doable at all without a premade group.
---
That's some good writeup. Thanks :)
---
There will be other people on their mains actively herbing the zone already though, by the time you log your level 1 out and move your own main to that spot somebody else will have picked it 99% of the time.
---
That's where you are wrong though... By the time GS was released in WoW, gear was already being thrown about all over the place. All it represents is your ability to get gear, not your ability to play the game. 
---
For example, I could have a gear Score of 15, and another guy has a gear Score of 25, but I might have all my consumables, know every fight like the back of my hand, but the defining factor is that none of it matters because my GS is 15 and theirs is 10 higher.
---
Well, charge isn't as important. The big thing to leveling would be Bite.
---
Never thought about this and sounds like correct. I mean at the end, is the sum up of all those things that makes Vanilla so special. Also is like you can really perceive the love put to deliver the best game experience at that time instead of a product to adquire the most possible income.
---
Check the protection warrior stage-6 shield
---
TeamSpeak was more popular on my server.
---
I've been playing frost mage for 14 years(which requires the most kiting), had multiple gladiator titles and many duelist titles and I have never used turning
---
So I don't think its useful
---
When you care so much about a video game, that came out 15 years ago, that you think you are a better person than people who try to have fun and dont dedicate their entire life to the game..
---
Classic is about the exact opposite of being elitist and efficient with everything you do. Really must such to miss out on the fun because you belive you are a cooler person if you tell others they are doing it wrong.
---
I echo this sentiment. Eversong Wood design and music created such an amazing atmosphere.
---
Yikes.
---
Well, it is.  You don't have to like it, but, that's how it's going to be.  I have played more than enough MMOs to see the kind of tryhard meta whores that will dominate the raiding scene, especially early on.
---
Incredible! I will use this in my guild for sure. Thank you, sir!
---
wandering round storm wind collecting anyone attuned. most chilled out raids
---
This is a big reason why i play mostly female chars, especially on all the healers. You are going to wear a dress 90% of the content. Might as well look good wearing it. 
---
And i dont mind if you think your orc male rocking a dress is sexy as fuck, each for their own.
---
He probably refered to your name being a gnome warlcok and posting about playing a mage
---
+1
---
Actually. They're just named Shaman on Horde. Easy mistake.
---
You should remain loyal to the Horde. I know exactly you feel, I'm a Ret Paladin deep down, but a proud member of the Horde first. Take classic to learn our origin classes: Priests and Warriors.
---
&gt; Majority of classic players will have never played on private servers
---
I don't buy that for a second. Maybe the first *day*, but no way the tourists will stay
---
It’s decent! Mainly pvp, but surv/mm puts out some massive hits, and major utility.
---
Gearscore came in late wrath and there was way less "wellfare" gear than today. There also was no titanforge.
---
Gearscore came in a time where Achievments were also there to back up the "I've experience" claim.
---
People with lower gearscore and no achievments are possible better than people with higjer gs and achievment. But the save pick would be highest gs and achiev. For was mostly for fast pug clears and not for progress anyway.
---
Yeah, the guild eventually split into two during TBC because there was too much friction due to the 25 man raid size not having enough room to carry 10 people who died in the first minute against Gruul and who weren’t contributing much even if they managed to survive. 
---
The core 15-20 people who had been doing all the heavy lifting since vanilla formed a dedicated raiding guild and it worked out better. The people who could never be bothered to spend five minutes of research to contribute more on raids got to do their own thing in the old guild. 
---
Not like I hated them. Just didn’t want to raid with them because they wasted my time.
---
You care so much :)
---
Repeat after me: 
---
"FROST SHOCK"
---
&gt; I'm just wondering if I can expect more of the same when classic actually releases?
---
Yes. There's lots of info about vanilla out there. If you are making the life of other 4-39 people miserable during dungeons and raids it's kinda your fault.
---
I particuarlly have way less patience than I did back then. Probably because I'm older.
---
I mean, I'm willing to reply to any questions asked, but I'm not willing to stay in a dungeon for 5 hours because the tank or the healer don't know what to do.
---
Paladins changed immensely between vanilla and TBC. Much more then other classes I've played. Warlocks just got more warlocky, druids just got more druidy but Paladins were a complete new class.
---
Try them out first to see if you still like them.
---
Vanilla warrior in a nutshell: 
---
"Oh, great new weapon upgrade, Unstoppable force from AV !"
---
"Jeesus fucking christ, my weapon skill on 2-h maces is 7".
---
Probably because you don't mess up
---
I love how they make plants and vegetation in wow, a simple texture painted on a plane with an alpha channel, and they copy the same plane then rotate it 90 degrees to fake volume... genius. 
---
Plants are a big part of the zones for me, having the little herbs on the ground, all the bushes near water ponds.... etc etc it adds to the feeling of thz zone, it renders it even better
---
A more genearl approach to this comes from understanding the difference in gear theory for PvP and PvE (raiding).
---
When gearing for PvE you mostly care about efficiency over longer periods of time. Sustained damage, sustained healing and so on. Every effect that you get from a piece of gear should be averaged over minutes, to gauge it's efficiency. Small increases in DPS/HPS etc. over longer periods have significant effects because of the nature of multiplicative scaling with buffs, world buffs, boss debuffs etc.
---
However in PvP the fights are much shorter, action packed. "On use" items have a much bigger effect there. You care less about efficiency and much more about utility, burst damage/healing, mobility, distractions and especially survivability.
---
In terms of survivability what most people overlook is magical damage mitigation via resistances. There are numerous pieces and consumables that give you +X resistances over all schools. This is very effective for PvP especially when scaling up the number of opponents and scales up very nicely with any stamina, regeneration gear and burst healing you can get.
---
In terms of utility there are plenty of different effects and items that are great in PvP specifically. For example certain "on use" items can detect stealth by applying a debuff or damage in an area, or by summoning pets. Pet summoning in general is very useful for PvP as well because it adds another layer of distraction and can prevent people from getting OOC or add casting pushback. And again, "on use" items will greatly benefit you in shorter fights because you want some advantage *right now* and not efficiency over the course of a longer period.
---
Play a PVE server. PVP servers are for WPVP
---
I really hope you are trolling or are 12 years old. You most likely never did anything of value in the game and pretend to be cool for having played on some private servers.
---
It's probably better for their servers if we don't all plan time off.
---
I remember we had a hunter spamming wing clip for ours, nothing else could compete in terms of uptime, sure it gimped the guys dps but atleast it was 100% reliable.
---
Well tbh some people use QWE as movement, Q and E strafe and W forward. ASD can be bound to macros or spells.
---
Because there is 1. Each week there is 1. Meaning you have to have THE MOST honor of every single person on your faction for that week. And now remember how many no life nerds will be competing with you for that one single spot. That's why it's so hard.
---
First of all, many pservers have pretty broken pet pathing, so alone playing on Blizzards servers might help.
---
As for actual tips, I'd suggest when you level to have your pet on passive. Find a good keybind for pet attack and pet follow. This way you are forced to get the muscle memory of deciding when your pet attacks. The good thing about this is your pet won't attack as soon as you do. So for example you can pull and kite a bit back and your pet follows you. When you fee like it is safe you can send your pet in.
---
You can also use the stay command and kite away. This way you kite backwards, but your pet stays where you put it. When the enemy is near your pet you turn on attack and growl should allow your pet to gain aggro. Effectively you can use this to make sure the pet / enemy fight is exactly where you want. It can be really useful with bigger enemies where you need to plan the fight a bit.
---
I always used to do this vanilla was rough leveling so I played the auction house on an alt and then sent myself sweet upgrades to make me push on
---
This is why I wish Blizz went for the authentic vanilla *experience* rather than authentic vanilla numbers. Part of the experience was the mystery, the adventure, and the lack of day 1 hard metas. It simply won't be as fun for as many people compared to back in the day, imo.
---
The reason they feel natural to me is because the zones are also dangerous and traveling takes a while.
---
Summer is not two months long!
---
Well, funny you asked. I went over to use almost exclusively the keyboard as a result of my mother wanting to take away my gaming privileges as a result of something (honestly cant remember what, she had a short temper). Anyway, she'd take the mouse and I'd simply use exclusively keys, and then I figured out I could do most my things exclusively with keys. Besides awkward targetting and having to keyboard turn it made me a better player. Thanks mom?
---
I am leaving the alliance behind for Horde this time around!
---
Try to get past level 50 so you won't need too much time in STV
---
You won't be getting invited to my group unless you lose that TUDE DUDE!
---
backpeddling intensifies
---
&gt;They go to FP's because that's where all the quests are, that's where people afk after landing, and ultimately people just CC or zone players until the 30 seconds end.
---
So, blizzard could just keep refreshing the 30s timer if you were CC'd or attacked during that time. Or add more guards with such range that you couldnt just sit there attacking ppl.
---
Don't forget the background music in each zone that adds to the unique feeling and open world experience.
---
We can only really talk from an anectodal perspective here because of the nature of wPvP. Yes these items can be powerful in the right hands. Especialy since most fresh 60's are simply not wearing stuff or speccing in a way that benefits them in PvP but are incremental bonuses on long-term PvE efficiency.
---
But most importantly the aggressor is always at an advantage in wPvP. If you set your mind on ganking and group with 2-3 players then you will almost always come out ahead, especially if you are coordinated and quick. Here the gear differences have a minor impact on your actual PvP performance because of the tactical advantage you have. And when things get tough, brining an additional player has a *much* bigger impact than having better gear, especially if were talking early vanilla.
---
Not to mention that you have to get X ammount of honor to get rank 14, even if you are rank 1 for the first month of the PVP season, you won't be rank 14 because you simply won't have enough honor accumulated.
---
So how about a R14 scheme where the entire faction on the server agreeing to only gain a fixed about of honor each week, and anyone who didn't agree would get right-click-reported and locked out.  
---
Maybe a "honor rigging" mod that monitored everyones honor gain and helped you find whom to right click report. (i.e. anyone not in the mod, and anyone that farms above a certain honor level).
---
The means of producing honor should belong to the one who farms! *PvP Karl Marx*   
---
Did you play on a PVE server?
---
Couldn't have put it better myself.
---
i've always needed something like this, ty so much
---
- There's only 1 per faction (so 2 per server) rank 14 per week. So you need to be the top honor for that week
---
- Even if you are the top 1 honor of your server, you still need X ammount of honor to be rank 14, so being the top 1 honor in the first month(s) won't even get you there. It's about a 3-month effort for the first guy in the server to be rank 14
---
- There's a huge honor decay between the weeks so if you don't play as much on one week, you might lose lots of progress
---
Again, achievement... I have many times boosted my less geared friend through raids, giving them achievements that they haven't earned themselves.
---
I don't know how GS or ILevel can be spun as a good thing.
---
I'd say pick whatever you have more of an alignment to, the class or the faction.  The Paladin class did change substantially between TBC and Vanilla, so you might find playing a warrior would work out just fine if you plan to DPS or Tank, however if you plan on healing I'd say try out a shaman, priest, or druid (I would probably put priest healing closer to paladins).  If you are however willing to step over to the alliance you'll have your choices of Human or Slightly shorter/stronger looking alcoholic humanoid creature known as the dorf.
---
It's a realistic goal but the last week or 2, you will have to push hard. Keep in mind classic should be easier than pservers.
---
I remember a guy on a pserver who was literally 99% into rank 9, he farmed about 200k honor and that wasn't enough to get r10, he stayed at 99% due to decay.
---
Unless i'm mistaken.. reckoning wont work like that in classic. It had an ICD put on it during one of the patches but pservers never actually implamented it.
---
I'm still salty so many of my favorite games, all using 2D pixels style, turned into 3D when the 3DS came out. Biggest disappointment was pokémon - BW had the most wonderful sprites, full of emotion and color, and they replace them with 3D models that look like dull balloons. Not to mention they lag my 3DS, *the console the games were releases for*, to the point certain battles are nearly unplayable. When graphical "quality" comes before gameplay experience, something is wrong.
---
I cared about them having fun right up until we started doing bwl and they were often dead in the first minute of every fight, or they survived the fight but did significantly less dps than the tank, or half of the people they were assigned to heal were dead because they were not good at that role. 
---
They were impacting the fun of other people because they refused to make an attempt to be better players while insisting that they deserved a raid spot. 
---
They weren’t dedicated players. They were selfish and entitled players wasting the time of people trying to make the most out of limited raid time. Many people in the guild had small children and other commitments that only allowed them to raid on the one night a week we raided, and they showed up prepared to make the most of it. Entitled people also showed up and fucked off for three hours for “fun” and actively hamstrung our progress because they didn’t give a shit about everyone else. 
---
When politely asked to be a bit more prepared, they got indignant and complained that the guild wasn’t being friendly and casual enough. Unsurprisingly they had no problem using their dkp to compete on loot. It was pretty much the only time they were paying attention during the raid
---
Yes you can. Maybe it could be even easier since theorically people that roll on PvE servers have no interest in PvP
---
I am legitimately concerned about your post history.
---
Pokemon is a great example. Red and Blue left so much to the imagination - plus the 2D graphics are timeless.
---
I dont know where the idea comes from that survival outscales MM at any point. 
---
Its just never the case and I tried on with full T3. Essentially you trade:  
---
Survival:
---
15% Agility  
---
MM:  
---
10% Damage on Multishot  
---
5% Damage flat
---
IoAtH  
---
100 AP for your \*Group\*
---
You think you do, but you don’t
---
No need for fire resist if you just SMOrc
---
its not useful in arena. i've never said it.
---
I notice you mention PvP and most people seem to answer in terms of PvE.
---
For PvP MM/SV is one of the most common specs. This is because the strength of TSA is how it applies to a group and it is a small dmg boost, but over time with constant damage (like in a PvE fight) it matters. For PvP something like more crit works better because one crit can turn the fight. This is why SV talents like Killer Instinct or even Lightning Reflexes can be great in PvP. Furthermore, SV obviously have several utility that lend themselves to a PvP fight, like Deterrence or Counterattack.
---
Hunters are lucky in how many specs they have. Many people have found success with deep SV (meaning 30 points, you want Scatter Shot instead of Wyvern Sting) and many like to go 20 or sometimes 21 for Counterattack in SV. The rest always goes to MM, since you need Aimed Shot and then it's better to just keep going for Scatter Shot. The deep SV is mostly for when you have better gear and LR grants more, but you don't need nearly as much agility as in PvE. Often in PvP you will not be able to gain full benefit from TSA sharing in a group (as you might be alone, or grouped with casters). This favors SV.
---
&gt; ASD can be bound to macros or spells.
---
So can QES
---
You should write a post too!
---
Hahahaha, XD what a fresh meme
---
&gt; There's actually a mechanical loss to gameplay by binding strafe to a and d, to do with hit boxes, and server response but I've been down voted to hell when trying to explain it in the past.
---
How changing a keybind affects server response? Wtf?
---
If you are one of the people who have 1-2 hours to play after work, gl questing with the currently proposed system. It will take you one hour to reach your quest destination, you might be lucky to get few mobs before the rank farming zerg rolls around. Regards, loser neet.
---
Priest: "Yarr, I'm stoned af"
---
Guns guns guns GUNS!!
---
No refunds
---
From my experience you it's easier to try another class/race than to betray your home faction.
---
For the Horde!
---
Yeah clique caused me a major setback during TBC. Being able to heal with just your mouse as a druid was pretty incredible. I miss rolling lifeblooms.
---
Also someone said it changes at T2.5. Some t2.5 parts are just plain bad.  
---
Spending itemization points on spelldamage and an arcane shot set bonus is questionable at best.
---
I use mouse thumb button 1 to attack/dash/taunt and 2 for follow/stop attack/dash 
---
Most mouses have 2 thumb buttons. 
---
To add more utility for those buttons, alt+button 1 to aspec of cheetah, alt + button 2 to aspec of hawk
---
Damn, 1 week break between expansions.  Not much time to refresh from burnout.
---
It’s not going to be this summer my dude. Probably going to be late fall or winter
---
It doesn't outscale to roughly 1000agi.

You make it sound like you only think whats best for the casuals, but still accepting the fact you will be out there hunting them down for honor, maximizing your efficiency trough them no matter what kind of implementation will happen.
---
I think phase 3 WSG is better because both the casual and hardcore players start playing the battlegrounds on the same date.
---
The world pvp experience might end up like you described, or it might not. I'd rather like to see you hardcore people out there showing everyone the beauty of pvp realms (mowing people down with no mercy) than be cooped up in the battlegrounds right from the start. 
---
You are a part of the world (of warcraft) just like anyone else, and we shouldn't try to move these groups of players apart from each other.
---
If it's anything like pservers, you can knock out exalted the first weekend with some serious neckbearding.
---
It'll highly depend on the AV "meta" for classic though - will horde be able to wall jump? How easy can alliance slip into horde territory? If both sides are zerging content instead of turtling matches will be over in 20 min or less.
---
I've played both ret and fury wwarrior on pservers, saying that paladins are just aa bots have no clue. Warriors have 2 buttons they press every 8 sec, and spam heroic strike/execute if the moment allows them.
---
Ret paladins have 2 seals, judgment (to then refresh seal) and conc spam. Fill with hammer of wrath at 20%. 
---
They are very similar in "buttons to press".
---
Warriors also have utlity like stance dance, shieldwall, tanking.
---
Paladins also have cleane, healing, bop, freedom etc. (in naxx they have exocism aswell)
---
LUINWE FOR PRESIDEn!!!!!!!!!!
---
According to the census data from this subreddit, 70 percent of players intending to play Classic have played on a private server.
---
I am not looking forward to servers where almost three quarters of the server are hardcore and willing to break the ToU... ...that is my major concern.
---
The only time I use turn left or turn right is while channeling to Hearthstone because the silly spinning in place amuses me. So A and D can easily just be strafe buttons.
---
Personally I have moved my movement keys one key to the left, ESDF, rather than WASD. This gives me more button options I can reach. (May require large hands for profit)
---
"Your" Paladin class is not the same as your vanilla counterpart.
---
Pick a new class, might I suggest a shaman.
---
I've had the exact same experience and I rarely make mistakes but I see it directed at other players all the time and it's sickening. It goes against the spirit of vanilla completely. 
---
Your best bet is to find out which servers the private server players will be playing on and avoid them like the plague.
---
Coming from league of legends, I started WoW during the beginning of wrath in 2009.  I never once clicked a spell from my first toon onward until I quit in early legion, my night elf warrior had everything bound and shift/alt variants
---
After 14yrs of "Horde is best!" posts across various community sites, I suspect it's going to be the Alliance who will be the minority faction on a lot of servers.
---
Yeah I don't remember there being only 2 battlemasters either so I went looking for the relevant patch notes! To be fair to us both, it was a long time ago.
---
he said second best? and it's true, with seal of righteousness, paladins get 2x the chance on each swing to proc it
---
Could someone tell me how to read this?? Kind of in detail? Idk really know how to read spread sheets
---
If you want hop on a private server test the waters on the better side-I mean the regular equally good alliance. But really lol just try leveling a pally on ally to 10 or so and then a horde of your choice see which one you like more.
---
Stay out of Winterspring!
---
If you turn ambience, music, sound on etc. it’s eery how nice the game world feels. 
---
You can be alone in the world in classic and it feels like you’re still on a grand adventure. 
---
Modern MMO’s are too focused on monetization and it creates this overstimulation and all of these checkboxes that the developers feel they need to touch upon so that the “consumer isn’t dissappointed.” All of those QoL changes from TBC and beyond have turned into the mainstay for MMO’s, they go and try to copy the things that WoW did wrong, the things that ruined the vanilla experience.
---
yeah this is how i imagined it would be.  i remember it being nerfed to have a max # of stacks but i cant remember anything beyond that as i played a rogue at the time
---
Opportunity Loss is through the roof on this one.
---
Feint, son. Feint.
---
Has there been much news recently? I’m anxiously awaiting classic but trying to hide myself from details at the moment as I know it could consume me!
---
I whatched some PvP video where the warlock was running from a rogue I think, and his Nightfall procc happened, he jumped, did a 180º, shadowbolted the rogue, 180º again in the air and landed still runnin on the same direction, away from the rogue.
---
It was the most awesome thing I've ever seen in WoW, skill-wise lol. I ditched my clicking in that same week. Struggled a lot trying to remember the keys etc, but I do not regret that.
---
The mobility you get from binding and mouse turning basically transforms WoW in a whole different and way more dynamic and fun game.
---
&gt; I've played both ret and fury wwarrior on pservers, saying that paladins are just aa bots have no clue. Warriors have 2 buttons they press every 8 sec, and spam heroic strike/execute if the moment allows them.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Ret paladins have 2 seals, judgment (to then refresh seal) and conc spam. Fill with hammer of wrath at 20%.

---
This is copied response from my comment to another guy lower down
---
Yeah this is exactly what I've been hearing. But at least it sounds like I'd have a place in all the content regardless of the community opinion, which is the only concern I had. Thanks
---
what a productive comment, yea you never need to swap your gear, or browse atlas or your bags, while moving on the curvy road or an enviroment with obstacles and turns. (for instance on the road to diremaul).
---
I meant that you are currently browsing /r/classicwow not /r/wow, so this post has nothing to do with current (retail) wow, and your comment has nothing to do with this post.
---
I bind caps lock to reverse camera (look behind you) because you always end up pressing it again and turning caps off.  And it's nice to be able to see what's chasing you while running away.
---
The problem is due to pservers people mostly just compare how classes are at AQ40 or even Naxx gear. This is totally unrealistic for most people and honestly far away into the future. They forget that during any xpac of WoW, the meta changes. It also changed during vanilla, but people just look at the final meta of vanilla and compare classes based on that.
---
But as you say, hunters are in the nice state of having a good amount of raids where they are strong in, utility to stay relevant afterwards and being great in PvP. Honestly, coupled with easy leveling, great gold farmers and best class for doing most solo things, it is more than anyone could ask for in terms of viability from a single class.
---
I'm not sure. I like the vanilla zones for how they really just feel like actual big areas, and then someone populated them later with mobs, quests, and stuff. There is a lot of dead space, which makes the world feel bigger. In retail pretty much every inch of space is used for some purpose, and you can tell that as a player. You often even see how they have tried to cram in as much stuff as possible in a small area. 
---
But with that said, Warlords of Draenor actually has my all time favorite WoW zones. Because they managed to somewhat hide the bad parts about the modern zone design, and then everything else is just really good, not just graphically, but quests, lore, and so on.
---
Great!
---
Have played alot of horde at the end of vanilla and during tbc though. So i’m not exactly in the same situation as OP
---
For sure. Purge is generally strong in PvP. If I was Horde I would roll a Shaman.
---
This sounds petty I know, but I decided on rolling Rogue over Fury Warrior purely because I can wear tier sets as a rogue instead of those dreadful power ranger AQ shoulders and mismatches horrible gear which is BiS for fury. L:(
---
To be fair I was always top of warrior DPS metres in the raids I did do with arms
---
Right?
---
You must be so good, I'd love to watch a pvp video
---
I started playing on symmetry earlier in the month. Working on a rogue for a trial run
---
When hunter starts to fall back in performance? After 1 year of classic release? 
---
Hunter is going to be the strongest ranger dps when the game comes out, probably same level as mage and lock in full btw gear. In pvp same thing, with T1 and no honor system, and even later with honor system but no bgs, hunter is going to be very strong in pvp. 
---
To make it short, most players will get bored of hunter before it underperforms
---
Think we have different definitions of elitist.
---
I can feel you. Paladin is an awesome class, and ever since switching to Horde sometime in Vanilla I'm "Horde4Life" as well, but it looks like I'll get "forced" to play Alliance anyway because of my friends. I think if I were you I'd go for another Mainclass on Horde and create a Paladin alt anywhere to statisfy my need for playing paladin ;)
---
Well every button is moonfire so doesn’t matter where you click
---
It won't really take a lot longer. Having 2-3 memespecs in the raid playing as well as they can, will reduce overall raid dps by perhaps 2-4%. So the actual raid clear times would maybe be reduced by 1% if you factor in time spent waiting around/running to places within the raid.
---
Sorry, but we don't allow recommendations of private servers here (Rule #4). Please try r/wowservers for private server discussion.
---
We've gotten a blue post at least once a week for the past 4-5 weeks. Most recent post was on this past Monday.
---
Why will people get bored of hunters? Just curious

I've advocated this thought several times in hunter threads. The problem is many people just calculate when LR grants more AP than TSA does for the combined group and call it the threshold. As you say, there are several other talents you need to account for, and many does not even account for the crit granted by LR.
---
For most people it is best to not think about it.
---
But that's still bad :(
---
one of the biggest things the classic team needs to get right is the weather effects. Vanilla had some serious rain storms. like torrential downpours.
---
Post removed as a troll post.

On Mal'ganis, people knew who people were. That was my experience anyway.
---
&gt;veterans and newbies alike, will be starting from square one, running around looking like fucking scrubs
---
"no scrub A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me"
---
&gt; Having 2-3 memespecs in the raid playing as well as they can
---
Contradiction. But you clearly didn't read what I said. You are talking about the dreamworld scenario where you only have 3 people slacking for some reason.
---
This is actually not correct, I remember reading about this some time ago so did some digging.
---
The ability to select your displayed title wasn't added until TBC. Before then, the PvP rank titles would just override it by default.
---
According to this [link](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Talk:Scarab_Lord) it was added in patch 1.9.
---
This is a very interesting observation. Thank you for this insight. This is very useful to me!
---
Even the meme moonfire spam needs some good movement and mouse turning :p

you lost me

When you got your new Naga, was it another gen 1 or did you get the newer one? I have a gen 1 naga molten that is starting to "wiggle" a little and I'm worried I'm about to have to replace it. I've felt the new ones and while they still have all the buttons, the feel of the mouse is totally different to me.
---
Trivialize MC/BWL maybe. AQ and Naxx will still be rough for 95% of the playerbase.
---
Go shaman.
---
They are actually fun and have totems in vanilla, as opposed to retail
---
Pretty big difference between "I recognize some names" and "Reputation is everything"
---
Already my Classic experience will differ from vanilla (as if it won’t in so many other ways too, which is fine) - this time I will have a second monitor, likely with r/classicwow up while I play.
---
You can bring back old content and old dungeons and old raids.. but you can't bring back how gaming was 10-15 years ago. In the day and age of Fortnite, DOTA, LOL and all that stuff, people are way more toxic and need the instant dopamine hits that success brings and blame anyone but themselves if things go wrong.
---
Also bear in mind that classic pservers in some form or another have been around since the end of the original classic. This means that although they may not be perfect, people have known about optimal builds and gearing strategies for years, whereas originally it was a step into the unknown for everyone and in turn this led to mismatched talent builds and odd gearing choices. 
---
I'm sure there will be many nice people you will meet but also I think it is likely there will be many elitist and flamey types as well who go berserk at the smallest mistakes because you derailed their perfect 1-60 in 3 days plan. :D
---
Who doesn’t use mouse to move?
---
As a tank in 5 mans I generally have two rules. Stay behind me and let me pull. CC your target if that’s your job. You follow those two things I’ll never give you a hard time.
---
Its always the same 4 zones.  I dont recall them off the top of my head
---
Yup, I wasnt aware user names had to be factual.  My bad.
---
Have to disagree about charge for leveling. Will agree that you don't need the highest rank. Reason charge is so useful for leveling is that it's FAST. You don't wait for your pet to casually wander up to your target and slowly grab aggro. Instead, your pet zips right to the target and has aggro NOW. As for pet DPS, that a fairly minor consideration IMO. Just remember that leveling speed is proportional to kills per hour. Not how long it takes for an individual kill. But honestly, in the long run, it doesn't matter which pet you use. I would strongly recommend trying at least one pet from each of the three types and see which you enjoy most.
---
Lupos was patched out relatively early, along with pet resists and pet run speed.  If it's true to 1.12, the only unique mob statistic that will carry over is attack speed.  It's worth noting that it was broken in the demo (all pets were 2.0 attack speed).
---
There honestly won't be "one \[X\] to rule them all" simply because no pet is actually going to make that much of a difference.  However, the general consensus is...
---
Cat (Broken tooth preferable for pvp)
---
Wolf (for buff in pve)
---
Wind Serpent (for nature damage physical attack in pve)
---
But most things are viable in pve.  In PvP the only pet attribute that really matters is a fast attack speed for fighting casters (other than having dive/dash but honestly, almost no one ever uses a pet without one that).  For that, Brokentooth is, indeed, the best bet.  1.0 attack speed, plus prowl (especially if you're a filthy night elf).  The down side being that he's level 37, highly sought after, and an extremely long spawn.  If you're on a pvp server, getting him is going to be an unbelievable nightmare, and getting him \*at level\* on a pvp server is pretty much impossible.  Leveling a pet from 37 if you're already 60 is a herculean task.  It will only get xp off of mobs that give you xp, and your ability to solo will more or less disappear when your pet is 14 levels below the minimum mobs that can give you xp.  I only ever got BT once, and it was on a private server, and only because russian hackers were crashing the server every 20 minutes. 
---
If you don't want the effort of BT, there are easily obtainable 1.2 attack speed cats in the high 20's, and once ZG hits, the bats there have a 1.0 attack speed.
---
  Personally, I always loved the ZG bat, and will be rocking one of them.  It may lose its super fast run speed, but it has a 1.0 attack speed, and starts at level 60, and can be gotten on demand once ZG hits.
---
Because only a Warlock would be edgy enough to comment on a post that doesn't pertain to him at all. I kid. We are all desperate for Classic so the more the merrier.
---
&gt;TLDR: Current private server playerbase is indimidating and toxic  towards newer or less skilled players, hoping classic will be a bit more  forgiving.
---
As a retail player, that started in Legion pre-patch I can say I went to check it out and found it be the opposite -  [https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624152675](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624152675) \- people talk to each other, say "thanks" a lot, especially if you save someone from inevitable doom or drop a buff :) Oh, and I ended up as the Wailing Caverns guide on my like 3rd or 4th visit there - so either private server players are bad at navigation elitists or just your local friendly WoW players that play it for fun ;)
---
Not to mention that the small tryhard group will be quite beneficial to others as those will be the first people to buy deviate fish from level 12 Timmy fishing in the Barrens and so forth :)
---
I would wait and see before deciding if it's realistic or not. Just have fun collecting some honour up to like rank 5 or 6 and then decide if it's possible. 
---
Keep in mind that the decay you experience at rank 9 is over twice that of rank 5 while your cap remains the same. So you really have to grind a lot by then.
---
Technically this is part of research, which is still ongoing.. much of the research has been on ALL classes and how to level them and playstyle at 60 and viability/optimization arguments. But feedback from COMPETITIVE players in PvP is Generally run the flag and spin a base in AB. And raiding sounded like we're the worst healer due to how slow HT cast is(others will have reacted and healed them before we can and rejuv is not stackable leading to very low resto druid demand). I can live with the above.. not being optimal. It's the community perception that concerns me and this thread was a small sample size of responses that indicate whether there is a stigma around bringing a druid or if I'd have a place among competitive players.  
---
I don't want to play casually and I can't PvP competitively without gear from pve so I wanted to get some responses on how others view them. And it seems everyone here is saying they are viable and are very open minded about them which I suppose is enough to get through the content needed to be competitive in PvP.
---
PvP
---
Definitely! I've got a few I have to make before then (warrior, then hunter), but it'd be super helpful if you suggested what iconic mage helm/weapon you think I should use!
---
It's not self contradicting. Playing as well as they can within their memespecs is obviously what i meant. Either way, having a few memespecs will only have a very very minimal effect on clear times, not "a lot longer" like you said. Having said that, i still understand perfectly well why some guilds don't want to take them, i have no problem with it at all, just telling you the facts :)
---
I hate the modern design way. I want to play in a world. World's aren't conveniently laid out the way you want. Sure Darkshire and Darkshore are a PITA to navigate but they're also very atmospheric to compensate.
---
This is a good "rule" to follow if there was ever future content. Design the world first as you want it to look. Shoe-horn the content in after.
---
Also the fact pets get absolutely mauled in vanilla by boss AoE, dont scale with gear, and mend pet was channeled(not sure if this changed by late vanilla or TBC).
---
My friends and I were ally in Vanilla and off and on past that. It was a very hard decision and we eventually just flipped coins to see which side we'd go. All four of us flipped, tied twice, the third flip ended 3-1 heads. FOR THE HORDE!
---
Right on! If you need a version with better dimensions for your monitor just let me know!
---
Thank you! And will do :)
---
kings honor friend
---
I don't think we got a Blue post last week, did we?
---
I played up to and Including BWL in vanilla, and Raided Naxx on a pserver.  There was a bit of eliteism when I was raiding Naxx on the pserver, but i never got that in retail.  I was actually barred from several raids, docked dkp and put on alt status for a month for accidentally bubbling at the wrong time... we're talking a difference of a few seconds here!!! When I appealed to my friends to tell them how dumb that was they just replied with a trollie "Get Gud". I'm gonna say that it also depends a lot on the group and how far they plan to progress.  My retail buddies never got past BWL and I believe this had a lot to do with no sense of urgency.  Maybe don't align yourself with groups that dock you DKP or kick you from raid for making a mistake, but don't keep yourself in a guild that doesn't test your skills(unless you're fine with that).
---
I hope so. I have played both sides and love the Alliance easthetic. Though the wild expanse of The Barrens was nice.
---
You can just change the view distance in settings so it doesn't really matter if they implement it
---
Thanks! And I will definitely add Druid to the list, what weapon do you think is iconic enough for Druids to have under the helm?
---
They're very rare. To reliably farm them you need 2-3 people canvasing a zone for 1.5+ hours, depending on your luck, and preferably other groups to keep track of spawn timers in other zones. Its not really for the faint of heart so I'd recommend buying lotus at pricepoints you find reasonable.
---
Especially in the island near booty bay had huge downpours.
---
I made an account on a private vanilla server and realized disengage didn't launch me back but instead just did some weird spin... Was the back jump only added in. TBC or something?
---
I have a mouse with 12 buttons so I can mess with this alot, thanks!
---
I think you got a better idea of what I was asking than others. Thanks for response! I'm okay with being mid pack on pve but want to be competitive on PvP. But everyone needs a Flag Carrier so I think I'm fine there. :). I'm excited now! 
---
Go swipe to your hearts content sir. Good luck!
---
Yeah I was replying to "Is MM still PvE dps and Beast for PvP". Beast Mastery being the prime PvP spec only came about when Beastial Wrath was changed to have the Hunter also enrage rather than just the pet.
---
Like I said, if it doesn't specify then it should be all.
---
I think you might be overlooking how long phase 1 will be going. I wouldn't be suprised if it was over 6 months long. If we assume a casual player to play 2h a day on average (keep in mind that could mean 0 hours in the week and 7h a day on the weekend), then they will reach 60 in about 4 months (if we assume 10 ingame days lvling time). After that they'll have multiple months to clear dungeons and raids, get their mounts etc. So I really don't think there is gonna be that much lvl 48 farming going on in phase 2.
---
It’s pretty simple your new you suck?? Just roll alliance mr.
---
What are you basing this on? Do you have a database that has the specific armor values of every boss from 1.12? AFAIK that data was not available which is why private servers gave elite boss mobs a flat armor value.
---
I get what you're saying with a debuff slot being occupied by -200 armor for the whole raid is good, but did the original BRE stack with annihilator/bashguuder?
---
I remember it was really bad in the early days. The Alliance was the real horde. The situation did improve over time.
---
I just hope the try hard min max attitude doesn’t become the general attitude, you know? That it stays secluded to the higher tier of players. 
---
I also hope after 2-3 years, they can try to rebalance some of the specs and add some new content on a couple servers. Im all for no changes for the first 2 or so years (maybe 6-12 months of Naxx). Then after, make some balancing patches with some content. The truth is that Vanilla WoW was an _iterative_ process and that trying to snapshot that iterative process and FOREVER preserve it is just not going to work and isn’t even authentic.
---
Yes, Eversong woods is the perfect zone for a fantasy mmorpg.  Silvermoon City fits right in, and the Isle of Quel'danas is the perfecet compliment.   
---
I absolutely love ghostlands, but the dreary color palette wears on you a bit.
---
That first part is relieving, really hurt my self esteem when getting kicked from groups because my pet ran 10 miles away form what I wanted it to run to, pulling everything with it. I always had my pet on follow so I'll have to try out passive, that method sounds a ton better, thanks so much for the detailed response, stuff like this is gonna get me through the grind to 60 much smoother.
---
Okay, this is similar to info I'd found but I was mostly concerned about being accepted in pvp competitively but I think if I FC then they have to take me with them to AB haha so hopefully it goes well. Thanks for response and suggestions!
---
The reason I stopped playing private servers was because I did find that there were a lot of people that were very tight and it wasn't easy to befriend them as they all had been playing together for years on the same project's servers. (Also a lot of assholes that refused to help you but expected you to always be there for them)
---
I'm sure this won't be a larger issue in Classic apart from guilds that roll the same server. But for ever guild that has played for years there will be another one that's completely new and seeking a fresh community! Also remember that this will be official Blizzard so there will be a ton of people that haven't played ever or just came back after years of hiatus, I wouldn't worry about it too much!
---
The moment when you hit lvl 58 and knew you could start the expansion was a pretty great moment. I also loved taking alts through TBC zones.
---
2.0 was vanilla...
---
Oldschooler here, 33 , I plan on doing a lot more fishing than I do raiding. I'll help out noobs where I can!
---
twink items
---
It definitely doesn't, but neither does alchemy/enchanting/blacksmithing if you can't get the raid recipes. They are extremely rare so guilds will usually give them to an officer. You can't really grind your way to those recipes since they are BoP drops in raids. Imo it's one of the negative things about vanilla.
---
O I can imagine this
---
So this subreddit is probably the worst place to have my opinion but I have to give a hard disagree on Classic Azeroth versus Retail Azeroth. 
---
Retail Azeroth’s look is just lightyears more immersive than Classic’s Azeroth. Even a place like the Barrens looks incredible on retail compared to Classic. 
---
People probably don’t appreciate it too much cause flying mounts take it all away. After all there isn’t much to see when you are hundreds of yards above the surface. But when you take a walk like I do on Roleplaying Servers, it’s a complete different ball game. 
---
Retail gets a bunch of flak here for what’s it become. But if there is something blizzard 99.9% of the time get right is the art department and their dedication to bring some of our favorite places to life.
---
If anything private server players are welcoming of newer players.
---
I'm just thinking in terms of math here. How can people in a 40 man raid reliably all turn up being flasked if black lotus is this rare? Does this mean most guilds are just going to have their key members like healers and tank flasked up from buying on the AH and that's it?
---
theres plenty of mobs you can grind to get that first 100g with, tigers in stv for example drop grays that vendor for lots
---
Arms is fine damage wise, fury is just better.
---
Seeing as we're going to be in 1.12 talents/balance for presumably the entire time, I don't think it's unfair to analyze classes on the vanilla "final meta," as 1.12 is pretty much that.
---
Thank Christ I'm only planning to try for r12 for those shaman boots and legs.
---
Are you on ndale and alliance? Because that server got wrecked during the PvP phase introduction. There were more alliance, with better pvpers, so long story short, massive horde pops quit due to being farmed in the world relentlessly. So the imbalance is even worse on there, since horde either quit or rerolled alliance. So you're on a large private server, but it's insanely unbalanced in regards to factions, which were a result of the way they released PvP on there.
---
Eh, most people prioritize hitting 60 first, and level 48+ players give level 60s honor, so it's quite easy to camp places like Un'goro, Felwood, Searing Gorge, etc.
---
For a long time in vanilla threat was a bigger issue than it is in 1.12.  This meant that hunters with FD and rogues with feint(sp?)/vanish were at a large advantage over classes that had basically no abilities to reset their threat (fury warriors, locks, mages?).  So for most of vanilla hunters performed just fine although they obviously would have had issues by naxx (threat was changed by then and hunters would scale at their worst at this point).  That lasted maybe half a year?  Then TBC was glorious ...
---
I agree as well, even a "Phase 2.5" would be a welcome compromise.
---
So are BM pvp hunters not really a thing then?
---
I have a belf hunter, rogue and death knight. Rolling undead rogue in classic
---
That 1% playerbase will completely ruin the experience for most players, though, so this post is not intended to cater towards those players. It's to keep server populations healthy &amp; stable through Phase 2, which means maintaining a strong casual playerbase.
---
Classes also performed a lot better overall. I heard a lot of 2.0 changes were meant for Vanilla, but it was so close to BC that they held off.
---
Didn't they already confirm this will be using the new graphics engine?
---
Ah, mistook it for the subreddit from the post above. Nevermind me then.
---
i'm curious which blue items are bis until naxx?
---
Never understood why people liked Vanilla Ret.  It was like watching paint dry and did garbage damage.
---
Ah, i see you must have missed the pserver barrens chat.  On a real note though, I've seen both extremes - and i mean EXTREMES - on private servers.
---
No Transmog and few Graveyards are the only two things that really irk me about vanilla WoW. :S
---
But looking like a clown who raided several costume shops on a sugar high is a price i'm willing to pay. :p
---
The playing field will not be even; levelers will not be grouping up to try to fight people who've been clearing MC since week 2. They will outgear, have consumables &amp; engineering, epic mounts and be generally* better at the game. 
---
It's *not* going to be like it was in Vanilla. Said rankers will still be out in the World doing PvP, but instead just inbetween queues. What does adding WSG one phase earlier hurt? The honor system was only out for 50 days in Vanilla before WSG &amp; AV were both added.
---
Im not sure farming in STVietnam is gonna happen lol
---
&gt;*Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well*
---
Having said that, Mario party/cart I always pick wario
---
interestingly, warrior flurry procs off "melee critical strikes" so it explicity states it there
---
though i'd assume that the opposite of a "melee" critical strike is a ranged crit, so i still dont know if it would make sense for spells to proc it
---
we need esfand in here lol
---
I'm not talking about at launch. I'm talking about today. You log on one of them that has been around for a couple years and there are still 30 people in the starting zone doing quests
---
Bit of a follow up. There's only one time that I remember where the pet I was using actually mattered. It was during WotLK. There was an elite mob that I needed to kill and that mob was totally destroying my bear. So I went and tamed a turtle. With the turtle and it's incredible survivability, I was able to kill the elite. But that was a one time good deal and I got rid of the turtle shortly afterwards since it was just too slow and annoying to use.
---
Depends on the server size. The 'brackets' are broken up by the % of the server population that have had 15 honor kills for the week. This is obviously broken up by horde &amp; alliance. So if they allow servers to be big enough and both Alliance and Horde have enough people that get at least 15 hks in a week, you can have more than one.
---
im here for the memes mostly ;D
---
Ret Paladin is not bad at all in dungeons. 
---
While leveling, Ret will crush most casters due to how bad some of the spell ranks scale.
---
I dont think so. I think many horde players will be alliance in classic because A LOT of horde people play blood elf and think the horde races in classic look ugly
---
Hey, I got this reference !
---
It's just as good to farm low-mid level 50 players as it is to farm 60s; the lower level players are easier to farm. Just the FP won't be camped, we'll be roaming the zone too when things slow down a bit. 
---
There will also be way more than 5 private server Guilds on Classic, I can guarantee you that.
---
No problem. Just to clarify, passive is the stance, follow is not a stance. So you put on passive and use attack and follow to make your pet either run to your enemy or run back to you, always on passive.
---
A tip is using the mouse scroll wheel for attack / follow. This way you can keep kiting and during your rotation while micro-managing your pet. I often send my pet to the enemy, but before it reaches I make it follow. I then keep altering attack and follow to keep my pet close to the enemy while also kiting and during my attacks. When I then want to I know the pet can instantly attack and growl to gain aggro with no travel time. Just an example, but in general you want to keybind so you can micro manage your pet while *also* kiting and using your abilities.
---
Elitist generally has the connotation of toxicity though.  And that makes sense because it's more a view of superiority rather than having an abundance of talent.  Superiority breeds contempt.
---
NPC name is Interrogator Vishas if I remember correctly!
---
its just an example, theres a lot more.
---
You didn't use Overpower as a fury?
---
The premise/idea of BullDog was to reduce the honor of characters below level 60. If you would cut it down significantly, lot of people would just stay at level 59 in order to avoid giving 60s much honor.
---
In turn they would become less desirable to be killed and the gankers would focus on killing 60s more. 
---
Hence sub 60 would just game the system by refusing to level up.
---
Something to a similar extent (refusing to level up) was done on K3:
---
The alliance had only one group opening BGs and these were brutal. So rankers would sit at level 59 and rank there, because they earned more honor than 60s. In the end they had to reduce honor given to sub60s in order to make 60 the best BG to rank in.
---
At the end of the day, STV will still be STV and Hillsbrad will still be Hillsbrad. I'm mostly concerned with players quitting level 48+ as they're farmed daily. Ranking these days is much more min-maxed than it was back in the day and it's all about efficiency now.
---
Well said though.
---
Agreed, this will help nurture World PvP in Ashenvable and the Barrens inbetween queues; both for level 60s and those still leveling.
---
something like this once happened on a large scale on original Planetside, called The Great ATV Race
---
literally hundreds of people showed up from all 3 factions and started the race across the continent.  I got off to a good start and was ahead of most of the pack... and died almost immediately because some trolls had mined the shit out of the road lol
---
i love events like this though, its just cool to be a part of something so big and rare
---
ran into a resto Druid like that the other day, we were in ZG waiting for our 20 man to fill up and this guy just tears into a ret paladin, telling him he’s stupid and should play holy(and not taking no thanks I like retribution, as an answer) and how he doesn’t wanna wipe because scrubs (this was a fucking pug) . 
---
In the end many people end up leaving the raid before we pull, because this one douche canoe is legit harassing half the raid because he lost his mind someone would fucking play ret in HIS WORLD OR WARCRAFT. Honestly those people SUCK the fun out of the game super quickly.
---
You ain't getting downvoted here, it's a free forum anyone can say anything after all aesthetics is something very personal and not universal across humanity. It is all about perspective.
---
As I plan to main a Warlock in classic, I welcome all Paladins who cast Salv on me!
---
Thank you, this is literally what it's going to be like and I feel a lot of people don't realize it. I know on some private servers with one dominant faction, the other side practically died since so many people quit because they literally couldn't do anything in any level 48+ zone.
---
The actual leap back from disengage was added in wotlk
---
Barrens chat is a meme and people go out of their way to be as obnoxious and annoying as possible. Doesnt mean players are actually like this when you interact with them in a different setting.
---
Simply Vanillia WoW was a world. Modern retail is just a game :/ The magic is gone.
---
When I was going hard back then and ranked from 5 to 6, I was more than halfway through the 6-7 grind. When I ranked out of 6 I had just enough to get me rank 8. I was also on a medium pop server so there was like 1, maybe 2 premades at best per faction so the competition wasn't that fierce. Cross-realm BG's got introduced when I was around rank 10 or 11 so the 12-13 grind wasn't that bad.
---
Well, furies' priority list is also there: BT, WW, HS/cleave to dupe rage with maybe OP if  it is worth. And ofc, hamstring fishing for procs and execute spam when possible.  Not tecnically a rotation but still more complex than the X-bolt spam.
---
It has nothing to do with carebears or crybabies. I have to assume you haven't played Vanilla since 2005-2006, you will be changing your tune very quickly come Phase 2.
---
Private server players understand the game &amp; meta better, will have more gear, epic mounts, etc. It's not going to be a level playing field. People will still be farming honor in World PvP to rank, just a bit less since it'll be inbetween queues. The tradeoff is the servers population won't nosedive during Phase 2; world PvP won't take much of a hit, especially below level 50 brackets.
---
My friends who never played classic wow are convinced we can get R14 "easily", LOL. 
---
We are all grown now, with families and careers. There is absolutely no way, I know this to be true. But they have no idea what it kind of grind it takes to get r14, it's almost unreal. I don't think I ever made it past r7 or so, I was close to being able to get some of the pvp gear but was never able to actually get it, just close.
---
Seeing a R14 is a rarity, let them have that super OP weapon... you may only run into 5 R14's your entire play time on official classic servers.
---
Yep, in vanilla your only escape options were trap, cheetah, intimidation, scatter shot, imp wing clip.
---
Yeeeees, but that literally solves the problem of honor farming at the flight points.
---
Yeah that's the most reliable way.
---
Those are your words, not mine. I remain steadfast about what I said.
---
That doesn't matter because the biggest reason for the meta changes is gear. In vanilla some classes scaled a lot with gear (like a warrior) and some gained way less from it (like hunters).
---
I'm not even thinking about the shitshow that was early talents, I'm solely talking about how scaling works.
---
The "final meta" is not 1.12, it is Naxx gear. Since we will have a release schedule it is then not fair to judge classes based on Naxx gear.
---
Game designers all across the industry could learn a lot from this one single comment.
---
Yep and they seem more and more coming out of the woodwork since everything in classic has been "solved" so nobody wants that feeling of knowing nothing and experimenting again.
---
I still remember to this day my first grey mail helmet and shoulders and Duskwood and Deadmines after so many rerolls playing other classes I never really got past lvl20, it was like getting an epic
---
So play a shaman paladin of the horde. Then if it rolls to Tbc make a belf pally.
---
I've seen a lot of "git gud" posts here, where people expect people to be 100% up to date on what is factual correct on Vanilla WoW.
---
Which is so far from what it used to be... It used to be an unknown entity, where you got sucked into the world. Now it's all about min/max'ing. And if you don't know your shit, you are gonna be spat on...
---
Turn, not move.
---
Usually clickers won't be able to use mouse to turn because, well, they are clickign spells
---
I compared it to the top healing mace in bwl, since that's sorta when we could expect players hitting rank 14 with current timeline. In my pserver guild, where we still hold top NA speed clears for below and stuff, I went from brd mace -&gt; lokamir, a little before I hit rank 13, fwiw. Lokamir isn't some unobtainable weapon lol.
---
Then you say why would only dps get rank 14 weps? Not sure what you mean here. I literally said people that typically don't go rank 14 will be going for it, since the healing mace is so op. I wasn't better than lokimir, a top weapon for the time.
---
Honestly man it's hard to understand what you're saying.
---
Not many Blue posts but threads about wow classic from community about thousands ^^
---
World PvP will still be what it was, just a little bit less in the level 50+ brackets. WSG will have a minimal effect on any of the lower brackets probably.
---
woah, this is an interesting snippet. Hard to know for sure when it came out, but PeterWind is very reputable. Send this up
---
bm is super for low gear levels, as you and other players get more geared lack of pet scaling hurts
---
i think it came even later, like wotlk or sth
---
Oh, I already know the pets I'll enjoy. I plan on having a broken tooth/zg bat for high end PvP and a wolf for PvE.
---
But for leveling I honestly don't care, I just want the most efficient one
---
I recommend listening to this vid about gear and loot

---
Also takes away a sense of danger if you can see an enemy rolling up on you from 200 yards away.
---
I agree with you that if rest of the raid plays well then having memespecs is no problem. Why are you repeating?
---
I did the math on if it was your spawns exactly and farmed on spawn.  Its enough to fully flask 16.9 raids of 40 people per week.
---
The answer is not everyone will be flasked.  Probably just the MT for most guilds and the hardcore guilds will pay the crazy gold to push their raids.
---
So this dude is talking about his stockades but not the fucking epic relic ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Nope me neigther.
---
&gt;There was a bit of eliteism when I was raiding Naxx on the pserver, but i never got that in retail.  I was actually barred from several raids, docked dkp and put on alt status for a month for accidentally bubbling at the wrong time...
---
Thats because its Naxx. You dont get to Naxx by making tons of silly mistakes, and raids expect people to know what they are doing at this point.
---
Nobody kicks people for bubbling at the wrong time though, so I suspect there's more to this story, like not bubbling off a certain mechanic and then blowing up the raid, or something like that.
---
2.0 is TBC pre-patch
---
Meme spec. You want MM/Surv spec for pvp
---
My main Classic goal is to try to collect the rare mounts, the ZG Tiger specially. Probably won't get any and I know for sure that the Scarab mount isn't possible at my current schedule
---
I remember when I saw the first ZG Tiger, shit was nuts
---
well, on passive it follows you too, but it doesnt attack your target or the mob that is chasing you if you pulled
---
Its the most american thing I can think of to believe you are better than everyone in other continents :D
---
All it takes is one dominant Guild with 40-50 people ranking to 13/14 at the same time to practically kill off the server, or at least cause a huge population decline. Yes, those guilds do exist on private servers and will on Classic as well.
---
Sure it is, for some parts of the game. Leveling is obviously BM domain. Furthermore, early PvP is actually great as BM on a fresh server. When no one has gear yet your pet is OP. This is a relatively brief period, though, and MM/SV quickly takes over the PvP crown when people start raiding. How long depends on the general progress of your server.
---
Then there are raiding. For Molten Core there are actually a deep BM spec that works. Furthermore, once you have your hit gear and don't need Surefooted from SV the optimal spec for raiding is a MM/BM (20 points in BM). This is because you actually got a lot of damage talents in BM, where as SV don't really grant much else than utility if you already got hit cap from gear.
---
&gt; The greatest part of classic and burning crusade was that server reputation was everything.
---
only if you got lupos before his nerf.
---
Not in Vanilla/Classic, because Beastial Wrath in Vanilla/Classic only enrages the pet, not the player. BW giving both Hunter and pet an enrage is a TBC thing.
---
..or a wild body pull, maybe from behind. BoP the healer. Hard pull with one too many mobs and little CC? No problem, put on a shield and off tank it for a bit. Healer falling behind or oom.. not a problem. The most underrated thing is the stun.
---
This is a fantastic point, didn't realize it until now.
---
But yeah, the zones just felt more... human, I suppose. They're not perfect, but it's because of that they became memorable. For example it was inconvenient that the Night Elves were isolated from the Alliance. But it was supported by lore, led to both Auberdine and Menethil Harbor becoming key places of travel, and created the famous Wetlands Death Run. The Barrens became loved due to the effects of it's huge size. Desolace really felt desolate since it was often abandoned. Moonglade was only easily available to druids, who turned it into their own little sanctuary where they mingled with the other faction. Alliance players had to do a crazy trek just to get to Scarlet Monastery and Shadowfang Keep. Hillsbrad Foothills turned into an unique player-made PvP zone. Stranglethorn vale became Stranglethorn Vietnam on PvP servers. Deadwind Pass felt mysterious and dangerous because there was nothing there and it was filled with high level mobs. 
---
I could go on and on, but many of the things we love about the old zones don't come purely from the design, but from the  inconvenient design leading players to create the "culture" of the zone. We love those zones for what players made them into, and they all felt distinct - not just because they look different, but because they were mechanically different. Stonetalon was hell to navigate. Stranglethorn Vale had the most lucrative quests. And so on.
---
This is some Game theory wisdom right here
---
Just noting, but nearly all these account of "elite hardcore try hard toxic players" appear to always be alliance.
---
Just saying...
---
Tilt one back with me laddie.
---
Fair point, and that was a big motivator back in the day, but now I think that won't be as much of a factor.  Especially considering the "peer pressure" if you will of community posts about how much better the Horde is at (nearly) everything due to racials.  Dorf Priests and Fear Ward being an exception.
---
"BUBBLE HEARTH"
---
PvP - Man, hunters are pretty great. Deadzone can be frustrating as can heavily armored enemies. The most range, Viper sting, aimed shot &gt; Multishot burst, and Aspect of the cheetah are all super fun. I like the role of hunter in AB and WSG. You get to play a zone control, viper sting, 1v1 role. Hunters do have a pretty high skill ceiling and I feel as though they benefit more than most classes from engineering. It really shores up their dead zone weakness. If you have solid gear clothies will fear you. Even just auto-multi-auto can be brutal. 
---
PvE - More of a utility class. You have tranq shot which is essential on some fights. You can also kite which is powerful. Your DPS starts out fairly strong and gets comparatively worse and worse. Hunters have one of the most involved rotations in classic especially as you try to push them more and more. Some guilds are not going to take a lot of hunters, so it may be hard to get a raid spot.
---
I do think hunters are a little underrated. I feel like a lot of people think of them doing bad damage in PvE and being average in PvP. I think a skilled hunter with engineering is a nightmare in pvp. I do not really care about my overall raid DPS as a hunter. I am going to aim for just doing good "hunter dps." 
---
I have to decide if I am going to main hunter in classic and it might be hard not to. You look cool, you get a cool pet, you can farm gold well, you are good in PvP, you will get gear in raids. You can roll on any weapon. You have leveling cheat codes. I guess it is decided...
---
This exact situation has already happened on private servers who've gone this route though. Population was around 5k to start and dipped *very* quickly to 2-3k because anyone level 48+ was farmed constantly. Imagine only having a few hours a day to play after work and being camped for half of that time, **every single day.** Casuals still enjoy World PvP, but it's not going to be like it was back in Vanilla. The game is too min-maxed now and all about efficiency. No one was doing this back in 2005 when the honor system was first released.
---
The thing is, by choosing to bring a Ret, you are consciously choosing to bring a subpar player who will contribute less than 50% of what the other DPS bring.
---
It's not a matter of "min maxing", it's matter of "not purposefully reducing your raid's effectiveness".
---
Don't forget to put ad before and after your video.
---
it and every patch before it was a TBC pre-patch. aka: before TBC.
---
well... pissing off a paladin in that case is kinda funny.
---
And it also gets worse when you take in consideration pets don't scale *at all*  with master's stats (there's just specific minimal gear/set bonuses that improve them, though, besides the BM talents). Tbc added it as well.
---
There won't be a problem at all. Maybe you end up with some tryhard in a dungeon at lvl 25 who yells at you for not being the best, but the top tier players you won't interact with or maybe even see.
---
Pservers have new players and players without a clue too. If you're not being difficult,  you'll be fine and get along with  99.99% of players.
---
Those will not be the only areas to worry about; every level 48+ zone will be camped by rankers on some servers. Searing Gorge, Un'goro, Felwood, Plaguelands, Burning Steppes, BRM, Dire Maul entrance, you name it.
---
Pretty sure the classic wow reddit sub already know how the classic wow honour system works.
---
While you’re, by and large, right, there are exceptions who don’t mind talking, and explaining the game. Even debating different opinions. I got back into vanilla wow through private servers just over a year ago after a 12 year hiatus. I’d always mained a Warrior.  One of the first geared out warriors I saw was 5/8 T2, Ironfoe, like crazy geared. I asked him why he was wearing Lionheart Helm with his Prot gear, and he kindly explained that in addition to increased threat, it’s also just a really high quality item. I added him as a friend, and while I was reacquainting myself with the 2018 meta, I’d whisper him to ask questions, and he’d always answer. Point being he was really nice about it and not the toxic pserver guy you’d expect.
---
This is not the World PvP you fondly remember from 2005-2006.
---
Thanks for reminding me of those zones!  I have not played them since Wrath came out and forgot how cool they were.  It would be awesome to include more zones like that within the Vanilla world.
---
It'll be just like a new realm being released in vanilla and people didn't die of some world PvP.
---
Oh if that's what you mean then yeah, definitely. Won't stop people from trying to not bring Hunters to MC "because they're bad" though lol
---
I remember getting to rank 10 in Vanilla as a semi-casual PvPer. Never intended to make it beyond that. 
---
It was much harder than I had anticipated - the last couple weeks were a huge grind so don't underestimate the amount of work it takes. I was putting in several hours daily in AB for several weeks. Rank 9 is the more manageable one.
---
&gt;They bring powerful blessings and auras, can keep the group alive through "oh shit" moments with offheals, bubbles, keeping shit off the healer in hairy sotuations, or other utility.
---
Holy paladins can do all of that and not be a useless meme DPS.
---
There’s a lot of assumptions made here. The most glaring is that there will be 1 side camping the other for 16+ hours a day. 1 faction may try but that’s what world defense and gathering you faction to fight off campers is for. I think this phase will be a unique amazing experience for some 1 of a kind world pvp. If these things however truly scare you the solution is simple. Roll on a pve server.
---
Starting WSG on the same date as someone who hit 60 a week into Classic launching doesn't change a whole lot. People can still queue into WSG while leveling as well, although it'll be much less than the level 60s. 
---
We'll still be out farming honor in the world inbetween queues, but at least this compromise will give other players a little bit of breathing room level 48+
---
Man you know what I mean why you gotta play a smart ass
---
Well yeah, otherwise your eyes will dry up.
---
&gt; its just cool to be a part of something so big and rare
---
Must. Not. Make. Nazi Germany. Reference.
---
There's no chance it's over 6 months long, Dire Maul launched only a couple of months back in Vanilla.
---
+ the brs boss is aids as hell
---
What he’s saying is that it was a patch that was made in preparation for TBC to make the transition easier on people, as computer hardware was very different then. It is quite likely without TBC that patch would have never existed.
---
Right, I stand by what I said.
---
There is no "power leveling" in vanilla.  There's no shortcuts.  The fastest way to level is to use a guide and follow it so that you don't have to think about where quests and their objectives are, and kill every mob you pass as you run from quest to quest.
---
I once convinced a friend(paladin) of mine to roll on dal rends main hand as a joke not thinking he would actually do it. Six months later he still got whispers telling him to go fuck himself. No, he wasn't wearing the sword.
---
&gt;Groups would just form up and get in discord, then go to a zone and just gang bang each other over and over to get ranks. 
---
Each kill gets you 10% less than previous for the same target. It gives you little honor to kill somebody over and over.
---
I hit the refresh button every 5 mins for 3-4 hours a day on Reddit/WoW Forums/Barrens Chat Forums/MMOchamp
---
I am aware of that. I just wanted to point out that A and D are not the only strafe keys that people like to use.
---
&gt; Just noting, but nearly all these account of "elite hardcore try hard toxic players" appear to always be alliance.
---
&gt; Just saying...
---
For good reason, in Classic Alliance seems to be the go to faction for server firsts, therefor all the try hards more often than not go Alliance
---
It all has to do with how many spots there are and how often you'll raid.
---
If there are 5 spots and you raid three days a week then 3 reserves makes sense since nobody will have 100% attendance, not even the class leader.
---
&gt;Blasted lands once raiding scene kicks of will always have double door campers.
---
Why? What is in blasted lands?
---
The immersion was so good in them games.
---
I'm on ndale and horde, population is currently 54% alliance. No AB/WSG earlier in any bracket except for three players in a short lived 20-29 AB.
---
In the human intro when you make a character, the narrator mentions alliance soldiers fighting a war on the other continent. I assumed this was was with the horde?
---
36 and chill af
---
Not sure if serious or.....
---
It's not 2005 anymore, the game is completely different. PvP wasn't played back then as it is now, and neither is ranking. It's all about efficiency and honor per hour. On top of that, if your realm had MC &amp; BWL out on release, then you also had WSG &amp; AV out. Of course it wasn't that bad since rankers were in either BG, or only ganking in the open world in between queues (maybe). Most rankers I knew on my vanilla server just sat in Ironforge inbetween queues 99% of the time.
---
&gt;Just go play pve servers??? if you're scared of groups ganking you then go play pve servers honestly.
---
Thats such a dumb fucking argument and shows you havent thought about the issue AT ALL.
---
Well, that will for sure happen, but honestly I don't see it as a problem. Knowing that hunters are good in early raids is not exactly a secret, so the problem will only really be for the very worst PuG groups lead by people that don't know anything about the game. Personally I'd not want to waste my time in such a group, so it's fine by me.
---
Yeah, let’s just be pointlessly pedantic
---
As a passionate Horde player i would like to tell you to forsake your class and be Horde no matter what, but you should play the way is more fun to you. Either choice you take, you will be experiencing the game in a new way.
---
I recommend you to watch the next videos on Youtube:
---
https://youtu.be/xACddNKUNtc - for picking a faction
---
https://youtu.be/U0OMrgWBNK4 - for picking a class
---
https://youtu.be/3t-OsvFBiXE - for picking a class too
---
See you soon in Azeroth, as an enemy or as an ally!
---
Part of the reason why people are assholes in retail is because you never interact with the same player twice unless you’re in a guild with them, which gives no incentive to bond or to care about other people. 
---
That isn’t to say that people won’t be jerks in Classic, but the incentive structure will be for people to at least try to cooperate a little bit.
---
First time on this sub? Have you seen some of the questions that get posted here every day?
---
Nope.
---
And yes, I check this sub twice a day so I have seen most of the questions that get posted here.
---
The absolute best thing you can do for yourself once Classic releases or even before is find a guild, read their recruitment posts check out the quality of their application process and get in a good well run guild. Even if you don’t end up raiding your experience will be 100% better if you are in a guild with players that have similar goals to you.
---
&gt; Why would you force rankers to sit in a bg queue 12 hours a day for 3 months, running flags against afk players who cannot organize and instead will just roll over until they get a pug v pug instead of doing actual fun 5v5s+ in the open world?
---
"Who cannot organize" Freaking hilarious way to say that premades are naturally better than random pugs; cannot organize my ass, premades will always tend to be a lot better due to comms and practice and it is not fun at all to go against premades. Premades also actively prefer to not play against each other in the pserver scene, because it loses them time. This whole issue is because of the shitty honor system, nothing more and nothing less
---
You forget the point, that if some one had the required points to be r14, he could still lose the spot by the people who had the points as well but just a bit more honor points
---
Yean imagine putting up with this when there are 10 guilds in your faction recruiting that clear BWL and MC in those few hours you have available to play. 
---
Back in the day you had to put up with it or not raid at all.
---
Well then, if you want broken tooth, be sure to tame it as soon as you can after hitting level 37. If you wait until level 60, it's gonna be a real PITA leveling BT then. Much easier to level BT while you are leveling yourself. And I'd recommend training growl, bite, claw, and dash for your cat while leveling. When you hit 60 and want to PvP, drop growl and put prowl in its place.
---
l
---
The issue isn't busy servers, it's servers with massive faction imbalances. In that case queues were up to 2 hours long, and Blizzard is going to be looking for ways to fix that.
---
In my scenario, as I stated before...  You want to run that dungeon, so *you* take the initiative and RUN to it.
---
Relying on others is lame.
---
I have the same girlfriend (wife now) as i had during classic.. she is really looking forward to classic launch (Thats a lie).  
---
Infact We are still the geeky bunch of friends now in our 30’s that stayed togheter since vanilla, and we already have a long weekend of wow-LAN planned, in a Brand new huge lakeside cabin with fiber 🥳
---
&gt; Can it be played? Sure, everything can be played. Did you mean it by that?
---
Yeah, that's why I mentioned a casual or semi hardcore guild. Those types of guilds aren't going for world first and aren't going to care about min/maxing too much. They just want to clear content which you'll be able to do by bringing a Ret Paladin or two to a raid. Especially up to AQ40 which they probably won't complete anyway since it requires such a big time investment.
---
The buying from the chinese did definity not happen when I was playing vanilla.
---
It was 5-10 guys premading constantly and switching  weekly who would get more honor to be the nr 1.
---
In talking about Dragonmaw, Raa, Qbtq, Louna, Lillian, Kelty, Helvicta, Salvator, Leithoricas and all other topping players back then on that server. There was no account sharing nor buying product
---
It was definitely intentional. They were following up Dark Age of Camelot which came out 3 years earlier and had a really impressive, more realistic art style.
---
That game was like the pinnacle of early 2000s graphic design. Check out the detail on the armor design: 
---
[Paladin set - gold and silver armor with intricate griffon and grail details](http://camelot.allakhazam.com/epic/paladin/paladin-original-cats.jpg)
---
To be fair that screenshot is from a bit after WoW released after the game got some graphical updates (like visible shoulder armor) - [But here's a pre-WoW screenshot of some Cleric chain armor](http://camelot.allakhazam.com/epic/cleric/original.jpg). Really impressive for its time.
---
WoW was going for a more whimsical fantasy setting that focused less on detail and more on the slightly absurd. Both games look great but went in separate directions.
---
And WoW was definitely aware of Dark Age of Camelot. People talk about EverQuest a lot, but I see a lot more apparent influence from DAoC. It introduced to the genre a faction-based PvP system, a character specialization system (similar to talents), a mostly seamless world, and a bunch of mechanical stuff that all found its way into WoW in some form.
---
&gt;you will be unable to level 58-60
---
you will be unable to level 48-50.
---
Here, fixed it for you.
---
No, it's not fabrication. It might be a slight exaggeration but what you are saying is very far from the truth. 
---
I played a DPS Warrior in Vanilla and had no issues whatsoever to get into PUGs for instances/raids due to my reputation on the server. The same way there were several players (and guilds) that were blacklisted from joining PUGs on my server due to their poor reputation. 
---
There were even addons to help blacklist players from joining PUGs.
---
Reputation really played a crucial part in Vanilla for anyone that had to rely on PUGs for raids and/or PvP. The only players that did not have to care for reputation was those that did not interact much with the rest of the community, because they only played alone/with their friends or with their guild and no one else.
---
I remember during vanilla I encountered several very helpful individuals. From ppl helping with quests, answering questions to coming to my aid when I was being ganked. I kept in touch with those people throughout vanilla and I feel like a little community bubble developed from those experiences. When I hit 60 I would group with the same people for BGs and dungeons. I think that being a little vulnerable and putting yourself out there is a great way to meet positive players.
---
Wow that is nuts when you think about it, considering how it's an expected part of everyone's consumables from TBC onwards. Thanks for the information!
---
Horde was outnumbered during vanilla 
---
It was only with the addition  of blood elves the population balanced 
---
And then half of the horde was made of blood elves
---
As a priest, there is always ONE who refuses to run back.  ALWAYS
---
I found the first song choice very fitting. “Every PVP video is exactly the same.”
---
My wife's brother actually achieved Scarab Lord in early WOTLK. He rolled a rogue on one of the fresh servers on release, rushed as fast as he could to be ahead of the pack, and grinded it out there.
---
Whoa, shamans don’t have totems anymore?
---
Yep, I was one of the Alliance who quit. Once I got to SG, it  became too much. I couldn't quest anywhere. I resolved to hide in random spots and grind but so many people were quitting that I couldn't get groups for dungeons or elite quests. I just stopped logging in one day.
---
Same. I'm on vacation and got a local SIM card so I can check this shit instead of enjoying the beach
---
I have a habit of making alts and leveling them to 60 quickly and happily, because I still love old zones. Once I get to Northrend or Outland, I always lose motivation for some reason and then I just have a level 60 alt sitting around. I guesss this is why!
---
Not everything will be easy in this game and phase 2 will not last forever. If you hate lvl 60 players farming you then go on a pve server. Telling them to add a bg early so rankers can just que bgs for longer is wack. I think a phase where pvp is incentivized and wpvp is the only way is awesome.
---
I'll admit it was during the fight where you're supposed to bubble the tank at a specific time because the boss webs everyone, and I bubbled early, which did result in a full wipe.  I would say however I wasn't the first person to do this, and it was simply used as a way to keep people from doing it again I found out.
---
Anyone notice?
---
No DBM, no aggro meter, no healing meter, no OOR meter, no one-click healing, nothing.
---
No CT raid frames, either.
---
This was 40-man raiding at it's best.  /s
---
This was when everyone in your guild learned macro's for announcements.  
---
This was why so many of us farmed for hours upon hours.
---
And many of us will do this again if only WoW created a new Azeroth.  This was fuckin' fun.
---
If you add WSG, don't you think wPvP would get a big hit?
---
I agree that many people won't be at 60 by the time P2 is supposed to hit, but wouldn't people have the incentive of ganking a lot anyway considering that the 60 pop that actively ranks at that level is low? I feel like this all depends on how long the phases last
---
1-12 should be in Teldrassil; depending on your class you may elect to grind around level 9 before tackling the cave quests, or group up. After that you go to Darkshore and those quests should easily get to you level 18 in conjunction with grinding as you go.  
---
An alternative is to pop out of Teldrassil a little early and grind there on level 10-11 mobs instead of Teldrassil before doing Darkshore.  
---
If your duo partner has class quests like pally then they should stay in their start area until they do their level 10 class quest to save travel, as these trainers aren't in Darnassus.
---
Personally, I’m with you. 1.12 AV is really more PVE than PVP.
---
However I think majority of people just want their rep and to never bother with it again as opposed to the day long back and forth battle royale.
---
Well i’m a Mage so i’ll have mis-matched armor at 60 too😪
---
And? What kind of shithole monitor or care about your Google searches? I mean no offence but that is borderline unacceptable.
---
And we shouldn't prevent that. There already is a way to prevent getting attacked if you wish so. Don't play on PvP server if you aren't ready to be camped &amp; killed. War is hell.
---
you wont be able to meet him, unless he is slower or waits you, traveling to westfall takes awhile.
---
i'd do initial darkshore quests up to level 13 or 14 then go to westfall, and catch up with you friend at some point there. 
---
I have a [teldrassil route](https://i.imgur.com/Z6viTxH.jpg) i made a year ago or so, i was planning to revisit it and optimize even more, but it showed itself decently fast. Not saying its the best or anything. i ahve some new idea since.  again depends what times are we looking for. you could use some ideas  from it at least i guess :D. (it was for internal use so its messy, circles are approximate gy spawn radius, since you use them for travelling, and in teldrassil its all iffy so you knwo where to die to spawn in the right spot).
---
Not at all. Just want to be a part of the beginning, it's so much fun.
---
Well only clicking above the hotbar (or past 6/7 depending on your dexterity)
---
Don't count on dynamic respawn being a thing in Classic. Dynamic respawn and heavy mob density belong to private servers and aren't likely to exist at launch.  
---
Solo power levelling is going to be a smart combo of quests and grinding. The best xp/hr is going to depend on what your class is?
---
That would be good advice if the Old Elitism was not being revived along with Vanilla WoW.
---
I am already hearing "Those classes sucked in Classic" from certain people in my guild on retail and we are not even remotely close to being a hardcore guild.
---
The mentality of "Min-Max the shit or don't bother coming" is returning.
---
If your team is ranking, you will likely dodge other premades.
---
I was not talking about history but what happens now and what will happen in classic.
---
I never felt like Nagrand was inhospitable.
---
Mate, most of the raids in Vanilla didn't require all 40 members of the team to be pulling their 100% maximum effort all of the time.  We all know of folks who went afk or died early.
---
Gearscore was the final nail in the coffin with WoW for me.
---
This also helps teach pulling mobs of two or more.
---
The hunter keeps pet on passive, hits one, three come, trap is to one, FD, then let pet begin attack on the trapped one while the other 2 run back.
---
Pulling is one thing that hunters should excel at with the trap / FD skills.
---
New expansion hype takes care of that :D
---
There were some guys that did a swimming race around kalimdor on my server.
---
Took em a couple hours.
---
Does Survival's 'Sure Footed' talent stack with Orc's stun resist racial? Or is a stun not considered a movement impairing effect?
---
I have not played vanilla so I can't really say 😅😅 I just plan on making mage on classic.
---
Not in classic.
---
It's not just the art style for me. It's the way things are arranged in the post-cata world. Every quest is picked up at most a 3 minute walk from where it is resolved.  
---
Why would, for instance, an alchemist from undercity take the time to travel to Stonetalon mountains to get some slime from wyverns there - WITHOUT actually doing it himself or bringing muscle to do so?  
---
Why does he stand 50 meters away from said wyverns waiting for someone to help him?  
---
In vanilla you could get quests for Burning steppes in Undercity, or quests for Scarlet Monastery in Hillsbrad. There was something believable about that. If I were an NPC living in Orgrimmar, and needed something from Jintha'Alor in Hinterlands, I wouldn't travel to stand outside Jintha hoping someone would come by. The trip would be wasted if no one came.  
---
I'd just stay at home in Orgrimmar and ask people to travel there.
---
2.0 is TBC, not Vanilla.
---
When 2.0 hit it contained all of the BC Talents and new abilities. Even Blood Elf and Draenei. It was all just 'unlocked' in the actual TBC release date.
---
Part of it depends on how long the phase is yes, but the vanilla honor system was only a thing for 50 days before WSG and AV were introduced. It seems silly to devote an entire phase to that.
---
I know it is a private server but I found one in STV the other day. Not sure if that was private server specific or just a reality that it can happen.
---
I believe there was a script you could run via macro that allowed you to open up the view distance anyway. I remember using it to where I could barely see my character during raids and be able to avoid so many more things.
---
Best spec for fast leveling? MM/SV, MM/BM or BM/SV?
---
Disengage reduces threat on the current target. Example. You pull aggro off your pet because your Marksman leveling, and you don't have FD yet. OR You've already used FD and this is your last desperate attempt to reduce threat so your meat shield can take over.
---
Dude, you're wrong.
---
I’m pretty sure “movement impairing effect” would roots and slows only.
---
this PvP server is going to die when lvl 48 players are camped by 60s with no hope or chance for any retaliation. casuals will quit and the server population will die. that is a fun experience for the people who are ganking and no one else.
---
I get the PvP on a PvP server but the industrial ganking that will occur is not going to be healthy for the server population. who are the top end players going to sell to and buy from on the AH when everyone is gone because they drove them off the server?
---
Like it or not top end PvP no life gank squad players need casuals for a functioning economy and they will only doom themselves in the long run when those casuals are tired of spending their play time as a ghost.
---
The way it has evolved on private servers, you don't *really* have to play every waking hour. The community decides on a weekly honor cap that's low enough to be reachable in less time. It still takes a lot, but we're talking more like 8-10 hours a day, or you can take a couple of days per week off if you play more hours than that. 
---
Back in the day, most servers had little to no organization around the honor system. There'd be some premades and rotations and such, but often people would just strive to get as much honor per week as at all possible and then the players within any given premade would take turns hitting R14 in whatever order they decide.
---
With that approach, getting into the top bracket might take, say, 1.5mil honor per week--basically as much as whomever grinds the most, which means somebody out there will put 18h/day into it. With the way it's done these days, the server's PvP community will decide on a more reasonable amount, like 500k or 750k or something. Noone goes over that limit. If they do, they get shut out of the premades and has no chance of progressing further, so people usually play along.
---
If that trend continues in Classic, it's possible to go for R14 even if you have a day job, as long as you can spend all your spare time grinding BGs for a few months. That's a hell of a lot easier, but it also means that many more players will be hitting R13 which takes way less time and is good enough for pretty much all non-melee classes. Since the upgraded PvP gear will apparently be available from the start, I think people will be surprised by how many choose to grind for the high ranks.
---
This is why it is hard, playing the classes that we plan to play! On the horde side, our route is pretty well developed up until level 20 because both of us, regardless of what we opt to play, will be leveling in the barrens. There doesn't seem to be any standard link up point for the Alliance.
---
One of our plans was for the other to run to Darkshore, meet up there and then continue on that way. While one of us run to the others location, the one who isn't going to be running can be picking up the quests ready to share and then running another character to the bank so we have a combined Bank Alt for the time being.
---
It. Will work just fine.
---
You just can’t /sit proc it.
---
Ofcourse it is. There is an objective best way to farm honor, and this will spread and get applied by anyone looking to rank rather quickly.
---
Thank you for your input!
---
Sweet, this helps confirm that I still want to play a hunter in Classic!
---
I think you are right.
---
Why wouldn’t you just bind s and d to spells and save a and e for strafe
---
That's really odd then, it seems like a relatively balanced server. The twitchers were talking about how no one runs bgs/ranks anymore because it's kind of pointless (since classic is coming out), and all that there is to do is to practice leveling routes. So maybe that has something to do with it? I have no idea. Most people that want to pvp/duel/wsg on pservers just play on the in house server now, fwiw. DM if you want more information.
---
Did they already say that ?
---
By whom was it deemed too strong?   
---
Nost absolutely took the cake when it came to PvP participation. Everybody and their mom ranked atleast to 7, many to 10, a select few in the grand scheme of things to 12-14. 
---
LHC and ND PvP was dead on arrival in comparison to the absolutely flourishing PvP scene on Nost.
---
I personally would also say that slightly after BWL is released the gear should be updated, so people can farm couple pieces of BWL gear and then the BWL tier R12-13 gear gets released.
---
Releasing the updated 12-13 gear after AQ will butcher PvP like it did on LHC and ND.
---
There will be a few nerds like chinese honorsellers and nolifers like Monkeynews and his gang, but the average casual will not bother ranking to R7-10 if they can get equal gear from Dire Maul, UBRS and such dungeons.
---
Alright, i do want to play mostly PVP and i feel that MM is the more "stand and shoot" spec where i want to get my hands dirty a bit more and have some utility over dmg.
---
I doubt it. Alliance still easily has the numbers advantage on private servers.
---
I don't think it's that silly. I'd rather have a big event for AV/WSG like back then, although I understand the concerns.
---
Also, loved ur guides dude keep rocking
---
According to an old sticky post from the official forums (so not an actual bluepost, but stickied by Blizzard):
---
&gt; Does reckoning work on both spell and melee crits? 
---
&gt; Yes. 
---

I've been playing for the last couple weeks and I have had a great experience running into higher-level players that have helped me out and giving me tons of advice I've had no problem grouping with people either
---
Absolutely, initially I was convinced I'd be rolling an undead priest for PVP but meh I'd rather have fun with my character so this week decided to say sod it and go with the race I'd pick if racials were removed from the equation.  One Rastafarian Troll priest coming right up, might be tricky not drinking milk or eating pork/clams while levelling at first but should be more fun than playing a rotten corpse.
---
I likely will have that amount of time, and I'm still not even going to bother.
---
I mean, it's not like it's impossible. If you have a Guild of 60, it's doable. Everyone helping you on your way up.
---
Not true anymore, now the consensus is that it’s only better when you’ve practically got fullNaxx BiS and every possible buff in the game, and it loses its value if you lose the buffs. 
---
On top of that, it doesn’t have Improved Aspect of the Hawk, which is anazing for bosses.
---
&gt; 2.0 is TBC, not Vanilla.
---
2.0 came out in 2006. TBC was 2007.
---
I mean I played Warrior Paladin and Hunter in Vanilla and the rest of the classes except Shaman at least a bit at 60 on pservers and Ive never felt threatened at all when facing Druids. The worst is just the incredible annoyance of being Moonfire kited, but thats really just solved by walking away from the fight.
---
Thank you, it's quite good at the very least to be able to see the GY loactions!
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it. I get the arguments on both sides, but I feel no BGs at all will have a very negative effect on some servers overall health &amp; population.
---
OP has not tried to rank because he admitted he was 7 years old when Vanilla came out. Why he’s so up in arms about this I do not know.
---
Exactly!
---
The huntard lives on! Don't stress it. Any hunter who says they haven't fucked over their group in some way with their pet on accident is a liar. Just learn from it.
---
Cool ill play on a pve server where i dont have random rng of not being able to do parts of the game i like.
---
I remember in Vanilla, probably 1.7, people were saying if your agility was over 350 then you could switch over to Survival. There were talent changes after that point that put it to bed though.
---
Here we go again. Now many of these posts are we going to see?
---
Is your guild named after the slayer song? That’s so fucking metal.
---
Hopefully
---
The hardcore pserver shit heads will be a minority as soon as classic drops.
---
You, me, and about 40 other people total!
---
Why was the leader of the pug putting up with it?
---
Yeah, that's why I said the people camping those zones would be camping them anyways. If they're camping people lower than 55 they are just wasting their time since it means they are either: 
---
a) not leveling to 60 and are gonna get beat out in honour by ppl at 60
---
b) they are getting no honour killing those lowbies so they aren't gonna be doing anything meaningful.
---
People who would be camping there would be doing it regardless of the reward. In my opinion, anyways. Anyone trying to be efficient is going to rush to 60 and then spam kill people in EPL / BRM / DM entrance.
---
2.0 released December 5th 2006 and Burning Crusade released January 16th 2007. 2.0 was the Burning Crusade content patch, regardless of when it came out.
---
Anyone the patch version changes the first number, that means it's for a different expansion. 1.x is Vanilla, 2.x is Burning Crusade, 3.x is Wrath, 4.x is Cataclysm and so on. The release date is irrelevant.
---
What about their dmg though? Was that also just pointless even in BM spec?
---
Look at how slow he dies to how fast he dies on private servers
---
Ah kk, how can I see if if I am not using "old reddit"? There is no threads sticked to the sidebar in new reddit that I can see
---
I enjoyed GW2 but it's nothing like the original.  I still play Guild Wars 1 to this day.  I find it unique because you can come up with builds for certain areas.  You can even come up with cheesy life steal builds for certain bosses.
---
The content seems endless, there is so much to work towards and many times I need to plan it out since it can be a time investment.  The art, music, and gameplay remind so much of the first few years I played GW and WoW.  
---
One of my favorite things to do in GW is to live off the land.  Simply taking a journey and killing stuff.  Then afterwards, you ID and salvage the stuff you don't need and make it into steel, wood, cloth, leather, etc.  From there, you can build your wealth or make a big purchase or farm more!
---
I've timed a lvl 1 druid to 26 min from Teldrassil to Kharanos, Dun Morogh - by drowning. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9jqhe5/how\_to\_avoid\_the\_wetland\_death\_run\_as\_a\_night\_elf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9jqhe5/how_to_avoid_the_wetland_death_run_as_a_night_elf/) .
---
I did not end up in the starting area but in Kharanos, might be a pserver specific artifact.
---
No, because hunters are best.
---
That is the dark irons, the gurubashi, the scarlet crusade, the twilight hammer, the silithid etc.
---
"y'all got that classic WoW news?"
---
\*scratches neck while twitching"
---
Guild banks need to be released in Phase II or something.  Its just got to happen.
---
Vanilla WoW was the casual experience when the game first came out but I can see it being considered hardcore for newer players. And this system worked when Vanilla first came out and on private servers after it so I think it's a little too damning to assume that the PvP server will "die" when people start getting ganked. The game is 15 years old with stories about what life was like on those servers are well known, so anyone joining the server will be doing so knowing full well the risks, that includes most "causals". And if people descide it isn't for them then there are PvE servers they can join and get the experience they want.
---
I think regular player can forget about black lotus unless its mechanics are changed. It spawns in a few predictable locations that can be easily 24/7 camped by RMTers or mafias. Every pserver has had to change somehow how it works.
---
Another great feature was how there were sooo mamy quests in Stormwind or Orgrimmar that took you to other zones. Or a quest in Barrens that took you to EK. Now all quests in zones are just like you describes: conveniently right beside you. A day in the old world was an adventure. A day in BFA or Legion is just a series of tasks you plow through to tick some boxes so that tomorrow you can tick those boxes slightly faster. 
---
At the end of the day, Vanilla was built to be a sandbox world, retail is built to hit arbitrary numbers and boxes.
---
Is simple 
---
You kill a lot 
---
Like a lot 
---
For a long time 
---
Then you rank up
---
Rinse and repeat
---
I absolutely agree and this is also part of why I don't want improved graphics nor models. This is a universe that we should all enjoy the same, having an option to play with old graphics on retail is pointless as it is for having new graphics on classic.
---
You'll likely find decent success with a 0/21/30 spec (taking scatter shot over wyvern sting, as it's generally as good or better in *most* PvP situations). With it you'll get 1% extra hit, 5% extra chance to resist movement impairment, 3% extra crit, and Counter Attack.
---
Otherwise a very common PvP spec is 0/31/20, to get Trueshot Aura.
---
*Generally* 0/31/20 gives you better damage (Trueshot Aura, 15% multi-shot damage boost, 5% extra ranged damage boost) over 0/21/30 (15% extra agi, 3% extra crit), but the deeper Survival talents are, as mentioned, handy toolkit-type skills, particularly Counter-Attack for escaping melee situations.
---
I don't think this subreddit is that representative of what the population will actually look like. Sure, there will be hardcore veterans, but I'd wager that there'll be way more "young bloods" who have never played Classic and want to see what the hype is about. Or just returnees from the actual Vanilla WoW who haven't really played on private realm.
---
That's fair, hope you enjoy your time!
---
In vanilla, players had reputations. There was no way to change your ign, no way to hide. If ppl are unfriendly dicks, then that reputation will proceed them in a classic environment. This assumes of course an increase to server population does not make everyone a dime a dozen, like current mmo's.
---
Yeah I hate the design they took starting really with BC, but it really started to get worse after  Wrath. Everything felt artificial and on rails. It makes leveling a very linear experience.
---
I'm not saying it wasn't part of vanilla. He was saying xrbgs shouldn't be in classic because they weren't in most of vanilla. My point is naxx also wasn't in most of vanilla, so does that mean we also shouldn't have naxx? Of course not
---
The majority is willing to help players who are willing to learn. But there are certainly people that hate newcomers, like the story that StaySafe told about his guildmate and what he did with a molten core raid cd.
---
&gt; Anyone the patch version changes the first number, that means it's for a different expansion.
---
I never said otherwise. All I said was 2.0 came out in vanilla.
---
The only Issue with doing this is that you are not even going for Exploration exp. So although I'd now be in the starting area with my Friend, We would be struggling to catch up with those who have managed to level some, while I was running. 
---
This is why its more important that we blitz 1 - 12/13 before meeting up.
---
The one spawn per zone thing is a myth. I frequently found multiple black lotus per herb circuit in winterspring. The one hour respawn thing is bunk too, it was not on a fixed timer but some sort of dynamic respawn so it couldn't be locked down like on private servers. They were still rare but the overall node behavior was very different than people are used to on pservers.
---
Retail died with resilience.
---
The idea is from actual vanilla. That's not to say it was correct, but that's what was said at the time.  
---
You can get trueshot aura from other hunters. 
---
In deep survival you also have Killer Instinct for +3% crit, along with the extra crit from the 15% agi.
---
I’m just a little nervous about shaman healing in classic. I never actually healed back then so I hope I won’t come off too inexperienced lol.
---
Sorry but all arguments are cheap excuses for beeing an asshole. Don't get me wrong. I love Wpvp and will role on a pvp-server but ganking is a no go for me. I see absolutely no point in ganking greys. Yeah I've read arguments like ganking lowies will lure high level player and lead to huge battles. Never seen that beside some swipes in STV and battles for Hillsbrad before battlegrounds.
---
I wont argue about killing and ganking people on your level. I don't like ganking. Normaly I will kill somebody and move on. But I won't judge you for ganking people who actually bring honor. Do as you wish but leave greys alone. Don't kill the fun of other people just because your life is miserable.
---
Yep, this guy has the right idea
---
its just that Americans find way more things "toxic" and are in general very SJW. EU is more laid back and won't get upset and cry about toxicity for a single "fuck you" or similar.
---
as long as its not only 3 feet view distance like on 10k nost pop I am happy with the normal  view distance
---
If I was a NE I'd probably get a starving mountain lion in Hillsbrad at lvl 24 (1.2 attack speed), prowl is too good with shadowmeld.
---
People want #nochanges, but queuing for BGs totally sucked.  I hope the fix it.  
---
But I do like the idea of playing against the opposing faction.  It great to get to know your enemies (and inspire fear in those that know you!)
---
**So what about prioritizing BGs with players from your server first, then filling it up with other realm players?????**
---
The level 48 players will call for help.  Their factions level 60's will come to help. It was so in Vanilla. It was so in TBC. Hell, this is how it worked even in Wrath. You will have people on your faction just waiting for this call of help so they can get some world pvp with equal level players. Not every max level player will be only ganking lowbies.
---
My guild, which plans on having 2 full raid teams at least, has a number of players planning on patrolling various zones to shut down gankers so lower level players can quest without problems. This is the type of  community that will emerge in classic on most servers. So it was and so it shall be again.
---
Rogue and Warrior will be the 2 highest single target dps for a majority of the raids. IIRC, Warriors probably offer slightly more damage but Rogues are the ones with the aggro dump. Rogues also aren't asked to tank when they aren't raiding, if that matters to you.
---
Does anyone know where I can view classic animations? I can't see any on YouTube.
---
Also - Orc or Troll, Male or Female
---
Him playing arcane def makes this more vanilla
---
With me it's still default.
---
Don't need q and e when you have a decent mmo mouse
---
that can house all your spells/macros.
---
With alt and shift combos you get around 50 possibilities to store spells/macros under.
---
Played an alliance rogue during vanilla all the way through Naxx. Most of our top dps were other rogues, although the rolling ignites had the mages catching up to us towards the end. Only other dps within sight was a fury warrior.
---
Also pro tip: do sealfate/prep for vaelestraz. Infinite energy makes for aggro issues, even with vanish and salvation. We did too much damage and had to vanish twice on the fight.
---
I really doubt all of these threads will make Blizzard change their minds on the 1.11 versions of these PvP items. They've said they have no interest in progressive itemization.
---
At best, I would guess they would just move back the PvP reward system a phase or add a phase 2.5. 
---
I'm also not saying it would be difficult to progressively itemize the PvP sets, given that it is only a handful of items. I'm just not expecting miracles here.
---
&gt;it seems like the current player base is almost completely unforgiving of any mistakes, and expects absolute perfection from anyone playing at all times.
---
Yup. Nostalrius was the first time I played classic WoW, and private servers are for the most part a complete toxic shit fest.
---
I'm not expecting a huge improvement from what I've read over time on this subreddit and other WoW classic forums. The voices are very similar to the private server community. But at least they'll be diluted a bit by the more ultra casuals who aren't really active on forums and such.
---
nop:(
---
Wat. I'd like to know too.
---
Ganking will become a thing in Phase II.  You have time.
---
I don't understand what you mean. Nobody wants to run anywhere. If a summon is available it saves everybody time.
---
&gt;And this system worked when Vanilla first came ou
---
No, this exact system wasn't implemented in vanilla. The rewards are different.
---
&gt;private servers after it
---
Every post about players on those pservers say it was a major shitshow and a bad idea.
---
We were in ZG, and he was going apseshit in /say while our RL was in SW finding people. So he wasn’t aware of the dude losing his mind until half his raid dropped due to toxicity.
---
yeah but as someone else already said, it would make more sense to drop it slightly over a month after 8.2, so ppl who subbed for the 8.2 changes will sub for classic on month more and on top, ppl who want to play both wont get force to choose to "hard play" one.
---
This is not a sad thing this is a wonderful thing means sooner release baby!
---
It may seem pedantic to you, but to some this is a significant issue.  
---
How characters behaved in the world did mean quite a lot for many people. Just like damage numbers not being the true vanilla dmg numbers either.  
---
I can get behind that we have more pressing concerns such as sharding/loot trading etc. which are being addressed, but once you start adding up all these "pedantic" changes you're gonna get a river of retail.
---
Elitism is usually understood as not only the believe to belong to an upper caste of society but also the believe that that caste is inherently more valuable and important. In the common sense you can't be an elitist without being what we'd call "toxic".
---
Elitist does not mean that you simply think you belong to the most effective group of players. Or to use an example: a hedge fund manager with an Ivory League degree might be an elitist, while most Nobel Price Laureates are aware of their talent but are usually anti-elitist.
---
You make a great point about "need diversity in tilesets, need 1 quest hub to oh so magically lead to another" and I think that's what Classic's appeal comes from - it seems like you're really helping people in the world, not helping yourself level.
---
And private servers never had honor system without BG's either.
---
There is no river of retail, just pedantic stupidity reading for upvotes.

excellent thanks for that!  so it is indeed very useful against bursty casters as well as physical.  love it!

i was assuming the internal cd would be 1.5 or something along those lines so that if you were being hit by a few pets and players in pvp u weren't just doing 5 hits per swing timer - so yeah this makes sense too
---
Shattered Hand Gnome Mage checking in
---
You can do it. I believe in youuuuu. Also fwiw (idk about shamans), if you stack correctly and math out your % into rank 11 for the week you will hit rank 12, then it could only take 1 more additional week to hit 13. (I think, a hunter did this in my premade). So like Week 7 he was 95% through rank 11, so he got br2 slot and at week 8 he was like 27% (not sure, just a number) through rank 12. Then he got a br1 slot and hit rank 13 week 9. Meaning he was only rank 12 for 1 week past being rank 11.
---
I don't remember the exact %s needed.
---
I'll be finding or making a casual guild only. For people that are newer and don't have the time to no life the game as well as don't want to act like an elite ass hole.
---
This is my question \^\^\^\^. Most raid leaders I know would have booted his ass no matter if he was a guildy or not.
---
Where did he mention dynamic respawns?
---
This may surprise many but I agree that killing low level players isn't personally enjoyable either. I don't follow the mantra of "it's red it's dead" because I don't want to cause other people to lose interest, and I personally prefer 1v1 duels that occur naturally. But I also can't deny the inevitability of it and positive aspects that come about as a result. 
---
Could you perhaps explain how what I've said sounds like excuses? I'd love to hear your reasoning.
---
On pservers there are 2 kinds of people:
---
-I know exactly what I'm doing, I'm hardcore, and want to be in a raid with others of said mentality.
---
-I came into WoW later on and never got to experience actual Classic, I'm here to explore.
---
Both have fun. But they don't really mix together. I don't think it is toxic, or more so of trying to take a vegan friend to a meat only option BBQ - you are not doing what both audiences want and that won't work.
---
Well I wouldn’t want to wait 2 hours your right, if blizz could fix it in another way I’d happy. I for one thing there should be faction locking on a case by case basis so that no server becomes to unbalanced.
---
I think this is one of those cross that brodge when we come to it situations.
---
How many servers are going to have 40-50 jobless wasters all alligned on one faction?
---
It's certainly enough of a worry that I would check what the "cool" servers were and avoid them, but not necessarily enough that I think Blizzard needs to intervene.
---
As someone who ranked on a private server recently and was partially responsible for a major drop in the alliance population, I agree with you OP.
---
Diremaul launch was especially brutal. Picture this: nearly every horde ranker camping the entrance of diremaul, mercilessly camping everyone who wanted to get their prebis or farm some dme lashers. We'd start at the entrance, wipe a group, and then fall back down the corridor to do it again. Repeat until the courtyard of dm where the horde pvers were congregating who would usually kill them again. From alliance who played during that time, they said it took them well over an hour to get from dm entrance to the dungeon entrance. We even used MC caps on people we didn't like on the server just so they couldn't even get into the instance.
---
This was just at DM launch. Like OP said, all of the lvl 48+ zones were camped by horde rankers who couldn't get bgs to pop. It was awful for alliance players and led to a major drop in their population. We'd get killed every now and again by a group, but it wouldn't last.
---
There's some points that OP is missing too. 
---
Respec costs in classic are going to be higher than private servers as most pservers reduce respec costs. If blizz keeps original values, not many people are going to be respeccing willy nilly. Those ITT saying "well just have your group come kill them." Your pve group consists of a holy priest, a prot warrior, pve rogue, etc. Pvp spec makes a big difference for a lot of classes. In addition to the points OP listed, consumables and engineering, it's so hard to beat a pvp group that is dead set on camping you. Let's not forget that without BGs pvpers are more likely to pop consumes in the open world. I know many were hesitant to use engineering gadgets like a rocket helm in the open world because it would put it on cooldown for a bg. Not going to happen without bgs. They're going to be used all the time for kills.
---
Lastly, there's already an entire phase of open world pvp in phase 1. There's going to be a lot of raids formed during that time period for the sole purpose of getting your world pvp fix, especially with the lack of DKs in phase 1. Adding bgs in phase 2 will break the monotony of phase 1 world pvp.
---
&gt;I hope they don't release it at the same time since I plan to play both (not rushing to 60) but I want to be there for classic launch still..
---
that's one reason why it's beliefed that they don't. Give ppl the chance to clear/play 8.2 and when they did so, bring classic to keep them going (paying)
---
wtf? none of those It's BM/MM you start with BM and then when you got beastial wrath you go for MM
---
Because its too easy ;-)
---
In my experience from p-servers alone are positive, people went out their way to help me and I returned the favor. I feel like people arent as hectic when it comes to vanilla, simply because helping out is necessary and getting help is necessary.
---
This made no sense. It's a pvp game mode, you literally sign up for it if you join the server.... if I wanna kill you just because then I am entitled to do this, you are gonna die.  
---
"Life is miserable" sounds like you are projecting.
---
If he knew what he was talking about he wouldn’t be asking questions.
---
Don’t be a gatekeeping asshole.
---
#1 is practice, but that’s not helpful advice.  You need to practice correctly.  Here are some tips:
---
1). Bind every useful ability to a button and train muscle memory.  Spells like mind soothe can clicked since they are out of combat, but if clicking makes you mess up your timing then it must be bound.
---
2) Theorycraft the usage of spells for yourself.  You can’t always be in the context where they are useful so think about when you might use them and try to set up situations where you can practice them.
---
3) Dabble in other classes enough to know what they can do, but know your class like no other.  Having too many alts not only untrains your muscle memory, but it takes away from mastering the thing you are playing the most.  Altitis doesn’t make you a better player.
---
4) Try to make friends you can count on and learn how they play.  You can’t save every situation and you’re not a one man army.  You need others in order to succeed.  Find people you can depend on and lean on their skills.
---
5) Take time after a wipe and think about the skills you didn’t use and how they might have helped.  Do this EVERY TIME.  Put away your blamethrower, and focus only on what YOU can do better.  Even when you succeed, think about what you can do to be more efficient.
---
has nothing to do with eachother. sure footed is for roots and slows.
---
What would you say were major changes for the class going into BC?
---
It was patched 1.10/11
---
Thank God I’m Horde and won’t have to deal with Retardins.
---
BM/MM. Your pet is really strong and can do most of the work for you and you use marginally fewer arrows. It also allows you to rely a lot less on your gear and makes you a monster in PvP. 
---
SV is just really terrible for leveling, MM is ok, but the problem is Aimed Shotting stuff will almost always pull threat from the target, so you have to kind of use at as a finisher, or close to it. That being said, I leveled MM back in retail, since the attitude back then was that only noobs spec into BM and that it was the no-skill spec.
---
No, I want to see the carnage, let those who are scared of dying on a computer game play pve servers.
---
&gt;The Vanilla Honor System was only in the game for roughly 50 days before WSG and AV were added.
---
I think the most important point that people are missing is that when the honor system first came out, nobody knew how it really worked. You had nobody gaming the system for maximum honor gains so players mostly just stuck to what they knew. Which was tarren mill vs southshore or PvP in Blackrock Mountain.
---
Trying to recreate this experience now that the honor system is fully understood and players are aware of how powerful the gear is (Not to mention we are getting 1.12 itemized rank 13/14 gear which never existed in the first place at this patch) is complete insanity.
---
&gt;There's no way you can l2p more than people who have been playing private servers for the past decade
---
Holy s***
---
Can we please stop pretending that classic wow will be ANYTHING like private servers? 
---
The hardcore no-life private server players are a minority. The only reason things are so insane on private servers is because almost everyone plays on the same massive server.
---
Once classic is released these people will be spread out on different regions and servers with a much smaller population. Classic WoW pvp meta will be NOTHING like the private pvp server meta and if you don't understand this you never pvped back in vanilla.
---
I wasn't very hyped for it until a few weeks ago. I was looking up something about Microsoft Azure. Then I remembered the Azuresong Mageblade, long story short, here I am, in the same boat as you :)
---
Cmon man! It's an INSTANT cast mount! You want this. You can do this!
---
Ahah thanks! I will check the videos out!
---
The moment 2.0 released, we were no longer in 'Vanilla'.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
---
Could you clarify what you mean? How is the system we are getting different than from when vanilla's life ended?
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/av4gdz/the_feeling_is_exhilarating/
---
&gt; The moment 2.0 released, we were no longer in 'Vanilla'.
---
False. TBC didn't come out for another month.
---
&gt; Speaking in case of Loot Council with a focus on decisions whats best for the raid. 
---
So then you must understand that it doesn't matter which core raider gets the item since the raid is going to benefit just the same.
---
read the tooltip...
---
I don't doubt people will still gank just for the fun of it before phase two but yes we will likely see less of it before then.
---
Welp I am that guy that kills any horde regardless of level. Remember redridge? Well I do.... Stv? I remember... If it's red it's dead... If your crossing my path your destination is the grave yard. Horde never fight fair, they all play typical classes and races, and honestly half of them don't even fight back
---
They are good I know that!  It’s just when you’re going for the timed run they don’t really hold their weight when it comes to getting the bosses down.  I mean after some gear comes in I wouldn’t stick my nose in the air by any means, but if I had to choose between them or a mage who is going to aoe down pulls like a monster plus provide a lot of dps on the bosses...: I’m going with the mage.
---
The release date of the expansion is irrelevant. The data for the expansion itself is what matters, which is fully contained within 2.0.
---
All initial changes made to the game for BC went live with the 2.0 patch.
---
At this point you're either trolling or you're so confused that it isn't worth explaining this anymore.
---
I'd put my view distance equal to the mob/player rendering distance. Its fucking stupid to be able to see all the way across the zone and watch players and mobs just pop in out of nowhere.
---
Get Gud
---
You don’t fight with 40 people. You fight with every other physical derps, rouge, worriers, huntarrrs, furrals.
---
Each boss drops around 2-3 items... and distribution depends on the guild.
---
Or just use and owl and focus them down quickly while the bird tanks all 3.
---
Why u gotta be mad?
---
Yes there are.
---
For Horde : alliance gnomes
---
For Alliance : alliance gnomes (dueling)
---
If you mean jank routes like blocked by terrain, the only thing to really watch for are obstacles in their path. If theyre just doing that randomly, its probably a pserver bug.
---
If you mean when your pet is running from target to target in combat, pet should always be on Passive except when searching for Rogues in PvP. CTRL+1 attack which target you want hit.
---
I stopped playing towards the end of MoP. I could not remember the name of it. Sitting here right now I can't remember the name of the other one after MoP either, nor which order they came out in. I just stopped caring. I used to play EQ as well and I couldn't tell you the name of the last 10 expansions...
---
And emergency heals if the healer gets silenced.
---
Everyone plays for their own reasons and everyone on a PvP server should expect to get ganked at some point. Have fun!
---
Did you know 2 level 48s can actually kill a level 60 if played correctly? It's actually easier then it looks. You need to be the aggressor and it takes 60s off guard.
---
It's not about being secret, but about access to information. Sure more or less everything about classic wow is known, but just like a high school math during an exam not by everyone when it matters. You need to have access to that information during the test to get a high score - or in this case score a lot of gold. 
---
Another thing to consider is the stock value of goods. Imagine the price of firebloom or dreamfoil, if every single character on a server rolls herbalism! Being able to analyze what will be popular and then going in a different direction can give you a huge edge. I don't blame Devvlul for not wanting to share his strategy.
---
This has just been discussed in another thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bcbo02/does_reckoning_proc_off_spell_crits/
---
Stacks never drop off unless you switch out the weapon, or I think if you take a zeppelin, receive a summon, or some other 'disconnection' from the primary world. 
---
No internal CD
---
You cannot /sit to manually generate stacks based on the playable demo from Blizzcon, so this likely won't be available in Classic like it is on all the current pservers.  But you will still generate a TON of stacks vs high crit% classes like rogues, 2h warr, mages.
---
Reckoning is kind of gimmicky but a HUGE boost in PVP especially if your gear isn't top notch and you're trying to compete.  You can play with it intelligently and tactically to generate stacks slowly or it can be a very straightforward defense against rogues and warr especially to just send a bunch of extra attacks their way.
---
I never PuG, to avoid both sides of this problem, I never meet "toxic" or "bad" players.
---
there are always gonna be toxic players but i think there are a lot of good/kind people in the classic WoW community.  for a lot of players WoW was their first or one of their first serious mmos and it was a learning experience when we started playing WoW. because of that we worked together to learn the ropes and help each other all the time. for classic, there are a lot of those same people coming back so i don't think you'll be bothered too much by elitists
---
Where was the anger ? In pointing out that clearly he started in the later expansions?
---
Im sorry, but undead rogue and your name is just so typical fitting. Its hilarious :D
---
&gt; you're so confused
---
all I said was 2.0 came out in vanilla.
---
3-5 private server guilds?? Lol, it's going to be waaaaay more than that. I think you underestimate how many private servers there are and how long they've been up. 
---
Even if people dropped out after a year of private server or even a few months, they developed a wealth of information and experience, not to mention relationships that they are going to carry over to Classic. For better or worse, private servers will have a huge impact on Classic, especially when it comes to recruiting. Obviously casual guilds won't care, but your upper level guilds will prioritize PS knowledge.

Just want to make one thing clear, alot of you may have heard that hunters scale bad from AQ 40 and forward. While this is true, it's only for PVE. Hunters scale just fine in PVP. In matter of fact they scale the best out of all the classes in BWL. If you can get rank 12 mixed with tier 2 gear in BWL phase you'll be one of the strongest PVP classes hands down. That 27% crit chance together with 5k+ hp is no joke so early in the game.
---
I love support roles.
---
Shammy and dudu I played
---
I didn't care too much for number padding.
---
Its nice to know that, x wouldn't do y if I couldn't do Z.
---
So I enable others, bring control and buffs for others.
---
The fun for me is that it's a great group class, and I like groups
---
Wicked 😂
---
Depends on what server, every new fresh has its own dynamic with either majority horde or alliance
---
But still, why would you pick a Ret pally over a rogue or DPS warrior?  It's fine if people want to play as Ret, but they're doing it knowing they will have limited exposure to endgame in their current spec.  I played a warlock and affliction was my favorite spec, but it had no use in 40 man so I didn't take it.
---
There's way better shit to farm if you wanna shine, like tubers.

yep. its become a bit of a problem actually lol. but i am super excited for classic and eagerly await every blue post or hint of an update
---
Again, you're coloring the current situation with your personal beliefs and judgment of me. Smooth.  
---
I'm in no doing this to hoard karma upvotes. If anything i expected to be down voted since i could imagine this being perceived as being nit picky.
---
I think some of the issues are things like people leaving after the first wipe in a low level instance. Once classic hits I think there will be a lot of dying in simple dungeons like Deadmines as people adjust to a new way of pulling, CC and fighting. Hopefully with enough new players, people will be more willing to take an extra hour to experience the real difficulty of Vanilla and learn how to play again, but more experienced players may, understandably, be less willing to "waste their time."
---
Someone get thie carebear a soft tissue and a safe place so the meanies wont hurt his wiw feewings. People might be mean to you on the internet get over it sissy boy.
---
The only argument I could see is that people would be able to measure their DPS on a static target with no mechanics (near meaningless) and use that as some sort of indication of how good they are. Or for groups to demand it. LFM DMN 600+ DPS ONLY or some shit like that.
---
Still, you wouldn't want to group with those people in the first place, so who cares I guess.
---
Completely depends on your guild and your luck. TBC+ was no longer 40 man raids, so you can't really compare the two. As an example though. My first 60 took me about 2.5ish years to get t1/2. My second, which was a rogue took me only 5-6 months, however I rerolled factions with my guild which had just broken up, so I was already with a slew of players I knew and was essentially promoted which gave me easy access to faster gear. Bear in mind, I had pleeeeenty of competition still, I was just the officer in a loot council guild. 
---
 But this is all assuming you're actually able to get into a good enough guild to even raid.  
---
 When the servers roll out, everyone will be experienced unlike the first time around, even those who never played it will be "expert's". This will either make server progression very fast, or very isolated. 
---
 Somewhere around the third quarter of vanilla I headed my own guild. It was tremendously difficult to find lose random players to fill a raid group at first... Although, because I was aware of all the fights till half way through naxx, and the server was fairly geared, we rolled into bwl pretty dang fast. During this time my friend had stopped playing a lv 58 warrior, I snagged his account and geared him t1 in basically two weeks. I hardly had to even play it TBH, just parked him in the raid and tossed him everything that wasn't an upgrade to my tanks, which was almost everything.
---
Anyhoo. Hope that helps.
---
The DM North farm might make it live, too...
---
What if they prevented faction imbalance on servers instead of xrealm bgs? Doesn't that solve more problems?
---
Thank you! Not OP but I've been trying to find out why no one goes aimed shot at 20 right away. I always thought it would be worth the strong damage
---
You’re “perceiving” it that way because it is that way. It’s pointless drivel. There are real issues to discuss.
---
Do you get to keep your title after reaching r14 if you stop pvp etc?
---
I'm kind of #Nochanges for barrens chat, it's a nice amount of silliness that generally only occupies one zone. My only private server experience was original Nost but even between original Vanilla and private servers I never noticed that barrens chat was that aggressively bad. I am pretty good at using the ignore function though.
---
I picked up a newer one. It took a few days but now I can't go back to the gen 1 anymore. This just seems so much more stable and better built now. I'm also looking at other mice for after this one. My partner went with the Roccat Nyth and it's also quite impressive. Especially because you can change the button layout.
---
2.0 altered a lot of game systems in preparation for TBC content. At this point, there was no turning back towards traditional vanilla game progression &amp; most people were looking ahead to the new expansion.
---
I remember when they did that, I was blown away by the quality of the quests :)
---
Just run around stormwind /yell lok'tar ogar for the horde!....yeah...that'll show em.
---
Water totem that AoE cures poison periodically
---
T2 Paladin / MCP next please !
---
I couldn't agree more. Azeroth and Northrend were designed so *organically* and beautifully it's unreal. They feel like *real* continents. They're just so expansive and believable. In modern WoW the zones feel like "theme-parks", with a zone having many different and varied "attractions". Sure, zones are more interesting/have more going on in them, but they really do feel artificial. 
---
Vanilla (and WoTLK) captured the sense of landscapes/zones so well.
---
Yeah but thats not what i asked though but thanks anyway.
---
Yes thank you.
---
Sure, but that doesn't change the fact.
---
Some people like being the bad guys and world pvp is perfect for that and because of them, local heroes are being made. This is what I love about open world games like wow. You are part of the living and completely unpredicable story. There is no linear pve scenario here. Pure chaos of life.
---
TLDR: if it's red it's dead.
---
Alcaz isle
---
That's more like Lake Tahoe. An oasis on the edge of a wasteland lol.
---
It can take a while, most of the time you will still need gear from the raid when the next raid tier comes out.
---
There’s one sword and three daggers from MC and one sword from Ony.  Horde side you will have a easier time getting the swords because you don’t have to roll against human warriors.
---
The rings will be tougher to get because all melee/hunters/tanks want them and you aren’t even guaranteed a ring will drop during any reset.
---
Getting T1/ T2 (head and legs) gear depends on how many other rogues your guild has as well as the frequency of the drops.  There could be a specific piece that wont drop for months while 4 rogues all are waiting on it.  You most likely won’t have all the MC gear you want before BWL comes out.  
---
I would find a hardcore to semi-hardcore guild horde side if you want to get geared up as soon as possible.  I prefer loot council but you could make a deal with the other rogues in a DKP guild where all of you will bid the minimum on tier gear so you can outbid the other classes on the shared gear.
---
Once BWL or AQ is out you can do PUG soft reserve MC runs on the side to increase your chances of getting the specific piece of gear you still need from there.
---
A big part of the problem is that hunters get almost nothing out of AQ40, though at least their Tier 3 is good. (Turns out spell damage to buff shots nobody should ever use isn't very helpful...)
---
Easy solution that pservers generally dont offer and we know will be in game: play on a normal server.
---
PvE will be crushed with or without PvP gear, consumes too stronk
---
Relatable.
---
I don't know much about lua or addon scripting.... but certainly there is a way to cut the first ~2000 loc into something around ~50 using some kind of dictionary object. 
---
Great idea tho.
---
Interesting thanks. So you its very likely you will still have some prebis gear on while raiding t2?
---
Hi, /u/matthook
---
&gt; I don't think realism in video games works. Something will always be "off". 
---
I think it's just that with realistic graphics we need a realistic scale. Most MMO worlds, like Azeroth, are much smaller than the real world. This includes things like forests, roads, and cities. The more realistic they make the graphics, the less we're able to decompress the world in our imaginations.
---
I think [Bless Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SkobtbuzYM) was able to create a good sense of scale to match it's more realistic graphics. Unfortunately the rest of the game was pretty bad.
---
The vanilla private server population is suuuper friendly and helpful but give ppl a heads up if you haven't done something before and they will explain and walk you through it. If I ask something i Wchat I susually get 5 whispers right away
---
I don't particularly care, I'll be playing holy. I just find it silly to perpetuate lies and unresonable behavior.
---
You can‘t narrow classic down to 4 playable specs and classes. Even if they are less effective in terms of damage dealt, there are lots of other purposes for those „non viable“ specs. Everything ingame is doable with cookie cutter specs we proved it back in 2006 when we downed C‘thun with retris, ferals and lots of hunters.
---
The only changes I'd want is more graveyards and faster gryph travel. But you gotta watch what you say because the #nochanges people will have your head on a spike lol.
---
It's not pointless. There's a bigger picture of authenticity at play here. There is no "real" or "unreal" issues, There are bigger and minor issues. All of which contribute to the authenticity of the experience we all had. Obviously these are prioritized for a reason, but it's our job as a community to present these issues so that they can get some attention.   
---
Did you play back in Vanilla and why is this pointless drivel to you? help me understand your logic.
---
Thumbs up for Pooch.
---
Pretty sure you need at least 3 but preferably 4 to cover every enrage on fights like Chromaggus.
---
For a true vanilla experience, I’m not allowed to play until south park does an episode on it.
---
I don't care about being ganked now and then even if it's unfair circumstances, but one thing that is lame is corpse camping
---
It's acceptable and fun in places like nesingwary's camp because it turns into a huge grudge match and almost brings back the original idea of towns and npcs changing sides (eg you can only go to nesingwary's to hand in quests when your side is running the show) which i think is awesome
---
But if you're in desolace and a few randoms are corpse camping that just becomes pointless griefing.
---
I'll sometimes gank unfairly if it's funny, but usually i leave lower levels to do their thing, and even if I do kill them I'll leave it after that 1 kill
---
Yeah it's definitely a slightly different distribution on each server, but I don't think I've seen one that's favored Horde yet. It's always a matter of just how dominant Alliance is. On a big server that launched about a year ago, it was nearly unplayable as Horde. You were outnumbered about 3 to 1 just about everywhere.
---
Sorry, I’ve just realised I’m feeding the troll. Has a nice day.
---
Yeah the art team is killing it more than ever with WoW. Vanilla graphics are nostalgic, but otherwise not as beautiful as the new zones. I don't necessarily like the Cataclysm changes, but zones like Drustvar, Suramar, etc. are just gorgeous. 
---
I agree totally that it's a layout and game design issue. I rarely get a strong sense of "place". Quests are numerous, extremely quick, and therefore forgettable. Mobs are evenly distributed, easy, and behave the same. Pathways through zones (and especially dungeons) are very limited. So you always feel like you're on rails.
---
I dunno still meh to me. Yeah you go up against the lord of elemental planes, old gods and KT but you do it with an Army of exceptional individuals. I absolutely hate going from that to being considered Azeroth's sole savior. Story doesnt mesh well with me when I know theres more people involved.
---
But I see your point =).
---
Until one slapps you in the back of the head with full reckoning
---
Just because you can get by doing something does not mean you should consciously choose to do it that way.
---
Interesting. Good points. I’m bumbed out that I’m getting voted down, but I’m going to leave this because your reply adds value to the conversation which wouldn’t otherwise exist. Thanks
---
when i first started getting into private servers i joined a guild called "Spit Lubed BAnana Voyage" which apparently started because a bunch of guys got sick of nofun all serious guild they were in and decided to take wow a little less seriously...
---
we had 1 guideline: Always do things the hard way because "if you dont do things the hard way you dont stay hard" and 1 motto: Spit lube is best lube. was a great group of people and i miss them and the ridiculous stuff we did.  
---
On Nost was just getting into Sen'jin village with my mate and we come across this Tauren who was fishing in the pond. asks us if we want to join him for some fishing and offers us free rods. We naturally say yes and proceed to spend the next half hr+ chatting and fishing while he added more people to the fishing group offers us a guild which will have "regular fishing events" if we are interested. We join not really sure what to expect cause he is only lvl 16 and we arent sure what kind of fishing events can be had outside of booty bay. But fuck me we had daily fishing events at wailing caverns for deviate fish, we would go to hinterlands and fish off the docks there visited the nat pagle and showed our respects by doin some fishing, was a great laugh!!  
---
Yes alot of people/guilds will be serious progression guilds that are unforgiving and i think this is a lot of them on private servers at the moment as they practice getting everything down pat for when classic releases. However this isnt everyone and wont be everyone on classic. There will be people who have never played classic before, others(like myself) who have played before but arent really interested in the progression race but just love the way the game was rather than what it is and many others im sure.  
---
TLDR find the right guild with people you like and if you find yourself with a bunch of twats leave for more fun people :)
---
Dear god I hope not
---
Sure, you could camp it in the sense that you'd know within a 30-40 minute window or so when the zone would start repopulating lotus again. But having a general idea of when the zone would respawn is way different than being able to time an individual node down to the minute like you can on some private servers.
---
You talking about being able shine, but I found Hunter did that far moreso. Kiting is really a form of tanking and only very few people in the raid do that. Also, pulling trash in AQ40 certainly put me in the spotlight more than a spot on a DPS meter in a sea of other DPS ever did.
---
Im pretty sure anyone thats ever complained about arrows being an issue or money drain never played Hunter before. Very easy to farm as Mining/Engi. As for expenses, I found Hunter to be the CHEAPEST class I played. You have the lowest repair bill of any class because of FD, the only consumes you ever buy are arrows, food and Elixir of the Mongoose. The only other consumes you can get are all mana related, which if you have a few Runes and Mana pots, thats all youll ever need.
---
The rewards are different.
---
In vanilla the PvP rewards, when introduced, where worse/similar than the raids you could do. They were worse for raiding but had more stamina so better for pvp. After a while raiding gear just got better and better. So blizz updated the pvp gear, which became as good as high tier raids (AQ and Naxx).
---
So in vanilla pvp gear was either similar or worse than raiding gear.
---
With the current content plan we will have the updated pvp gear when low tier raids will be available. So the pvp gear will be vastly superior from the raiding ones.
---
Another big change is the playerbase. MMO players are much more into min/maxin now. Everyone farms for the same BiS gear nowadays while in the past information didn't really go around as much. As such, more people will realize the pros and cons of ranking.
---
That's not really accurate, though. It's not really less complicated than most other specs, but most specs aren't at all complicated to play in vanilla. Ret paladins have to manage seals, judgments, and different ranks of consecration depending on Vengeance procs. It's not very different from, say, Rogues spamming one ability until they can use slice and dice again or Mages spamming frostbolt or Warlocks spamming shadow bolt.
---
Thank you, #nochanges is something we should all come together on, not argue about.
---
Yeah, I only played through GW1 to a certain point, but it was really unique.
---
LB was definitely horde favored, I think K2 aswell
---
Y'all are gonna hate me, but there are SOME things that are typical of hunters -- that you just gotta love.
---
1.  "I don't have any more ammunition..." when you're 1/4th of the way into the instance killing mobs.
---
2.  "Anyone have any food they can give me?  My pet needs fed.  No, he won't eat fish, only meat."
---
3.  "I need to repair, I'm all red!"  Usually 1/2 through the instance.
---
4.  Times the feign death so that he/she is standing near the healer, feigns death so the mob can quickly grab the healer.  This is skill.
---
5.  "Rolling on this - hunters can use this weapon / armor drop."  "I need to skill up on bows, even though this has +dodge or +str on it."  (Clothies are usually safe.)
---
6.  Uses no other shots in rotation except auto shoot.
---
7.  Pet is always on aggressive, pulls immediately when aggro is noticed giving the group and hunter no time to FD to reset the pull.
---
8.  Never traps, hasn't trained freeze trap, and says "traps don't work anyway."  Little does he realize what 3 seconds can accomplish in a hard battle.
---
9.  "Can I get some water from the Priest?"
---
10. Melees instead of trapping / resetting the distance.
---
11.  Backs up for distance and pulls more mobs in an instance.
---
12.  "Anyone have MORE food for my pet?"
---
I had the luck of playing with some great people who actually pulled all of these on me with one of the new re-rollers to the server.  We were helping him get geared up with instances, etc., and this was the running joke, he was the "huntard of all huntards" and at first, I was in shock -- and then I just laughed and laughed.  
---
But we've all been through the jumping down to start the event in UBRS, and all of a sudden, out come the dragons from the gates, and meanwhile, dragons are coming up from behind from the pet who didn't jump and pathed around the corner and down the ramp.
---
:)
---
But I still love 'em.  If they use a macro to target the mob on the healer and send pet in with growl, pet is healed, just like a tank.  If they trap, FD and re-trap (it quirky but worked in 1.12 on Nost, eager to find out if it will work on Classic 2.0) they are golden with their healer.  That goes for PVP as well, if your pet is attacking, it's getting healed if the player is dumb enough to continue to fight it.
---
Smooth exit. What a way to be constructive. Boasting hyperbolic personal insults and comments to refute the topic at hand with no agenda to back up your words.
---
Lol what? Yeah, of course they had a release date. It coincided with Warcraft's 10th anniversary.
---
My experience is completely the opposite. Some people are aholes but the majority are friendlies. Just like in other MMOs.
---
They're really fun. A good hunter has tons of control in 5mans, but really shines solo and in PvP. Also, the bow quest is one of the most fun and challenging things I've ever done in WoW, and I did it *last year* on a private server. I liked it more than the Mage Towers in Legion. I think that speaks to how enjoyable hunter can be.
---
I've only played my paladin to level 30 something during vanilla. I stopped playing him when I couldn't kill the witch doctors in STV because they healed more then I could damage them between the 1 min stun cooldown... But I did tank a lot heroics on my paladin during TBC.
---
Differences I can remember.
---
 - Not a single ranged spell, no way to pull but body pull. And dynamite has a cooldown https://classicdb.ch/?spell=3931
---
 - No taunt, neither single nor the AoE taunt.
---
 - No active burst. No Crusader Strike.
---
 - You didn't get mana for taking damage.
---
It just felt very slow and static. Not at all godlike like the TBC version.
---
I haven't healed a single dungeon ever on my paladin... can't say anything about that.
---
Literally unless they do the shittiest damage, don't pot or gear they are still giving every dps in the raid 200 atk power. Not bringing a few paladins is stupid.
---
Tauren!
---
so sensitive
---
Cheers, you lot making this decision easier every minute. 
---
I was planning on rolling a Mage but I’ve played mage to death. I’ve always enjoyed mucking around on a Hunter over the years and I think it’s time for a change.
---
Nope I just looked at the thread and realised nobody else is commenting and realised you are just replying to me for attention so I decided not to feed your trollpost.
---
Again, have a nice day. Next time post something relevant to the sub.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not making the argument that raid leaders should take a Ret over a Rogue or DPS warrior.  You can’t argue with the numbers.  But filling a 40man raid roster was tough, much less filling it consistently, so to say that Rets will never be able to raid is a stretch (I realize that’s not your point, and appreciate your phrasing with “limited exposure”).
---
The post I was replying to essentially said that bring a Ret was a net loss for the raid and where I was going was at most you need 25ish heavy hitters and generally can fill the rest of raid with whatever you want, including a Ret.  If I were a RL, my biggest concern with bringing a Ret would be with Judgement/another debuff I believe they have that auto applied pushing raid debuffs off the boss.
---
Not everything is about raids.
---
I passed by a shield slam crit spec prot war build that looked pretty crazy.
---
But it doesn't teach pulling / selecting a mob / resetting for instances.
---
Grind a couple of levels to get to a higher zone? From level 1-20 there is an abundance of quests.
---
Should I name my hunter “XxLegolasxX”, or something a bit more sophisticated such as “TreeSixtyNoScope”?
---
...
---
^^/s
---
Horde does not have Paladins. They have Shamans.
---
Just as a pointer for the future, read tactics before entering places so you know what to expect for each fight, and if you mess up be the first to say "sorry my bad i know what i fucked up on", it reassures people that you actually know what you're doing.
---
Personally if i get a mythic + group going and some guy is failing a lot and fucking up my key its really annoying cause ive no idea if he actually knows what to do.
---
Do you have any sources?  Every source I have found says 1 per zone at a time with around a 1 hour spawn.
---
For sure, and I’m reading that the bracers of the eclipse from Dire Maul, and two trinkets: black hands breath and hand of justice are BiS until T2.
---
You can mouse turn and click spells at the same time? It's kinda impossible
---
Where are all these assumptions coming from? I'm responding to you because you commented something of interest to me, not because i want attention what the hell.  
---
Just because you believe something is irrelevant doesn't mean it is. Keep going buddy.
---
The moment I saw that Vampire The Masquerade 2 was getting released in 2020, I knew hardcore playing WoW was over.
---
I WAITED SO LONG FOR BOTH OF THESE GAMES AND THEY GET RELEASED SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. WTF.
---
As always, the community will be a mixed bag.
---
There are actually some options in the exact 31/20 you choose to use, specifically around (IIRC) whether you want entrapment and how many points you put in monster slaying.
---
When you're playing a class with literally zero healing, it makes a huge difference.
---
HAVE A NICE DAY
---
There are probably a few dozen effective specs, not 4. But I don't see why this is relevant.
---
&gt; Everything ingame is doable with cookie cutter specs we proved it back in 2006 when we downed C‘thun with retris, ferals and lots of hunters.
---
Yes, because they got carried by the rest of the raid. But what is the motivation for the carrier? Why should they tell their family that they are going to play 6 hours to do what should take 1.5 hours?
---
They are basically "cooldowns" that drop a visual totem now.
---
But now, they don't have things like strenght of earth and grace of air anymore.
---
People need to surround themselves with likeminded people instead of complaining about the jerks.  Noone is forcing you to play with elitists if you want to he casual.  Noone is forcing you to bring boomkims and ret pallies if you want to full on poopsock it.
---
Yup, I plan on doing that. But I'll have to be a really fast leveler to manage this, since every hunter will try to tame it
---
Shamans cant dual wield in vanilla that talent came with tbc patch 2.0
---
Don't worry. In next expansion Sylvanas will travel back in time when Azeroth was invaded by orcs. It's going to be called Warlords of Azeroth. Everything will make sense again kind of sort of.
---
Really good abstraction, my dude.
---
The ambience of the game alone is why I went ahead and picked up two subwoofer speakers and a mini-fridge of Monster Energy drinks. The immersion is incredible, brother.
---
Found a great countdown timer that confirms this! 
---
WoWClassicCountdown.com
---
No, but you may be one shot by a 2h wielder
---
Honor farming isn't usually the goal of WPvP, it's usually banking, griefing, /lol-ing and /spit-ting ;)
---
Oh, sometimes a touch of /cry and /golfclap, too hahaha!
---
Man I miss the good old days lololol!
---
Pish, Form over function my friend. This is classic, most of your gear is just spirit anyway.
---
With /sit not working i guess its not a viable specc for leveling kinda sad, and you cant use it to get stacks from hunter/wl pets.
---
But i guess better then nothing, counters every melee abit,
---
Because the private server mentality is: oh you will never run out of mana if you just use rank 1 multishot and your pet for everything. you never have to sit and drink hurr durr
---
Plus a fair amount of them still lives in the pre 1.9 time (when beasts didn't just keep some abilities like Lupos dealing shadow damage, they also kept other mods like speed, base attack power and immunities) None of that is going to be a thing. We get normalized nerfed pets with poor scaling.
---
The 'no downtime' builds are all fine and good from a ''I want to spend as little gold as possible' perspective. But in comparison the XP per hour spent grinding of a hunter who has an aimed shot and with that an additional attack every 10 seconds  is way superior to the slow slug grind.
---
Even more so because Bestial Wrath is not a great sustained dps option. It's nice to have, but there is no reason to rush to bestial wrath. It gives your pet a burst cd. So what of it. You trade a timer to kill 1 target faster every 2 minutes over constant better dps
---
In terms of actual grind speed rushing the first 11 points into MM for aimed shot beats everything. Especially when you aim to quest and do dungeons (as you will have a semi-guarantee of weapon upgrades from time to time)
---
Don't get me wrong the other talents in BM definitely make the leveling process much smoother. But the 'get Aimed when you in your 50s ''to safe mana and rush wrath'' is just plain stupidity as far as I'm concerned
---
&gt; been playing for 5 or 6 hours and they only just hit level 10 
---
Oof. Must be a *very* new / inexperienced "returning" player to hit that benchmark pace
---
Interesting. I had the initial impression that it felt "cheaper" than the old one. Well at least this makes me worry less about having to replace it if it does break.
---
So the patch allows WF to proc from itself?
---
This is hands down the weirdest conversation I've had on this platform, gotta admit. oh well. you too :P
---
More Dots!
---
im thinking of going hunter, but ive been playing in a private server and i dont like that i haveto feed my pet every 3 mins to keep him from running away. As i level up i think i heard that i dont have to feed as much. is this true? also, around what level does it get better and how much better, like how often will i need to feed
---
Thanks the info! As inconvenient as it sounds I played a lot of Holy, and am used to not being a great solo character.
---
Well, I did it. I caved. I'm playing a hunter in classic.
---
I had my whole plan laid out - I was going to be a priest and be everybody's best friend. Then I realised that if I didn't end up enjoying healing I was basically screwed. So, I'm going with the old faithful - I mained a hunter from 2005 until quitting in Cata (then came back for WoD/Legion), never raided Vanilla, only did up to Gruul/ZA in TBC. So I'm "finishing the journey" so to speak - Rhok'Delar/Naxx in Vanilla and, if we get TBC servers, my ultimate end goal is Thori'Dal.
---
Sure, you recognized the few people who pugged constantly, the trader swith all the recipes who were constantly advertising, the few good pvpers, and the few assholes who were absolute bottom of the barrel. And then you had a few thousand other players who were for the most part anonymous.
---
The best guild on my server was filled with complete assholes, who on one occasion ninja'd an item from a pug and disenchanted it in front of him, according to the guy who was spamming about it for hours in trade chat. You know who gave a shit? Nobody. At no point have I ever heard of any of them struggling to find a group. 
---
You can be the biggest piece of shit on the server (as long as you don't go over the line), and still clear all the content with ease as long as you are good enough. This goes double if you are a healer or tank.
---
No, but players have *considerably* less HP than in other expansions. Pre-AQ, you're looking at 3kish health pools. That's *almost* one-shottable by a pure Blue pre-raid BiS enh Shaman who gets a lucky WF crit swing and an earth shock.
---
So just like the title suggests - I put together a list of my 5 favorite tier sets from WoW Classic, but I'd like to know what other people think. I figure there'll probably be a lot of...Judgement (bad pun intended), but lemme know! ;)
---
You know what’s nice about a 15 minute cross country gryphon ride. Bio and drink breaks. For dungeons I like everyone having to put in the effort to show up to fight your way to the instance door.
---
Oh yeah, it's already started. The elitist scum are essentially trying to make people feel bad about their guilds, their classes, their races and their specs. It's fucking annoying and anyone playing a video game like that should be ashamed of their attitude.
---
You may take your raids seriously, but that doesn't mean you treat a game like work and treat your guild mates like raid-slaves.
---
I also think that a lot of this will be Horde VS Alliance player base. In my experience Horde has always leaned towards being toxic compared to Alliance. I have always been Horde, but for this reason, I am rolling Alliance. Everything I read seems to point to this being accurate. You obviously will get a lot of nice players on each side though.
---
As someone who has leveled 11 separate 60's on x1 private servers over the last 3 years I can definitely share some of your sentiments. Especially the teamwork aspect, grouping for quests, genuinely needing someone's help rather than just doing it because it will be faster. It feels more like an RPG than current wow. With less of a focus on aethetics and more on gameplay.
---
This is awesome, I played a prot warrior basically from launch until TBC came out with only brief deviation to various alts.
---
I’m not planning to Tank this time just due to the shear number of hours it takes to be a truly successful raid tank  between resist gear, consumables, gold farming, world buff item farming and rep grinds being a great tank in Classic for raiding is a young persons job haha!
---
But I am really concerned about not being able to get groups for 5 and 10 mans to get geared up as a dps or heals. Being able to see which classes require the least dungeon gear for pre-raid bis is fantastic!
---
Shit man that was no joke back when they were two minute buffs.
---
We're addicted to a game we're not even playing yet
---
When mountains and trees are far enough, they become a blue silouette.
---
In vanilla, you could only see these from so far away. In live, you can see the silouette of the World tree on top of Hyjal from the Barrens.
---
I would not mind if the silouette rendering distance were increased and if this setting were optional.
---
As someone who played a healer, a warlock doing Hellfire either meant he was stupid and only looking at the damage, or our group was close to wiping.
---
Its a great panic button that is clearly visible to everyone else. I like it.
---
I mean this is what pve servers are for. Problem solved.
---
reee
---
???? Are you living in your own little world?  Go check other threads in this very subreddit about it... no doubt that finding a raid slot will be possible on Ret, but you are deluded if you think it will be *easy*.
---
Why play ret pally when your class also can be the best group PvP healer in the game?
---
I did heal on a priest and druid and made the paladin as I wanted to see how healing as paladin works. Never finished leveling it during vanilla and when I finally did during TBC going tank was the role more in demand.
---
Now I'll get a second chance. I will finish leveling a paladin this time and heal everything up to UBRS! (After leveling my warlock, of course.) :-)
---
I would much prefer this absolutely. It would have to be proactive rather than retroactive though, and I'm not sure if Blizzard has plans on balancing severs from the start when there's a potential that server populations will plummet after the first month.
---
Your whole argument boils down to one of your bullet points, that you say there's no way 8.2 and classic can be launched in the same time window. I say you're wrong there. This is because they dont compete with one another. They don't compete because they are the same source of revenue, subscriptions. Even if classic takes retail players, they are still paying the same, they don't cannibalize each other. If anything they get more revenue from the new customers, thousands, that are unsubbed currently that will come on with classic.
---
I say 8.2 and classic are simultaneous. 3rd week of June, when I'm on a work trip...
---
 *"Rolling on this - hunters can use this weapon / armor drop." "I need to skill up on bows, even though this has +dodge or +str on it."* ***(Clothies are usually safe.)****"*
---
I always get hate for rolling on the drops from Arugal. Int, spirit, agility and stamina. Perfect stats for any leveling hunter, my pet does the tanking so I don't really need the armor. What do you guys think?
---
Shaman can't dual wield in vanilla
---
I was thinking the same lol. Should be 12 or so within 3 hours max
---
Honestly, more than you'd think. All it takes is one Guild.
---
2.5 warrior.
---
Human: muh ligh
---
Gnome: aww shit what know
---
Dwarf: it was sober
---
Elf: muh trees
---
Orc: zug zug
---
Troll: the vodoo told me mon
---
Tauren: need more grass
---
Undead: least find how to kill all
---
Yes. Eventually you can go several hours without feeding your pet. It gets better as the loyalty level increases. At loyalty lvl 3 it’s less of a pain, and lvl 6 is when you can go hours without feeding. To go from loyalty 1-6 takes maybe a week?
---
Have you seen the latest blue post? It includes the pvp release schedule integrated with the existing stage releases. By the time people can get R13 weapons (3 months after honor system is released), it will not trivialize PvE content. Of course it will help, but it’s there as an alternative way to gear up.
---
I think I'm going to stick with a pserver until I get through Redridge just to see if PVP servers are for me. I haven't seen any world PVP besides getting ganked on my way to the deadmines and once in Loch Modan. Those instances weren't all that bad, but also weren't particularly fun. I can definitely see myself getting into world PVP. There are no battlegrounds at release right?
---
It's all based in loyalty level. At max level you only need to feed the animal every few hours
---
Please pimp your website so that we might criticize and/or support you.
---
Well put, and yeah I know what server you're talking about. It got pretty bad at one point. Very true on the respecs and open world Pvp without BGs during Phase 1 as well.
---
1. Ive only done that once...
---
2. Seen it plenty, never been a beggar though myself.
---
3. I definitely would say Hunter does that the LEAST with FD. Def moreso with the other DPS classes pulling threat constantly and saying that after dying once or twice.
---
4. Definitely seen this and then making no effort to help the healer.
---
5. Havent seen this trope as much as people claim. I mean, I saw a Hunter roll need on a Felstriker once on a pserver, but that was the worst of it and it doesnt seem to happen often.
---
6. Just a meme really, havent really seen this.
---
7. Yeah, pets should honestly be passive by default, even pets on Defensive, like when the tank is trying to pull around a group, the Hunter starts DPSing and the pet cuts a corner and pulls.
---
8. Sort of? Ive seen people not use traps, but usually when you ask them there isnt really an argument.
---
9. More of a general thing than Hunter.
---
10. Eh, sometimes it is more useful. Better than that one time I saw a Mage doing this in Strat UD so he could ninja every single scourgestone. And yes, he actually meleed instead of casting anything.
---
11. More of a general thing again, pet does that job for him anyway.
---
Uh you realize i meant the douchebag running people off right by being a jerk right? I was agreeing with you not arguing.
---
DnT represent aaaye
---
Haha thanks friend! Much appreciated
---
No it won’t be impossible, unless you’ve got a full time job.
---
I hit 60 on my rogue in January 2006 and joined a new guild that had just started in ZG/MC. TBC came one year later and the guild had cleared MC, ZG, AQ20 and had just started BWL. At that point I was wearing mostly T1 but still had several blue slots including my offhand weapon and trinkets. Gearing up was slow unless you joined an established guild - out of all the times we killed Onyxia I saw the T2 token for rogues drop once.
---
We used the Suicide Kings loot system which I much preferred to the DKP systems we used in TBC onwards.
---
I like the paladin as (other than very high end content) you can heal and tank to a reasonable degree, so fill in whatever roll is needed.
---
Blasting people with shadow bolts is undoubtedly very fun!
---
&gt; Stacks never drop off unless you switch out the weapon, or I think if you take a zeppelin, receive a summon, or some other 'disconnection' from the primary world.
---
Are you sure about that? The [old blue sticky](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm) includes mounting up in their list of things that'll drop your stacks:
---
&gt; **Why didn't my Reckoning bomb go off?** 
---
&gt; The following things can cause you to drop your charges: 
---
&gt; * Ending a Duel 
---
&gt; * Mounting up (including gryphons) 
---
&gt; * Autoattacking too early (e.g. from out of range) 
---
&gt; * Switching Continents 
---
&gt; * Switching Weapons 
---
&gt; * Losing control of your character (Fear, Scattershot, Blind, Polymorph, Mind Control, etc.) 
---
The author of that posts still exists and provided [an update](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20767637953?page=2#post-38) regarding this matter:
---
&gt; As for mounting: if one had 4 Reckoning charges and then mounted--they're gone. However, one could Acquire Reckoning charges while mounted and retain them after dismounting. I would (ab)use this to charge into Orgrimmar/Grom'gol/Cenarion Hold and bomb someone before the guards/duelers would kill me. 
---
Also, I have seen videos from people that were supposed to contradict this, but in some of them you could clearly see in their combat log that they were mounted up, tanked some crits and were healed back up by their friend before the clip started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2jg2bZp8MM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=138 You can even see the Redoubt procc still active on him.
---
I'm posting this because I'm genuinely interested in how it worked in vanilla, so if you have something that contradicts this, feel free to post. I'm happy about every bit of information I can get.
---
So many variables such as racial abilities and gear would affect outcomes, even outside of "skill". 
---
I guess if you equalized everything, Shadow Priest and Rogue would be the strongest picks from what I remember.
---
Theramore has dummies and Blasted Lands has invincible NPCs.
---
Loving and caring your family should be your highest priority
---
If it is not, reflect on that
---
I don't have any source other than my own personal experience, I spent probably hundreds of hours herbing, particularly in winterspring. There are some old comments from 2004 by people speculating how black lotus worked, but that's hardly solid information (and really not any more rigorous than my personal experience either, I wish I had left a wowhead comment back then lol). 
---
I do agree that the respawn was roughly 1 hour though, but it was variable (like +/- 20 minutes) and based on the zone and not individual spawns.
---
Ah understood. We won't be getting those pieces until phase 2 if I'm reading it correctly so it's safe to assume gankers will be scarce during phase 1 but more prevalent during phase 2. However once phase 3 hits BG's will be released and will be much more profitable for honor gains if I am understanding how it works correctly so they should dial back down. 
---
As for the playerbase changes you are correct, we have a lot more information but that goes for both factions. If one faction is farming honor in one area then the other faction will want to farm them and so on and so forth meaning that while one may get ganked by farmers, it is probably safe to assume their will be like-minded individuals on the other faction as well looking for these people. 
---
We also don't have a release date for each phase, so it could take months or even a year to get from one phase to another. So it's hard to tell how that will affect the raiding and the PvP scene. Also doesn't this mean that getting the PvP gear on a PvE server will be near impossible during phase 2?
---
To be fair, all of these things can happen when grouping with a hunter. However, when you get a GOOD hunter in your group - it can change the whole pace of an instance/quest.
---
Noone enjoys far gy runs, but its needed, so you would really not want to die. therefore your existnce in the game more exciting.
---
thats one of the major design features, not a flaw. If you'd only add long gy runs to retail wow and leave everything else the same, its instantly would change the feel of the game. why would you care not to die, if its not a big deal. make it a big deal, and the worth of your existence go up :).
---
as far traveling goes, you can use this tme for socializing, later with your friends. one of the reasons barrens chat is the barrens chat cos this zone is massive and there is a ton of traveling.
---
I can say I've seen both ends of this, but lately it seems like a botfest (at least on the leveling end).  I think there will be a more diverse mix of people on classic launch than in the pserver community.  You have to go out of your way be there and I feel the casual passer by is few and far between.  All of that to say, with the more diverse crowd in Classic, I feel the atmosphere will be overall less intense.
---
Hunter pets will crit 20%+ of the time if they are beast mastery spec anyways so its still a good way to get free stacks =P
---
You're correct tho reckoning by itself is not a viable leveling strategy.  But AOE farming as a prot is doable, but you have to gear a bit for it and buy a shield spike which some people would consider wasteful since you're "just leveling".  But you get a free mount and don't need many of your abilities til level 60, so you'll have available gold!
---
This is how I feel about it and it's why the roleplayers I know are looking forward to coming back just to RP in the classic world. The new game has a lot of polish but it feels like it's also lost of a lot of it's original soul. I understand the artists would probably be annoyed but the original world was built as a labour of love and it feels like a good dungeon masters setting to me. Post Wrath it's hard me for to appreciate the areas unless I take interest the real world culture that inspired it like the Mayan, Inca or the Aztecs empires for Zandalar. To me it's like the difference between an old version of Warhammer Fantasy and the most modern version of Age of Sigmar. It's just not for me I guess.
---
I played Dark Age of Camelot before I moved to WoW and the private servers for DAOC are the same way. Elitist super nerds who have played the game so long they know everything there is to know, so any mistakes they jump on to make themselves look/feel smart. 
---
TL;DR - Learn from your mistakes but don't let the terrible attitudes of jaded super virgins ruin your fun.
---
1. Paladin T2- Judgement
---
2. Warlock T3- Plagueheart
---
3. Warrior T3- Dreadnaught
---
4. Mage T3- Frostfire
---
5. Shaman T3- Earthshatter
---
6. Priest T3 - Faith
---
7. Warrior T2- Wrath
---
8. Rogue T2- Bloodfang
---
That only happens in corrupted guilds where the GM plays a ret paladin or something.
---
I meanb thats great how you remember things from 14 years ago but many more people believe otherwise.  You shouldnt call things bullshit when you are the only one seeing it that way.
---
I think any toxicity will come from the streamer hype babies that THINK they know how to play because they watched (popular streamer name) and youre not doing something the way they did it. But after the first month i bet most of those people will be gone anyway.
---
try noticing your feet. Are they there when you're not looking at them or touching them?  
---
Pretty quickly I'm enjoying my time in bed.
---
Isn't really a way to tell if you remove skill there are so many variables. Assuming at lvl 60 and comparable gear and pots etc. Usually who ever gets the jump on you. 
---
That being said I've had every class jump me and have turned it around as a warlock many times. 
---
On the other hand I have been literally 2 shot by hunters with lupos and an aimed shot. Unless my reflexes and ping were good enough to sac VW there is no way I Could have won that fight.
---
I mean, this very may well have been the very first pull of Onyxia outside of internal Blizzard testing ever..
---
Me, except without the girl next to me.
---
Yep, I do.  I just hope people find better solutions to these issues when classic launches.

Yeah the corpse camping is what gets extremely lame. I knew a friend who literally got camped for an hour. I just can't get in the head of someone who has the mindset to do this to lower players. I can see raiding a town with a few buddies because that causes some cause for high level players to come help out, but one 60 rogue camping your corpse probably won't be a big enough issue for high levels to make their way to a lowbie area. You're just kinda fucked.
---
I'd rather have good pvp gear early than wait until the end of the game. Those are our only two options.
---
&gt; Mave vs Warrior
---
lol
---
I hope there's a supportive community. One of the worst things that happened in retail was growing impatience and intolerance in PUGs (thanks mostly to cross-realm LFG). I want the vanilla feeling back, and that includes talking to each other, helping each other, and occasionally wiping together without then shouty ragequitting about it.
---
I was in the same boat. Started right after BC release as Horde, ended up maining a Paladin.
---
I played a bit on pservers to see if I could main Alliance. I can't. 
---
The other main thing I discovered (for me): Enhancement Shaman feels better then Ret in every situation that doesn't need big defensive CDs.
---
It's more fun to level, and a million times more fun when doing DPS in Dungeons. Totems are huge and really strong. Blessings are strong but a lot less fun.
---
If Vanilla/Classic had Crusader Strike, it would be a lot closer. But it doesn't, so actually playing the Hybrid Melee spec just feels better as Shaman.
---
If you haven't played on a pserver yet: I recommend actually staying away from them and wait til Classic. The Nostalgia is pretty real, and I stopped playing on them just so I wouldn't ruin it. Walking into the classic Orgrimmar the first time was really awesome.
---
I'm starting to have dreams about release now too   :|
---
Wut? I used to win most of the fights as mage, but I've also been one shot by intercept and MS
---
I think in this sub we see a lot of the more “hardcore” player base, so there’s a lot of that kind of “oh goodluck getting a raid slot with *that*” and similar attitude thrown around. In reality, the majority of people playing will be far more casual and unfamiliar with classic at all. Honestly, most players probably won’t max. And that’s fine. Honestly, that’s a good thing imo. I’m sure there will be some players that keep that “hardcore only” attitude, but in general the game will be more open to new players and ret paladins everywhere.
---
That's a good source, you may be right.  I've only done reck on pservers but I have done it a lot, and I've listened to what others have said about how it worked in vanilla.  
---
I know for a fact in pserver those stacks will stay with you for things like mounting, getting sheeped, feared, or by somehow "autoattacking too early" whatever that means.  I've never tried to generate stacks by dueling and then /forfeit so I can't speak to that. 
---
I'm curious how it worked 15 years ago too =P  But I know at least in the version of code that pservers run it doesn't matter if you get feared/cc'd those stacks are still stored until your 1st melee attack lands.   I often would sit back and heal in BGs generating stacks (I use a reck-counter addon) and I feel like I was able to mount if I didn't use them after the fight and still have them for the next one.  But often I would just run into the fight after the initial cooldowns and burst had gone out to try and finish off a lower player and drop my hammer on a useful target.
---
Many more people = 4 comments from 2004 on wowhead, ok. 
---
And most of the folks who treat pserver lotus behavior like gospel never even fucking played vanilla wow.
---
lolret
---
/obligatory
---
Unless it is a war or pala, at about level 50 they float 2.9k to 3.2k usually. Spot on though
---
This as well. This exact situation, as /u/cluke01 already stated in the thread, has happened recently on a popular private Vanilla server. The result? The population of the server declined by nearly half in the time period, because the camping was so ruthless and no one could get anything done.
---
A lot of people have been suggesting shaman, and it is nice to have some more depth as to why, especially from a paladin perspective, so thank you!
---
Yeah I am trying to avoid private servers so I can have the big nostalgia trip for real.
---
Great review but with that being said:
---
Roll Warrior and let us know your experience.
---
I dare you :)
---
Me, except my wife is almost as excited
---
Sorry you're getting downvoted, yours were valid points to bring up and I'm sure a lot of people see that as well, but it's not the way people will rank on Classic.
---
Haha thats me. 
---
Also... What class I’m going to main? Hmm hunter with the pets is easy leveling. But warlock is nice to... Mining with engi or 2 gathe.... Zzzzzz
---
This guild sounds great, only one question - is it a casual or hardcore guild?
---
Did I ever say that? I said that anyone that thinks a 1% difference in total raid dps per ret is a deluded.
---
I am also fully aware that in BFA a shaman is/was considered literally worthless because it simmed 5% less than other classes.
---
When DKs where used in the m+ invitational people started acting like all the other tanks were literally unplayable to.
---
And I even understand their retarded logic. Because they are terrified of taking agency of their own gameplay, they desperately cling to the meta. Because if they don't, they risk having to become a better player.
---
This is even true in league of legends.
---
Here's my experience after playing. I finished dun morough at level 9. Loch modan was a bit high level, so I grinded up on gnomes until level 10, did my class quest, then headed over there. After getting to 13 in the loch the quests started getting a bit too tough for me so I went to westfall until lv 16. Then went back to loch for the final quests and finally returned to westfall for Deadmines. Which is why I said I probably would have had to grind a bit to handle the quests in one zone. Traveling to other places is how I avoided that. Maybe I just didn't optimize my quest path.  Could definitely be the case!
---
Will be funny when those pserver elitists hop on classic and realize their whole play experience has been a lie. Hopefully classic community will not end up toxic and be more like it was back in Vanilla, helpful and welcoming. Judging by this subreddit alone (fans who are really interested in Classic, and would be elites, not elitist), the outlook is pretty good :)
---
It's the experienced, good players who will have no issues with this because they can take on the lead, mark enemies/pats, explain the mechanics, tell people when to drink up etc. which makes it easier for everyone. People who don't want to take time for this will just skip dungeons all together until their mid 40s anyways.
---
Engineering, consumes and trinkets make it highly variable. Also a huge part of 1v1s is how the engagement begins. Hunter is also probably the worst dueling class because of the small dueling are, are we talking about duels here?
---
Generalized;
---
Hunter vs those classes, the Hunter should win if he starts at max range and the other classes are dismounted. If hes careful, they shouldnt be able to close the distance, unless of course they use consumes to close the distance. If not, theres a whole lot of IFs based on how the fight starts and what positions theyre in.
---
This was the closest response thus far to the classic "Go play Hello Kitty: Island Adventure" meme, have an upvote
---
Haha you're probably right, but I feel like that's going to be a theme with people that have been out of the game for a while.
---
If you take skill out of the equation as you said, and we pretend that both players have equal gear, there is absolutly no way that you should ever lose to a warrior as a mage, unless you play arcane but let's be honest; arcane in pvp? what kind of person does that..
---
The types of hunters:
---
Type A... The Huntard: sits and drinks during a bossfight. Raids with carebaear mc muffin, doesn't know what potions are, runs with copper arrows as they are cheap and will try to absorb all loot that he/she/it can equip
---
Type B.... The Average Joe: uses aimed- and multi-shots on cd but clips autoshots and falls off in terms of raid dps post MC
---
Type C... The Google Monkey: follows simple advice to weave autoshots between aimed shots and multishots, knows how to chug down mana potions every 2 minutes for the rest of his/her life. May stay relevant up to the end of BWL
---
Type D... The Sim Moron: dual wielding, opts for solo dps simulations and swaps T2 out for T3. Will stay on range and complain about poor scaling as excuse for being bad once AQ40 and Naxx ship. Is basically a huntard with access to some guides, but no understanding for the core game mechanics to make use of it. Will pick every option for personal gain over actual raid usefulness or raid utility
---
Type E... Rangers: know their way around proper autoshot weaving and are aware of the empty spot during an aimed shot cycle. they use this timeframe to feign death to swap out trinkets or to use grenades Will put up a decent performance in AQ40 and Naxx
---
Type F... Gods: stick with wolves and marksman spec to boost raid dps over solo dps unless the raid fields entire hunter groups in which some roll survival, sticks with t2 and uses 2 handed weapons. position close to melees whenever possible and fill the empty gap between aimed shot rotations with a dive/dance to bridge the 3 yard deadzone. Is aware of both the melee and ranged aspects of all fights. Get envy/hate of all other types of hunters and make sim morons cry in a corner after every raid.
---
Beware of type F. Unless you catch one off guard or pull off a miracle they will never allow you to get into their 3 yards deadzone unless they want you to &lt; add freezing trap sound effect here &gt;
---
Ah okay, that's good to know then. thx
---
3 yards is 2.74 meters
---
Most complaints about cross realm BGs are that it killed that chance to find people from your server in your BG. Why not just cross realm, but modify it to fill from your server first, wait 2 or 3 minutes max to see if the BG will fill on it's own, then cross realms the remaining open slots.
---
Mine would be something like:’”I could still be downstairs playing Classic right now if it were out.”
---
The super-crazy bug set? &gt;\_&gt;  
---
Well...different strokes for different folks, like I always say ;)
---
Thunderfury should go to the paladin tank, cmon!!
---
One of them in fact did. Rhymes with bright raven.
---
What’s the story? You’ve got me curious
---
Remember, feign death doesn't work against warlocks. We still see our dots ticking on you.
---
I also seem to remember Blizzard stating that the maximum view distance would be limited to vanilla's.
---
That's good to hear. I really want to get aimed shot ASAP. Glad to know I'm not crazy for doing so!
---
Glad to see another fan of Plagueheart. It's definitely in my top 10 for sure. Seems to get a lot of hate from what I've heard.
---
All good. I’m sure you’ve seen this movie before on private servers. Good to know what to expect
---
It's almost as if different people have different experiences...
---
Admit it. You felt like king of the world getting shoulders.
---
Yo man, that would be Yuber i think :) Wasn't Eyetoyo a hunter from Verve?
---
I played horde in vanilla and alliance from TBC to know. And my buddies and i have decided on horde for classic...but its going to be really hard for me not to want to play alliance. I have an alliance tattoo (its small) so going horde is like going against my beliefs. But i technically played horde in vanilla and it would be a nice change. Its really hard for me as well. My biggest concern is faction balance. I dont want to get stuck as an alliance player on a horde server getting constantly ganked/not being able to get groups together. I hope the pve servers are like 60/40 and the pvp servers are 50/50
---
Agreed with all of that. I really enjoyed the sense of danger coming back!
---
i thought it was to cast chain heal
---
I was there! Probably tanking the shit out of huhuran. First flask i ever popped was for huhuran.
---
Private server community is super toxic. 
---
Grab some friends and jump into Classic together and have a blast! Or, do like me and just play solo if you don't have friends. 
---
Original Vanilla was the best community wise, yeah you had trolls and jerks and elitists, but the majority of the people were super nice and helpful.
---
It will be way worse in classic than it is in retail.
---
Whenever it releases It will not be a problem.
---
My buddy is making a prot warrior. There were a few instances of long pauses and "I'm going to get a fucking drink."
---
It is relevant because you claim that it is carrying other ones when they don‘t play the as viable considered specs/classes like furys, mages, warlocks and rogues.
---
I really don’t get the carrying point honestly. How is it carrying other ones, when you kill the hardest boss in a raid together? You could’ve take 10 warriors, 10 mages and 10 warlocks the outcome would’ve be the same. Our members did their best and tried to get everything out of their spec. Nobody felt like we were carrying our retris and ferals. Nothing took 6 hours. We raided 2 days a week for 4 hours. We were a big family, after 2 yrs of playing together 30 people of our guild met IRL.
---
Your point is antisocial but if you are a hardcore progresser I get you.
---
Axes are fine on alliance, every tryhard fury warrior will have Edgemaster’s Gauntlets wich gives +7 weapon skill for whenever they need the skill.
---
LEE DO NOT
---
this is an overall solid pick for a pvp build:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZgVohthtcbfVkh
---
you usually want 1 point in trap mastery because this will be just enough to pretty much avoid the vast majority of trap resists in pvp.
---
the points in survivalist and improved wingclip are interchangeable. for my taste 10% more life is great but if you feel like you want to push your procc chance on improved wingclip than go for it. the rest is a must imo.
---
TIL people didn't play wow until late 2006.
---
The spiky feel of t1 with the dps of t2.5, especially when you're dual wielding the axes from bwl.
---
I can't tell you how many times I had bad luck and got mortal strike crit by this guy when tanking him.
---
He doesn't even hit that hard but his knockout punch (MS) comes out of nowhere sometimes.
---
We saw it very recently on a private server and the result was population peaks of 5k being reduced to 2.5-3k within a month. It declined even further since then, and they had to remove some of the changes they made to PvP to stop it from getting any worse.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/399432771?t=1h11m48s
---
You have two jobs
---
On release, no. After a few months, yes, it will be basically the same. 
---
I think retail players are actually more "forgiving" than pserver players, so that will probably rub off a bit as well. But just the fact that there will be so many noobs running around requires people to relax a bit about it.
---
This is something we all need to keep in mind when we play Classic.
---
Back in the day everyone was a newb, made lots of mistakes, had weird gear combinations, etc. and we still got through everything just fine.
---
There's nothing wrong with educating players throughout the leveling process but try not to be too uptight or demanding. DO NOT be an asshat... it's a social game and that can/will ruin it.
---
A character with the name "magegirl". Without the capital letter at the beginning!
---
A &amp; D are strafe, turn with your mouse. E is my go to spellbind for my most used spell. Just make the transition, keyboard turning is just so slow, it won't help you
---
I'm bored and excited too, but cmon.  /r circlejerk
---
Is tier T2 better then T3 ??????
---
True dat
---
Older graphics, and modern games with simple graphics, are "stylized" rather than realistic. Think of how cartoon characters are visually distinct and clean without being realistic. It's the same effect. :)
---
Nexus Crystals ofc
---
Ah sorry about that, I didn't realize that was the case. I've passed that along to our CSS guru and hopefully that'll be fixed up soon.  
---
Otherwise, you'd need to just search for them based on their title/flair.
---
Mage is really unpleasant in Vanilla. Pretty good dueling class, but grinding sucks when you have to drink so much, you get completely shit on by warlocks (and locks are going to be a lot more popular now because the secret's out), they're boring as fuck in most PvE, and you're a glorified water cooler. Bleh.
---
What do you think is the best mitigation for individual players, such as stealth? I’ve been coin flip on mobile WPvP as hybrid Druid, rogue, or just going pure holy pal healing best I can with unoptimizable plate (for pvp).  Sounds like it doesn’t matter ,ugh but stealth starts to look more attractive
---
Under the assumption that both players are good, meaning above average skill and PvP orientated:
---
1. Hunter, Rogue, Druid are the kings of wPvP because they can pick and choose their fights and have very strong dueling power.
---
2. Shadow Priests and Warlocks don't have the engage/disengage mechanics of the above but pack a seriour punch and have multiple ways to self heal/protect etc. on top of really strong CC in fears, silences, charm, dispell and so on.
---
3. Mages are just always strong and versatile in any situation or content type. Not *quite* as powerful as the above in wPvP 1v1s but can beat just about everyone.
---
4. Warriors, Shamans and Paladins kind of suck alone but make more than up for it when grouped. Just as an example: If you are a fresh 60 in dungeon blues and one of the classes in point 1 you can beat epic geared Warriors consistently in a 1v1 if you play the matchup right, that is how bad they are in 1v1s.
---
Purge is a thing too
---
Great, thx for your reply
---
I play X class at X faction in vanilla. It was fun.
---
Yeah you probably missed some dun morogh quests like the one to ninja the meats from the ice beard cave. Should be enough questing to get you to level 12
---
Oof.
---
As a former warrior,
---
Hunter vs. Warrior, you die.
---
Mage vs. Warrior, you die.
---
The end.
---
It won’t be anything like private servers. That’s literally the 1-5% of player base that will be spread across many NA and EU servers. It’ll be much more casual than people think on majority of servers.
---
only for the one glorious time till 1.9 nerfed it (and all pets were normalized aside from their swing timers. Previously they've kept certain passive boosts like dmg type, health, runspeed (alterac frostwolves were faster than epic mounts))
---
Oh the sweet +100 % dmg bonus how I miss thee.
---
??? There are people who have been playing since 2010 or later...
---
No...more people equals every source when you research this stuff.  Show me any source that agrees with you.

"WELL DUDE, HAVE FUN CLEARING MC IN 4 HOURS INSTEAD OF 1.5 HOURS. SEE YOU IN 1 YEAR WHEN YOU'LL STILL BE IN BWL WHILE I WILL BE FULL T3."
---
\- An asshole elitist
---
Classic 😂
---
That's a very normal amount of hours for casual players. I've been playing vanilla servers for the past 3 years (since Nost launched) yet the druid that I made a few weeks ago hit level 10 in about 4,5 hours.
---
Not everyone is a speedleveler or hardcore player. Your comment comes over as slightly condescending. Most people on this subreddit are hardcore though so the average hours on this sub would be much lower, but over the entire playerbase your average player definitely needs 6 hours to hit level 10.
---
This, and always consider that everything in this game is time consuming, and time is in short supply for quite a lot of the player base. While it's certainly not a fault to be a new player, it's also certainly not the responsibility of others to teach you, but plenty are willing if you are up front with your limited experience.   
---
In my experience in the MMO genre, the player base responds well to those who don't know but want to learn, and shuns those that don't know, believe they do know, and refuse to consider any other way. No matter how much you Lok'Tar Ogar or praise Elune, were all still Human and there's always going to be plenty of toxic assholes out there.
---
Most of it seems right, but loss of control doesnt. This was over 10 years ago, but honestly it just doesnt sound right from my experience playing it. I guess it could be right based on what he said, because if a Rogue stuns me hes probably building my charges in the stun anyways. But for Fears and Polymorph, I cant even remember specific situations but it doesnt SEEM right.
---
He's thinking early classic, which did have 10 man LBRS, Scholo, and Strat and 15 man UBRS. It was changed to 5/10 man in one of the earlier patches.
---
Hopefully Classic isn't actually out alongside WoW's 15th Anniversary (November).
---
Fair enough. I was most likely still not completely remembering that you need to look for some quests in Vanilla, it's not really hub to hub like in retail. Probably would help to do a bit more exploring!
---
finally a role that suits my skills   
---
*proceeds to drop wrong totem*
---
People act as if there's this giant glut of weapons coming into the guild and everybody gets to be picky. What really happens is that you have a pile of rogues and furies fighting over maybe 2-3 1hander drops per week and you take what you can get your hands on and are thankful for it. 
---
Not to mention dwarf, nelf, and gnome warriors exist, and axes like Deathbringer and Chul'shoruk are still quality weapons.
---
&gt; People probably don’t appreciate it too much cause flying mounts take it all away.
---
I think im one of the few people that feel this way, but flying actually makes me appreciate the world more.  Its really nice to be able to get a 'full' view of it all, and see the impressive landscapes.
---
I stopped playing in wrath of the lich king and never played cataclysm, was Cataclysm a good attempt at reviving the old world? Many quests in the old world made no sense either as the threat should have been dealt with when finishing some quests. It is however quite important for immersion that either the quests are designed so that you dont "solve" it, the attacks can still continue or doing what they started doing in wrath with zones in different stages depending on which part of the quest you are at.   
---
On the point of immersion, I understand that they are limited by time and resources, but adding Quel'Thalas instanced in the world and leaving it like that is still something I cant forgive them for. Or how they solved the whole "no flying in azeroth" in tbc with a red message in the middle of the screen "You cant use that here". Yeah that makes perfect sense...  
---
Also spaceships, how someone thought that spaceships was what warcraft needed is beyond me  
---
They really gave up on the old world after the first expansion already,
---
Yeah, the only thing that annoys me is the Trump 2020 type shit. That is the exact outcome they are looking for with that behavior, though. So, I'll never verbalize it in game.
---
Me. Except she's saying "when are you going to book your vacation? Ive booked week x, y and z already"
---
It's been one per 10 or so days, pretty consistently. Next week will probably have more news in it, or so i hope.
---
why didn't I just think about that in the first place?!?
---
Were you the guy in the tank group that kept dropping TA by accident?
---
It's a toxic bigoted cesspool on the current biggest vanilla pserver. I'm fine with silliness, not with what amounts to straight up hate speech.
---
You both, had me in the first half
---
I hope this is a joke lol. They are one of the harder classes in the game to be good with. Sure farming gold is easy but playing PvE and PvP optimally is a different story.
---
Yeah I should have also mentioned I went with the Dwarf starting area because I am not very familiar with it. I imagine when I go with the human questline I will be much faster because of prior knowledge.
---
actually true.
---
He’s going to need more than one!!
---
exactly this. this was a passion project and its easy to tell.
---
These days on private servers they do fair damage in early raids (MC+BWL), because bosses actually die before they run out of mana. But...
---
1. You'll be spending a small fortune on mana potions and consumables even when bosses are on farm
---
2. They scale very poorly with gear.
---
3. Because you scale so poorly, the gear that drops is better given to other spellcasters.
---
4. In long fights, your own DPS is pretty neglible because you will run oom.
---
5. You get really fucked by the debuff limit. Having a SW:P be removed before it's done any damage is a massive waste of mana and dps.
---
6. More room for error and potential to get screwed over by bosses which require movement, due to their primary damage source being channeled and thus front-loading the mana cost.
---
7. You do an absolutely stupid amount of threat, so you often can't go full out on damage even if you have the mana to.
---
Many guilds will bring one because you increase the damage of all warlocks (and have _some_ dps yourself). Some guilds will bring a healer specced into shadow weaving instead. But, make no mistake, the reason you are there is 100% because of shadow weaving, at least past BWL.
---
Totally! Don’t want to be trapped in the uncanny valley! It breaks my immersion!
---
Exactly. Have to use those Flights for bio and to get up and move around some, get some snacks, etc. Hell even do some push-ups or squats or something to get the blood flowing.
---
When I wake up too early for my alarm and go back to sleep I usually think, "If Classic was out, I'd get up right now and not go back to sleep."
---
I never saw the world after they fucked it up with Cata.
---
You mean to tell me they fucked it all up a second time?
---
If your lucky to be the token enhancement you totem twist.
---
This is a correct statement.
---
Azuremyst was the first place I ever set my feet in Azeroth (I started playing in TBC) and to this day it still is my favorite zone. I leveled up my Draenei to about 15 and went Horde instead, and didn't see that zone again for a very long time, but it always stayed with me; I would go through the trouble of going there as a Horde from time to time. The atmosphere, the music, the colors, a specific memory of me exploring the first quest hub and finding an earth elemental (I think? Maybe fire) alone at a certain place and then wondering what was it doing there and when would I be able to interact with it, everything was so beautiful and peaceful despite the crash.
---
I loved Quel'Thalas.
---
I don't see why they didn't just copy it into the original map. Guess they didn't want to do the terraforming.
---
Im pretty sure that was the camera zoom youre thinking of.  Isnt view distance how far away you can see things from?  like...the 'fog' and whatever is farther out.
---
Yes, it is very important to distinguish that a min/maxer and elitist are not necessarily the same type of person. A min/maxer is someone whose enjoyment of the game is derived from doing everything optimally. An elitist is the same thing, but they expect everyone else to behave the exact same way as well.
---
I mean the art style of DAoC was more realistic, and they did a good job designing textures, but the graphics were very primitive compared to Vanilla WoW, it's not just the art style. Those screenshots you linked, the models probably have 1/4 the polygons of a WoW character model. The lighting, background textures, and model detail are all much more complex in WoW. The art style is just the cherry on top. 
---
I played DAoC when it came out (great game!), and the preview screenshots and alpha footage from WoW blew my mind. It was cutting edge for a MMO at the time. Game engines at the time were shit at handling open worlds - HL2 and Doom 3 looked great, but are essentially series of small rooms, corridors, and skyboxes with frequent loading screens.
---
While things popping up out of nowhere isnt exactly the same, its really not crazy to think that you'd be able to see a massive tree, hills, etc from farther away than a 6' tall character.
---
Horde have no business in Redridge.
---
You weren't ganked by Horde in Redridge, you were ganked by assholes.
---
If you guys want more in depth on Hunter all the time you guys should check out the discord.

I don't have a route on hand but a lot of people on [barrens.chat](https://barrens.chat) website have done many speedruns and posted results. Consensus is that NE is pretty quick 1-10 but not as quick as gnome or human. However, Auberdine is great 12-18 I believe, and is quicker than other routes (iirc). Your buddy should actually look to meet up with *you*. As long as he gets his lv 12 spells, should be fine until 16/18 before needing to go back, and it'll be pretty quick for you both.
---
&gt;It has nothing to do with carebears or crybabies
---
But how will I sound super tough without using terminology like that? 
---
Good, discussion-worthy post, OP.
---
I've noticed the first 40 levels of playing Horde, the Alliance are all lv 35+
---
Why can't I walk into Hillsbrad at lv 20 and encounter an Alliance player who is my level??
---
Yeah just like Tom and Jerry still looking amazing.
---
Guess youre against having phases too then? #nochanges.
---
it was the go-to excuse to raid with your pvp spec ;) that's all there is to the mysterious SV outperforms MM. Only if your guild runs full hunter groups (whereby you know that you can leech trueshot) can you - and your raid - benefit from a SV spec.
---
I agree! The art department is consistently amazing and is the one thing that hasn't gone downhill.
---
Thanks

In 1.12 the lvl48 caster only has a [24% chance](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614015831/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Magical_resistance) for their spell to hit the lvl60 who is ganking them. When the lvl60 has double the health and can hit twice as hard, two lvl48 casters don't stand a chance.

Stealth will help a bit, it's way harder to camp a Rogue than a Paladin or Warrior, but it won't work 100% of the time.
---
SP rogue is good fun
---
Right, I wasn't making any claims of the technical superiority of DAoC or anything like that. It was released by a small studio 3 years before WoW, so of course it's technically inferior. Classic WoW is also technically inferior to any modern game. That's all kind of irrelevant when we're discussing art style and design.
---
Nice. I would recommend grabbing a starving mountain lion in hillsbrand when you hit level 23/24. Attack speed 1.2 which is damned good for caster push back and if you miss out on BT should substitute nicely until you grab a bat at 60.
---
Not being condescending, just think I may be pointing out the fact that I don't personally believe a *returning* player would net that time played for lv 10, unless they are taking a much, much more lackadaisical approach, or  leveling up professions. Just for reference, 1hr 30 is near the fastest 1-10 speed for any race, and 2hrs is the time for a "good" speed run, again, any race / class 1-10. So adding 4 more hours for someone who is familiar with the game is a bit unlikely, unless grouping, professions, etc-
---
I don't disagree entirely though.
---
as long as we are staying in classic and this project never moving onwards to BC - ammo is fine.
---
In BC you're going to pay 2g per 200 shots. Timelost arrows and bullets ... I honestly don't miss those :p
---
So you get triggered by people posting their political views in general chat? Lmao
---
They're from MC, I had the main-hand one on my warrior.
---
yeh and how many people do you think will rank to 11+ for the epic pvp set.  itll be minority of players.
---
I think you're what everyone in this sub wants to be.
---
this is valuable information. thank you!
---
The correct answer is to drop Wf totem 41 yards away from the boss, and after 10 whispers drop it in melee range when boss is at 5% HP
---
Ive seen this argument a few times but no one ever gives any specifics. Ive compared 1.12 blue sets for 4 classes (sham, rogue, hunter and warlock) and at best the sets are essentially t1.5. For warlock and rogue they are halfway between t1 and t2, but you can even argue they are worse in some instances such as the rogue blue pvp set having 0 agility, essentially losing 4% crit over t1/2. Hunter blue set is complete garbage even when compared to just t1. Shaman is irrelevant because youre healing in pve and you can get way better healing gear. And warlock blue pvp set is like I said better than t1 but worse than t2. 
---
Obviously there are other classes that I haven't looked into but you're making it sound like the 1.12 blue pvp sets are t2.5 equivalent and its trivializing bwl and its gear. Which it certainly isn't. At best I can see people taking advantage of the 2 piece set, and incorporating it into a bis list. But thats far from making bwl gear irrelevant (which DM before MC release would do). 
---
Not to mention take a lot of effort to get rank 10 with just world pvp. Even with bgs you have to put in some effort into the honor grind and thats a constant stream of honor via objectives and ppl rezzing at nearby graveyards. World pvp honor gain is going to be way slower. 
---
Again I would love some specifics. Because at this point it just sounds like a bunch of bs that gets echoed without anyone actually looking at the numbers.
---
It's really funny to see this from a present day perspective. From second one you are wondering why they are not turning her around at least and then you realize that this wasn't a generally known fact in 2004.
---
Not even gonna hate. I thought it was obvious I was kidding. The fact it wasn't says a lot about the struggle of the poor ret paladin.
---
I *promise* that you do not hate meta whores the way I do.  It is unhealthy.  At any rate, I hate them, but nevertheless accept that they get their way because their way is effective... face it, Ret is simply sub-optimal.  Far beyond sub-optimal.  Even the absolute most tryhard rets cannot even **compete** with lesser-geared/skilled rogues, furies, or even ferals.  You have a lot of utility to offer to make up for it, but it's all utility a Holy paladin offers - and they offer it better.  Ret is simply a bad spec.  That doesn't mean you can't get a raid slot in, but it will make it a lot harder, and I promise you that even if the difference is as small as 1% rdps (which I doubt, but don't really care enough to check) that is still justification to say no thank you.
---
50 agi aka 100 ap and a 50 ap set bonus
---
vs 450 range ap for every hunters per proc with the possibility ofmultiple procs being active at the same time
---
No battle grounds at release but also no reason to PvP other than for the sake of it. Phase 2 will introduce PvP rewards and Phase 3 will give BG's.
---
This :)
---
I could've sworn there was an accompanying part if the script that helped increase the view distance, but you are correct. This was just for personal camera, not view distance.
---
I can agree with this. I hadn't considered camping in my initial post. To clarify camping is not a part of the cycle it is an abuse of it.
---
"smaller and weaker"
---
Couldn't have described the Alliance better myself. :D
---
All joking aside, I'll be on a PVE server this time. I don't like griefing players so I don't intend to be griefed while leveling.
---
I'm looking forward to putting lots of stress on my healer while dungeon leveling by big-dick-tanking 2h in berserker.  Idgaf.
---
* Druid: i like all their sets, pretty cool. 8/10
---
* Hunter, all but dragonstalker looks a bit meh apart frm the shoulders n helm. 7/10
---
* mage, i like all of them. 7/10
---
* paladins, i think judgement is a bit cool but overrated, so i prefer tier 1, however ive always loved tier 3. 9/10
---
* priests, i like all of them 7/10
---
* rogues, i like all of them. 7/10
---
* shaman, love em all. 10/10
---
* warlocks, pretty good. 7/10
---
* warriors, dont like tier 1 but love t2 n t3. 9/10
---
i just gotta mention tbc cos the warrior tiers were epic, same with the tier 4 n 5 paladins, n many other classes - loved that expac
---
If you want rank 14, juste find a team. The worst choice to do is trying to get it by yourself.   
---
A team is AT LEAST 10x more efficient than pvp alone.  
---
Yeah you still need to play A LOT to get R14 but not 24/24.   
---
Something like 8h/day who is still full time job xD.  
---
if you have a decent team getting rank-10 is not that much time consuming.   
---
back in time i played like 2-3 night per weeks and got it quite easely.  
---
I even got arathi's and warsong exalted items who are quite nice.
---
I recently did 1-20 on a private server as well and this is extremely accurate review.
---
Yeah I really don't mind a wipe if it's just honest mistakes or inexperience. I would be happy to take time to explain the mechanics and teach people. The only thing I ask is that people that suck, realize they suck and are willing to listen. There is nothing wrong with being a noob. We all are in the beginning.
---
Yeah. I went freelance over a year ago. I am loving the flexibility and independence, but the chance of being able to take a full week off for launch is pretty low. Not just the money - more importantly, not disappointing clients.
---
I'm better than easily 95% of the player base, and because of that I am most definitely more valuable than the vast majority of players.
---
I also don't mind wiping in dungeons or teaching some things to a noob.
---
You’re not alone brother.
---
Awe she isn’t old, She’s just getting broken in
---
Do you really believe Activision would release something and not expect a profit? What kind of drugs are you on?
---
Well maybe but it is not like Blizzard has this great track record of changing things for the better though.
---
Its kind of funny to me. The modern player has honed their skill to such a degree that they are able to 'minmax every bit of fun away'. They are so knowledgeable that all raid content will be a joke and PvP ranking will only be possible by following the most efficient method possible.
---
Yet they still haven't learned how to roll on a PvE server if they don't like getting ganked relentlessly.
---
Thanks for your insights OP, really interesting.
---
Can't wait to play Classic again!
---
yeah , not even to mention other classes like paladins that want something half decent in a melee weapon just so they can tank or grind.
---
gearing is stupid slow in vanilla when nosses drop like 2-3 items and there are 40 people , at least about 20 people are not getting everything every raid.
---
its great that it takes forever because when you have good gear or see people in good gear its cool. vanilla is pretty legendary for loot drama mostly because there was not enough to keep 40 people happy every raid. if you cant keep 40 people happy enough people wont show, guild will rip.

---
as someone who jumped on priv servers this week going to have to agree with OP here. Problem being we know all the quest locations so theres no fumbling around or extra farming. Real quick your yellow quests are gone and you are 3 levels below attempting the orange/red ones. Unless you want to farm 3 levels worth of exp just so you can try the next quest, bouncing around zones is needed.  
---
When you are sitting at 14 in westfall with your lowest level quest wanting you to kill level 18 murlocs its probably a good time to go grab 2-3 easy levels from another zone.
---
I'm looking forward to all of this but one thing that isn't emphasized enough is grouping. I'm looking forward to playing a game with a community that *actually wants to group up*. One of the problems with Retail WoW is it discourages much of the grouping outside of instances, so if you have a harder quest or something you actually want to group up for, it can be nearly impossible outside of endgame content. So I'm looking forward to bringing back that community aspect and actually being able to group with people when I want to instead of being forced to skip or solo.
---
Well, you've conflated being triggered with minorly annoyed, but essentially yes. It's not posting political views, it's being intentionally crass. If you fail to see the nuance in the situation, that's on you. I'm capable of having a political conversation with any idealogy, that behavior is something else entirely.
---
you hace way more hp, 3k is fresh 60 with few epics
---
&gt; This is also nothing to do with "elitism". You can be "elitist" and decline a moonkin, green machine or bodypuller from joining the raid nicely without being dick or toxic about it.
---
Nah. Elitism is when you think you are "better" than other people on a personal level. It can't be done in a nice way. Declining people from joining a raid has nothing to do with that, you can choose what classes/players you need depending on what they can bring to the group without being in any way elitist. We don't have any obligation to bring anyone into our raid groups, but we do have an obligation to treat them with respect, even if the spec they are playing is less than optimal from your point of view. 
---
On the other hand, there could be arguments made that elitism can sometimes be helpful. Like if you are in a hardcore raiding guild, actually pushing for a culture where highly achieving players get more respect will probably have positive results in raids. But it's a trade-off between that and having a more relaxed guild atmosphere.
---
Personally I'm stiving to build a guild that adopts a helpful approach to new players rather than an unforgiving or pessimistic one. Hopefully we can spread the attitude across the realm but it's inevitable that there will always be some that have no time for beginners or anything below their own perceived level.
---
It's very rational to be forgiving and understanding. Everyone starts with zero knowledge. Knowledge is something acquired through experience, time, effort, and so forth. That person with zero knowledge is the same as we were a few years back; there is no difference.
---
But there are some levels of bad that require punishment. The perpetrators crave that punishment. More often than not it results in their learning and improvement.
---
IRL we can't call people out on their stupidity 90% of the time since that would result in losing friends, losing jobs, etc.
---
Therefore since this is a fantasy game, and the bads within this game crave punishment, we should once in a while indulge in our fantasy world by communicating the stupidity of a person's actions.

Hunter will be my solo character when I’m not playing with friends. Any quick links to a guide?
---
If I actually knew how to code I could write it much better, that's for sure. Thanks!
---
How ironic that this is the most toxic comment in the thread. You must be European yourself.
---
it will not be fast, and ur "wannabee geared , gotta go fast" will cause you more frustration than joy
---
There will always be negative people but their bad attitude isn't the responsibility of other players. No one should be expected to lookup walkthroughs and guides for leveling dungeons and such. If that's how people want to play, that's cool, but they should be allowed to learn it organically like players did during vanilla.
---
I was a pretty big noob back then. The first time anyone called me out was during an SFK run. I was doing dumb stuff as a dps warrior like hitting the wrong targets, spamming heroic strike too much, and having bad positioning. Instead of getting pissy and bitching at me one of the more experienced players explained what I was doing wrong and how it was making things much harder for the group. I didn't suddenly become an expert, obviously, but my group play improved. That was my first experience with the Kentucky Fried Gnome guild... lol.
---
Anyway, people that get angry and act out are at fault and no one else. That behavior isn't even valid in raids or premade pvp groups... though at level they're right to expect players to know what they're doing for the most part.
---
Assuming your guild LC’d based on individual merit and not need (which is the more common LC), a middle of the pack rogue could expect to be about half kitted by month 4 in something other than prebis.  1/4 of your gear will last into BWL because there’s no mc replacement, and the other 1/4 won’t drop in a high enough quantity to get to you yet.  The average alliance guild brings 4 rogues to start, (which usually drops to 3 by AQ) 3 hunters, (2 by AQ). And close to 10 or so Warriors pending the spread on the other classes.   To get a ring, that’s at least an 8 week wait, assuming it would drop every single raid.   I’m about 6 months into progression on Northdale and none of our healers have a second ring yet, despite clearing every week.
---
It starts to sound like a semantic argument :) But people sometimes call you elitist by not allowing them in group, when in reality I don't want to take 3 hours to do what should be done in 1.
---
"YOU'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS SINCE I LAST SAW YOU, GOOD JOB. SAW YOU STRUGGLING WITH THAT NAXX GEARED LOCK GANK SO I THOUGHT I'D HELP YOU OUT. GOOD LUCK WITH BWL! YOU'RE GETTING THERE."
---
-elitists with style
---
Come at me bro, my totems are ready
---
"Dont worry, I wont" - Me, Later Summer 2019 probably
---
That sounds painful for the healer. Why you gotta make healer bro struggle? :(
---
The Tier 3 tokens are shared with Paladin and Druids. Even if your guild prioritize the Paladin and even the druids in front of you, it's the less sought after tier 3 tokens. With 5 or 6 paladins, 1 or 2 druids and 3-5 hunters. You're about 10-12 people looking for that particular tier piece.
---
As for T2 vs T3. It depends on the amount of hunters in the raid, but you're almost certainly not rocking full tier 2 on every hunter anyway. So the gearing process goes something a bit like this.
---
Example assuming 4 hunters.
---
T1 = Hunter 1 &gt; hunter 2 &gt; Hunter 3 &gt; hunter 4
---
T2 = Hunter 4 &gt; hunter 3 &gt; hunter 2 &gt; Hunter 1
---
T3 = Hunter 1 &gt; Hunter 2 &gt; Hunter 3 &gt; Hunter 4
---
You gear up Tier 1 from one end to the other, then tier 2 from the opposite end, then the original gear up path at tier 3. That way, you're not upgrading from tier 2 to tier 3. You're upgrading from tier 1 to tier 3.
---
Further more. The set bonuses provides mana regeneration on crit (6 piece) and offers a mana discount on aimed shot and multi-shot (8 piece). Which is not a big deal on Alliance, but does allot for the horde hunters.
---
I think Gen 1 was a little rough. Personally I think Gen 2 nailed it
---
Hunter is Easy Mode compared to order classes. But Evan The  1-20 is pretty fast for all of them.
---
30+ is where The journey begins.
---
And after every single person in the raid makes their tiny mistake that only cause the one full wipe, it's time to end the raid with 0 progression to show for it.
---
I personally won't be playing in a guild that does this kinda shit, but if you're playing with hardcore players, you need to match their standard. Otherwise you're just wasting 39 other people's time.
---
Nobody care about that russian shitserver though.
---
its even weirder to me playing big horde races, because the gameplay is so much more fast paced lol
---
I've always felt this way with books too. I don't want to hear about every excruciating detail of the wood work. Just tell me its intricate and let my mind fill in the blanks. Less is definitely more. It's why I couldn't ever finish the Wheel of Time.
---
I have a huge love/hate relationship with 1-20. On one hand, you get the biggest power-leaps in those levels. You mentioned that axe that doubled your melee damage, or awesome abilities like concussive shot and a pet. From 20 and onward, the upgrades you get are less impactful. There are always huge moments, like getting portal spells, or your Whirlwind Axe, but 1-20 really fleshes your character out at a fast pace. 
---
On the other hand, 1-20 is the level bracket that I abandon a toon in most often. I'm not as invested in the character yet, my abilities are sparse, and I can't really do a dungeon, my favorite pastime in WoW, until 18 or so. 
---
But really, your post has me gushing with excitement about getting to start a new handful of toons this Summer. I think I'm going to start with my mains, a Pally and Mage. I'm probably going to get my mage to 15 or 20, then drop 20s to my pally, so I can buy a green weapon or some armor to make the 1-10 bit less painful. 
---
On the other hand, maybe I should go pally first, so I can get a hold of a lesser magic wand for my mage at 5. This is exactly what I love about leveling in WoW, is it takes so much planning, yet you can do whatever you want with it.
---
Yeah I'm just saying there's 2 reasons WoW aged well - art style and also a very advanced engine for 2004. People underrate how technically good the visuals are, and give too much credit to the cartoon style.
---
Yea. By... By accident.
---
"PRIEST DOWN" lol, least of your worries, mate.
---
minor detail, but it wasn't mana for taking damage, it was mana for getting healed by other players (no mana if you healed yourself)
---
I'm sure a lot of people are tired of talking about politics.
---
Most people don't even have a very basic understanding of how the system works. They just think massive hours or massive honor means increased rank. There is a lot that actually goes into it. But I appreciate the reply.
---
4 days played, yes. So about 8 days overall, assuming you go hard but not absolutely health-ruining.
---
I have a feeling this is going to be me, except as a dps Warrior.
---
You need to say things like i am new to this, can you help me with bla bla. Never seen any community help new players more than this one. Ask a question and you will get 100 experts ready to help you solve it for free. 
---
We are ready to grasp at every opportunity to use this vast amount of knowledge we got while playing. 
---
You probably joined a group, did'nt say anything about being a newb (in a 15year old game those are rare) and continued to make mistakes. People mistook you for an asshole.
---
Yeah the point is that "every source" is basically a handful of comments from 2004 and a couple blog posts (and that wowwiki info is copied from a wowhead comment). You can also find [sources](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-guides/2288-1-300-herbalism-alchemy.html) that say 2 nodes can be up at a time. The point is that there just isn't that much rigorous or reliable information available from that time.
---
There was nothing that made me want to play warrior more than that one video of a guy shrekking everyone with his shield bash. Though I think they patched/normalized the damage on that in one of the earlier patches. Can anyone shed light?
---
I too want to enjoy the summer lol I feel like it'll be September 
---
I mean don't games avoid the summer because of this? I remember back in like 2008-2012, always noticing a lack of releases during the summer, but always before and after.
---
I'm not being funny, but this is a ridiculous question.
---
Of course there will be a release date.
---
I've read weapon skill has diminishing returns. Does that mean if you have Edgemaster's, it's not a huge DPS loss to use an axe?
---
Imagine when in my company they told us a group of scrum teams is a tribe and a group of tribes working together is... a horde!!!
---
Same here
---
Shhhhh let all the noobs think they will be melee gods and we end up with 5 million shamans stuck healing us in pvp shhhhhh
---
It takes Joana who had the Vanilla solo leveling record around 4 hours /played to hit level 12. 
---
There isn't anything in Vanilla that tells you where the quests are, this along with most people having absolutely no idea about the most efficient questing route easily makes level 12 take 5+ hours.
---
&gt; It starts to sound like a semantic argument
---
Well, it literally is. Semantics can be important though. 
---
&gt;But people sometimes call you elitist by not allowing them in group, when in reality I don't want to take 3 hours to do what should be done in 1.
---
Yeah, that's why semantics are important :P People don't know what words mean.
---
I think I've raided with you before.
---
Upon catching your pet. You need to feed him every 3 min, but once you reach rank 6 loyalty it's very rarely. A stack of food is much more than enough to keep your pet happy thru a raid. Even if you feed him too often, so you don't lose the bonus damage in the middle of a fight.
---
I'm sure we will find out when we read about some shifty dude getting arrested for stalking children outside some school.
---
I'm a min maxer but I know most pugs won't do anything perfectly so I focus on only what I can control which I'd myself. Plus it's fun to go to old content and smash it.
---
I'm going to play Vanilla WoW for the first time ever when Classic releases. I started in WoD and have been avoiding private servers and videos about Classic because I don't want to spoil the journey for myself. I'm basically a total newbie and I hope I'm not gonna be yelled at for it haha
---
But they can stack the Edgemaster's with the racial for swords, right? And the prevailing theory is either 310 or 315 skill to negate glancing blows. So both together would be just over, or almost enough for glancing blows.
---
Oh....you dont understand what a source is.  Nevermind,I didnt realize what kind of peraon I was dealing with.  Carry on.
---
I'd kill em all.
---
They can’t.  When you hear about all these raids of 40 rank 14 players ripping through content in BiS gear where everyone is flasked and has 15 other consumables stacked, it’s because they’ve been playing private servers for way to long and either have a tainted memory of what vanilla was actually like, or never played vanilla at all.
---
In reality, the only people that were flasked would be the tanks on progression fights and that the one guy that’s really good at playing the auction house.
---
But don’t fret, consumables (other than mana potions) were basically overkill back then.
---
I mean, of course wipes happen. But that doesn't change the fact that the content and mechanics required are vastly simplified compared to even TBC raids.  
---
My main point was that this 'advantage' won't last that long. And even with an advantage, most everyone will get the change to experience all forms of content. So one person having a gear advantage doesn't hurt other people or hinder their ability to experience content.
---
I can deep dive further as to why this advantage really isn't a problem. But that's only if you care to discuss.
---
Toxic players tend to be bad players in my experience. Don't be afraid to tell them to shut the fuck up. Chances are, you're never even going to play with the top players on your server, or maybe in some freak 1 in a million dungeon pug. 
---
Think of it this way: the good players will be 60 when you'll be 20. They'll be raid geared when you begin to start farming your pre bis. If you're playing with someone, you're going through the game at the same pace, so if you're bad, they're probably bad too.
---
Ya, most of my friends are disinterested, with a few mild interests at best. I met a few of my RL buddies via online games. Looks like I’ll be finding a new fun guild and might make a new personal friend or two along the way.
---
6 alts?  I'm planning one max lvl alt and twink.  I dont have time for that many characters.
---
Define "way more" for Mages, Rogues, Druids, etc- lol. 4k is approaching BWL / AQ 20 gear, which was kinda the line I was drawing.
---
It's only 14hours a day of spam pre made queues for 4 months chu mean hard
---
I used to check only here if new blue posts had been spotted but out of eagerness, I bookmarked official forums and check official forums each time I come here and can't satisfy my thirst for news.
---
Of course I never find more info over there but I can't help checking, just in case!
---
The people who spend a significant amount of time here probably lean more heavily toward your neckbeard hardcore audience.
---
Breaking news: Classic pushed back to 2021 in sight of BFA 2
---
Sunken Temple.  Large aoe pulls at a time that players aren’t experienced with CC / waiting for tank agro.  This is still in my top 3 favorite dungeons tho.
---
You know there's no guaruntee you'll ever get BiS...most people will just use the best piece they could get to drop, which very well might be a tier set! Nobody's going to ridicule you for wearing perfectly good epics.
---
Her: "He's probably going to play Alliance"
---
Him: "I told her about bubble jumping for fun but I don't think she's going to switch sides"
---
I'll be going back to alliance, after maining horde since Cata. My first ever character was a gnome rogue in BC... Ironforge gates, old stormwind and deeprun tram all just feel so nostalgic
---
Also great way to switch gears when your main gets stuck in a bottleneck zone, PvP gankfest night, etc. Grind out a few levels of rested XP with a different class to break up the monotony, then back to the main while the alt builds up another few levels of rest.
---
I feel like its uldaman but that's just my opinion.
---
And yet all the alliance morons claim shaman is a good strong class.
---
RFK/RFD is realllllly annoying, layout-wise, which is fitting since it's more of a horde based dungeon, and they have awful cities (layout-wise).
---
Apart from those two, I'd say BFD is pretty annoying as well. Maybe Sunken Temple too? Hard to narrow it to just one.
---
I meant to say BM/MM not BM/SV haha, guess that happens for writting this in class. Fixed it, thanks for pointing it out.
---
I read the title about eight times, but then my ears began to bleed.
---
Help!
---
*cries in Classic*
---
That record is extremely outdated, he has improved his times substantially. 
---
Here is a warrior hitting 11 in just over two hours. 
---
https://youtu.be/RPuBxc_9jgE
---
That being the slowest class to level and hunter being the fastest further proves my point. 
---
Also, there are Addons such as questie which show you precise locations for your quest objectives. As well as other things.
---
I've never seen someone leave after the first wipe. It's usually damned hard to find a group and you have to leg it all the way out there. Gonna take more than just a wipe to make people leave.
---
Or u know, one shot people in elem spec
---
You will always get 40% glancing blows on white melee hits against a lvl 63 boss, what weapon skill does is reduce the damage penalty from those glancing blows, the more weapon skill you get the less of a benefit each skill gives, but the early levels of 305 instead of 300 is insanely good, 305&gt;310 is also a good increase but not as major.
---
And thats without counting in the hit chance benefit of weapon skill. 
---
There are lots of info and hit tables and weapon skill/defense online for anyone to read.
---
A contract 0.0001% of players read is hardly indicative of someone necessarily being toxic, same with being a veteran player.
---
I remember I used to hate Gnomeregan, but like every other and loved Sunken Temple and Zul Farrak
---
expansions in general are bad game design. BC made 1-60, Azeroth and most of the gear completely irrelevant overnight.
---
I would say Shadowfang Keep. Those spirit wolves and asspulling extra mobs at the stairs with pets and the boss before last boss can be a nightdmare.
---
People can attempt to do that. I'm sure Blizzard will not only be more aware but much more on top of these instances. I'm not at all knowledgable about how they would go about catching someone or how someone might be able to hide from a system. But I think people are over worrying about this specific aspect of ranking.  
---
Premade groups will run the scene, of this I have no doubt. Those groups can probably spend 3-4 hours a night, maybe 6-8+ or vastly more, if it's a really populated server with multiple teams, crushing WSG/AB and set the honor cap high enough that they won't have to even worry about pugs being able to catch up.
---
So the time investment will vary drastically on many circumstances.
---
Hoping for a follow up of this.
---
my first ever char was a hunter in vanilla..i was new to wow and damn my pet used to cause mayhem every now and again whole raid pulls lol
---
I'm just happy we're getting *weekly* updates. It feels very good.
---
Oh so you're one of those people that think because you cited wowwiki it is 100% accurate information, lol ok buddy. 
---
How do you think pserver devs reverse engineer vanilla? They have to rely on shitty wowhead comments and blog posts form 2004 as sources because that is literally the only information they have available. The entire point is that my linked "source" is just as shitty as all the other "sources" used by pservers.
---
You get honor from killing levels 48-60 as a level 60.
---
Hopefully you can see how this mindset shuts down useful conversation though. You feel so confident that the honor system without bgs will create unbearable ganking while doing little to increase world PvP - all this despite never actually playing a pserver that used the honor system without a bg.
---
Yes the most efficient way to grind honor during this period will be mindlessly camping flight paths, yes it will be more miserable for people trying to level during this time period - many might leave for a PvE server or retail, or leave entirely.
---
But the population of Classic (total volume and composition) will mitigate the severity of the inconvenience. Even if it won't this is the system that existed in Vanilla, trying to engineer a more pleasant experience isn't much different from advocating for class rebalancing.
---
And though I don't think every fight will be TM vs SS I do think this system will increase the amount of world PvP. Some people just want to fight and arent totally consumed by ranking. This system creates conflict, it creates community by incentivizing people to fight against the campers, or at the very least etches the names of those enemies in their minds.
---
I think the real reason top private server PvPers are mostly against this system is that they want to be among the first R14s. They think that this method of ranking is even duller than rolling pugs in their pre-mades, and that the best PvPers will have less of a competitive advantage (any idiot can camp a flight path right, while it takes some skill to form and execute a premade).
---
Feels like transmog with extra steps
---
Great compilation of info to get someone started with speed levelling. 
---
Ive been working on a Paladin route and the hardest part has been the places where you have to grind for a while to get that last 1/4 or 1/3 of a level. 
---
Do you have any specific kill times or kills/hr that you shoot for? Right now the strategy of Sealing and praying for crits is the fastest but the RNG is just dreadful and I'm positive much slower than my hunters and warlocks usually are at this level.
---
Looking to main Hunter. Haven't been able to find a super in depth guide to pets. Advantages and disadvantages of each type of pet for leveling? Why? Same goes for end game. What do you spend your pet points on? Stamina? Armor? Why? Bite vs claw? Why not both? Are there certain pets that are good at certain level ranges? Is it possible to respec a pet? Which abilities for pets are the best, and why? 
---
I've found rizayas YouTube helpful and kargoz helpful but not anything super in depth and comprehensive. Help?
---
I don't have much private server experience, having only rolled on one for the first time a couple months ago as I started to tweek out over the wait for Classic. However, I was very, very surprised by how cool and welcoming the community was. A few level 60s were handing out gold and wands at Razor Hill, tons of questions were being answered in general chat, and I was invited to a group for probably about 90% of the elite/named quests that had people waiting on spawns when I arrived.
---
Dungeons were also legitimate group efforts. During my first SM Cath run, we had a Hunter who hadn't played any WoW since Vanilla and was doing literally everything wrong - pet pulling, pet on taunt, etc. The tank politely gave him some pointers and instead of shrieking at eachother they spent the next two runs shooting the shit and chatting about the NBA.
---
There are of course going to be the requisite group of dick holes on each server, but a lot of my fears re: the community have been totally and completely put to rest. It doesn't hurt either that there are so many old grandpas running around that just want to chill and have a good time, and won't be flipping out if it takes a bit longer to down a raid boss than it should. We're in for a good time!
---
In the blood of lesser beings
---
People on private realms seem to be very forgiving and supporting, but don't expect them do accept every shit you do.
---
Even if most are now in their mid 20/30's, time is still valuable. Even more so I'd argue. If the group wipes for the fourth time because you still can't understand that threat is a thing in classic, then be prepared to be dropped. 
---
Prime candidates are people who pull for the tank, despite being told not to numerous times. 
---
I wish someone would write up a general Classic Wow-Etiquette, concerning things like loot (rolling for chests, when to need/greed) and general behavior.
---
Right, and from what I've read, it's 30%, and that each point of weapon skill is 3% less. It's not as direct as that, those numbers are basically a 'more or less' version of it.
---
Overpower is only really good if you are low on rage, with wbuffs spamming heroic strike is higher dps then swapping to bstance losing rage to overpower. It can be used ofc, but it's so little.
---
If you check top parsers on legacyplayers you can see that they barely use it.
---
Crappy solutions for irrelevant issues. I just want to pew pew. Don't care for appearance myself.
---
Just keeping the group from getting lost in the hallways is going to be fun. That and realizing far too late that you didn't clear all the dragonkin before pulling Eranikus.
---
It's a great class to 1-59, very fun journey. That's going to be majority of players in classic and I bet they're gonna have a blast with shaman.
---
also if you left bear form while tanking a boss you would die instantly lol
---
Oh...you're still here?
---
"accident" hahah. ha
---
Well we're all going to be in a PVP-RP server....and no where near your server.  So you can tell us :D
---
16.8 raids of 40 people flasking only once for the week.
---
I'm pretty new to classic/vanilla (started in TBC), so I've been deep diving as best I can in preparation.  My favorite resource is probably Kargoz on youtube.  He did some excellent classic leveling guides, and while is videos are long, he compiles everything into a powerpoint presentation and puts it in a google drive.  Easily digestible, and very informative.  I'd actually link you his video and the drive link directly, but I'm on mobile atm.
---
cool story
---
&gt; Death / Travel:
---
At lower levels a lot of the time it is literally faster to intentionally die and take the spirit rez to hand in quests than it is to walk back to town. Plus your gear gets replaced so fast and repair costs are so cheap it doesn't matter.
---
And the hakkar summoning ritual is one or the coolest bosses in Vanilla.
---
There actually was a private server that had something very similar. They did have BGs early on, but they were few and far between so rankers sat out in the world farming for a majority of the time. The result? The server pop dwindled from 5k peaks to 2-3k peaks within a month. I don't want to see a repeat of that.
---
The vanilla honor system only existed for 50 days or so in Vanilla before BGs were introduced (WSG &amp; AV) it wasn't some huge length of time. Phase 1 will already be full of World PvP. 
---
I disagree with your last point as the top pvpers will push as hard as they need to, 5-7 days a week to make their bracket 1 honor. More skilled players win more skirmishes, have less deaths = more honor per hour than others.
---
You sure that's how it was in Vanilla? I'm pretty sure that's a private server thing - I don't think honor was meant to be given on anybody that's gray level
---
What's the better solution? You can't make everything relevant forever and without moving forward WoW would reach the success it had.
---
Yes, absolutely! Thank you!
---
Gnomer is a pain, lots of mobs, lots of close corridors you may agro more mobs in. Long and confusing place.  After that brd just for the huge amount of time you have to commit to doing it.
---
Hunter is fuckawful between 7 and you getting your pet at 10 but after that it turns into faceroll mode.
---
I feel the same, I've placed top 10 multiple times as a holy/ret paladin through my years of doing 2v2/3v3/5v5 arenas. I like to think I have a better understanding and natural ability to process this game than the average person. 
---
Yet I love running with random groups of people who WANT to get better and listen to constructive criticism.
---
Non-human warriors exist. Also, everything is a hunter weapon. As for the AQ40 question, that turn-in also give a really good shield so they usually go to the tanks.
---
Yep, that's correct. The problem then becomes you're passing up on good gear like Flameguard or Gaunts of Annihilation. Particularly with Annnilhilation you're better off taking the stats over the wep skill, and by that point in progression you might be able to get your hands on one of the few other sources of +wep skill like Maladith or Anubisath Warhammer.
---
I've had mine all figured out for so long now - i just need to get in!!
---
Orc Warrior (Tank @60) - leveling skinning/mining, @60 going Alchemy/Engineering

This and making sure you get your names locked in for all your toons also.
---
Happens to me all the time.   
---
Sitting watching TV with my wife.   
---
Suddenly I get a thought in my head "I wonder when theyre going to release a date soon"  
---
My eyes glaze over and my mind wanders about all the fun times ahead. 
---
My wife, "Babe, what the fuck is wrong?"
---
Me, "Just thinking about my video games"
---
My Wife, "Whatever"
---
You know people who roll sham to dps aren't gonna switch to healing. This isn't actual vanilla where people will conform.
---
Where did Alenyagamer mention that the OP mentioned dynamic respawns?
---
Personally I want to help new players out. I love this game and hope folks that haven't played before will come to love it too.
---
Honestly, don't worry about the jerks. There's a reason r/gatekeeping is a thing.
---
It's just like the one shadow priest pet everyone brings to pump the warlocks full of shadow steroids
---
I've dived into pretty much every MMO out there. For me they've all become too streamlined (retail WoW included). 
---
While FF XIV and ESO each offer some challenges and breathtaking scenery, like you said, it's all within a box. It's just connecting the dots, you reach X level, so you need Y piece of gear, so que up for Z dungeon. 
---
When new content is added they let you teleport to the new box, experience the content, and then be done with it. It gets bland.
---
I feel like Vanilla WoW really nailed the balance between challenging (and forcing players to communicate to overcome challenges), and accessibility. That's how good memories are made.
---
Don't forget the ghosts that fly over and kill the healer. And pulling the last boss sometimes yields a bit of a surprise if you forgot something. Can't wait to see that place again soon.
---
I mean it's definitely more fun than paladin so I could see why some people view it as better.
---
But they are still area of effect buffs for party members, right?
---
Just git gud, video games aren't hard, there is no good reason to suck at them unless you have a disability.
---
I’ve watched his warrior one. I like written guides more than videos. I’ll still watch it!
---
1 - T2 Priest,
---
2 - T3 Mage,
---
3 - T3 Shaman,
---
4 - T2 Warlock,
---
5 - T2 Warrior or Druid
---
I definitely like T3 but since I did plenty of Naxx in WotLK and they recolored the same gear it seems more familiar to me.
---

It probably stems from ret paladins being less usable in raids. Reputation turns into a meme, meme exaggerates things, alters reality of things. In reality they're fine for dungeons and I had a lot of fun in PvP. just for the love of god invest in engineering so you don't get kited
---
Just don;'t put up with it yourself and look for people like you. I have never played on a private server, and haven't raided in close to 10 years. I will be coming back for classic though. I imagine a lot of rusty old vets who are more casual now will do the same. I'm hoping we can all band together and create an atmosphere of not taking this shit too seriously.
---
If someone doesn't warn the group it's their fault if they drag the group down. Vice versa if you say you are new and they invite you, they won't get mad at you ever basically because they know you are new.
---
Not telling a group will almost garuantee rage or toxicity
---
I played Ret and Holy back in BC and it's very similar to Vanilla Pally. Pally really only changed in the past several expansions but back in BC it was pretty much the same class as Vanilla.
---
Hi, /u/Flippy_Bobcat
---
donno. I dont get paid enough to come up with good ideas.
---
[https://youtu.be/YJhX8amTi5E](https://youtu.be/YJhX8amTi5E?list=WL)
---
The first spot that came to mind is a section of Uldaman with the larger Troggs. The melee ones hit like a truck when they enrage and they also mix casters in the pulls. The groups are pretty tightly packed and it's more difficult to spot patrols in the narrow corridors. Another spot is in Mara just past the toxic elemental boss, there's a hallway with patrolling centaur spear throwers. If you don't spot them quick they can easily wipe the group if you're already fighting another pack. Not to mention they constantly root you with nets and run to spam spears. Both of these spots are a non issue if you know the patrol paths, but I've definitely been in groups where it caught the tank off guard and wiped us.
---
I'm sure there is, which is why people aren't sure if it's 310 or 315 to max it, and also why I said it's 'more or less' that, not exactly.
---
Shadowfang Keep is probably the *actual* hardest place for a group of five strangers to finish. One person who doesn't listen can *so easily* get the entire group killed by running ahead of the tank and pulling three groups. The entire dungeon is so densely packed. The very first boss, Rethilgore, is literally a pull of 4 elites at the same time, where Rethilgore is constantly Immobilizing the tank. It's a very basic fight mechanic, but since you're only around level 22, you have to use your very few skills in your kit to stay alive.
---
Then the rest of the dungeon has curses, patrols (some that spawn behind you), spell immunities, mirror image puppies that destroy your tank... and to top it off, theres a couple trash pulls in there that have 4 or 5 elites, with ALL of these mechanics in play.
---
So you carve your way through the winding castle, and have probably already died a couple times. Then you just have the last two bosses to kill, except theyre actually stupid hard. Wolf Master Nandos won't engage you until you attack him or kill his wolves, but you have to kill 3 elites and a non-elite. You have to CC and save your mana/cooldowns though, because Wolf Master Nandos keeps summoning MORE elites when you fight him. 
---
And Arugal is self explanatory. Hes probably the most mechanically "complex" fight in all of 1-60. He only really shadowbolts, wreaking havoc on the tank, teleports around to 3 spots just to be a dick. And lastly, it has the first of the few Mind Control mechanics in the entire game. Healer gets turned into an angry puppy? Well, better start frantically scanning your bags for a shitty health potion. Tank gets mind controlled? Better learn to line-of-sight before you get 2 shot by those 300 dmg chunky shadow bolts.
---
SFK really lets each class feel *useful*. Hibernate, sheep, arcane explosion, decurses, stuns, shackles, fears, and pretty much every survival tool at your disposal will be used at one point here. It's probably the worst and best place for a newbie to visit.
---
Remember the open dungeons in WoW, many people often cleared those than Instances.
---
I remember Durn the 100-foot giant, aggressive angry flocks of birds by the road, Warsong patrollers taking over like all the roads to the east, and the Kurenai being unfriendly to me.
---
Nagrand looked nice but everything was out to kill you.
---
Oh, my poor wife. She still doesn't know why I am up in the clouds these days
---
Ele/Resto is fun in PvP. Resto is actually a good time in raids and most gear can be used if you wanna respec.
---
"Did somebody hear a whelp noise in the distance? No, just me? Huh..."
---
Eh, 40g for a full bag of ammo isn't that bad considering the inflation in BC.
---
Form your own groups and you’ll be fine lol.
---
Some people will be dicks.  Don’t be a dick.
---
2h tanking isn't actually that terrible to deal with during leveling (and also higher gear levels).
---
They could add higher res textures but it should be patched later because everyone wants Classic ASAP. Would take more work and delaying release date. We just need everything in working condition :)
---
I hope they don't announce it 2 days before the release. I am not prepared yet
---
Just play an Alliance Pally. I typically play Blood Elves on Horde and have for most of my time playing WoW. But without Blood Elves which I love, I'm going Alliance. I also love Holy Pally and that will be my alt, so again, going Alliance. I suggest you do the same and you'll not only enjoy your favorite class, but you'll have a bunch of new to you content to play through with the Alliance zones if you haven't done much of them yet.
---
I don't think it's necessarily lazy. I think they noticed that the time investment was so vast. That the rewards should be relevant across nearly all aspects of the game.
---
You could say have 2 players come Naxx.
---
Player A: 35 days played, near full BiS dps gear. Full BiS tank gear.
---
Player B: 65 days played, some Naxx pieces and full Rank 14 gear.
---
If they waited to upgrade that gear until Naxx came out or was close to coming out. There would be relatively little incentive to grinding as much as one would need to in order to hit r14. That's also considering the fact that by that time, there will most certainly be less premades going on and far more pugging, requiring potentially more time investment to get gear that Naxx guilds already out pace.
---
R14 gear essentially stays on top (weapon wise at least) until AQ 40. Once that hit's Dark Edge becomes the best 2hander until Naxx. The one hander melee weapons will stay BiS until Naxx. The armor on the other hand can be replaced in certain slots by crafted blues/epics. And pieces out of MC/BWL when PvE is concerned.
---
To have put as much time into the game as it takes to get R12-14, I totally think it's fair that this gear would be able to outpace other pieces for several raid instances. And even then, people will be using other items that are better than the R12/13 armor. The only items that really last until deep AQ/Naxx are the R14 weapons. (Outside of hunter gloves).
---
Yeah...coming from EQ 1999-2001 when i started WoW i had to fight my elitist tendancies to laugh in their faces when they said WoW was hard.
---
"i had to run back to my corpse and it took like 10 minutes!!"
---
"great....come back when you have to do that as a naked character not a ghost and oh by the way you've lost 5 hours of progress on your experience bar"
---
I suspect most will go for gathering for a little extra coin, and for a rare time low level ores, herbs leathers will be going dirt cheap  Hell even if you have silver/gold ore to level mining (only gather I really remember sells well) you won't get much for it early server game.  I dunno what to do....aim for foods buffs for healers and tanks for early instance, probably waste of time.  As someone said earlier...probably best to press hard for lvl 60 and AOE or whatever
---
I was debating mentioning ST with the 60 dungeons, but I figure most of the time it's all just people in their 50's running it. And goddamn is it hard. I've had lots of fun using weird strategies to take down that dungeons trash. Using warlocks bouncing fears around to keep 2 elites distracted while we pummel 1 elite. Using a mage to frost nova the entire group and kite while we deal with them slowly rather than AOEing and eating too much damage.
---
&gt;That being the slowest class to level and hunter being the fastest further proves my point.
---
For 90 % of the playerbase who don't know how to kite / double hit hunter isn't the fastest class 1-10. If anything for the casual player hunter is garbage 1-10.
---
&gt;Here is a warrior hitting 11 in just over two hours.
---
So a speed runner who hits level 11 (not 12) in over 2 hours proves your point that people 
---
&gt;Should be 12 or so within 3 hours max
---
If anything this shows that you are wrong, and that 95 % of everyone won't be 12 be 3 hours max.
---
That's not how gray levels work. A level 47 will be gray to a level 60. A level 48 will be green.
---
[Here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Mob_difficulty_colors?oldid=383978)'s a link to a graph from Vanilla. Level 55s and lower would be gray to *level 70s*, not level 60s. Note that this isn't the most recent version of the page as the formulay for gray levels has changed since then in retail.
---
too bad you'll be getting their updated models
---
It's kind of absurd how high lvl Archaedas is. Hes 47 and the rest of the dungeon is gray by the time you reach that level, so you end up with a group of 5 people fighting a giant red boss AND his annoying adds. That fight, Grimlok, and the firehammer guy always give me alot of pain.
---
Resolution so high that my computer is still loading the image as I write this comment. cool +1
---
I've always wished the in-game map was replaced with this type of map. Is there an addon that does this?
---
I had a random dungeon member give me 40 gold so I could buy a mount. That was cool.
---
I agree to an extent, and the example I gave was really situational and I can only give my side of the story.  Usually in vanilla days when we had a lot of stupid wipes we didn't blame any one person, usually we decided to call the raid.  In pservers it was exactly how some people explained, hardcore people pushing hardcore content.  I can tell you i'll be looking for a guild somewhere in the middle, but closer to the more forgiving side of things.  We always said "RL comes first" in vanilla.
---
I must be type G: I dont care so much about my quite average dps, I know I'm doomed to stay far from mages / rogues / fury wars / warlocks, but for some of them my aura will help their performance a little bit healers / tanks will thank me for my quick tranq shot, my group will be happy with aspect of the pack whenever we need to run for a while. 
---
AND most important thing: I will quite reliably trap anything I can in group content, preparing traps in advance, using feign death as soon as the CDs are up and prepare next trap (between current trap and healer position as it will likely be next target after fd) as soon as the first one triggers etc. More difficult / less reliable than other classes CCs but I always enjoyed this preparation stuff.
---
I'll also have a lot of fun using my pet to attract packs of monsters out of my way and run past through them unharmed, just to feign death later after they stop running after my pet
---
And a lot of other fun things, Classic is not only about raids!
---
I actually LOVE doing RFK/RFD. That level 28-38 bracket goes so quickly for me because of those two. The entire feel of the dungeon is so unique. Although you will wipe a bit there, and the runback is not pretty...
---
Ret is a middle of the pack dps if played properly and with a few consumes. Really not as bad as y’all pretend it is.
---
remember when the frost shock lasted longer than the cool down?   That was fun indefinitely putting someone under it and you could just nuke them from afar
---
Not at all. I was a kid and mostly had shit stuff for most of a vanilla and consequently looked like shit. It was exciting seeing someone in bg or sitting in town with identifiably good gear. I played a bit again during MOP and it was dumb everyone looked like they were straight out of final fantasy or something, every piece of their gear matched perfectly, and it was impossible to tell someone’s strength by their looks.
---
You're dead wrong. Anyone who ganks lowbies is a dumbass. World pvp is about resource control. Some dude's farming a spot? Kill him and take it from him. Someone mining a node? Kill him and take it from him. 
---
Just like in real life, war is about resources. 
---
People ahead of the zerg rarely, if ever, engage in wpvp while leveling. Why? Because resources (in that case, exp) is virtually infinite. When they start competing at 60 for the good farming spots, that's when they'll fight. Because those resources are finite, and worth fighting over.
---
I completely forgot about those ghosts. Going to be rough for the people who never played Vanilla and (justifiably) think it's something they need to run over and nuke down.
---
The server that launched last year had minimal BG queues popping and you were able to queue from anywhere in the world. The result? Death squads roaming around, hard camping anyone they could find to grind honor. The result of that? 5k population peaks dwindling to 2-3k in a couple of months time.
---
We use them to chop wood.
---
*laughs in free action potion*
---
The one cool thing about Gnomer is that it lets that one person who knows the place kind of act as a guide. There are so many wrong directions or shortcuts that make at least *someone* who knows the way a necessity.
---
For me it's Uldaman, large pulls, some inconvient pats in the middle of the dungeon, and the last boss is always a bit of a scramble if you aren't glitching it (I don't like to glitch fights). Pair that with the fact that everyone thinks you can do this dungeon at 38, which is ill advised, and you have a very hard dungeon.
---
Any a little nervous if we pressured the question to much. We force  release date and may not be rdy by then?
---
haha. i know that line :D
---
Yes, they stack. Multiple rejuvs or renews however does not.
---
no conocia de las comunidades que hablaran español en retail de esos tiempos y termine jugando en proudmoore antes que salieran los realms latinos, que shame, crees que la comunidad latina se organice y veamos guild latinas en classic?
---
Uh...erm...they will if they want to raid. People don't really change like that.
---
I don’t give a fuuuuuuuh. I lived for 2h Windfury. And Blizz took it away. I shall reclaim what is mine.
---
I honestly keep coming back to flying mounts destroying your attachment to the game. I think you have soo much attachment to the vanilla zones because you traversed them by foot and mount for YEARS. You know every corner of every zone.  
---
When flying came out, you just flew over everything and had no further attachment to the zone.
---
&gt; We get normalized nerfed pets with poor scaling.
---
Please tell me this is true. Please tell me i don't need to spend days hunting for that fucking cat or a wolf that everyone is going for.
---
It's literally such a turn off that i'm thinking about rolling another class. But if all pets are pretty much the same, i'm a happy hunter !
---
Those troggs may as well be their own boss. I recently ran it as a bear tank, and they were doing 20% of my HP per swing. I can't imagine how quickly they'd kill the healer.
---
My experience with private servers is that most people are old farts, myself included. It’ll be refreshing having some new blood that we can help find Mankrik’s wife.
---
That is a good point, I never played an ally toon pre cata so all of their zones will be new to me.
---
Rejuv stacking with renew works if I remember correctly. However, rejuv stacking with other druids does not work in vanilla. That was added in tbc.
---
So how it works in vanilla:
---
Druid A puts rejuv that heals for 302
---
Druid B puts rejuv that heals for 230.
---
Druid B puts rejuv on first. Druid A removes druid B's buff and applies his. Druid B gets an error message when trying to reapply his rejuv, stating that a stronger buff is on the target.
---
That gave me a chuckle!
---
How dare you, they are *not* centaurs. They are beautiful dryad maiden! &gt;:(
---
home, its beautifull
---
Arent there Target Dummies already set up in Theramore for Alliance?
---
I know there's NPCs there attacking them, but I recall them being target-able and attackable by players as well.
---
Paladin says hello, RECKBOMB ARAFUHASGAAHHH *Huge crater where the Shaman was trying to kite the paladin*
---
You can use FD as a sort of interrupt when a lock is casting shadow bolt or fear though.
---
Uh, what? T3 was generally slightly better than level 70 dungeon blues, especially taking into account set bonuses, it was much better than any random green shit. Several Naxx weapons were BIS until heroic dungeon loot or the arena weapons.
---
Ha there won't even be bgs for months...
---
Others may tell you to roll on a private server, I strongly recommend you don’t.
---
I wish I could experience Wow for the first time again, don’t spoil yourself.
---
If you really want to, YouTube a class discussion video and figure out what play style you want to roll with. Don’t worry about falling behind, it’s an easy game to pick up and you’ll have it figured out in no time.
---
This was how I dealt with campers back in the day
---
Blacksmithing FTW
---
Bronze shoulders, IIRC.
---
Im curious, what glitch exactly? One thing I'm hoping for with Classic is the death of all these really lame glitches that trivialize the fight. Wyrmthalak in LBRS is one of the worst ones, where you just send a pet to him near the ogre section and he runs through the walls to you.
---
think so to. last boss with aggro switches can be hard to manage depending on group
---
Don't underestimate spirit stat tho - reduced downtimes while leveling by a lot actually.
---
Evil Eye! That's a guild name that brings back nostalgia.
---
I played Bloodscalp-EU too, in the guild &lt;Harveys Heroes&gt;!
---
lol, I bought those books in good condition paperback for $1 each, seems like more people couldn't finish it.  I think I made it to the 3rd book but that was a long time ago before youtube took over and we forgot how to read books. 
---
I still buy books, but I have to admit I read less than I buy.  Maybe it;s time to ban all electronic devices from the bedroom.
---
A full Gnomeregan run isn't hard per se, however it isn't easy to keep the whole group motivated to clean up in one giant run as alliance. You have  a whooping 8 dungeon quests in there and you have to exit and reenter the dungeon for one. 
---
Making people not jump off onto the cogwheel but actually follow the designated path for the goblin escort quest, the punch cards etc. is a major pain in the ass.
---
A full Gnomeregan run is probably longer than LBRS run.
---
I loved this instance!  It was hard to find a good mix, but I always found that having a good hunter(one that dismissed their pet) and a druid was always the way to go.
---
Huh? RFD is amazing.
---
I was there 3000 years ago, the 3rd war of the Shamans vs the Paladins. Dont you start it up again, the war ended 14 years ago.
---
Murloc in wc is very tough for most groups,sfk as a whole, and st as a whole
---
LOL the best was watching my friend's guild run MC and friend hoping so much for judgement legs........they got all shaman gear.
---
How is it "authentic" to walk in perpetual fog? I don't get this. View distance is the one thing that bothers me the most in vanilla, actually. Not being able to see shit past 100yd is just annoying. Not even talking about mob/player draw distance, which would affect the game, but just environment draw distance. Why can't I see BRM from Thorium Point?
---
Yea if you do all the quests in the starting zones and grind on the way to quests you can hit 12, most people just get 10 and go to the next zone though instead of doing like gol Bolar quarry and mangeclaw
---
well said!
---
Im happy around 310 usually
---
[Get a Fucking Owl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nostalrius/comments/4645yc/psa_for_hunters_pet_decision_aka_get_a_fucking_owl/)
---
I totally forgot about this dungeon. I literally cannot remember a single thing about except I know I’ve done it because I had the Diamond Flask. 
---
This makes me look forward to Vanilla all over again.
---
That boss fight is brutal. Pray tell what exactly is the glitch?
---
When I said hunters are the fastest class to level I was talking about 60. Yes prior to 10 there leveling is much less advantageous. 
---
Also, I said 12 or so not specifically 12. So to avoid speaking in absolutes. 
---
Here is a video of him doing it as orc, he also takes time to level professions and do the class quest. Takes him 3 hours. I am not wrong. 
---

---
You ignore my points about joanas guide being outdated as well as in game Addons to assist with questing completely as well. 
---
Arguing for the sake of arguing isn’t fun.
---
Lol same, this week I had a dream they announced a may 18th release
---
Second YouTube class discussions, or the weekly Classy Friday posts on here. There's also been a few posts in the LFG threads of guilds aimed at helping noobies learn the ropes, and I imagine those will be relatively common once the game launches.
---
You swap out edgemasters for annihilation yeah, at that gear level, especially with world buffs you replace most mainhand swings with heroic strike anyway wich means only the offhand will glance, you will however not replace edgies with flameguard.
---
Ive seen the comment about Druids being weak healers and I disagree with that. They are inferior to Priests, but everyone is. As a Paladin healing MC and on in Classic, I was always jealous of druids. Classic healing amounted to whack-a-mole to see who could top people off first. You couldnt outheal the priest. But the HoTs that druids have help to stabilize tank health, and the utility of Mark of Wild and BRez are big-time. Also, competition for Raid gear is pretty slim. Our raid Druids were usually well geared before the other classes.
---
The only Naxx equivalent loot from R14 are the 1 handed (Swords/Maces/Axes). Everything else can be replaced in AQ 40. And there are even weapons that are pretty close in BWL and even 1 or 2 from MC.
---
The armor itself, outside of a few specific pieces here and there, will generally not be used because of crafted blues/epics and early MC/BWL/ZG items that are frankly more geared towards PvE. (Hit % being the major stat).
---
I said in an earlier comment, if they made the system rating based. Sure, make the gear equal to raid tier. But because it's an insane time investment and because raid gear frankly catches up quick in PvE circumstances. Quicker then most people actually understand, it's fair to give these few players 1.12 stated armor/weapons.
---
The reason being, as the server ages and more content is released, the benefit of grinding to R12-14 continues to decrease. If they mirrored the stats to the release cycle, it would have next to no benefit. The only thing it would really do, is guarantee that you get gear. And I don't think that guarantee outweighs the daily time investment involved in hitting those ranks.
---
With MC out, BRE isn't really that far off R14 2h's. Especially with the buff up. BWL release, Ashkandi is also relatively close. AQ Dark Edge is better.
---
If that stat change was implemented, people may still try and get to 14 around Naxx. But the premades and relative participation at that time will be significantly down. So it becomes more of a solo and drastically more time intensive than being able to jump in with the premades. Yeah people that did the grind earlier would have the items when the buffs hit, but they might even have gear from raids that are better.
---
Naxx gear is just outright better. Most of 2.5 is so relatively close that it would be a waste of time to hit R14, unless you just wanted the prestige of it. Which at that point, REALLLLYYYY????
---
I've been playing a pserver lately to get a feel for the classes after leaving WoW 8+ years ago. I don't have a problem with new players, or inexperience, but the real problem is when you are playing in a dungeon with new players who refuse to communicate. A simple "Hey guys, this is my first time playing this dungeon, so bear with me and feel free to give me advice during the run" would be great. I did a Deadmines run the other day, and 3 of the 4 other players didn't talk almost at all the entire time (they said enough to show they spoke English). That would be fine if they're doing their job, but we had non-tank folks blindly running into new areas and aggroing 2-3x the safe mob amount. This led to a few totally unnecessary wipes. Not only that, but people straight up just refuse to listen. On the last few platforms up to the ship you can accidentally aggro the patrol on the top deck, which is an insta-wipe, if you are standing on the ramp in a certain area. After wiping on this part, I told everyone very clearly that we needed to stand all the way back on the platform and let the tank pull the top area between patrols. Sure enough, both of our paladins followed the tank up, fought the mobs on the ramp, and wiped us again. Then people quit the group 5-6 mobs before VC because we kept wiping. 
---
So basically, be open and honest about your noob-ness because that's the only way to fight it.
---
That would be on my birthday!! The perfect 30th birthday present!!
---
Great post. Hittin me hard with that nostalgia. Can’t wait to rediscover this game and find portions I never explored as a kid!!
---
The warrior set is pretty good, idk if what they are saying is true, but I know the set isn't terrible
---
Maies Ouie
---
Wonderful.  So many memories.
---
I’ll one hit him into the ground with WF.
---
Or be a filthy casual, have one toon, and have that rested all the way to 60
---
I have yet to see this kind of attitude on any private server. On the recent fresh server I played I didn't encounter a single player leaving in the middle of a dungeon from RFC to BRD. 
---
The "leave after the first wipe" attitude is very much a retail thing, where you're an anonymous player whose behaviour have no consequences and can just queue up again. If you pull that shit in Classic you'll quickly be in the blacklist of most players and never find a group again.
---
Druid sets are beautifil
---
I can understand that.  I still want to make a vanilla server with flying, not to play on , but to explore the world from above, all those spots that were just out of reach in real vanilla.  
---
I think this is possible by giving yourself admin powers on an empty private server, but I haven't tried it out yet.
---
&gt; Is the current state of WOW anything like classic to where I can maybe just poke around to understand some basic stuff? 
---
nah, not even the trial do lvl20. totally, totally different.
---
Only way to practice is to go to a pserver but I would recommend to just wait for the real launch and suck it all up, it really is one hell of a journey.
---
I would say get friends to play with you but... you will definitely get friends along the way. Just be aware that the game does not hand held, at nothing. You might fill lost sometimes, make us of that friends list. An MMORPG to its fullest.
---
Peoplw think they need all the bis shit, all the buff. Perfect rotations. People just get stuff and deal with it. First naxx kill had druids in it.
---
Quests don’t show up on your minimap, so yes it’s very common to miss quests. In fact, mission boards and wanted posters don’t even have an exclamation mark over them! It rewards being aware and investigative much more than retail.
---
This is why TBC was amazing.  People besides mages, warlocks, warriors, and rogues got to feel like they had options and could contribute as something other than a heal/totem bot.
---
That’s partially due to the map being majorly confusing to navigate and largely due to the fact that if you switched zones, you loaded into a new one, which broke the continuity of feeling like an open world game.
---
We all were noobs so we thought brd is leveling dungeon. We were all 51-56 and we had no clue where to go or what to do. It took us nearly 6 hours to "complete" the dungeon (I think we missed some bosses) and we had to leave the instance to repair so many times... was really awesome and fun and the excitement when we were done was indescribable.
---
TBH though, as a "real" leveling dungeon, WC was the hardest due to getting lost all the time and failing the jump over the one ledge too many times
---
PvPing is generally a loss of Gold (if you use consumes etc) and there is no way around it.
---
Maybe farming mobs in Alterac Valley or doing World PvP and farming herbs/veins at the same time is what comes to my mind.
---
You can try to "sell" your PvP contribution (like a Druid carrying flags during Warsong weekend) but to except people paying you, you probably need the gear/skill for it
---
He is a good boy.
---
Google will help. 
---
As for earning gold, pvp or pve doesn’t make too much of a difference, but you have to put some effort in.
---
You could also use the auction house to buy and sell if you know what can be profitable, without leaving the major cities.
---
Or, just don't "strategise". Just play the game, enjoy the exploration and find a like minded guild.
---
If you really enjoy planning ahead, then do it of course. But don't just give in to the pressure to "know this, know that, prepare! prepare! prepare!". :P
---
I got to agree that ST is probably the hardest and also my favorite vanilla dungeon. 
---
But Zul’Farak can be a son of a bitch. The fight on the steps, the fucking boss that freezes people in stone, and like ST it has to be done in the correct order. Very easy to pull too many mobs. Tons of places with mobs packed so tight with multiple pats moving around. 
---
ZF and ST for sure the hardest. And yet I love both.
---
Honor is also a resource in WoW, one that can only be earned by attacking and defeating the opposite faction. The best way to earn honor in phase 2 of the release will be doing their best to efficiently earn it by causing world PvP incidences, (raiding cities, killing traveling players, etc.). 
---
Fun is also a resource, as limitless as EXP but much harder to quantify. Just because you do not enjoy instigating situations doesn't mean that no one should be able to.
---
Also, what if the resource one wants is being farmed by a lowbie? Should they kill them? Are they a "dumb ass" if they do?
---
Never really had problems running thru em pre60 and I think every class have a way to kite the bears :p
---
They go to whoever wants to buy or already has edgemasters
---
30 and mellow as hell
---
Take loans out from your PVE friends. 
---
Farm grey shit in Ashenvale/Arathi while waiting for BG queues to pop. 
---
You’ll be broke if you don’t farm gold or get lucky with drops.
---
It was more meant as humor than an actual complaint.
---
Yeah, you can almost look at Uldaman as 2 dungeons because of the level difference between the entrance and Archaedas.
---
Yes, but when there are "like 30" people around with dynamic respawns mobs spawn almost instantly, that won't be the case in Classic.
---
Right? I especially love Dreamwalker for the super "Emerald Dream" vibe it gives off.  
---
But I've also loved the color green since I was like...4 so I'm kinda biased :P
---
As a druid, I did mind lol. Shaman might have, too, but no one else did.
---
If you mean healer exclusively Druids are pretty good from my experience on a private server for a while. Moonkin is fun but a complete mana dumpster fire and as much as I love being a moonkin they just aren't terribly raid viable compared to other classes even using your own innervate on top of potions. Feral cat druids however using a god tier rotation actually can be fairly awesome at DPS and actually compete when properly played. I can't recall the main druid healers rotation anymore but in Classic the secret to healing was always down ranking heal spells and stacking a ton of +healing to make smaller heals significantly more mana efficient while remaining potenct on heals. I wonder i I can dig up logs, he was a very good healer and the class lead for our guild.
---
I'm not sure how the process will work now, but one of the rampant issues we had back in the day was people account sharing and colluding. 
---
The rank 14 grind is one of the biggest time sinks in wow. Not only is a large amount of time required, but it requires you not to take breaks or you'll lose progress compared to other players at rank 13, who are competing for rank 14. 
---
If you were friendly with other rank 13 players on your server, you could collude and account share. So one way to manipulate the system is to not grind as much as the other rank 13 player so he gets rank 14 and then they swap. Or you can just account share and have that character engaged in PvP 24/7. 
---
I really hope blizzard is more strict on account sharing than they used to be.
---
To be a WoW virgin, honestly I envy you. Hold on to it until release! 
---
You’ll figure it out as you go.
---
yh sorry, autistic me😝
---
I really like the fact that even in lowbie zones you could suddenly run into high level elite dragons  (the 4 emerald dragons + entourage)   Of course you would soon know where they are and avoid them but it must have been a great shock for a new player to run from lvl 26 satyrs into lvl 62 dragonkin...  
---
In fact I would love it if those  packs of dragonkin would roam around a bit more every now and then, to go hunting for food... (including player characters, hehe)
---
Yeah, spamming the only smart heal in the game that selects targets for you is indeed very challenging and super fun.
---
I mean, you could like that, there is nothing wrong in simplicity. But I think people that keep telling themselves that Shamans are so much fun in raids while Paladins are "just smahing one button" are in for a surprise.
---
Yea I just thought it was funny how you dounded like this had been around for a while or something :p
---
Gotta hand it to the developers / hats off to the developers
---
With that being said, if you're leveling a warrior go make friends with a priest. We love you guys and would enjoy questing together!
---
Heres an example:
---
751.	Hearth to BB
---
752.	Turn in Zanzil's Secret
---
753.	Go down by the Bank, turn in Akiris by the Bundle accept Akiris by the Bundle
---
754.	Go to the house in front of the half boat, turn in Voodoo Duesaccept Cracking Maury’s Foot (Changed this myself cause he had "accept ghost o plasm round up, which is a Desolace quest already completed)
---
755.	Get on the boat to Rachet then fly to Theramore
---
756.	Turn in Akiris by the Bundlein front of you, fly to Gadget
---
757.	Accept Wastewander Justiceand Water Pouch Bounty
---
758.	Make Gadget your home
---
759.	Go in front of the cage and grab the 2 quests off the sign WANTED: Caliph Scorpidstingand WANTED: Andre Firebeard
---
760.	Turn in Tran'rek SKIP the next part
---
761.	On the left side of town on the hill accept Gadgetzan Water Survey
---
762.	Go to The Shimmering Flats to (77, 77) and turn in Rumors for Kravel accept Back to Booty Bay
---
763.	Just beside him turn in News for Fizzle
---
764.	Go to (80, 75) and accept Keeping Pace do it by talking with zamek just south of here, has a blue ? on his head. Don’t follow him, run to rizzles house at (77, 77) and when he leaves grab the unguarded plans which turns in Keeping Pace accept Rizzle's Schematics turn it in at (80, 75)
---
765.	Hearth to Gadget
---
I had 40mins left on my HS...
---
Herbalism + engineering/mining is a good way to make a good buck. Engineering will not make you gold, but you will need it to contest herbalism nodes. If you play hunter or mage, you might be able to get by without engineering and pick up mining to get them sweet arcane crystals.
---
You see an alliance scrub riding towards your Gromsblood, you engage and hopefully get that sweet victory and herb.
---
Nothing gets the blood pumping more than 80g Black Lotus and 3 people PvPing for it.
---
The most epic vanilla dungeon IMO. Even moreso than Strat/Scholo... maybe not UBRS though. Fuck LBRS, hate that place.
---
6 is fairly ambitious. I hope that goes well for you. 
---
Yeah rested helps and your method should make 100% rested. I'd be interested to know the xp/time ratio for accruing rested xp.
---
1.5 speed mainhand? Check. Super edgy guild name that seemed so cool when you were 14? Check. Undead? Check check check. Man, that hit me right in the nostalgia. 👍
---
I don't remember so many things of last week but looking at the map I know every cranny of that beautifull map. And I'm a casual scrub. This game really is something special
---
he's gonna need more than one if he really levels as prot
---
In my opinion, this meme is getting overused.
---
Doesnt change the fact that you ranked #1 on the server for your 12-13 grind if you did it in "2 weeks each". Again this is the maximum possible. This grind is not for everyone.
---
?
---
Wait for tbc then.
---
It's challenging to die in retail. You have to do very dumb things.
---
Farm gold through professions by farming mats and sell cooldowns (mooncloth, arcanite bar, etc). Other than that, your only option is to farm mobs.
---
Considering we pug everything but the second half of Naxx and we bring new players every week, I would have to say this is not my experience at all.  Mistakes and wiles happen.  We coach players up, rebuff, and move on.  People that ask questions in discord constantly are given detailed answers and someone leaves the situation a bit better.
---
Not just my experience, but the server as a whole
---
If this is 1.12, why does it show Stormwind Harbour?  
---
Nonetheless, great map! :)
---
Loved shaman in vanilla. I'm hoping they implement the 2.0 talent trees and some new content at the end of the phases because post 2.0 was a fucking blast. Even made the other specs viable!
---
Love it dude, great work 👍
---
that pic is WAYY overused. especially in wow memes
---
That horde druid and shaman set, HAWT.
---
It's a game! Not a job you must "prepare" for. The absolute best experience is going in blind and taking your time, enjoying the exploration.
---
Of course it's a multiplayer game so you'll need others to fully enjoy it. You'll more than likely find a nice guild if you just roll on a server, play and make friends. But if you want to make sure you'll have a good time, the only preparation I recommend is finding a like minded guild (one which is friendly to new players) even before Classic launches. A lot of guilds are advertising right now and more will come. (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)
---
The stacking question has been addressed, so basically as a druid, try not to rate your mana by casting a HoT on a target they already has the work on it. 
---
Regarding druids being a week healing class, yes maybe in terms of the healing metre. But if you care less about that and now about keeping the raid alive, then they are definitely good. They have about the most efficient healing spells, and having the HoTs available for tanks will relieve the other healers. In addition they have some powerful builds that can really shine in terms of HPS, like the full T2 regrowth build. 
---
They are definitely valuable in a raid, and I can't wait to play one this time
---
I was a MMO newb in my early Dark Age of Camelot days, maybe got to lvl 30 tops. WoW was like easy mode after that experience and I was still pretty fresh then too.
---
MMO's now a days are literally a joke, in the current WoW. I'm so hype for Classic.
---
Hi, /u/olasbondolas
---
Is prot warrior survives much better than dps warrior? I leveled warrior in TBC and I remember being unkillable juggernaut after I think 30 or 40 level. My dps was about zero, so it was pretty slow grind, but I liked it, it's just my way of playing. I tried to spec arms at that time and I was dying a horrible death from 3-4 mobs, so I just respeced back. Is it the same for vanilla?
---
I raided as Druid (Feral) for the past 3 years during all content.
---
First: Yes, different kind of HotS stack, but only once.
---
Second: Druid suffers from their "hybrid" potential - so looking at the pure numbers: you wont ever reach top dps/heal - but that's not what druid is for since you bring versatility to the raid.
---
Combat Res / Innervate / Decurse and healing multiple Targets with your HoTs - or as a Feral Tanking and switching to DPS when needed
---
[Hopefully July 16th](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I did this a few times :)
---
There's nothing better than fresh noobs in a dungeon where I can mold and teach proper pulling techniques/order, mobs to watch out for, etiquette and procedure, and just general dungeon fundamentals.
---
It feels like a coaching experience and I don't care that a dungeon takes extra time to finish because I know I just helped a few people, I know I got better by reinforcing my own knowledge of a dungeon, and 
---
It's the "think they know" but don't know shit impatient players who are actually the worst players.
---
They also have the best raid healing ability in the game and a ton of utility with other totems &amp; purge.  Shamans are great.
---
This is my plan for levelling swords. 
---
2 in remorseless, 2 in sinister strike, 3 in gouge, work too riposte, work to dual wield spec then sword spec. Go for Blade flurry. Imp sprint/evasion/kick are all preference.
---
Once you have blade flurry you can go further in combat or finish up assassination with malice, lethality, murder.
---
From there go get whatever you didn’t in combat. Weapon expertise, aggression, adrenaline rush. I figure by 60 I’ll know what gear I have and how I want to respec.
---
It depends on the person for me.
---
If they're asking questions and humble, I'm fine.
---
If they're demanding and arrogant (but also stupid and bad), then I come down hard on them.
---
Jesus you private server haters need to chill out. You think private servers have increased drop rates on level 15 greys? Just fyi, the world is a better place when you're not angry all the time.
---
Definitely check out the link in the description for the direct link to the power point!  The video's nice, but it's not necessary if you don't wanna dedicate an hour :P
---
"I disagree with your last point as the top pvpers will push as hard as they need to, 5-7 days a week to make their bracket 1 honor. More skilled players win more skirmishes, have less deaths = more honor per hour than others. "
---
Wait so there will be skirmishes where death is a possibility? Enough so that better PvPers will achieve more honor per hour? That sounds like worthwhile wPvP to me.
---
If it were just mindless flightpath camping isnt it just a function of how many honorable targets fly into your trap? In which case any level 60 can wipe up a level 48.
---
There's always the fabled Devilsaur Mafia.
---
Also accurate!!
---
This shows Stormwind having a harbor.
---
It existed behind the gate apparently but you couldn't get there without wall-jumping (which won't work in Classic).
---
Yeah I keep applying for the job of "lottery winner" but so far I haven't even gotten an interview.
---
&gt;It existed behind the gate apparently but you couldn't get there without wall-jumping (which won't work in Classic).
---
I can add that I liked gold balance. I had almost enough for all my skills, but that's about it, I had to save some money for repairs! I liked profession balance, at least at those levels. You can mine a single node multiple times, so you're getting multiple skill-ups from a single node. Also a lot of ores. And that allows to level blacksmithing with very little extra-grind. And stuff from BS felt impactful, not vendor trash. It felt more balanced than now.
---
Like the sure and steady approach...and having a class that doesn't need to buy lvl 40 riding is an enormous advantage in this rare small time of low server gold.
---
On the other hand, in patch 8.2 you'll be able to transmog "hide slot" for EVERYTHING but pants.
---
If only, lol
---
Well... I guess I could just watch another guide on collecting all the dungeon keys.
---
Yeah I was gonna say it more like your primary job lol
---
I totally forgot about rested. Thanks for this.
---
I have never been in the OG black rock mountain. One of the thing im looking foward in classic.
---
I started at wod.
---
IIRC 10 days equals 1.5 levels worth of rested xp.
---
Damn I could hardly disagree more with this list, but guess thats just a cool part of classic, that they really managed to make the sets unique and very different.
---
To me all the honorable mentions are better than any of the #2-5 and Wrath is one of the ugliest set in classic imo and I think Dreadnaught is one of the coolest and most memorable sets ever, so hurts a bit to see Wrath ranked over that :D
---
Agree with the AQ sets tho, think everyone does, except that I actually think the Warlock one was decent on undead females.
---
Some of my favorites must me: Plagueheart, Dreadnaught, Judgement, Prophecy, Faith, Transcendence, Bloodfang and cryptstalker. Not too sure wich is top 5 :)
---
There is no "toxic" anything. #Nochanges is a thing. Probably should look it up and become familiar with it. Cause suggesting Blizzard make any game altering changes to Classic will just ruin the experience. Enjoy Classic as it was and as it will be or don't play. Don't come here begging for things that you think would make the game better. Go play Retail and stay away from Classic if you don't like how things were done or being re-done.
---
Yep same boat mate. I’ll just find new friends and create new adventures 👍 Good times
---
But it'll be 1.13
---
I remember in vanilla I played a hunter and I mostly played alone and just picked pets that looked cool. I think I grabbed a crab from the orc/troll starting area and eventually replaced it with a bear from god knows where. My question is can you get the pet you’re going to stick with early on or do you kind of meet them later? I never understood if it was more advantageous to replace your pet or just stick it out because you’d built a bond with it.  I’m in the unique position of only playing to like level 40 in vanilla and never touching it again until now (waiting for classic for some nostalgic reason)
---
Would you say Hunters are advantaged or disadvantaged should they come across an equally leveled enemy shaman on a PvP server.
---
I know hunters have lots of things for dealing with rogues but shamans do also have a few anti-rogue tricks &amp; I saw Shamans have 40 yard cast range. 
---
Would I need to go Marksman for the range or is staying Survival okay while leveling?
---
It's taking so long to load that I feel like I'm back on dial-up. #nochanges accomplished, bravo!
---
Best advice I can give is to join a guild wiling to help you/answer any questions you have. That made my experience much better and I stayed in the same guild through till raiding.
---
The argument against druids is based off of two things.  They have a stacking problem for their HoTs (more druids are less effective than more of any other class), and they have slow/beefy heals which is less effective over the course of a fight compared to fast/efficient healing.
---
Literally no one is suggesting taking zero druids to any content in the game.  The difference between zero and one druid is astronomical with MotW, thorns, rejuv, innervate, etc.  The problem is that the 2nd druid has less effective targets for rejuv and the 3rd has even less etc until they are spamming down ranked HT which is harder to be as effective as other heals because it is always slower.
---
Optimal druids per raid varies between 1-4 probably (1-3 resto and maybe 1 feral).  Since there are 8 classes per faction and 40 spots that means druids effectively get less than an average number of spots.  That’s fine.  Normally that means in order to get picked as a druid you must be even better than others to get that spot.  Seeing that druids are the least played class, there is actually high demand for druids for those fewer spots.
---
That’s actually small dick tanking my man
---
They were green, not purple
---
You also learn to talk with Innkeepers. Everywhere.
---
Yes I have made a few, voiced to them...though don't remember their names.  I remember Nosepick, he was a fun guy.  I might steal his name for classic
---
I think its more fun because of all of the utility it brings. You also have to work a little harder to get some of the same results. Being a heal bot in a raid won’t touch priests but you still have your uses. 
---
Alliance folks may claim shamans are strong because of endless frost shocks, wolf form, and just annoying pvp/duel ability
---
Maybe you chose the wrong pserver?  the one I played mostly on is full of welcoming friendly people, especially in the levelling guild area.  any toxic tryhards are usually found in lvl 60 guilds, which you wouldn't interact much with as a new player.
---
Ooh. Thanks Tiger.
---
Same way as before: "LFG Jintha'Alor quests"
---
They did have a ranged pull \[Link's Boomerang\]
---
You need to balance between different zone instead of farming the whole zone and move to the next. Do a couple quest in zone a, move to zone b and keep the same overall zone "progress" so all quest you do you try to keep them yellow
---
I was more talking about while leveling/pvping/grinding in the world. The healing class you enjoy at cap is only one part of the enjoyment equation. Personally I found enhance leveling quite fun, good burst, self heals, self revive, and a decently diverse set of abilities to use. Pally as ret seems significantly less enjoyable than enhance.
---
Barrens is huge.
---
It didn't - I swam from Menethil to Westfall countless times - never encountered it.   
---
Same with the Deathknight starting area, which is also on this map.   
---
Ontop of that both areas have several assets that did not exist up until 3.0
---
Yet there is no Quel Thalas/Danas. Just very confusing, is all :D
---
What if... both classes are bad.
---
Orc shaman resisted the stun. It’s gg
---
For me...
---
Alliance or Horde? 
---
Class? 
---
Race? 
---
UGH CAN"T DECIDE!
---
For me it's better to use E and Q to strafe and A and D get used for abilities. That way my fingers are closer to 1-4
---
Yeah ZF is a pain to run. Luckily people still do it since it’s easy to get to. I have so many memories of the Zombie boss though. I always seem to let people convince me that, no, there is a method to kill the boss quickly, and always end up dying :/ 
---
It’s a pretty epic dungeon though, and I love that you can show off you’re new mount in there too.
---
The 4th war has started! Long live shamans!
---
I really hope nobody actually takes this guy seriously. You honestly think all hunter speedlevelers would go BM spec if it wasn’t the objectively best leveling spec? Never thought I’d find a conspiracy theory like this in WoW
---
Travel is eventually a nuisance, that is true.  I always do something useful on a second screen  , like browsing reddit or watching something I would watch anyway later.
---
Great song lol
---
I could be wrong but if I remember correctly you could only get rested xp for 2 full levels. So if you do this strategy you might shave a full 10 minutes off your leveling. 
---
It is advantageous however for people who can only play a few hours a day or every other day. You should always log out in an inn.
---
You have the healer jump up on one of the ledges before you start the fight, and all the dps focuses on the boss and ignores the adds.
---
The healer gets all the add aggro but they just stand around because they cant reach.
---
That has already been pointed out. And I was thinking of the BC HP regen potion, and got my wires crossed.
---
Man what you said is so true. I used to take pride in knowing a good number of the quests and how to do them in a decent order to maximize my efficiency when doing a fresh server. 
---
In retail it’s just like you mentioned. They give you the illusion of choice by allowing you to select which zone you start in, then it’s just completely laid out for you. It’s convenient, but it’s not interesting.
---
They probably just won't raid. Even on retail people vastly overestimate the number of people that raid, maybe a pug here and there but for a lot of people having to set aside certain hours every week is unrealistic.
---
Ha! I forgot about pally execute.
---
And due to batching you both die :D
---
First day of summer is only 2.5 months away
---
There's definitely idiots everywhere, on retail and private servers.
---
The thing is, I've had a different experience from private servers, than you. Most people I've played with, seems to be fine with people being worse at the game or not knowing specific things. As long as you're showing willingness in adapting and getting better at the game, which is much easier than back then, since there's guides for everything now.
---
What pisses most people off, is the guy who's on purpose or because he's lazy, not doing their homework on really obvious things. Like joining a MC run and not reading mechanics/tactics and/or what consumables to bring beforehand. 
---
Joining a random Scholomance run, you should be able to do blind, without reading anything, since it's usually a 'spur of the moment' thing, unlike raids, which are scheduled weeks ahead of time. Just be open about being new or it's your first time in the dungeon, and I've seen most people being more than willing to put up with you.
---
On top of that, even in the Private Server community you have many people not being dicks, so imagine how it's going to be in Classic, with many times more players. There'll be a spot for you and for the idiots who's shouting at newbies.
---
Think about the people playing on private servers. They’re the hardcore elitists trying to minmax every aspect of the game. They’re the people who will be hitting 60 in 5 days playtime. 
---
Think about classic rerelease. Open to retail subs, some of the most casual MMO players in the genre. People who are there to enjoy the game and the fantasy, and the little victories like a new talent point every level. 
---
There are always going to be assholes, but my guess is the vast majority of players will be kind and helpful, eager to not only experience nostalgic classic again, but to enjoy your thrill of this new experience. 
---
I would recommend adding friendly group members and searching around for a casual or newbie friendly guild as well, give yourself every opportunity to surround yourself with nice people and you will have much more fun than the elitists will.
---
They’ve *gotta* hit that button in these next two weeks, and knowing that isn’t helping with the overwhelming hype.
---
It doesn't surprise me that this sub even circlejerks it's choice of meme format.
---
I don't think that's true, because otherwise you could've just swum up there from Westfall. The same goes for the Acherus terrain behind Tyr's Hand which I think shouldn't be there.
---
Great map though, I love scrolling around and discovering things!
---
Holy shit, well spotted! Will have to edit that out.. must have got the wotlk tiles for that by accident. my bad.
---
&gt;You ignore my points about joanas guide being outdated as well as in game Addons to assist with questing completely as well.
---
Yes of course i ignore this.
---
Because the way Joana plays is what I assume the vast vast majority of WoW players to play like. And with the way Joana plays he still only manages level 12 in 4 hours played, which is considerably slower than 3 hours max.
---
I also ignore the quest helper argument. Since Joana has no need for the quest helped and knows the location of every single quest item. Still he doesn't manage a time better than 4 hours. 
---
I didn't argue for the sake of arguing. I argue because there are too many misleading posts about the amount of time it takes to level. The posts have a sort of smug elitist vibe about them and don't contribute anything except spreading misinformation or giving people a distorted view of the game. If you want to talk about how fast it will take the speed runners to reach level 12 or 60 go ahead. But don't use that logic to talk about how long it should take the average person to reach those milestones.
---
I think MadSeasonShow on YouTube has some great introductory class videos to give you an idea of the headcanon of the class, rather than a strict guide. Good for beginners.  
---
Other than that I recommend just asking anything you want in-game when it launches.  There will be people happy to help, and you may make some great friends.
---
Disagree, shaman may have mana issues for dps but pallies are suuuuuper boring to dps as.
---
Yeah that 8 month dead period after Blizzcon was rough.
---
Yep, same here, only 1 of my IRL mates that played vanilla is keen and he is fairly casual while i plan to go hardcore...and the rest don't care.
---
Planning to find a hardcore guild and make new ones anyway :)
---
it is good  game..i have ever seen
---
Be totally lost at launch.
---
The advise I would give , as someone that played vanilla so long ago, is don’t do any research. Don’t watch videos. Don’t do anything that may give away the bliss that is coming for you. Wow is at is best when you experience the wonder first hand, not on YouTube. 
---
Make friends and socialize otherwise.
---
WoW is a very beginner friendly game. This is one of the reasons why it was so popular at launch.
---
But make sure you know what to play. If you choose the wrong class you have to start all over again.
---
If you care about lore play Warcraft 3. It's the best way to get into the Warcraft lore.
---
View distance and mob render distance are two different things. You can max out view distance while keeping interactive render distances the same as vanilla, and it has no implications on game balance. If all the important shit (spawns/nodes) have a max rendering distance that is the same for everyone, there are no inherent advantages to being able to see further.
---
You can absolutely do this but you're really hindering yourself. You will be out of bag space constantly since you'll have no one to mail extra items.
---
You'll most likely also be wasting profession mats by having to sell them to a vendor or you'll have to constantly travel back to a main city with an AH/bank in order to sell or store them.
---
Having at least one bank alt will improve your overall experience immensely. You gain in both bag space and time. Its really worth it.
---
Leveling a feral druid right now.
---
I'll often morph out of catform and cast Renew and Rejuvenation. Sadly, they both suck and don't usually get me back up to full health. I'll generally need to cast a Healing Touch which is a very long cast followed by the other two spells. Then get back into Cat Form.
---
I can't complain. It's better than eating or using first-aid. But it just sucks waiting for those heals then waiting for full Energy again.
---
Both Renew and Rejuv HoT spells can be on a tartet at the same time.
---
Why is everyone saying yes in Swedish many times?
---
I know I'm going to be pinballed around and dropped kicked into the lava as a tank first time in first hoard instance....whatever it's called.  Just like 15yrs ago when I first tried it.  ONLY after that I'll get my shit together.  If the elite pservers can't handle that...then fug'em.  I was always chill back in my hardcore days, the leetz can wail for a perfect tank/healz in trade all day...meanwhile the rest of us will move on.
---
Ah, okay. There’s a glitch like that for VanCleef in Deadmines, where the heals just jump on some giant cannon and let the adds disengage from the fight. I hope this gets fixed in Classic, and I think it will be. I hate the feeling of cheating your way out of a boss kill. Like, people say Classic is so braindead easy, yet people feel obligated to exploit leveling dungeons. I won’t say I don’t do it ever,  but I hope we don’t get the option to.
---
No. What will happen is that Horde will be fucking shafted by 5 enhance shamans in every BG pug thinking they can go around one shotting everyone because they say Unbreakable.
---
I had a strict "No Mara" policy in Vanilla. People get lost too easily, and a full party wipe ensures a half hour of people running around as ghosts getting lost, and then two people dropping group.
---
This is great dude. I was planning on getting a giant map poster made from a local printing shop using this map somebody here posted: [https://imgur.com/gallery/m9p1QS3](https://imgur.com/gallery/m9p1QS3)
---
Your image quality is absolutely outstanding though.
---
Can we redditors get a best of both worlds thing going on that has your image but with some landmarks, flight paths, frame border, with WoW logo, etc.?

---
Your experience with 1-2 people =/= "the current playerbase".
---
That would be interesting from a social standpoint. Would put a big wrench in the plans of all the people who intend to be head of the pack.
---
Source? Everything I've seen indicates that it takes about 3 ret pallies to equal the dps of one warrior/rogue/mage, or two to equal one warlock/hunter.
---
I love RFD. This time around I'm going to try for an X'Caliboar.
---
You later graduated in BC to be the guy who pops Bloodlust during the 30 seconds of RP after a boss pull.
---
Great guild name.
---
oof.
---
&gt; The mentality of "Min-Max the shit or don't bother coming" is returning.
---
Back in 2005 and 2006 this really wasn't a thing outside of the top guilds. A large chunk of the playerbase hadn't even hit 60 when BWL was released. The game wasn't just about raiding back then.
---
Going into Classic without any prior experience, you're going to be the envy of everyone on this subreddit. I hope you love it as we do when it comes out. Honestly I wouldn't do preparation at all, while there will be people who are knowledgable about vanilla many of us will not be familiar with a lot of the nuances and mechanics of vanilla, seeing as some of us may not have played it in more than over a decade.
---
Sure, I'll work on that next week :) 
---
Will have to space out both landmasses a bit though because as you can see they're quite close together (on purpose to save on file size).
---
Also been brought to my attention that some assets on this map are from 3.0 so I'll have to edit it again anyway to make sure it's 100% 1.12!
---
But that’s exactly what I was doing, replying to the guy before me not the OP. I was replying to him in regards to what I thought he was making a comment about which was speed levelers. How you choose to interpret things is up to you but there was no elitism involved.
---
Your last sentence is probably the case, and I doubt rankers will die often, since they will have more gear, consumables, be PvP spec, etc. whereas most other, even 60s at that point, will not.
---
I just prefer it because it's fun actually have a diverse range of abilities. I know pally has some utility but the actual output abilities has on pally leave a lot to be desired.
---
Nobody uses FD to fool the other player he's actually dead...
---
The people playing pservers right now are some of the hardcorest jade people left. A lot of the vanilla enthusiasts have taken a break before classic will come out. Pservers are always very toxic, just because they aren't very moderated, and that's fine, but it tends to push away new and nicer players.
---
The WoW community is actually hugely helpful, so I wouldn't worry about it. Vanilla is actually a community-based MMO. Everyone knows that the game isn't holding your hand, and so people will always take the time to help you out. People will even randomly take 20 minutes just to help you do one little thing, even if they don't know you.
---
Don't look at pservers right now and apply that to the Classic WoW community.
---
There are places where I can understand the argument. Ungoro is a misty, foggy, wet swamp. Its immersive to have a short render distance there. Tanaris on the other hand should have virtually no fog at all.
---
Yeah you join AV and collect herbs/ fish the whole time. Also the pve mobs in AV drop stuff, occasionally boe epics. Just win against 40 people easy.
---
On the flip side, I can't stand the inability to learn, it's unacceptable.
---
If we wipe because you did not know something that's OK. Now you know, we can move forward.
---
But there is no excuse to make the same mistake again.
---
I'm adamant on this, but to make a better experience for casuals and myself I will opt to play mostly solo or with like-minded players.
---
It’s already out actually. You just haven’t been given access.
---
Shield slam scales off Block Value, which can be found in shields and various other items and sligthly through stats 
---
The basic combo is to use shield block which increases your block value by 75% and then using shield slam to hit for a large amount and potentially dispell a shield or magic effect 
---
Haven't tested it in vanilla but you could do high crits in tbc and sometimes one shot in wrath. There are some items that increase block value by percentsages like the might breastplate. You could filter for these and highest block value and try it on a private server to see if it works
---
Famously Swifty made a video highligting its potential in early wrath 
---
https://youtu.be/7xuJmsQv6nM
---
Absolutely, they do less dps and get less usefull the more holy paldins you have. And I'm not saying any guild going for server first should fill up with ret. That would be insane.
---
If you wanna be full tryhard, you should bring a ret and kick anyone that does less dps than him^^
---
it really depends how casual u want to play it. 
---
if u just want to have some fun and go really (like reeeaaalllyyyy) casual pick whatever pet. never pick a pet with a mana bar though, they suck.
---
however pet classes are very different. also, there are spells u only learn from some pets in the world by taming them so u want to pick up those on ur journey.
---
if u want to get good pets u will find a lot of them quite late in the game.
---
for leveling on alliance side, owls are really good, actually the best (ne starting area). on the horde side wind serpents (barrens) and cats/raptors are nice. imho getting an owl on horde side is too much effort, but if u want to go for that its quite a fun task. 
---
so if u want to know an "optimal" combination of pets u want to own at 60: broken tooth from the badlands (pvp), a zul gurub wind serpent (pvp), a wolf from lbrs (pve) and then it depends; a cat from winterspring for raiding if u know what u do, maybe a boar for the stun and solo content etc. 
---
there are several sites special for hunter pets like petopia or u can go and watch kargoz youtube guide on hunters.
---
We've been allowing it but personally I think 95% of them are shit, almost entirely due to being so overused.
---
What's far more important than optimizing your 1-12 leveling route is your overall available play time.  1-12 is such a small part of the overall grind.
---
Survival is really bad while leveling and still equally bad at PvP until the late 50s. Even after that, its a passable but not great PvP spec.
---
In leveling as BM you should be favored against Shaman. As MM, if you start at max range youll have the advantage as well.
---
No but the pvp window shows your highest rank achieved
---
I wish I had some of that classic juice
---
You call yourself TedNugent and your pet Scratchfever.
---
There were only over 1,000 printed in the US. A good condition one is worth over $20,000.
---
There are dozens of streams and videos of different paladins who geared well, and play well to put them higher in the pack than a mediocre hunter/warlock pretty easily : https://youtu.be/uwneivRDpjA

Cloth OP for casters though. You are looking for stats not armor on a healer
---
pre 2.3 was basically vanilla with better talent points.  same amount of xp and all the elite quests are the same.  the quests in the 1-20 zones for draenei/blood elf are superior from a time/reward stand point would be the biggest difference.  they added a bunch of quests to eastern ashenvale but idk if that was part of the 2.3 changes (like dustwallow) or not, and there are some random new quests sprinkled around and quest/dungeon rewards were updated throughout the expansion too.  
---
but if we're talking the tbc pserver experience (all of the above included) it is way faster.  30% less xp from 20-60, mounts at 30, better quest rewards, soloing old group quests make 1-58 (i usually stay in old world until 62 to maximize quest gold at 70) really fast.  in my experience i can get 1-70 in a similar amount of time as i can get 1-60 on a vanilla server
---
When I first played retail we had no idea hunters would fall off damage wise as raids progressed. Now that we do, does anyone worry that people will accept less hunters early on in preparation for later raids? All that gear could go towards better scaling dps classes.
---
lol we have been arguing about two completely different things then.
---
There is a phenomenon that I've noticed more and more and I wonder if it has a name. When something is so precisely crafted that it loses all of its organic nature. When it loses that abstract "soul" that it should have. When it begins to resemble everything else instead of being its own thing.
---
The older grocery store vs. the carbon copy new style. The old neighborhoods that built up naturally and sort of randomly vs. the pre-designed, soulless clone houses. Mass Effect 1 vs. Mass Effect 3. 
---
"Overdesigned" is probably the word.
---
Ah my bad, maybe I'm getting the name wrong; I had to Google Warlock Tier sets because it was over 10 years ago and thought that looked like the right one... Maybe it was Felheart
---
Upvoted this because you're completely right - everyone's got their own taste and it's amazing how we can all find reasons to love, or hate, certain sets for various reasons.  
---
That being said, Prophecy all the way. Can't wait to rock out that red yellow and black as an MC raider! \^\_\^
---
The pets as of the 1.12 mechanics, only have unique attack speed and second, are only unique based on their type (ie. cat, bear, wind serpent, etc.). For stats, a level 1 that you level up to 60 will have the same stats as if you tamed a level 60 of that type. 
---
You do tend to replace your first pet, but you can keep it forever. However, only certain levels of pets have certain abilities. Ie. the LBRS worgs are the only ones with Furious Howl R3. Now you dont need to use that specific worg all the time though. The way it works is you tame a beast with the ability you want, use it for a while, the Hunter then "learns" the ability and then you can teach it to other pets you have. Kind of awkward system but its how it works. So you can use the same pet all the way to 60, but if you want it to learn new activated abilities, then youll have to tame other pets along the way to learn them.
---
Lmao great, well let’s go run a 5 man /shrug
---
Ohhh, yes. In situations where a guild purposefully gimps the rest of their players in order to funnel all their best gear drops onto a ret pally, the ret pallies end up middle of the pack.
---
Join a friendly guild. You are welcome in mine if you like.
---
Is bio slang for taking a piss/shit?
---
True I just pvp a lot so tab target isn’t always the best option and forgot this was a pve thread.
---
Dude don’t practice in a private server, don’t ruin the experience just play the game and learn along the way.
---
Don’t worry about people getting mad at you they will understand. You won’t hVe fun if you try to appease to people who know the game
---
&gt; (Need 3 more people. Warning: One person will be scarificed at random) 
---
Win - win in my book!
---
Crap...rested xp is still a thing this early in game?  I could have sworn it came in later due to some Korean guy dying in internet cafe while leveling up an alt
---
Yeah classic really had some beautiful and cool looks, the majority of the sets are very well done, and even the ones i dislike, i see why people like them. Yeah im going for priest when classic comes aswell, i didnt even think about the sets before i made that decision, but looking at the sets now just made me want to do it even more! :)
---
Even still its all 1 instance.  So the maximum at the end of vanilla was 10 man,  and they designed all the quests to be completed.  Therefore the quests are labeled as raid.
---
Have used long flight points several time to stand up and stretch a bit, stimulate my back a bit and so on, I can recommend it wholeheartedly.
---
Yes....
---
yes, but it was very buggy. I used it around 2015, sorry  don't know any details because I switched to one of the 2 map addons everybody was using.   If you find one of those torrents with 2000 vanilla wow addons it should be in there.
---
Kill a lot of people and keep killing them.
---
Who hurt your feelings / took your raid loot my guy?
---
What do you mean by "their whole play experience has been a lie"? I'd agree that private servers and vanilla are going to be VERY different from a community standpoint. Private servers have a tendency to have some highly concentrated toxicity. Game mechanics will be very similar at the least though. The "good" private servers are far more accurate than the haters give them credit for.
---
Not for me.  I was questioning OPs number of alts.
---
&gt; Especially considering the "peer pressure" if you will of community posts about how much better the Horde is at (nearly) everything due to racials. 
---
That's only the case for PvP, and not a very drastic difference afaik (paladins are supposedly great pvp healers). The "peer pressure" in PvE is heavily towards alliance due to their superior racials/paladins.
---
Its 1.5 levels
---
I think there used to be more levels to it in alpha then they toned it down.
---
This. Being able to down the bosses consistently is enough. The vocal PServer guilds who min/max everything do it not because it's 100% necessary, but because they want to optimize their time in raids and clear all the content every week. Unless your goal is to be in a hardcore raiding guild, just get the best gear you can get and get good at your class and spec. Casual raiding guilds will be probably clear 2x 40 mans a week, with off-nights having breakout groups to go do 20 man content.
---
Durotar also has that second zeppelin tower for the Borean Tundra and Thunder Bluff added in 3.0.
---
I think it will be released on Tuesday
---
She's a keeper for sure!
---
Thanks, anything else guys let me know and I will edit.
---
I might get one of my friends to play, but otherwise I will have to rely on barrens chat for help.
---
Gimme a hit. Just one, I promise just this one time.
---
You are right, the better your gear, the more buffs you have, the more rage you generate and you will have to use OP less and less. But it's still an awesome ability, especially in MC when your gear is not that great yet and of course if you lose your worldbuffs it's really good not just because of the damage but also because it almost guarantees to proc flurry.
---
I just think that saying that furys just have to use 2 buttons and then spam HS/Execute makes the class seem much blander than it is :D
---
I didn't realize there were such devout followers of an online game's rule book. Relax, they're not laws. People just wanted to play the game they loved from the past. They're not exactly troublemakers.
---
When I first started in classic; I almost quit.  Some random mid level dwarf priest helped me out and explained things, and I ended up playing nonstop up until Wotlk... 
---
I don’t know whether to love or hate that dwarf :p
---
Her: I wonder if he's thinking about other women.
---
Him: I wonder if The Flash can't wear briefs due to chaffing...
---
Ugh I was really hoping for a blue update this morning, I need my fix.
---
Yeah. For a lot of people, lfr is good enough for them.
---
Neither are DPS classes though, they're healers, so kind of a moot point
---
Haha yeah, that used to be my Gnomeregan policy. But maybe it will be easier this time around, especially if alot of the population comes from retail WoW, where people just blast through the dungeons on repeat. I can't imagine how hard it will be to get people to the portals, though.
---
Honestly, you're in an envious position most people around here would kill to have.
---
Simply put, you get to experience the magic of classic without the shadow of what retail WoW has become and without private servers tainting your view of how it should / could be.
---
I wouldn't touch retail WoW or private servers right now if I were you, just hold out a few more months if you can and see what the old vanilla days were all about. It's a great experience and you won't miss out on anything by not spending the next few months min/maxing everything. There will be people power leveling and trying to hit 60 and get best-in-slot gear but there will be even more people taking their time enjoying experience that you can play with.
---
Like the guy who is too sensitive to say his opinion because he is T E R R I F I E D that people will tell him they dont agree? ))
---
I was a scrub gnome warlock back in vanilla and had a competition against an UD rogue farming for elemental water in Felwood.  I think he must have killed me like 10 times and I never got him. I was pretty bad at PVP, but that was so frustrating.  I kept trying everything in my spell book to beat him.
---
In classic elemental resitances were different. Wold buff are almost imposible to get just before raid time. Consumables are fucking expensive since there a lot few mats to farm in the world (private servers changed spawn rates) etc etc. A dedicated player will always beat a race/class combo who doesnt do shit and will demand gear for his existence alone.
---
To be fair, if I was a warrior and popped Recklessness, I'd be raging too. But you should totally wait for that shit before you pop your CDs.
---
do you have to use photoshop to make one of these??  
---
tell me quick i have a good one!!!!!!
---
I know everyone hates it but Blade's Edge Mountains is the main zone I think of with TBC. Loved exploring that place. That and Shadowmoon Valley. But I really do love all the TBC zones, I think we still saw some of the classic world-first thinking there since Outland/original Draenor was pretty well defined in the lore.
---
Yeah I 100% agree, that was a bit of my point. You can make anything sound dull if you want, but there is allways more to it. Rets seems like aa bots but they are far from it, same with warriors having "2 button". No class in the game presses 1-2 buttons (even locks and mages) during a raid encounter, if you do, then you are'nt playing to the max.
---
I've recently found this image on my hard drive - probably the only one I have from playing through vanilla. Had to dance here for a while to capture it back for the Horde! Sadly these objectives were kinda empty most of the time on my server.
---
I would say Uldaman, wide level range of mobs and the biggest pulls are on the high level range as well. The Trogg pulls near grimlock are high level, hit hard and come in large packs, as well as run away in a room filled with more big groups. After that, you have fairly high level AoE groups that have very high armor constructs in them. Then finally Archaedes, a level 47 boss in a dungeon run mostly by level 42s, is already a hard boss not accounting for level.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
&gt;For dungeons I like everyone having to put in the effort to show up to fight your way to the instance door.
---
Thats why i wont be rolling a warlock. Farming shards is ok, hearing the "you can summon me" on every single dungeon group is a big no for me. Everyone colaborates and you demand a summon after slacking for the last half an hour?
---
The truth hurts. Reroll ele and embrace the boom
---
Respect. Time to break into those Surges you've been storing since 2000 and start the energy-train a'roarin.
---
Might be true for raiding but shamans are bad mother fuckers in pvp, wpvp, and dungeons.
---
yeah, ya'll should probably rethink some of this  
---
best thread ive seen all week being removed is a little... off
---
This makes me hopeful. We need noobs! One of the great things about vanilla was that no one knew what the hell they were doing. 
---
Dont play on a private server. Just go in fresh and figure it out.
---
Yeah you could spend a good 2-3 hours in BRD as level 50-58s, just clearing out the lower city. It's such a fun experience visiting each area. It's really hard to get past The Lyceum though, as 50s.
---
If Classic is even halfway successful then private server players will be in the minority. It will be a highly skilled and elite minority since they've had years for practice. I know private servers have had a bad reputation but trust me when I say there are some wonderful and kind people who play on them. Like with anything there are exceptions.
---
So don't worry about them ruining your time and others. You can easily ignore the shitheads.
---
Badge turn ins give some money to keep you going, concerted effort especially so. I've usually found that income good enough to keep pvping while chugging swiftness pots as needed. You'll still see a net negative but without a decent enough starting sum you can get whatever rank you want without much of a money problem. of course if you're horde and need faps to compete with alliance you're shit out of luck.
---
Well, I played a Hunter in a semi-hardcore guild on a private server through AQ40, so I have a little bit of insight here. The thing is, the gear that you end up not getting in favor of a Fury Warrior or a Rogue is 1. not as plentiful as you'd think and 2. not as big of a deal as you'd think, for a few reasons. Before I get into that though, I just wanna make it clear that guilds will still bring 1-3 hunters even into Naxx for utility and to pick up drops no one else uses, so don't worry about "becoming outdated" or replaced or whatever. If you perform well and really wanna raid super deep then you absolutely can, and if you don't wanna go into Naxx, then Hunter is still somewhat of a beast in T1-T2 gear anyway and mandatory for some mechanics.
---
To start off, as a Hunter, your pet is always going to be a static source of damage as long as you can control it and keep it alive, so that's a chunk of your overall DPS that we can consider unaffected by this (even if it's part of the reason you don't scale).
---
When we talk about gear that will be given to other physical classes over you, it's really just stuff like Onyxia pendant, other rings and stuff later on, and maybe some leather offpieces. The reason for this is that Hunter Tier itself is amazing, you have priority on the good DPS bows/guns (which make up a massive portion of your DPS as a MM hunter), and there is stuff outside of raid like Tarnished Elven Ring, Don Julio's Band, Blackhand's Breadth, DM Trinker that don't even require you to compete with your other raiders for gear while still being incredible BiS items for a LONG time.  Your melee are also stat-sticks with bad base damage, ie stuff that warriors/rogues won't want.
---
Basically, most of the gear besides Ony neck early on is either obtainable outside of raid, or only given to hunters. Random offpieces will definitely go to your Rogues/Warriors over you most of the time but they're such tiny upgrades. stuff like rok'delar/chromaggus crossbow is gonna go to your hunters anyway. The few pieces that you have to wait for like Ony neck you will get eventually anyway if you play for a long time, because Ony is easy, the neck is guaranteed, and it's twice a week lockouts.
---
Between Hunter tier and priority weapons, quest items that are BiS, and Rep/dungeon items that are BiS, you basically don't have to worry about losing priority on gear. The entire reason people bring hunters is to ABSORB gear. This was kinda long but hopefully the specific details help
---
Taking skill out of the equation kinda makes this all pointless if you ask me. If a bunch of noobs run around dueling eachother it's just going to be a random mess. You really can't predict a winner there.
---
Yeah irk where you heard of that but who ever made it is just stupid or phishing for views (if it came from a video)
---
All the raids, not including naxx, can be completed with unorthodox specs and classes. Players are better today and its easier to get accurate information. I think youre going to be surprised with how the raiding scene in vanilla turns out.
---
This worked well for me when I played on a p server.
---
"Guys, I haven't been here in over a decade, any tips?"
---
200-300 is the goal for the fights you need it.    
---
Much of that can be obtained from buffs.  Then about 3-4 good pieces of gear.
---
Reckbomb ideally wont work.
---
Shammie time
---
I think there is a vocal minority of private server players that make people think they are all hyper elitist and upset about everything. But in reality, most private server players are similar to the average player who will play Classic. They just have a bit more experience actually playing it.
---
This is the wrong subreddit for reviewing private server gameplay.
---
Extremely rare.  Most of the people in my guild had alts parked on top of spawn points, and would switch between them after raids and whatnot to check for spawns.  If you stood on a spawn point for a few minutes you’d see a bunch of people logging on and off next to it.   So it really became a guild level effort to supply an alchemist with them.
---
Theyve already said they plan on 1.12 talents iirc
---
I think there will be a lot of people like you. I imagine laughing at the people calling others scrubs and thinking "hey, I was kind of like that 15 years ago"
---
Meh I disagree, leveling a shaman has been the least fun for me out of any of the classes I tried. Maybe except for paladin. The peak was getting the full SM armory items tho, wearing all those items was awesome.
---
Someone photoshop Esfand's face on him!
---
You wouldn't take all of the same talents
---
OP, if you need any help, please do not hesitate to DM me, I'll be happy to help you!
---
&gt; I'll often morph out of catform and cast Renew and Rejuvenation. 
---
Druids do not have Renew
---
I'll be staying horde for the nostalgia and changing class for the novelty.
---
I couldn't faction change any more than I could start supporting a different football team, but I could change class like changing job.
---
&gt; ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༼つ SUMMON THE RELEASE DATE ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༼つ
---
Dalaran Crater is in there as well
---
I'm right there with you, so many tempting choices. I'm a sucker for going healer, but also want something useful in PvP. So the question is if I should level one for healer for PvE and then have a secondary character for some fun PvP, like a mage, rogue, or maybe hunter :|
---
[deleted]
---
They were designed to be dps and heal (and tank for paladin) but the math didnt turn out well. The community decided they were strictly healers. You can dps as either in raids, you just wont be as efficient as other dps classes.
---
&gt; Now thinking over this this would seem entirely correct because you basically spam HoTs for Vael 
---
waT?
---
Ah, right.
---
Flasks won’t make or break how people treat hybrids.
---
Hardcore guilds still won’t take them but some semi-hardcore and most casual guilds still will (which would have happened flasks or not).
---
Not to mention some hybrids don’t get much of anything out of flasks (enhancement shaman and ret pala for example)
---
Teeb, you've done it again!
---
Look up Hobbs on youtube.  He was a guy on a server I joined because of what he used to do.  He would run noobs through instances all the time with his paladin with every single damage on hit item you could get!  He really was the Bob Ross/Mr Rodgers of WoW for me.  Don't wreck your experience on a pserver.  Wait for the game to come out, we all did!  We talked about how amazing it was going to be and what class we were going to play... ride the hype train while it lasts!
---
It won't change the mentality of the min max crowd. With flasks being even more valuable, it will put an emphasis on having good dps in every raid slot since quick clears are the goal of these types of raids. 
---
These guilds were never going to take a boomkin etc, in the first place.
---
I'm not sure what server you were playing on, but instant respawns just aren't true. On the private server I was playing on, I had to run around and look for mobs in most places. Princess had a 5+ minute spawn timer, goldtooth was about a 3-5 minutes, hogger was 5ish minutes, normal kobolds were decently quick, but still had 45sec - 1 minute. The only mobs that were instantly back up were basiclly murlocs and i remember those really screwing with me on live too so i dont know how much changed there. 
---
With sharding and having a very limited number of people around you, you wont have issues in the starting areas. Might have a SLIGHTLY longer leveling time from 1-10, but it wont be noticeable. I can do 1-10 in 2 hours and 10 minutes as of right now. That may go up to 2.5 hrs or 2 hr 45 minutes. By that time I should be ahead of the curve and not worryng about people too much.
---
Love the analogy!
---
Grew up with Ultima Online. Wow was easy mode
---
I just need the release date of the release date for the release date ya feel? *eye twitch*
---
Thank you, can’t ask much more in terms of a clear answer. That seems like a decent system, at least druid b’s rejuv doesn’t overwrite druid a’s
---
Probably August 1 because that is when I move and won't have internet for a week.
---
Yeah, bc for some reason people feel the need to tell you they're going for a shit rather than just saying brb 2 mins.
---
It still blows my mind that people think WoW's death penalty is that controversial. WoW was the first MMORPG to essentially eliminate the death penalty. In EverQuest you could lose hours worth of experience, and even revert back to your previous level. You would respawn without any of your gear, and have to trek back naked to where you died to loot your own corpse. If you forgot to get your soul bound nearby, you could respawn an hour away.
---
All of this facilitated social interaction. Clerics (and Paladins sorta) could resurrect you, returning you to your body and restoring a large amount of your lost experience. Druids and Wizards could teleport you closer to where you died. Anyone could help you fight your way back to where you died and retrieve your corpse.
---
Without a death penalty there's no sense of danger, no fear for your virtual safety. There's no RPG. Where's the fun in that?
---
The *lack* of death penalty is actually one of my main complaints with classic WoW. I never feel like I'm taking risks, because dying just isn't that big of a deal. It makes the game feel a bit more arcadey and anti-social.
---
A.
---
Not only will the race to 1st guilds push as hard as possible, because they already did that, but I believe even a few of the mild guilds will be less tolerant of off-meta specs.
---
There will ALWAYS be those guilds that will allow anyone who wants to be there to show up, but some of the possibilities to compensate for being off-meta was the fact you could go all out to be more competitive, where maybe a mage or rogue didn't because they don't feel like they needed to. That allows someone to be much more competitive than now, where they might not have the capability of flasking as regularly.
---
pick whatever class and race sounds cool to you and use keybinds
---
Dude literally everything smashes one button in raids. Look at mages.
---
I still saw it a few times on a private server. It was just really rare.
---
Reckbomb will work just fine, /sit is another subject
---
Ah man, this was a huge hit when it dropped back in the day. Well-edited videos weren't common back then.
---
My understanding is the hybrid classes usually got a couple of spots even in the min max guilds. Boomkin for example with the inervate for the healer, extra battle res (on top of the 3 you already have from healers) and for the crit buff for mages.
---
In private servers, this is usually the case. you dont think it will be the same on retail?
---
I  think veterans are going to help new players out more than others because they know the game and what it takes, and understand what it means to be a new player. As long as you ask for help and tell people you're new you'll be fine pretty much.
---
What time is it? 
---
Where he at?
---
Now that’s a name I haven’t heard for a long time. I wonder if he’s planning to play vanilla.
---
&gt; The truth hurts. Reroll ele and embrace the boom
---
Then reroll resto and realize the mages can do the boom much better than you can, where you can be the purge/heal/totem/earth shock king you were designed to be.
---
Private server user base is toxic AF. 
---
I think some of that mentality will transfer over (lord knows its present on retail), however the vast majority of people playing classic will be people who either never played or havent played in 15+ years. And the private server community is pretty small, all things considered. 
---
My solace is that most toxic no life Pserver players dont work, which makes it really tough to justify $15 a month on a 15 year old game.
---
Do it!  I think the switch gives a better overall play experience.
---
I played Horde in 2005-2008.  I played Alliance in 2015-2019 (vanilla pservers)  So in Classic I will switch again to Horde because now I am more unfamiliar with the horde again.
---
Yeah, there will probably be a lot of that, which I'd hope would be pretty understandable.
---
Toxic people are everywhere. That's never going to change.  
---
But there will be plenty of people who you will become friendly with.  
---
Hell, I met a holy priest in SM who not only taught me how to tank, but became a very good friend.  I've done work for and with him in RL, and we are both super excited to get back to vanilla.
---
My birthday is May 19th. That would be the best God damn present ever.
---
It was [Linken's Boomerang]
---
double oof
---
You think that’s bad? I don’t even have a useable pc yet 😅
---
Oh no, it changes everything. I'm so confused.
---
More like he says "I don't heal, I'm ret". &lt;swords leaving sheaths&gt;
---
That's a nice opinion you've got yourself there
---
Having played alliance all of classic I laughed out loud at this. Awkward in a quiet office. Things are funnier when they’re true.
---
I was intitially confused at the raid I picked to look at simply because it was mostly HoTs which overall in most fights made no sense and is extremely mana inefficient, and then noticed it was the Vaelstraz fight. You get unlimited Rage/Energy/Mana during the fight, one person gets a buff to godmode and blows up after like, I dunno 8-10 seconds?, while the rest of the raid takes heavy AoE damage. You can stick 1 druid per caster/ranged group and have the HoTs cover the healing with enough healing gear, and some time to cast a HoT or two on another group that is running Prayer of Healing spam Priest or Chain Heal shaman to lend a hand if they need it. But yeah, you literally spam your HoTs to keep your group alive and they last just long enough to simply go down the line and keep your group up single handedly usually.
---
Cause ally quests in hillsbrad are 32+ my dude lol
---
Bruh wtf that's what I'm doing.
---
what class will you play
---
Classic wow not magic the gathering
---
He probably meant regrowth
---
One of the best things os experiencing something the first time.
---
I think a good idea would be to try the FF14 trial. Its a similar system, so you wont: Ruin your start by playing retail WoW, Ruin your start by private server experiences, ruin your start too much knowledge.
---
Meanwhile, you get to learn the basic grasps of the combat system, experience another world with different story telling, other classes...
---
If you wont like FF14 - nothing lost. If you like it but like WoW classic better due to varying factors: Even better. If you only like FF14, you at least found another mmorpg thats on the top list on the market.
---
Aesthetics and presentation are different enough for you to not fall into the "played one mmo, played them all" trap, and FF14 early game is usually pretty shit, so you wont see the "better" parts of the combat to get you hooked in the trial anyways. In addition, WoW combat is way more responsive and its something you will definitely appreciate, giving it a boost over ff14's superior story telling.
---
Just my2c
---
I know we want this, but we don’t want this. We want it when it’s ready for launch.
---
Genuine question: 
---
Are Resto shamans good in Classic? I have been playing Resto since Late WOTLK and wanted to play a Troll Resto shammy in Classic.
---
Lol what the fuck does that have to do with trinketing a fucking seduce
---
I just wanted to meme, my dude
---
I think he's talking about when naxx been out for awhile, feels like they can either go with OSRS way, do nothing or the TBC way.
---
no you don't.
---
You spam regrowth which is why Druid's are doing 1500 hps on Vaelstrasz
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/
---
By this patch you can't proc WF off WF and, Trinket stacking is nerfed. All the real shaman fun from classic is already nerfed. I gotta say though. Had a blast leveling my shaman. Lying to myself about how amazing Enhance was and about how I would go ele once I got into AQ was enjoyable.
---
Unforunately resto is just really bad. :(  
---
Talent wise an elemental and resto really do not differ much as lots and lots of talents of resto cater 100% to PvE like 31er 5HP 5min CD totem or the +mana improvemen. 
---
But this is also the beauty. Just take your heal equip into the BG and change gear mid match to go from elemental to resto.
---
Yes. The nice way of saying it.
---
&gt; I'd be interested to know the xp/time ratio for accruing rested xp.
---
10 days to get 1.5 levels of rested. So leveling only with max rested bonus would take 400 days. one year, a month, and a week.
---
I believe it will have the reverse effect: private servers are slightly easier with world buffs and easier access to flasks.
---
If the content is harder, the need for proper dps increases, therefor less room for fucking around with sub optimal hybrid classes.
---
That’s only in theory though, I’m sure some people will accept them especially in MC and other early raids. It really depends on how confident the raid leader is that the hybrids won’t slow down the progress too much, or how much time he’s willing to sacrifice.
---
That's why you get ganked with an attitude like that
---
Yeah, but getting into those levels quickly and efficiently will be the difference between being in the bulk pack or not. Also, in terms of there being no Addons at launch, due to there possibly not being a beta... Its good to know where your going through muscle memory!
---
Everyone is saying to not practice at all but I can understand you at least wanting to learn the ropes a little bit. The game is not nearly the same anymore but a lot of the basics are similar so what I would recommend doing is playing the retail free trial to level 20 on a race/class that you don’t plan on playing in classic. This would allow you to get a better hold of movement, casting abilities, auto attacking, looting, and everything like that without spoiling the story line and immersion that you will be able to experience your first time playing classic.
---
I use "noob" as a term of endearment here.  There are bound to be new players  that need a helping hand running ST or LBRS.  And to the people calling others scrubs... I'd rather have a tight group of 50 "scrubs" than a T3 tank no one wants to party with because of a bad attitude.
---
On nost people could enter dm, why was that btw?? oh right becaue there were good guilds on both factions. On later priv servers organized rankers either only played ally or horde and thats why you couldnt do dm on ND. You guys are obviously also the bad players of the priv servers.
---
I had no problem ranking/leveling on fresh nd as horde even though it was clearly alliance dominated. I made friends and made groups to contest whoever were in the way and it  was a lot of fun. The fun died quickly since everyone just roll over against prems and i had already ranked in a prem previously and knew how boring it is to literally just sit and get free wins for weeks after a couple of games. The funny thing is all the casual players who actually has a chance of ranking in phase 1 if blizzard does this is not gonna be able to rank if wsg gets implemented and if they try, theyre gonna be even more upset because they will just get farmed to no end.
---
People who do this get the AGI totem instead.
---
Good luck duo leveling, that is truly a hell I wouldn’t wish on anyone
---
NEYES WORK.
---
That shadow priest then goes out into the world after the raid is done and proceeds to vent their frustration by murdering everyone they see :p
---
I’ve said it before but this is the one aspect of vanilla I hated. The HWL/GM grind is 100% about account sharing and collusion with other high rank players. That’s it. And it rewards some of the best gear in the game. I am a little salty because I peaked in vanilla before R13 and couldn’t climb higher without literally skipping sleep. It’s a completely broken system. 
---
I know blizzard won’t change it to maintain authenticity, which I respect since I generally prefer having very few changes from vanilla, but I wish there was a better way to make R14 competitive and exclusive without the shenanigans.
---
I made one of these as well, and I have it hosted on a local server with openlayer and a leaflet version, where I was working on incorporating a leveling guide onto it. 
---
Having a browser based, zoomable, searchable, seamless map is pretty handy. Especially with a built in guide.
---
The one I created is more of a vanilla map, too (ie no stormwind harbor, 1.12 content and earlier). I didn't want to release it, since I don't have the guide finished.
---
There are a ton of these already out there (I've seen like 3 posted in the past few months). A few of the guys have guides how to make it, which are really interesting.
---
Here's some more info for interested people that I've compiled in researching the topic to create my own a few months back:

Number 7 looks very similar to ops, even when it says it's the vanilla map, it includes the sw harbor.
---
If you want some help or want to expand on your map, hit me up! Maybe we can collab. I have a background in real life map creation, analysis, development, etc.
---
2 words my friend. 
---
Thrash. Blade.
---
Shhhh, I don’t want to be self aware
---
Haven't seen a video. I just think blizzard maybe a little hurt so many people want classic and not the live game.
---
Warrior leveling is best as 2h fury/arms up till 40 when you can get Mortal strike, then you just level as arms till 60. You can tank dungeons just fine with either spec. Prot is absolutely awful to level as in classic it's not worth doing in any way.
---
It was not a common case for these fast clear guilds to have hybrids or non-meta dps slots, I have to disagree with your assertion. The reason you posted aren't relevant to the guilds who don't wipe, don't need a B rez or bring consumables. It's just the way things work at the highest levels of raiding in classic. 
---
Hybrids for the most part will be relegated to casual guilds or semi-hardcore guilds, and usually if you know someone in that guild, or if the leadership has a pre-existing liking for these corner case specs.
---
NS-LB-CL-ES or gtfo
---
Uh akshually....you want Grace of Air totem more since it lets you push more dps before having to stop
---
This is a big oof. First of all the go-to Shaman PvP spec is an elemental/resto hybrid. Secondly Elemental has more burst than mages and have offhealing, purge, tremor totem, etc. Obviously mages have some incredible value but elemental can be just as useful.
---
It definitely wasn't a ret paladin, that's for sure. My guild never gave them any loot! Lmfao
---
You're making me feel like I'm tripping balls here, Regrowth is a HoT with an initial burst heal, and I should correct HoTs to just Regrowth since Rejuv is basically trash. You spam the Green Spikey icon is correct.
---
Never went out of my way for resistance gear, highest raid content I completed was a single boss in Naxx (Raz). Onyxia Hide Cloak is the only thing most raiders really need. Tanks might need max for some fights, but I think some things don't care about resists. For instance, Ragnaros deals fire damage on melee attacks, but I think the damage he does is reduced based on Armor and Defense, not Fire Resistance.
---
Yea for sure you are correct but we all know 90% of the shamans have ZERO interest in healing lol which will keep them from getting the good ele gear to begin with
---
Brilliant. I'll invite my parents to stay with me so they can yell at me to get off the computer and go outside. Also to have loud arguments with eachother every now and then.. sweet nostalgia
---
As we have already April I'm also curious when Blizzard will reveal the release date. Are any conventions soon where Blizzard takes part? Next big one would be E3 as far as I know. Would be rather late.
---
Yeah I never got that. I raid on a few private servers as a Holy Paladin, got gear and went either Shockadin or Ret for PvP.
---
Idk healing isn’t for everyone and Shaman healing is rough sometimes, I did it a few times. It’s a tougher curve to learn.
---
Same for me! But I'm leaning more towards horde.
---
Swifty. Ye he played in vanilla but I for one is excited to how he will do after all these years.
---
Some people here should stick to PvE servers.
---
Best maps for planning grinding. I use them every day.
---
No CC without being able to do comparable damage to the other classes without a CC.
---
but cats are a little bit better than wolves on most fights, why do gods dont know this?
---
Whack-a-mole healing made me lol
---
See you there you stinky orc
---
That's almost 15 years old - and - we could play on pservers of we really wanted.
---
Except ele/resto is a really good premade BG spec
---
Imagine being this much of a brainlet
---
It's not the destination, it's the ride.
---
Daddy needs his juice
---
well that wasnt very nice
---
I have always been Horde, but this expansion has made me start to get sick of it. I am thinking as a redo i'll switch. But I haven't decided yet. 
---
The real factor is I want to avoid the elitist ass holes. I feel like Horde may have more of those.
---
I am thinking of the other ability.
---
Are you positive that's how rejuv overwriting worked in vanilla.
---
My most recent experience is from private servers, but there it was definitely possible for a weaker renew to overwrite a stronger one. Same as having a weaker stam buff overwrite a stronger one.
---
Just wanted to drop a quick thank you to OP for this post. I read every post in new due to being bored at work and OVERYhyped for classic. This post and all the responses have genuinely made me smile and relive those Vanilla memories that are buried so deep I could never remember them until someone else mentions them. Truely has been the best part of my day. 
---
Cheers bruv
---
My dad got to r12.99 in classic, the premade told him to sit so he wouldn't mess up the brackets for r14. It was his last week on the grind as he was leaving for 6 week business trip. He had a mailbox full of marks of honor and did play for the last 2-3 days of the week.
---
&gt; , but the early levels of 305 instead of 300 is insanely good
---
how good tho? like did anyone do a dps test with and without?
---
I think most people are fine with releasing more expansions as long as however it's done there aren't any forced upgrades to existing servers.
---
The lack of flasks is the least of hybrid issues.
---
What class and race are you now? I'm a holy paladin. If I wish to continue as that, I have no choice but Alliance. The struggle!
---
I love Tangled
---
Hmm, I could have sworn it was 55 and below that were gray. Guess I was remembering it incorrectly.

Sadly I can only currently get 6 Mbps at my house, so that part is true for me right now 😫
---
Yes you can have both up at the same time, multiple druid however cannot have them up on the same target.  So if you aren't the rejuv/regrowth guy enjoy spamming healing touch in raids.
---
Classic is for everyone, hardcore and casual alike.
---
Another fat, another post concerning release date
---
need more snow :( :( :( :(
---
It is worth it to do dungeons once with all the quests you have for them.... of course
---
Yep. That mentality wasn't very pervasive, and the vast, vast, vast majority of guilds never even walked into Naxx.
---
Aww, thanks! Thats pretty much the entire reason I made the thread haha. Just filling time til this dreadful wait is over :)
---
BTW do you have an opinion on the question?
---
Crafting gear while you level that provides an upgrade

I had a mod that showed all the places where I had found herbs. Eventually I would just do a route for the black lotus'. In my experience best places were always EPL &amp; WPL.

Not sure which server has 8-12 min spawns? What it should be is one per hour in one of valid zones. On some super-high-pop pservers that won't work so you may see different rules. On the server with the 1h rule (and more valid spawn points to make spawn camping harder) the price of BL is at 80-120g and flasks 120-160g and it's not something that you see often on a raid group. With the 80/20 rule - 80% of the times the tanks will have a Flask or Titans, often provided by the guild as a joint operation. 20% some other people will have it if the progression is that demanding and the lotus is reasonably available. And if guild can get some BL then the flasks will go to toons that will benefit the most out of them - so also cherry picking out of 40 man group. If you could pop a flask that noticeably improves your performance every raid run it would be cool, but that  doesn't happen in vanilla normal circumstances.
---
As for hybrids - it all depend which one and what content and if it's a realm hardcorish class stacking guild. Like it's kind of annoying to have a mana-bar based melee on Ragnaros as it would have to stand away from every other melee (and ranged). Ret and Enhancement are screwed, Feral can't powershift. If you can adapt to such cases as a hybrid, are consistent, have the normal consumables, enchants etc then you are ready to raid. The only thing you may run into is loot priority if your BiS overlaps a Warrior/Rogue or Lock/Mage BiS :)
---
Im curious to why you would censor the chat in a picture that is taken approximately 14 years ago lol
---
You can script view distance further than the settings allow too with a macro
---
Ironically in PvP I never felt like a bot on my shaman until BC arenas.
---
2 hunters + shaman. Half the matches I had enough time to just pop blood lust and die.
---
I didn't know about this site, pretty cool! Brings back some memories for sure. :)
---
Yeah he’s right there’s a macro you can literally make wow a top-down if you want
---
Yes, they're great. Raids will bring a lot of them.
---
My (limited) understanding is that those amazing rare pets won't be as overpowered anymore. But you'll still want to get a fast attack speed pet, general lions and wolf's iirc. Someone correct me if I am wrong!
---
No but seriously. I think if blizzard gave players a way to create their own texture packs that would be cool. I would prefer for it to stay 100% blizzlike but people will be doing that shit anyway and it would suck to get banned by anti-cheat for that.
---
ganking lowbies is like a mating call for WPvP
---
Lets just thank Kevin Jordan for convincing Blizzard to make factions and pvp on WoW
---
Yes. Abandon those savages and come to the civilized faction.
---
Rejuv is basically trash?
---
I guess comments like this serve no purpose. Please explain. The goal of this thread was to educate people like me to understand the class better.
---
I read almost everywhere that regrowth is very situational and mana inefficient (forget Vael fight).
---
I watched a bunch of FPVOD and saw druids casting rejuv very often. So they were wrong in doing so?
---
Avoid statements like this is trash or other general, uninformative statements. The goal is to give accurate information with reasoning behind it. Not just to be “right” (rejuv might be trash, I have no idea haha, tell me why!)
---
Thx
---
That's exactly why it is censored!
---
Yea, it somewhat nerfs your advantage although you can still use cat form outside and talent that for 30%? from level 20/1, so there's still an advantage.
---
Just broadly that running until 40 was tiresome after a while. Especially on your 4th character. 
---
The current level 20 (or even 1 with the heirloom mount) is too low though. 30 was a nice compromise
---
Hmmm I see. That makes sense, in the meters examples i’ve seen, there was always one Druid way ahead of the others in terms of healing done.
---
I wasnt aware this is how it works I assumed it was an account wide thing to help out people that dont play often, thanks for the info i was wondering if i make a warrior or priest but ill just go with both!
---
you never know if a small bio will evolve into a big bio. And big bio sometimes takes 5-10 minutes depending on how well i've eaten the day before.
---
Perhaps, then, druid might interest you? They're also pretty good at tanking, actually, and with some skill, gear, and consumables, you can tank pretty much every boss up to and including KT in naxx. 
---
Obviously they're still healers normally, but they give the same versatility as paladins, if not more, really.
---
Someone made a thread about this less than 24 hours ago.
---
We also have an explicit patch note entry.
---
2.0.3
---
* The title "Scarab Lord" can now be chosen in game for select players.
---
I think it's wrong to say it isnt for hardcore players, imo it's just a different kind of hardcore. No you dont need to be a perfect dps, tank or healer, you wont wipe because the dps missed one button of their rotation and so on. But you needed to put in a hardcore effort before the raid with gear, consumeables, during the raid with respawning trashmobs, no reset on Bloodlust and other CDs each wipe and you had to work together 40 man and actually keep a good spirit.
---
Classic was hardcore in so many other ways, keeping a roster that could have 40 man raid was hardcore enough, you had to sit through horrible groups and deal with having a shitty time in LBRS or whatever, you couldnt just leave because that reputation would follow you.
---
Retail is for the hardcore people who dosent give one flying fuck about being social and other people, who just wants to have the max action and being challenged every second of a bossfight.
---
Classic is for the hardcore people, who can handle a hard time and care about helping yourself by helping others, grinding the most boring shit ever, just so you can go and kill that dragon that would drop 2 loots for 40 people.
---
&gt; Yeah, but getting into those levels quickly and efficiently will be the difference between being in the bulk pack or not. 
---
I agree that you are correct, in principle, but my point is about scale. If you take an inefficient route 1-12 and waste 15 minutes, that is a trivial handicap to overcome.
---
The people who will separate themselves from the bulk of the pack will be playing 20+ hours the first two days regardless of the optimization of their leveling path. That's literally going to be about 2% of the playerbase, at best.
---
No, I agree it's for all players. By "hardcore" I'm referencing the players who are so focused on endgame and achieving maximum level in the shortest amount of time that they dismiss the journey getting there. In turn, that creates a group of unhappy players at the top who will argue/are arguing for content beyond vanilla. 
---
I'm in a strange position, because I really enjoyed TBC and even WoTLK, but I also recognize that those expansions, coupled with other changes like dungeon finder, undermined a lot of the original game's concepts.
---
I wouldn't be against expansions if I knew they would stay true to the original game.
---
And you have zero evidence of this?
---
haha dude i swear i check mmo champ every day like 3 times and these last few weeks every time i would actually see news my heart would nearly explode
---
who needs drugs at this point
---
It would be fun if someone could recognize any of the names in the chat though :p
---
PvP as an enhancement shaman was so much fun though. Especially against clothies.
---
There's always that one elitist guild on every server bum rushing to the top!
---
I'm also a horde prot/ret paladin since TBC, but I decided to go alliance to see the other side for once and with the intent of playing a paladin still, but after research and playing on a pserver, I settled on priest instead. I wanted to make it work, but ret just doesn't seem fun or viable and a struggle to gear to be still below average. And I just don't want the responsibility of tanking anymore. Was a resto druid in classic originally and want to go back to healing.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Without considering professions, what options would a fresh 60 hunter have for farming gold?
---
Everything about the game feels like you earned it more. I don’t want an easy mode game.
---
No. BEGONE SATAN!
---
Reddit is full of the softest most butthurt community on the internet. I feel sorry for all you pussies when you graduate from high school and realize the world doesnt coddle you like your parents and teachers did. GET OVER IT! THE WORLD IS FULL OF THINGS THAT WILL MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE OR CHALLENGE YOUR PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS. God im happy i don't have to raise kids in this shit ass world.
---
Yarp!
---
I've been doing a trial run on a private server. Took me about ten hours to ding lvl 10.
---
I'm going for endgame raiding. I want tgat bloodfang armor. It's going to be a bitch, it's going to take forever...and im going to relish every minute of the ride.
---
ever think about just saying "no summon, sorry just come quick" and makeing them run. you have that option you know
---
I really think it depends on which server you're on. The bigger ones tend to be more toxic in my experience. Smaller ones have better communities. YMMV.
---
I think once Classic hits it'll be more relaxed since there's a lot of people who'll be coming back for the first time. You're still going to encounter toxic people no matter and that was the same in vanilla too.
---
Same boat. I'm hoping to find a new guild and friends to play with.
---
Did you read your own link? It's a discussion with random opinions thrown in that ended on 'it was added in 2.0.3' with a concession by Peter.
---
Anything
---
Yeah, I think I could have defined the group I'm referring to a little better.
---
Make sure it's nice and sharp for more efficient processing of the gnome meat. :D
---
It certainly helps build a sense of identity!
---
Higher resolutions? Yeah okay, fair enough. 
---
But updating vanilla with all the new models and textures??? Its not vanilla anymore.
---
I'm going to write a piece of classical music... But I'm gonna use heavy metal tone electric guitars, the drums are gonna have a double bass pedal, and I'm gonna replace the conductor with a screaming emo....
---
See my point?
---
This is all from an almost completely Alliance perspective;I remember Gnomer being difficult purely because of its length, however somehow ST jumps out to me as being mechanically just really challenging, but also SUPER fun
---
Awesome looking, I was doing something similar manually so far :D 
---
After being in charge of the guild bank for a lot of time once it was added to Warcraft, and being one of the authors of one of the core proposals that guild banks in WoW were based on, I can only say that the main issue of guild bank in classic is hard to solve...
---
\- Showing up what is inside is great, and this addon will help out many, since last option for such thing was to use addon to export contents into BBCode to paste to your PHPBB forum, which many guilds will not use once Classic is released again
---
\- The problem for guild bank is if you want full transparency you need to have a tool to show all logs  
---
\- - What came to guild bank is easy  
---
\- - What you sent out from guild bank still needs to be done manually  
---
\- - Logging mail costs and AH fees for stuff you plan to sell is mind-numbing, you can just log how much income you got after you sold stuff, but then again not everything gets sold... And that part is really hard.
---
As a dwarf Hunter. Should I just head to westfall for a carrion bird? Any serpents that are worth grabbing along the way (under level 20)
---
Hunters are good in MC and alright in BWL. Then they start to stagnate while other classes continue to get better, until in the end of vanilla a hunter does like 60-70% of the DPS that a rogue does.
---
The problem is - a lot of old stuff doesn't have better textures or meshes. Even so vanilla itself does look good on 4K or ultrawide displays. It's not that old 720p compressed quality.
---
I am talking about Vael, which is where you quoted me intitally from.
---
In practice they are just healers in vanilla, why pretend otherwise?
---
I concur.
---
As an added bonus of being 1 of at most of 4 druids, is that you tend to get geared quickly compared to say warriors.
---
Uldaman really surprised groups with the end boss. If you couldn't DPS him down fast, you were screwed.
---
Kronos 3 has queue anywhere BGs, all the camping he is citing form that experience on K3 is part of that p servers implementation of pvp.
---
People not following the rules?! OMFG! They must be savage rapists or murderers! Please escort this person to their safe place,  they cant be around people who break rules!
---
Gnomer and ST are definitely the most maze-like. The alarm bots in Gnomer, the accidental train pulls, man, I can't wait to wipe there.
---
I remember druids being very hard to 1v1 because they can disengage, travel form, stealth, and reset until the sun goes down (but they’re not particularly deadly). 
---
Rogue and shadow priest are deadly if they get the jump on someone. They can pretty much lock down a kill before you have a chance to react or counter.  
---
Hunters were good against melee if they had room to kite and run without pulling 100 mobs on them and getting dazed.
---
If you want BGs in Phase 2 instead of 3 for what OP is talking about. Then you should 100% roll on a PVE server. OPs suggestion ruins the spirit of open world pvp.
---
That simply isnt the case.
---
A lot of those players have experienced the journey many times over and it's not fun for them to take their time and level. So what they enjoy is to rush to the content they.. enjoy. Hope this makes sense. Like I'll def be rushing 60, and doing all that stuff. Because I've done the journey 3 times in actual vanilla (2x rogues, 1x paladin), and a couple more times on pservers (druid, priest, warlock). I'd rather get 60, get gear, and start doing the content I enjoy, like pvping.
---
Princess Theradras runs in Maraudon. Kill Tinkerer Gizlock, Princess Theradras then the croc boss.
---
No. Go play on a pve server if you dont want open world pvp
---
Ravager WF bby
---
You forgot they should be level 1 Gnomes
---
Stormwind has the ships
---
Aaaaaand not go to work when the alarm goes off
---
No serious guild should have more then 3 Hunters tho, 2 is optimal in the later tiers
---
***Sunken Temple*** definitely was the hardest because of the constant 4 elites packs (who are difficult to CC without a specific group makeup because they're Undead/Elemental/Dragonkin), and it was a maze. Plus the first mobs were level 46-47, while the last boss was 55 and hit like a tank, which often caused playrs to be underleveled for it.
---
However, of all Vanilla leveling dungeons I wiped the most *by far* on that **goddamn spawnable Murloc final boss in WC*****,*** even though I don't remember ever wiping on any other part of WC. The fight starts with 3 elite spawns who get on your tank in 2 seconds from different directions, then, like 40 seconds later, 3 almost non CCable ooze mobs arrive, then 3 non elite ooze adds 10 seconds later, and then finally the boss spawns after some additional 40 other seconds or so. And you have to deal with all of that while protecting a casting NPC. If you don't have a mage with frost nova this pull is just undoable unless your group outlevels the dungeon. Horrible.
---
It wouldn't be that hard on a higher level, but most classes simply do not have the tools to deal with such pulls in the 18-24 level range.
---
What racism? Where have I made racist comments?
---
I like the memes of CA because they attack the cancerous retardation that is progressivism.
---
&gt; persecution complex and some really strange double standards
---
Where did I allude to me being persecuted? I'm doing just fine, maybe don't talk for people you quite literally know less than nothing about (All your assumptions are false.)
---
You couldn't attack them in vanilla. Blizzard retroactively enabled them when they released the training dummies in wrath.
---
We had a feral for the rogue/warrior group after the Druid patch. Me as the SPriest for our lock group. 
---
Good times.
---
I plan on helping anyone thats needs it.
---
Never had problems as a resto druid outside the 30 min cooldown rez issue when I was the only one in group who could rez at all. Though looking back the stress of knowing I couldn't rez probably made me a better healer.
---
No that doesn’t make sense
---
Blizzard is a business, their goal is to make profit.
---
A business would not be petty enough to lose money.
---
Furthermore why would blizzard do that knowing that their value in stocks and reputation would decrease.
---
It would seriously negatively impact the company.
---
I’m not sure how old you are but this is how companies work, in a very broad sense.
---
Know that companies goals is to not lose money period.
---
I just realized that I've spent much more of my life reading about how much people hate being camped than I have spent being camped. It's such an overblown issue.
---
Same here! I keep posting her links from this sub while at work, and she keeps answering with crying smilies because there is no release date and that makes us sad. :'(
---
Seems hes in EPL
---
I really need to learn to search :(
---
It's vanilla, toxicity is to be expected. When it comes to the community, you can't go any lower than that. Private servers reflect the reality of the matter, sadly.
---
No you're just being pedantic.
---
Okay grp so we just jump down to this cog here and... there goes the hunter pet... we're all going to die
---
So I wouldn't mind new textures but don't touch the models
---
That's a really got point il just be happy with the high resolutions
---
I am fine if Blizzard adds the option to have updated graphics (I prefer the old graphics) but it would be better if they didn't waste their time on that at all imho
---
The graphics (for the most part) have stood the test of time.
---
How to beat mages:
---
-	Pop recklessness
---
-	Use free action potion
---
-	Kill mage instantly
---
-	Challenge a warlock to a duel before mage has a chance to attempt a rematch
---
-	Repeat 30 minutes later
---
The thing about 'bad players' is they tend to be assholes. 
---
If a person is open to learning, they aren't a bad player for long.
---
Healer is fun in pvp as well if you play with people :D
---
You gotta realize there's a difference between the newbie, the one who's still learning/honing his skills and the deliberately bad player who doesn't give two fucks about getting better and just ruins the fun of the entire party.
---
There are those who just don't care about the others and are often the ones getting reprimanded over and over again and then they come crying here "the classic player base is toxic".
---
No, we're not toxic, but if you fuck up over and over again and don't listen to what your party members say, you're in for a rough treatment.
---
If this sentiment is shared by the community at large come classic, there will be a lot of disappointed players
---
Both classes are extremely useful, just not as something beside healing. You need insane effort to make either class be "maybe okay" at anything but healing in any comparable capacity to other classes
---
But people are ofc free to play as they want, I just think they're setting themselves up for disappointment if they pick healer classes and try to do something else with them
---
Vanilla class design was a lot of good intentions and dreams, and while vanilla is a lot of fun, it pays off to adhere to lessons learned over the last one and a half decade
---
they do actually
---
Alright I’ll bring my epic mount top
---
Whoever says that it doesn’t matter whether expansions are released as long as it’s done in different servers or whatever did not go through the launch of the original expansions and is not seeing the complete picture.
---
When TBC launched I had no intentions of upgrading. I only did so because in just 2 weeks, there were no more people to raid with and no more BGs. Understand that every time there is a expansion, the population suffers greatly from it. Its the difference between waiting 7-10 minutes in queue for a very balanced BG, and 40-50+ minutes to play with 50% of the same players you see every time. 
---
The world became deserted. There were few people in the major cities. People had moved on. Now, I’ve no doubt less people would jump in this time around, but if expansion are released, than the game population will suffer greatly each time.
---
I'm very much "no rushing", taking it slow and enjoying the game for a long time. I've even created a guild for that. :)
---
However I still want them to release the expansions eventually, at least TBC and Wrath.
---
The emphasis on "eventually". After at least two years but likely more than than that. My goals are enjoying the game until we have done all PvE content. It'll take a long time but after that I'll be just as eager to play TBC and after that Wrath.
---
Hey, what was your character's name?
---
I love talking to trees man - Druids
---
So hindsight is always 20/20, but it is possible that my memory is foggy. That being said, what I try to do is find any old reference material that can refresh my mind. Oldest reference I could at work is this article on how far resto druid has come from vanilla to cata
---
 http://www.restokin.com/2010/09/the-history-of-resto-druids/
---
It's not much, but it supports my memory
---
There’s always a good one every now and then. Zhevra hooves gave me a good chuckle
---
I’m actually rolling shaman because I want to heal n totems, I like feeling helpful haha.
---
Gonna do wpvp though too so it should be fun with the other stuff shaman do.
---
Fear the rainbow
---
I personally feel heavily right clicked, by all these enhance shamans.
---
Are they going to offer PVE servers or it will all  be PVP ?
---
&gt;Classic WoW is for players who are there for the journey, to socialize with old and new friends, to revel in big accomplishments and small ones alike, to appreciate the details of an amazingly crafted world. I personally loved the pace of the game and the work you needed to put in to get anywhere. I would wager the majority of people who play classic are playing to relive these experiences, not to rush through them.
---
Incorrect. Classic is for whoever the fuck wants to play it.
---
More like a good 70% but yeah I get your point
---
So should I opt for cloth if I go elemental or dps if the stats are better?
---
TBC pls Blissard
---
Kidding of course. I am just very excited for summer :)
---
No joke. A geared sprst is a monster in pvp.
---
Dont paladins have the highest output in BiS?
---
Resistance 101: 315 is cap
---
Fire resistance for tanks:
---
* Total of or as close as possible to 315 for Ragnaros/Firemaw: 60 from totem or aura, 15 from Juju Ember so you need up to 240 from gear
---
* For Barron Geddon tanks could use less than 315 total, using some good tanking or threat pieces instead
---
* For Vael, initially you want as close as possible to 315 total, but as guild progresses you will use less and less to increase threat and allow better dps output
---
* Melee need 200+ to be able to "cheat" flame buffet on Firemaw which is also a little advanced tactic
---
Important:
---
* Spellbinders from UBRS entrance give +83 FR buff which is close and convenient for both MC and BWL
---
* Magic resistance potions (+50) and druid buff does not stack with totem / aura resistance (but good to have if you don't have them in party)
---
Nature resistance:
---
* 315 total (255 from gear) is required for 15 melee soakers on Huhuran (can go with less once your guild understands the fight)
---
* Good NR while keeping 8% hit is recommended for melee on Viscidous
---
* Honorable mentions: Tank on Kri / Ouro can use some NR while not sacrificing survivability
---
* Hunter pulling C'Thun can use maximum NR to soak first two beams
---
Shadow resistance:
---
* Two warlocks with high shadow resistance (200+) are required for tanking Twin Emperors
---
Above is a "must", everything else can be covered with Greater protection potions
---
My birthday is Feb 15.
---
Seems overwhelmingly likely that they will release it at the same time as 8.2 which will probably release between June 28 and July 2nd to coincide with the release of the nee FF14 expansion.
---
Agree. 
---
During WoD I could literally solo hogger on a level 1 monk
---
solo'd deadmines on a level 11 hunter
---
dying in retail takes more effort than surviving in classic
---
Yeah, I remember this happening to me using Zygor
---
I love the hidden shaman coves with the elementals. I don't know if the Horde ones are still in the game, but you can still find the Draenei's four spots on Azuremyst and Bloodmyst. My favorite is the wind one - there's a small path behind exodar that takes you to the top of the mountain. Had no idea it existed until I stumbled upon it this year.
---
Maybe only if you're going for world firsts. 40 people is a lot to put together and most guilds would probably be happy to have someone not standing in the fire.
---
I think we just found the lazy bastard guys
---
I'm guessing this was your reason haha. You couldn't even use health pots, and popping out was death. Maybe that's one reason no one wanted us to tank 😂
---
I'd rather have an empty spot than a ret paladin
---
I believe there are owls in the beginning dwarf areas
---
I find the probability high that it will be released on A Tuesday..
---
Imo that's really missing the point.  Sure, anyone can play it, but it seems to me the intent is to bring it back for players who want to have those old experiences again.
---
I'm stating that players should not go into classic to rush the content and expect expansions which ultimately undermine the game's original experience.
---
Yeah I was messing with the name filter to see if it was different. Looks to be the same as Modern WoW.
---
&gt;You need insane effort to make either class be "maybe okay"
---
This is partially my point but i disagree with "maybe okay"
---
Early days of raiding i entirely agree. There's no reason to have a ret pally or an elemental shaman in molten core during progression but when the raid is on farm or its a few content cycles behind it would be perfectly acceptable to let a geared shaman or paladin dps. Ive seen well geared paladins and shamans near the top of the dps chart on some encounters. Is it difficult? Yes. Does it take a lot of time investment? Yes. But there is no reason to discourage the dedicated. 
---
At the end of the day if you dont perform you wont keep your spot. Paladins and shamans should expect to heal for a long time before theyll be able to dps or tank but its not impossible.
---
You should level as BM. It's really by far the best spec to level with. It's very good for pvp aswell, huge power spikes being lvl 30 pet stun and level 40 pet enrage
---
I’m mad that this isn’t out of the realm of possibility for Blizzard.
---
315 is cap, every point will help you resist more often and with a higher chance for a higher amount.  
---
So there is several strategies that works depending on a lot of things, what people often forget is that you dont always have a optimal raid group put together, healers might be lacking or there is too few ranged dps compared to melee. Generally you are going to be favoring dps &gt; resistance and more commonly healing/mp5 &gt; resistance, on tanks it depends more on the fight and what issues flare up from the first tries.   
---
Back when classes had no reworks, spellpower was rare, spellhit non existent and consumables on the lower end you have a very limited potential dps and hps, especially considering healers mana, meaning keeping the raid alive during ragnaros 2 phases becomes a bigger problem as you obviously cant get him down before the first submerge. But when factoring in the some 80 resistance from the blackrock spire mindcontroll you in the end are most likely going to be wanting more dps and therefore very low fire resistance on your ranged dps on ragnaros, as a second submerge is a far greater problem. In the situations where a dps can get a few points of fire resistance with a very little dps loss its usually worth it, especially if you are melee as they are always close to lava and will therefore always be hit by one of ragnaros aoe, thats about the only dmg they will take. Tanks are capping their fire resistance as you want to resist as many knockups as possible since a single knockup can potentially kill several dps and making ragnaros submerge. You are also potentially overstacked or understacked on healers meaning its all a balance game that usually favors more dps &gt;more fire resistance. So 315 fire resistance for the tank, mostly to avoid the knockup (that kills melee quicker that flies) and what fire resistance mostly the melee dps can get together without loosing too much dps, ranged dps and healers are the same but too a lesser extent.   
---
On Vael it switches up a bit, as the dragon does more then 100% fire damage, and threat is a major problem on vael compared to ragnaros (On ragnaros ranged cant get aggro before melee and melee are running in and out of his aoe knockback). But the rules are generally the same that a few fire resistance points aslong as you are not loosing too much dps, if threat is a problem for the raid the tank will switch some pieces out for more threat  
---
The next resistance fight is nature resistance with Huhuran in AQ40, then the optional boss Viscidous, Huhuran needs a poison wall (tanks, melee and usually hunters) of 15 people and viscidous has a trick to him that you can avoid the high nature dmg on most of the raid, making nature resistance redundant.  
---
Then in aq40 shadow resistance can be used to tank one of the emperors, a warlock is usually selected for this. There are ways of avoiding having a resistance tank here and a stamina stacking warrior can deal with it.   
---
After this Sapphiron is the next with frost resistance, here healers are going to be stacking more frost resistance then ever before, making it the most resistance gear taxing encounter there is.   
---
A few of the world bosses needs resistance on the tank I want to remember its the dragon in duskwood as you want to resist as many as the dots as possible so you dont have to switch tanks. You can also deal with ebonrocs debuff with a high amount of shadow resistance but that is far from a requirement as he is considered perhaps one of the easiest bosses in the game.
---
Did he stand in the cleave? Cause if he didn’t stand in the cleave, it’s not the same guy.
---
Are you intentionally misreading the point or are you just a moron? Either way, eat a dick.
---
I'm all on board for an optional--key word here--graphical update. It would be a lot of extra work, though, and probably more money and a bigger team than they want to put in charge of Classic right now.
---
With all of the advancements in image upscaling lately, like ESRGAN, I would like to see the vanilla textures upscaled for sure to reduce pixellation and blurriness. It would be the same textures, just crisper. I'd also like to see some poly count increases to some of the models.
---
1.12 looks pretty good out of the box, though, and cleans up especially nice with a basic Reshade profile.
---
For those interested,  [https://imgur.com/a/jIdjo](https://imgur.com/a/jIdjo) I took of 1.12.1 with WoD/Legion models, and Legion tilesets recolored to match vanilla colors.
---
And here is 1.12.1 with nothing more than a custom ReShade profile.
---
To get atiesh , you need :
---
- shitload of time. Naxx is not for everyone.
---
- a hardcore guild that will remain for 2 to 3 years at least. The guild might disband before.
---
- You also must be in the top guild of the server.
---
- Atiesh goes to the raid leader, an officer or someone that is really important in the guild (not an average farmer. A decision maker, a key figure of the guild) Work for that 
---
Good luck if you think you can fulfill all this
---
Which I love, because it's so much broader than just "need to pee." Are you peeing? Going to take a shit? Eating? Giving birth? Molting? Nobody knows!
---
Is that you Dirtylarry?!
---
Personally, I love leveling as BM at least at 40. Your pet will legit solo any enemy player, and if it is two clothies it will take them both.
---
Talentable CC if you really care that much about it and in short dungeon boss fights are where rets shine hell make it a dungeon with undead or demons and its all gravy.
---
Yes, but they were drastically reduced.
---
That's not common that a rare button
---
crabs??? /r/2007scape must be lurking here....
---
Transmog killed world of warcraft for me.
---
There is something about being able to see other people's gear without having to inspect them or when  you go into a battleground and you can immediately tell who to stay the fuck away from and who to pick on lol. Tired of seeing people using pitchforks and farmer gear in battlegrounds. Just got killed by someone wearing a farmer's hat and pitchfork, cool...
---
Yea, it's the same. You can't pull more than 1 mob at a time without your long cooldowns as arm however it's still a lot faster than leveling as prot.
---
I like Bows
---
I think you're missing the point if you think your way is somehow the right way to play a game
---
We got a "blue post" but it was an April fools day joke.
---
i second what people are saying here (it doesn't take too long to reach max loyalty and rarely feed them) and also want to add that for me at least, i pretty much never had to buy food to feed my pet, as meat drops from quest mobs were more than enough for cats. YMMV, but it does get better
---
They are not only good. Every melee in the game will worship you.
---
Same, except I wonder which class I should main.
---
Gnome meat isn't kosher.
---
The PVP rewards were not THIS good in that phase of vanilla... THAT is the point here. We want Vanilla, but not with an ENTIRELY different priority on gearing.
---
That is a game changing difference.
---
My original experience was figuring out how to get to end game as fast as possible and get to the fun stuff as fast as possible. Was that not MY original experience, and should I not be allowed to relive that?
---
Lucky you finding the exact number of excellent mages, warlocks, rogues and warriors. In the real world, if you can find five excellent hunters that show on time, every time with every consumable. You bring five hunters. If you can only find three, you bring three. If you can only find mediocre hunters, you bring 2.
---
Good luck fighting for world bosses with 2 hunters.
---
You may like it. Goldshire makes it worth it almost. I main a zandalari mage.
---
Then the game needs to make crafting the end-game. If you can craft sets that don't look like garbage, then there would be no issue and everyone would essentially know the gear power, wealth, skill, etc. of other players.
---
Thank you for coming in with numbers.
---
For HPS probably.
---
You totally can, but don't have expectations of additional content once you've burned through it.
---
Perfect 10/10
---
It's not the right way. But like I said, the devs shouldn't have to publish expansions for those people who do rush through the content.
---
Why the hell would I have those expectations? They weren't in Vanilla, and I'm here to play Vanilla.
---
As of 1.12 there is only really one unique pet to go for. Broken tooth with an attack speed of 1.0. But Swamp jaguars in the swamp of sorrows have an attack speed of 1.2. So it's a min/max thing. The issue in pre 1.9 patch private server is that Lupos is not a matter of min/max. Lupos is not a few % better than every other pets, it's outright broken compared to other pets.
---
All other pets are quite common. The only annoying one to get is the wolf at the end of LBRS for max rank bite and ferocious howl.
---
Then we are on the same page my man!
---
50% ret paladins
---
50% enh shamans
---
Let the meme wars begin
---
If people continue to bail out on retail WoW the way they are now it seems extremely likely that Blizzard will release progression servers or Classic style servers for TBC and Wrath.
---
Which frankly would be amazing as Classic and the two expansions that were developed prior to the Activision merger in 2008 were some of the best MMOs ever. You can definitely see the cracks start to show by the end of Wrath with multiple difficulties and the duty finder coming in but by and large those 3 games together constitute the best most rewarding mmo experience to date for most players.
---
There he go there he go.
---
Thanks I started listening to the podcast yesterday and it's really good.
---
Two IMPORTANT things to always remember
---
We were all noobs once
---
And we are all human now
---
As far as i know, the proc is unique and will not stack. More hunters with the bonus will simply increase the frequency of proc. I could be wrong however. Certainly requires testing on the actual Blizzard classic client.
---
Grinding is great. Get in the zone and just do it. Lil performance enhancing drugs and do it. Fucking give me handout pussies these days.
---
Spoiler: it’s Osconty. On a different server.
---
An excellent hunter will manage to keep the pet alive. One of the aspects differing the truly great hunters, from the good hunters. The ability to keep the pet alive, and still deal damage. It can be quite tricky, and i look forward to it. Especially since pet pathing is almost certainly 90% custom on private servers. Maybe it's easier, maybe it's harder on classic.
---
On live, I always wanted to see someone organize a conga line of death knights all the way from like Booty Bay to Scarlet Monastery, then just abduct people by chain death gripping them from one end of the continent to the other. It would certainly be a fast way to cover that much ground.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7escqx/what_class_are_you_gonna_be_playing_in_vanilla/
---
In vanilla there were six Black Lotus areas that shared nodes. Of those nodes, one would spawn every hour. On cooldown this meant a server would spawn 1,008 Black Lotuses per week. 
---
For actual Blizzlike populations, which no private server has because of the nature of being a single server with an international population as opposed to everyone playing from the same time zone +- 1-3 hours, this is actually an over abundance. Even on vanilla servers that had 8+ guilds progressing in Naxx, like Magtheridon EU (a server so congested in Naxx that they had to schedule Thaddius attempts between guilds because if two guilds did it at the same time it lagged the entire instance server and guaranteed a wipe for both guilds) Flasks (not Lotus, Flasks) sold on the AH for about 80-100g. On a medium or low pop server they were even cheaper and were basically always available. It is true that low tier guilds didn't Flask or only Flasked the tank, but I really don't see a reason for that to change. Top tier guilds didn't use Flasks seriously until AQ40 either, when the content got hard enough to justify them. That means we'll have months of farming Black Lotus and not actually needing to use them. I predict organized guilds will have literally thousands banked by the time AQ40 rolls around. 
---
This makes zero difference for hybrids tho, people who care about optimal will ignore the hybrids that suck regardless and guilds that don't care will continue not to care. The rumors around Black Lotus spawns are just so ridiculous.
---
And why do you get to decide what the dev's should or shouldn't do?
---
Damn! Haha, I really wasn't thinking when I wrote that. Thanks! I'm keeping it in just for the *lols* and not editing it out.
---
We three-manned our way through all the instances and we had to get Creative on the some bosses. There was simply no way for us to do enough damage for the last phase of Archadaes, we were getting swarmed and killed. We realised that if we let all the small statues spawn before enterinc the last phase our healer could keep the tank up and we could wittle down the large adds. I remember how happy we were when we came up with it and it worked.
---
TBC - The Burning Classic?
---
I think the new Cataclysm zones were good, just very different from what was in Vanilla, so the game shifted quite a bit. Some zones (Like Azshara) which were neglected in Vanilla were completely redone, which gave them new life. However, a lot of them had phasing, and they were very linear, and plots were very well contained which made it easier to get questing done but took away some of the immersive aspects that Vanilla did so well (like all the multi-zone quests). The zones were also much easier and generally you had outleveled them well before you had finished the story in each zine.
---
I'd rather cancel Classic than have a ret paladin in the raid.
---
So basically, if i'm not planning to sweat my balls out, i should do just fine with one of those swamp jaguars ? Broken tooth probably not worth the time investment for non min/maxers.
---
They are absolutely necessary. 
---
Fear removal, Windfury and other dps boosts, elemental resistances you name it.
---
Classes are really unique in Classic, so there are no sub-obtimal classes. Warlocks do less dps than mages, but they can summon people. Hunters do poor dps but are absolutely necessary for tranq shot for example.
---
Druids aren't really the best at anything, but they are the only class with a battle rez. List goes on.
---
Shamans are great dude, you should definitely play one if you want to.
---
I can't think of names but there have been map mods that did this. Some worked better than others. I don't know if they had them back in vanilla, but they were definitely a thing in later expansions. Assuming we get a more modern, up to date API, there will almost certainly be at least one for classic.
---
I really enjoyed WoTLK and TBC. The issue I have with expansions is they trivialize the original content and split the playerbase, among other incidental changes like hamstringing world PVP.
---
So shaman at max isn’t fun? I wanna level one in classic, but should I reconsider?
---
I love this meme lol
---
Well, you can play retail until level 20 to at least learn how to move, how to keybind, how to mouse turn etc
---
And aldo to have a glimpse of what the different classes can do, tho they are drastically capped in retail IMO.
---
But if you have zero experience and don't want to be a baddie, then yes, I'd recommend to at least play the free part of retail wow so you at least know what the binds do, how mob movement works etc...
---
That's why you wait until BG's get released to level those alts.
---
I can't, in good conscience, recommend complete inaction to another gamer that is trying to do their research.  I don't think that's fair advice based on your request.  However, I can't tell based on your post, if you are completely new to WOW *only* or if you are completely new to *all MMORPGs*.
---
If you are completely and utterly new to all MMORPGs period, you should definitely follow the majority advice here: Just wait for actual launch and you are in for a real treat as long as you end up enjoying the genre as a whole.  However, it might behoove you to play a bit on a free trial from retail or even better some other MMO just to get an idea of how you as a player interact with an MMO and what the genre is about.
---
If you are a seasoned MMO veteran that just never played any version of WoW....I'd say trying out a pserver is probably a pretty good idea just to poke around and see if this version of WoW and style of MMO is for you.   I would say that if you do this, try to decide which faction you want to play for actual Classic, and then toy around on the other faction on the pserv so you still go in fresh on Classic release.
---
 No, I'm in this because I LOOOVE animals, stupid.              
---
         
---
Even Boomkin?          
---
           
---
Of course. Boomkin is a viable spec.                
---
               
---
So would you play a Boomkin?           
---
              
---
What is your damage, little boy. You have a sick and twisted worldview.              
---
No, you're misunderstaning me, Prince Valiant. I'm saying if you were a Druid, would you play a Boomkin, if you were another Druid?         
---
       
---
Well, in that case, you bet your sweet ass I would.          
---
          
---
Thought so.
---
Yo, this motherfucker ain't one of us. He said he'd fucking play Balance!
---
***you have been removed from the group***
---
Totally my opinions. They can do what they want.
---
or org zeppelin tower, seems this is from wrath ye
---
January 17th here
---
I think part of it has to do with what we're used to today. The grocery stores we think of as boring might seem incredibly exotic in a hundred years.
---
But I get what you mean. If I had to describe it, it would be "functional design" or "efficient design" - things are designed to fill a purpose and be easy to construct, but sacrifice artistic value and personal vision. In terms of games it's mainly seen with clones, such as the western realistic shooter and more recently, the battle royale. Someone cracked a combo that will sell decently, and instead of taking risks by being inventive, people churn out the same thing over and over. Another term might be consumerism, where there has become a bigger focus on quantity over quality.
---
Vanilla wasn’t designed so players would knock out a whole zone in a few hours and then move on to the next like has been expected since Outland. The design team then expected you to be travelling all around the world, doing a few quests then heading back again to the same zone 2 or 3 times. See STV for example. You usually leave the zone and come back for a whole new round of quests — either new ones or later parts of chains — 3 or 4 times. 
---
This seems consistent with what you said but not OP. I don’t think he explored enough because barrens definitely has enough quests.
---
Hunter in the Robe of Arugal.  What could go wrong?
---
Wotlk map :O, also shows the DK starting area.
---
Arms warriors pull two mobs for Sweeping Strikes and Cleave combos. It is much more efficient that way.
---

---
higher res version of the early vanilla map with all those flightpath and region names
---
Warlocks suck man go hunter or Druid
---
Players drop badges? You can turn those badges in?
---
That’s what you’re expected to do. Leave the zone and quest somewhere else and then come back.
---
They go to warriors that have a way worse sword/mace or to hunters of course :)
---
Its not really a great weapon for raiding. Sure it does more damage than OEB or Spinal Reaper or Bonereavers but it puts up a dot, and begins to be eclipsed by end of BWL loot. 
---
Your 1 enhance/ret should have nightfall ASAP anyhow. 
---
I see it as a pure pvp weapon. Its obviously great for all three. But Warriors have access to Maces, Swords and Axes. Sham only Axes and Maces. That being the case, sham should be higher priority on 2h pvp maces/axes.
---
But id only think that way if i had a tight raid team i knew wouldnt quit during the entire content cycle. If I had doubts, then it becomes a whole lot more about what I think of the reliability of the individual.
---
drop totems + chain heal...
---
I think what he's saying is that it will be harder to get gear as a rogue or a warrior since more people roll as those classes. Whereas it would be easier to get gear as a druid since it's usually the least played class.
---
Is there more like this
---
Cata made the leveling experience quite a bit better, imo....or at least more streamlined and easier to keep up with the story.  The zones also got visual upgrades, and some got changed quite a bit.
---
Its a bit of a double edged sword, though.  There were some iconic places that got taken out/destroyed, and while it was pretty neat at first, it sucks that we cant go back and visit them on retail.
---
Im sure on classic there will be some things that i really miss from the post-cata world, but man am i looking forward to seeing those old zones again.  Maybe its largely nostalgia/the fact that i only got to experience them for about a year and a half before cata dropped, but seeing original Darkshore, Thousand Needles, The Plaguelands, Loch Modan, etc are going to be really nice.
---
Hell, even Westfall without the stupid tornadoes and whatever will be nice again.
---
Theres some really fun/quirky/funny/whatever quests that were added with the Cata revamp (punching a dragon in the face), and i really enjoyed doing them...especially at first, but some of them may have been a bit...over the top, i guess.
---
I guess the tl;dr would be: It was probably a necessary change at the time, though perhaps a bit overdone.
---
Private servers and Resident Evil 2 are holding me over nicely for now.
---
And adult responsibilities.
---
I didn't think chain heal was a smart heal until tbc? It also is prohibitively expensive to spam...
---
And that's why such target should give exactly zero honor points. For sake of player retention.
---
People would still kill them 'for fun' but not for 'farming honor'.
---
And my experience was from a private server, so there's no telling if the mechanic worked properly.
---
All good and valid points, beyond the issue of splitting the player base though all of these are solved by having servers that are time locked to a particular expansion.
---
That way people can explore the meaningful versions of the game at their leisure.
---
Purge spam in AV.  Good times.
---
It's an iconic support class. People will love you for your totems and chain heal, you'll be a valued member of your raids. It's not flashy and you won't put up big dick dps numbers (you'll be expected to heal in pve) but you'll always have a spot in raids and you'll make everyone else stronger. It's up to you if that's what you're after
---
I thought it was already determined that they were updating the graphics, with the ability to toggle.
---
This meme is starting to make me lose any potential excitement about getting shoulders.
---
First time leveling to 60 on my priest i didn’t train a lot of stuff to save gold
---
Fast forward to my group in ST telling me to shackle the undead mobs and having to tell them I haven’t trained that
---
They were in at launch... 1.9 linked them between cities is all.
---
OwO
---
&gt; Why would we give a ~~druid~~ hunter weapon to a shaman? 
---
FTFY
---
Hahaha damn
---
I've watch people that have done and talked about naxx. I'm not saying it isn't hard, but it isn't has hard as people fantasize it being. I have the time, and dedication.
---
And the next line in the chat is the tank asking you to summon the slacker to start the instance as soon as posible.
---
Its not a matter of putting the slacker on point. Its the situation pushing you to summon him and forget about the incident.
---
You will face this situation A LOT and in the long term you will end up tired of it.
---
If you can type it, and it works, its allowed lol
---
&gt; Same with the Deathknight starting area, which is also on this map.
---
I legit thought I was losing my mind looking at this before reading your comment. I farmed Tyr's hand at least 2-3 times a week in vanilla and when I saw the map i was like, DA FUQ IS THAT?!
---
Not taking a dig at the map btw, it's fantastic, just had a bit of an internal crises thinking I didn't know the map as well as I thought I did.
---
"You're having fun wrong!"
---
That does sound good! I'll look into Vanilla druids a little more 
---
It's just so useful, especially when playing with time constraints, to just fill whatever is missing and get on with it.
---
6/9/420 here
---
Yeah! You could be the shadow embrace bot, or the vampiric touch bot, or the leader of the pack bot, or the bloodlust bot, or the moonkin aura bot...
---
Yeah but my shit spec will totally be viable :\^)
---
later...
---
Blizz enable LFR because nobody wants to play with me :(
---
According to [this guide](http://vanillawowhunter.com/vanilla-wow-pets/#owl), the only place to get owls before lvl 48 is Teldrassil.
---
Im looking forward to the grind where i can decide when i want to do it, i dont need to do a m+ every week and farm dailies and World q. I can farm when ever the fuck i want and I can do stack up and farm weeks in advance.
---
To be honest, I'm SUPER HAPPY that I am not like this.
---
I'll totally enjoy playing it. I'm certainly excited. But the degree of extreme NEED just doesn't exist within me anymore. And I consider that a good thing.
---
I'll just be happy once it's here and that'll be all.
---
Nice to hear from someone making the same choice! I never even considered the fact that plate won't always be an option for healer gear....
---
Warriors are the best 1v1 class if u include FAP and other pots
---
My last arugal fight on a pserver I kept getting MC'd. I just typed in chat 'jokes on you arugal, I've been oom for a while now!' He would just have me stand there until 5 second rule kicked in and then he'd cast a single smite.
---
I PM'd you :)
---
This is not higher res... but pretty cool with the flight points etc.
---
If you want to spend 8 hours a week grinding gnomergan, and get world buffs before every raid, sure.
---
The change is being pushed by BG PVPERS if you move BGs to Phase 2 in increases the camping (while players wait for queue pop) of flight paths and convenient zone entrances. The change does the opposite of what OP claims it will do.
---
\&gt; but it will help casual players and players that don't have a lot of free time. 
---
Ah, I also level 6 characters at once when I barely have time.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Alt? You mean my level 18 gnome rogue named toucher?
---
Is it usable while feared?
---
You right!
---
Will do
---
I never found ZF to be hard, certainly not ST hard.  It's one of my favorite dungeons after SM and Strat.   
---
There actually IS a method to cheese the Zombie boss, but it's not easy to pull off esp with pugs.  I've seen it pulled off properly exactly once.  It's essentially the exact same cheese as you can use on VC (and apparently Archaedus as I've learned in this thread).
---
dunno
---
How do you kill... that which has no life?
---
Was this a blue post some were I believe they said they where using a client used for BFA
---
5 stacks wont take out a raid boss, but it will crack some skulls.
---
Bajheera started in Cataclysm, not sure if that counts but if it does, he’s confirmed to be trying Classic
---
That beautiful man is the reason I made my warrior main back in THC.
---
That's really not my point of the post. It's more of an issue of "plz no expansions."
---
I think you have to be very specific about what you mean by 'hardcore', so much so that it's probably worth dropping that label to avoid confusion. It seems to me that you've got not issue with the way people play, but rather your problem is with those who would dictate to others how to approach the game instead. 
---
However I don't think the game should cater to min/max speed levellers and I don't think Blizzard think so either.
---
Yeah this is what I remember hearing, better stick to PVP if you want to have really fun as a spriest I guess
---
This post is referencing the view distance of enemy players and npcs, not "zoom out" distance. 99% sure the view distance referenced here is a serverside settings.
---
can you dont pls
---
Losing a BG will give you one badge and winning will give you three. You can turn in three badges from one bg for something like 30s i can't remember or three badges from all three BGS for a gold or two.
---
5-6 hours and at lvl 10 look at speedy Gonzalez over here!
---
You want a few to tranq.
---
If they keep putting out turds like Battle of Azeroth and Classic really takes a foothold they are going to look in the mirror and either fast track something like Classic TBC or throw up their hands and say "you know what? Fuck it, we are going to make alternative history DLC that keeps as much of Vanilla "rules" as possible while still making "new" content.
---
Thats kind of what I love about that fight, and MCs in general. Sometimes things can go pretty well just by luck, but theres that sense of danger and worry that it can go to shit so fast. And then, for a final twist of fate, 2 people end up LoSing the shadowbolts and kiting the MCs and finish off the last 30%.
---
Yes, that's what I'm getting at. Also, I'm new to reddit and already attempted to change the title once I realized how loaded "hardcore" means but can't find the edit function.
---
ARCANITE REAPER!
---
Sounds like it'll be some variation of what was in Legion as far as macros/scripting, how much they're going to remove we don't know.
---
This correlation between "rushing end game content" and "expecting post1.12 content" has absolutely no relation to each other.  
---
I doubt you can present any meaningful data that suggests end-game rushers primarily seek TBC after Naxx.  
---
In fact private servers show you the opposite. A lot of the people on private servers who completed Naxx on an earlier private server, ended up rolling again on the latest iteration. A small percentage of them decided to go play TBC on a TBC private server, but there were very few.
---
This is a good point. I think WoW finally struck that balance with dying where “hardcore” MMOs felt a little too punishing, Vanilla felt underpunishing. 
---
I think on pvp servers where you could be ganked in a second they needed to soften the effects of that corpse run a bit so players only felt slightly frustrated when they die. I just leveled to mid 50s on a pservers and definitely felt extremely frustrated after dying in a few situations either where I was picked off in a pvp situation while questing or travelling or where a mob or two got a lucky chain of crits. 
---
I think vanilla and probably even BC we’re the right level of punishing to bring in the casual players and make the game thrive. It’s definitely an extremely important design decision which blizzard has gotten wrong by catering to casuals in later expansions. 
---
As a side note players have been alive to Blizzard’s tenendcy to cater to casuals and the effect it had on the game since BC/Wotlk. We could feel the game getting too simplified and safe a decade ago and it seems like it took a long time for the casual-catering to get so bad it killed the interest of even casual players.
---
I'd suggest Shaman or Druid if you intend on staying Horde.
---
Yeah, I love Classicast, but I think the format that Josh from CtC has is ideal. My favorite bits are the Forum and Fauna sections. It's always a weird feeling to be driving in the car, and all of a sudden some dude is talking about *your* comment.
---
That's like saying a game should be limited to 16:9 because people without 21:9 are at a disadvantage.
---
You'd have to level slower than Asmongold's mom to be lvl 48 by phase 2.
---
Everyone type x3 /salutes, /sleep, make your peace and get some coffee.

🦀🦀🦀JAGEX IS FINALLY HIDING POLL RESULTS🦀🦀🦀
---
It's called an opinion....which he mentioned at the start. Doesn't mean he's wrong or right just his take on it....
---
That's a really good point and I never considered the behavior of those on private servers.
---
...dude...that murloc boss. IDK if it's like this in actual Vanilla, but on the popular PS i play on it's a 1-attempt thing, because the disciple dies. But I've literally NEVER gotten him killed. You really have to overlevel it, or just have 3 hella strong DPS.
---
I think there are a lot of people that expect/hope TBC to start showing up after 2+ years of Classic. It's been brought up on this subreddit about 30 times in the past 6 months.
---
Yeah, that fight requires some wide toolkit use. I remember assigning an earthbind/frost trap kite pattern for the healer to kite, and it actually worked really well. It's crazy how a boss with almost no mechanics can make you have to think so far outside of the box.
---
You can develop "horizontally". Add more dungeons for 1-59. Add more dungeons for 60 level. Add more raids below Naxx, add one raid with naxx-level once a few years. It'll increase number of options when it comes to leveling and gear, probably it'll very slightly increase player power, because they will be able to better optimize gear, but it won't obsolete old content.
---
And if the game stays stagnant the exact same thing will happen eventually ...  If classic is a success they will probably do the equivalent of private servers with time capsules for each expansions and probably some sort of TLP servers that go through all the xpacs in order to keep people around longer (although individual servers will suffer for it).
---
Oh my god
---
Wait we also purge
---
Who cares what 'elitists' or anyone else thinks... Release your inner naivety and your inner child... and just have fun. Do what YOU want to do.
---
*gasp* 3 jobs!
---
&gt;The funny thing is all the casual players who actually has a chance of ranking in phase 1 if blizzard does this is not gonna be able to rank if wsg gets implemented
---
If you think casual players have any chance of actually ranking regardless of when they implement BG's you are entirely delusional.
---
It doesn't stack, but you want as many as you can for the most uptime because the % isn't that high and the buff doesn't last longer.
---
everybody point and laugh
---
I think they all go to dwarfs so they can constantly say “and my axe”. Then everyone laughs on discord. Times are good. You kill a dragon.
---
So basically this map is wrath of the lich king.
---
He's also all hype.
---
I just most my hand and use the arrow keys when im picking my nose.  I guess i only really take my left hand off they keyboard when im not doing something 'important' (autorunning somewhere, usually)
---
It's a bit easier for melee, I've been able to blind and cheapshot players 20-30 levels higher than me then escape, but casters are completely screwed. I would gladly go 1v5 against lvl48 casters on either my rogue or priest.
---
At 60 there are two main archetypes you'll fill:
---
1. Elemental PvP burst damage + support
---
2. Resto PvE Chain heal spam + totems support
---
As far as the class goes, it's the "true hybrid" in the sense that you do all your things at once, as opposed to druid who fills one role at a time depending on the form. I found it the most enjoyable, with access to burst damage, sustained damage, resurrection, water walking, great support capabilities, reincarnation for wipe recovery, fantastic toolkit like earthbind, frostshock, purge, nova totem to get rogues out of stealth...
---
If your priority is rushing max level and dungeoning/raiding then the class might be average. But if you're planning a journey throughout the game you will savor, then shaman's versatility will make it really fun.
---
Unlike vanilla wow, most games nowadays filter you into playing with people of similar skill levels so it definitely takes some patience for more experienced players. People in video games generally seem to have less of that now. The good news is that it only takes watching a 10 minute youtube video to learn how to play your character to a minimum level of skill required in a group without holding the rest of the group back — it’s very easy to learn.
---
And i like big buff and i cannot lie - shaman
---
The purple pine forests and water make it such a beautiful and serene place. I agree, definitely underrated. Unfortunately, it's a lowbie island in the corner of the map that it doesn't see much use since it's so isolated.
---
Guild Wars 2 has absolutely amazing music (written by the guy who did the music for Morrowind), that only half of the time fits the areas. This beautiful, relaxing music comes on, right in the middle of a pvp war zone.
---
Druids got viable*
---
Hahahaha!
---
Oof that last sentence says all you need to know about this guy. Even though I kind of agreed with you at first.
---
What?
---
It depends entirely on the guild, setting expectations is key.  
---
Personally i would want to be in guild A), as min maxing and getting the raids done efficiently and fast is what matters to me.  
---
Memespecs and slackers are wasting people's time in such a guild.  
---
Why do sub-par dps playing some pvp-arms spec when fury is better? You're just letting down the raid.
---
Blizzard changed armor textures because of "Bikini armor" reasons.
---
I stand corrected
---
Yeah no we have idea
---
Summer should have the Rogue icon.
---
I agree with Uldaman. I think it's also because of the level range. It's basically 2 different instances in one. Being able to do the final boss and that back end of the instance with ease usually means the mobs in the front/outside of the instance are giving little to no XP.
---
This depiction of a sad woman being shunned by spiteful Lesbians is an accurate portrayal of classic wow culture.
---
It's seriously likely some marriages will end because of WOW Classic...
---
Y’all are worried about TA and WF, but I’m ready for Sentry Totem again.
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I've felt this way for a long time but have had a hard time expressing myself and you've worded it much better than I could.
---
Tastes are subjective but I've heard decent arguments from both sides.
---
lol Ok. Take off your rose colored glasses bud there were toxic people in Vanilla just like there are helpful supportive players on pservers. No community is totally homogenous.
---
Germanflamethrower.meme.jpg
---
Guess we'll find out.
---
Ya then no.
---
It's Classic.
---
I have to agree with this, but you're not going to be playing 100% rested until your characters are in their high 30s.
---
Towards the end of TBC, I went a little "alt crazy" and rolled up a set of 10 characters on alliance with every race/gender combination. The male night elf became my bank alt and the other 9 were played such that after level 10, none of them was more than 1 level different from the other 8. Got 'em all into the mid 60s before WotLK released.
---
Advantages:
---
1. Rested XP. But this rested XP doesn't "double" your XP gain. It doubles your MOB XP gain. And if you're actively questing, your quest XP and mob XP are generally roughly equal when unrested. So it will take you roughly 66% of the time instead of 50%. Still significant, but not as good as some may claim it to be. But even with the rested XP, you're not gonna be able to play 100% rested until your mid to late 30s. 
---
2. Crafting. By having the 9 active characters with an assortment of professions, I was never in the position of having to search for a crafted item from some other profession that I needed as a mat for my current profession. Need an "Inlaid Mithril Cylinder"? Just switch over to my blacksmith, craft it, and mail it to the character needing it. Also having a lot of characters really helped my tailor in skills up just from making bags. Think about it, each character has 4 bags (more if they're purchased bank slots) and whenever the tailor leveled high enough to make a large bag, the tailor went into an orgy of bag making and mailing to all of the alt, producing one hell of a lot of skill ups.
---
Disadvantages:
---
1. Slower leveling per character. And this is a significant disadvantage. When you do a dungeon run with a PUG, there's a good chance that you're going to meet some cool people that you'd like to keep in touch with and run future instances with (totally unlike the LFG system retail currently has). Unfortunately, by leveling multiple characters at the same time, those "cool people" are going to out level you quite rapidly and you're not going to be able to group with them for future dungeon runs. Not a good thing in Vanilla given how much the social element plays in the game.
---
2. Enchanting. Since Inscription wasn't introduced until WotLK, the utility of enchanted is very limited. It's more than rather annoying to have a highly skilled enchanted who can enchant anyone's gear EXCEPT the gear of your alts. (yes, there's the exception of BoE items that haven't yet been used, but still can't enchant the BoP items).
---
I feel like some of the abilities graphics have gone downhill, but it was so it wouldn't be so overloaded as more and more abilities came out.
---
Aspect of the wild, finally useful
---
The “spirit of vanilla”, whatever it is, most likely a design-approach, definitely isn’t “everyone be nice.”
---
Played mage, shamans definitely boom harder but in chunks and require free casting. Mages *usually* should spend a lot of time polymorphing and causing chaos that way.
---
Stating a fact doesn't mean in angry. Relax.
---
......what’s this?!
---
Lots of people are willing to do the whole 18/6 split. So there's that...
---
This is beautiful. I appreciate the masterpiece you’ve created here and you should feel proud lmao Can’t wait for the reboot coming out.
---
Except it's ranged AP only. So it's only as good as the amount of hunters you have.
---
Wait, windfury proc's could proc again????!!!
---
There were fist weapons in vanilla i think
---
These guys on private servers are scofflaws! Scofflaws!!!   How dare they break Blizzard’s contractually imposed rules in order to play a game that wasn’t even available in paid-format. Arrest them immediately officer.
---
I guess it varies on the classes, but I'm going to say it's just about always no.
---
We still don't know whether or not hunter trib runs will be a things, but mage/lock DM lasher farming and mara princess farming will 100% be things. This is going to generate a ton more gold than having a group of 5 clearing dungeons, since they have to clear the non-optimal (in g/hr) trash mobs.
---
And even if it isn't a class that can solo/2 man farm dungeons well, you still need to compare g/hr that they could get by grinding in the world, gathering profs, and fishing; all of which can get pretty solid g/hr.
---
Only the vanillest of them all
---
Love it ! Sperg Army!
---
Auto run is a thing you know that everyone makes use of. You know how easy it is to do all those things you just mentioned while auto running and using right click hold to steer your character? Takes less than a second lol. 
---
But hey, I'll enjoy farming keyboard turners in Phase 2. It's cool
---
I hated what they did to shaman in BC. Are you all forgetting the massive Shaman protests in BC, where all the shamans committed suicide en masse.
---
Back when wow came out the dying mechanic was considered very casual as you only lost some durability on your armor.
---
Sorry, you can't. He called it.
---
I'm getting mixed information about what classes can and cannot wear.
---
There was a post earlier about plate shoulders that even hunters would wear (because they looked awesome), yet I was previously informed that Hunters simply could NOT equip plate.
---
So which is it? Can hunters not equip plate (and by extension wands and maces?) or can they (I'm assuming if this is the case they receive no benefit from doing so?).
---

If you’re a mage then you can get the black lotus in AV. Or you could join the devilsaur maffia on your server.
---
This sub is already full swing on that OSRS efficiency hype train. Can't really be stopped considering how old the game is and how readily available detailed planning is. People most likely will only play what is competitive in a more general sense, and a devoted few will play what they want. It's hard to not be a WoW fan these days and not be playing what's best in retail. Many retail players will bring that mentality too. That's why I'm in support of rebalancing bad specs, but many people want you to suffer for the meme and because they "can't balance one class without ruining the (finely and finally theorycrafted) 'equilibrium' of the game".
---
Totem Twisting was a Vanilla thing right?
---
You can't raid as ele and especially not as enhance, it isn't mechanically feasible. Not unless it's easy farm content or you're the raid leader's girlfriend.
---
No offense but based on this post I can see why some people tend to be rude to you.
---
No, this is Patrick!
---
but really no idea who Dirtylarry is, someone I should know?
---
Classic is not a "remaster". It's not like Warcraft III Reforged. It'll use the original data. Only a very small team works on it and I highly suspect none of them are artists.
---
It's supposed to look like Vanilla. You'll be able to run it in 4K and it'll look fine. There will be options for modern shadows and water and increased ground clutter distance.
---
Yeah, and like I said to the other guy many people aren't going to raid at all.
---
Same situation, so I just started a Guild to become a new community from scratch.
---
Be the content you want to see :)
---
I've said this many times. Private server players will ruin the vanilla experience for everyone else. There will be even less tolerance for hybrids and way more elitism. I hope all private server people will stay on private servers.
---
Your assumptions are rather pessimistic there. First, I suspect the OP would play their characters even if they're not rested. Additionally, rested XP at the lower levels is pretty darn close to useless given how fast one gains those lower levels. The real advantage to rest XP will be when the player gets into their 30s or higher and really need to grind for the next level. And since they're playing 6 characters, that actually means that they accumulate 15 to 18 bubbles of rest per day (variation is based upon how many hours they actually play their characters and of course this rest is spread out among their characters). And since you DON'T want to accumulate the full 30 bubbles of rest (Once you hit 30, no more rest accumulates, so you're wasting the potential to accumulate more rest on that character with 30 bubbles). Once the player gets their characters up high enough that assuming they just play 1 character per day and for all of their play that single day just barely gets them a full level, then you can assume that they would play each character every 6 days. And during those 6 days, the character would accumulate 18 bubbles of rest (90% of a level). And since rest XP only applies to mob XP and not quest XP, it's quite likely that the player will be able to gain an entire level using a combination of mob XP and quest XP without totally depleting their rest.

The most important thing is finding a Guild that fits what you're looking for.

The difference between a Guild that suits your playstyle and a guild that doesn't will literally change how you experience the game.

Yo you prolly don’t remember a weapon called Taran Icebreaker. BOE epic lvl 37. 2h mace with like a 1.7 swing speed....
---
It procs WF constantly.
---
Hunter can't use plate, wands or maces.
---
They can however use mail armor from lvl 40+
---
No1 can know for sure but I did read the API will be based on Legion’s. Not sure if it’s confirmed.

Are you trying to use fist weapons, or no weapons?  Lets say no weapon, because it's more interesting.

I've left out shield abilities, because I interpreted your post as an empty handed warrior.  The above list gives us a look at what you will primarily be doing:  screaming and running.
---
Now lets try for a talent build.
---
[16 into Arms.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AjPxAAA)  We would love to have Sweeping Strikes, but we probably can't justify 4 completely wasted points, can we?  It looks like you can parry bare handed, so we put 5 there.  We improve both Charge and Thunderclap, because we will be screaming and running.  Tactical Mastry and Anger Management to help us because we'll probably have to stance dance a whole bunch to make use of our limited skills.
---
[35 into Fury.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AjPxBcwfDH9AAA)  Booming voice and IDS get us to Piercing Howl.  The rest improve our running and screaming abilities, and finally get us Bloodthirst.
---
I hope you play this, and you make a guild called Run Screaming.
---
1. Lotus is supposed to spawn once per hour
---
2. Private server spawns are dynamic, the fastest I've seen spawn is 15-20 minutes at peak population but usually its more like 30 minutes
---
4. There is something like 4 times the total population of players and the number of raiders / hardcore raiders is even higher than that. There are 30 some guilds clearing AQ40 once a week... on classic there will be maybe 5 per server
---
So if anything lotus will be even cheaper and none of this is relevant ret paladins will still suck.
---
A couple of "census" posts have been done before but the mods have also said they would do a third and final one prior to classic launch so keep your eye out for that.
---
There absolutely were. You can buy brass knuckles from vendors but they suck. The first blue fist weapon drops in stockades iirc.
---
Watch Swifty, he was a very good vanilla player and he always has an exciting personality with new things. It would be like watching someone play wow for the first time ever with full energy. 100% worth watching him because he still hasn't quit wow after 15 years and has a fun personality.
---
Note: rogue don't just seem not to use axes, they physically cannot in vanilla
---
Actually they have reduced spawn rate on private servers. It’s around 2 hour respawn to be blizzlike
---
White fists at levels 10, 20, 30.  A blue at 21, a few more in the 50s.  The first green shows up around 50.

So true. I played Druid through Vanilla and even though I was really shit at it (compared to TBC and onwards) I frequently ended up near the top of the healing metres because of hots and being ok at whack a mole. IIRC one of the more geared and experienced druids was at the top for many encounters
---
What if one day they just release it. Like bam. It’s just there on the launcher.
---
Thats the dumbest thing ive seen on this reddit
---
Is this post a joke? Even a 2h arms pvp spec is going to be doing about as much damage as a pally with it with more uptime, a 2h fury spec will be just fine with it while also having pretty good damage. 
---
&gt;So I'd rather have one of the paladins doing bad dps but still buffing the raid with blessings and Nightfall than a warrior doing really poor dps and only buffing with a NF with lower uptime than the paladin.
---
I'd rather have a ret pally be using a good weapon for a ret pally and giving out buffs while a single warrior does nightfall duty because that's much better.
---
&gt;Also that warrior will be fucking miserable because he knows he can do serious dps but is forcing to wield an axe that nerfs him into the ground. A retri knows and accepts that he won't compete in the meters.
---
This is just moronic. A ret pally also knows he could do serious dps while rolling a warrior as well. Most people who genuinely want to roll ret for raids will do the best they can and nightfall on a ret is not only gimping the melee dps with bringing a ret pally (which in general is fine since raids are easy and don't require that much minmaxing on the dps angle) but more importantly is relegating the nightfull buff uptime to being *fucking garbage* and dicking over every single caster that cares about it.
---
I'm going to assume he was a much higher level than you, in which case you could just take your weapon off when you help lowbies. If you spec fury at 60 bloodthirst doesn't require a weapon to be equipped. So that helps.
---
Or you could just put on some brass knuckles. It looks almost the same.
---
It's also good to know bio vs smoke break, because the smoke breakers are going to be gone again within the hour.
---
MOOOOAAAARR!!!!
---
Melees without threat reduction can do 80% of the DPS of those with it, if they can even get their DPS that high in the first place, and if it's spikey they have to wait longer to even start, DPS is threat limited in vanilla. Enhance is super spikey without great sustain or threat management. It's not unorthodox, it's strait awful. 
---
Casters without mana regen mechanisms can't cast long enough to kill a boss without insane levels of gear. Honestly it was in Naxx where Balance and Elemental first started to get viable, if I remember. Till then they were just ooming machines. As ele you spam lightning bolt till your mana is gone then afk because there's nothing else you can do.
---
There's no way to overcome that except by being in a very casual guild and friends with the right people. Corrupt leadership not focused on success, that's the key.

Yep!

Isn't Tailoring as you level pretty good? The mats come naturally from all the humanoid mobs you kill, so you can get 8 slot and 10 slot bags pretty early, and make a profit on most things you make just from vendoring.

Or, is it really inefficient?

I don't know why he would be sad about that.

Have you ever seen the face of terror when a paladin realizes the MS warrior hacking away at him has WF weapon on?
---
Please just be open to advice as you play, and you will go far. PVE servers are safer, since in a PVP server, enemy factions can fight you almost anywhere. Visit every dungeon when you’re the right level, they’re fun and give you some nice gear.
---
I hated the death penalty in EQ. Hours of progress lost on a death. Especially if it was someone else who caused it. Last game I ever played with that kind of penalty. 
---
I work so hard to progress my character and losing it at all just sucks.
---
&gt;but mage/lock DM lasher farming
---
I thought I read something that said they are going to nerf those drops, either by the amount they sell for or their drop rates. Or am I misinformed?
---
But I do agree. You'd be better off in a group in the open world farming non elites for greys/leather/cloth, and you can usually find herbs and ores while farming the greys as well. Most Instances don't have mines/herbs, and if they do they are usually few and far between.
---
Thank you. I find all of these posts talking as though vanilla was this incredibly hardcore game perplexing. Compared to every mmo that came before it, vanilla wow holds your hand all the way through, is easy to navigate, and not that grindy. 
---
In previous games like EQ or Asheron’s Call (the ones I’m most familiar with) all you really did is kill mobs. Very few quests that offered any worth while xp. You had to hail npcs using chat commands to even find them. 
---
Items were lost on death and were lootable by other players in PvP. When you respawned in EQ you would be at your last bind point completely naked maybe zones away (only casters could self bind, melee classes need to be bound by other players but were only able to in specific areas like cities). If that weren’t enough you also lost a good chunk of xp to boot if you couldn’t get a res from a high level cleric. If you died enough you could even lose a level. Hope you knew your way around to get back because there also weren’t any maps. 
---
Don’t get me wrong wow is a great game and a lot of fun. It allows you to make meaningful progress without having to devote your life to it. It improved on many of the conventions of previous games in the genre. Maybe I’m just old, but his whole circlejerk around the difficulty and hardcore nature of vanilla wow really confuses me.
---
"Meme"? Dude, every landmark, every slot getting something was a joy. Shoulders and Trinkets. Even on my alt in 2006, getting that first set of cloth shoulders made me feel like I was doing something RIGHT.
---
Having both Trinket Slots filled.
---
That first ring that increased a relevant stat.
---
These are nostalgic landmarks. Not your silly "meme". It's like catching your first Pokemon. It made me feel great. That you'd reduce it to that, is frankly, stupid. "Meme". I bet getting your first blue's a "Meme" for you, too.

Probably the most popular latest fresh server. Respawns are dynamic, if there are a lot of people around they don't respawn very fast, if there are a lot of people around they'll respawn fast. You know, it's dynamic...

I thought he was fine after seeing him in a single video. Then I saw how he’s always working with Tipsout and Staysafe (both insufferable) and the cringeworthy discord and guild recruitment shit he’s doing (interviewing potential recruits on stream). Just awful content.
---
Rested XP was there from the beginning. As the other guy said, it used to be more pronounced, to the point of giving you only a fraction of your 100% xp if you played for too long. So say like 200% at rested, once you burn through that it was 100% xp, then (and I dunno what the metric was) after X amount of xp earned at 100% without logging out in an inn, further xp gain was 80% of normal to represent fatigue. 
---
The negative xp was taken out.
---
Can't use it or can't equip it?
---
In this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc4wv3/im_most_excited_for_everyone_to_have_crappy/ekntsx2/
---
People were talking about Herod's shoulders and how even getting their Hunter's the shoulders. I find this odd as according to Wowhead, Herod's shoulders are plate.
---
*out of range from the group*
---
Enhancement was fun to wpvp and bg with?
---
Lots of bad specs though. All classes had 1-2 not viable for raiding. Vanilla had by far the worst spec balance.
---
is this comment bothering you m’am.
---
I want this mounted on my wall so I can navigate with it instead of using the in game map...
---
This guy never been globaled by a naxx shaman before.
---
We will see. I think sharding will make up for dynamic respawns in more positive ways.
---
This is very well done. 
---
What it highlights to me, though, is that Blizzard didn't do a very good job of blending the borders of the zones together. It's a very immediate and sometimes drastic change of landscape that unfortunately makes the entire thing look really pieced together, like a puzzle, instead of an organic world. 
---
Nothing you did wrong OP, this is fantastic, just an observation your work helps highlight that I find interesting.
---
What do you expect from an expansion named "Battle for Azeroth"?
---
You are getting double XP for mobs while you are on your way to and from quests, and quest turn-ins *push* your rested forward so you are playing 100% rested the whole time.
---
Where you really gain an advantage with rested is in dungeons where the mobs are worth more XP + group bonus.
---
Totally agree about crafting, its so much nicer having all profs available instead of wasting *tons* of gold on the AH.
---
Yup. And the rested XP mechanism was also an interesting study in psychology. Originally, you would get normal mob XP if you were rested and only half mob XP if you were fatigued. The beta testers didn't like this and felt as if they were being "punished" for playing. So things were revamped a bit an explained as you getting normal mob XP when unrested and a bonus of twice the mob XP if rested. Of course, the revamping arranged for the actual numbers to be the same. But by describing the effect as a "bonus", the beta testers were quite pleased with the "new system".
---
I played a Hunter in vanilla and was probably closest to your Type C at the time, although remained top 5 in guild DPS in to AQ40 because our guild was full of pretty bad DPS.
---
But just because I haven't seen this before, are you saying it's better to stand at 9 yards from a raid boss as opposed to 35+ so you can run in for a raptor strike in between auto shots during the time in the cycle aimed and multi are both on CD?  Is there anything else more to meleeing during raids than that or is that pretty much it?  Haven't player a Hunter at 60 in 12 years so just wondering what you mean by dive/dance.  Thanks!
---
Aha, why do you think warriors have a higher uptime than pallies?
---
Just curious why you’re not playing. Not trying to change your mind or anything =D
---
Yeah, this guy gets it!
---
Remember, feign death doesn't work against warlocks.
---
Yes it does, while you cast fear.
---
This is my go to pvp spec right now and it is so fun. We will lose the traditional reck bomb in classic but it’ll still be super powerful in combating rogues. 
---
I pretty much just play as a support but if people start to peel me effectively I am
---
Able to just turn and bash them on. Once rogues realize I’m reck they’ll usually fuck off somewhere. Same with Hunter pets, I love when I have a cat just following me around BGs giving me reckoning stacks
---
Man I’m not into the streamer scene, I was honestly surprised there’s WoW streamers. But those guys are beyond losers hahaha
---
I’m doing this with my 2 mains, since I plan on leveling them pretty parallel to each other, Pally and mage. Anything past that is just worrying about future alts and bogging down my gameplay. 
---
Whoever wants to be world first 8 or 9 level 60s though is going to do that for sure.
---
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
PST? Noooooooooooooooo
---
Elemental shaman popping elemental mastery or nature's swiftness and acting as artillery in AV is probably one of the most fun things in the history of WoW.
---
If you are in a position to defend in AV and force a turtle, you can farm literally hundreds of HK's with crit LB and Chain Lightning.
---
In large Wpvp, fire nova totem + goblin sapper is a powerful combo, along with remote aoe slows provided by dropping groudning totem on the move.  Same thing as in AV, throwing crit chain lightning's into crowds and spot heals wins wars, and is fun as hell.
---
Quests push your xp bonus up though. So a 1.5 lvl rested could lvl up 3ish lvls
---
Do you have a source of the 2 hour spawn rate?
---
I played vanilla and private servers throughout the years. I’m just over it at this point. The fun isn’t there anymore. If there was a 60 boost I’d consider playing (sorry #nochanges). I’m also a father now and I wouldn’t be able to keep up with my friends or whoever I played with.
---
Well i believe BFA went live at 6pm central, basically midnight in the UK. So it was a midnight release over there. I’d prefer that over a midnight release in the u.s imo, just because i’d get more time to play that night!
---
hunters are top dps in first tier and still strong in second tier they only drop off after that
---
Can't use and can't equip it.
---
They can however use Herod's shoulders because they are mail, so hunters level up to 40+ and go back and run SM for those shoulders.
---
Maybe you are confusing mail with plate?
---
There is:
---
Cloth
---
Leather
---
Mail 
---
Plate (Warriors, Paladins only)
---
Exactly. you can't get HKs by killing lowbies so I imagine it will be a blast but not as bad as people are imagining. Not going to lie though, if I'm wrong that only makes the game more fun IMO.
---
Until you build up enough gear to go ele in pvp so you can blow people up, some guilds will even let you go ele in raids too if your farming older content etc.
---
Im for no changes, when we say that we are talking about gameplay stuff like balance being the same, progressive itemization and all that stuff also no sharding fuck sharding
---
Man, that really sucks. May as well stay on the Pserver then.
---
Damn this is one of the funniest pictures I've seen in a while and I can't even explain why.
---
Herod's shoulders are mail, not plate, [even according to wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7718/herods-shoulder).
---
I honestly made it a habit to whisper the shaman every. single. time. he opened a fight with earth shock (if ele or enh) instead of dropping wf -&gt; str -&gt; mana totem.
---
Since you get 2 drops a boss in classic, in a 40 man raid, and weapons are typically 15% and less chance to drop, items but especially weapons are scarce. 
---
Since DW enhance wasnt a thing, nor was rogues with Axes, fury warriors get first dibs. Swords/Daggers/Fist generally go to rogues and hunters get the last picks. 
---
That said, you should probably have a 2h Fury warrior or two to alleviate loot pressure.
---
Generally, speaking, unless its like 1 month till AQ release and youre in a guild running 2 30 man MC/Ony/BWL clears  a week as a guild...you wont have all warriors with Deathbringer, Chul'Shoruk, and or Doom's Edge. Some will have swords from MC, or the fist from BWL, maybe someone is rocking the sword set from ZG. 
---
Everyone knows what the "BIS" weapons are, but the nature of raiding in vanilla is such that outfitting your raid entire raid in BIS between tiers is unrealistic (On live we went 4 months without an eye of shadow and another 6 without a T2 Priest chest...we had 6 priests--to be fair I think 1 eye and 2 chests dropped in that time, but both players summarily quit the game not too long after getting the loot)
---
Right on. I’m still uncertain how hard I’m going to go. My mind fluctuates between taking a year to get to 60 and not giving too much of a shot or instead going haaard into it.
---
They used to be mail in vanilla. Wowhead has the retail stats.
---
I don’t, but recall reading a thread that claimed 1-2 hours and had a source. This is part of the reason many are excited for a discussion about dynamic respawns
---
Mmmmm thc
---
That shoulder was changed to plate in Legion for the new transmog system. In Classic it was originally a mail item. Wowhead lists items as they are in the current game which is why it shows up as plate there.
---
Hmm well that throws out 100% rested but you do get a lot of xp for quest completion
---
I was a shaman in classic. Never again. It was fun in dungeons and pvp, but raiding was heal or sit. And while I like shaman healing, I hate only healing. If I play the vanilla servers it'll be a pure DPS or a prot warrior with dibs on 2-handers.
---
Lmao!
---
Well kinda. It ties in to the realm sizes. The game was designed around roughly 2500 concurrent players online at the time because that was the number they estimated to be the highest they could go without losing that "small town" feeling where you recognize people and bad actions can have serious repercussions.
---
So the design was to enable people to be assholes but doing so would come with being looked down on by the rest of the server so people generally tried to behave.
---
Wtf is wrong with you lol
---
This shows that there was a lot of room to expand the map, expansions were completely unnecessary. I enjoy the part to the west of Stonetalon, where the Pandaren Empire was supposed to be according to WC3 lore. Shame they fucked it up and made Pandaria because of Kung-fu Panda.
---
[Here you go.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Scarab_Lord)
---
I wonder how many of those people legit played vanilla and how many are just spouting shit based on their playing around on private servers
---
Gorilla Sinew, Pristine Yeti Horn...what else?
---
That's not just political views, that's HATE SPEECH!
---
 / s
---
If you like ganking/being ganked then play on a PvP server.
---
If you don't then just roll PvE.
---
Phase 2 crisis solved.
---
Come on baby, I got blessing of protection! 👌
---
I plan to level as enhance to 40, then go ele to 60 and raid heal.  
---
Currently have a lvl 31 enhancement shaman on a pserver and thought WF + 2H was really fun and pretty good.  A little too inconsistent but when it hits it really hits.  I can't imagine the pre 1.4 stuff. 0_o
---
Noice.
---
That's me on the weekends right now. My wife and I have a 4-month-old and Saturday and Sunday mornings they both sleep until 9-10am. I usually get up around 6 am. I love having that time to relax but right now I feel it is wasted because I can't play Classic.
---
Wouldn't it be just awful if I came down with a nasty sickness the day of release? A sickness so serious I have to take 2 whole weeks off of work to recover?
---
I don’t understand people who haven’t tried both factions. Aside from hardcore RP nerds I guess.
---
Honestly, if I were to ever do it again, I’d take it one day at a time. Getting max before everyone else is cool and all, but people will always be looking for replacements. Also, with the classic schedule, you can afford to go slower than usual.
---
That's why you downrank
---
Have you see the bloopers for that? They had to redo since the DK actually killed the 2 "ganking" horde. Yes, DKs were severely OP when they were introduced.
---
To imagine having to undo over ten years worth of work just to make a game playable again.
---
cat is best levelling pet, max out bite and claw from taming other pets, bite has small CD and claw is spammable so use both, other pets are dps loss but can be useful i guess but i used cat whole way, you can respec pets yes and basically just max stam and armor and ignore resistances and your fine really, doesnt matter too much
---
Theres a black lotus only mages can get?
---
Thing is paladins bring a lot of utility too especially in PvP.
---
They are still braindead easy and the difference of a good and a bad paladin isnt huge. 
---
Invest in some addons, set up decursive, keep BoF on your warrior, cleanse with said decursive, heal in the meantime. Paladin raid and PvP healing is just very repetitive in comparison to the shaman way of life.
---
Amazing. I thought the whole idea behind this project was that people wanted VANILLA and that blizzard was wrong to think otherwise. In the first place.
---
You people do realize that “people will get bored and population will decline” was the original thinking that got them to keep launching expansions, right? So what is it that you want exactly, because its obviously not Vanilla. Do you think Blizzard should keep relaunching the whole of WoW every 1.5 decades? Will that keep interest high? Ludicrous.
---
Yeah. I don’t get why some want to level to 60 in a week, but more power to them. I really want to get to 60 after 2 or 3 months though, so I can have a good number of MC resets, so I’ll have gear for BWL.
---
I'm a simple man. I see u/lolzexd posts something. I upvote.
---
hunters are top DPS dealers for first two tiers or so, only drop off after so dw about dps they are powerful for a while
---
Agree - it was a good compromise, and the current situation doesnt even make sense to me.
---
Specifically thinking as a warsong flag runner as tanky level 39 cheetah lol - selfish ;)
---
I got the name I wanted ?   
---
Log off for two days.  Let the madness slow.
---
loyalty levels really fast its not a big deal apart from the first few hours after taming
---
Ill never forget flying through the northern part of redridge at 9 years old on my rogue, only to go through burning steppes and seeing the imps, orcs, and dragon(kin)s. Man, that had me excited seeing skull leveled mobs knowing one day i’d smack the shit outta them.
---
Show bottom left action bar, show bottom right action bar, show right action bar 1, show right action bar 2
---
"I understand vanilla ran on literally a potato."
---
You take that back.
---
Many years I played at the lowest settings and favored Caves because running that game was a damn struggle.
---
Yell, We are home !
---
Self employed do what they love? Weird standard of losing.

Rebind EVERYTHING, talk to Marshall Dugan and kill some gorram wolves
---
This is my current struggle. I really want to roll Sham but I absolutely don't want to be stuck healing. Of course, I realize it's a hybrid class, and that means off-healing is a minimum requirement (which I'm cool with). I don't really want to roll a pure DPS class though.
---
That sounds quite nice, would be a good option if Classic it's succesful enough.
---
I see, thank you! That clears up that misunderstanding.
---
Halo PC
---
At that point it really isnt a discussion about contribution anymore.
---
At that point you can bring level 55s and carry them through or just run with 25people to distribute more loot. 
---
On farm you can dick around by changing lots of metrics including bringing subpar classes.
---
Elemental can indeed be nice. If the fight is short, a shaman wont run oom and do zero damage.
---
One sec, let me call up Blizzard and ask them...
---
Chances are there will be Fresh server or "seasons"

No but the amount of big dick ego trash talk is absurd. I’m all for people doing what they enjoy/good at, but really?
---
I mean GW2 has every zone still be useful. To be fiar some zones are MORE useful than others but it wouldn't be a waste of time to play on old maps. And to be even more fair GW2 is not as popular as Wow, so maybe that model isn't perfect.
---
An alternate storyline going forward maybe?

I'm just trying to understand how Blizzard could move the game forward without repeating themselves.

I don't like this idea. I hope the Nos team thats part of the classic team will stick with what they have announced.
---
Resilience destroyed any desired i had to pvp when it came out.
---
Lol nah
---
This is what peak Performance looks like, you may not like it but this is it.
---
Oh yea. Never considered the PvP implications
---
I know it's ranged AP only, but still strong as fuck if you have atleast 4 hunters to keep the uptime close to 100%, you can compete with most of mid of the pack DPS but it's very unlikely ur guild will be focusing on hunters. I was testing the other day on a PTR server with this item https://classicdb.ch/?item=19896, and you can get up to +750 ranged ap, breaking 1,100~1,200ish DPS.
---
Behold the sword of a thousand truths.
---
I remember when I was playing vanilla. I had an Assassination Rogue open on me with Garrote, Stack Deadly Poisons for the damage over time, then apply a 5 point Rupture. This happened in a period of about 5 seconds. He vanished and I bleed to death from the DOTs. I wasn't the most equipped Mage at the time but to see that sort of damage was just plain sick.
---
Off meta isn't bad.
---
Its too early to say anything about it. Classic isnt even released yet. If the demand after a few years of Classic is high enough they said they might to TBC. I know you want to know about this, but it is way too early.
---
Personally i would like classic, tbc and wotlk (holy trinity for me) and hope they keep it like that. They might do different servers for each expansion but i think that would divide the playerbase too much. 
---
For now just look forward to Classic and enjoy that for the next few years id say !!
---
Aaaaaahhhhh
---
The guild my friends and I are planning will only have 3-4 Hunters in the raid group from the beginning. Specially as their dmg isn't great long term, but also we don't need more than for traqs
---
How do you feel about that source?  Do you think you could find the thread you mention?  I would love to see their source.
---
forget it, rankers will play 30 hours, sleep 8 ( if not 4 ), play 30 and so on
---
to get rr13 you need :
---
wait 1 year until everything settle down
---
have best premade in game
---
play 16 hours a day
---
choose an underpop server containing bad/few pvpers
---
pick atleast 2 of the obove
---
Whoever wants to farm for two months for all those matts can have the damn thing as far as im concerned
---
It’s a question that I don’t believe has an exact answer yet and is a decision I would not want to be the one to make.
---
Could they go the TBC, WOTLK route? Sure, people would eat that up and love it. But at what point do you stop? Most will say “no more after Wrath!”. Do they then reset back to vanilla? Do they then branch off and do new original work with wrath as the base?
---
Or do they do head in a different direction from vanilla Naxx? 
---
It will be interesting to see how it unfolds.
---
I will enjoy it for sure. But I can't help thinking, some years down the road, everyone is geared up and there is nothing more to do or accomplish. You have all your slots filled with alts and each and everyone of them did everything that can be done. Then what? How will Blizzard keep people in this situation from leaving?
---
But you are right, it's too early. Still, it's a valid concern. I'm not keen on spending a ton of time on a game I know will be dead in 5 years.
---
Everyday I wake up and say "today's the day" but alas...
---
Most importantly don't start a fight when your pet is eating (takes 10? seconds). The moment your pet gets in combat it stops eating and gaining happiness so you potentially waste the food
---
I know some people who raided as 30/0/21, and primarily DPS’d. They were crazy try hards who farmed everything and anything to give a boost. They did decent damage. Half the time it’s just mana conservation that’s the real enemy. But your spells simply don’t have synergy with any debuff other than nightfall, so that’s a bummer. I was 30/0/21 and healed. I wasn’t putting out great numbers, but I wasn’t a complete waste either. 
---
It’s doable from a raiding perspective but definitely not preferable. The raid would rather just have a mage or resto shaman. That said, in PvP.... it’s incredible. So much fun. It’s one of the stronger PvP specs in the game, imo.
---
He is the major of red ridge.
---
14 hours... pfft. Maybe if you're trying to get to rank 12 on a pve server.
---
Thetr will be people doing 18-20.
---
While your at it, ask for a release date too and maybe these two topics will stop popping up 50 times a day lol
---
/yell FINALLY... THE /u/woedas HAS COME BACK...
---
/yell TO AZEROTH!
---
Looooooool omg I love it.
---
Game isn’t even out and people already want more content?
---
I don’t get it. So you want Vanilla or Vanilla+Strawberry with sprinkles?
---
I never got the sense that WoW wasn’t a large enough game. Was pissed that I was forced to upgrade to TBC and make all my items and attunements useless.
---
Strat living can yield some good gold/hr if your group is efficient. There are lots of big ticket items that can drop on top of the 80-120 gold in righteous orbs the group gets per run.
---
There’s the flask recipe(~600-1000g), robe of the void recipe (idk) and the tome for max rank tome of conjure food(~300g)
---
If your group is geared and built to speed clear it would you can maybe do 2 runs an hour.
---
This guy runs too fast off cliffs and dies from fall damage. \^
---
Then you quit and stop giving blizzard money, they are probably A-ok with that as a company solely driven to make money.
---
I was not their for it but, there was a legendary story about one of the shamans in our guild. He hit the boss, for 2% of it's total hp in one hit, ahnked res'd hit the boss for another 1.5% then died again. In two attacks and a total of 9 seconds he led raid dps on the guilds first rag kill. I Don't even know how many times WF has to pro off of WF to hit rag for 3.5% in two attacks but, it must have been a lot.
---
That was one of the cool things about classic though. Some times the impossible happens and it's amazing, and you still remember 15 years later.
---
toxic 14 year olds are way more fun to play with than elitist neckbeard 33 year olds
---
Needs to be a 6 shooter with one chamber empty for the time they actually get WF procs.
---
E N E M Y  G H O U L
---
Youre all for people doing what they enjoy, except fuck those losers tho right?
---
A good Shaman twists WF/GoA.
---
but utility deals no damage :&lt;  
---
back in the days it wasn't a problem for the most ppl. But today since everybody wants to minmax...still probably gonna roll a paladin prob on ret.
---
Yep, this.

Entertainers can't entertain. Got it.

"every character class will come with an innate passive ability \[...\]that ability is shared automatically with everyone in the group"

Shamans forgetting to place WF totem and warriors not battle shouting want to have a word! &gt;:(
---
Madseason and frostdadamus are great.
---
The hate for those three is really implemented deep in this sub huh? They all seem fine to me, content looks pretty much the same as all other classic content creators doings.
---
Yup, same boat.
---
former shammy in classic here. by far my favorite class. no regrets.

We’re gonna kill the auctioneers? Okay bro, cool story.

&lt;Deus Vult&gt; is an 18+ horde pve guild “less raids, better raids”

We are raiding from 11pm to 3 am EST Friday and Saturday.

---
Well vanilla -&gt; tbc -&gt; wrath is easily 7 years of content and I doubt they're too concerned about what they're going to do with a minor franchise in the year 2026 just yet.
---
Yes because Mages have blink so they can get there first.
---
Really? It's probably the easiest Vanilla leveling I've ever done on Horde... Didn't even feel the faction imbalance!
---
There's an impostor among us, and he touched my ass.
---
IMO give shamans old windfury. It's not going to anger the #nochange crowd if it's from a previous patch right?
---
the issue isnt really 60s. its the change in mentality from "get to 60, kill those who antagonize you" to "kill every opposite faction member you can all the time". 
---
Which is great (its how I will play from day one), nothing is more fun than leveling and jumping/being jumped by players your level. 
---
In the case of STV, you may have low 50s characters coming to fuck up lowbies because they themselves are getting ganked in their leveling zones--so they want to repay the favor. but outside of flightpath camping, there are better ways during phase 2 for a 60 to get honor.
---
What's the goal here for those three bosses?  Just to vendor all the items that drop?  Or is there something else beyond that for Maurodon runs?
---
Happily sob and grin like an idiot that I finally get to play a version of WoW worth playing.
---
Jump
---
Not necessarily true. It is very, very dependent on not only the server size and pvp population. But also if you can get into a premade over the 5-6 hours.
---
There will be premades on servers that can hit rank 14 in the same amount of time week wise by playing 4-6 hours a night as others on a different server playing 8-12 hours a day. It's very much predicted off of your server.
---
Haha
---
This is giving me anxiety
---
I would say the problem is that you want to keep building up. I think a heroes journey has a begging and an end. I think the problem is people wanna play their same old character long after their story has ended. If you have T3 equivalent stuff. Your journey is over and you should make a new character. They should just focus on increasing the size of the world and player driven content.
---
Not a 62 dragon, a skull-HOLY SHIT WTF IS THAT?!
---
Getting ganked in STV and coming out the other side made me the man I am today.
---
Swifty is a nice guy, but with age hes gotten absolutely awful at WoW. He gets carried in PvP and cant even clear heroic raids since ive watched him in Legion.
---
You can play WoW classic with a 15 years old computer... That shouldn't be a problem.
---
Your two second google just says its a thing that exists in wow.  That doesnt say anything about respawn rates.  
---
El oh el
---
Oh don't worry, the pair of us have already got an agreement with our partners that they help us out, cook food etc and let us smash wow for the week that we'll take them on holiday on our next leave dates :) 
---
Currently the plan is - 
---
Sleep until one hour before log in - Get up and have a run so that our body is ticking over good before we start. 
---
We will then do 30 hours solid, followed by 6 hours sleep. Then we will play it by ear in terms of sleep/playing time but expect to do no less that 16 to 18 hours a day for the rest of that week. 
---
Seeing as we often do that while treating patients in the military, can't see why we'd have an issue with the gross sleep pattern!
---
Another thing a lot of people miss is grinding going from point A to B. Whenever you are at full health+mana on your way to that next quest you are probably doing something wrong. 
---
Especially in the first 15 levels, these small chuncks of exp add up and can make that next quest go from orange to yellow that much quicker.
---
Try reading 😂
---
I remember it was pretty fun, we did pvp 95% of the time (but not at a real hardcore level, just with friends). I don’t think we had the best gear or specs but it was feeling nice the whole time (wf proc with crits ftw) - BGs against premades were worse though.

---
No, I totally understand that. I may have come off wrong, but I'm not saying everyone should play through slowly. It's more of me stating that vanilla WoW should remain vanilla WoW, regardless of the certain playerbase that consumes content fast and wants to move on to the next thing. 
---
Classic WoTLK and Classic TBC, while great expansions, really moved away from what vanilla WoW was and had a lot of incidental impacts which really changed the nature of the game. By this I mean less player interaction due to dungeon finder or less world PVP and world events because content became instanced or traveling the land became inconsequential with flying mounts.
---
ele after 40 with even medicore int/sp gear is the fastest way to level.
---
prior to that 2h is the way to go with rockbiter and flurry.
---
Thanks Anders &amp; Quentinsacc. I'll give BM a try. It sounds much better than I thought it was.

You should be able to level multiple alts in phase 1

Something I've just thought of- would following the gank squad around be a good strategy? Your honor eventually goes away after you've been killed a certain number of times, right? It's been a while since I've played vanilla so I could be mistaken there. But if that is the case, once you've been killed, say 5 times, you just follow them around and be a nuisance. Sure, they will kill you again, over and over, but eventually they are going to have enough lowbies following them around that it won't be an efficient method of ranking anymore. Logging off and letting them move onto the next target is making the process more efficient for them.
---
the nochanges crowd are hypocrites if you want to go real extreme.
---
They want shamans WF to be in the nerfed state because "1.12 warts and all" but yet when Battlegroups are mentioned, introduced in that same patch its suddenly "Well its bad for classic so it shouldn't be there'.
---
I can understand both side of the argument, but its not a "no changes v changes" argument, its a "what should be in vanilla" debate. And I personal rather WF not be in a permanently nerfed to the ground state.
---
The solution is to make leveling from 60-70 hard as fuck, make it so you need T2.5 or T3 to kill shit out there. 
---
It adds new content on top while still requiring you to complete all the old shit first (you will remember in vanilla there wasnt a welfare update that brought the server ilvl floor up ever time a new raid came out--to do BWL you needed your MC/Ony/ZG (once it was out) gear to get moving in there. YOu couldnt stand much of a chance in AQ without BWL quality gear. 
---
This has the downside of making your further content development used and utilized by an ever shrinking group of people. Which is also bad design.
---
When you see your favorite vanilla zone, you'll definitely be glad you waited
---
Guys... all your new friends are here. We are them. Now we’re the friends.
---
You know, it's possible Classic WoW will become niche and the playerbase as a whole (at least the majority)  will want to move on to the expansions. If that were to happen, I too would want the emphasis on eventually so everyone has a chance to experience vanilla.
---
My guess is this is a trial baloon.
---
If this works well and stays popular they will probably do TBC and Wrath on their own stand alone system (not Connected to eachother)
---
As for the Individual Classic system. I think they will probably poll the community and see if they want full wipes and resets or to just keep them at max level and maybe just start new servers.
---
Quests in alterac mountains and western half of hillsbrad go into the mid-high 30s is why
---
Yikes. I’ll leave this here for you. Good luck out there.

Only read the first couple sections, but man lol I quit playing in WotLK and haven't kept up with the game since, but the way you describe how "shocked" someone from retail will be is funny.
---
I remember hearing they lowered the mount level to 30 then to like 20, right? Like holyyy shit, having a mount was such a source of pride. It took what seemed like an eternity to get to 40 and get my first mount, but that's what made it so damn special. Loved mounting up in a PuG with high 30's just to flex on 'em.
---
Honestly I like to think he got help from Chuck Norris's toon in classic wow.
---
That only happens when you play the wrong faction. Come, join the Horde and all the plate armor shall be yours.
---
the "lazy bastard" is the guy who does not summon the others? sounds pretty bfa to me
---
Classic servers should remain, unchanged, for anyone to enjoy anytime in the future. Even if the majority moves on, I'm sure there will be enough people playing the game for at least a few full servers at all times.
---
I think what will happen is Blizzard will release all expansions eventually. As separate servers, of course, no forced upgrades. It's a no brainer for Blizzard. Relatively small effort for a large payoff. Everyone can play their favorite expansion(s). A lot of people will never unsubscribe. :)
---
Vanilla could use a post Naxx 20 man raid. Something harder than T2.5 but easier than T3 as a catchup mechanic (just as ZG made BWL easier, and AQ20 gear would make AQ40 easier (Hardcore guilds went straight in, clearing AQ40, shittier guilds like mine were still in BWL when AQ came out, letting us gear up with BWL and AQ20 before AQ40)).
---
Would be great if the loot flushed out shit specs, say some good mp5/spell school damage intended for balance/shadow/elemental. Or sets for enhance/feral/ret that made them more viable. 
---
Whether or not that existed, what I really want is a No Loot prestige raid tier. It would open after you have killed Kel'Thuzad. You would restart with MC/ONY but they drop no loot and its tuned for a 100% T3 outfitted raid. When you kill them you unlock the next tier ZG/BWL and you get a title, rinse repeat all the way to Naxx tuned for a 100% T3 raid. The fight mechanics would be updated where needed to make the fights hard and not just big numbers. This ideally would provide a true test of a guild with new content to learn and a competitive even playing field for "who is the best" since there is a cap to the loot available, everyone can theoretically gear out their entire raid before ever attempting it.
---
You are blessed. I envy you. 
---
Don't prepare. Except maybe taking a few weeks off if you can when release date confirmed. Doing noobish things will give you great memories for later. Also you can ask in game, good way to meet people. 
---
I've never really played Alliance. Maybe that could be a new way to play the game. But I don't know if I'm ready to bed with the enemy. I would feel dirty.
---
Elites will exist, luckily, Vanilla wasn't really as hard of a game as people make it out to be. Mostly just time consuming. Common players who frequent video games will be able to shine in Vanilla in their own aspect/guild/community.

It rewards installing an addon.

IMagine if they had more players on the "classic Servers" then the "Live Servers"
---
i stayed up so late one time that i had a WoW hangover
---
To be fair, this was sort of the attitude in vanilla from my experience, and even I was guilty of that eliteist behavior....but, I'm going to not do that this time around, I'm going to lend a hand to people that need it and try to help them improve as a player too.
---
No...
---
If right: may you be blessed for the rest of your years
---
If wrong: join the long line of shitposters
---
It’s easier of course but it takes longer in most cases and schedules don’t line up or one person has free time and out levels the other one, the whole thing just gets ruined pretty easily, but maybe if you’re going casually or you find someone who’s equally as autistic it can work.
---
Open my settings, turn on all action bars, set all my keybinds that I'm used to from Modern WoW, turn all graphics settings to max, turn on looping music (probably turn up the default volume), turn off error speech.
---
Nothing beats what you knew first. I started in Nov. 2004, the old world was what I knew. When cataclysm hit, that was the new hotness, it was alien and felt manufactured. (Pacing was a big issue too, in vanilla, youd hop back and forth zone to zone to get through it--you spent a lot of time in every zone and could do every quest before you outlevel it--in cataclysm youd do 1/2 a zone and need to move onto the next because you outleveled it)

Sounds like I need to break out my clean underwear and my stabbing shoes. A gentlemen does his best shivving in espadrille's after all.
---
Before WoW, I used to play Tibia. There when you died you lost all the items (including equipped items) you had, you'd have to go back to your corpse to reclaim them, and if it was a player killer then too bad.
---
When I first heard and learnt about WoW, Death didn't sound so bad, and now compared to retail it sounds very harsh.
---
Stay at the old place for a week. Evictions are a very long process and you'll be well within the 30-Day whatever it's called. :D

Oh I will be :)

I think they were midnight back when the media was physical. I remember waiting in line at GameStop for TBC, but I can’t recall if it was midnight or 9:00pm PST. Everyone got home, installed it, and then passed out.
---
I played Shaman in Classic through WOTLK. 
---
Levelling up was amazing. I really don't think any other class feels nearly so complete while levelling, and you really can literally tank, heal or DPS about as well as anyone else in the game if you know what you are doing
---
But to me 60 was super underwhelming. I played a lot of different roles and did a moderate amount of pretty much every activity in the game, but at 60 I was ALWAYS jealous of just about every other class except for Druid. My gripes were:
---
1. to raid it felt like I had to be 31 resto to contribute anything meaningful at all, and even then it just felt like all I was there for was to drop totems.
---
2. When you are resto, solo content of any kind makes you want to gouge your eyes out. Farming was next to impossible.
---
3. Because farming was practically impossible, I ended up re-speccing, A LOT. Sometimes multiple times a week, just so that when it wasn't raid time, I could be having SOME fun at least
---
4. There was a very limited period of time that I felt enhancement was actually fun, and it was before the Windfury nerf to attack power (that I think we'll have the duration of Classic cuz we'll be on 1.12) and using Jeklik's Crusher  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Jeklik%27s\_Crusher](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Jeklik%27s_Crusher) . The wound proc could proc windfury.. which could proc the wound skill.. which could proc windfury. It was really pretty terrible, but the 1/10 pvp engagements where I just walked up to someone and one shot them were AMAZING. 
---
Long story short though, being a shaman I just felt like I had to be resto to be desireable for group play but couldn't do solo content as resto.. and it sucked.

I almost got the classic Stan!
---
Being totally lost is the perfect way to experience WoW for the first time. If you've ever played an MMO or Diablo game before then you should be able to manage fine.
---
The game is paced to let you learn as you go and it's not so difficult that players have to be experts. By the time you reach raids you'll be good enough for them but probably itching to improve.
---
I wouldn't about it all too much until later in the game. Maybe look up individual quests or dungeons if you like.
---
Many players in-game will tell you to google your questions but learning from other players while playing is the best, imo.
---
Immediately start leveling. 
---
Ill fuck with settings on the run from 1-5 zone to Goldshire/Razor Hill.
---
It seems like the people making a big deal of this phase 2 stuff are people that spend all their time in BGs instead of the world of an MMO.

What?! You don't want to be a magnificent Tauren shaman?

But just because I haven't seen this before, are you saying it's better to stand at 9 yards from a raid boss as opposed to 35+ so you can run in for a raptor strike in between auto shots during the time in the cycle aimed and multi are both on CD? Is there anything else more to meleeing during raids than that or is that pretty much it? Haven't player a Hunter at 60 in 12 years so just wondering what you mean by dive/dance. Thanks!

I don’t believe I mentioned anything about them being concerned about what to do with the franchise, just laid out a couple options to address the OP’s questions
---
As you’ve mentioned, the vanilla, TBC, WOTLK route certainly makes sense. I’ll be happy with whatever they choose to do; the sheer fact they’re doing Classic has restored a lot of my faith.
---
Na there's a group of nost players who wanted windfury and mage trinket stacking to be in the preserved state but due to the nature of pservers this wasn't possible. You bet your ass if they could have done it they would have and players would have loved it. Not sure why blizzard can't see or understand this. People wanna relive the OP stuff they remember from the past. Each class/spec had a patch where it was its moment to shine and by only replicating the last patch you're missing out on a lot of awesome moments.

Just gotta kill 49 up. So Ungoro is guna be a shit show.

Maybe an alternate storyline where what if Grom Hellscream was never corrupted by the Burning Legion?
---
Shaman at max level is actually pretty awesome. One of my alts in vanilla was a shaman and I continued to play it to this day. You can burst people down pretty damn fast with lucky crits with both elemental and enhancement spec, but your pve dps is pretty shit. In pve you basically heal and drop totems unless you're lucky and your guild lets you get carried. If you want to be a support player and ENJOY making others shine while you kind of just exist in the background(in raids, pvp is still fun af), shaman is for you.
---
I imagine we will have access to everything the vanilla API would let you do that the modern Legion API also allows. Then everything the Legion API allows that wasnt goin on in vanilla will be removed.   
---
I doubt the zaney shit in vanilla that was removed after vanilla will be allowed.

The serpent sting was from another player, not Luinwe.

Lol I know I’m starting a purely semantic debate, but you could argue it would be like making a classic piece of music with the modern versions of the same instruments...
---
Just flat rate per rank plus talent buff?
---
Yes. It's very small but they do get a bonus.
---
If the pserver trend of an unofficially official honor cap continues in Classic, it's totally doable with a day job. People will probably do that, at least on the major servers. With a reasonable honor cap, you can max out rank progress with like 8h/day or so. You don't need to fully max out to get to 12 or 13.
---
Not to be confused with A L L Y G H O U L
---
Alliance will be equally shafted by ret paladins lol its actually pretty balanced
---
What was that you were saying about money again?
---
Big. Meaty. Macros.
---
If you don't plan to play the alts for a long time then simply spawning in then getting back out should be sufficient. The rested xp will build up slower but if you're not going to touch them for a month or two then it's no difference.
---
Good idea though.

TBC, Wrath Cata were all physical midnight releases for me. In TBC (the entire NA server unlocked at 12am PST, meaning the east coast kids couldnt play till 3am).
---
IIRC their recent games are global digital launches. But that is in the age of cross realm and sharding. If we assume vanilla servers will be at about 2500 as they were in the day, thatd put on average 416.67 players per starting zone if everyone showed up (relatively) at once. Over 400 people in the 1-5 zone would be a nightmare (actually I know it is, its how all pservers launch).
---
Stop being a bitch and just play alliance. /thread
---
Ok apparently I'm wrong they added scaling in late 1.11 which means they should scale in classic keep in mind tho totems get hit by the dot spell power coefficient meaning they don't scale nearly as well as flat damage spells/heals.
---
Hey there! According to some math and testing done by an awesome dude named Jagersmash, as a solo Pally, you can probably expect to get about 2.5 kills/minute consistently when grinding without much downtime. I'm planning to speedlevel a Paladin myself, so I know firsthand the pain of grinding as a Pally. Solo, Paladin is arguably the slowest class to level in the game. You can still get okay-ish times with it, but you're never going to beat a Warlock or Hunter solo.
---
Depending on your goals, if you can find a solid partner with a consistent matching schedule, you may want to consider duo-leveling with another class. It's much faster for the Paladin, and because of the Paladin's excellent utility and healing, it is also faster for just about every other class you could duo with (with a few notable exceptions). A couple of good example Paladin duo compositions are Pally/Lock and Pally/Rogue. This is all of course assuming that you can rely on your partner and have a route planned out, etc. Hope this helps!

The moment someone says brb smoke break in a dungeon is the moment the get replaced.  You have plenty of time to do before / after.

I always hated arenas. I always kind of disliked BGs too, due to their shuffling PvP off into its own little isolated corner of the game, away from the world everything else happened in, but at least they were still somewhat large-scale and balanced around a simple rock, paper, scissors style of play. Arenas totally upended all of that in favor of micro-level twitch based esports. The fact the 2v2 and 3v3 brackets dominated (because of course they did) was just salt in the wound.
---
One of things I'm most excited about getting back to in Classic is that RPS balance and macro-level competition.

Wow this is horrible. Should this be fixed? Or is this a no changes thing? 
---
The one thing I’m having trouble with is how people who raid and obtain tier gear will own the battlegrounds and world pvp, because the PVP epic armor sets are near impossible to get (by the sounds of it) and even the incredibly expensive and time consuming dungeon sets, don’t really compare to the power of the raid tier sets. 
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but it just seems like if you don’t raid, you will have a hard time in PvP.

There must have been tons of just really bad enhancement shamans out there because I had a lot of success with mine back in the day. Rank 12 (almost 13) before honor system changed.
---
Being a miner and enchanter is terrific for those runs, there are 3 nodes guaranteed im a princess run (as far ad private servers go), and the blackstone ring is a unique item, so if you get two rings you can disenchant one and loot one because you cant hold more than one.
---
That's because druids only have one race per faction so it's more skewed - if you look at it overall there's still not as many druids.
---
True but wow doesn't even that many under-used expanses of terrain anymore. Every part of the map has got to serve some purpose and usually so in a boring and predictable way by being sent there as part of a neat circuit from hub to hub.
---
Doesn't matter how remote the area should be to your faction, chances are there'll be settlements and flight paths every stone's throw away and the area will be better settled than vanilla Elwynn ever was.

Not sure if still applies by the time of BFA, but it definitely used to be the case in previous xpacks at least.

---
Are you saying Burning Crusade and Lich King aren’t modern WoW?? They aren’t cancerous?
---
The one piece of advice I would give is to be open-minded in everything. It isn't a difficult game, but the game is not nearly as straight-forward and forgiving as many games out now so be patient and enjoy the experience. I envy that you get to experience this magnificent game for the first time, but the current version of wow does not compare well to the original version. It's not that wow has advanced to a greater state but rather that it regressed to the point of catering to solo and casual players in a way that has made the game mindlessly easy in its current form. The graphics do not compare to anything out now, but in classic everything gained helps enough to be noticeable but not overpowered; just enjoy the unique balance this game provides.
---
Literally 24+ hours for me
---
The TL;DR answer for everthing quest related is as follows:
---
A quest can only be completed in a raid if the quest is marked with the [Raid] tag.
---
Hi, /u/ShoeHoles
---
&gt; Vanilla was built to be a sandbox world
---
I agree with the general thrust of your point, but this statement... no. Just no.
---
One of the main criticisms of the world's design back in the day was how painfully theme-park-y it was. Stand at the border between the Barrens and Ashenvale, for example: you can literally see the line down which the different textures run.
---
I'm not trying to bust your balls here; I actually love the silliness of the different zones being so clearly delineated from one another, it kinda' gives the world extra character. I just can't help but be amused by how time affects how these things are seen.

Invite a healer and three other randoms to my party and knock the starting quest out ASAP.
---
Also if you can afford it never make an alt on the same account. No point as their will be no advantage to having multiple characters on the same account but the massive disadvantage of not being able to be logged into them at the same time.
---
At least he's not going to be doing it with shield discipline as the top talent
---
Log out and make an alt to reserve my next wanted name.
---
Repeat 6 times.
---
Then onto the next server. :)

---
Sooooo...since this link you mention above happens to mention The Burning Crusade, is not at least *possible* that the mechanics of Black Lotus were adjusted in a way that is not identical to vanilla?
---
If it was stun it would stack though, just like the warrior talent does.

You know, I really feel like I was herbing in Un'Goro and got one. Maybe I, too, am am recalling incorrectly.
---
We shall see, my friend.
---
We shall see...
---
O_o
---
Since it depends on the other players on the realm you choose it's not really something that can be answered. The more honor other players bring in each week the more you will have to bring it to get ahead.
---
My experience from vanilla was that casual but regular pvp activity was good up until about Rank 9 or 10. After that it took a more concerted effort to progress. But I also started about a year late...
---
Eh fuck it, I’ll believe it
---
it was just a demo, something to show the fans at blizzcon, it was vastly unfinished in so many areas. I am very sure this will all be fixxed, they have told us over and over they want to make Classic as it was.   
---
So i dont Think this is something that you should worry about.
---
Like the guy says bad at farming, i don’t plan on farming anything but herbs and fish lmao
---
He/she probably meant having only one toon that you level. Of course everyone should have a bank alt regardless. 
---
Anyway you have a good point that you might as well make the alts early on and level in parallel to maximize that rest if you're gonna have alts anyways.

OMG I totally forgot about actually getting INTO the instance back then. Damn that was a good nostalgia wave.
---
I appreciate the offer! However I have to cordially decline as I intend to gank you and your filthy horde brothers for many days to come.
---
I remember rage quiting EQ when I not only lost experience from dying, but actually lost a level. That was infuriating.
---
I felt this energy, on an intimate level
---
You posted this a few days back and we removed it. This is also being removed. I hope you're right, but without evidence, this is worthless.
---
I actually did not post this a few days back. 
---
Nice inaccuracy though.
---
For 5 mans being the warlock is pretty awesome. You're always basically the last one there since you can summon everyone so dungeons start on YOUR time. Fuck playing a warlock in raids, though.
---
My sides

different macros.

There was one floating around that changed the camera and zoom and there was one that changed clutter density and stuff like that. The second one included a line for draw distance, iirc. It's been a long time...
---
&gt;killing lowbies helps your faction.
---
It just encourages retaliatory attacks on lowbies of the other faction. Which ends up hurting new players/alts in your faction.

Now you're in a dungeon with 4 people who think you're annoying and needy.

As long as it runs as well as the old client I don't really care. The performance on retail is horrendous.

Totems don't scale off of Spell Power much even after the 1.11 change however.this doesn't mean they should be ignored.

Never died in Krater of ungoru?
---
That depends on if Original mounts are in effect/on timer.
---
Because Southshore quests are higher than Tauren Mill..?
---
Your reply is needlessly toxic.
---
If you spend money having fun its never wasted right? Its about having fun while you play. Then maybe, well actually for sure, it will be dead one day but you will have had a ton of fun. That is what a game is about right
---
They'll use 1.12 data. Whatever in that will be in Classic.
---
I said in another thread: the single greatest sin an MMO (or any game meant to have an expansive and immersive world) can commit for me is unlimited instant/fast travel. Sure, it's more convenient to be able to be able to teleport to any zone from anywhere, but it completely kills any sense of immersion and makes this great big world you've crafted feel about as expansive as my living room.
---
The fact instant travel in WoW is largely restricted to one class and fast travel still requires you move through the world to get anywhere is one of the things I'm most looking forward to in Classic. For the first time in 12 years I'm going to feel like the game world is an actual *world* again.
---
I can't freaking wait.
---
Haha wow, such trashtalk!
---
I wonder how many people even watched the show
---
Smoke my cigar and quietly utter "Hell, it's about time"
---
That’s the spirit!
---
Shaman (enhancement) is one of the most fun classes to level, especially in later expansions they really come into their own and get so many fun tools. Endgame is not nearly as fun as questing though.
---
Great. That's more wpvp and the cycle of faction hate continues.
---
Training skills and getting new skills in general also feels really good. Its nice to look forward to certain levels and feeling much more powerful after you visit the trainer!
---
I kind of hope that newcomers drop that perfection-or-bust attitude after they die from 2 kobolds in Elwynn.
---
I like this.
---
Cross realm BG's ruined PvP for me. I missed the rivalries and recognizing players. 
---
Queues were never bad in vanilla wow even on a lower population server (daggerspine-us) but I could see taht being an issue.
---
Private servers are kinda weird and dont really reflect the general wow population. If the server isn't fresh then most ppl are probably done pvping already
---
It’s from South Park
---
It doesn’t have to do with being so hardcore that you break the rules. It’s just wanting to play the game. If it wasn’t for Nostalrius, we probably wouldn’t even be talking about Classic now, also.
---
There will be sharding in the starting zones to stop the "madness"
---
I think deep down we all want this to happen. But the sad reality of modern snowflake gamers will prevent it.
---
as a former serious raider in vanilla i revel in the fact that theres no expire date this time on version were playing. We were just started to progress on Naxx back then when TBC came and made everyone move on.
---
Cant wait to just chill this time and socialize with the right kinda ppl.
---
Nope, thats lore that goes back to the RTS, Arthas using frostmourne to kill Mal'ganis so that his "soul" couldn't escape back to the nether is one example that springs to mind.
---
I can’t do that yet. 
---
I can’t do that yet.
---
Can you still use the insignia if you drop BS?
---
I guess I was being a bit hyperbolic there. Just found the implication that private servers would have increased drop rates on low level grey items of all things a bit ridiculous. Very strange jab to make when private servers have perfectly valid issues to critique.
---
&gt;These zones will all be camped 16+ hours/day, for however many days a week it takes to get Bracket 1 RP (The most amount of RP you can earn in a given week) Generally speaking these players will be the try hard no lifers, who will:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\-Be level 60 in a week or so  
---
&gt;\-Have epic mounts within a couple of weeks of hitting 60  
---
&gt;\-Leveled engineering to PvP better in the open world  
---
&gt;\-PvP consumables at all times for their gank squads  
---
&gt;\-Been clearing Molten Core since week 2 of launch, so vastly outgearing the majority of players  
---
&gt;\-Generally private server players, who will have been playing Vanilla for years and will be generally\* more skilled at Vanilla, understanding the meta, mechanics, etc.  
---
&gt;All of these factors combined are going to make it extremely difficult for anyone on even a slightly more casual gaming schedule to compete at all in open world PvP unless you vastly out number them. Even if you kill them once or twice, once your group moves on they will be back to hard camping everyone they possibly can for honor. It's going to be a very frustrating experience for anyone in these zones actively trying to accomplish anything, whether you're still leveling at this point in the server, or a level 60 who's trying to farm. 
---
Pretty sure someone would have mentioned this, but Pservers are not Blizzard servers. 
---
Pservers: 
---
* High (stupid high) population for one server.
---
   * The World was never intended to have that many people online at a time.
---
   * Multiple servers over different regions will divide the Pserver player-base and community (those that are NA and played with EU guilds will not want high ping so will roll on NA servers). So the true amount of 'bored/pvp farming/gank squading' players that are fully gear out will be limited. Plus many of the Pserver community will want to play on the same servers.
---
* 'tryhards/nolifers/min/maxers' 
---
   * While the majority on Pservers, they will be the minority in Classic. Players from Retail will jump on and oof throughout (many won't return, or will come back at the new Phases). Those returning players who did not play Pservers, probably won't have the same time, but have the skills and will join up with other semi-casual players. These players are dedicated to get to 60 and complete the PvE content.
---
   * Many people will play limited hours, but still be able to accomplish the same goals (PvE). I imagine a return to Classic (Vanilla) style of gameplay. Sure, min/maxing will be a thing. But, it wasn't like it didn't exist, it slowly started with BWL and continued into TBC and grew from there.  
---
I just don't see it being as bad as the Pserver players want us to believe it to be. It's sounds like a scare tactic to get Blizzard attention... *'You better release WSG in P2 because if you don't all of us Pserver players are going to 'nolife' and 'gank squad' everyone and only other Pserver players will ever get to 60 and we will be in BiS within two weeks of launch and we will camp and 'honor farm' all the the casuals and the casuals will hate it and leave the game forever....'*
---
\*\*(Note: I have nothing against Pserver players. I think that, while there will always be ganking or groups of gankers farming honor, there will be a balance because of the smaller server sizes and larger player base with the majority being casual/semi-casual.)
---
On another note, I also purposed a Phase 2.5 in another post: Where P2.5 is the Battlegrounds Patch (1.5) with both WSG and AV. Timing wise it works perfectly. Phase 1 will be 4-5 months and Phase 2 will be 1-2 months. Add in Phase 2.5 a month after P2 and then a month later release Phase 3 with BWL. That will take us to 6 months which is right around the time when BWL should be released.  Having only 1 month of Honor System without BGs will be fine, just get rid of the DKs for that first month also.
---
The Zorum Strand corpse run from felwood can be fun too.
---
thanks for the effort, I don't want to admit that this yellow shitpost touched my heart but it did.
---
Instantly spam World/LFG and General chat with ANAL, [Dirge], and [Thunderfury] spam.
---
I know of that one, but doesn't feel like it's quite what I'm looking for :/
---
Kinda late here, but how does dungeons work without multiple specs, can i heal if im leveling cat or anything like that?
---
I agree it’s a good feeling in game. it’s just getting overblown on this sub as a common refrain. 
---
“DAE remember getting your first gray shoulders??”
---
Zorum Strand is where I died. So it is most likely you used the GY in Astranaar
---
😂😂 💀
---
Better to just solo/duo farm. If multiboxing Strat live and Scholo farming is potentially strong.
---
Why are you looking to fill the guild coffers anyways? Every guild I have raided with runs under the expectation of self reliance, with some members more then happy to sell consumables.
---
100000x this
---
If you go Ele/Resto in Battlegrounds you are just that - A caster with insane burst, and off-healing. One of the few true 'hybrid' specs because you can Damage/Heal at the same time.
---
The Blood Elf zones were in their own separate server. It's why you phase when you travel there. Possibly part of outland somehow?
---
Don't know what to tell you then. AFAIK that's the only accurate site for vanilla drops.
---
Good point. I think they capped the servers at those sizes for hardware reasons initially. Not sure if it was calculated around creating small town feel. 
---
Plus there were plenty of toxic people as I remember. Once you’re in an established guild you don’t really need to be nice to anyone else, except maybe other top guilds just in case you want to lateral.
---
That epic bow quest was so much fun. I remember being so nervous and watching video after video on how to do each fight. Truly felt epic.
---
Back in the day I felt like every NE hunter was called Drizzt
---
Try this. Hop over to staysafe’s stream and tell me if you enjoy it.
---
Yeah that must be it.
---
You can get 12 for sure, probably 13. Might take 3-4 months.
---
Cataclysm wasn't bad, a comedown from WOTLK but that expansion and TBC were so good that they are tough acts to follow
---
Yes but 1-10 is like a couple of hours. Maybe 5-6 IIRC? Who cares if 7-10 sucks if it takes an hour.
---
Most specs in vanilla are viable but not optimal 
---
Ret Paladin is just straight up ass
---
Fire totems damage scale slightly on SP, as well as healing stream totem (searing and stream coef are like 0.11 SP per "tick" while magma and fire nova are ~.48?)
---
The other stat based or mechanical totems do not scale. Mana stream only scales with spell levels and talents, while Mana Tide does not scale at all outside levels.
---
I love how Ghouls and Gnolls were the first models finalized. It's so interesting to see the pre-alpha human model along with ground textures, along the Ghoul model that kept with us all the way to WotLK.
---
Imagine STV when the first wave hits 30. I can't wait.
---
&gt; The other problem is lack of CC which is a real big problem in Vanilla. 
---
This should not be understated. How much dps you do isn't the point. modern min-maxers are going into vanilla which is not a min-max game. The dps is largly irrelevant early endgame.  But not having CC is huge. If a ret paladin takes the spot of a mage, good luck clearing a dungeon.
---
Step 1: Make a Troll Paladin
---
Step 2: Go to Barrens
---
Step 3: Make Chuck Norris and Mankriks wife jokes
---
Step 4: ???
---
Step 5: Profit
---
Totally this!
---
FD in PVP is more about your opponent losing target. It'll interrupt casts and help you blend into a large group if you're being focused.
---
Yup.
---
Ok we're getting into weird territory here because consumables are incredibly strong if used in the right situations but also expensive. Warriors are vulnerable to potions/elixiers like LIP/Stoneshield etc. If I see a Warrior pop a FAP right off the bat, ill just run away or use something defensive until it wears off, because in solo wPvP there is no pressure to fight. You can almost always just run/juke, especially vs. a Warrior. Classes with offensive dispell (Priest, Warrior, Warlock, Shaman) can just remove it though.
---
If you want to pop a FAP for a random wPvP encounter, then sure. I use those to get WS flags or for more important group vs group encounters. In solo wPvP I mostly just use cheap health/mana potions and maybe a tender wolf steak. But it depends on the situation. Maybe there is something valuable that we're fighting over, then it is a totally different story.
---
The above list is a generalisation though. Utility consumables can really make a worlds difference.
---
&gt; The zones were also much easier and generally you had outleveled them well before you had finished the story in each zine.
---
This has somewhat been 'fixed' now with level scaling.  It gets annoying at times (did STV a couple days ago, and going back to the camps with the panthers running around is annoying.  You used to be higher level than them when you were doing the later quests so they wouldnt annoy you, now theyre always your level), but overall its really, really nice to be able to not only do an entire zone, but multiple zones back to back that tie into each other.
---
I dunno why people complain so much about rejuv not stacking, in my guild we had healers who were told to focus on different groups, so multiple Druids shouldn't be all on the same target unless the main tank is getting rekt
---
classic wow bout to kill old school runescape all over again (F)
---
"Owner" is such a fantastic name.
---
Ffxiv had a tier like that in A Realm Reborn. Dropped the same loot that the regular difficulty did but was tuned any harder and rewarded a title for each boss. Still one of my proudest MMO accomplishments.
---
Right
---
You can tank everything just fine as fury or arms just throw on a 1h and shield.
---
My mana is spent
---
Someone should build an online Atlas Loot!
---
I'm sure HTML5 could allow for it.
---
For a skilled hunter, you are correct. Less skilled hunters will try the old "just pretend I'm dead" trick which does not work, which I am pointing out.
---
Yeah wanting a guy to utilize a unique skill granted to him in order too benefit the entire group is a huge pain am I right?
---
Most of my friends were just tourists.
---
"Hey, man, how's  WoW treating ya?"
---
"WoW? That's old. I've moved on to Team Fortress 2."
---
I wasn't a gamer in high school so this tourist shit among all my friends pissed me off.
---
have you ever played any MMORPG before or wow willbe the first one?
---
What special zone are they referring to that requires multiple people to open the portal? Guess it never made it in.
---
I considered that as the first thing.  But I really cant’ stand Not Enough Mana.
---
Sharding is the madness. He wants to play real vanilla wow.
---
Correct. 380 is a decent defense to aim for pre R-bis. Armor is undervalued by many people, 2 piece valor is highly recommended, as well as rings/trinkets with armor.
---
Be careful with the blues that only have armor and defense, if you're too low on HP it wont matter. As a tauren warrior you can easily get those legs with extra armor and 15 def from BRD, as well as the extra armor/defense shoulders from scholomance, and still be fine on HP.
---
Says requires 225 blacksmithing so I'd assume no.
---
I had to struggle to completely disconnect but the desire hit me strong in January. Been here checking forums daily since.
---
Not in Vanilla.
---
I played a bunch of elder scrolls online and old school runescape
---
It doesn’t have a function to list Dungeon bosses. The best you can do is find that list elsewhere and search each in ClassicDB.
---
Like, do you like Dark Souls? Because you will face similar amounts of frustration.
---
It's possible.  That's why I ask everyone who says it's different to provide a source.  I'll be here waiting patiently.
---
Then do all the keybinds.
---
Yeah, fair point!
---
The way we are running it is a mixture of loot council and dkp. But the dkp will be used for benefits and off spec/minor items which are a buff but easily replaceable. You will build up dkp not just the participation in raids but through guild help such as summoning, food, prompt timing, coming fully prepped, maxing applicable professions, recruitment, dungeon runs for lowbies/60 pre-bis, pvp etc (just general guild group/raid participation and activity etc) these dkp can then be transferred based on the weekly exchange rate for guild gold and mats. So for example if you are an active hardcore raider etc but 1 week you want to just take break from the mat grind. You can use your earned dkp for guild gold and mats etc. It will hopefully provide a safety net for grind burnout plus incentivise activity and participation off non raid orientated group content.
---
Lmao
---
Does armor affect Windfury?
---
Then they aren't going to pvp either. They will be dominated by everyone who has raid gear, so what else are they going to do, mine ore for 8 hours? Just go play Runescape at that point, at least they give you a cape.
---
Pure health will prevent being one shot. War and pala gear typically has more stamina than mail leather cloth etc.
---
And it takes up a debuff slot that could have been used for something like Corruption (which does scale)
---

---
On private servers you can't reflect mid air spells have to use it just before. But you can definitely vanish mid air spells or use skull of impending on rocket helm when you see him charging you. Hard to tell how it will be in classic.
---
It's going to be removed after a few weeks from launch. If you don't want to play Classic out of spite even after it's removed I don't know what to tell you.
---
Oh didn't know they fixed that! That's awesome! I haven't played retail in years so my information might be outdated 😋
---
God im so sick of waiting
---
Competitive viability for enhance no longer exists. Yes they could do well in real vanilla. Pservers have shown that enhance is awful vs competent players and are basically a meme. No, unfortunately Classic will not change that
---
Lol nobody says that in this game.
---
No private server has spell batching so there's no corelation here.
---
been posted a dozen times at least.
---
I wonder if you can cheese the boss in Classic the same way you can on private servers. By having everyone except the maintank pop Barov Peasant callers at 30% you can summon 117 Servant of Barov that will sit there and soak up the poison bolts while the raid can burn the boss down. No NR gear required.
---
It was a fairly recent change.
---
In all honesty, the exact moment you speak of is what I had in mind when I made this meme. I imagined this was a human mage after getting ganked mercilessly.
---
You can list all the bosses in a dungeon by doing like this. Not as convenient as atlas bit still : http://classicdb.ch/?npcs&amp;filter=zone=[2100];#0-2+1
---
Anyone recall a video almost in the same vein as this, way less humor but took place in the plague lands about a group of paladins?
---
It wouldn't be that hard! My thought would be how much better it would be if there was also a 3D character model to view what an item looks like. That would probably require something like WebGL which is a tad bit more complicated.
---
Bad idea. Dispelling the poison cause a large amount of damage. You never want to have dispels you cant control on that fight as it will get people killed.
---
Guess that will have to do. Thanks
---
Your post is exactly how I remember rejuve working as well.
---
They do. It's just not working 100% like it should, only blizzard knows how it is exactly thats why it's hard to tell right now. We just have to wait.
---
red quests = roll hunter.
---
That’s normal in Vanilla ^^
---
It is actually lol
---
“Don’t count on dynamic respawns being a thing in classic”
---
Can we steal the Flash/Java from that website that has the "View in 3D" button?
---
Not sure which one it is: Every time I Google a vanilla WoW object, it's a different site. I usually click VanillaDB if I see it. Otherwise I never pay attention.
---
Speaking of: What happened to thottbot?
---
arcane is fine, pom sheep negates trinket and then its all ogre for the warrior. Fire is the spec that if the warrior trinkets your frost nova and pummels polymorph your only chance is an impact proc into polymorph.
---
You said it!
---
Well.. 18/6 split.. 4 days x 18 hours = 3 days of playtime.  
---
You'll probably need atleast 6\~ days total "4,5 days of playtime".. that's if you're one of the fastest alive to level that is.. so you'll probably need about 8-10 days minimum to get to 60.
---
Lol what? Why???
---
Same reason Rare did such a fantastic job with Goldeneye64. Still one of the greatest shooters of all time next to Quake III Arena. ^^^(sips Monster Zero)
---
Another one was [linked item] in my butt
---
just play a horde warrior honestly
---
Good
---
Talents don't matter much for healing in dungeons. So you don't need to respec even if you're leveling as feral. You do want to make sure you have some healing gear though. Especially int gear so you have enough mana. Just make sure you save the best int/spirit gear you can find while leveling and save in the bank. Just switch to that for healing.
---
I'd love to see an illustrated version like the maps currently in BFA but without the changes that are not in Classic.
---
Yeah having it take over every thought and spare minute isn’t healthy haha. I’ll be a filthy casual, and find with it.
---
Put Paul Stanley - Live to Win on loop and grind boars.
---
Last two expansions dropped in August, and I’m looking at Classic to be in the same boat.  I’ll pick August 20 as the date.  Far enough from 8.2 to not compete and close enough to still be in the summer.
---
Thanks man. I appreciate you uploading your 1-10 run I enjoyed watching and learning
---
While I agree with almost all of your comment, nothing beats the burst of a pyro mage. Period. It's a cooldown driven spec but instant pyroblast &gt; all for burst.
---
Works best as Alliance when you can MC people off the cliff in Felwood as they land on the FP and send them on a 10 minute corpserun back from Darkshore.
---
No. 4 months a piece. That's the best.
---
It needs to be reposted as the sub grows, every time it's seen by new members the list will grow and become more useful
---
Num Lock for autorun.
---
Start running, I can configure settings on my way to get my first quest and tag my first mob, or while autoattacking.
---
5 Stacks with the proper gear and consumes can get up to 7-8k damage. Its pretty fucking insane.
---
I think you have Phase 1 being too long. Maybe like 2-3 months
---
I also see Phase 2 and 3 being slightly longer than what you have
---
I’m just doing Reddit, am I doing it wrong?
---
Grab quest and start fighting for mobs. Set up UI basics while running to them. When I have 20 seconds to auto run, set up my usual key bind. (QE R T F G Z X C V). 
---
Keep killing mobs.
---
Playing real vanilla wow means massive queue times and servers that are on fire. So arguably he is getting the most accurate experience by not playing the game. This may be a crazy concept, but I'm going to take the classic wow team at their word until they do something untrustworthy. If they say they only want to shard for a few weeks, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Call it naive, I call it optimistic.
---
That's what i meant
---
&gt; the 1 person who gets the good gear
---
Okay ignoring the fact that you think this is primarily about R14 gear, which it isn't, you do realize you get a few new R14s per month, right? PvP ranks are introduced in phase two, and the R14 gear is good even by AQ standards which is released in phase _five_, which is probably going to be more than half a year later?
---
I love shaman oddly enough second class made first to 60 then my hunter which was first made.
---
I mostly only played during BC (Shaman) but thinking about trying classic when it comes around and leaning towards being a huntard.
---
I have no problem trying to min-max, but I'll probably only be able to play 30-40 minutes per day - so Hunter seems to be well suited for that (easy soloing / farming) 
---
Once I eventually hit 60 I'll probably Battleground more than raid (due to said time limits). 
---
Do you think hunter is reasonable for my situation? Seems like they'd do decent without amazing gear.
---
I still play on my lowbie rogue, have a little fun ganking around in red ridge. But I honestly have zero desire to play anyone else, since all progress will be wasted. 
---
The content is fun on its own, but progression is such an important peice of the puzzle, and the game feels just a little bit emptier for it.
---
Did you read the part where i said pick 2 of the obove?
---
This is far too low-effort. It doesn’t even make sense in the context of the original meme.
---
Its after getting dismounted from some of the add's mind flays in AQ, and in BWL can't mount.
---
I think it’s blown entirely out of proportion. Are they the best spec? Certainly not. But as someone who did quite well with an enhancement shaman during Vanilla it’s not nearly as horrendous as people make it out to be. PvP is all about burst damage and while you are entirely reliant on WF procs, you’ll destroy a lot of cloth geared players. 
---
But regardless it’s one of the most fun specs out there in my opinion. Individual player skills range incredibly so I wouldn’t rely so much on private server “data”.
---
I'm pretty sure they will push phase 1 for at least 6 months, maybe even more considering the fact that it's the release phase and people have to level/gear/enjoy the classic content for the first time since 2006. After that it SHOULD be 4-5 months for each phase.
---
Sounds perfect for what you are looking for, hunters are the fastest levelers and are amazing in PVP.
---
They could get holy shock. Sure it was only 20 yards but it's still a ranged pull. 
---
Also exorcism if you're fighting undead.
---
What's an alt?
---
Think we just found the Ret pally lol.
---
It was dank
---
Yeah definitely early August. That's when I leave for Europe for 6 weeks so most likely the game will come out the day I leave.
---
I'm going to be so choked if I miss launch day. Only get to do that once every 15 years.
---
Jaedenar needs one of these
---
I don't think you need to start out 30 hours straight unless you are going server-first for 60.
---
If you get to 60 within 2 weeks you already be bleeding edge on the server. At 10-hour days, that's 140 hours to 60 which seems about right for most hardcore levelers.
---
There's going to be no difference between hitting 60 ten days after release vs 14 days until you are trying to raid before the second reset.
---
Sorry meant burning steepes. Was tired.

Omg plZ

Blizzard confirmed old spell batching will be in classic.

I would lose it in a good way. Call in sick immediately
---
Shamans are really really complex to play in PvE compared to a lot of other classes though. You are only seeing the healing. But totem placement is a HUGE thing that seperates good and bad shamans.
---
Playing an enh shaman on a TBC server right now and I can confirm it's fucking beast mode
---
The joke is that hunters can't use maces.
---
This has been posted a bunch, and we tend to remove it if it's reposted too frequently, but the last time I'm aware that it was posted and not removed was over two weeks ago, so we're letting it go this time. Trying to strike a balance between letting something get spammed and letting new faces see potentially useful tools/resources.

I'll hit 60 on the 6th day with under 5 days /played, no doubt
---
My opinion is that its difficult for people to put something away that they've put 10+ years of effort and attachment into.
---
No matter how bad it gets people will still play.
---
yea, but at that point bring a holy pally instead of a ret
---
nah this was just really bad effort
---
See we can only take at maximum 7 days off, which means even if we get lucky and the release falls on a Friday at midnight, then the maximum we can get is 10 days. Which if you are saying 140 hours to 60, that'd give us 100 hours of sleep in 10 days. 
---
Which is more than we get on deployment some weeks so shouldn't be too much of a sweat.

BFA was worldwide release and seemed to go really well.

I could see Classic doing the same thing.
---
Are you familiar with the 8 playable races?  They are divided into two opposing factions.
---
The Horde is made up of Undead, Tauren, Troll, and Orc.
---
The Alliance is made up of Human, Dwarf, Gnome, and Night Elf.
---
Human and Undead starting zones are night and day.
---
Orc/Troll and Gnome/Dwarf starting zones are also opposites.
---
Again, Tauren and Night Elf starting zones are pretty dissimilar.
---
I suggest you play the aesthetic that appeals to you as it will be all you see for the first few hours of the game.
---
Do you know about the playable classes?  Do you have a favorite?
---
There exist 9 classes in this game.  Seven classes can be played by both Horde and Alliance members.  The remaining classes are restricted to one side or the other.
---
Every class is effective in combat.
---
Mage, Warlock, Hunter, Rogue excel in combat.
---
Warrior, Paladin, Druid, Shaman, and Priest are capable combatants, but they are also proficient in healing or tanking or both!
---
A lot of people theorize about what makes some things better than others.  They are probably right, but the most important aspect of playing a video game is to have fun.
---

Dustwallow Marsh looks like a dragon.
---
Can't forget the token nightfall bot. "Go auto attack the boss and afk."
---
I played on one shortly after the classic hype spiked up again and played with some like-minded people.  While the dungeon was tough, we all still had a good time.
---
Depends on who you get lumped in with.
---
This entirely depends on how quickly the community forms, when the tourists leave, who is left and how quickly they progress.
---
Nobody can say.
---
Warriors and rogues are top DPS in the first tier, hunters hang out just above mages on the dps charts at that point. By BWL they are below mages, they don't see a huge decline, but they certainly don't see the massive power spike the other classes do around this point.
---
Hey, you know that every weapon is a hunter weapon. Even if for nothing but vendor bait. After all, they need that gold to buy ammo.
---
If I remember correctly it was because of stability and security. The old client had a lot of security holes in it and couldn't work with Battle.net. 
---
Apparently it still feels like vanilla though according to the people that played the demo.
---
It's funny how rabid some of these #NoChanges people are yet they want to change the mindset and general attitude of vanilla most of all...
---
Ah I got you. You don't want to see it evolve into something it wasn't meant to be.
---
Boooo
---
Pretty much this. Use the current syntax, disallow what wasn't available or allowed in Vanilla via access to APIs.
---
mfw filthy casuals who don't have their keybinds pre-set out on a .txt file so they can go into the game files find the keybinding folder and copy paste into your character's keybinding settings think they know stuff
---
Yeah, I want more people from old stormreaver to sign up.
---
Oh god I’m so hyped right now !
---
Yeah dude no changes let’s make the servers unplayable for 3 weeks after launch while we are at it.
---
I'm just starting to get into D&amp;D, I start my first campaign on Sunday. What's the deal with Drizzt? (I think that's a D&amp;D thing, right?)
---
**Bind Toggle-Auto Run to Middle Click**
---
Ashkandi.
---
Probably Zin'Rokh out of those 2 though, slower speed. Less base damage, but more AP on it as well.
---
Dibs!
---
"/1 Hey guys, what's that orange weapon people always link again?"
---
Factually incorrect, but dont let that take away from your memes.
---
Always bring a ret so you know what dps needs to get kicked
---
Don't forget to blow blood-lust at the wrong step too.
---
A lot of people don't care about HKs, they just want to kill lowbies.
---
Can't say I've had the same experience on private servers.  
---
I agree with you though, hope classic will be laid back and friendly, a big majority of the players are definitely going to be first timers.
---
But that is a hunter sword! In fact so is zin'rokh!
---
Game is based on 1.12. all of that was fixed before 1.12, so they most likely aren't going to introduce game-breaking things like that again
---
I totally agree. I think some of the issue us different continents. I think the best wow and where I would like to see classic. Is keep level cap at 60 and redo places like hyjal and uldum and the karazhan zone. Keep it on the same continent and no flying. This is a couple years down the road. But imagine Kara being the highest tier for a bit. One of my favorite raids. Maybe 40 Man.
---
All the gameplay systems like talents are going to be in their final 1.12 state, no reason to assume any of those you mentioned to be progressive release.
---
Those people will be around long before and after phase two though, they aren't my concern.
---
I think it gets rightfully overshadowed by Nemesis and Tiers 4, 5, 6
---
The effort is that he made the meme. I could see not liking the meme content but, this is standard layout for this meme. I guess he could have added. Why won't anyone play in groups with me. seems unnecessary though. Either way it's clearly just a ret pally shit post lol.
---
It looks good, though really shows how ugly that world is lol.

I totally forgot about it until last week. Reminded myself that it’s almost SUMMER OF 2019! Got PUMPED again!
---
But I have a career, wife, and kids, so I gotta control myself this time.

Thanks for giving new people a chance to find this info
---
warriors have about 2 openings to beat mages when they are using a free action potion. if they miss those, they die. and thats assuming the mage isn't running pom and they don't get a polymorph off on you before you can lock em down
---
Hunter is strong 1-10. Just note between autoshots.
---
you can certainly measure the potential of classes. If you put skill in then the answer is the person with the highest skill, which isn't constructive or unknown at all. Certain matchups are certainly favorable and unfavorable, which is what JHoneyBadgerS is asking for. I don't understand why you commented this.
---
Is this only EU?
---
well obviously ashkandi is best.... lol
---
Really? isn't its DPS lower too?
---
Gotta be going Troll then, right?
---
Taran icebreaker was a level 52 weapon.
---
Druid 1-20 is cancerous
---
Man. I wish someone made a graphics slider for SMB3. No way I can enjoy that game looking like it did in 1990. Trash.
---
Looks like I'll just have to stick with playing the Unreal Engine port someone made. /s
---
I could be wrong but I think, 40 second sheeps should still  be the norm.
---
19th may here!
---
Same!
---
Yep. I feel like they probably have an internal release date they are planning for (maybe july 16) but if they have to go past it they don't want to disappoint the whole fanbase and betray their trust by not keeping their word OR being forced to release it unfinished
---
In all honesty, that's probably how it will play out for the *horde*, because hunters and shaman will be sharing loot tables come AQ. The alliance only have 1 class that can use mail items, however--the hunter!
---
So if you are a guild on the alliance side, you'll want a few hunters to absorb that mail gear so that you don't have wasted loot as often. Maybe only 3-4, but that's still enough to be considered a good representation of the class, imo. Just my 2 cents!
---
‘Soon’
---
Don't forget you can MC mobs in lbrs to gain 80 RF
---
Uhh yeah but this really isnt even standard layout. It barely makes sense. It even misses the question, and why does it change from pala to retri pala?
---
Private server costs are not what retail. Just saying.
---
No it has a US / EU section
---
TIL you could turn this off, been playing since vanilla...
---
No shit, sherlock. Just saying.
---
Was basically going to say what the other guy said.
---
I mean, yeah, if you want to go join a guild, heal all throughout the tiers, and get caster gear that is most likely prioritized to go to practically anyone *but* you... to finally go back, overgeared, to dead content as ele... You'll probably do absolutely splendid compared to people in crap gear.
---
You would also, still, be infinitely more useful to the group playing a healer spec and maybe dropping a healer or two to bring in better dps, if the tank is geared enough for them to actually hit the boss a bit (at least rogues and hunters can reset their threat then).
---
I just think it's such a dead discussion, like why? None of that makes it a fine DPS spec, it's just fucking around in dead content with way too much gear and time invested. You can do it if you want to, but that doesn't make it a fine DPS spec, it just means there were no better option to bring.
---
Telling people on here, that may never even have played vanilla, or at least not since it was current, that it's fine to expect to roll a ele shaman and do some sick DPS, just feels dishonest.
---
In practice they are healer classes, and both are extremely useful in that role. That you can do anything else is a novelty...
---
&gt;horde
---
&gt;losing any bg besides av
---
Grizzly being fucking assholes every given opportunity? I am genuinely shocked.
---
See you in STVietnam
---
Haha no yeah I'm used to it
---
Theres no room for logic in memes
---
how do you turn off error speech:d
---
You have not established, for a fact that 4 hunters would be able to keep the uptime to ''close to 100%''. As far as i know, the proc rate on private servers is fictitious. Made up.
---
Bro troll shamans are sick, I really love how the shaman gear looks on them and they always looked sick with a shield on.
---
"LFM BRD ironfoe on res. come to IF bridge for gear inspection"
---
"hey guys can someone Plz inv me to asmongolds guild"
---
"CUCKCUCKCUCK. IM GONNA BITCH ABOUT POLITICS IN A VIDEOGAME"
---
Zin'Rokh is a hunter weapon! Don't mind me. Still salty that I lost the roll to our main tank that never respecced dps.
---
xD
---
Dead Man's Trail... Yup. Also being smack dab between the 2 spirit healers makes for a Looonnnnng run back
---
Yeah, In 1.12 sheep is probably the most broken ability
---
And my server had some dominant enhancement shamans. I think like 3 of our first four HWLs were enhancement shamans; the first was a warrior.
---
That link is broken for me. SQL error.
---
Great screenshots there buddy! It's like I'm really there!
---
it says its processing?
---
So if you take that talent and are an Orc you've an even higher chance to resist stuns, correct?
---
So [the formula](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_power) to calculate how ap affects weapon daamge is this one:
---
Average Damage per swing = (Weapon DPS + AP/14) * Weapon Speed. 
---
Zin'Rokh = (64.6 +72/14) * 3.8 = 265
---
Spinal reaver = (74.7 +34/14) * 3.4 = 262.2
---
So Zin'rokh hits harder.. and has stamina, so zin'rokh is better for sure. Sword spec is also better with better gear. since crit is dimishes in value. each next crit gives less.
---
nice
---
to be fair, private servers are pretty close to the real thing. like its 98% vanilla
---
Thank you sir
---
&gt; stuck healing
---
You mean single-handedly deciding PvP skirmishes because nobody else thinks healing is as cool as doing damage?
---
Battle for Azeroth goes Bankrupt! made me chuckle. 
---
10 million classic players would indeed be amazing.
---
In the audio options where you can check what you want to hear or don’t want to hear.   There’s an option for error speech.  That’s what you want.
---
Pour a scotch, group up with the nearest warrior and heal them while we quest.
---
tnx!
---
It might be, but I don't think that takes your stats into consideration, nor the AP on the weapon. That's just based on the min/max damage and weapon speed. The slower weapon with slightly less max damage but nearly double the AP stat will do more big hits. Maybe I'm just thinking PVP though. Not sure how the PVE dps numbers work out
---
I'm a total fucking loser with zero friends, lets hit it brother.
---
Alliance have no quests in hillsbrad until 30. You can pick them up sooner but you’ll get your ass kicked.
---
Sheep is 12 second then 6 then 3 then inmune
---
Sunken Temple.
---
The dungeon takes forever to clear, one wrong pull can mean a wipe, Eranikus is also a level 55 boss with a 15 sleep to a random person, has thrash that gives 2 extra attacks and also war stomp which stuns for 5sec, if he sleep the tank or healer is 100% a wipe. Even with 60s on your group it can be hard to kill him based on RNG.
---
Definitely C. Not only should you shut up and play ret, you should shut up and enjoy it was well 🤗
---
That UI is something else. Def vanilla. Nice screenshot!
---
You mean hearing “I CANT CAST THAT YET I CANT DO THAT I CANT CAST THAT YET” isn’t fun to you? :)
---
Personally, I’m going to activate my action bars, set up very minor key bindings. Probably level to 5 or 6, and go visit Stormwind to see some (hopefully) unsharded madness.
---
52 item level, 47 level requirement according to wowhead. But I think it changed because it now has a speed of 3.6 and it definitely used to be the fastest 2h I’ve ever seen.
---
The top is 2/3 of my wife
---
Due to the high randomness in the game, it requires a LOT of test dummy time before you can get reliable numbers. It's even harder for rogues and warriors where your rotation can get messed up if you don't have enough energy/rage to do moves because of missed attacks.
---
Yes an orc warrior can have 45% stun resist. You'd have to do some weird prot pvp build though so really the only point is for the lolz to duel rogues.
---
So which would would you say is better for a beginner?
---
If it ends up being sharded past the 1-10 zones, I’ll seriously consider taking a breather from the game for a few weeks until sharding is gone. 
---
I can handle 4 hours of gameplay like that, but anything past that is too much.
---
No the goat is dispel magic. It puts a damper on pretty much all the most frustrating shenanigans. I think sheep is up there.
---
Kool beans this has not been the case on most private servers I have been on. Glad to see hell sheep will not be in classic.
---
Hunters are... okay in the first tier, but even once people are pre-raid BiS you're going to start falling behind the mages/rogues, and the warriors will already be way ahead of you. They fall behind warlocks eventually, but are still better than meme specs and you need them for utility anyway so they never fully "drop off".
---
I'm talking about Hunter, not Warrior.
---
Psh, 315 fire rez for Rag is a fucking myth that wont die.

1.12 versions from the time they're available:
---
&gt;Since we broke down the [six phases](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346/1) of content that we’ll be rolling out for Classic, we’ve heard the increase in requests for PvP details so we wanted to get you up to speed on our plans there.  
---
&gt;As was the case when World of Warcraft originally launched in 2004, there won’t be a formal PvP system in WoW Classic at the outset. You’ll still be able to PvP, of course, and there will be no Dishonorable Kills, so you’ll be free to repeatedly hunt down every player and NPC in, say, Stranglethorn Vale to your stealthy heart’s content.  
---
&gt;That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. **The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12**. Keep in mind though, just as it did originally, it will require a substantial time investment to rank up through the Honor System. For those interested in the Rank Rewards, earning epic gear will require consistent dedication over a long period of time as a top contributor on your realm. We don’t expect to see many people running around with these items early on, but we’re certain Hillsbrad Foothills will still see its fair share of action!
---
How about play the game how you want to and let others play the game how they want to? Why are there so many of these posts of people saying their way of playing is the most correct way? You're never going to be able to control an entire population that expands across multiple servers. Why would you even want to?
---
Yeah Eranikus is a bitch and a half. I’ve found that there is one good strategy, when tank gets banished, just have the other person pop a speed pot, or if they’re ranged, just have them run away down the hall. He’s a big fella but he’s Chonky and slow. 
---
But yeah that boss is always fun. Hits like a truck + has 60k hp or so makes for a tough fight on its own.
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond. I saw that and was hoping that type of combat mechanic still existed. :^)
---
Of course which is why this meme is wrong lol. I learned to like harry potter a long time ago. Frankly being drug to some dumb ass sorting hat nonsense party my ex was going to. Is miles above going to see cats, or some other girl bull shit lol.
---
Does spell batching impact what I posted about? Thanks for the response by the way.
---
Not sure where are you playing on, must be a bad server
---
10% dps means sweet fuck all in classic compared to 40 people doing everything correctly.
---
We shouldn't even be discussing that kind of bad players lol
---
I do. I think he's funny at least.
---
Context, dwarf if a rogue, ne is the Hunter...
---
Assuming you don't change your play style when rested, or not, here is the math. First, when leveling and unrested, the amount of XP you get from mobs and quests are about equal. Let's call that value X. So when you play unrested, you get 2X experience points. When you play for the same amount of time rested, you'll get 3X experience points. Now of course, this isn't exact since gaining a level earlier can result in new quests being available sooner, being able to kill higher level mobs (worth more XP) sooner, etc. But overall it's a reasonable estimate that when rested, you'll take about two-thirds of the time per level than you'd take when unrested.
---
Mate don’t do it. You’ll most likely lose your job. Classic is awesome but seriously not being rank 12 is ok
---
I wonder *how* many people who say they aren’t returning are gonna end up sucked in again. I totally understand why people feel like they don’t want to, and that opinion is valid. But when it’s yhere to play, I feel like there’s some % of people who’s willpower will buckle.
---
Y'all be doin that magic of experimentation.
---
I followed for at least a year prior to getting into beta I remember, intensely that is. After it was announced I kept my eyes open for articles but I was only interested once I found the website and saw their updates.
---
I doubt this was uncommon and people were hyped as hell by the time it came out, hence the rush to add servers. They could drop this tomorrow I'm sure and see people scramble to join, and I'm also sure the community would spread it fast, but I expect some decent lead up to launch and lots of heads up warnings of when it was coming. The "Summer of Classic" mentioned a few weeks ago makes me think they will have events ready to go
---
Shaman if you're interested in PvP
---
You need someone to purge paladins, heal, and provide ranged burst.
---
Endgame you can easily do as a healer with ease and plenty of spots.
---
MC you can do just fine as ele/resto.
---
Mage and warlock fill a similar role but are much more popular.
---
Um, this is post normalization, so you always pick the highest dps, as your yellow attacks will scale higher.
---
Take a look at his helm and you'll know why. People were clueless.
---
It is these threads that make players not be bad.
---
\&gt;  Can't use it or can't equip it? 
---
What's the difference?
---
True but you have people acting like authority when the attitude in private servers still don't seem like how it was in 2004
---
Naked stunlock will stay

Hi, how hard is it to finish up a T2 set? I am debating between hunter (prinarily for the armor set) vs druid (for gameplay) but I don’t want to roll a hunter and spend all that time to find out T2 full set is not easily achieveable. I’ve never played vanilla before.
---
I find the loyalty of Horde players kind of interesting. I see so many posts where people would rather die than play Alliance, but I rarely ever see the same enthusiasm from Alliance players.
---
i think this timeline is very probable and pretty well spaced
---
we need more mods to delete threads like these
---
100% will be back
---
I really don't see how they could stop people from making lvl19 BG chars without making drastic changes to the game.
---
After reading what everyone had to say about it, I feel exactly the same way. I felt like I didn’t want a single change, I still might not want any changes, but a small part of me hopes that if one thing changes, it’s how Rank 14 is earned.
---
Not to make the game easier, not to make it more convenient, but maybe slightly change it just so it doesn’t favor account sharing and people literally only playing WoW without doing anything else with their life.
---
Although, I REALLY don’t like the idea of changes, so that’s hard for me to be comfortable with even that. People will no life this game no matter what, that’s their decision, but it just doesn’t sit will with me that Rank 14 is a mechanic that not only rewards people for no lifing the game, but also hurts other hardcore players that aren’t willing to sacrifice parts of their life to earn some of the best weapons in the game.
---
Rank 14 progression fundamentally encourages an unhealthy WoW lifestyle, but it’s also one of many things that makes WoW what it was. I guess I don’t want them to change it, but if they did, that’s the one change I wouldn’t speak up against, either.
---
Same here!
---
It’s the same for Druid. All T2 pieces drop off the same bosses. Hunters are pretty hard though and you’d be expected to kite in the razorgore fight and tranq two other boss fights. But other than that, just do your bow rotation and pump out the best damage you can.
---
In EU it was very very hyped, we watched and followed the game from US release in Nov. until we got it in Feb. Damn i was waiting in the middle of winter outside of the gameshop for 2hrs at 8:00 in the morning, and got the last 3 copies for my friend and me. It was intense.
---
How good are hunters in PvP at late game? Like a tier 3 geared hunter vs other tier 3 geared classes.
---
ADDED to Watch Later!
---
People that roll Hunters are pathetic.
---
Alternative character.
---
Logout and secure a second desired name.
---
Anytime
---
Oldschool RuneScape does it pretty well. You can quit for a year a two and still have the same progress as before without an expansion effectively resetting it. Though RuneScape and WoW are fundamentally different on a core level so you couldn't just copy OSRS' progression. idk
---
Nah their job is to get lucky WF procs and one shot AQ geared mages while in the 50s.
---
I guess my question was more “is it easier for hunters to get into the raid” since I wouldn’t really care at the pace I go for druid gear but I’d want the T2 set for hunter as soon as possible, but I think that answered my question regardless, thanks!
---
🧂
---
Found the 50iq huntard
---
Wow.
---
Oh!! Well it’s hard to say. Most guilds have only like 3ish maybe more Druids because of their innervate and battle res but that’s mostly it. Hunters you only really need 2 for tranq shot rotations and kiting but some take 3 just in case. By BWL hunter damage falls off so unlike in MC, where they are above average damage dealers, hunters become average/below average in BWL. I would say, if you can get squeezed in a main raid spot as a hunter for BWL in your guild, you can get geared incredibly fast because hunters are mostly used for their utility at that stage in the game, while Druids still have a more varied use through healing on top of their utility (battle res/innervate)

Pvp gear is more than competitive and it's easier for a flexible schedule person to pvp than to set aside raid times.

I actually looked at this a long time ago with no success.

Just took a peak and found some contact info for a guild I cleared 2 wings of Naxxramas with.

The problem is that it creates way more issues to fix it. Everyone knows it's an awful system. The problem is that if you make it more manageable, you make it more accessible to average players. If you make it more accessible to average players, you start to turn pvp grinding as a way to gear up for pve, or even a requirement for hardcore guilds. That would require an entire gear rebalance to fix. Just better to leave it as is.

Good old Gnomer taught me that lesson. Seeing 50 charging elite mobs chasing my cat is terrifying.

Yesss

I'm planning on running with some people who either haven't played since vanilla or not at all. We are going to run a 5 man group together for a few hours every Sunday night, kinda like a D&amp;D night. I was considering rolling ele/resto shaman, because they want to dps. I wasn't so sure about rolling shammy, but this post just made me more excited for that than anything else. It sounds like it will be a lot of fun leveling slowly. Thanks!

so zinrokh is probably best for pvp but very very minor?
---
Both, like a "meme" spec(boonkin, elemental shaman, etc) I welcome that and a lot of others do. In raids while we are trying to progress, you best be one of the best running those classes.

From 05-09 we ran on Andorhal as "Oscurio Remedio" with Simple Math, Immortals etc. So some of us already have end game content of how to play it. We are welcoming both old and new.

It's a difficult game and that's the way it should be. Last true great game in my opinion and I just hit 30. Pure nostalgia!

You find the scaling of all abilities, and their interactions and model them out, then simulate changes.

It is not something for a causal dive.
