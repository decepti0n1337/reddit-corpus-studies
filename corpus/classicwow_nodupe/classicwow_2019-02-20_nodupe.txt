Correct. You will be solo most of the times, even in BGs. If that makes sense. 
---
---
---
Raided on 1.12 private servers (rogue) as well and, in a way, I think you both are correct.
---

---
Warriors damage output is absolutely the best in the game overall.  BUT, it's very dependent on how good your tanks TPS is.  Simple as that.
---
The Tips Out data is definitely relevant, but is only a representation of the best of the best players.  It's showing what each class is capable of at the bleeding edge (being top 30 on a large private server isn't easy at all.  These will be the top 1%'ers in classic)
---
Warrior vs. Rogue in a more "hardcore" guild taking advantage of full consumes, optimized group setups for melee, good tanks running max TPS setups, good healers that can handle the increased damage and cheese mechanics, world buffs, etc. - Warriors win. Every single time.
---
Warrior vs. Rogue in a more casual environment where there's probably not melee-optimized groups, tanks running single sets of gear (not including resistance sets), less TPS output from tanks, less cheese mechanics, less consumables etc.. - I would think a rogue would win most of the time.  Vanish resetting threat to 0 is insanely strong, in this scenario especially.  The warrior would just be sitting on his hands for half the fight because he'll pull aggro and cant drop his threat.
---
Tauren rouges are the best. They are so good that nobody was able to spote them yet. 
---
Community?  Have you done lfd in the last 5 years or did a bg?  You're lucky if people don't talk too much.
---
Agreed. Im sick of all those "retail bad, classic good. Upvotes to the left" posts
---
The purple lamps guy.
---
Find a guild with the same interests as you and do dungeons and bgs with them
---
Good evening, my question is in regards to racials making or breaking a class? I'd really like to pick up where I left off as a Tauren Hunter. I understand there are better choices, but I was wondering if my personal preference will reduce my chances of getting into an active raiding guild or performance in general. Thank very much
---
Ideally yeah, but both stealth and vanish were buggy as HELL back then. I remember at one point it seemed every battleground there was one random person that could target me in stealth from halfway across the map. People either don't remember or gloss over all the crappy bugs that came and went back then. Then again most people here probably never actually played back then.
---
Logitech used to make quality hardware. Then They outsourced everything to Asia 
---
Hey guys. Obviously people have been floating the idea of post Naxx content for some time now. Mainly Kara as its the biggest no brainer. Just wondering how ya'll felt about some of the other missed opportunities from back in the day, and seeing i made a video on it figured i'd post it here.
---
Im a big "no changes" guys fyi, just keep in mind the original content cycle is complete after Naxx. So imo expanding Classic's longevity in this way both circumvents infringing on the original Vanilla experience, while also exploring underutilized areas from back in the day.
---
I agree with pretty much everything you said. From personal experience I would say rogues are good every 10 minutes (when prep is up lol) there is a private server that has all your cooldowns reset for every duel. And I feel so sorry for all the rogues that are used to dueling under those conditions, getting a false impression on how good they are. Blowing all their cooldowns + tidal charm + preparation for every duel just to keep up with the other classes. 
---
Staff of the Ogre Magi &gt; Elemental mage staff
---
Apparently no such guide exists. I’ve searched and asked 
---
&gt; the dungeon items added in 1.10&lt; will most likely not be there from the start, hence they're not in the list!
---
&gt; 
---
When was this discussed? Did I miss a Q&amp;A?
---
1 spriest per raid with 16 debuff slots isnt a "lesser spec"
---
Then simply logout for a few days (legit?)
---
Its more about the comunity feeling coneccted again. Sharding imo has ruined the MMO part of WoW,its no longer connected its all scattered and its fucking sad. You can do everyting in retail BUT your just going thru the motions and at leased in classic you will be doing everything with the sense that you will most likey see these players many times, where as in retail its a one and done never gonna see you guys again. not to mention EVERYONE will be at the exact same spot day one. So there will be this urgency to be the first one to be lvl 60. In turn making questing and leveling fun again with the idea that everyone is on equal footing.
---
Shadow Priest IS a lesser spec. It's 100% not a needed class. In fact your raid will run more efficiently without a Shadow Priest.  
---
Shadow Priest is part of the 2006 Vanilla stigma which is backwards and wrong in 2019. The community simply is stubborn in their old ways and unwilling to educate themselves.
---
Thanks for the answers guys! You are awesome!
---
Leveling your first rogue unlocks a side of you that you never knew was there.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You basically feel like a cat in a world of mice.  Even the biggest mouse has to take a rest and you'd be surprised how long you will sneak, watch and wait for that opportunity to present itself.
---
Oh no i agree 100% but its going to be nice to just play WORLD of warcraft not just RAID of warcraft you know? Even if it only like that for a few months. The game is best played when everyone is finding out what that game means to them. And i think the recapturing of that feeling is what classic wow will do most. For me personally its the WORLD aspect of WOW.
---
I'm still using my MX518. Picking it apart every 2 years and clean it. It still works to this day flawlessly.
---
Well at least rogues aren't mushrooms!
---
Looks pretty good overall, but a few things seem off. Why are you excluding every Arena item? They were in game pre-1.10
---
For rogue pre-Raid: precisely calibrated broomstick &gt; Satyrs bow/black crow. 
---
For warriors. Savage Gladiator Chain is as likely to be in game as any other piece in that list. Even if it’s not by some ungodly reason, cadaverous armor is better than the pieces listed in both stage 1 and stage 2. (76 AP 8/20 Crit Chance v 26 AP 2% Crit Chance) and (76AP 8/20 Crit Chance v 80ap)
---
The one where the wind fury slot machine lands jackpot twice in a row
---
You had me until Shadow Priests suck outstide of 1v1. Considering they have access to dispel magic, and shield. They are still the OP goat for classic pvp imo.
---
Heals are most mana efficient of any healing class.
---
Their DPS can be competitive if played right and time invested getting their gear.
---
Bear is viable. I don't know what you mean by other classes because it is 100% more viable than Paladin and they can tank almost any boss in vanilla. 
---
They aren't a better MT than a warrior. Warriors got far better CDs and Druids are a bit more prone to spiky damage but what they do excel at is for guilds speed running *(they got way better TPS than warrior and can allow DPS to go balls to the wall, and keeping a fury warrior in DPS instead of tank makes fights go faster. Faster fight = less boss damage dished out)*. And really they aren't that much worse than warrior in the damage taking department, its just a bit more spiky. 
---
Often times a warrior will sacrifice some of their insane defense gear to get threat gear where as a druid inherently has that great threat. The stigma from being unplayable tanks pre patch 1.2.0 follow them even to this day. Oh and you get to gear 1 less plate tank if you decide on taking. Saves a ton of time, and resources. 
---
Went on a rant about bears but bottom line is they are viable but they take a ton of commitment. To be a great tank druid you need to know how to tank, heal, dps and get gear sets for at least two of the three to be utilized correctly. Because sometimes you are the bad option for tanking and simply healing, dpsing or decursing is a better option.
---
That was just 1 of the duels, dude. 
---
In the world when they equip their shield and laugh in your face. Mained a Shaman on enough classic servers. Rogue is an easy match up assuming your 60 and have gear. Leveling and fresh though. That cold blood eviscerate will blow your crap up though.
---
The track skills are hotbar-able so I'm thinking of a toggle macro
---
Lucky WF proc crits twice through evasion. I’d buy a lottery ticket.
---
I actually played a rogue back then, and mained that rogue for 14 years. Stealth and vanish have almost always been buggy. They fixed it for a while iirc but Subterfuge talent brought more bugs. Anyway, in vanilla it depends on a lot of factors. You can increase your stealth level with talents and items (maybe even consumables iirc), but stealth detection can be increased as well. For example, a hunter could be using track hidden and Catseye goggles with hidden helm option, and easily see you from 15 yards. Also, if a hunter (prob lock too) targets you from across the map and send his pet on you, the pet will track you even if you stealth (iirc it worked like this in retail). 
---
Stealth is very weak and frustrating in PvP without the proper talents. 
---
I played classic with a mouse but from mid-Wrath till now I’ve been using a trackball. Currently using a CST L-trac which doesn’t look the least bit sexy but is built like a tank. I fully expect to be using it for the next decade if not longer.
---
Rogues have the 2nd best armor reducer in the game with expose armor, second only to sunder. I think it actually beats sunder too if you spec into it. They also have an armor pen talent in sub tree. Everything else you said is accurate though.
---
I think I must have been one of the three people worldwide that played vanilla with an MX1000.
---
Possibly the most fun levelers, atleast from a variety perspective. But yea end game youre basically gonna have to he a healer. Although my guild did have a great druid OT. Thing is, its a boring ass life and you get no loot.
---
Make a quiz/survey on survey monkey?
---
Pretty sure back then I was just using whatever piece of crap mouse my dad had for the family computer. I picked up Logitech G600 a few years back, and I don't even know how I would play without 14 extra buttons and a shift modifier. I've picked up a few extras just in case my old trust fails. 
---
They go OOM in BG's. You are better off sitting outside shadowform and using utility and downranked heals in a premade if you are invited. There is a tri spec for just that. No one actually plays shadow forms going for rank 14. Priests are in no way useless though. Maybe you thought that's what I meant. My list is just for 1 v 1. Priests are freakin awesome in BG as a class. Being a healer that can also find the flag carrier with tricks like /mindvision fourtwenty is incredible. So is throwing people off cliffs in AB.  You just aren't good as damage outside destroying people 2 on 1 3 on 1 in pugs when prayer or devouring plague is up.
---
Same here, man. You just don’t get that experience anymore in online games. 
---
o0 ok that makes more sense. Being worth while on a premade team though isn't the same as being worthless in BG's which is what I thought you meant. In pub Bg's Shadow Priests are amazing.
---
I normally cap out at R10. I am not a big enough Masochist for farm for R14 lol. So I am not sure what the meta for that is. It's a pretty esoteric set of skills for that.
---
Grim Batol couldve been a pretty awesome raid. Shame they never got around to it back in the day. Im not rly against adding in the clear omissions from vanilla after Naxx tbh.
---
There are some issues with his content but unfortunately for him he seems to have become the nickel back of wow classic content creators 
---
Great idea. Ill he doing this.
---
Yeah rank 10 gear is all you need on spriest anyways. Get that and Anathema and you are a powerhouse. 
---
To me, it's fairly likely that that was done in order to protect your account in a way.        
---
You went to another country and the first thing your account did in that country was post a link.         
---
Makes sense to me that that would cause something automated to trigger.
---
What’s up with this attitude that blizz isn’t allowed to reduce staff?  I bet they don’t have 10 million WoW subs anymore, so why should they keep GM’s around that they don’t even need?
---
Personally, I hope Blizzard chooses to do this after Classic has run its course. Gradually expanding the content while keeping true to the design philosophy of Vanilla is a great way to keep the Classic servers alive after most players are done with Naxx.
---
Destroyed pally healing for me. Never went back.
---
What is spell batching and why won’t it be a thing in Classic, if it was in vanilla?
---
[removed]
---
Honestly the Logitech g600 is just better in almost every way... 
---
I don't miss my razor naga at all...
---
Getting groups for DM:W are really only issue due to finding a tank. My advice is to make friends with a druid or pally and help them get a tank set for tanking 5 mans. Both these classes will tank pretty well in DM:W so long as you have at least 2 hunters or a hunter and a priest for those tough couple of ghost pulls. You could also pay a tank, or have a guild tank help you run it. That healing trinket from there is great for healers and the theres some good gear for hunters both off the first and last boss. 
---
Really, really hard to pick. As a (mostly) night elf main I'm going to have to go with Teldrassil for it being both unique for a MMO zone, and having a gorgeous soundtrack.
---
Dun Morogh is a close second, for similar reasons as the soundtrack is hugely nostalgic for me, and the inn in Kharanos always feels like home. Anvilmar in Coldridge Valley is pretty cool too, and I liked how the tunnel filled with troggs was a rite of passage.
---
I'm assuming he's referencing how classic will be progressive. Idk how the dungeons follow this timeline though. 
---
Favorite is Dwarf zone. Cozy is the word that comes to mind for me.
---
Worst for me is Night Elf zone. I hate the purple. This place puts me to sleep. I hate the burrows, i'm convinced the entire reason night elves get wisp form is to alleviate their pains in the burrows lol.
---
Hunter race doesn't matter for raiding. Picking the optimal race troll instead of tauren is a negligible 1% or less DPS increase.
---
By the time Naxx is out for a few months, i think itll be clear the server needs a jumpstart of new content. Sure some people will want to continue on to BC or reroll on a fresh server, but theres just so many missed opportunities that itd be a shame no to explore them. 
---
We can always go to BC in time.

I think those additions would be cool, so long as the gear doesn’t exceed Naxxramas stats, and that there will always be an original, unaltered Vanilla for people to play. There are unintended consequences here, imagine a Vanilla where nobody really runs Molten Core because Grim Batol is pretty easy and gives better gear for most slots. 
---
I do take issue with the “split the playerbase” argument though. So, imagine that Naxx came out, and a year or two later, these 4 raids have all been out for a while too. What then? You can’t infinitely cram Vanilla with more and more content to keep people playing the 1 Classic game for decades. I would enjoy some additions, but too many will just clutter the game. And at that point, they would likely release BC anyways, even if a little bit delayed.
---
Also, the playerbase won’t be split as much as people think it will be. There is obviously a large audience that wants nothing to do with BC. There’s also a large audience that would love to play BC after a while. That audience that wants to play BC isn’t really going to be spending that much time in Vanilla after so many years. I know I’ll love Vanilla, but after 4 years, I’m going to unsubscribe for sure, until BC comes out. For example, I love Ocarina of time, but maybe sometimes I want to play Wind Waker too? If I’m sick of Ocarina, having Wind Waker as an option isn’t taking me away from Ocarina because I wasn’t that into it by that point anyways.
---
Also, I like these options, but I don’t like the thought of backporting content from Cata or BC to Vanilla. Have you seen the alpha version of Karazhan? Something like that would fit really well with Vanilla, and it wouldn’t be backported content we’ve already done. Same idea with Uldum and Grim Batol. We already know what’s in there right? They would have to make the focus of the content a side-route instead of a retread of the original content. In that case, Uldum and Grim Batol would be really fun.
---
One other area that’s a little mysterious is the furlbog gate in North Azshara. Or, if the portal in south Winterspring opened up a small section of a demonic fortress in Hyjal, rather than Hyjal as a whole.
---
Yea now that I get what you are saying I can agree. Kinda like with a Enhance shaman. They can wreck people but if your ranking your resto.
---
Exactly. Imo what is there to lose giving it a shot once the cycle of original content is over? Would everyone really prefer to just reroll fresh? 
---
And as far as BC, its not going anywhere lol.

So in vanilla, the servers would basically work on a “tick” system. So (for the sake of example) every second, the server would process the spells that were casted in between each tick. 
---
With this system in place, people could time their spells between each tick, allowing players to basically overlap their spells. A common example is that it would allow two players to sheep each other.  
---
In context between rogues and mages, rogues would do a neat little trick. As you recall, mages can blink through a stun ie cheap shot. So what would rogues do is they would open with cheap shot, and they would time their gouge just before a mage blink. If successful, they would gouge the mage just as the mage blinks, causing it to reappear gouged on the other end of the blink, essentially allowing them to recover the gap between the two. 
---
In vanilla, this was an unintended result from technical limitations. Blizzard has already mentioned that they probably won’t include it in the rerelease of classic since—as previously mentioned—this was an intended effect from the limitations of the time. 
---
Some people are for it, but some people are adamant on #nochanges. Personally, I don’t really care if it’s includes or not 
---
Ya I think a bis list with not-too-much worse alternates would be very useful!
---
Hmm true but if you're on a balanced server you'd at least know that 50% of your server couldn't kill you if they wanted
---
I agree. Theres a spreadsheet floating around for prebis that has multiple options. That's what I would use, but once raiding I think is where this list shines.
---
Seeing that bright red kitty nursery claw my face 
---
Druids can start grinding 3 mobs at once around lvl 16 with 0 downtime. Make sure to choose mobs 2-3 lvl under you.
---
Cats make great target since they attack fast, thorn damages them twice faster.
---
Check out a held in off hand item from a duskwood quest if you go that route
---
Content is not easy to make and I dont think the Blizzard of today makes a bet for invest into this more that he already did. To get more content after naxx they should  already have plans. As someone that only have experienced vanilla on private servers (and had a lot of fun) I would love more content but vanilla already has a fuck ton adding more and keep the feel of vanilla will requiere the talent of people that already left the company.
---
Alliance still showed up, because their zones generally sucked and didn't have good enough quest hubs... so they ended up at the shimmering flats.
---
Internal beta maybe, we haven't heard anything though.
---
Omg.
---
Thank you
---
If your answer isn't mulgore, get out of my face.
---
No shit, my BM pet could literally solo clothies in the 40s and 50s
---
First rule of 1k Needles. No one talks about 1k Needles.
---
Morgan Freeman for me.
---
1k is probably my top 5 or top 10 favorite zones in vanilla. Love it for some reason.
---
Then again maybe im a tard because I actually like Desolace/Silithis. 
---
No you don't. But you probably do need them to clear everything first, or at least be in the race. And that means many will just copy that and there will be a fair bit of prejudice against anything that's not seen as the ideal class/build.
---
One of the downsides of everyone knowing everything about the game - or at least thinking they do. Only make a druid your main if you love the class, are willing to work harder than everyone else and can deal with people thinking you're 2nd best for everything.
---
Now THAT’s a solid idea right there. You got me thinking of trying the same thing now haha.
---
Would be interesting.
---
I mean Khara can be 1-1. That doesn't matter much... but Grim Batol was intertwined with the Cataclysm story line so they would have to come up with a new scenario even if they re-used the map. 
---
Avoid STV
---
I’d love to see that too.
---
There’s nothing to milk ya fuckin dummy
---
Best kiters in pvp
---
That 4 spirit buff turns out to be a whole hell off a lot in the real world and everybody nearby starts having religious experiences and all their wounds heal.
---
I think druid is the best class in classic WoW hands down, amazing in pvp, versitile in playstyles, and an easy class to level and solo farm with

I for one hope that this does *not* happen to classic. 
---
Let’s just say that this did happen, two or three years later there are are too many complications. Stats,  the stats go up and a squish would be required. People will be way too overpowered and one shot lowbies. That’s just one of many issues with adding additional content to classic. 
---
And after all those years, we will be asking for plain old vanilla wow as it was, repeating the cycle once again.
---
Leave classic as it was, have new servers release over again restarting the cycle or move onto burning crusade and release a wow trilogy going up to wotlk. 
---
Blizz would just fuck it up.
---
Leave Classic alone imho.
---
I have not found a game release in the last... Atleast 3 to 4 years that have not supported ultra wide and games ever before that have been modded to work.
---
/r/ultrawidemasterrace
---
Shimmering flats is the tits
---
Isn't this post about 1v1 duels? You are bringing world PvP and BGs into it.
---
Leveling like everyone else, The talent trees, famring for mats. dungeons and eventually raids with a good guild. But first just leveling. Im bored with the current generation of MMO's until Lost Ark comes out. Will give that a go but that proparly 2020 or 2021 so i have plenty of time to get to grip again with Classic.
---
Cat Form. While I could only do it once, I can stay in it as long as I want and I get to do some pretty cool cat stuff.
---
Tirisfal Glades/Silverpine Forest combo is definitely number one for me. I like the eerie/mysterious/decrepit feeling of these zones.
---
Dun Morogh is second. Durotar is my least favorite.
---
Everyone who isn’t a successful streamer hates streamers because they are successful.
---
Can you ankh though?
---
I am the same m8. I quit wow in wrath of the lich king when it started getting abit too kiddy in my personal opinion. I am coming back for classic. But if micotranactions come into classic im gone. Maybe not so much for mounts of pets BUT level boosts would just kill it for everyone. Put this image into your head. You have just started a new character like everyone else. Your leveling and eventually get to stormwind as a level 8 for example and there is 2 dozen level 60's there allready only after an hour or two gameplay. WTF lol totally killed the game.
---
Neutral 
---
I’d honestly put rogue t2 above paladin. I mean I may be biased but maybe it’s cuz I see t2 paladin so much. 
---
One way to circumvent the whole power creep issue is making Grim Batol a 10-man dungeon for levels 52-60 much like BRD. Or maybe even 45-55. You could forgo nerfing the entrance guard mobs by creating new ways for players to reach the dungeon entrance, like a secret path.   
---
   
---
Kara would just have to be endgame content, regarding the zone's level.   
---
Uldum could be 55-60, with T1 equivalent drops for a few slots but not all.   
---
I'm not sure if Hyjal should be a raid at all. There's no time travel involved this time; it might as well be a max level zone with good resources and quests. Maybe an expanded rep system that ties in to the Cenarion Circle.  
---
  
---
Adding new "better: gear isn't really an option as others have said. The difference between a Naxx geared player and a fresh 60 are already pretty drastic because damage output scales better than survivability. 2-3 more tiers and you'd have 60s running around oneshotting eachother.
---
And I can't see how new content without increased gear quality would fit into the natural gear progression structure. New content outfits your raid members with better gear so that previously cleared encounters get easier and you have a better shot at the final boss(es). 
---
If new gear is equal to Naxx quality gear, then how do you make the raids more difficult without the natural gear check? I guess the could add Sunwell/ICC style raid debuffs but that still doesn't provide the raider with any reward for clearing content. Potentially you could add cosmetics but I don't know if that is enough incentive to farm mats for a raid more difficult than Naxx.
---
Additionally, if you do add new "Naxx quality" gear, how do you ensure that isn't in anyway better than previous gear? We all know that we'd try and squeeze out a few extra stats from specific pieces to make our character better.
---
You could potentially squish stats from the beginning and retune all raid content so that the gear from the final new raid is "Naxx quality" while all previously raids are lesser... but that's a BIG change. 
---
I almost forgot about bushido in mtg until you said that.
---
Damn i'm using one of these bad bois right now had it for like 10 years
---
I agree, and my personal caveat is that if BC/WotLK are here and done with, and it's 10 years down the road? I would play a purchase-in Vanilla server that was re-imagined. Dungeons for every level, extra raids and a slightly zested-up version of MC. 
---
...if they still keep an original version of Classic. Blizzard would never get rid of a pure Vanilla, though, after going so far out of their way to bring it back.
---
Orb of motherfuckin deception
---
This almost makes me want to play rogue again.
---
But then I remember that I don't have nearly the same amount of time to dedicate to the game as all of the people who are going to hit cap in 1 week and camp lowbie questing grounds.
---
Wow, someone who speaks sense. Go figure he gets down voted by Reddit. Typical Redditors.  
---
I can't wait until Classic launches and people find out that this is actually how it'll be in any reputable guild. Shadow Priest is a dated class and idea which casual and social guilds will think is desired.
---
I think you mean shreds a druid tear 
---
I used to AoE farm/level on my prot pally.  It was quite a lot of fun to pull large groups and let them beat themselves to death on me.  However, I hated the looting and eventually gave it up.
---
I think a good way to approach this is by looking at what happened to Old School Runescape. Old School Runescape has been a tremendous success that's been going steady for 6 years. Over this time, Jagex added a lot of content that was not there back in 2007.  A great example is the continent of Zeah.

The content added is excellent, for the most part. It's challenging and has a genuine 2007 feel, despite being brand new. It has content for most levels, and has great lore. As I walk through a place like Varrock, I can still feel some nostalgia with the music and the regular world has relatively unchanged. But, at the same time, it's not 'the same'. I'm not sure how I feel about it, to be honest. 
---
Yeah but that's not nearly as much fun 
---
Wait - there's a Hide Pants button too?
---
All the more reason to sneak past them!
---
&gt; Paladins were once known to aoe grind a lot more on private servers but that was because Consecration scaled with physical stats before being fixed. Most level Ret now because spell damage gear for paladins is a late game and even later patch reality.
---
Ret's faster, but I enjoyed prot pally leveling in vanilla.  Timing my seals, bubbles, bandages, and pots with 15+ mobs beating on me was fun.
---
I loved my spriest for pvp. Even against rogues. As a NE tailor it was hard for them to stealth open if I saw the enter stealth to attack. They would need to get close enough to see me while stealthed and as long as I wasn’t facing away when they approached I would usually get a fear off. Once I netted them I could usually MC drown or throw them off a cliff if terrain was available. Even without dots and nets seemed to do the trick unless they got some good crits off. 
---
I've stalked people for **far** longer than I'm proud of just to get them to 1 health in the middle of a pull and let a mob finish them off. 
---
I started around 35 AoE grinding on my prot pally but it didn't become very effective until I got plate armor. 
---
That’s exactly what happened to my Naga. It’s sad because that was still one of my more favorite mice but it lasted me at least two years.
---
Yeah, that's not why..
---
I could probably do it but they probably won't hire me
---
The only One-Hand specific SP weapons seem to be the AB and Rank 14 daggers.
---
Tips has high production quality
---
It is not even close to being as bad as a shaman or retri tho. It might not be 100% optimal but it is way more viable than the rest of the lesser specs. 
---
&gt;I've never seen a sub so hostile to streamers in my life. Why does this sub hate streamers? Do you not want to watch WoW streams? 
---
First of all, it's not the streamers we hate, it's the fans of streamers we hate. The streamers themselves are annoying, but can be ignored. It's the literal tens of thousands of people we have to interact with every day that obsess over the streamers, that's what we hate.
---
Second of all, no, I don't give a rat's ass about watching some annoying douche play a game I could just be playing myself. Unless he's a top tier PvP player and I actually have something to learn, I don't find watching other people play games to he particularly enthralling. 
---
&gt;Why not? I have a theory that people are aching for the old days of gaming before microtransactions, Ninja, etc and they view streamers as an intrusion of that fantasy. But that's all it is, a fantasy. That era of gaming (sadly) is dead. 
---
No, that's not why. 
---
&gt;The future is Pewdiepie screeching, Logan Paul exploring suicide forests in a toy story hat, and Ninja hanging out with celebrities. This is the environment Classic is heading into. It will be warped and shaped by it whether you like it or not. So why the hostility towards the idea of streaming classic WoW, even from guys like Kripparian if he takes a break from HS for a few days.
---
Again, those aren't the issues. A bunch of morons acting like morons isn't a problem. It's the thousands and thousands of little retarded children following them around on whatever server they play on, mass reporting people who kill the streamer, doing everything they can to troll the streamer or the unfortunate bastards on the same server as the streamer, and whatever other exciting consequences come from having thousands of children trying to cyberstalk some moron. **That** is what people hate. 
---
If you were lucky enough to not play on one of the demo servers when a streamer was on, then I understand your ignorance. But ask anyone on Server 1 who was playing when Assmangold hopped on, or look up a video or find his vod of it, and you'll very quickly understand. 
---
Unless you’re trying to get into a really serious raiding/pvp guild, it won’t matter. Like another poster said, it’s like a 1% dps difference. 
---
Just play what you’d like :)
---
I used [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12d6fF3e41mE_9kZCNiSXAKNYyg6rfKuNbhsvXD-CUTw/edit#gid=617783111) a while back in preparation of a private server launch

---
I fucking hate 1kn.
---
Yeah the 1 out of 10 where he got the proc on the weapon...The rest he got dusted.
---
Hey hey hey Ol’ Sooty would like a word with you about how cool Loch Modan is. I can’t wait to quest there again. 
---
Yep.  Rogues were in a really unfavorable spot in 1.12 for 1v1.  I played a rogue when 1.12 was live, and it seemed like everything beat my ass.
---
You lucky son of a Bitch LoL 
---
Just joking no hard feelings 
---
I have had a g600 since 2012 still works like a charm
---
&gt;Second was a dwarf I leveled through Dun Morogh, a couple of quests in Elwynn, Darkshore, and Redridge.
---
try Dun Morogh, Loch Modan, Darkshore, Loch Modan, Darkshore.
---
My experience leveling a warrior too, and the three ganking alliance 60's didn't make it easier
---
You are just bad.
---
Nice work.
---
Now finish whatever error people find and then add pictures how the charactery look in the suggested BIS sets! Do this and you will be KING.
---
MTA were not in vanilla, that’s my optimism 
---
OP is a retard. I played this game so much at this patch level it is shameful, and he couldn’t be more wrong. I am not sure if he is basing this off a bad memory when he was 12 and didn’t know how to play his class or if he is just an idiot.
---
Well I googled the shit out of it and couldn’t find nothing. Hope you guys would say fuck ya it’s started today. My bad boys.
---
Next time.
---
Christopher Walken.
---
&gt; (Almost) no one is going to ID that AI in a couple minute cold call scenario.
---
Yeah, because most of the time they don't actually care.  If I get called by a telemarketer I'm not going to sit there testing it to see if it's a robot or not, I'm going to answer the phone and listen for a minute or two until I realize that I'm talking to a telemarketer and then I'm going to hang up.  I don't actually care in that situation whether I'm talking to a robot or a human, so I don't try to figure it out.  I just hang up on the telemarketer.  
---
That doesn't mean that I *couldn't* distinguish between a robot or human if I wanted to, though.  That's the difference.  If someone told me "You're about to be called by a telemarketer, try to figure out if it's an AI or a human." I could do it easily, as could 99% of the population.  These things are still very dumb, all it takes is a few questions to figure out what you're dealing with.  They might sound good when they can go down their dialogue trees but they can't think outside the box, any kind of wierd or nonsensical question will make it very obvious what you're talking to.
---
&gt; When you consider that voice is infinitely harder than chat and AI GMs are perfectly viable.
---
I've never said they're not viable, they might be, it would depend on what they're doing.  All I took issue with was the guy above saying that people couldn't tell the difference.  They easily could, it's not hard.
---
&gt; In fact I would wager you've interacted with an AI service agent and don't even know it.
---
I probably have but again, that's only because I don't care what I'm talking to over the phone when I'm troubleshooting something or when a telemarketer calls me.  I'm not testing everyone over the phone to see if they're human or not.  Just because I don't do that though, doesn't mean that people *can't* tell the difference, if they want to.  If I'm ever talking to someone over the phone and I want to know if they're a robot or not, it would likely take less than 60 seconds to find out.  The average person could do so easily.  The day that becomes not true is the day computers pass the turing test and it will be a very, very big deal.  When that happens we'll all know about it.
---
Heh, I'm in that situation currently. I've likely decided on a druid main now and I think that trinket (the tank one) is the overall best choice for all specs, comparatively. I'm pretty sure it's almost irreplaceable for bears across the entirety of vanilla (?).  All the rewards are so good though; eyes of the beast for resto/balance, blackhand's breadth for cat and mark of tyranny for bears. Fucking important choices in an RPG, what is this madness? 
---
This.
---
I think it should be used as a failsafe for Classic WoW. They should just stay true to the #nochanges, but if one in the far future we find ourselves in a situation where we have a dying classic community, then places like Uldum and stuff could be utilized to keep Classic going, a measure of last resort. The ideal situation for me would be to get classic with as close to #nochanges as possible, then play that until I start to lose interest(which would probably be around 1- 2 years after clearing naxx and getting all the gear I want, hard to say but that is my best guess.) At that point, I would much rather have Activision Blizzard(god have mercy on my soul) add some new raid like was suggested in the video, than to go to TBC. Even though I LOVED TBC, it was a step in the wrong direction(daily quests, flying mounts, arena, valor tokens, new races, heroic dungeons, etc etc). I also hardcore raided from beginning to end in retail TBC, and Im not doing that again. Vanilla is true WoW to me and I will only stay within that realm.
---
Everybody gets fury wrong, literally everyone.
---
I run classic off my 13" Macbook Pro and plug it into a 32" 4k monitor at 3840x2160. I don't think the problem is the client, it's probably your laptop. I assume you've tried updating / installing your display drivers?
---
The best advice of them all if you want to avoid ganks at launch... Play NE hunter. Keep your health topped at all time and you mana above 80%. Use your trackings and watch your minimap. Flare/meld when you need to drink. If you're in a busy area, flare yourself/drop traps even when fighting mob in case someone tries to jump you. 
---
Hunters are pretty good at discouraging a ganker to open on them because their pet is scary and they always have high health. But if you get jumped it can be difficult to gain distance or survive dots. 
---
Once you have BW, never use it on mobs, at this point you can avoid all gank by killing anyone in sight. Don't hesitate to Viper sting and run, repeat til our target is oom  or dead to your pet damage. 
---
Well, you can already oneshot lowbies, they are by very definition lower level than you and as a byproduct don't have good gear and are easily killed with good gear.
---
well your definitely going to be allowed to buy gametime with gold and gold will be able to be bought for real money but I dont see why thats such a big deal, people used to buy gold from sellers all the time back in the day so it really doesnt change anything aside from the benefit of being able to play for free
---
Healer here. I use click-to-heal stuff like Clique (mouse-over macros for lazy people). I recently noticed that there are certain spells I use infrequently, just because they’re bound to a less convenient key. 
---
I’m thinking of investing in a better mouse to overcome this. Assuming no budget limitations, what’s the best option out there? Is it the mx518? It might be a while before this re-release is obtainable here anyway. I’m open to alternatives. 
---
I like Durotar.
---
So for him, nothing would change?
---
I think some of these are probably not likely to be in at the start right?
---
Some of the resto shaman stuff is from enemies from the T2 dungeon quests. will they be in right away? not sure.
---
When I use the word “lowbie”  I’m generally speaking levels 1-55. But yes, you do have a point but the problem would also occur even with 60s getting oneshot with lower dungeon/raid gear. If they added content with gear stats higher than Naxx, thus me referring to having to have a stat squish etc etc. 
---
Sorry to hijack and shill but Corsair makes a really great mouse that's similar. I've had it for a couple years now and it still functions perfectly. I think it's called the scimitar. 
---
Cant say i disagree with your concern about inflated stats, but it doesnt have to be that way in implementation. Kara could act as the AQ20 of the Naxx tier gear wise for example. 
---
For me, whether a lvl 60 takes 1 shot or 3 shots to kill a lowbie is irrelevent. In no scenario are they going to win as it already stands, though i understand this is just one example of possible fallout.
---
At the end of the day, the alternative is a dead server with the content cycle complete.   
---
I mean you could say this about classic itself. This hypothetical is under the assumption that they can deliver. 
---
You again didn't include tps list for tanks, or if you did it's wrong
---
It was just a cheeky thing to go for in one of the duels, I'm sure they went back and forth. It's not like you, me, or anyone else saw all of their duels on a closed server. 
---
No, that means the quest is only acceptable by alliance characters. However, capitals that belong together are "linked," and you will get 25% of the main rep value for all others. For example, a quest that is listed as 100 rep with Stormwind will also give 25 for Darnassus and Ironforge, even though it doesn't show up in the rep gains in chat. Over the course of 60 levels those 25% here and there will amount to a considerable chunk of what's needed for exalted.
---
Oh, okay. thanks. 
---
If they add stats higher than Naxx, inflated itemization becomes a problem for level 60s that are geared in lower raids/dungeons as well, not just lowbies. 
---
There’s only a minute amount of filler content that could be added pre-Naxx, which really doesn’t make sense to me. 
---
The server may be dead, but that’s the joy in starting on a fresh vanilla server, the content has great replay value. 
---
But if they die too then all the of the antagonizers will pretty quickly encounter a bit of a darwinian process until there aren't any left.
---
Warrior it is.
---
I played both ally and horde and I have to disagree, Ally have far more polished and complete zones. 
---
Posted 11 hours ago, so I'm removing this as a repost, sorry!
---
Who is left at blizzard who gives a shit about that though?
---
I’d very likely enjoy Classic WoW going it’s own way after Naxx (or possibly TBC). Different expansions that keep the classic gameplay and systems in place. 
---
Obviously Cata wouldn’t work, but maybe WotLK could if you take out all the dungeon finder, faceroll difficulty, possibly death knights, etc. 
---
Classic mouse, but when it comes to mice for wow I want to get a new one of [these](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s—LYWLicxD—/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/18mjttgjlouyhjpg.jpg) bad boys...
---
Ah, cool. No worries!
---
I didn’t mind Heroic Dungeons too much, and I was fine with the new races (to an extent, everyone and their brother rolled a BE it seemed) but many of the other things I could do without. 
---
If Blizzard could go back and do it all again, I’m certain they never would have added flying mounts into the game. 
---
Mine died last year, so I got a new one from the same family. It's been only a year, and the mouse wheel is already broken, not to mention the other issues I've had in that period, such as stuttering and registering single clicks as double. I'm really happy to read this news.
---
Asmongold tabs back into a Garr kill to everyone freaking out about a binding drop. He gets the binding. SeemsGood.
---
There are plenty of other newer, fresher titles for whales to spend their wealth on.  Classic WoW with microtransactions would be about as successful as Classic WoW Battle Royale.  Whales only spend money when there are other people around to show it off to, if the non-whales all leave, the whales will follow.
---
Completely right. All I did in a premade on the journey to R14 was defend Stables in AB or the flag in WSG. There was little to no PvP involved.
---
As ally, used to rape all the quest hubs in 1k needles. Was fun...
---
Jesus Christ, I basically thought of the exact same title he used. This website has ruined my brain.
---
True, but ZG being a 20 man raid should have been an upgrade to dungeon blues at around MC level.  Granted MC gear wasn't great.  But the gear ZG was just too good.  I can see how ZG dropping a piece of gear here and there for some classses would warrant people in AQ40+ to come back, which is good, but it was just too much in my opinion.
---
The ROGUE... WALKS quietly... in THE shadows
---
I'd take all this stuff with a grain of salt.  No one knows how Classic will turn out and these are from private servers. 
---
 /who 
---
just see where they are in game and compare to stream
---
Not after using up all that RNG
---
I mained a hunter in vanilla and play one on priv servers. I think they're pretty skill based in PvP (obviously a cheese class for PvE).
---
I've PvP'd quite a lot over the years but I'm still somewhat casual and middling in terms of skill. I get rekt in open world PvP playing a hunter in vanilla. Especially at lower levels when I can't justify buying every situational skill. It takes a certain finesse to work around your dead zone and keep people at an appropriate range. I think modern hunters are much stronger in PvP situations than vanilla hunters.
---
I think noob hunters will get beaten by noob players using other classes 95% of the time in world PvP. They're great in BGs where you can lurk back and you're in a PvP mindset, but when someone gets the jump on you in STV it's pretty tough to turn it around.
---
Here's the problem.  Blizzard ninja nerfed all of the good AoE spots pre-1.12 - including ZG.  They added additional elite fish in the waters.  This also includes DM lashers etc.
---
All this was lost on private servers and/or 1.12.  
---
So what are we going to get in Classic?  Who knows.  AoE farming was great while it lasted, but it didn't last very long.
---
No better feeling than getting jumped at a disadvantage and STILL killing the rogue.
---
I play on 32" 4k at the moment and I love it, definitely recommend it, it does help with some things like spotting enemies very far away and quest items. For example the other night my bro and I were doing WC and I could spot serpentbloom on the other side of the room which didn't even register on his 1080p display.
---
I'm not quite sure what you mean? So far everything he has posted has been pretty high production with good information imo. 
---
But the original FF7 wasn't turn based, tho...
---
Always loved 1k. The place felt so calm and somehow it was always late night when I was leveling there. The only thing I disliked was the really long distances. It really feels like it should've been lvl 40+ zone so that you'd have had a mount.
---
Cataclysm flooding it made me legit angry. Leveled through it later on and it was pretty fun but still I miss it a lot.
---
As you stated you and I both are part no of the no changes crew. And as long as that is maintained through Naxxramas then yes I would love content to be added to classic. I think it would honestly be amazing. That’s how old school RuneScape does, they kept the base 2007 game the same but added on to it. I don’t see why classic couldn’t be the same. So much potential. 
---
If you search for the things people have said in this sub you’ll see what I mean.  Mostly people nit picking.  I’m completely indifferent.  
---
Have to disagree with taurens having the better racials, I much prefer shadowmeld, it comes in handy so often in PvP.
---
There's a reason why they are always the least played class by far. I enjoyed leveling one on a private server, but I couldn't commit enough hours to make Feral work at end game.
---
I mean they could just barely increase gear power too... enough  so that players want to do the content but it doesn’t have to create a huge disadvantage for players who have Naxx gear. I mean eventually everyone will get through the content so we’d all be geared
---
Let me hijack this for a second .. is subtlety rogue viable in vanilla/classic PVP? I always hear people talking combat. I kinda hate combat. I mained a warlock in vanilla but I had a level 42 rogue by the time I quit a year post release, and I can't for the life of me recall what spec I played. I kinda think it was sub, but after years of retail sub playing, it's a blur. I did a lot of wpvp and "I'm a one man show" battlegrounds (forgive me), if that helps on what area of viable I'm saying 
---
Dood, this isnt the forums. It's a classic wow sub. CLASSIC WOW.
---
Not rape and pillage vanilla wow sub . if you want that go make that sub.
---
As you can see here, you are out numbered with people telling you to go away. There is enough to do on vanilla/classic for now. We dont need yourbullshitideas
---
Prep coin concede 
---
Desolace is my jam! When they de-desolaced it in cata it was a major blow.
---
If you're into those kinds of stark landscapes, you might like the salt flats west of salt lake city (where they set land speed records). Really eerie, alien, dead environment, but I think it's beautiful. 
---
Need more spreadsheets! Any classic spreadsheets please! Leveling data anything will love you karma karma
---
I'm on my second G502, there's just not a single mouse I've ever tried that even comes close.
---
Same thing for Prot Warrior.  BiS changes from encounter to encounter.  And some of the items listed are simply wrong.  For example, Ring of Defense and Hardened Stone Band are both worse than good Drakeclaw Bands (Drakeclaw gets random enchants, so you can get sexy things like "of Defense" or "of the Tiger" for tanky and TPS sets respectively).  And they're easier to get than the random world drops, since you can farm them by clearing I think 4 packs on the way to a pair of the drakes.  You can only do 2 of the 4 drakes without full clearing, but the 2 you can get to, 3 60's can farm their way to a lock-out easily.  A couple of lock-outs worth of farming runs will get you a pair of acceptable Drakeclaw Bands (I ran with a Monkey and a Stamina on the private server I tanked on).
---
Same thing for Fel Hardened Bracers (or Runed Golem Shackles) vs. Vigorsteel Vambraces.  Pretty sure I used T0 because I didn't have Runed Golem Shackles or the Stoneform Shoulders and DM wasn't out yet, so I paired up the T0 bracers and shoulders for the 200 armor set bonus.  But Vigorsteel is probably my 3rd choice, after Fel Hardened and Golem Shackles.
---
But even for the stuff that's more correct, there's a lot of flux.  Like I would never use Demon's Blood.  Force of Will is a definite BiS, but for your other trinket, Vigilance Charm and Mark of the Chosen would be my picks, depending on whether you need tanky or TPS.  Defense is great because of the crit chance reduction, but keep in mind that 3 Def from Demon's Blood works out to .36% avoidance and .12% reduced crit chance, as compared to 2% avoidance from Vigilance Charm.  So unless a crit is going to insta-gib you (Broodlord being the first chance of that), Vigilance Charm is going to save you oodles (4x) more incoming damage.  There is something to be said for even damage instead of spiky damage, and there does come a point where avoidance becomes dangerous (because when you avoid half the incoming attacks, 3 or 4 successful hits chained together can surprise healers and cause you to die), but by the time you're tanking encounters like that, you've got some raid gear and you definitely have OBT (Onyxia Blood Talisman) to pair up with your FoW.
---
Likewise with Golem Skull Helm vs. Gyth's Skull.  Gyth's Skull has a little more survivability, Golem Skull has way better TPS (giving up 32 armor, 2 stamina and 2 defense but getting 18 strength).  I would use GSH a lot more than Gyth's, but there are certainly times I would want to rock Gyth's, especially "of Fire Resistance" which would be your go to for all of MC until you get your T1 or T2 helm.  Kromkrush's Chestplate vs. Enchanted Thorium Breastplate.
---
Dunno why this got downvoted.  The list really is off.  But anyone that's serious about their tanking as a warrior is going to do the research and realize there isn't a single "BiS" for tanking anyway.
---
This pic is me too!
---
That's some wishful shit.
---
I was literally looking for exactly this lile an hour ago. I keepnseeing far too many warriors wearing the T1 shoulders for fury, when the truestrike are so much better in almosy every way. So I'm like, what is BiS for MC? Still Truestrike gg
---
HARP was nice, but then they killed it. But they also simultaneously buffed Shadowstep and that was SO FUN. Mutilate was way more difficult to play but scary as hell done well.
---
Unpopular opinion here but I thought thousand needles was an incredibly boring area both visually and as far as the content in it. Playing either as horde or alliance hasn't changed my perspective on that place. I just dont find it interesting at all.
---
&gt; If you need a healer backing you up that doesn’t mean you’re the best lol you can literally say the same about any class “if you have a healer backing you up.”
---
Not really. Warrior is by far the best class if you have a healer. And in BGs you typically have a healer. In 1v1 the warrior's main weakness is survivability. No self heals or anything like that, you basically just stand around taking hit after hit and then die. They still do really good damage even in 1v1. So when you add more people to each side and the warrior gets a healer their main weakness disappear. On top of that the already good damage output of a warrior is boosted even more if they take damage themselves, through increased rage generation. No other class scales like that in group fights. 
---
You really can't say the same about other classes. A mage or rogue with a healer does not gain nearly as much from grouping up like that. They are better going more or less solo. 
---
Yep. Although for retail I think that's a good thing, only problem is that it costs money, which obviously people weren't asking for. 
---
The level of entitlement on this sub is unmatched. 
---
What is the point of this thread?  
---
Are you going to make posts listing which classes beat other classes in 1.12 also? Or are you just bitter you can't cream everybody on your Xxshadowedgexx rogue like in other patches?  
---
Every class has its place and its counters, you can either learn them and play to your strengths, or not. Or just play something else...
---
&gt; but when someone gets the jump on you in STV it's pretty tough to turn it around.
---
The winning strategy is to always fuck with people first. Establish your dominance.
---
You forgot 'Any orc' in your list of bad matchups.
---
This is where alliance 29 twinks come to show off thier  skills. Because of the scaling of enchants and twink items. They get to fight green machines that are leveling spec, so they can finally have the upper hand in life. Just imagine that first feeling of success 🤣
---
Great video, but I guarantee you that they will not add additional content. 
---
If you watch the panels and read basically all the information we have thus far, they're going *very* out of their way to be truthful to the vanilla experience. New raids means new items, and new balancing / tuning the experience around that. Zero chance.  
---
&gt; If a shaman gets opened on before they put their totems down could they still get one shot?
---
No. Double no if you are orc, because you will almost always resist at least one stun.
---
Dispel is more important then windfury totem. Grounding totem is OK, but can't deal with AoE snares.
---
And the other thing to remember is that like you, there are plenty of Aussies out there playing.  Being on Asia time zones doesn't mean you can't raid in English.  In fact, I was in a Chinese guild in retail Vanilla and raids were conducted in English.
---
I don't see anything wrong with that. "Never change a running system."
---
People buy the Pokemon or Mario games because they know what they'll get. It's a good thing. I don't agree with innovating a franchise over and over again just for the sake of changing it. See what it did to WoW. 
---
True. I'm assuming Classic turns out feeling and playing as Classic should/did.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd **much** rather go a 1.13 rather than TBC. Kara is easily my favorite raid in wow. I once had a dream I was sitting in the audience watching red riding hood.  I just don't think it's worth the risk.
---
We already know Classic is a great game by itself.  It's still going to take a pretty hardcore guild to reliably progress through Naxx.  To be perfectly honest adding even more content almost seems realistically unhealthy.  The time-sink is real.
---
I guess we'll see how it plays out.  I still don't envision many people "finishing Naxx" anyhow so even more content may be pointless.
---
mages was the best PvP class in Vanilla, not warriors 
---
Another thing I love about 1k needle is the huge contrast between night and day. Looks awesome!
---
Pally, that bubble hearth though ;)
---
I'd appreciate a DM on better guidance. I don't have the min/max skills that some of the people have so I'm looking to learn anything I can.  
---
Druids aren't about topping meters, but they can melee, range, tank, and heal in a single fight. No other class can say that. They're a class for people who like complexity and flexibility rather than being at the top of a list.
---
Part of why im so receptive to having these additions is that i think people are really underestimating the effect of how theorycrafted Classic is top to bottom. 
---
Like you said Naxx will be brutal and dont get me wrong, its not a magically easy raid. However its going to get cleared by a farrr higher percentage than it originally was, and i think a lot of ppl are going to be borderline resentful of how meta/min maxed the game has gotten in every way.
---
For PvP there are many specs from dagger sub to any weapon sub, from full assa to full combat... What I suggest is you finding your play style. My play style for PvP usually ends up with a deep sub spec that gets cold blood from assa and just maximize cooldown efficiency. Some others enjoy vigor and spamming backstabs.
---
As for pve, you can only go combat if you wanna raid. Both dagger and sword combat specs outperform all others by a large margin. 
---
The correct question would be: Am I really Horde or Alliance?
---
The answers you seek are within you.
---
How do you think they would fuck it up? Their raid environment design team is clearly still very artistically capable. 
---
For tickets GM would whisper you, watch you and at times teleport you to GM island. I’ve only had the former two happen back then.
---
So many collect XXX quests with terrible drop rates tbh. Idk about horde but as Ally it was okay i guess.
---
Not to mention the dank buff
---
You’d be crazy to not bring druids
---
As the comments in this thread show, no one person should be putting together a BIS list. The most effective list is going to be one that is built as a community effort through a lot of discussion.  
---
I don't personally have the skills for it, but all the people in the comments saying this is wrong should Discord up with OP and start building a better list.  
---
What’s with this topping the charts mentality. It’s cancerous. 
---
It's because he wasn't a vanilla player.
---
Most people don't think about duel conditions since wpvp is rarely that balanced or fair, rogues live for the wpvp ganks, even if they don't beat any other class fairly , we both know rogues just need to wait for you to be low while fighting mobs to jump on u.
---
Besides, what's this 1v1 you speak of? I thought people rolled rogues to camp lowbies and make them ragequit. xd 
---
It is when they're a tauren
---
Ultimately, WoW is a themepark mmo were content is consumed. Any "solution" to the issue of the game dying after Naxx will only delay this. Not even by a particularly long time, either. Are you just going to keep adding raids, stacking them on top of each other indefinitely? Expansions have obvious issues that have been stated, and I like having everything in one world, but wiping the slate clean is necessary if you want to keep the game "active". 
---
Honestly, I'm fine with letting Classic WoW live out its life span and then fade away. Let the servers die. It's okay.
---
Heh. 
---
All specs are viable, so it's not complete.
---
We have quests sending us to the shimmering flats too. It's not like we just show up. And in that level range alliance and horde zones are the same. It's Stranglethorn, Arathi, Desolace, Alterac. Quests are generally the same too, just some small differences. 
---
not if you cannot respawn anywhere without being killed
---
The three centaurs that you have to kill for the quest were a bitch for me. For a Rogue I had trouble taking on three guys at first. I look forward to seeing it not under water. 
---
So you're saying their rep is entirely reasonable then?
---
what is the pvp solution for me as a level 20 getting ganked by a level 60?
---
It fucked over BM hunters and ferals too.
---
I also miss that armor.
---
Drop rates weren't that bad. The problem is you got a quest to get 10 feathers or something, and there's only 7 birds, and every spawn spot is camped by the other factions :D
---
Would be nice if the BiS list for ele wasn't focused on PvE damage... and actually had a relevant list for PvP / Solo where mail and armor matters...
---
so does nickelback.
---
I dunno man.   All I know is that if they do fuck it up it's unlikely they're going to release "Vanilla/Classic" again (in my life time) so for me personally it's not worth the risk. 
---
I dunno, the drop rate on that scorpid venom and those turtle shells.... And collecting like 30 parts of that rocket lol. That zone has some quests that are super important for the level range because the xp you get grinding them is crazy.
---
Who cares? This thread is about your own personal perfect server. Complaining that someone elses ideal scenario isn't your own (for **any** reason) is like.. a serious waste of time.
---
Its like telling a guy who likes redheads to watch out for their freckles. I would just assume the guy doesn't mind freckles....
---
I think he means everything is being killed so respawns are happening all around, rather than just static mobs you know are there
---
It's still a very fun and flavorful class though, the only true hybrid class through and through, it's got some rough edges but I feel people who gravitate towards this class are in it for the appeal of the identity rather than the result.
---
Most prefer to be specialists in a given field, druids are generalists , they do everything decently but never well, but that's what the class is tbh, tired of people trying to label this class into a specific role when it's basically all roles at once or a better way to describe it would be that vanilla had 4 roles not 3, dps/ tank/healing and utility. druids belonged to the 4th role and therein lies the flavor that was lost in retail after the removal of that role from the game.
---
Carrying 3-4 different sets is a given since you are all roles, that's the caveat but also part of the quirks, locks gotta carry mountains of shards, mages gotta conjure food and trade etc. each class has it's ups and downs.
---
Asking Blizzard nowadays to add new content for classic is like asking a dumb talentless idiot to add new details to a beatiful classic painting. They just don't have enought talent to live up to their old standarts. They will fuck this up 100% so just don't bother
---
Both were good at different things. Mage is more consistent across all types of PvP, but warrior is the most overpowered in battlegrounds for example. 
---
I never paid it much attention having gone through other zones to level at that range. When I later levelled a character using a guide that utilized quests in Desolace, 1K Needles and Feralas I gained a newfoun appreciation for these zones, and they're easily some of my favorite to this day. Getting lost in the forest of Feralas, not seeing another player for hours made me feel like I was on my own adventure and  is something I'll always treasure. 
---
Just wanna nudge in here and say tanking changed a lot in BFA, threat matters again and you cant keep AM up 24/7 (well some classes can), it's not been a popular change and now tanks have once again become a very rare commodity.
---
No complaints or anything, just like updating people
---
when did landsoul start working on spreadsheets? 
---
stealth not good enough ? you can't meld in combat in classic, tauren racials &gt; NE ones for druid.
---
But since classic will be starting with 1.12 talents it will be there on launch.
---
If we are to believe this, why isn't the gnome in the comparison a rogue to match the video? I think that debunks this. However, why the fart would they name the character July, that's some shady shit Blizz
---
Free action potion + rocket boots = problem solved.
---
ikr, mark rogues 100 yards away whenever you see them always makes them rage. x'D
---
delicious shaman tears. tastes really good with my BUBBLES and HEALS and PLATE
---
No doubt, a good hunter with engineering and potions was a force to be reckoned with in classic.
---
I was responding to the assertion that hunters in general were OP in lower level open world PvP. I think they could be if you were a particularly skilled player but the majority of level 35 hunters with skinning and 2g to their name weren't going to destroy you.
---
That's why I said I think they were pretty skill-based. High ceiling and low floor. The class itself wasn't so strong in that context that any scrub 12 year old playing a hunter would run around melting people.
---
Don't forget shaman trinkets remove stuns, if you're orc on top of that you don't really have to worry about dying in stuns, the biggest issue is keeping poison cleansing up , good rogue will try to break it asap to blind, but it gives you time to slow them and gain some distance/ drop it again and so on, overall I'd say the fight leans in the shaman's favor as long as you're not in greens.
---
BM hunters on the other hands.... best of luck :)
---
Personally, nothing really, it's not my kind of thing.         
---
But i'd like to point out that a vast majority of that thread didn't dislike streamers themselves, just their sometimes rabid fanbases.
---
Because you are the only player in the game
---
Why not just make your own level 1 on that server to join/run around with the raid or watch the 40 infernals?
---
Yeah its ezpz to just change what you were saying when someone points out how stupid it was.
---
&gt; By the time Naxx is out for a few months, i think itll be clear the server needs a jumpstart of new content
---
I disagree that there will need to be new content a few months after Naxx opens.  I remember there were still guilds working on MC and BWL when TBC launched.  That being said, if there were to be new content added onto classic OSRS style, if it increased the power curve even remotely, I would be out of there.  T3 was already way too powerful as it was. IMO Any new content should be power level T2 at most, with diverse stat distribution or different procs, but never more powerful than T3.
---
Lmao sniped dude u are so cool and sexy
---
&gt;hunter nightfall meme
---
Just put Nightfall on two of the offtanks since they can build threat just fine and swap to a shield if needed and avoid wasting an entire raid slot on a meme Hunter who spams all of his GCDs on rank 1 wing clip doing literally 90 DPS.
---
I want to say it's one of the first major PvP hot spots due to both factions having the same quests from the goblins there. The combination of rare quest targets and low drop rates for the targets that aren't rare makes a lot of people start fights.
---
As much as I love rogues (been maining it since vanilla untill the launch of bfa) people who think they will be Gods for playing them in vanilla are delusional. 
---
Launch of classic yeah but it was not in vanilla for a significant amount of time.
---
I think the same thing.
---
Summer is July to September technically. May is still Spring
---
People tend to forget just how long it took to get geared though.  Not only did it take a long time to get geared enough to beat the gear checks, but there was a constant cycle of recruiting due to players burning out or being poached and having to farm earlier raids to gear up and test new recruits.  Naxx40 was a guild killer, theorycrafted or not many guilds still couldn't complete naxx40 when they were level 70 in T4 gear. 
---
I too think it will launch closer to when kids go back to school. End of August early September.
---
I have a vague memory of someone mentioned something about it during Blizzcon
---
I dislike the streamers themselves. 
---
Level 8 twink pvp
---
#firebobbykotick
---
Because I’ll be playing my own toon, these are only examples of things that would make me put twitch on instead of Nerflix/Prime. In all honestly Im hoping to be able to experience these types of things on the server I roll on first hand. I understand that will require some luck on my end but fingers crossed.
---
But ally went there too? 
---
It exists in STV. The only difference is that you might have to interact with other people which vanilla wow is all about.
---
Exactly.
---
I would watch a streamer who kept leaping to their death from all the high places in Azeroth.
---
#noflyinginclassic
---
Here is my guess. Osconty may very well be a random name in the database and its coincidence that a gnome rogue killed a boss on July 16 in vanilla using the same random name. This is further backed by the third name which also seems like it would be random, Gaskeldo. The name July is most likely an Easter Egg and is most likely their target month, assuming no delays. I think 90% of all this is coincidence and the only thing they meant for us to find is the July part.
---
What are the best classes for wpvp while leveling? I will be on a pvp server and playing casually. 
---
No, I will not play hunter. My alt will be a druid
---
Still don't like paper guides rofl. There's also so much useless shit in those guides, like basic starter shit that anyone already knows.  
---
And I didn't change anything. OP said today, did I somehow change what OP was saying? I'm glad you attribute so much power to me.  
---
Oof the downvotes. I agree but it's mostly right. I don't know why he put +5 Weapon damage for enchant though, that's useless for druids especially compared to +25 agi
---
Well for starters stealth can only be used in cat form so sits behind a global cooldown, whereas shadowmeld can break target instantly. You can also eat and drink in shadowmeld.
---
25-30 se one parse for bwl? Hmmm. Anyone else seeing anything wrong with this?
---
I've learned to avoid Shimmering Flats as Alliance, haha.
---
Idk, really good Hunters make sure all fights happen on their terms using track humanoids, flare, trap, &amp; kiting. Most classes can only 1v1 a Hunter by abusing his deadzone so if you kite effectively and make people fight you from 40 yards away there’s not a lot they can do.
---
I agree that Hunter is a high skill class in PvP, it’s a more nuanced kind of skill, not about flashy cooldown usage but more about spacing, movement, and timing
---
After level 30 pretty much everybody levels in the same exact zones.
---
I hate the Barrens. It's too big, the quests were designed before Blizzard realized that 15 raptor spawn points scattered across the entire northern half of that gigantic zone maybe wasn't the ideal questing layout.
---
Ew? Interact with other people? I want a single player MMO.  
---
Oh thankfully there's BfA!  
---
It sounds like you actually do get why people like them and just disagree, which totally makes sense, but your comments are so retarded that people are downvoting them.
---
You're not doing a good enough job to trigger anyone. No one cares about your comments that much. 
---
It brings a tear of joy to my eye when I see my lock dots kill them shortly after they've killed me. I DIED WITH MY GLORY AND REVENGE
---
A stream of new born baby leopards would be interesting.  
---
I always enjoyed lifecast streams at gas stations, a lot of interesting people come through there.  
---
Cooking shows are also interesting on stream. I remember back on justin.tv there was a really good cooking show and the most amazing kitchen I've ever seen in my life.  
---
Aside from that I don't really watch streams.  
---
Oh... you meant regarding Classic WoW? Sorry I didn't even read your body of text.  
---
Same. I've never watched a streamer who I didn't think was putting on a total act for his audience.  
---
And, on that note, how could you possibly accept money from your fan base to get your car out of impound because you tried to drive to Blizzcon on a suspended license? There's no way I'd crutch on other people to make up for my life mistakes.  
---
Basically you hope you don't roll on a server with a bunch of dulls. ME TOO.  
---
There's NO way to know if you're going to, it's a honestly a gamble.  
---
I'll likely spend time watching FailureAnalysis stream. He's vanilla WoW developer Kevin Jordan (of Staff of Jordan fame, among many others). He mentioned that he's interested in playing WoW Classic and providing behind-the-scenes insights of the development of vanilla WoW as he plays through it. They'll certainly be some of the most unique and informative streams out there.
---
Idk. For sure ogre magi is a good position 5 pick but he's not really meta right now.
---
I think we agree on everything except the skill level of your average world PvPer. A really good hunter is mega dangerous and annoying to face, I just don't think there are lots of them out there.
---
Yeah lol, Shamans are kinda the same way. Not a lot of really good ones out there but you know it when you see it
---
?
---
It'll be okay Dad, your Classic experience will be okay, just take a deep breath.
---
Not going to happen just because it would lead to even more spec/racial imbalance outrage which will already be deafening at launch.
---
Blessing of Salvation solves that issue for one faction.
---
Horde tank TPS is a lot more random. If you get a few good Windfury streaks your threat can spike up 10-15% in just a few seconds.
---
Lots of Horde Warriors might burn themselves trying to push the upper limits of threat right as they get a Windfury/crit combo.
---
I have did not know he had these plans, definitely sounds interesting. Thanks for the info my friend.
---
I recently leveled a hunter. I owned STV 32-38, at least 100 kills. I died maybe 5 times and every time was someone at least 5 levels higher than me or a party of 2 or more.  Just keep that humanoid tracking on at all times and turn your camera backward when fighting a mob.  
---
Had a blast with lots of memorable fights, including a 3 or 4 minute +5 level pally duel where he used a Free action pot, bubble, LOH, and a health pot and I died due to running into mobs while he was at around 1% hp.  Hell of a fight.
---
&gt; It takes a certain finesse to work around your dead zone and keep people at an appropriate range. 
---
Pet stun and always being kiting is usually enough. However, the real secret for any low level PvPer is boots with +run speed on them.  Get those and kiting is about 10 times easier.
---
Until the warrior gets a wf crit and oneshots someone 
---
And yet here you are haha.  
---
Not trying to troll or start any drama or anything, just honestly curious, what's the point of any of the letters/symbols/etc after the T?
---
As far as taking content (or backporting as you call it) from Cata, while not explicitly discussed, i think most ppl on this sub would agree post Wotlk is where wow suffered a serious decline. Therfor im skeptical the wow remasters so to speak would reach that far. Nor am i interested in the 5 man disappointment that Grim Batol etc eventually became for example. My point being it seems like a non issue.
---
Im interested in a new take, or technically the old take, on what these dungeons/areas were supposed to be when first conceived. Kara is the only one thats been actually both a fully fledged raid and beloved, so i'd love that as is.
---
As far as cramming vanilla with content, naturally there has to be an end point and its not an all or nothing situation. Hell i'd even say Kara alone being ported in is almost likely. My point is that theres quite a portfolio to draw from and i hope they do something with it, even if its ultimately minor.
---
Btw the portal in Azshara was supposed to lead to a battleground!
---
Yeah i was actually a fan of heroic dungeons. Knowing what they would end up becoming makes me feel dirty just saying that
---
It is a generation gap. Streaming wasn't a thing when WoW came out in 2004, 14 years ago. This sub is loaded with people that played original WoW. A 12 year old that played WoW in 2004 is 26 now. The majority that played OG WoW old now. Old people don't watch streamers.
---
Yes on a fresh server, once again you want to have at least a buddy with you while you do those quests.
---
Oh god lol that tank "bis" list, please just leave tanks out of these.
---
Thank you, and yeah youre probably right. It is an interesting thing to think about though, and if theres any chance it rests on the fact that vanilla as we know it is essentially over after Naxx. 
---
But at this moment in time i certainly wouldn't expect them to say anything but "no changes".
---
You want to limit your gaming experience to only play with people biased on their sexuality welcome to 2019. Very inclusive have fun. 
---
Also where fuck do these new letters keep coming from???
---
ResidentSleeper
---
World of Warcraft 2 could very well extend from a re-envision of the universe after Classic. However that would require the total collapse of retail.
---
Might as well throw the entire alphabet in there for good measure.
---
Sounds like an unnecessarily stressful environment tbh, having to walk on eggshells every time you want to chat. I'd rather just be in a normal guild with people mature enough to handle banter.
---
Try DrDisrespect, hes pretty genuine.
---
Plenty of people will be playing classic, so i'm sure there will be plenty of people to form such a guild when the time comes
---
Well i pretty much agree with you. Im not trying to solve anything really. However for some reason people think that just because Naxx was the last raid released, going even 1 tier above it would completely break the game, and im not sure thats the case. 
---
I just wouldn't mind seeing an extra raid or two and figured i'd explore that.
---
This is why I made my own list for pre Bis for my druid. 
---
People only seem to Theorycraft, but seem to ignore the fact that the game itself is a whole different monster. 
---
That goes from bis lists to class and race choices.
---
The game is very different than what's inside your head. 
---
If a guild is running two off tanks like this for anything outside of progression. It will have bigger issues than deciding on who should be Nightfalling.
---
The reason why Hunter is a great choice is due to the fact that Hunters DPS ceiling is at times worse than a Shadow Priest, especially as raids progress. They’re mostly there for moral support and eating gear for what is otherwise deemed better class options for raiding, which isn’t practical nor optimal in 2019.
---
What else are they their for? That’s right, Tranq Shot. Why not make them NF as well? Increase their worth?
---
Fury Warrior on the other hand has a incredibly high DPS ceiling and with Protection Warrior a complete meme in 2019. Your guild shouldn’t be running a single one out of progression.
---
Thus, Hunter, at least Horde side. Is the best choice for Nightfall.
---
Shadowmeld cant break target in classic, it can only be used out of combat. Fake news.
---
For classic I dunno. If I wanted to get into PvP at some point I might watch a good PvP player. For PvE I don't have any interest in watching streamers for classic. I sometimes watch m+ streamers in BfA though, best way to get better at the game. 
---
So dal rend Arent the best weps for hunters on release, as you're never going to be allowed to need on them because of reasons rogues and warriors, instead you should get 2 1h axes from strath ud that gives Stan and agility.
---
Barbarous blade is from dire need maul which isn't open on release
---
Oh hey! I made that thread! I've been trilling around on reddit and the forums for a while seeing if anyone was planning a LGBT guild for classic. I think it may be worth contacting any active LGBT guilds in classic and seeing what their plans are. Otherwise, I hope this goes well!
---
I understand what you're getting at, but there have been many modern raids in retail that are impressive. In a vacuum, Blizz is still capable of making good content. 
---
However its their world and systems on a macro level that are trash in retail. In this instance, the world itself is already made.
---
You're likely to attract a lot of negative attention if you advertise this openly tbh. Just make it clear you don't want shitty people in your guild and remove/ignore shitters as they appear. Doesn't have to be so insular.
---
I'm limiting my guild-searching for casuals, we all need a guild of similar minded people to be comfortable.  Hope you get a good one!
---
It’s hard to really get feelers for this for two reasons: 1) it’s still a little early (but we’re getting closer every day!); and 2) this type of post is unfortunately a breeding ground for trolls. I believe someone just posted about not advertising this type of guild publicly. How are we supposed to recruit?!? 
---
It’s Reddit. What do you expect? Lol
---
Hey man thank you! Good luck to you. I think LGBT typically leans casual but not always. I’ll see what I can get, haha. 
---
Just because it can't be used in combat doesn't mean it can't break target. Druids are very good at running away. 
---
Saying it on the tin makes it easier and also lets people know if that's the guild they're looking for. If you have to guild hop to see if voice chat is going to be filled with people throwing slurs around you're going to get worn out after a few times and the game will stop being fun. 
---
Not a big fan of WoW's PvP system in general because it creates a subset of the playerbase that just idles in a capital city waiting for queues to pop. BGs already do this to some extent, and I don't see an arena making the situation any better.
---
Nothing looked insanely wrong except shadow flame is worse than chromatics for DW Fury and Onyxia Tooth isnt BiS by a mile.
---
Elemental Shaman is actually more optimal than Shadow Priest.
---
Shadow Priest literally has ZERO uses in a raid line up outside of Shadow Word: Pain, but if your guild is dumping resources just to make that debuff optimal for 75% of the game. Then good riddance. Your guild sucks.
---
Plus it's right next to a city with a bank/AH/Profession Trainers.
---
Get yourself every few lvls a better 2h wep, don't focus on other gear. 
---
Avoid quests that require you to walk a lot and always go for multiple quests in the area. 
---
Always try to be in combat, grinding in vanilla is a big thing.
---
Don't do dungeons if you want to powerlvl!
---
If you just started and don't know the quests by heart, don't expect to lvl fast.
---
Don't focus on professions if you want to lvl fast.
---
Try to camp the dragonslayer buff that it's given in the capitals city when the nepharian quest it's turned in by someone on your server. The 2h duration makes you a power house. 
---
&gt;I remember there were still guilds working on MC and BWL when TBC launched.
---
Well of course, but those people are way behind everyone else. Their existence has no bearing on the growing population of people who are hungry to actually use their tier 2.5/3 on something fresh.
---
I think people are severely underestimating the effect near perfect theorycrafting will have on the general population. A lot of people are going to be clearing Naxx.
---
Right? I never thought I'd see the reverse of the problem we already face.  
---
Keep dreaming. Not gonna happen.
---
&gt;The goal is to create a place that welcomes people from our community
---
You know, I didn't think we're going to agree on this view point but what you're describing is... WoW.  That is the common ground we all share and it shouldn't be made into something more ostracizing than that.
---
I've read the book 'The Guild Leader's Handbook' by Scott F. Andrews, and if you intent to create a guild I suggest you do as well, where he mentions things you shouldn't base a guild on.  Having a guild of only black people only and advertising it as such is the same conceptually as the guild you're describing.  It's never going to be taken well by the majority and you're painting yourself as a target.
---
I would never discourage someone from finding like minded individuals to spend their free time with.  Though, it is against TOS to discriminate against others based on their sexualities, this road goes both ways.
---
TLDR:  You should be recruiting players because they're sociable and want the guild to succeed, not because they're gay, etc.
---
Isn't there another "arena" (more like a cage match) in Gadgeton? Stepping into it allows you to attack other players (not sure if only opposing factions or ALL players) without guards killing you. 
---
Awesome! Sounds like heaps of fun. +run speed always makes a huge difference in PvP. I couldn't play my griefing 19 rogue twink without it 😂
---
You sound like a pretty decent player with a mindset for PvP. I think you'd hurt me a lot more than the average hunter if I ran into you in STV.
---
I love those tight world PvP interactions. So exciting.
---
There are many LGBT guilds on retail and on other games that are plenty successful. Thanks for your input though. 
---
You want a safe space and then you paint a huge target on your back.  You should be equally accepting of everyone and there wouldn't be a feeling of animosity.
---
Why am I painting a target on my back again? Let me remind you LGBT are not in power and thus not in any position to discriminate. Reverse discrimination isn’t a thing. We’re creating a safe space for ourselves. If that had bigots raging because they’re not allowed somewhere for the first time in their lives, so be it. :)
---
It's not harder. Each class just has a bunch of niche spells. A lot of the spells locked behind the different specs in retail where usable by all specs in classic. 
---
Like a frost mage can cast fireball, fire blast, arcane missiles, etc. Being frost spec just means he gets bonuses on his frost spells, and depending on his talents access to frost-specific spells like ice block. 
---
In a raid environment he would still more or less only cast frostbolt. It really isn't difficult at all compared to perfectly executing the frost rotation in retail, minimising movement and so on. (even though frost in retail is easy as fuck)
---
PvP has a way higher skill ceiling though, where a lot of the extra spells come into play. It's very different from retail PvP, but I can't say if it's harder or not. 
---
genuinely a piece of shit, yeah
---
Do you have for other classes? It’s pretty good
---
Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.  There are plenty of guilds that have monitored chat and have family friendly environments.  Plenty of people play with there children even.  To say you're only safe from slurs if you unfairly reject people because they aren't gay, etc. is ridiculous.
---
On vanilla, I had the rep for my cat mount for my gnome at level 43. Only possible if you do every single quest including the one where you get that staff that turns you into a fulborg... wish i had kept that.. I'll try to do better this time. 
---
I also can remember that the both 1h axes in Strath are BiS
---
I just finished that zone. I’m always excited to head there I just wish there was more in the dirt area and less in salt flats
---
I realize that there are offensive guilds on retail that reject people based on sex.
---
Yes. White straight males are the real victims. You’re completely right. You’re so offended! PepeHands. 
---
Have a good day, buddy. 
---
I would only watch streamer ganking other popular streamers.
---
That loose scrollwheel wiggle is normal for all the Logitech mice that has the non-step scroll wheel. If someone says their mouse doesn't do that then they're not shaking it correctly.
---
I've used the g500 including all later iterations since release back in the day. It has always been like that, even back in vanilla which is a funny apropos.
---
What's that blue thing... doing here?
---
Not realy, classic was about the journey to endgame.
---
If people want high cometive endgame you got retail, most of the people i know will just reroll as we reach endgame/beat endraids
---
Doubling or tripling the active sub count should be enough right? right?
---
"Serious guilds" are going to have 2 - 3 druids. 
---
Any guild worth its salt recognizes that gearing an additional tank takes time and resources, where as gearing a feral tank with gear you would've disenchanted otherwise takes relatively few resources from the guild.
---
The same is true for Resto druids. Having less gear competition is good for guild growth and morale. Druids have the most efficient mana cost/healing spell in the game, the best single target and AoE "Oh Shit Button" heals, and Innervate and battle rez.
---
There's a lot more to guild success than raw numbers, which is why druids are constantly overlooked as lesser-- their power is in their versatility and utility.
---
Tl;dr - Stop perpetuating the stereotype that druids are any less effective or needed by guilds than any other class.
---
Let's be honest, Resto druids are ALWAYS the most in demand role in every guild 😏...
---
I just don't really like streams/streamers.  The only thing I did actually watch a lot of was the very first Twitch Plays Pokemon because that was cool to see it all happen with thousands of people.  So I guess I'd watch Twitch Levels to 60.
---
I want my old g5. The new g502 is a joke.
---
You can't argue with crazy.
---
You're not allowed to play with me because you're gay = offensive 
---
You're not allowed to play with me because you're straight = Reverse discrimination isn’t a thing
---
Stop trying to act like you're not offensive because you're gay or whatever.
---
Are you actually retarded or just pretending to be? He didn't say anything of the like and you're overreacting. Discrimination isn't okay, doesn't matter against who.
---
Will it make you happy if we allow allies? Meaning, straight people can join as long as they’re not assholes and support our community. Is that enough to appease the white cis patriarchy? Please keep me posted, this’ll keep me up at night. 
---
New guild looking for dedicated raiders only = appropriate 
---
New guild looking for gay people only = offensive 
---
New guild white straight mails only = offensive/doesn't exist
---
I mostly agree except the LFR part. No "hardcore" player would do LFR. It is specifically made to let casuals do the raids without actually putting any effort into it. It's in no way an effective use of your time, and the only people who does it are people who for whatever reason can't do a normal raid. Usually because they are bad, sometimes simply because they are scared of the group finder or whatever. If you have limited time to play the game you wouldn't waste it on LFR. 
---
&gt;anyone join as long as they’re not assholes and support our community
---
There fixed it for you.
---
You sure doesn't know a lot about treating people fairly for someone that needs a safe space.
---
Thank you for mansplaining me words. What would I do without you?! 
---
Again, have a good day, bud. 
---
Classic is Classic, not alternate WoW 2.
---
Gurubashi.
---
You're the only one her being offensive.  
---
Most LGBT guilds accept straight/cis people, and even OP mentions allowing allies. But LGBT spaces exist (in real life and online) for a reason. It's just nicer, sometimes, to be in a group of people you know will respect you and not be weird about it. WoW is a social games and you enjoy it more when you trust the people you're playing with. Not having slurs thrown around is the baseline expectation and even then it's not often met.
---
I don't watch WoW streams and can't think of much reason why I would. Maybe to see how a hardcore guild farms raids to help my guild get it done quicker.
---
Deathbringer + Windfury is also the best for orc warrior threat per second in the early stages but I get that's a niche case
---
I have 1080p/144hz 24" VA and 2nd monitor 1440p/60hz 27" IPS, I will try the game on both for sure. While the VA has better black, everything else looks better on the IPS.
---
"You don't have to view this game only from a bg premade or pure duel or hardcore raid perspective, vanilla has much more than just endgame, the world exists and unless you are doing a R14 grind you will live in that world far more than you will in any endgame of choice."
---
I like this quote.
---
In terms of the carrying 3-4 sets. Is that the same in PvP? I can't imagine that it is the case due to the fact that you can't change gear in combat right?
---
Well I loved BC so of course i'd enjoy that, but I'm not the one having to pay for all these servers and work being done. Hope it happens though.
---
It doesn't have to be on the guild charter that only straight cis guys can join. If the space is hostile to gay people, women, etc then only straight cis guys are going to be left. This applies to literally any group. You know that tumblr doesn't have any rules against homophobia, racism, etc? That doesn't mean the website isn't hostile to that point of view.
---
Yeah that's the 1, dal rend doesn't give any good stats for hunters, iirc dalrend gives str, +def and sword skill
---
O7 Nazjatar 
---
Ah yes, we can't start the day, or end the day, or go an hour of the day, without one of these posts.  
---
&gt;And the reality is that mentioning in any way that your guild is okay with lgbt players or that you won't tolerate homophobia is going to get you negative attention.
---
This is a fact and OP refuses to acknowledge he's painting a target on his back, even went so far as to simply insult and personally attack me instead of making valid points.
---
Someone makes off color sexist comments after being asked to stop, tell them "I don't think you're a good fit for our guild" and kick them.  Making a big deal about what sex people identify as when they ask to join is the wrong way to go about this.
---
Which is what what I like the idea of, being able to DPS with a combination of wrath, moonfire as well as kitty cat dps but then to have one of the healers struggling and be able to get out of the fight and start throwing out some healing around the group. 
---
The spec that interests me is 1/29/21. Is this viable throughout PvP, and is it something that I could use in a non hardcore raiding guild and still be a useful asset?
---
&gt;If the space is hostile to gay people, women, etc then only straight cis guys are going to be left.
---
This can be easily solved by having monitored chat without bringing IRL issues like sexual identity into the game.
---
Why does this have to go farther than we're mature, we act like adults, and we don't discriminate, would you like to join?
---
wow thats a lot of work, thanks!
---
More complex mechanics in vanilla such as threat, mana, off-tanking, CC, purging and cleansing, buffing, debuffing, etc. was why DPS didn’t have all the focus and importance. As WoW started to remove these things, the game became all about numbers. How much DPS you did or how much you could heal was your measure of “how good” you were.  
---
This I think is the biggest hang up that MMO players new to vanilla (and other older MMOs) have. Resulting in the “why would I want to play Pally/Shaman/Druid/Hunter” mentality. I’m not sure if those people will have a good time in Classic
---
No, you're being a weirdo. There are obvious reasons why explicitly LGBT-friendly guilds exist that you're ignoring because you don't actually care, which is fine, because you don't have to join these guilds. LGBT-friendly guilds have existed for years and we've been dealing with these criticisms for just as long. The reason why you think OP is painting a target on their back is because you're the one who felt the need to blast them for something that doesn't impact you in any way. If you don't want to join a guild where there might be a larger percentage of gay people than straight people, you can join literally any other guild on your server.
---
The content isn’t designed the same. You don’t even have to monitor threat and mana in retail. It’s mainly difficult because a game not designed for movement and mobility keeps asking you to avoid things like it’s a Mario game or a schmup
---
This is the last time I’ll be answering one of your post because it seems you’re just seeking attention. It is obvious that you lack the empathy or willingness to truly see the issue for what it is: a *persecuted* minority wants to enjoy a video game with people who won’t freely and often sling slurs in Discord for amusement, which happens in literally 95% of discords across the board. 
---
I’m sorry that you feel excluded, but here’s the issue: this *isn’t about you,* and your cis white male fragility. This is about us feeling safe and comfortable in an environment we deem ideal. As a minority who still gets murdered for who we are worldwide, I think we’ve earned the right. 
---
I’m sorry you disagree. But we don’t care. 
---
Goodbye. 
---
Listen, I keep a lot of info on my computer for reminders for post tier two gear. What's important first is what gear is available. I'm on my cell trying to fall asleep but I'll give you some specifics.
---
Most people will tell you 8% hit is fine, you should shoot for 11% minimum and 14% maximum, the reason is there's a lot more diminishing returns after that in the right circumstances but this number is relatively easy to hit.
---
Most people will tell you to prioritize strength after this, they are absolutely wrong in this regard. The main damage that comes from fury is from his rage management, white auto attacks in particular, more strength will make those hit harder but what you need to keep your cooldowns on CD is Flurry.
---
Any critical hit special causes the next three auto attacks to attack faster. However, this stat is much less important than hit because you can easily buff it to it's required target with consumables, roughly 30% it's pretty good even as high as 34% but after that it's better to upgrade for strength.
---
So to be clear, Hit+crit&gt;weaponskill&gt;strength by long shot for preraid and tier 1+2
---
Functional fury dps requires you to hit and crit at least once every three hits, as far as rage dump goes, whirlwind is almost not worth using, depending on your gear.
---
Most people will also tell you a slow mainhand is necessary which is also absolutely wrong, the logic is that a slow mainhand will make your instant strikes hit harder, but you only have one instant strike which is whirlwind which is a 10 second no damage added CD. As far as rage goes you're better off using heroic strike.
---
People will argue that one heroic strike will do less damage with a faster weapon which is wrong, it adds the same damage which is not altered by crits, if a 1.5 damage weapon swings twice and a 3.0 damage weapon swings once, they do the same damage, if all strikes add heroic strike, you're still trading the same rage for damage per use, that doesn't mean you need to use two heroic strikes for the 1.5 speed weapon. The only argument then becomes a faster weapon when rage dumping will out threat the slower weapon, but given the same amount* of rage it's just a more spread out amount of threat.
---
Managing threat as fury is tough when you do too much dps, but here's a tip, when you hit those hit+crit numbers you can spec into buffed cleave which adds the same + damage as heroic strike but adds no additional threat and hits a second target for a little more rage, making your extra rage an investment in lower threat generation.
---
Finally, weaponskill at 309 at least is absolutely necessary, it did in fact work up to 315 on retail but private servers unanimously decided on 310 to be the soft cap with different math. Weaponskill is supposed to reduce (and in retail nearly remove) glancing blows on raid bosses, which are iirc a 40% chance for any attack to not crit and deal much less damage(80% less? I forget.) 
---
With 310 in your weapon you reduce this to 10% making your hit/crit table much more effective at maintaining flurry since there's a lower chance to not crit. 
---
This makes playing human warrior the best race for PVE dps, edgemasters handguards worth a fortune, Maladath a big bid item for both rogues and fury, and actually makes Hakkari Warblades one of the best best best weapon sets you can have for the rest of the game, iirc we mathed them out as like number 4 in the best weapon sets, I think they were above CTS+Maladath too, not above GM swords and AQ sword+Nax sword.
---
Another note about weapons, you can absolutely play daggers if you get the weaponskill gloves and belt, the stats are all that matter and you can get some extra crit from MC daggers if nobody picks them up.
---
Anyway, to critique the post already listed here, getting strength only slots in the first two tiers and especially preraid is just bad advice, if you're only playing warrior you'll be strapped for cash every step of the way from craftable armor to consumables, it's a painful existence that only really starts to benefit in AQ40. You'll always be top Dps by a mile though, even with pro's.
---
There's 2% hit shoulders, gloves, lionheart helmet, there's a 1.5% crit and 1% hit legs, 1% hit bow, 1% boots and belt, 1%/1% bracers, onixia neck is 1.3%/1% hitnCrit, rings
---
If you literally get hit on every slot you'll barely hit 13% hit, but with Consumables you'll have crit stones. Mongoose, World buffs, songflower, ect. Just the cheap critstones and mongoose is 7.5% so crit is easy to hit.
---
Rage flow is really the goal with fury dps, it keeps Bloodthirst on cooldown and let's you heroic strike right up to and under the tanks threat, if the tank can't keep up he's a bad tank, trust me, but then you spec into cleave.
---
Also running speed increase on boots is necessary, so is double crusader, time your cooldowns together, use deathwish twice per boss, once at the start when you get crusader(s) and once during execute spam.
---
Always stack consumables including strength pots.
---
Probably roll another class for farming gold first like Hunter/Mage/Rogue/Druid. I recommend a mage with engineering so you can aoe groups of level 55 mobs for vendorloot and then sell to your robot.
---
You don't have to buy Devilsaur set if you get Voones Vicegrips and  one of two pairs of blue pants with hit%, edgemasters is the big money sink but being human with swords can last you until Maladath or AQ20 or ZG or MC Dagger gear.
---
I lost an hour of sleep to tell you this, take my advice.
---
Most guilds are like this to some extent. Most multiplayer games are like this. Who do you think is "monitoring" the chat? The reality is that if you're a straight cis dude, telling the people you're playing with to cool it is harder than shrugging it off as banter, which is what happens 95% of the time.
---
I’d rather they open additional servers with Burning Crusade and then WotLK. Progression servers are really popular with Everquest
---
I don't think I'd use freeze honestly.  I'd probably spec bm to intimidate then survival to entrapment and always keep a frost trap down.  It's a virtually guaranteed escape.  
---
 beast master hunters pet would kill my rogue while the hunger was stunned. Lol 
---
You’d think they’d want us “snowflakes” out of their guilds. Us self-segregating is a good thing for literal bigots like him. But they probably haven’t thought this through enough. They just lash out with their verbal diarrhea. 
---
I realised the only streams are like are for 1v1 games like Starcraft 2 or hearthstone. I find when watching other games with many players in it I feel like I’m missing out on parts of the game by following only one point of view. So yeah I’m not really interested in watching wow streams. 
---
Playing the WoW I fell in love with again.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT#Other_variants
---
It has gotten a little long. Once you get to acronyms like LGBTTQQIAAP and LGBTTIQQ2SA... 
---
I think you have a point TBF and this is exactly the reason companies normally don't innovate and just copy other successes. Right now, the success seems to be the mobile gaming platform and modelling every game after a slot machine, of all things.
---
giving us more raids in the classic zones could be nice. sooner or later we would come to a point when everyone has everything and there is no more stuff to do. on the other side people play private servers for ages and dont get bored. so time will tell.
---
This is bait.
---
Yeah I think something like that makes sense. Only problem is the server population might not support being split up like that. So you might have to do server merges as a result. 
---
It's really great to see so many responses again. Can't wait for Classic WoW! I do what little I can to help out the community. 
---
I'm a father to three sons (8, 5 and 3 y old) and living in a modern western country that means the household and family life is 50+ % on my shoulders. I'm working two part-time jobs at the side of studying astro physics at a respected university.
---
With this in mind I just wanted to say that I will respond to the posts that contributes to the community and the sheet. I really am super busy IRL, so it may take some time but I will respond and update the sheet accordingly.
---
However, post like "uh the tank preraid items are crap", "that item is way off" etc. won't be responded to. 
---
I mean, I'm pretty sure your intention is marely to get some attention for softcore trolling. If you really do want to contribute at least follow up the comments with some facts to back up your theory or suggest changes.
---
I agree with this, it’s a better option and makes more sense than adding new vanilla content. 
---
Persecuted minority.  We're all gamers here so get your labels out of here.
---
We're all anonymous here on the internet and here you are trying to label everyone and segregate gamers because you're insecure.  I'd love to hear how you assumed white male by the Ohyuckie user name.
---
There is nothing wrong with not wanting to hear slurs on Discord but that has nothing to do with anyones sexual identity.  Explain the link to guilds on WoW to minority murder worldwide.  Like that's something I should care about.
---
Okay, but what's the point? Like doesn't everyone fall into 3 categories, Straight, LGBT, or None? I always thought that the LGBT community was there to fight for equality and their rights and stuff, so what rights are Asexual or Pansexual or whateversexual people fighting for? I honestly don't understand...
---
I guess it depends on what those guilds want out of the game.  I know I love farming raids until I've got full tier sets and the way loot works in vanilla it could take me 3-6 months to complete depending on dkp, luck on drops and how many other rogues are in the raid.  I still to this day have not completed my tier 2 set despite being a progression raider from vanilla to wrath.
---
Why do the BiS trinket for bears change from Smoking Heart of the Mountain to Head of Onyxia during stage 1-2 and then back to Smoking Heart of the Mountain for stage 3-4?
---
Shouldn't it be Smoking Heart of the Mountain through all stages??
---
But you didn't answer my question, when was it the case that a large corporation existed without capitalism?
---
Also, isn't America's health-care system a good example of how free-market capitalism goes wrong? We pay more for health-care but we're way sicker than any other economically developed country and that's because the system is built for profit instead of for the health of the people.
---
The chat would be monitored by the guild leader and officers, discord even has tools that auto delete comments with specific words in them.  It's fairly straightforward once you set it up.
---
I'm still not seeing the link between sexual identity and people shrugging off slurs as "no big deal."  I think men understand the "C" word is offensive even if they don't have one and it doesn't effect them.  You just have to take the moral high ground, draw the line in the sand early, and enforce your views.  I would prefer to see people do this without robbing them of their anonymity and having a what's your gender circus in trade chat.
---
Just curious. What do you think is wrong with arena and heroic dungeons? Never heard anyone complain about that before. 
---
it's quite strange that people rarely mention the consequences of flying mounts. They really fucked up the feeling of being in a huge world.
---
I dunno, winning is pretty fun
---
Also it's probably way easier for Blizzard to just recreate TBC (and wotlk), while also knowing people will love it.
---
lots of small time streamers feel genuine, but I do agree that 99% of massive streamers are complete actors. 
---
Wow rlly makes u think
---
Jin rings and rag cloak is better for Hunter (alliance) in stage 2 than the items you have listed.
---
while i agree with what you said id also point out that when we talk about which classes are able to achieve top dps (again, where top represents the very top) it seems obvious to me we are talking about raid conditions that will allow these dps values to happen in the first place.
---
We're all just gamers as it see it.
---
Unfortunately, some insecure people need to label and segregate others instead of simply playing the game for fun... like you know, games were intended for.
---
Warlock is great. Voidwalker sac + fear
---
Why feel bad for alliance who are "stuck" with Loch?  [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/0/0a/Stonewrought\_Dam\_Front\_side.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101018045739](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/0/0a/Stonewrought_Dam_Front_side.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101018045739)
---
14 days ago I bought a new mouse and I complained that nothing had been able to replace my MX518.
---
Regretting that purchase a bit right about now.
---
i just adjusted the value of my comment to yours. I mean in all seriousness what is 
---
"I think the idea is that they are relevant the most."
---
even supposed to mean? like... sure they are not best for pve and not best for overall pvp but they are "relevant" the most? what?
---
you shouldnt expect high effort answers on low effort posts.
---
Is that available for horde? I cannot remember.
---
&gt; I lost an hour of sleep to tell you this, take my advice.
---
Yeah no shit. Holy shit go to bed LOL  
---
No. The horde can get the Ungoro Crater Dino mount. 
---
This has already been discussed a milion times before in here. But yeah, from the Blizzards point of view, this makes the most sense for me. They went into classic because its a huge money opportunity for relatively low effort for the development team. Same thing would apply if they released TBC and Wotlk later. Those 2 expansions are almost as popular at vanilla itself. And it would also give them an option what to do once they run out of vanilla content. We cant so much else than speculate at this point though.
---
I could see new Tier 3 content, as long as it's to give sets to the specs that don't have them yet.
---
*ice block*
---
You got a name for me? Can 't seem to find it
---
This. read it. 
---
I was able to take down my first level 60 with my level 40 something BM hunter.
---
Loved pvp on it so much I ended up grinding Stone Guard rank in my 40s
---
Dude I'm fucking dead.
---
Holy shit dude ... thats a fucking nightmare Scenario
---
guess the only way would be to find a new Party via global Chat that saves you
---
but yeah in General I would most likely skip dungeons aswell, maybe if im playing like hunter to FD/run out and are a bit overleveled, but that would be the Maximum. Big Problem here really is, that People tend to only clear the Minimum amount of adds. That means as soon as you make a wrong step, you got a new pack on you
---
I could see Hyjal being more of an open-world raid. It wouldn't be instanced but it would still be designed to be done in a group.
---
Where's the ally quest hub there? 
---
&gt; If they added content with gear stats higher than Naxx
---
I haven't found a single other person suggesting gear with higher stats than Naxx. Most people I've seen have suggested padding out the existing tiers, not adding new ones.
---
I'd be pretty surprised if Naxx level raiding population hits 5%.   
---
. 
---
im always a fan of arid landscapes. my current favorite zone in retail by now is vol'dun for that same reason
---
I mean that model has worked out fairly well for old school RuneEscape. While maintaining the purity of vanilla is important, I can't deny that I wouldn't be very curious about what a post-Naxxramas WoW would look like if taken in a very different direction than what happened.
---
And then you learn to love the Barrens, explore abit and figure that the mountain south of the slugde fen is postively infested with raptors. There are like 20 raptors on and around the mountain.
---
Why does sexual orientation matter in a video game? Just freakin’ play man 
---
The whole BiS concept sounds so dumb to me. I wish it was designed in a way where there was nothing that was the all round best and it came down to your play style, role or even situation at the time. It just devalues the whole experience into a number which you either have or don't have.
---
Poison cleansing totem only ticks every 5 seconds, you can take it down after blinding,
---
There’s no such thing as the white cis patriarchy. Quit virtue signalling
---
Personally I revel in it, because its to hordeish like the Durotar miniRP game with Rexxar. Only sand, desert, arid climate. 
---
There isnt supposed to be much and thats what I like. 
---
I would like it if the difficulty of content scaled faster than the loot it provided. You want gear that's better than Naxx? Then you and the rest of your raid better be both well geared and well skilled, far more so than is required to complete Naxx.
---
It would be a good way to counter the loot treadmill effect.
---
Also, some blue items from, for example, lvl 40 dungeon, are better for some specs, that the lvl 60 epics.  So the color and lvl it drops on  ( or the ilvl) do not determine how m much power it will give you. 
---
Shadow word pain? lol. You are probably thinking about shadow weaving, giving you the benefit of the doubt.   
---
Regarding the debuff, it is a quite good debuff. Infact most guilds that don't use a shadow priest use a holy priest to get it up instead. Gimping that holy priest. And a tryhard shadow priest are not that far behind the classes it competes, which would be ranged DPS obviously. [This](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=763521) guy for example have done 834 DPS on patchwerk, and before you mention gear you should know that shadow priests get pretty damn close to their max potential DPS quite early compared to other classes, considering they can get Lok'amir with 84SP(!) in BWL and they also only need 6% hit to get capped. So it is not really a huge sacrifice to bring a shadow priest if you look at actual boss performance, the biggest issue is they can't really keep up on trash due to mana issues and since speedclears seems to be the benchmark nowadays on classic servers they get shafted.   
---
I am really confident that a shadow priest with equal gear will beat a elemental shaman on most fights in terms of DPS. Especially without luxury items such as neltharions tear. And a Elemental shaman brings nothing unique at all, they only bring another set of totems but you can just bring another resto shaman instead.   
---
Shadow priest is not something left over from 2006 either, they were popularized on private servers rather than retail afaik. 
---
Microsoft inteli 3.0 was the best gaming mouse ever made.
---
Hi. Faerie fire would like to fuck your day in the ass. 
---
What do you mean an easy target? It's a tab targeting MMO.
---
I'd watch a stream of someone hardcore raiding on a Best Buy laptop.
---
Haha I can image if I duelled a decent mage 100 tines is maybe win 5-10
---
Nah, I just dont fight locks unless I have advantage lol 
---
It’s definitely easier to spot a Tauren in the distance or around foliage when world pvping.
---
Think he's talking about hit boxes, as in, melee range. Nameplates solve any targetting issues. 
---
*gets out of face*
---
The only people who say stuff like this are the people who've never had someone make it matter. Those who have had that experience likely want to avoid it and be with like-minded people (unsurprisingly like anybody else). Almost like it could make a good guild or something.
---
I don't know if it's just pservers or the horde in general, but there are an absurd amount of people that I wouldn't ever want to be associated with (the gamer word spamming types).
---
Horde or Alliance for the guild?:) And thanks for the BiS list!
---
So? Can't a man be passionate about something if he wasn't there at the start? I don't get why Reddit has such a hivemind negativity about a person. We are discussing Classic here, not Vanilla.
---
FYI, I don't like TipsOut, but then again I never really enjoy watching/listening to people talk more than an hour about the same topic in some kind of echo-chamber. That's the same for Soccer talkshows.
---
WoW Classic enthusiasts: "We will accept no changes, we want pure Vanilla!"  
---
Also WoW Classic enthusiasts: "We want new content added after the cycle is over!"
---
are you really tap targeting in pvp. 
---
I really, really like this Grim Batol idea. With old gods, black dragons, red dragons, maybe some dwarves and orcs? It could either be like SM or BRD (or why not both?)
---
Think its venomhide raptor
---
Currently playing on 35" 3440x1440, 100Hz panel. Cant complain, gives me options to spread out addon data in the sides, while still having full vision of my char and surroundings.
---
i gotta say i dont realy like thousand needles. dunno.
---
1k needles is pretty boring tbh, everywhere you look you see the same boring brown color and then theres some pillars that takes years to find the correct way to the top and then theres the elevator bosses and the fact that every alliance player lvl 42-44 will run through the place to get to tanaris and ungoro
---
Nobody knows if I’m gay or lesbian or whatever when I play games online because I don’t go around labelling myself to everyone. Do you see the straight people do it? “Oh hey guys my names Matt, I’m straight btw”  
---
Why are you even asking questions when this sheet recommends lvl17 BoE ring as tank Pre-bis and Dal'Rend + Flurry Axe for furies?
---
I mentioned that because it's why his content isn't very accurate to how the game actually was. Private servers are broken versions of the retail game, fundamentally flawed at their very core despite how accurate they can get. It's easy to tell the difference as a veteran player, and that's the reference point he always uses.
---
That was added in wotlk if not mistsken
---
I think I spider!
---
I mean, even in vanilla the difference was SO small it wasn't worth anything in pvp/pve.
---
The biggest problem was doors. 
---
See, there's your problem. You can't have a conversation like an adult because you pretend you're being attacked while I've been polite and resort to name calling and pouting like a child.
---
I wouldn't want you in my guild because you're an offensive person with backwards morals that refuses to treat people equally.  The LGBT community would be ashamed to have to represent some of the best people that I know, by dumbing it down to calling names, personal attacks, and sexual profiling.  You have no authority here, not because of your sexuality but because you're a shitty person and no one wants to hear the trash that comes out of your mouth.
---
Dude don’t act like WoW servers are utopias that aren’t full of hateful shit. It’s a cess-pool.
---
I can EASILY understand how people want to find a tight-knit group who can respect each other. This goes for all kinds of demographics who aren’t amused by the immature garbage that comes from so many WoW players. I’ve left many guilds on private servers just because of what kind of language was encouraged in guild chat. It made me consider making my own.
---
This is why OP stated opening the guild to allies. It’s not about discriminating based on sexual identity, but rather excluding dickheads, and THAT is something we all have a right to do.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
It really depends on how well vanilla is received. If they indeed get couple millions subs back from it, they might actually want to develop more content for vanilla and its design.
---
You should build and expand without breaking older stuff.
---
Another issue would be the economy would not be developed, as the AH prices would increase massively if made available to the TBC characters (more gold overall). If the AH was not available to them, then the TBC economy would be void of all vanilla items?
---
Like the premise tho - I think more likely there would be natural progression into TBC server, with a new classic server created in its place (or at least I'd hope)
---
trust me, streamers channels wont die if they get corpse camped for an entire stream. For the first hour the entire viewerbase will make fun of the streamer for dying and when they get a bit bored they'll come to the streamers rescue which will result in a giant pvp event
---
Well we know after a good few months of classic (after the final content "release") people will start demanding blizzard to make a bc server.
---
Well not really the data in tips video is from raids not a magic vacuum. He was talking about Naxx not Molten Core
---
&gt;It’s not about discriminating based on sexual identity
---
Did you even read the title of the post?  That's literally what this is.  Read OP's comments on this thread, throwing out mansplaining, snowflake, white male privilege comments, and talking about him being a minority and LGBT people are being killed worldwide.  This is OP talking here, go read it.
---
You can have a guild with monitored chat and kick people that are offensive without having a sexual identity check at the door.  For the record, OP is only humoring the idea of straight people even being allowed in, because he's the one that's offensive.
---
As long as you go through all pf Teldrassil/Darkshore/Ashenvale etc as early as possible you'll likely hit exalted long before 60.
---
&gt; There’s only a minute amount of filler content that could be added pre-Naxx
---
I'm counting at least 6 potential new pre-Naxx raids, and that's just to give tier sets to the existing specs that don't have them (for tiers 1, 2, and 2.5). If they wanted they could go a step further and promote some weird or entirely new specs that just didn't have the support. There could be a Melee-Hunter set, a Succubus-Warlock set, a Gladiator-Warrior set, a Hybrid-Druid spec, a Lone Wolf Hunter spec, etc.
---
Nah, I have a bunch of macros that bake target nearest target into my regular abilities. How else would I guarantee the sap opener in RvR?
---
Might be, its just the winterspring counterpart...
---
Never got either back in vanilla, just wanted to share the name
---
What you are saying about glancing blows is wrong. You are not reducing the chance to land a glancing blow with weapon skill. You reduce the damage penalty. The chance to land a glancing blow is a static value (40% on raid bosses) and will never crit. 
---
makes no sense, the item database is the same
---
Making a point that LGBT folks are magically less offensive or that anyone else that isn't LGBT doesn't have empathy is a dog shit argument.  There is no correlation between being a decent human being and someone's sexual identity.
---
What is the skill cap like for tanking?
---
Almost like one of these things is assumed to be the default (and it is statistically). People often talk about more than just what's going on in-game in guilds. Including their SOs; and many times have I talked to a guildies wife/husband in voice. So even if it wasn't explicit it's not completely unknown. You're probably not surprised when it's explicitly revealed someone is in a hetero relationship. You probably are when it's not. When people are surprised they often comment about it. And this is where I think we can find agreement, it shouldn't be a big deal. But if you foster a situation where someone can't be openly and explicitly gay there's going to be some idiot whose really surprised and making a big deal out of it.
---
You're going to make his head explode.
---
There is also [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#) druid item list I see floating around every now and then. But that's all I know of
---
Can you remind me what’s good in Durotar? It’s the only one I can’t remember except for my memory in the OP
---
Please seek a mental health professional. You’re not okay. Beyond our internet argument, I’m legitimately concerned about you. 
---
I hope you can get over whatever it is you’re going through. 
---
(Longish post, apologies in advance)
---
&gt;Like doesn't everyone fall into 3 categories, Straight, LGBT, or None?
---
Not quite. There's significantly more, if somewhat complicated identities out there. Some relate to sex (That is, the physical characteristics of the individual, such as whether one is born with XX or XY chromosomes), others relate to gender (That is, what sex, if any, one personally identifies with). And others relate to sexual attraction (The sex of the individual they're attracted to). Some of these deal with the biological sex of the person. Some deal with which sex if any they identify with. Others deal with what they're sexually attracted to in others, if at all. One can, say, have a person born biologically a woman, identifies as a man, who is bisexual. Or someone can be born with both male and female reproductive organs, identify as female, and be asexual, et cetera. There's a lot of possible intersectional attributes that can be at play in a given person.
---
It's understandably confusing. So I don't fault you remotely for being confused by it. There's plenty of good resources online if you're ever curious on, say, what the difference between bisexuality and pansexuality. So really, the + in the acronym is just really to cover anything else that may, and probably has been left out. It really is just to say that whatever someone is, what they identify as, or what they're attracted to, that they will not be judged or otherwise looked upon differently. 
---
(At least in almost all cases it's accepted. There are such exceptions such as for adults who are, say, attracted to and engaging in relationships with minors or animals are falling into a very different category due to the inability of the other party to consent. Just wanted to put that out there in case anyone thinks that included people actively engaging in pedophilia/bestiality)
---
And of course, the movement is necessarily concerned with fighting for the rights of its members, which are certainly curtailed in most if not all states across the globe in some way, shape, or form. For instance, in America, simply being gay, which of all the LGBTQ+ identities, is probably the most widely socially accepted, only had the right to marriage nationally legalized four-to-five years ago. And being gay is still not considered a protected class in federal law. 
---
So the movement is concerned with actual laws, but it's also concerned with advocating for basic respect and kindness in basic human interactions. Even if the laws were all fine, one could, say, imagine a society in which there is intense animosity between different groups in it. Suppose a state with completely race blind laws, in which all groups are allowed to reach the very pinnacles of society, but in which there is still great racial animosity and hatred between groups. That would still be a bad outcome, and one in which people would probably want to work on healing the division, even if people from each racial or ethnic group were doing just fine.
---
Apologies again for the long post. The state of LGBTQ+ political thought is something that has changed quite rapidly within our own lifetimes (I'd be using a different acronym myself even but a few years ago), so it's understandably difficult to keep up with sometimes.
---
I think this is the best solution, but without keeping your old character.  Each character should only exist on one server (or expansion) at a time.
---
Druids can heal 5 mans easily. I would say better than Paladins who have trouble healing the entire group simultaneously.
---
If you’re worried about having a rez just group with a Priest, Paladin or Shaman. Those classes can tank and/or dps as well so no reason to restrict yourself to having no rez in group.
---
You guys in America are strange.
---
I can absolutely understand the desire to play in a safe environment, based on past experience.
---
But it can be dangerous to get used to playing the victim card while writing like that.
---
In germany we like to say something like "The sound defines the music".
---
Everytime i stumble over an american LGBTQ topic I find a guy who does a big disservice for his community.
---
Because the instant and first thing they do, is to label persons who have an opinion that differs slightly from their own or try to bring another view to a topic, as toxic, bigots and cis white males without hesitation.
---
When you disregard every opinion that isnt your own, label every person that doesnt belong to you group, using looks/race/gender as insult (really bad move!), loathing others comments or imply this weird newmerican word I so deeply hate: "mansplaining"... from an outsiders view you seem to be a toxic person.
---
It shows a lot, that you only answer people you can argue with and not the only person who respectfully asks something about your community out of interest.
---
This is almost always a negative side effect of isolationism and surrounding yourself only with like-minded people.
---
But I firmly belief, that the loudest people are most often the minority and do not represent a whole group. 
---
Therefore most people from whatever camp are pretty cool.
---
Peace and greetings from germany  
---
PS: Only 6 Months left!!!
---
That bird quest is the worst. There's like 2 spots with not enough bird spawns for a single person to complete the quest. And it certainly doesn't help that the quest is for both factions resulting in some pvp action. Which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.
---
What other hooks did vanilla WoW have?  
---
Gilneas  
---
Dalaran  
---
Caverns of Time  
---
Emerald Dream  
---
Timbermaw Hold  
---
Azshara Crater  
---
That door in BRD  
---
The various flightpath beautifiers
---
I'll post more if I think of them.
---
With classic I have the feeling that bigger the streamer, worse the content. Simply put they get surrounded by too many people and its literally not about the game anymore, but rather them swarming the streamer. I would probably look at smaller streamers that are high skilled, so that when they get people messing with them, they can most often beat them. I think all the streamers rolling on pve servers to avoid "griefing" are going to find out how much griefing your own faction can do. It will be interesting what kind of streamers will be "successful" in this, and I have a hunch that the kinds who are just doing instanced content, which is sad.
---
I never liked this sort of lists, there are easier/cheaper items to obtain that will do the job too.  I highly doubt the number of people that will farm bis pre-raid till the first raid. 
---
Talking about hunters - 1agi = 2ap (even more if ally and playing surv), weapon skills matters too (mostly for melee) but still gain hit chance for hunters. This weapon is better than the linked one  - https://classicdb.ch/?item=18738 and probably you don't need to waste gold on it. You need 8% hit chance, assuming there is anyone with the scope. But if playing surv the chance req is 5% with talent. Wrist enchant 7int vs 4mp5, 7 int is 105 mana, while 4m for 1m is 80mana, for ~5min fight it will be 400 mana. Minor speed increase over 7 agi? Nop.
---
&gt; anyone else that isn't LGBT doesn't have empathy is a dog shit argument
---
Literally never said this, of course straight people can have empathy and not make a big deal over someone's sexuality.
---
&gt; There is no correlation between being a decent human being and someone's sexual identity.
---
Inflammatory rewording but there literally is in this exact case. Logically LGBT people aren't going to flame you for being LGBT compared to straight people (haven't seen the studies where a significant portion of LGBT people are self-hating personally). This isn't to say that straight people can't be accepting, of course they can. Just statistically they're more likely NOT to be than LGBT people. If you combine this with like-minded people and common experience, it's almost like this could make a good guild.
---
Do you know what's even better for running away? Stunning someone with your war stomp and skedaddling outta there.
---
Come now. Certainly anyone who's spent anytime playing games or following game related forums hasn't heard words like 'gay' used derisively against something. That's not to speak ill of anyone, certainly there are people who say things like that, just because they're used to it, not intending to hurt or put off anyone, but it does happen. So I can understand anyone being potentially interested in making a guild to be able to deal with it a little less.
---
The first thing I look at when buying a monitor is its refresh rate. These days you either go with 144hz or 240hz depending on budget, then just go for the highest resolution that your budget allows for.
---
&lt; and their tanking is weak compared to other classes
---
You mean the other class? xD There are no raid tanks in vanilla except for warriors and druids. (I'm sorry for protpallies, but their niche is even smaler than that of druids.)
---
Some of these hypothetical splitting points are very interesting to me. For example, really early in WoW's development Undead were undead and Tauren had Plainsrunning. They were removed for balance reasons but what if they hadn't been? What if Blizzard had embraced effects like that?
---
&gt;As a minority who still gets murdered for who we are worldwide, I think we’ve earned the right. 
---
You said you earned the right to have a LGBT only WoW guild because you are a minority that gets murdered worldwide.
---
I hope you can get over whatever it is you're going through.
---
I have a husband and I can’t just bring it up normally in a conversation because *gasp* boys like boys?! Egregious! 
---
Don’t waste your breath, though. If someone hasn’t gotten it by now, they’re probably not capable of getting it. Or worse, they refuse. 
---
Thank you for trying though, dog bless. 
---
I hope you'll find (or create) such a of guild and I wish you and guildies have fun in Classic!
---
Thank you kindly! 🙏🏻 
---
You forgot prot pally. You won’t kill the rogue, but you’ll give him fits of rage as he runs away unable to kill you. Ive done this to a ton of rogues that were anywhere between 1 to 10 levels above me. 
---
We haven't decided raiding times yet. We might start at 20:00. (Although being a bit more flexible is certainly an advantage. And starting earlier is much more comfortable and is more likely.)
---
I would pick the opposite faction, only to farm that streamer.
---
Day three: LFM SFK exp plays only
---
I remember some warlock quest there. I had a very hard time, finding out how to climb one of that sticking things.
---
Dalrend is better than the 2h 1h axes. 26 agi = 52 AP + about 0.5% crit(remember hunters require like 55? agi for 1 crit). 
---
Dalrend is 1crit and 50 AP. 
---
Also Barbarous blade is prebis until patch 1.4 or 5 I can't remember, where we get the +15 agi enchant (but not the 25), which means having 2 enchants is better than 1 enchant so dalrend is prebis(well realistically BIS because you won't get MC weapons). 
---
When you went to the barons as a tiny squishy level 10, it seemed huge and scared the crap outta me.
---
My first memory of The barrens was dying on the road up to cross roads, to this day I have no idea what killed me
---
Track Humanoids only really works properly in some situations - otherwise you just get a bunch of noise on the minimap from humanoid mobs.
---
Like I said.. I'm not going to level alone like a tard.. also warriors are very very good end-game wise..
---
&gt;Logically LGBT people aren't going to flame you for being LGBT compared to straight people
---
There's nothing that supports this.  If I'm Jewish and I'm not a doctor or a lawyer then I'm not Jewish enough.  If I'm Mexican and I can't eat spicy picante sauce then I'm not Mexican enough.  There's always judgement within cultures and to act like LGBT is immune or isn't like any other group of people ever is silly... unless you've got something concrete.
---
&gt;Just statistically they're more likely NOT to be than LGBT people.
---
You can't use the word statistic and then not provide anything of scientific value.  The like minded people are gamers, as in we all play WoW and match up our goals into sub groups called guilds.  Being gay isn't a goal you can achieve in WoW.  Being bi doesn't make me a better or worse raid healer.  And certainly being trans doesn't make me less likely to offend someone who's non-bianary.  These things just don't match up.
---
The like mindedness stops at "if you keep doing something that was deemed inappropriate, you'll get kicked" which is universal to all guilds.  
---
If you want to waste hours on grinding low-drop quest items from hard-to-kill, slow-spawning mobs, that are being contested by both your own, and the enemy faction, yeah, it's pretty great.
---
Yeah i agree. Gearing 40 ppl is still no  joke, but when content like MC is borderline trivial with all the info we have now it certainly is easier. 
---
Guess we wont really know how the playbase as a whole will deal with the wealth of info. All i know is that back in the day Thottbot was a godsend, yet its lightyears worse than the resources the average player will be able to easily acquire today so idk.
---
Or we simply don't care that you have a husband and you can't wrap your head around the idea no one gives a shit.
---
Can't crit someone when you spend the entire BG in a frost nova.
---
*bigbrainplays.jpg*
---
Are those supposed to be conflicting statements? Naxx is the end of vanilla wow. Anything added after is tantamount to the post credit bonus scene of a movie.
---
Gamer grill with big boobs ?
---
Actually i do watch some vanilla streams, usually by guildies if im benched or guild pug runs im not doing. Or other guilds runs to see what they do differently. But as im interested mainly in the social and raiding aspect, raiding streams are pretty much the only ones i watch. Or to chat with a guildie thats grinding while im doing something else outside the game.
---
More so, he only focuses on the Nostalrius metagame 
---
Was'nt trying to dodge your question it is just that my point has very little to do with your point.
---
In my country we used to work for the lord who owned the land. We could'nt move without his permission. We could'nt quit or find job elswhere. We did'nt own our house or the land or the harvest. One could argue that was a corporation but not technically though.
---
Large factories in the soviet would be run by the state.
---
I don't agree that your health-care has gone wrong and it is not like your health-care is free from governtment regulation, did'nt Obama change it up quite alot?. Besides, nearly all global medical innovation orginates from the USA. 
---
It does make some sense to have the state take care of health insurrance. So i am not really against that, the devil is in the deatails. You need some hard data to prove that you actually pay more for your system. I go to jail if i opt out of paying for healthcare and we pay 40-60% of our income in tax + 25% VAT on all purchases and then there are regulations making some stuff cheaper or more expensive.
---
USA is also fatest in the world so maybe that is an important factor. You also have cheaper food, water and power. You have bigger cars and more AC. You have the newest tech like iphones and electric cars years ahead of my part of the world.  
---
Surprisingly good, thanks for the all the hard work.
---
I would really recheck the fury weapons though. Doing them is hard because whats your BiS kinda depends on your race. Based on my personal experience playing warrior on multiple private servers + dps warrior sheet results, I would go for these (excluding r14 weapons:
---
Preraid
---
Human: Ironfoe +felstriker
---
Rest: Dal Rend's Sacred Charge + felstriker
---
Phase 1:
---
Human: Ironfoe + Brutality blade
---
Orc: Deathbringer + Brutality blade/felstriker
---
Rest: Vis'kag + Brutality blade/felstriker
---
Deathbringer isn't that great weapon, it has no stats, the proc is bad and furys needing slow weapons in mostly outdated theorycrafting.
---
Phase 2:
---
Humans: Chromatic Tempered Sword + Maladath
---
Orc: Crul'Shorukh + Dooms Edge
---
Rest: Crul'Shorukh + Chromatic Tempered Sword/Brutality Blade
---
Crul on the other hand is absolute beast weapon. High dps, perfect speed and just straight up AP meaning less crit cap concerns.
---
Phase 3:
---
Human: Chromatic Tempered Sword + Maladath (AQ40 maces + ossirian mace come really close)
---
Orc: Crul'Shorukh + Blessed Qiraji war axe
---
Rest: Death's Sting + Blessed Qiraji Pugio.
---
Phase 4:
---
Gressil Dawn of Ruin + The hungering cold is BiS for all races.
---
Just my thoughts. Also, not related to fury, but manual crowd pummeler is best in slot all game for cat dps. Not even atiesh beats it and you really need to use them if you want to play cat dps.
---
Force a blink, goodbye mage. 
---
Not really, I only noticed that the last update we got about Classic was more than three months ago.
---
Can you share?
---
Upvoted so I can know after all these years.
---
Classic WoW did an interesting job of catering to both. You could enjoy the game a ton while being super casual and always have to for progression, but you could also go nuts at the bleeding edge and be very well rewarded for it.
---
I can't really compare to current retail version though. I haven't played in nearly a decade so I'm just hype commenting because I just found out classic is a thing recently.
---
If I play which I probably will, I imagine I will take my sweet ass time getting to 60 having fun them probably not even bother grinding out raids and all that
---
Hey now, 1k is great and all but don't talk shit about Loch Modan. The dwarvish people have built a beautiful vacation home paradise in Thelsamar. 
---
...I still use this mouse and it literally had just started breaking... I might just need to buy the new one.
---
Ditto lol. I've never known
---
For me, heroic dungeon break immersion, i dont want to come back to the same place 20 lvl later and feel that the sames mobs are still as strong while i should be stronger.
---
It also segment the playerbase, you can start farming end game dungeon even if you are not still capped, you get group of people that can still be a few level apart meanwhile you need to be capped to enter heroic dungeon.
---
As for arena, my problems were mainly the design decision around it. The class balance, resillience, and that it was the only way to get the best pvp gear.
---
2 genders 
---
 Literally first answer on that thread you meantioned.
---
&gt;Yup this. I actively twist in BWL gear on a pserver right now (as resto). On the plus side - it makes raiding more engaging and my melee love me. On the minus side, the big issue is the GCD.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You can get 2 chain heals and a downranked healing wave (or a couple R1s to keep Healing Way stacks up) off before you gotta swap totems again, so if you know then encounters well (and raid damage is predictable and manageable) you can twist with little negative impact to the raid. But when there is high raid damage, 3 pc T2 shaman spamming chain heals can carry the raid through a lot, so you won’t want to wasting those GCDs. On progression, I’ll usually twist during light damage phases, then when I know raid damage is coming, I’ll leave WF down to focus on raid heals. Also, twisting in tranq can come in handy in some fights to keep your groups threat low.
---
Very fitting not to even read your own sources  and  rather attack a country of origin of a poster (lolwhatwtf ???)
---
Please enjoy your 4 enhancement shamans setup in your own guild,  Because you won't see it elsewhere.
---
cause ptsd
---
I couldn't have said it better myself.  Thanks.
---
You know you can level in both zones right? :p
---
Also tauren can hit further than a gnome but be hit from further than a gnome. Can be interesting if you want to play a melee class.
---
These are the real questions. Intrested to know aswell.
---
I couldn't care less. Then again, I'm OCE so...
---
I've only been here an hour and I've been calling a nearly a dozen insults, some of which I had to Google.  Pretending there's no double standard is silly.
---
Teldrassil and Mulgore, hands down. I'm a sucker for great scenery and it helps that those two are my favourite races.
---
I'm with not to many people around.
---
or faster respawn and with faster respawn it could be better to grind with a group on a good spot 
---
Why are people with mental disorders forming guilds instead of seeking treatment?
---
Still using my 2014 naga. Aggressively
---
T1 warlock is gorgeous 
---
If you read the OP, I'm the only one in this situation
---
All gear is hunter gear. 
---
&gt;You stack dps stats, you try keep a new, very slow weapon, and make your Ret one button, macro rotation, and watch your Youtube vids while leveling.
---
Sorry but i think you spelled Porn wrong 
---
Wait till they are sitting down with low hp. If you pick your fights correctly you never ever lose.
---
Warrior : Ing+mining!
---
Please don't give false hope. But big of true.
---
True.  
---
Even though I'm also pretty firmly in the no changes camp, I am still open to the idea of content being added if it doesn't increase gear level or character level.  Another thing I wouldn't be against would be if they randomised the stat distribution on gear so we could go in not knowing what will be best in slot in the first few months until the data of itemisation is all compiled.
---
When I've thought about it in the past, this always seemed like the best solution they could choose if they wanted to introduce BC, you could either start at level 1 again, or copy a vanilla character over and carry on.
---
You can switch gear before the figting happen, you have stealth so if you want to fight you are the one who will start it when you want.
---
Also, a druid can run away from about anything so if the match up isnt looking good, you can just reset the fight, change gear and come back.
---
If they wanted to be treated so "normal", why don't they just focus on the game to begin with
---
??
---
but getting to dark shore will take ages. I mean how long takes it vs how much xp you can grind in that time
---
still have mx518
---
It's a perfect mouse but it's huge and heavy af
---
where is ret lul
---
That is true, but I like the zone because of the sunny atmosphere and it's so big and open.
---
It was pretty good and refreshing! Musing was well chosen!
---
People like this just assume we're going to be rude or give a shit about their sexual identity.  Then they don't understand how that's offensive or why they're treated differently.  OP is a self licking ice cream cone.
---
Nobody gives a shit who you like fucking.
---
You are forgetting what started all the MTX in WoW: Server Transfer, Guild Transfer, Race Change and so on.
---
Servers will die and people and Guilds will change servers. Some want R14 and will trans to small servers for that. They will have ways and in the end we all haver to pay the sub.
---
r/unexpectedtmbg
---
&gt; Making a point that LGBT folks are magically less offensive or that anyone else that isn't LGBT doesn't have empathy is a dog shit argument. There is no correlation between being a decent human being and someone's sexual identity.

Above is your comment.

Showing an (un)surprising lack of empathy and lack of being a decent human being there.

Oh woah, that's a real one. I had no idea

This is really good. The shaman and priest noticed their healer is being attacked by a pesky rogue and immediately went and peeled for you. Impressive.

You should play Paladin because you can clearly handle mindless repetitive tasks.
---
I played warlock casually in pvp and I did find it too slow and useless in a big fights
---
him and rogue are great 1v1 which almost never happens in a bg
---
As a druid, i liked to stalk some clothies that try to kill me, wait for them to sit for drink and ravage them with a painfull crit that almost one shot and finish the job in 3 seconds.
---
In the dumpster where it belongs
---
I always just assumed enemies could and avoided water.  Surprisingly, no one seems to know.  Lol
---
I want to play the game, not watch it.
---
If you can log out then sure but since you are directly hooked up the system might see it as "dying" and kill you lol.
---
Also, do they hear you jumping or getting out of the water?
---
OP has throwing out toxic bull shit for two hours.  Get the fuck off your high horse.
---
Your client does not know about stealthed players until they detected (data sent from serve)
---
Your client cannot display water ripples if it does not know what is causing ripples.
---
So, no.
---
This subreddit: "Classic wow is a social game!" "We need the social aspects back!"
---
Also this subreddit: "DON'T EVER TALK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S UNRELATED TO THE GAME REEEE"
---
I don't think it would be a big deal if a T4 rogue could one-shot me when a T3 rogue could already one/two-shot me. The only difference would be that world PVP would sometimes be as stressful at 60 as it is 1-59, something I can't see as being a game-breaking issue to those of us who play on PVP servers.
---
If it really is a problem, T4-6 gear could add raid-specific stats like resistances or even instance-specific buffs.
---
Your client does not know about stealthed players until they are detected (data sent from server)
---
So, I would say no.
---
Just a guess, but i believe such things are client side, which results: if you can't see them you won't get the ripples/sound
---
As you mentioned, Archaedas, the final boss of Uldaman, completely shatters players old and new to the game. And I absolutely adore that he does. The fight really feels akin to something you might see in a raid environment, and is a worthy encounter considering the lore stashed away in the vault he guards. 
---
Players from groups who disband after multiple attempts at the boss are given an incentive to return to Uldaman at a higher level for sweet revenge. And that's on top of the perplexing quests and chains within the dungeon that require multiple attempts to complete. 
---
Vanilla design at its best. Once classic exceeds all expectations and the original game runs through Naxx, I do hope the expansion of vanilla content is considered. 
---
Region? 
---
I am pretty sure they dont show. However, you could just dive below the surface when you move to be 100% sure!
---
if you just want to power level then it is better to solo it but if you want a lot of gold, items and with luck equip group is really good for endles grinding like Healer, Mage(for food) ,tank so you can always have 2 mobs on aggro and one can drink/eat.
---
The problem with Kara is that it's designed for 10 men. Atiesh is from a 40 man. Can you cram 40 players into existing Kara? I don't think so. So Kara could maybe be a 20 man or it'd have to be the new UBRS, which kinda doesn't make sense since it's linked to Atiesh which came from 40s.
---
Hyjal should be a guild level, full elite raid zone with world minibosses n shizz. Somewhere for guilds to go farm and PvP each other with nice rewards for the winners/owners.
---
Uldum? - who cares, I'd rather they did the Furlbog City in Azshara.
---
Grim Batol .. not sure but it should be a raid. Rogue red dragons or something. They're guarding...something
---
Totally agree with his idea that introducing these into Classic as they should've been will make up for the cancer that was Cata
---
Would like to see more 10 man fun raids like UBRS and maybe another 5 man or 2 linked to these. Maybe Kara could be like LBRS and UBRS.
---
I noticed that too. Bornakk seems to want to prove the point that just because Ythisen's been laid off, communication on the Classic forums won't just suddenly stop.
---
Now if they'd start to actually reveal some new information, that would be great.
---
Tell me why everyone wielding the power of representing the LGBT community is a toxic douche that spews out hate and personally attacks people.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Anyone else read the title and check which sub this was again to make sure lol
---
Damn you Booty Bay
---
Nope
---
You could have just said there are only men and women.  Just put a tldr next time.
---
&gt;It is because of this fact, that we cannot say which class is the best in PvP. 
---
i disagree, and put forth the soul link - specced orc warlock as evidence
---
Yeah, don't go bigger. I got a 24 inch 1080p and the pixelation of the letters and such is just a eyesore.
---
Hell, I even got a 4k 24inch monitor that doesnt have gsync to use sometimes because the PPI is soo much nicer.
---
No. You are undetectable while stealthed unless the char gets close enough to "see" you. As stated by someone else your client doesnt know a stealthy is there until told by blizzards servers so it doesnt know to create the effect for you to see. 
---
Pun intended :P
---
How have I personally attacked you?
---
For taurens the biggest problem may have been doors, for non-taurens the biggest problem was trying to click on the inn-keeper/mailbox that the tauren was standing in front of.
---
Was great for alliance PVP though, I've assaulted so many bases from inside the butt of mounted tauren.
---
No.
---
I agree with you that SL Warlocks are rather strong in PvP, but I doubt they are the best at everything. That is the point of this post - to ask about each type, not just *the* best class. 
---
Ripples are generated client side based on data sent by server, stealthed player data is not send =&gt; ripples not generated
---
What's funny is after verifying the sub I then immediately though it was about shoulder armour size haha.
---
For me bigger is always better 
---
Bears and Prots can tank, so can Shaman... and Warlocks.  It just depends on what you want tanked.  Making them all the same and removing what makes them unique is a step backwards.
---
When I quit WoW in 2010, hunters got team wide stealth, rogues could self heal, mages and shaman had a bloodlust/temporal w/e, every class was a dot class.  All this crap just kept adding up until everyone could do everything and I honestly just want niche classes again.
---
i can see the ripples  i create while i am stealthed . I've wondered this for years but never thought until now to ask. 
---
since you lack common sense ill try to explain it for you:
---
infinite growth doesnt exist, people will eventually stop playing, thus population will decrease
---
You just told me I didn't have empathy and I wasn't a decent human being like 15 minutes ago.  Are we just being kind when it's convenient?
---
Hell no, rogues are a noble apex predator who fulfil a vital role in maintaining a healthy server ecosystem. By preying on the weak these selfless rogues are actually helping the community by weeding out those who are unfit. The truly weak will eventually /wowquit in frustration so if it wasn't for rogues there'd be many more awful players running around, stealing your mobs, needing on your loot or dying in the fire.
---
The troll village in the south, really like the quest there.
---
AoE grinding /farming is just one option. And the Mage class is clearly the best for this type of farming.
---
However, there is also the chain-pull grinding /farming, which is almost as good as AoE farming. And the best class and spec for chain-pull grinding / farming is the protection Warrior, followed by Hunter.
---
Many times I was farming with my prot Warrior in same areas as some other Mage did, and every single time I was as good as the Mage in terms of speeding.
---
Sure, the Mage can pull X number of mobs and AoE them down in Y seconds while having to drink for Z time in between pulls. However, a prot Warrior (17/3/31) can easily chain-pull and kill twice the number the mage pulls mobs, kill them one by one (and lose about 75% HP in the process) before eating. 
---
I estimated that a prot Warrior (and not a T2/T3 geared one, but blues and T1/T2 mostly) can farm at about 85-90% of a Mage efficiency.
---
The Warrior advantage over the Mage is that the once his gear is mostly T2 and agi/crit blues, he becomes an unstoppable killing machine, being able to kill like 40 lvl 57-58 mobs before needing to eat / bandage. The Mage on the other hand doesn't have this luxury, because most mana efficient gear is also lacking hit, which affects every single spell, including AoE ones. 
---
But yes, for AoE farming, the Mage is the king. Followed by Warlock, at a very long distance.
---
I pointed out your hypocrisy. It's almost like ["trans people are mentally ill"](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/askrlv/a_guild_for_lgbtqi_peoples/egv8whn/) and being a decent human being with empathy are contradictory stances.
---
They're all viable for something. 
---
I don't like the idea of tweaking after being promised patch 1.12. 
---
I'm pretty confident if Classic does well, they'll introduce TBC servers. Those weaker spec'd classes will just have to hold off until then.
---
What would be amazing is if Blizzard released new raid content post-NAXX that contained new gear intended for ret pallies and so on. Very slim chance of that happening though.
---
In my whole time in WoW i needed or better opened a ticket just 2 times. The first one was in Vanilla because a quest in Dustwallow marsh did not work and the other time was in mop because one of my chars was in a endless loading screen loop.
---
I really do not know why so many people need them.
---
I doubt that, i mean its possible but if it really was there would be so many leaks :D
---
You know, I've seen girl gamer only guilds, tauren only guilds, paladin only guilds, old folks only guilds and probably many more in my time. Does it really matter? It's a social game not a job recruitment, people should be able to hang out in peace with whoever they want.
---
LGBT isn't my thing, and I don't find any reason to be offended by this because it's not something that affects me in the slightest. I would totally be down for a druid only guild though!
---
wat
---
Mage with a Priest is the ultimate AoE grindfest.
---
You know, I died a lot just by falling... a lot!
---
I loved questing at the raceing area... but the rest... I died a lot
---
Every zone looks big when you have to trod through it on nothing but your feet :D
---
&gt;Drop rates weren't that bad.
---
Collect 4 of those hoofs.... then tell me again the drop rates were not bad!
---
Pretty sure anyone who‘s not shit uses macros for targeting.

Its a shame what the did to it, reborn it with a cheap as shit sensor. 
---
Rip. 
---
I'm kinda torn between Paladin/priest/shaman
---
The content I'm looking to do is casual guild raiding and some fun in pvp mainly bg's I feel like priest is a solid choice. But is it too hard with ranking the spells knowing what to cast and when?
---
It's almost like I want a guild where people don't judge me and we judge you before you can join are contradictory stances.
---
Not hating since Ive owned one, but thats what you think until you try a new one from the shop. 
---
Simple loot courtesy is like:

A/ Hunters need on anything

B/ Press Need when it is an upgrade for you, otherwise greed

It's funny because goodwill is literally a thing in corporate accounting: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/goodwill/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/goodwill/)

It is literally on the balancesheet of every corporation, every quarter.
---
This is just going to alienate LGBT further from people because they're only going to play with eachother. No assimilation into the server's community.
---
...and when you reach 60 and meet organized pvp for the first time, you'll quickly realize that your victims turned into a pack of wolves, while you're still a kitty cat. 
---
 there's gonna be a lot of salty rogues. 
---
I have no issues with allies.
---
The only streams I ever watch are those that would make me a better player or those that demonstrate crazy levels of skill. This week I accidentally saw part of "Asmongold LOSES Mount Off for the FIRST TIME in 2019 - Almost Cries..", how the hell is this a thing?
---
same but if you're playing as horde you're gonna sick of barren/desert areas by then, at least it has some neat geometry though I guess 
---
This. 
---
Quite easy, you go to the camp. Pick up all the quests. Run to Gadgetzan. Empty your bags in the bank there for maximum space. Run back to the flats. And kill everything you see while running 1 full circle on the flats. Usually this takes about 1 hour (depending on the class) and you should have completed all the quests. This should usually get you about 1 level up, if rested a bit more. Deliver the quests pick up followups. Run to Gadgetzan, pick up stuff in the bank. and fly to Retchet for followup quests from goblins that send you to STV.
---
I used to record videos of myself jumping down from high places without dying, embarrassingly for my own enjoyment. Perhaps this **noflyinginclassic** is my calling in life?
---
[https://vimeo.com/70222021](https://vimeo.com/70222021)
---
Caster or Melee? Mage,Shaman,Hunter,Priest,Warrior, or Rogue?
---
I have changed my mind so many times. At one point I thought I was going to choose one of these classes multiple times.
---
What do you mean allies?  Is that code for I have no issues with non gay people?  The fact that you need to specify means you're the aggressor.
---
OP said "potentially allies" and "up for debate."  He's clearly undecided about is he wants any straight people near him, like that's not offensive.  OP also lashed out with personal attacks when I mentioned it would be considered offensive by some, so it's clearly not up for debate.  There was no debate, he's just toxic and offensive and deserves to be treated the same.
---
I imagine you'll get a feel for that as you approximate the needs of different kind of fights.
---
You could argue this about *any* other guild. The hardcore guilds alienate the hardcore players. But it doesn't matter at all, because it's a choice to join a guild.
---
Although an all-PUG server does seem like a fun concept, although I'm sure informal cliques would form.
---
Never liked the zone - too spread, too much time wasted in walking. Maybe only STM and Desolate are worse for me. The barrens and Ashenvale are in the same category.
---
Has this with the [G600](https://youtu.be/FZAvF2TCu-w) and, when I had a G500 for a week, it had the same issues yours do.
---
Also had a bit of frustration with people denying it. I suspect that there's some bias at play, or that people don't notice or consider the creaky and rattle stuff to be an issue. 
---
An LGBT guild is going to stand out far more than any other and get more attention from outsiders though. Hardcore guilds are *expected* to be a part of the game community.
---
Yeah warlocks were great 1v1, but it just didn't translate into BGs. Rogues at least had a lot of control so a lot of teams ran them as flag defence, but they weren't ideal.
---
Thank you kindly for the share. It would be good to see dungeon alternatives to BOE items such as Blaster Shot Launcher. 
---
Yeah my opinion resides squarely in the "nope" camp.
---
I'm of the opinion Classic should be a history peice, so, as it was/as close as possible. 
---
Why do you sound like a terrible supervisor after someone asked you a question about the job?
---
No need to be condescending.
---
Allies are people who are accepting of LGBT people.
---
[I tolerate all but the intolerant.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) I'm not OP you should take any gripes you have with them to them. But you decided to paint with a thick brush, so please tell me how much of a "toxic douche that spews out hate and personally attacks people" I am.
---
I making a guild for people who earns more then 100k € a year so who want to join ;)
---
From what little I've seen of them, there seem to be 2 sorts. The ones that make it all about the game are fine, the ones who rather make it all about themselves are not.
---
Not particularly interested in watching any of them myself either though. Although maybe that's partly because I played all the way through vanilla so it's not new to me. I just hope we get some advance warning what server these people plan to be on, so I can avoid them! :)
---
Yeah, that was great - loved all of Eastern Plaguelands anyway.
---
i feel like your list is overcomplicated.
---
ill reduce it down a bit to answer
---
Duel, Open World PvP, Casual BG, Premade BG
---
i didnt rate hybrids
---

---
From what little I've seen of them, there seem to be 2 sorts. The ones that make it all about the game are fine, the ones who rather make it all about themselves not so much.
---
I didn't say it was the same as classic, but dungeons and raids in retail are much more difficult than anything classic had to offer.
---
Stalvan questchain, and also the Marshall Windsor questchain (think its the longest one ever in game) were among the best.
---
Not at all. Every single expansion I played I easily found a guild to run premade dungeons, bgs and raids and players from other guilds/servers to play with. 
---
Actually fairly set on Rogue now, not 100% sure on race though. Leaning towards Dwarf because they're frankly quite cool. Not sure about how Horde have it though, is it significantly different or better in any way?
---
What professions would you guys recommend? I kinda wanna go engineering because dwarf and its awesome, but at the same time Alchemy Herb is tempting because it makes more money and you need herbs as reagents for your blinding powder and thistle tea. 
---
I don’t think it was too harsh, and maybe a couple of people learned something new today :)
---
why did you feel the need to comment with no other input than "you sound like a terrible supervisor"
---
no need to be an asshole
---
I did not intend to be condescending nor do I think my comment reads condescendingly
---
His response was not condescending in the slightest. Maybe your aptitude just isn't strong enough to handle adult discussions and you should stick to just playing video games. (This is an example of a condescending response)
---
He just explains how it works? Doesn't feel condescending at all.
---
by the time you reach lvl 60 you're released from the game so what does it matter
---
there's something even better... using this to revengegank them to hell and back.
---
I had a macro for these situations, two lines of true magic...
---
/target [rogue's name]
---
/cast shadow word: pain
---
bind it into your mouse wheel, get back to your corpse before the rogue does then spam it like your life depends on it, since it probably does.
---
when he respawns, the little kitten instantly gets dotted, denying him the change to sneak and actually do any harm. it's glorius how mad self-proclaimed apex predators can get after being getting buttraped by their "prey", over and over again. 
---
What's the solution? Don't ask don't tell? LGBT guild or not there are going to be toxic people.
---
I have a really hard time believing LGBT guild members would be less a part of the community than a hardcore guild member would be. The successful hardcore guilds do insane things very secluded from others, premades, ironfoe (and any rare drop) farming (for literally one person who needs it, the others just helping), controlling devilsaur, world boss kill groups.
---
how can you stop that which has never started? 
---
STOP MANSPLAINING. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I think that skill will come in time.  From what I’ve heard, it sounds like healing on a priest and shaman are the most fun when compared to a paladin.
---
Granted, healing is fun no matter what so you really can’t go wrong any way you swing it.
---
I’d say, look into the leveling aspect of each as well as the QoL/fun Kit each one has.  (Bubbles, ankh, and mind control)
---
If you can have fun grinding mobs for hours with your leveling spec and have fun healing, then you’ve made a perfect choice.
---
1. World PvP ( First when I am talking about wpvp I sort of assume non max gear, probably not max level players, other than raid vs raid Wpvp dies down quite a bit post 60)
---
- 1v1 WPvP 
---
You have 3 choices here for "best", Rogue can gank just about anybody if they are patient and wait for them to make a mistake all the while just sneaking away from unfavorable situations, Hunter can counter this to an extent with flare, and because they are so good at leveling they rarely need to drink/eat + they can also play hang out on a freezing trap and have access to the most OP 1v1 ability while leveling (bestial wrath), however they aren't able to escape as well as rogues, so they can't avoid 2v1s etc. Druid can escape from anything and also outlast just about anybody, and their DPS isn't anything to sneeze at while leveling. More defensive than rogues but not a bad choice if you want to avoid dying at all costs. E
---
- Duo WPvP (2vX)
---
This is a much more nuanced area, and I think you can look at the 2v2 TBC arenas to kind of get a feel for what would be powerful comps to an extent. Healer + warrior is always strong as is 2 DPS with high burst and CC that doesn't share DR (frost mage/rogue), (Spriest/rogue etc) BM deserves another mention here though because Bestial wrath is just that good leveling up and if you put a BW pet on something + anyt other dps they are probably gonna die if they aren't a pally, even if your CC is sort of iffy compared to some other classes the damage makes up for it.
---
- Group WPvP
---
Healers and warriors are the bread and butter of small scale group WPVP much like BG's warriors are just super scary if they have sombody to dispel them and if they don't have to worry about peeling for their healer because sombody else is taking care of it they are all the scarier.
---
- Gurubashi Arena (Mix of all above)
---
Really any class that is good 1v1 and excels at 1vx but this is sort of a tossup because the situation can be so wildly different every time. Rogue, Frost mage, Sl Lock, Bm Hunter are probably your best bets though
---
- Ganking Lowbies
---
Rogue or Hunter, rogues because you have no idea they are there until you are dehttps://www.reddit.com/user/Zumbert/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=classicwow&amp;utm_content=t5_3eb8aad, and hunter because its hard to get away from them if they have already started camping you.
---
2. Battlegrounds You can look up nearly any meta guide for wsg/AB/AV and get more information than I have time to type out.
---
Strongly depends on if your playing premades or not though because pub stomper specs don't translate well to premade oftentimes. AV is unique in that premade vs premade is a pve race and you pretty much ignore the other faction.
---
No ret pally?
---
Don't listen to him. Your comment was fine to an english native in both language and tone, perhaps he is a troll and baited us good.
---
Oh man, that was a riot.  I don’t think I’ll ever forget that.
---
This subreddit will have a thread listing where they go. 
---
After reading this thread i am so fucking happy that i live in Germany and can say things like "Spasti" "Hurensohn" "Schwuchtel" and my all time favorite "Fotzenknecht" but after thinking about it only "Schwuchtel" should be a problem for the LGBTQIHEHDFUAGHGHGBLKCLSNVNBN;E:WE community.
---
How can you determine that these are best in slot? Doesn't that depens on specc and playstyle. I mean how can we know that every possible stat has been combined with playstyle.
---
For example in wotlk, for a period of time people found out that armor penetration was crazy. Everyone gemmes only armor pen for damage.
---
Things like these might not yet be discovered in vanilla
---
Alterac Valley and finally raid as Ret ;)
---
Nothing will die off faster than a streamers server after the streamer leaves. 
---
As long as they have different servers and keep a version of classic that is purely what it was I would be fine with some changes.
---
He needs to update the tank BIS so that there is a full threat per second set and a pure tank set, T2 is never really going to be used by a main tank since threat is such a huge deal, fury bis should be really similar to prot theat per second bis.
---
In addition to this, the difficulty comes from the organisation and cohesion of your group as well as from mechanics. The mechanics aren't too difficulty (generally) however getting 40 humans in the same place doing the same thing and managing their various reasons for being there isn't easy.
---
Currently stuck trying to decide what to play purely based on wPvP (1v1/small group shenanigans at best ) ,no other factors included - Hunter,Rogue or Druid ? 
---
I'm absolutely on board with going hardcore with consumables/engineering so that's not an issue.  How long does it take to get a balance druid decked out for PvP (dem big crits) compared to the other two,who are pretty much set from the start? Was pretty much dead set on hunter until recently.
---
Yes, druid is the hardest class to kill in an open area
---
They laid out their thought process. A terrible supervisor would tell you no and get upset if you ask why. 
---
BFA tank changes didn't really make a big difference to threat, it basically went from it being literally impossible to lose aggro to now where as long as you actually have fingers to press abilities you'll be fine, maybe you'll lose aggro on a large trash pack if a DH pops off.
---
only threat per second set I looked at is the Stage 2 set since that is where my guild is at currently.
---
I would like to see new Tier sets as kind of off-spec sets. A Paladin tanking/DMG set, an enhancement set, a second elemental set, feral druid sets, etc. With set bonusses that help their specific sets. 
---
Go crazy with trinkets/weapons if you want tho. 
---
Ret paladins will be freely welcomed to the vast majority of guilds that aren't run by basement dwellers though, as they will be happy for the attendance (vanilla raiding is purely numbers based)
---
The only argument I could field for NE is the increased hitbox size of tauren
---
Best is pretty debateable m8, they're good good players though dont get me wrong
---
Tell me
---
Yeah this. I haven't given Blizzard a dime since WoD, and even then that was just for like 2 months. I didn't buy the last SC2 expansion because the game isn't that great, Diablo franchise is also dead as D3 wasn't close to being able to compete with D2. No WC4 even on the horizon, i got bored of overwatch within 40 minutes in the open beta, heartstone doesn't interest me and Retail WoW just looks terrible. Yeah i don't have any reason to give them my money really.
---
Since you've got gold fish memory.
---
&gt;You just told me I didn't have empathy and I wasn't a decent human being like 15 minutes ago.  Are we just being kind when it's convenient?
---
I "paint with a thick brush" because you're not condemning the behavior, which makes you an accessory and a supporter.  Don't talk down to me like it's not very clear you agree with OP.  I know you and OP love to play the innocence card.
---
Don't come at me speaking tolerance when this whole thread is about segregating people and making a LGBT only guild.  You wouldn't find a guild of neo-Nazi's offensive?  Or a guild that only accepts black people offensive?  Or a guild that refuses LGBT people offensive?  This thread is the same.
---
You put so much value on your sexuality identity that you make the mistake of thinking other value it as well.  Unfortunately, no one cares - which means you can't build an argument based on something that isn't true.  Half the comments on this thread are "no one cares about your gender/no one cares who you fuck" and that's how normal functioning people feel.  So we can stop pretending that LGBT only guilds aren't offensive and that OP is a rational person.  If you want to be grouped with him, that's your choice.  Don't cry to me when you get hit with crossfire after making stupid remarks about community outcry when people call OP out on his bullshit.
---
So first of, thanks a lot for putting the effort in and making a comprehensive list, that's long been needed!
---
I would make some criticism on the Priest (Holy) list tho:
---
Bracer enchant: +24 Healing &gt;&gt; +9 Spirit. also I feel that at least for Holy Priest, there are a lot more comparable alternatives, and it depends a lot on the length of the fight. e.g. shard of the scale is complete crap for short fights, and the ZG trinkets are better at Stage 2, with the Edge of Madness Trinket being viable until and including Stage 4. Also in T2 content I'd suggest either full T2, or more alternatives e.g. Gloves for "The Calling" quest with +51 Heal, ZG Belt + Trinket for the 2set Bonus of +22 Healing etc.
---
btw did you conciously exclude world boss dropps like Crystal Adorned Crown? what are your Stat weightings?
---
You are doing us all a great service, the more we punish them the less they dare attack us!
---
Best thing to do as a Rogue, you just Sap your enemy. Don't reveal yourself and just watch your pray being paranoid.
---
Hi,
---
ive played a wl on a pserver to 38 now, but im not sure if want to keep playing him. Ive played a hunter since tbc to bfa, then switched to dh. I really like the feeling of meele/physical attacks (no cast time attacks in case of hunter).
---
So i pretty much rollen everything out that is a spell caster. So im left with Warrior, Rouge and Hunter.
---
The most important thing for me is that i can defend myself in wpvp. At least put up a good fight before i die.   
---
I also like wrecking people in pvp, i want to play pve but i dont care if the rotation is boring or whatever.
---
The kinda Depressing thing is that each of those classes seems to be overplayed, so getting into incstances or raids can be difficult right ? espeacially pug 5 mans as rogue ?
---
Convince me to roll Rougue pls, ty =) 
---
why would you choose onyxia blood talisman when you can take onyxia tooth neclace for +hit and TPS?
---
I think it is safe to say that in vanilla this is a must even. A real MMORPG in all aspects :D
---
I think they should use this opportunity to make the last expansion for wow which draws a end to the current game. This way classic can start on a alternate timeline and new expansions can be made without making the same mistakes from the past.
---
Again, showing you're a hypocrite isn't a personal attack. You can change your views to be consistent. I would encourage it actually.
---
As previously stated I tolerate all but the intolerant. Those things aren't even close to equivalent to eachother.
---
&gt; So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?

[Your stance; unironically.](http://files.explosm.net/comics/Rob/hate.png?t=C95CE7)
---
2h fury have much lower Hit requirements
---
I think that's all in your head
---
I think its more the fact that sexuality is a protected characteristic, and so saying "my guild is for LGBTs only" is just as incorrect as saying "my guild is for whites/straights only". Hardcore raiding guilds are different to that. 
---
that partially right. you can theoretically make a BiS list for every single encounter/role, or you could instead talk about the stats and how good they are in which scenario, which would give you a stat weighting, which would allow you to value all pieces of gear according to your needs
---
My personal opinion, night elf druid.
---
Wisp form while dead is the strongest racial in the game for world PvP by a landslide.  It's completely underrated because people naturally don't like to "plan to fail" but you're going to die a lot.  Being able to get back at near mount speed, eat/drink (in stealth), buff, prowl and set up before the other person gets back to their body is insane.
---
Also Shadowmeld, fairly underrated also because it's hard to quantify how many times you didn't die to a rogue while eating/drinking out in the world.  Gank avoidance, can meld from spells being cast at you, allows fluid transition into prowl, an all around amazing tool.
---
Druid just for its unrivaled mobility and kiting potential.  You're always outdoors so no problems there.  You're a force multiplier if you aren't alone due to battle rez, innervate, and heals.  Your hot and dot, hit and run play style works very well in open areas and near pillars... you'll straight stomp mages.  If you're in trouble prowl/stealth in general is always the best way to avoid fights, pick your targets.
---
Someone else can chime in about gearing up, but I just wanted to highlight for a brief moment how much utility nelf druids really have.
---
Would jump to BC in a heart beat and I hope eventually Blizz expands to BC at least and possibly WotLK 
---
This is me
---
Of course the Battlemaster but this will be come much later because the PvP system is not active from release on
---
Or they will complain to the developer and get the “harasser” banned.
---
Because all gamers are equal but some gamers are more equal than others.
---
Oh, you're a "cis white male" because thats his favourite insult. It doesn't actually matter if you're white or not, straight or not. Thats his/(her?) favourite insult so hes going to call you it. Pretty sexist and racist, imo. Kinda like calling a chair gay because its uncomfortable...  
---
Its not the devil to me, but it instantly separates Classic from "real Classic" and you lose the game you once had.
---
Would it destroy the game if Prot Paladins had a Taunt? If Ele, Boomkin and Shadow Priest had better mana regen? If Ret, Feral and Enhancement were tweaked to have a chance competing in melee dps?
---
No. But it would cease to be the game that people remember. It becomes this Neu WoW, Classic 2k19. That is not exactly what people wanted.
---
It sucks that people who played those classes were forced into healing or rerolling, but now in 2019, you have no excuse to roll a Ret Paladin and then complain at 60 that you struggle to find a raid spot or even a group.
---
"Balance" is overrated. Retail WoW has all specs and classes be competitive, and yet that has been achieved only through insane homogenization that has rendered all the classes feeling the same
---
Well I would say they are probably the best with duel videos on youtube that are public knowledge. Not much footage from vanilla is around today and is lost to time, and with the inability to stream on twitch the people who would try to claim the #1 spot aren't willing to lose their revenue over it. Regardless they are easily top 1% and you would reasonable find either one shooting for gladiator titles in later expacs.
---
nah the other guy got it right
---
Good luck with this!
---
Someone from your faction coming to help. This is a community based game.
---
Only if they can see you already and the big swooooosh is way more noticeable than a splash or ripple.
---
The thing about class balance in classic is that if you fix let's say ele shamans problems in pve (which is mostly mana management and nature resistance) they become even more monstrous in pvp, how are you now going to stop a shaman that can one shot you and last for much longer?
---
This same principal applies to many other classes, boomkins and especially shadow priest are very limited by mana, if you make them capable of higher mana regen a shadow priest would steamroll because the main thing keeping them in check is that they run dry very quickly.
---
With prot pally and bear it's a way more  complicated issue, prot pallies have multiple issues that make them not ideal for raid tanking, giving them taunt wouldn't really fix anything as they would still run out of mana eventually and again if you buff their mana regen through a talent this could cause issues with holy paladins taking that talent.
---
Bear actually is much more viable than people believe but their main issue stems from a lack of defense gear, no big cooldowns like last stand or wall and they can't use consumes in bear form.
---
No one gives a fuck what nobody Enua on Reddit tolerates you twat.  Quoting MLK Jr. like you're insight is some gift to the world.
---
You just made this about you because you're self absorbed.  Way to not address a single point I made even after I explained it like you were 5 so maybe you could follow along.  Guess you're too busy Googleing MLK Jr. quotes instead of reading the toxic shit your gay community member is spewing.
---
Why does everyone forget Druids also prowl?  :(
---
Thanks! I think I'll stick with priest! I really like the playstyle. hopefully doing alot of group content to get pre raid bis will help learning spell rankings etc
---
Think that's a horde only quest. Don't remember those (was 12 years since I levelled a horde character last). I know the shimmering flat quests (which alliance also does) are awful, but not actually because of the drop rates themselves, just the amount of competition for each mob. Had kind of fun wPvP occasionally on a private server around that skeleton where three of the birds spawn. Was mostly a stand-off, with the faction with the most people scaring away the other, but sometimes some fighting broke out. 
---
I would pick horde or alliance and knock a choice off the board first.
---
Of course I'm not thinking about Shadow Weaving.  
---
It's unfortunate that you understand Holy Weaving and even PI-Weaving is the superior spec, but then go on to further defend sub-optimal DPS. However, it's not jus tsub-optimal, it's horrific DPS. 834 is not good at all. The issue why Shadow Priest isn't a valuable asset to any raid team is due to the fact that they eat up a DPS slot as well as raid progression gear. Where as that Holy Priest or PI Priest can do the exact same job, while saving the gear for another DPS, on top of a actual DPS that is far superior to said Shadow Priest takes that raid spot.  
---
In sense, they're selfish for raiding as Shadow Priest. This isn't retail.  
---
You can bend it anyway you want, but even shit guilds want to end raiding as soon as they start it. A Shadow Priest increases that duration. By all means though. Join us over at the TC Discord, a lot of these comparisons, tests, and actualities have been worked through. The author of the Shadow Priest sheet has even said that Shadow Priest is not good.
---
Commenting here so I can find this later :D

Good Trojan horse, I guess. ಠ_ಠ
---
The only points you made (wrongly) was that I personally attacked you, and conflating a neo-Nazi guild and an LGBT guild to be the same thing. I addressed both. Everything else was complete strawman and baseless assumptions. I told you to take your gripes with OP to them, and you didn't. Look up this thread, this entire conversation has been about me because you decided to say "everyone". 
---
We'll just play on some crappy NA server with a bad ping until the release OCE servers a year later and give us 1 free transfer so we either have to spend 100s of dollars or leave all our alts behind. 
---
Damn it, son. I suppose next you're going to tell me young men and women will be playing on the same server.
---
Ugh. If your mom asks, tell her I'm going to pick out a movie from the rental store. And don't even get me started on the **ethnic group**
---
Because it's hard to take cute murder kitties seriously, even when they're ripping out throats out.
---
I have to admit, I've missed having rogues around on the server I'm playing on.  They're pretty rare.  Not a single one has tried to gank me.
---
dungeon set 2 and zg were implenented as catchup mechanics.
---
You didn't address anything.  One guild that only accepts blacks and one guild that only accepts gays is the same fucking thing.  Sex is a protected category you moron, same as race and color.

join a casual guild, live with the pros and cons, be happy
---
but dont join a serious guild and expect people to play around your preferences
---
But raid progress is my main attraction and I enjoy hunting down BiS gear. The only thing I won't do is min/max my race. Dwarf warrior is far more appealing to me than human warrior. Different strokes for different folks. 
---
Make your own guild then, so you can invite the slackers
---
I already told you I have no problem with allies. Straight people can be allies. If you want somebody else's perspective get it from them, not me.
---
Remember that comment of yours about personal attacks? You're still the only one dishing them out. This is called [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection).
---
**Psychological projection**
---
Psychological projection is a defence mechanism in which the human ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude. It incorporates blame shifting.

I sucked during Vanilla times. I was a kid and didn't know what I was doing. I played Paladin though, never lost from a Rogue at equal level. It maybe long fights because Paladin DPS isn't great. But Rogue can't heal outside bandages and pots. So in the end there is only 1 winner.
---
Did you love Molten Core? Do you crave to take down Ragnaros once again?
---
Listen in as Josh speaks with three elite vanilla raiders, from back in the day and on the private server scene, as they discuss everything and anything Molten Core.
---
The guys touch on great loot commentary, obscure boss strats, and Thunderfury chat  and more during an extensive chat about this beloved vanilla World of Warcraft raid.
---
Josh then takes a great call all about mounts, and finishes up with the lore of Maraudon.
---
Highlights Below:
---
* Calling Countdown #1 – Molten Core With Ayle, North &amp; AK – 2:00
---
* Calling Countdown #2 – Mounts With Fahq – 1:27:15
---
* That’s Lore Like It – Maraudon – 1:59:10
---
most do nowadays but some do not you're right. FO4 didn't I know that much but most everything else I've come across is compatible
---
If you mean for your day-in, day-out tank set, you can pick up +hit on the ranged and ring slots if you're holding the DPS back.  For a full-blown TPS config, the neck is definitely better than the alternatives, although Eye of Hakkar is pretty good.  But you'll likely use OBT and Styleen's forever for your primary tanking set.  Those trinkets are too good not to have. What are you replacing OBT with before Sapphiron?  Serious question because I didn't do a ton of research on alternatives, I just took my OBT and was happy about it.
---
&gt; Bottom line, some gay, trans, and non-binary people feel better in a more insular, like-minded community were they can be themselves.
---
Same goes for straight people though.  In fact pretty much all people feel better around like minded people where they can be themselves.  Why do you even need to mention this?
---
I am a min/max-er but in vanilla, I just always play for fun - I don't level non stop, getting professions, chasing players, chasing player pets, screwing players, stealth near to Q mob and killing players, and more ruining other people gameplay. 
---
This is like the only real WoW version, where you can have a decent interaction between low-level players, without flying people, or heirlooms. On private servers I farmed dungeon2 for my hunter, + aq20 sets just to max my pet dmg, not like I did a lot of dps, but it was fun to me.
---
We also had to run through on the way to Gadgetzan.
---
People enjoy things in different ways and just because you personally don't like min/maxing doesn't mean it isn't inherently fun for someone else.
---
I feel classic wow gives me an excuse to play the game as i want, having fun with my shitty gear and not worrying about getting BiS and look up the best possible build for what i want, just take my time and have some solid good fun.
---
The extra b is for byobb. 
---
What protects us from bad rogues?
---
Don't be stupid, of course they'll have oceanic servers at launch.
---
You'll have to go trough 2000 fanboys until you get to him
---
 Yeah that's the 1, dal rend doesn't give any good stats for hunters, iirc dalrend gives str, +def and sword skill 
---
I really don't want anything added to classic and I sincerely doubt we'll get anything. The thing is, we got classic, but what about everyone that wants TBC or Lich King? 
---
It would only be fair to progress onwards to BC after classic, while still keeping classic realms live of course.
---
&gt; Well I know some content creators like Sodapoppin and tipsout are specifically rolling the opposite faction that their counter-content creator-parts are rolling to specifically make it fun
---
Well, I just found my server
---
I disagree with many of the hpala items. You overestimate spell crit at the cost of +healing which is by far the most important stat. Stage 4 only has 5 pieces of T3, you will want 6 pieces for the powerdul bonus. I will also argue that full T3 is the best all-round because of its high stamina.
---
DFT is the best choice for tanks afaik
---
we're currently at BWL and we don't have any Defensive tanks, they're all more or less TPS geared tanks (our MT goes Fury Defiance with DW axes for most tanking)
---
Good work - but just looking over the paladin list, which is my class I am spotting quite a few holes. This is very black and white and lacks 2nd and 3rd choices. 
---
Like, no way you will be able to get Azuresong Mageblade as a healer until your casters are decked out on this or better alternatives. Also missing items like Wild Growth Spaulders and the ZG heart trinket - But again, when do you use a mana trinket and when do you use a +heal trinket? Fights in vanilla are short - very short, and you got Mana pots + Dark runes on rotation every minute anyway. 
---
Oh yeah, i must've thought of the wrath version of the set where it doesnt give crit, but none the less you're not going to get dalrend as a hunter as rogues and warriors will take them or reserve them.
---
The same is with brutality blade and core hound tooth which op has put as bis in mc patch because those will also go to warriors and rogues. So hunters are better off getting the 2 axes, as the other classes arent interested in them and we need the cloak from last boss in the dung anyway. 
---
This is pre tbc patch correct? Because those heals are insane. 
---
Best thing I've read. Thanks, I love it. 
---
But that's not a corporation, so we're not talking about the same thing as you pointed out. Indeed, using this word so loosely is why everyone reacted so badly to what you wrote.
---
If it where true it would have leaked by now. He's trolling you.
---
the competitive mindset was present long before vanilla even launched
---
Basically you know the stealth sound you hear when you see a stealthed player? 
---
That sound was not intended, thats basically the sound your client make when it render the players model/equipment as "seen"..
---
Well in vanilla it was, they have just keept it till now...
---
But i think there is a bug, if you stealth and have a pet with you, i think the pet will be rendered by the other players client, or has this been fixed?
---
Just to clear things up, "Classic WoW" is a name for the game that's going to be released this summer. First iteration of WoW was simply called World of Warcraft, and people now call it vanilla WoW or WoW 1.12 (last big patch before TBC).
---
Classic will run on modern infrastructure and there will be some other changes compared to vanilla/1.12.
---
Subscribe
---
I'm min/maxing as hard as I can, because I dont like raids that much that I want to spend 3 evenings a week in them.
---
 Min/max, delete the raids in 1-2raid days, get epix, show what faction is boss with new gear out in the world.
---
For me PvE is a means for PvP.
---
Personally I want to go hardcore right at the beginning, have they feeling of pushing the boundary of a new frontier. Then a few months in you have options, one can keep going hardcore in the raiding etc or can then step off the freight train and go enjoy the roses with a decent cushion of gear and gold (assuming the world buffs stay as they are, I think everything prior to aq40 will get knocked over pretty easily).
---
If one leaves it too long before going in that direction you lose the opportunity to at all, or at least it takes twice as long to get into a raiding guild half as good.
---
why is everyone so obsessed with about beta or alpha? it's a already made game.. they have all data needed and testing on new client can be done in-house.
---
unless they state something or hinting something I would say it still comes during summer as confirmed not later then last week by CM 👍
---
Step your game up!
---
You're a negative Nancy. I can smell it through my phone. I'm gonna be wrecking basilisks in all greens
---
because dwarf is the best race :)
---
You can have so much with MC with a priest here :)
---
I've only been on for 4 months and I'm loving it, mainly for the people. I do one mythic + a week and maybe half of the current raid and that's it, rest of the time it's battlegrounds and not/mount runs with guild. But others do every dungeon mythic + at least once
---
You're right. LGBT people are just like everybody else in this sense. This is mentioned because for LGBT people in particular they face focused harassment, which for some increases that want of an accepting community.
---
For example, on LB there were a couple of transgirls in a guild. Colloquially the entire guild was called "M****** of *T-slurs*" or just "the *T-slurs*".
---
Isn't this part of the beauty of Classic though? &lt;Scrubs&gt; does the same raid content as &lt;Hardcore&gt;, it just takes &lt;Scrubs&gt; way longer to progress. But &lt;Scrubs&gt; are happy. They got it done their way, nice n slow and they had fun on the way. And in the end, they got the same rewards that &lt;Hardcore&gt; did, without having to feel like they're playing a dumbed-down version of the game.
---
Everyone's happy
---
I hate the fact that Blizzard does 0 in communication for Classic. How bad is that for a company? I work in the sales and inform alk the customers about what they can expect. Blizzard should be more transparant. And always that sh!t talk in earning calls and Blizzcons about that the customer is in the center blablabla. Sick of it. 
---
Blizzard should improve their skill in communication! 
---
Well, alliance only does the "mirage raceway" part, so they miss the top of the canyons view
---
I always loved levelling my rogue. I find melee quite fun as weapon upgrades are so noticeable (as opposed to casters). You get a nice dagger while leveling, or some strong swords? You instantly feel that big powerspike. I've leveled a rogue in vanilla and once on a private server, both as combat and as backstab daggers. I probably preferred the dagger playstyle but I think it's just straight up worse if your goal is speed/leveling throughput. I remember farming a mine in hillsbrad for ages on my UD rogue. Pretty much one shot some of the humanoid casters in there with ambush only being \~2/3 levels higher.
---
microsofts intellimouse is way better but sadly they fucked up the 2018 rework.
---
I especially love just trolling people by sapping them continuously
---
As far as I know, they did say the possibility exists, but not before a long time. They definitely did not close the door to a 1.13, but long after nax. 
---
Had the same exact problem. I started using the Logitech G600. Haven't had a problem with it. Have had it for 3 years. 
---
Yes this is true, the classic launch will be different to vanilla. However I personally find it hard to give any concrete suggests to how Blizzard should handle any potential problems. I think we just need to wait and see what happens, we both might be surprised by how long people stick around! I'm secretly hoping that it will be a massive success and push the retail game back towards it's roots.
---
For ur main I'd go eng. Alchemy is good enough to get on an alt, just like enchanting. By getting the alt to 35 you can already max alch and get most recipes. Along it it's either mining or herb. Herb is more beneficial later on due to consumables, but still it would be best to start min/eng and when maxed (both engineering and character level), drop mining and get herb.
---
For alliance vs horde... well orc passive is quite rogue unfriendly (makes it harder to stunlock, by pure rng with no cooldown), but stoneform(dwarf) and perception(human) are as well, the former making your crippling useless and if the opponent is a rogue making him able to vanish when affected by your bleeds and poisons (still you can use actives and consumables to stop it, though), the latter being only a nuisance if the prey is aware of ur presence.
---
So race-wise pick ur poison. Horde has it a bit better PvP wise being able to stunlock consistently but having pallies on ur side is a blessing. PvE-wise WF is the trump card. 
---
Mainly because it's a cancerous eyesore that's difficult to navigate and has stupid quests up those dumb pillars.
---
Why though. OSRS went a different direction while the two coexisted. 
---
Can't say about what was said on there as I'm out and using mobile data.
---
But for me why it will always have a place in my heart is because it being the first raid and walking into it and seeing the 2 big giants blocking the way you knew you was in something special and once you got to ragno and the music got faster and more intense you knew the shit got real.
---
This thread pops up every day... just play how you want to.  There will be like minded people.
---
*Wooo* It's your **7th Cakeday** yorishimo! ^(hug)
---
Bad rogues will creep up on an unassuming target, launch their ineffective attack and fail to score a kill. Without the kill, the rogue will not be able to feed on the emotions they need to survive, leaving them unmotivated and grumpy. Even worse, their intended victim might laugh at them and hurt their feelings. Weak and miserable, the rogue will either reroll or wowquit.
---
Rogue
---
It certainly catered to the casual crowd more than EQ. But there's also a reason top guilds left EQ and played WoW. Because it was better for the hardcore crowd too.
---
Classic and TBC hit a sweet spot. With WotLK they dumbed things down more and more and have done ever since.
---
It really sounds awesome. Why not just boost those specs so they can be at least useful and not totally unplayable. What could go wrong with that?
---
Well if you think about it more and more, it actually is a big deal. If those were stand alone specs and aspects of the game, sure. It would make the balance healthier and the experience enjoyable. The problem is that they are not. Wow is an ecosystem and everything reacts and chains to everything else. If you buffed few specs, it could have huge consequences on the balance aspect of the game, not just in PvP but also in PvE. You simply dont know how far could those issues go. Most of the specs that are not viable dont even have any real gear options for like the first half of vanilla and balancing them out would mean huge changes all over the place. And lets say you added more gear for enha shamans and feral druids - wouldnt that mean that rogues and hunters get even more powerful if they get those items on top of their itemization?
---
Those are just vague examples and we dont really know where those balance changes could get us, its just to get the idea. Its much of a safer bet if you let it stay just like it was. Because even if you tweaked few things, it could spiral out of control and and the experience wouldnt be the same. You could easily change things you didnt mean to change. 
---
So sure, blizzard could try to make a balance 1.13.1 patch, but it would be super risky for the vanilla experience. And vanilla experience is the biggest thing this community craves.
---
If TBC did become a thing, I doubt Blizzard would roll servers forward. They'd create new ones.
---
This is list is much better than OP's. At least in terms of usefulness. Pre-raiding and during early raids THIS item list is what you are going for a after all... all those blue items from the 5m enddungeons. 
---
You probably know the answer already, why are you even asking?
---
Agreed, there just aren't that many vanilla pvpers that put out content because of dmca's etc, once classic is out a lot of people are gonna come out of the woodworks. someone straight up saying "best" just irritates me tbh :p
---
I've yoinked dalrends on the 2 hunters i've played so far. prebis is prebis is the attittude at least on pservers.
---
Don't get MC weapons tho :(
---
Even if overplayed if you're good enough you'll get a spot. Specially as hunter since the difference between a good one and a bad one is brutal (and most belong to the latter group...). This is also right for either rogues or warriors since even being overplayed they have so many spots in a raid.
---
Another point is wPvP as warrior is poor unless you have backup. Even worse when leveling due to poor gear (and depending greatly on it). 
---
&gt; #&gt;
---
you used this wrong
---
Old blizzard had communication, when it was run by people with passion.
---
new blizzard more and more leaning towards Activision passion which is....? ;)
---
Some people enjoyed classic then moving on to wrath. 
---
But if they did that I doubt they would force it on people.  
---
As a night elf priest I'm in full agreement.  My star shards will rain down on my enemies!
---
The launch could be chaotic if Blizzard never tests the overload on their servers. The server cap adjustments, how many servers they need etc is all important
---
they have that data from retail imo :)
---
and vanilla.. to be honest should have some hops and bumps 😍
---
That's not how people who also want TBC think (I am one of those).  
---
The idea is: "Classic ha been really successful, in terms of returning subscribers, let's open **new** servers that, instead of stopping at Naxxramas, will progress into TBC."  
---
On top of this, the "dream" is that in time they will add more servers, with each cluster of servers locked in progression up to a specific expansion.  
---
Some people love Vanilla, some love TBC, some WotLK or Cata, some MoP or WoD, and some others Legion or BfA. Why can't everyone have their own slice of the cake?  
---
I personally love each and every incarnation of the game, for different reasons, and I would roll at least a couple characters on each of such servers, if they existed.  
---
Then, of course, Blizzard could offer limited time realm transfers for those who want to carry over their 60th level into TBC or, hear hear, they could even offer a paid character copy!
---
Just roll a good race and you'll be fine. It's the only thing you can't change afterwards.
---
Just find someone willing to follow you to a pond where you can test it for yourself ?
---
Stop saying allies like that's not some bull shit phrase to skirt around your clearly offensive agenda.  Just spell it out clearly that you only like straight people that drink your mental illness coolaid.
---
They didn't 15 years ago, why would they now?
---
And if they do it'll ruin the authentic vanilla feel. 
---
But they changed the infastructure to Legion's client. It's not gonna be the same as the 1.0 version.
---
Understandable
---
1k needles is very frustrating for a miner...You generally enter that zone working on tin nodes, yet you see just a couple of tin and a gazillion iron nodes just out of reach!
---
Don't forget that spell damage often comes with healing which will boost your mend pet. 
---
Yeah. This is exactly why I think I'll be going out of my way to join a bad/non serious guild-- progress may be slow but who cares I wanna enjoy every moment of it, plus these kind of players are almost always more enjoyable to be around.
---
&gt;why is everyone so obsessed with about beta or alpha? it's a already made game..
---
Woah woah woah. Did you **PLAY** the demo?
---
Yeah it was unfinished, which can explain a lot of the flaws, but there is so much to revert when you're going back from legion to vanilla.
---
They want to show us videos about textures when they don't even have basic combat close to where it needs to be, if there's no alpha or beta, even closed, it's a **BAD** sign for everyone.

It’s just a ride!

I'm not a min/max type of player but I still can't take NE Priests seriously.
---
Amen
---
This comment makes no sense.  You're assuming that him making ripples in the water isn't being sent to the server and to the opposing players client for what reason? Because the opposing player can't see him? That's not how these systems work.  It's purely just however blizzard decided to make it happen. Your comment is r/Iamverysmart material
---
this! ... it is completely fine to join casual guild and raid with meme specs. But joining progression guilds and demand others to carry your ass only cause you feel special enough to roll shit spec is garbo.
---
Gagetzan in tanaris right? Can you even enter that cage? Its been so long i cant remember.
---
I think what would be really cool is to use the new content from TBC but make it capped at 60. So you gain no new levels but you need to complete the zones in order to do the TBC raids. Think if it as one big long attunement. The quest rewards would basically be tier 1 gear so guilds running naxx would still have Bis items until the raids. Then the raids would start dropping the next tier level but wouldn’t be such a huge jump to make old raids still viable. Until you are in full tier 3 or 4 gear then the lower raids just naturally get phased out vs them being instantly useless. Also make sure the mobs in Outland give the same gold as the mobs in other level 60 zones and the same xp. Also quest gold would need to be on par with other level 60 quests. 
---
Basically my goal is to make all raids viable until you get enough gear from them and can’t do the new raids until you have done a few of the old ones and gotten gear to actually progress. Making raids useless is one of the biggest issues I have. Everyone should get to experience all that raids have to offer and not just the newest things. Plus I can assume everyone playing classic at that level will be of the hardcore so doing these things wouldn’t be out of the question. 
---
Play how you want, don't let other people dictate how you have fun, and also I wouldn't worry about trying to control how others have fun.
---
I think you'll be in the majority if you're on NA serversseeking to play the game as a fun hobby and not competitively, just remember that the moderates are far more likely to stay silent.
---
I'm not sure about this whole topic at all but what he said actually matches the things I read so far about stealth-mechanics back in vanilla. I understood it the same way he described it. Maybe private servers handle the stealth detection differently though... no clue here :O 
---
Talk to me in honor points! If my friends are playing they always pick the lowest pop faction, just to have more people for killing
---
I think the Arena was very good at turning many good PvP'ers into Arena addicts that after a while, only logged on to queue in it and it seems they sort of lost interest in the rest of the game. I also think the Arena a big part in WoW turning more and more into "interface PvP". They would almost not even bother to watch their characters anymore, just watch unitframes, debuff-frames, hotkeys to target ever ally and enemy etc.
---
When it comes to Heroic Dungeons, I think adding multiple difficulties to the same content is boring and takes away from the original experience. When you do Uldaman, you do Uldaman. Not Uldaman normal or heroic or anything else. It was a step in the direction of the horror we ended up with.. lfr, normal, heroic, mythic, challenge mode, god knows what..
---
&gt;playing as efficiently as possible is gonna get old real quick. 
---
Practically speaking, this is REALLY hard to do. There are so many consumes, buffs, gadgets and gizmos you can have that unless you're a fulltime wow player or insanely good at flipping on the AH, you'll never have to money to do half of it.
---
You don't see people constantly buffed with flasks in BGs- the rare game or two when facing the big bad rival premade, a few might be, but apart from that, they don't, why?
---
The amount of gold you actually need to play as *optimally* as possible is really fucking high. As a low ball I'd say 95% of players won't even come close.
---
Maybe missing the point on what you're trying to express, but for some people a lot of the fun they get from Vanilla is in pursuit of forever upping the ante on what actual MAXED gameplay is.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
what i heard is that they cut back on peripheral staff and stock up on actual developers so i dont think that situation specificly is something to worry about.
---
Unless you plan on pushing it hardcore, your race choice really won't matter.
---
If the demo is anything to go by and they won't hold alpha or beta then it will playable but very rough.
---
No, their itzy bitzy sharding clouds will shit themselves lol.
---
So this is why you wanted to know if there were any corporations before capitalism? 
---
My argument Subvertion of Free market Capitalism = More Mega Corporations. Your argument Capitalism = Mega Coporations. Your argument doesn't even adress my mine.
---
I didnt use the word Corporation loosely. It means a stock company and that is exactly what i meant when i used it. 
---
Some of the responses in this tread show that ppl think something along the lines Capitalism = Bad. Regulation = Good. Me having an unpopular opinion means i get down voted.
---
Not really, everyone will prefer a dwarf priest over other classes, just for the fear ward.
---
Good point, rogues are mostly douchebags but a good player will know what to do if one jumps them, provided it’s not an ambush crit 1-shot.
---
illegitimi non carborundum! This is great work, and I think for most of us who aren't complete dicks it's genuinely really appreciated. It's obviously gonna take time to polish it out - especially as nobody knows conclusively what items will be available/in what capacity at launch (yet)!   
---
A quick FYI: I've seen this for feral druids (beat/cat) [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z53H6Jfj6dmQiTUtBSq907A00XzlyRZ2G4tFzuRCzVY/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z53H6Jfj6dmQiTUtBSq907A00XzlyRZ2G4tFzuRCzVY/edit)  
---
which I think is about \~90% overlap with yours anyway...  
---
and this [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQ7W4mRlLVdNb9ryCEz1\_DP9xx9U0p1dqKJh-rCCEqs/edit#gid=1357566205](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQ7W4mRlLVdNb9ryCEz1_DP9xx9U0p1dqKJh-rCCEqs/edit#gid=1357566205)  
---
for warriors (dps)
---
Let me first state that I am all for no changes. However, this no changes is taken out of context by far too many. The idea of no changes stems from game design, particularly that of vanilla. With this is mind, blizzard really should be changing instance encounters, by that I mean boss mechanics. This would ideally done for ALL instances in the game, both dungeons and raids. Although this must adhere with no change to vanilla design philosophy. This coupled with new loot tables, would revamp classic, to the point where all the theorycrafting is void, without losing that vanilla experience we all want.
---
This idea could also be extended to profession patterns.
---
This would not only give us the gameplay that vanilla is known for but also inject mystery into the world, as if it were 2005 and guilds were figuring out how to take down bosses in MC.
---
Human priest is not the worst to choose. they have the spirit racial
---
Join an "Adulting" guild... Where they have set raid days, but  a pool of 60 people for a 40 man raid.  Life happens and you shouldn't schedule that around a video game.  Work calls you in? Message the guild rather than saying "Sorry, I've got plans" to your boss.
---
Yeah you might get left out because there's &gt;40 people, but it's better than telling your boss that your hobby is trumping your money.  They don't like that...
---
Night elf because star shards are really really cool.
---
Preference is preference and everyone is different. There will be plenty of room for everyone that wants to be anything from hardcore progression raiders to weekend RPers.
---
No, I've happily stayed far away from the WoW forums for the past decade.
---
agreed, raids are basically part of the 1~60 grind so that I can play the part of the game I enjoy (pvp).
---
Although that's true, as the rogue is snared and you have some distance it will force some cds, which is great early on in the fight.
---
Also although totem ticks every 5 secs not all rogues time the blind between that timer so most of the time it's less, even if poison totem is broken, so long as u get flame shock on the rogue + snare running it's af to reset even if you land the blind, not to mention you cant reset this early coz kidney shot is still on cd after being either resisted or trinketed a few seconds ago , either way the shaman will gain distance.
---
You're talking like a dps anchor determined to pull everyone down with you. Feel free to go afk mid-pull on your boomkin if you want but some people actually find it fun to optimise and push the game to its limits.
---
It is known.
---
Play however makes you happy. When I was in grade school with nothing better to do pushing progression through MC, BWL, grinding for gold to help out those was massively fun. To some it could easily have been a chore, but that’s what I enjoyed. 
---
Life and circumstances have changed significantly since 2004-2007 and I’m not sure exactly what I want out of Classic yet. 
---
Ha, an MMO isn't telling clients to create ripples on the water. 
---
If you lag, the ripples continue. Its client-side based on a characters movement while on an asset tagged as liquid. Servers don't set ragdoll information or folliage movements when clients walk through them either. Its a very easy assumption from anyone with a very rudimentary understanding of game networking. 
---
ATB is close enough imo.
---
"Reverse discrimination isn’t a thing"  
---
"Reverse racism isn't a thing"  
---
This is idiotic shit people spout to excuse the shitty things they do and say. It is the peak of hypocrisy.
---
Highly incentivized focus around the opening though you can't deny it.

EU forums, what are blue posts?
---
adding content after nax for lvl 60 will be the exact same thing. the gear will be better than nax and you have to continue running after the loot spiral.
---
no changes. content done after nax.
---
They prefer but they will still invite you to PUG dungeons. And if you aren't in a tryhard minmax hardcore raid and you aren't an ahole, you'll get invited to raids as well. Same goes for premades.
---
Firmly, no. I fully expect Summer 2019.
---
It's very unlikely that anybody will turn you down for playing the race that you prefer.
---
But if you PvP there will be times when you regret not picking the 'best' race because classic PvP is so rock-paper-scissor-y and certain racials help a ton in difficult matchups.
---
There will be a considerable amount of warlock players this time around when classic hits, after years of pserver exp with 1.12 people finally realized that warlocks are strong af.
---
Class representation will probably end up slightly different than it was back then imo.
---
Stumbling through Molten Core as my plucky gnome rogue and looking through Golemagg's window will always be a high point.
---
My guild told me I would see Ragnaros.
---
Spirit racial makes it ok to roll human imo.  There is so much synergy with priest talents.  Meditation, spiritual healing and spirit tap.  The rep gain bonus is really nice too.  Roll human!
---
Ha, joke's on you. I was weak, terrible at the game and pure trash during Vanilla times. But I was a Paladin. Enjoy that GY run you filthy peasant. 
---
I dont think you actually know what the term "Apex predator" means but ok.
---
And it can be so much cleaner if we have that alpha or beta.
---
This.   
---
Your guild also needs to be somewhat on the same part of this spectrum as you as well otherwise EVERYONE will be frustrated and unhappy. The people who want to take it easy will have a good time to the detriment of performance and efficiency will think that the "tryhard" players  are killjoys and on the other side the people who want to push performance and efficiency every week will feel that the "shitters" are dragging them down and squandering all of their hard work. It kind of boils down to have the same idea of what "fun is when it comes to raiding.  
---
Playing with a group of people that are within the same pretty narrow band on this spectrum as you makes raiding MUCH more enjoyable in the long run and so I recommend finding that fit.
---
Raids have nothing to do with the 1-60 grind. 🤦🏼‍♂️ 
---
Agreed they may be posting on the forums but little to no substance has been provided since blizzcon
---
hibernate doesnt work against ghostwolf
---
I understand this 100%. I watched a video of somebody playing goldshire, and the music, the vendors talking to you and the hit damage, even the text “you no take candle” brought back so many fond memories.
---
Part of me thinks I should try something new, but most of me is pulling me back to the Nostalgia of what I played back then.
---
also complete resto is only default spec if you have shitgear, 24/0/27 is the better raidspec.
---
why cant everyone have their own slice of the cake? because blizzard probably doesnt want to a) invest the work needed to remaster all expansions for the current engine and b) because splintering the playerbase too much just leaves you with dead servers which aren't any good.
---
I'm somewhat surprised you mentioned drink/eating a lot for druids, in general druids don't need to eat coz they can heal and they rarely need to drink simply due to how the 5 sec rule applies to them while in their forms, you simply need to front load the heals at the end of a fight and then just go back to cat/stealth by the time you finish killing you next mob your mana will be full again and you can heal back up, it's pretty insane sustain i'd say and is the reason druids are so good at leveling fast, not to mention you get innervate later on so even less need to stop and drink.
---
Unless you're misusing openers with spell spamming or not abusing the 5 sec rule you rarely need to stop.
---
I’m the same melee only. I’ve only heard bad things about feral in wpvp and are relegated to fc in bgs. Enhancement can be op if you have top tier gear, but I’ve heard that they aren’t good in bgs or wpvp until that point (this excludes resto/ele obv, if anyone wanted to say otherwise, I’m open to choice) 
---
Playing horde definitely. So that leaves rogue/warrior.... torn with orc warrior/ud rogue
---
Vanilla Gnome and avid explorer here, size does matter.
---
List of gnome only tricks from the top of my head:
---
\-Can go under several roots in big elven forest maps.
---
\-Can jump from Dwarf bunker windows in open world. (the AV ones have a different size that allows for all races to go through)
---
\-In Wasong Gulch, in front of what is in retal the horde graveyard, there is a wooden wagon. Gnomes can walk under it, making it a safe spot for casters as non gnome melee can't reach them. It also makes for a surprisingly good flag carring route, as the flag model is obscured by the cart.
---
\-Are the only race that fits through the windows in the bank at darnassus, so you can chill sorrounded by piles of gold with your gnomish friends.
---
\-Are the only race that fits through the chimmeys ground opening. This may seem a minor one, but it makes for an unreachable refuge against melee in many of the destroyed homes in plaguelands. Related to this, all races fit through the chimmenys ceiling opening, but only gnomes can exit it from the floor level without hearthing. In front in scholomance, there is such a chimmey that can be reached jumping from the slope to the entrance. Bak in the day, as a warlock that got there early waiting for the group, I made a sport of waiting in the border of that chimmey to bait the horde to  jump in, trying to reach me, and nuke them to death when they got trapped and I got out.
---
On the bad side of things, getting dismounted by a mere puddle was not funny. You also had a passive perma-taunt  for the enemy faction.
---
Good times.
---
Right. I'm not disagreeing that this is how WoW's system works. I know how WoW functions to make these things happen, but to say all systems are like this is largely simplified. 
---
The opposing persons client could still be told not to display ripple effects based off the opacity of the stealthed person which still exists on his screen. His client still knows he's there even if you cannot see him yourself. The games not displaying him and not displaying ripple effects because it's not being told to by whats happening within the engine. It doesn't have to be sent from the server specifically.

I can't wait for the Release
---
Some people really seem to have gone off the rails with this. A fucking wailing caverns video guide?
---
I kind of understand the optimization part, but the world first race finished 12 years ago. 
---
It's a very cool idea, as long as they put it on a new server and let you copy your character over. That way classic fans don't lose their OG servers.
---
You are not wrong. But keep it mind that most guild masters won't take you with your meme build
---
It is really not that difficult do not worry, just read a few tips and you will be fine. It REALLY is not rocket science.
---
No thanks 
---
And how are we who are progressing faster suppose to play?
---
I was in a HC raiding guild during Wotlk and the guild ”almost” died a few months after a new raid because we had nothing to do anymore. 
---
Your incentive seems to be gear, mine is having fun at hard encounters and when everything is done - thats it. 
---
I know that I and alot of others would jump in our chairs if TBC would be announced. Just make it possible to copy the char over and its goodie. 
---
People also min max pet breeds.
---
There is no 'best' at something because there's 9 classes and pretty much every class has a minimum of 2 matchups that it struggles in regardless of gear/consumables/spec.
---
Warrior is the exception. Assuming equal skill, gear, etc Warrior loses more 1v1 matchups than it wins.
---
&gt;had fun on the way
---
You can feel the "fun" flowing through your veins every time you wipe and waste time and gold on consumables because people can't learn 15 year old mechanics and your raid has to carry numerous special snowflakes. You think that it's fun and diverse, but it gets dull very quickly.
---
&gt;they got the same rewards 
---
&lt;Scrubs&gt; downed Rag after 1 month of progression and got their first loot and made a few people happy. By that time &lt;Hardcore&gt; already killed Rag 4 times and made half of the raid happy with it's loot. 
---
I remember watching alliance prems blowing devilsaur leather gold in their premade to have an edge. A 8,5k health warrior in PvP gear was a sight to behold. They only did it thought - as you mentioned - when the enemy prem was grinding and they wanted quick wins against it.
---
gnome warrior\*
---
I was doing wailing caverns on “another server” the other day (yes the SECOND dungeon on horde) and this dps warrior was giving everyone in the group shit all run. Priest wasn’t waiting 5 seconds before every cast for spirit bump and down ranking spells, tank was using taunt and tab targeting instead of using battle shout for rage, hunter was doing everything wrong. Literally on every pull he would start swearing and saying we all sucked. We never wiped once or even stuttered all dungeon but he wanted it to be known he was a mythic raider and none of us should play classic because we are all horrible.
---
Know what we did? Right before lord Pythas (final boss) we kicked him from the group then pulled. After we killed the boss he was private messaging all of us because he didn’t finish his quest and he was pissed. Through all his mythic raiding experience he didn’t know that if we tag a mob and even if he contributes, he doesn’t get loot outside of our party.
---
Karmas a bitch....have fun wasting another few hours in WC...
---
Min maxing in classic is what's fun to me though. I have it in retail because there is no end in sight. I'm playing druid because that's what I love not because it's good (they are one of the least picked classes in classic). But I sure as shit am gonna min max it. That said, you don't have to feel pressured to do that in classic. For pvp skill, premades, and pure hours played matter more than min maxing and as far as raiding goes the most important thing for the majority of guilds will simply be attendance and knowing the fights. You don't have to min max for the majority of wow to clear content and have fun, but it is something a lot of people like to do.
---
Is methodically facerolling Rag every week with BiS gear from guides and world buffs really more fun though?
---
Overcoming the challenge is, for many, the fun. 
---
Just fearward is a superior skill for the alliance.
---
Molten Core is the worst raid in classic lol. Anyone who actually 'loved' Molten Core has mad nostalgia goggles. Having to re-run that POS instance for your Tank's bindings and Domo / Rag loot when you're into BWL was always a chore rather than enjoyment. Speed running is the only thing that makes it bearable. 
---
Odd that there's almost no Horde - NA - PvE guilds advertising.  Anyhow, was looking around trying to determine if there might be a group of likeminded individuals advertising...
---
Undead mage all the way baby 
---
ive played horde several times and ive always enjoyed it :D
---
a lot of it has to do with my vision itself. im incredibly nearsighted to the point of sitting a reasonable distance from a computer being a challenge. herbalism in EPL, for example, drives me insane. looking for things in totally barren and plain areas is much easier. sungrass in azshara makes me want to hit my head on the wall...
---
ive joked many times about replacing the resources in game with a ragnaros model so that i can actually find them
---
I am assuming such thing as creating a ripple would not be sent to server because it would be really fucking stupid if it worked that way.
---
lolz you think im using consumables every pull
---
Of course they will. You can 30 man any raid to BWL with 'properly' specced and geared people. 
---
You know damn well what it means, unless you're just stupid, but surely that's not true.
---
Also, I would argue they are the best overall for pvp. They are the best 1v1 and world PvP class and still useful in battlegrounds. First in two out of three categories and good in the third? That's clearly the best.
---
And then my point in relevancy is that they are also good in pve. Other classes are bad at or useless in at least one category of play, whereas Rogues are always **relevant**. Sorry I used that word, I know it's hard for you to understand.
---
I'd much prefer an alpha or beta too.
---
I mean this just isn't correct at all really. The mentality of "Get shit done" has always been in the game. You're just a casual who has friends that take the game more seriously. Not using the word casual as in insult, it's just what you are.
---
I never said it was sent to the server. I said it doesn't need to be sent at all. 
---
May have even been around since the wow alpha.
---
Have I got a deal for you
---
Okay but the user you chastised said that the client doesn’t know the stealthed units position until it is detectable. That data isn’t provided to the client. This is a fact and I don’t think it needs to be proven each time it’s said here. From that fact it can be extrapolated that no ripples are created, no abilities which keep you in stealth can be heard, no emotes can be heard... until the stealthed unit can be seen in stealth or it is unstealthed. 
---
What do you mean? How do you imagine that would work?
---
stealth data is definitely sent.... the game knows players are there and stealthed the client is just choosing not to display them.
---
There was a 1h8m Naxx speed run on a big private server just posted yesterday, which afaik is the fastest to date. There was a night elf priest in the raid.
---
Every raid will want some of their priests to be dwarfs. Not absolutely every priest has to be a dwarf. What matters more in the end is how well you play your character as well as your personality.
---
Why do some people seem so bitter? I seriously think this video game is all some people have going in life 
---
It would be a very bad decision to send the position of stealthed players to other clients and tell these client to simply hide them ... that's the reason why there are so many "hacks" available in games like PUBG. What the others said makes total sense.
---
"Game knows hes there -&gt; games knows he's stealthed -&gt; game doesn't display ripple effects" never trust the client, boy. It's so easy to catch these packets with a 3rd party application and get the information you want.
---
UK 
---
The spirit racial doesn’t amount to much, the extra heal that humans and dwarves have does.
---
You mean gnome warlock
---
Livecoding of addons
---
I feel exactly how you feel. Makes it seem like a chore to always check on Guides, BiS-Lists, Tutorials etc., so that you (god forbid) do not even make one mistake or else you might give people the impression that you are rarted or a noob. I mean you can't blame people for providing help to the game, but it's the availability that makes the difference between the old days and now. Raid tactics and tips and tricks for every endboss? 5 second google search and there you go. So people expect you to know this stuff. 
---
Especially, when the game is as old as it is now. I play wow since the early bc days and I still have to admit, I can only play 2 classes well. And only 2 classes where I have some in depth knowledge about. Thats how complex the game is to me. I will have fun exploring, testing, progressing, because there is so much of the game that I still haven't seen. Hope you have fun too, guys. Sorry for mistakes. Wrote this very fast.
---
I doubt that, there is not single reason to send position etc. of player in stealth, both from performance and security perspective. You could make hacks to see players in stealth same way you can make wallhacks in cs for example, the other thing is server and players saves traffic, and some CPU cycles.
---
Enhancement shaman is fun if you can get half-decently geared.  Your main PvP grind will be for the Unstoppable Force in AV.  That 2h Mace alone was worth the grind and it's proc was the icing on the cake.  You'll be killed by any 3-minute mage unless you predict it coming and drop a grounding totem, but you have enough versatility to take on nearly any class and with skill/gear/trinkets you can overcome nearly anyone assuming you aren't super-low on health to begin with.
---
Play the game the way you want to, I’m gonna enjoy the game with some friends from high school and my SO and see where it takes me.
---
You can world PvP just fine in the combat riposte leveling spec.
---
So fucking frustrating that posts with factual information ALWAYS get downvoted in this subreddit, while idiots like thereIsNo-spoon gets upvoted for stating something that is objectively false.
---
Will you folks who hit downvote/upvote stop and use your brain sometimes?
---
Who says servers would be dead?  
---
Blizzard doesn't need to roll scores of servers for these legacy editions.  
---
They need to release higher capacity servers, and then have two PvP and two PvE servers for each region. At best add an RP-PvP and an RP-PvE server, if they find out there's a need.  
---
**IF** the population grows to the point of rolling additional servers, then they should do it, but rolling scores of servers from the beginning is wasted money.  
---
Dead servers have existed all the time, there are even now on retail, so it's nothing new.  
---
As per the development side, the bulk of the job is being done for Classic already, so they will not need to re-develop the full game for future expansions.  
---
if thats how wow's system works then its specific to wow and i stand corrected. but just because its an mmo and players are stealthed doesn't mean that this is how it functions. plenty of mmos deal with packets sent by stealth players in different ways and this causes issues with hacks to see stealthed players. i assume you're correct in how wow's system works because these hacks don't seem to be an issue.
---
Shadowmeld DOES break target. That's an absolute fact. And then he has the audacity to call it fake news as well.
---
Definitely not wrong about chance to glance, it was a thing. I took a moment to look for references to the old elitist jerks forums and found someone who also looked here

as someone who is waiting for vanilla to come so i can make another feral druid and live the uphill battle i whole-heartedly agree and hope this dogma catches on, lol
---
my first time :)
---
Some people will min/max some people will just go with the flow. Both are good. 
---
Exactly that. It was quite the journey.
---
Dwarf or NE hunter. Cant decide the race
---
I didn't use consumables 15 years ago, I'm not 6 months from now
---
In my experience they are about the same. I am going to level in a group when Classic comes, simply because being 3 people allow you to pull a lot more mobs, kill elites and deal with PvP in a much more consistent manner than going solo.
---
Overall I find the experience of group leveling more enjoyable than trying to take on Azeroth by myself.
---
You need Blessing of Sanctuary which is 20 points down and Holy Shield, the 30 point talent.  Redoubt can be picked up right away, but one will want improved ret aura from the ret tree which will take 17 talent points.
---
...
---
Yeah, most everyone here is aware how hard hunters begin to fall off in AQ and know it only gets worse in Naxx.  The average player most likely either won’t see those raids or won’t care enough to not roll one. 
---
ye, did play.
---
also realising it's almost 4 months ago and huge progress can be made during that time since they seem to be over the big obstacles.
---
Some stuff regarding combat, do you compare to pservers etc or vanilla? since some is actually wrong on private but people see it as the original way it's supposed to be.
---
Not remembering any particular stuff since I was most running around checking the environment. only example I know from the top of my head is the warlock summoning blizz explained themself.
---
sorry for crappy english, phone and on work 😅
---
Everyone probably figured there’d be too many rogues so they wanted to roll something safe, resulting in no one rolling rogue. 
---
the majority of competent devs will try to limit what the client knows to a 'need to know' basis. 
---
Like in CS-GO the client doesn't receive positional data until they are near enough to make noise, or would be visible. This limits wall hack potency.. although it clearly is useful to even the hearing range. 
---
Only incompetent devs will send the positional data for everyone on the entire server to every client. The reason a lot of games still do this is because they are designed to be ran p2p or on consoles so the client is assumed to be trusted. Every experienced PC developer creating a non-p2p game does not trust the client.
---
I aggree with you and I also like being the underdog. But when it comes to streamer servers, the disparity is unfair to the point you won't be able to play or gear up to fight back.
---
It won't be like 70%/30% faction, it'll be basically 90%/10%. You won't even be able to find 5 man groups to get some blues.
---
Min/max is what’s fun to me though. 
---
It was my first raid ever, i did play one other MMORPG before but that did not include raiding. Having 40 men at the entrance ready to go in and kill Bosses ... wow. 
---
I will never forget that.
---
Of course, MC is butt-ugly and especially with todays encounters boring, easy even. But that feeling will never go.
---
Hey there,

Nymis did a great write up on each Class’ strengths and weaknesses in World PvP over here:

---
That will pretty much end in BWL though.  Also as the clear times improve and the guild gears up, it will be very hard to overlook the performance of your meme-specs in the logs.  Unless you have a full raid group of people that are absolutely, 100% okay with slow progression and carrying meme-specs, then you will have people leaving the guild and moving on to greener pastures.  I know it seems like a shitty mindset, but its pretty hard to avoid in my opinion.
---
&gt;	i stand corrected
---
Yes, you do. Now please be thankful for all the people who took the time to repeatedly explain this to you, and please notice that you were rude to the first person by saying “this is /r/iamverysmart material”. It wasn’t at all. Feel free to post it to that subreddit if you don’t believe me.
---
that's 6 servers per expansion per region. you really think you can fill 6 servers with WoD in Oceania?
---
This guy clearly didn’t play Vanilla lol..
---
long before that. try a few hundred million years of evolution in social animals
---
From a purely semantic standpoint:  Classes that will give you the most "diversity" in playstyles would be Shaman, Warrior, or Priest.  
---
Get bored of going Fury Warrior? Try Arms for big one-shots or start tanking for a completely different experience.
---
Tired of playing healbot Shaman? Once you get enough ZG gear (or Tier 2 gear) elemental becomes perfectly viable for both PvE and PvP.  Don't like throwing spells? Play an enchancement shaman.  It's fun to windfury one-shot people in PvP.  You won't be breaking any charts in PvE but you can become a support/enchancement shaman that totem twists, wields Nightfall, and provides melee DPS with insane buffs.
---
Tired of spamming lesser heal as Priest?  Go shadow.  Once your warlocks in your guild have started to acquire better gear (raid gear) a single shadow priest with shadow weaving will improve their dps by a huge amount.  Shadow is also insanely fun in PvP.  Ganked in AV or AB?   Mind control your opponent off a cliff or underwater. :)
---
&gt;True, but ZG being a 20 man raid should have been an upgrade to dungeon blues at around MC level.
---
I dont see why really. People think ZG is easy because it's only 20man, but it does take more coordination to clear than MC, and it has mechanics that you need to deal with apropriately in a much larger capacity than any mechanic in Molten Core. Especially trash.
---
As long as they don't add LFD or heirlooms.
---
Best option really. Flo's and Jenna I would have to level anyways. Keep the servers separate I say
---
Hello Classic fans,
---
I'm stuck atm on a class to play. I leveled a rogue back in old vanilla, though never raided (I did later on in WotLK). I loved hiding in the shadows and the general playstyle, but I do remember it being a pain to level - probably because I didn't know what I was doing but that's neither here nor there... 
---
Recently on psevers I've leveled a Priest, Warrior and Shaman to around 30 each - I don't want to go too far to leave some mystery for release. There are bits I like about each; Priests can just keep going and going once you've got Spirit Tap 5/5; so rarely go oom and you can take mobs down fairly quickly, but you don't feel right in the middle of the action imo. Shaman was probs my least favourite, but I liked the utility of totems. And I really liked tanking in dungeons with a Warrior but out questing in the world they're a pain in ass too... 
---
Thinking about all this, it seems I want a class that has little to no downtime, good/quick questing, dungeon tanking. So Druid maybe?! I don't know much about them, apart from the obvious - can stealth (like a rogue), tank (like a warrior). What are they like with questing, wpvp, bgs, and raiding? What's there downtime like. And most importantly; are they fun? 
---
These are always so skewed. Everyone likes the idea of being a warrior, yet not a lot of people actually stick with the class. Every other comment in world chat is: LF1M Tank ______ 
---
Everything is situational and it depends on what you view as success in pvp, is it getting kills, never dying, or having the best k/d ratio. For me personally it's never dying, never being bested and sometimes that means running to recover before coming back in. Imo druid is the most versatile class and can do any pvp role successfully when you play to their strengths. They also need very little gear to do so. That being said, warriors with any cc removal at all and good gear are the undisputed gods of pvp.  Rogues and mages can be very dangerous but have glaring weaknesses even with a healer. I'm very excited to be playing a druid with my buddy on a warrior because together I think we'll be able to handle most situations.
---
Must fun I’ve ever had in WoW was climbing Ironforge to the secret airport with a bunch of guildies, and riding mechanohogs across giant mushroom caps in Zangarmarsh.
---
But what if I enjoy min-maxing? What if looking up BiS lists, sim'ing some gear and making spreadsheets is half of the fun for me? What if I was already doing it back during Vanilla/TBC with my fellow Elitist Jerks nerdy friends? Do you allow me to play the way I want to, just like I let you enjoy the game in your own way?
---
the pro move would be to have your hearth set to the prime ganking spot on the server (BRM, Silithus, EPL).  if you que up in stormwind or org it wont matter if your stone is CD because you can ghetto hearth
---
Amen to that.
---
I am expecting a lot of orcs and especially orc warlocks in Classic. Who do you think is the most efficient "orc warlocks" killer on the alliance side? I have always played horde, thinking about rolling alliance this time just for the purpose of killing all the people, who are rolling orcs just for the racial.
---
You only need a dwarf for bosses/mobs that fear which isn't really that common, and totally unnecessary if your warriors aren't retarded. 
---
You don't need to be a dwarf op
---
I always helped guild warriors with their axe quest and class quests when they got to them because I knew how hard they were but how awesome their rewards were...and it was fun to help them out.
---
I spent 3 days farming turtle hides in the simmering flats because I needed gold for my first mount and didn’t know how to play.
---
do you really try to argue with that? obviously private servers are not 100% right, but probably in the mid to high 90%s.
---
What we got with the demo wasn't even close. Especially client-sided stuff was way off in the demo and this is 100% accurate on Pservers, since people use the old client for that.
---
So for your question "do you compare to pservers etc or vanilla" - "he's comparing it to vanilla" is basically the answer, if we boil it down to the essence / important stuff.
---
&gt;  also realising it's almost 4 months ago and huge progress can be made during that time since they seem to be over the big obstacles.
---
yeah, it can be made. but since we don't know and have no indication of that, we shouldn't automatically assume that.
---
Part of that though is everyone wants to warrior and like 10% of them are even willing to tank lol. 
---
Let me guess, the OP wants to play a non viable spec and is upset he wont get into a good raid ?
---
You want your warrior friend to love you?  Windfury totem and heals will make him love you.  You also will be able to dungeon on demand as you’ll only need to find dps.  PvP gear is solid for Enhance memes too, but realistically you’re going to be pigeonholed into healing raids and dungeons.  Warrior/Shaman is just so perfect though. 
---
Rogue/Warrior is alright, mobs will melt, but there’s not a ton of synergy there.  Upside is both classes are in demand in all tiers if you’re good (read: you farm all of your consumables and are reliable).  On the flip side if you are just another rando rogue you’ll want to get in a guild ASAP to lock in a raid spot, as “decent” rogues are dime a dozen. 
---
Have you tried raid healing in Vanilla?  It’s the most engaging position imo.  DPS is really rather mindless, healing with how downranking and mana works can be pretty intense and fun.  A lot of room for skill to actually show. 
---
They were very clear during Blizzcon that they won't mess with the data because that could in-turn create new meta's and unbalances across the board.
---
it doesn't mean that this is all how systems work. just how wows does. wow does a lot of really fucky things with how the players exist within the world and how effects/triggers are activated.
---
That's funny considering that I started playing on day 1 of all of the fresh P servers when they came online and every time I got to Dustwallow there were mages aoe farming the guard towers and raptors and murlocs.  I wasn't speed leveling so I was in the main pack of levelers, so the mages were too...yet aoe going on as usual.  So not sure what you're talking about
---
Not everyone uses private servers so it's a pretty innocent question.
---
&lt;scrubs&gt; is destined to fail and break apart. the guys carrying the dead weight will get tired of it and gquit 
---
&lt;mediocre&gt; and &lt;hardcore&gt; will last
---
yeah this is new to csgo. when it first came out it didnt use to work like that.
---
How about you don't tell me how *I* should play the game? If you want to play casually then that's fine, but don't pretend like that's the "best" way to play the game. The best way to play the game is to have fun. If that involves doodling about throwing firework parties in SW or grinding WSG 15 hours a day then that's fine. 
---
perhaps I worded it poorly so you misunderstood me, what I am trying to say is like the guy I replied to raiding is a means to an end, to me raiding isn't "fun or the part of the game I enjoy, to me it is nothing more than an extended grind (like the 1~60 grind) so I lump them together as one long grind to get to get part of the game I enjoy (high end pvp)
---
I'll be shocked if that many people actually stick with druid. I think his poll will be slightly skewed in their favor because he plays one. That said I'm not discrediting that poll by any means it's probably one of the more accurate ones out there. It'll be interesting to see the actual numbers once people stick around and others quit.
---
Tbh i see most casuals doing it like 2 time and they stop trying. I think most people dont even want that learning curve. They want to get done easy and get goog loot out of it.
---
You are totally right. If you are new to vanilla or just havent played it for a long time, just go for it and have fun. Go slow. Do massive wpvp battles. Do professions. Do fishing. Do as many dungeons as possible. Enjoy your experience and dont pay attention to your played time. It is 100% always worth it, because the fun you will have is unrepeatable.
---
The problem is, once you have leveled up several characters to 60 and raided the whole content, this magic kind of fades away. You dont really enjoy having 20 days played to lvl 60. You dont enjoy not taking the efficient route. You suddenly find fun in optimization and doing stuff as efficient possible. You start having fun doing speedruns and pushing the limits. You enjoy min maxing. 
---
This game is so wonderful that both parties can have their fun in it. It really depends what kind of player you are. So please, do as you like and dont feel forced to either min max or doing things slow. Do it your way. However you like.
---
I love when 2 mages of the same faction are fighting over an aoe spot.  I saw these 2 going at it one time.  One would pull all of the mobs and start his aoe killing.  The other one would continuously sheep one of the mobs and low and behold the first mage would eventually run out of mana after all the aoe mobs are dead, but that one mob is still alive and full health from being sheeped and of course the first mage now can't fight and usually ends up dead with repair bill, then that mage does the same thing to the other guy once he revives lol...it's stupid.
---
Maybe even before WoW
---
Could someone finally make one with first division to horde and alliance so we could see a real distribution of paladins and shamans compares to their own faction?
---
"similar player to OP joins your m15 run". "Hey guys lets clear this instance :D" 
---
why are you dying on every pull?  after the first week or two you should be able to clear the whole raid with minimal consumes
---
have TBC and WOTLK added without the quality of life updates. Have those expos play like classic, would be different game
---
its a mindset destined to fail.  
---
As someone who just did this on a private server, Comcast was nice for d ok s but once I swapped sub for hemo and imp sap I never went back til raids. You can do either spec but sub felt better to me in both pve and pvp while leveling. Imp sap for dungeons is really nice (just bring vanishing powder for that 10% chance to remove stealth on use).
---
There are basically two possibilities how to progress to TBC without breaking economy, etc.
---
1. At the launch of TBC, let players decide, if they want to go for TBC or stay in vanilla, then transfer TBC characters with all their belongings to TBC, leave others on vanilla and do some server merging.
---
2. (probably easier) Progress whole servers to TBC and start a new vanilla.
---
The meta was different early on.
---
I'll give you an example.  
---
During the early stages of 1.1, BiS in MC for mages was NOT stack as much spell power as you could - despite as little of it was around at the time.  The reason why was mana.  For mages and I assume healers mana was a limiting factor.  What this means is you had to make sure you had enough +int first before you decided to go +spell power.
---
Also, BiS for rag included FR.  Why?  Mana.  People hit for so little that bosses took forever to die.  In the case of Rag, if your dps didn't have FR, your healers would OOM quicker.
---
BiS that currently exists is for 1.12 only.  And with 1.12 being "translated" and "massaged" into Classic, who knows how its going to turn out.
---
i hope you like being the annihilator or nightfall guy
---
that works for levels 1-59
---
Meh, racial abilities help you in one fight and then need a cooldown of few minutes. Most fights dont rely on racials, with exception of orc who’s passive racial is very useful.
---
Here's another reference to the math, but it's hard to find references to the rate* of glancing blows.
---
That being said, the math was VERY different than what you probably think it is due to private servers.
---
https://www.deadmen.co.uk/forum/archive/index.php/t-14901.html
---
I've leveled many rogues to 60 and I leveled all of them as pvp spec CB/Hemo lol.  I didn't find it long and boring.  8 days played usually for my rogue to get to 60 as sub.  And that's with pvp during leveling.  
---
There's a "before wow"?
---
Meaning, 1 - Accuracy on private servers is questionable.  They guessed.  They got laughed at by Blizzard when talking about how accurate they were.
---
2.  Blizzard has the 1.12 numbers, but it needs to be "translated" and "massaged" into retail.  They said as much.  
---
We honestly don't know what kind of game and experience from a damage/regen/numbers perspective we're going to get from them.
---
I feel like the demand for expansion servers pretty much dies after Wrath, maybe in a hypothetical scenario where Wrath servers have been open for 2 years or so the idea of MoP and Legion servers will gain a bit of traction, but I think that'd also depend a lot on the state of retail at that time. I see no chance of Cata, WoD or BfA ever happening, the people who want those servers are a very small minority, and will likely remain as such.
---
I also think an issue with post-TBC expansions is the "play the patch" philosophy they adopted, with Vanilla it's not really that big of a deal that 1.12.1 classes will be doing MC, Onyxia, etc, because those raids were still part of actual progression in that patch. 4.3.4 classes doing BWD, 5.4.8 classes doing MSV, 7.3.5 classes doing EN, those are not experiences that represent what progression actually was like when those raids were relevant, and neither were they designed with that in mind. Applying the same balance patches gradually like back then is not the solution either, as that brings with it a ton of other problems (prior knowledge, addressing balance issues that might not be relevant to how people play in 20XX).
---
Not that I'm against those types of servers mind you, I'd definitely play on TBC, MoP and Legion servers, and I'd probably even try out launch Cata too (and then jump ship once patches ruin it again), but I'm not sure there is a great way to do the later expansions, unlike with Vanilla and TBC (and to a lesser extend Wrath).
---
orc rogue, but ask me again next week and I will have changed my mind again

Last time I played through on a pserver, the vultures were literally killed on spawn at every spawn locations.  If you wanted to get the quest done you memorized where they all spawned and spammed your abilities at that location praying for a tag.  Hopefully it's not that bad for classic.
---
If the population is smaller than the servers can manage, you can always reduce the number of servers...
---
I absolutely hope they try to re-tread Vanilla, fill it up with some low-level dungeons, maybe a 10 man for 60s and a new raid, and Azshara Crater, and that would be enough to make me check it out. Personally, I think that should be a 10-years down the road thing, *after* BC and Wrath have had their day. And when they re-do Vanilla, maybe a re-done BC would be next. BC isn't perfect either, even if people want to play it. I just think we should progress through the first 3, and *then* get to dip our feet in a re-done Vanilla.
---
Also, I mean the gate near the Winterspring mountain range, in the northwest. I don't think there was ever a purpose for that gate, as opposed to the portal in the chasm.
---
Paladin leveling = Start fighting a mob....go make sandwich...come back with sandwich...loot mob that just died.  Start fighting next mob...eat sandwich while  watching TV...etc...
---
Imagine this, but with Cata's random Deathwing flyovers.
---
The horror.....
---
As someone else said.  Adding content post-Naxx is just the same as re-releasing TBC.  The difference that comes is that 1) It's brand new content.  That takes WAY MORE time/money investment than it does re-releasing an old expansion that's being re-mastered.  
---
2) It's not classic wow content.  They are attempting to change as little as possible from classic wow to give an authentic vanilla experience.  Vanilla experience did not include any "additional content" past Naxx.
---
3) You're only saying this because you haven't hit that ceiling.  A ceiling exists to prevent progression, but that doesn't mean a ceiling can't move.  Hell, I'd wager that IRL you're profession ceiling moves all the time (in terms of what it takes to get promoted, or get a raise, or to take on more job responsibility).  A ceiling being raised doesn't negate your past experiences, memories, or hurdles you've overcome.  In regards to Vanilla--&gt;TBC; the only thing a ceiling DIRECTLY affects is your gear...which isn't even a ceiling.  It's just progression.
---
It's possible, happens to several games in development. With no set date, this allows them to move the release date to suit their needs. I say don't expect it until it's live.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
I believe he means he raped the horde quest hubs.
---
The problem we have is that while we can play WoW classic, we can never re-discover that ignorance. We all know more or less what stats to take, or what builds to use. And if we don’t we have tools readily available to tell us. In vanilla we had Thottbot, but not much else. And Thottbot was pretty much just a database.
---
I’ll give you one advice, if you can’t even understand how other people can have fun by playing the game in a certain way, then don’t tell them how they should play the game to have fun.
---
Why would anyone listen to you if you even claim to not understand their mentality for starters?
---
That's the dream, man.
---
not the worst list. i just double checked priest and you only made 2 mistakes, green lens of healing and the 30+ healing wand.
---
nightfall enchance shammy for horde - you also get their totem buffs imo.   
---
There's a choice? I thought it was dwarf or bust. In all seriousness people usually want at least 2 dwarf priests but healers in general are a hot commodity and you won't be turned away by most guilds. I'd encourage you to consider dwarf but ultimately if that will make you unhappy it's not worth it :)
---
don't wake me
---
That’s an interesting idea.
---
username checks out
---
When work calls me in my free time i am not gonna answer that call. I am not the slave of my companie. So whats the argument?
---
Yes by level 32ish people will basically have to kill you 3 times before you die...then....soul stone bitch!! lol
---
Level 3 void walker sac bubble is like 1k damage absorb + fel domination you should have by then = double bubble, then your own health pool, then soulstone if they had help or too high level for you...rez after they leave and continue on your way.
---
This 100%.  There's no reason to go beyond WOTLK as a progression server.  WOTLK was their peak subscriber time.  It culminated the Arthas storyline, it was the expansion prior to the "reshaping of Azeroth" due to Cataclysm.  All-in-all.  WOTLK was the last pinnacle point of WoW.
---
Its never a crime to level, do dungeons or join bg's on whatever you want. Raid pugs will invite almost everyman because 40 is alot of spots to fill.
---
Less serious raiding guilds will need every member they can find.
---
If you want to raid seriously wich I guess only a small persentage will accually do. Than you are propebly recuired to play the best roll for your class.
---
Most "meme" specs like elemental are beast in pvp.
---
The before times. The long long ago.
---
For aq40 and Naxx, sadly you're right 
---
You will be lucky if you manage to take down Nefarian. AQ40 is pretty much out of the question.
---
Blizzard has set the precedent of releasing games on schedule no matter what. I can’t think of a single time they’ve delayed a game after giving at least a window of time when it will release. 
---
Look at all the unfinished wow expansions that released on time. You don’t need to be worried about it being delayed but you may want to worry about it being unfinished lol. 
---
I just hate the ultra-competitive mindset of current WoW, and the feeling that if I don't keep up, I'm going to miss out on experiences and gear. This is aggravated by the fact that every time a new content patch releases it completely negates the value of the previous raid tier and associated content. The game is too much focused on the gear grind and some dumb artificial mechanic the devs make up to keep you subscribed longer (like Artifact Power and the Azerite gear scarcity, for instance), yet the gear upgrades seem pointless and the mechanics are not engaging at all.
---
I can't wait to play Classic again. Yes, there will be ultra-hardcore groups and that's fine, but the general pace of the game is much more relaxed; you have quite the freedom to establish your own pace. Even if you are behind the curve it does not matter, because a gear upgrade is really an upgrade. Yes, there is power creep in Vanilla, but it seems way slower than current WoW. 
---
Personally, I just want to connect again to my character and a group of people while we venture in that awesome and dangerous world. Gear will be a consequence of that adventure and not its sole goal.
---
MY TIME INVESTMENT!!!! I NEED MORE PURPLE FOR HIGHER NUMBERS!!!!  
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It would be great fun for me to read what others would change and how would you do it. Theoretising on wow has always been one of the features of its universe that makes me feel excited
---
Not everyone does those things even on retail. I never checked a single BiS list or simulated any gear. Why would I? I'm not on a world top 100 guild, it isn't needed if you know basics and you know how to read. People just like to have something else to use as an excuse to why they can't down a boss.
---
Maybe don't tell people how to play their own game? There will always be minmaxing. You can't fight against people who want to play the game as efficiently as possible.
---
I wouldn't, other than the very occasional few minutes when I'm cooking and I can't find any YouTube videos that interest me
---
Cool.
---
That's not an option for some people, and that doesn't make them "slaves". 
---
This one says " The primary benefit of +skill is to reduce the severity, not frequency, of glancing blows (although it seems to do both). ". It seems to do both is hardly evidence to me. The sources that says it has a flat chance has done 1000's of swings to test it. I guess we will find out what is correct when classic is released :D
---
Eh we where nearly at Nef when TBC came out (newer server). If it becomes an issue I'd get some basic ones but seeing people with about 20 different consumabled... Fuck that its a game not a job.
---
What's there to express if you're #nochanges? I know for a fact that they won't even touch the data so there's really no point in discussing it every day.

Desolate is my juice for real. But I hate Silithus lol :)
---
Completely false. We used invul flask on huhuran to drop stacks on tanks but you absolutely don't need raidwide consumables to clear aq40 lol. 
---
1. requires changes from TBC +/- WoTLK
---
2. UnGoro will be quite "popular" zone, especially pre-raids. Azshara has a demon hunter for whom we have to collect poo... that's enough edgy content for that zone.. and you will visit it often for aqual quintescence

3. for the fun of it MC could rotate between frost/shadow/nature/fire just to annoy casters, tanks and alchemists ;) Are you happy with such solution?. You will be clearing  BWL or MC up to 50-100 times. The quicker the farm run the better. More modern raids just don't fit in there.
---
I'm not discussing it everyday. I'm interested in hearing why changing any of the things I pointed out would make the game worse. I just wanted to discuss it and felt like this sub is good place to do so
---
For me I want to play what I want and how I want but trying to be efficient within that, as well as having something that will make the end game more fun. I know I want to play alliance priest but my race doesn't really bother me so unless I have a reason to choose another race I might as well just play Dwarf to make end game grouping a bit easier.
---
Classic put more of a focus on gear and character progression while BFA puts more focus on fight mechanics and beating the next stage. The main difference, and why I like classic's approach more, is that one appeals to an RPG setting more while the other appeals to an action adventure game more. 
---
Play how you want. Find other people who want to play the same way (if playing with other people is what you want). Don't try to police how other people play. Unsubscribe when you're not enjoying it any more.
---
LS Testament! That was my first ever real guild, got recruited in 60 blues and raided from ZG thru AQ40 with you as our like 5th lock (second string).
---
I mained an Undead Priest in Vanilla.  I always regretted picking Undead and love the Troll race, so I'm going to main a Troll Priest.  I'll level a hybrid of holy/level spec.  Pretty stoked about it.
---
Every alliance raid will want s dwarf priest or two, but they're hardly going to shun other dedicated healers. All not picking dwarf means is you lose that instant easy in to some raids. You'll still definitely be more in demand than many other classes regardless of race.
---
And you keep challenging yourself my setting new goals ; higher dps, less death, faster clear.
---
If you don’t find that fun no problem, but gatekeeping what fun is is what makes this community worse. Too many people (on both sides) are being judgmental. 
---
I don't get people who want to minmax in classic. We've done all this before, there is no world first anymore, we know the raids and dungeons. Just go have fun. Play a class you didn't before.
---
I plan on playing what I want, a class I didn't play in vanilla. I plan on taking months to level up (not exactly because I want to, schedule). I've seen all the raids. Killed all the big bads. Got all the loot. I just want to re-experience the game and community, not to relive old memories but to make new ones as someone now-experienced in mmos and online games.
---
It's silly to grind hard to go kill ragnaros for the hundredth time. Or to get to naxx "first". Just have fun, it's all been done before.
---
Dude you keep digging this hole that you can't dig out of. You were cocky. You were wrong. You were put in your place. Move on... 
---
I'm not down for rebalancing things, but I am so here for more actual content. Stuff that got left on the cutting room floor because budgets and release schedules.
---
Minmaxing IS my fun.
---
That's a big part of what ruined tbc for me: having my hard earned gear instantly trivialised from some quest reward from killing boars or some shit.
---
Depends what your goal is. You are correct if your ambitions lie purely in raiding, but some people only aim to do MC and dungeons or even just getting to level sixty. If they had fun, they suceeded.
---
Im kinda new to the rogue. Sub is a dagger spec?
---
1. Why? Why would it be bad?
---
2. I would like to have more incentive to be in niche zones
---
3. I prefer harder, more requiring content over rushing things. The slower the progress the better, because it grants bigger fulfilment
---
And thanks for the reply!
---
wrong about what?
---
I like it, I'm amused by it, I've upvoted it, but... can we be honest with each other?
---
We've all accidentally started a run still equipping our fishing pole, right? Right guys?
---
Why not rebalance some specs mate? Seriously curious about cons
---
For a lot of people, min/maxing is the most fun part.
---
Have you seen "Lion opens car door?" I'd take the murder kitties more seriously... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaztQK9If0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaztQK9If0)

This is the rogue spec I run and it is awesome for leveling/ world PvP. As well as pick pocket farming sm. I normally rocked this spec all the way till 60 then swap over to full combat when I start reqlly hitting the dungeons. I generally rock swords for hemo/ghostly strikes otherwise you can go daggers and change some points around. But i am not a fan of daggers while leveling.
---
I was denied an invite to a guild because I was a Gnome. Sorry I like to pvp? I re-rolled horde a few hours later. 
---
I like this attitude.
---
It's one of the primary reasons people want a vanilla server; so they can have the classes as they were, without the fear of things getting changed up every patch cycle, beloved abilities being removed, etc.
---
Mc is plain boring stuff.
---
I am incredibly surprised Hunter is the least represented. Obvious this means nothing, but I wouldn't have guessed that in a million years.
---
&gt;Play what you are going to like, play the game for the enjoyment.
---
Yet you tell people how they are supposed to play lmao. "Don’t min/max all the fun away."
---
Find a new guild on retail that shares your interest in how to play the game?
---
Nobody is stopping you from playing retail or classic the way you want to.
---
Play the way you want but ffs stop telling people how they are supposed to play and how their decisions are "taking the fun away" or whatever
---
No need for cold snap without iceblock or icebarrier imo.
---
If you play alliance priest and dont play dwarf you're actually just a shit/ scumlord. Fear ward is the best ability that priests get in the game. As well as having a poison cleanse of stone form. Dwarf priests can self clense viper sting from hunters which is one of the biggest counters that they face in world PvP. And not taking advantage of the best priest racial in the game would just be wasted. So in short if you're not going to be a dwarf on ally then don't go priest.
---
Ok cool! At what level can you start pocketing at SM?
---
I get it, but I'm only about changing what wasn't used and one time only. If nobody used something than why to be mad about fixing it a little? I always wanted to play prot pala in vanilla and I couldn't do it. What's fun about tank "meta" consisting warrior only?
---
Btw, is it like the warrior, slow mh and fast OH?
---
So it's not like retail where you are forced to use weapons with a spec. But for leveling specifically and using hemo, I used harder hitting one hander for main hand (high end weapon damage matters). The offhand is nothing more than a stat stick for leveling imo. Backstab and ambushes can be done facing a Mon and strafing back and forth quickly but it's more trouble than it's worth and might not even be possible in classic. Those could only be done from behind/the side in older versions of wow.  
---
You're correct, this is the place to discuss classic. But what I'm saying is that these kind of posts are done multiple times a day. For example, posted just 4 hours ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asmmlk/tweaks\_here\_and\_there/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asmmlk/tweaks_here_and_there/)
---
I perfectly understand the point you are making. However i personally will still minmax classic. Here is why: because i think its fun. it might not be fun to you but its fun for me.
---
Generally i do thinks the opposite way. I minmax until im either raidlocked from progressing my character or im happy with what i have. I played a few pserver that way and i enjoy it very much.
---
Currently im playing on &lt;popular nondonor Wotlk 1xrate Server&gt; and i did exactly that. minmaxed until im happy where i am.
---
Now in just doing what i like to do (arena/dungeons with friends, pvp with my friends, helping new players with arenaquest/groupquests/iccrepfarm/fosposhor etc.).
---
I also dont share your feeling that minmaxing will ruin classic. The reason for that is simply because in classic both playstyles are VIABLE. You just have to surround youself with ppl that share your way of playing and you will have alot of fun.
---
THAT is why i think most ppl feel frustrated. They join a guild that is not "right" for them. Or none at all and pugging everything wich is, in my opinion, the worst thing you could ever do in wow, classic or retail.
---
Greetings, Harrk
---
Their client literally does not know you exist.
---
You only exist when you are detected by them. Actually there is a video explaining it.  Because the client has to load or reload the buffs and stuff on your character from the server, their client plays the infamous stealth sound effect when a stealth player gets too close. Normally, that sound is only played when stealth is initially cast, but because its the first time your client "sees" them and is told they are stealth, your client plays that sound.
---
Also why stealthed players in your group/raid aren't constantly making that sound. When grouped, your client knows where they are regardless of proximity to you. But if you removed the stealth player from hr party, they would begin making that stealthed sound when they got close.
---
Its an unintentional mechanic that is so good, they purposely kept it that way.
---
&lt;Mediocre&gt; and &lt;Hardcore&gt; will get to twin emps, the asshole raid leader will cause high tensions, and the entire guild will fall apart, likely with some real life death threats.
---
A sub-BiS list would just be the items you have acquired on the BiS list + whatever you happen to already be wearing. If you have 12/16 BiS you're going to smash content if you already know how to play.
---
You've never heard of the term "on call" before, have you?
---
Can you explain to me how a persons client doesn't know invisible people are there/around him, but instantly know when you pop something like spectral-sight / perception? Are you telling me the the users client has no idea that these people are him exist until there's an ability that sends commands to the server that interact with the invisible player, and then the server sends back the interaction to the client? it just seems to happen very fast. IE: seeing someone instantly or instantly novaing a rogue out of stealth etc.
---
Not really. There is a reason why the entire speedrunning community exists. For the same reason why people try to optimize level 4-2 in Super Mario Bros to save a frame-rule, people try to optimize leveling and dungeons in Vanilla WoW to get faster 1-60 times and faster raid clears. Trying to improve is fun.
---
Lmfao same..  watching YT videos to trynna help me decide but honestly.. I probably wont decide until the Im stressed with mates waiting for me during login
---
&gt;Every class has its place and its counters

Did you forget that warlocks are mushrooms? And what the hell can counter a mushroom?

 \+14 Int , use: restore 26 mana every 1 sec for 10 sec (15 min cooldown) Is that acceptable in classic for a druid tank to need that?
---
You're right I haven't seen other posts and didn't bother too look for them
---
My reason for that is I thought my own post has some detailed views I thought about for some time and put minimal more effort than just creating nearly blank thread opener with no detailed question
---
I didn't mean to spam or annoy anyone, but I felt that discussion about topics I've brought in other threads I've read in the past wasn't satisfying for me
---
You can still play prot paladin, you just have to compensate for it and have an understanding raid group.
---
I think Shaman's had Tranquil Air Totem in Vanilla. It's only 20% instead of 30% threat reduction and that will probably only be dropped if you get into a party with only spell casters and don't need the Nature Resist Totem.
---
It's likely just due to the shift in responsibilites. CMs can have a variety of particular roles to fill. Forum rep, social media strategy, video content etc... It's likely that Bornakk reabsorbed some of the responsibility Ythisens had. 
---
A 30% difference.
---
Ah, the classic "if you liked something I didn't, it's just nostalgia" argument. I fucking loved raiding MC back in the day. I still remember when we downed Majordomo and I got the Ancient Petrified Leaf, and when we downed Ragnaros for the first time and I got the Crown of Destruction. How about you just fuck off, and let people like what they like. 
---
Looking at MC objectively it has some cool moments but after a while it turns into any old cave but with lots and lots of fire, magma and dark walls.
---
The place was made in two weeks just about, and it shows. Pair that with easy bosses and bad loot (for the most part) and its easy to see how running MC every week for two years wore players down.
---
For someone that claims to know what the early meta was, you have a remarkable lack of understanding why that "meta" existed. You can't even call the early raid meta a meta -  because there wasn't the DM/ZG loot to supplement Strat/Scholo/LBRS/UBRS.
---
My guild was downing bosses in MC by Jan 05, we were in MC in greens and whatever blue dungeon pieces we could find and without a full raid of 60s for the initial ventures.
---
Your suggestion that bis lists for private servers might not apply in classic is absurd - the stats aren't going to be different.
---
How about this idea:  
---
Blizz decides to progress servers to TBC due to popular demand but realizes that some people want to stay in vanilla.  So they declare some servers as "permanent vanilla" servers and others as "progressive realms".. so for example servers: A, B, C, D, E, F, G are all progressive realms and servers H, I, and J are all vanilla only realms.  Then blizz offers one free transfer per character for A, B, and C to and from H for a limited time (one month maybe).  So it helps concentrate people who want to play vanilla only and spreads out the impact of the people who want to keep progressing on the progressive realms.  With all this going on, I believe they should be putting out 'fresh realms' for vanilla and someone of them being progressive and some of them being permanent but announced at their launch.
---
Fully agree, even if I personally found MoP to be the most fun at the time, anything Cata or beyond would be pointless really.
---
There is still solid casual guilds. I was in one on a private server, nost, and we would clear MC and BWL then Do Ony after in about 3 hours. We were required to get DM-N buffs, And the zg/ony raid buffs. but I didn’t mind. As a healer I get the free mana pots in the tribute chest :)
---
Aside from that, not everyone flasked up, or even used consumables. This was a loot counseled guild and people who put in the extra effort every week got rewarded. 
---
Some people wouldn’t call that casual I guess, felt pretty chill to me. Just a fun mature group of people that bullshit together in discord and also know when to shut up and take things seriously. 
---
Lol, you realize a lot of surgeons are on call, right? Also, what's a companie? 
---
100% when the Druid is tanking instances in order to get healing gear. Druids don’t have to only heal dungeons to get healing gear, especially when there’s a drought of tanks and he’s stepping up to tank. You should always clarify what the Druid is looking for in this case so you are not alarmed, but you shouldn’t be alarmed anyways when druids are usually pigeon holed into only healing anyways if they want to raid. 
---
You two have been playing private servers too much. Blizzard doesn't do 'fresh' expansions where they make you relevel.
---
Never have never will.
---
fear ward is only an 8 second cd right/
---
1. it would be playing level 60 capped TBC or WoTLK with their talent trees and missing gear printed out. It wouldn't be vanilla any more, but more like TBC or WoTLK. Also if like Paladin is true healer, true DPS and true tank then it starts to deprecate other classes that aren't full hybrids.
---
2. Many zones have resources that are usable at max level but it's rather impossible to make most of them that appealing to constantly visit. There always will be some gradation of early/mid/late zones.
---
3. Then play retail. Old games are so well know that they aren't a challenge. And you likely don't realize what it takes for a serious but casual guild to clear weekly farm raids even mid progression - MC, BWL, Ony + ZG and soon there after add AQ40 progression, AQ20 clears and so on. In retail there is one current raid, in vanilla most of them are constantly current and require 20 or 40 people even if half of them has no need to run it any more. Every weeks for months. Making farm clear last longer due to more modern and challenging design would discourate a lot of people and guilds quite quickly and promote more greedy and more hardcore behaviors.
---
I'm exactly the opposite. I'd love to play shaman but then I remember I cant tank? Back to warrior.
---
I get from Elwynn to Darnassus in my 1-10 route, it's a quick jaunt back up to Auberdine.
---
And at level 10/12 ish, the 20 minutes it takes to get there you'd lose out on 3,000xp, but I'd rather be in Darkshore with 50,000 more xp worth of shit to do.
---
Just decide before run who and how will roll on healing gear. It's not uncommon to have a priest or shaman as a DPS that also will be rolling on healing gear. Druid can heal, tank or DPS as healer doesn't have to be the rez-er of the group.
---
I want to create a progression guild on a PvP server.
---
Between the friends I’ve met IRL, through other games, on pservers, and the people I’ll meet upon release I’m truly excited to get involved in a new community.
---
Loving the podcast so far and I had to share my wtf moment listening to one of the earlier episodes. You were interviewing the former dev, Alex I think it was and he mentioned he was in Mediocrity...which was also my guild! I had no idea there was a dev in my guild!
---
I hope so. Won’t be able to play till the fall. 
---
Remember that &lt;Scrubs&gt; doesn't use consumables and uses Ret Paladins and Boomkins. So they probably take 6 months to down Rag.
---
I don't know why but I read that as "slav" at first. Of course, the slav pose would make a HUGE difference on the warlock.
---
I guess it depends on how much you like desert/wasteland settings. I love them, so it's a highlight for me. Plus vanilla Echo Isles could be pretty challenging.
---
The thing with Classic is, if you want loot, you have to stick around
---
Fuck those guys 
---
The highest I made it to a private server was level 32. I played it for a month. I just know playing classic I don't want my character to move to a TBC realm if I don't want it to. What's so wrong with the leveling process and burning crusade? Everyone gets an even start.
---
&gt;or even just getting to level sixty
---
This will be me. I will go for visiting each normal  dungeon once just for nostalgia, leveling slowly to 60 by doing every quest in the game. Getting my professions up and grinding a bit for that and then I will be done. I find the endgame stressful and not the least fun and I never found it fun. 
---
I might not play something utterly stupid like a melee hunter but that's it. 
---
You know... Sometimes i think this sub forgets that pve servers exist. 
---
Because it’s so damn peaceful (not including shimmers) that we don’t want to let alliance know how many of us horde quest here. 
---
[Me seeing 1k needles in cata for the first time](https://i.imgur.com/zzFQ17j.gif)
---
People know hunters are somewhat lackluster in endgame I guess. 
---
Everyone votes war for 3 viable specs but half will quit by level 30 because of war levelling.
---
Dwarves are alliance
---
Dwarf ladies are the best! Now I miss my first char and her huge white bear.
---
I'm sorry but this mentality is only coming from players that progressed to only low to mid tier raids in Vanilla. You feel this way because vanilla still had unfinished content for you, and you wanted to be able to get there 'eventually'. But it's not about 1 person, it's about the average person.
---
Progression based MMOs are not predicated on the low to mid tier players progression pace, nor the super elite that had killed KT a few times, but the average-ish level player that probably had done almost all of AQ40, several bosses in Naxx, all of BWL, all of MC, etc.
---
If the highest raid you achieved was MC or BWL when TBC was announced (November 9th, 2006) BWL had been out for almost 1.5 years, Molten Core since the launch of vanilla. Average players that had been playing since launch had done most of AQ, maybe a few bosses in Naxx. What do you say to those players? Fuck em because they started playing the game before me?
---
The average player needed a next thing to progress to, it's what MMOs are entirely based around. We see this phenomenon in private servers all the time because they don't have the ability to smoothly transition from one expansion to another due to the cores of each game not being the same since they were developed by different people at different times.
---
Once players reach the end of the raiding or pvp scene in an expansion they slowly start to quit due to nothing to look forward to. No one wants to kill KT for 4 years when they have all the gear already, they want something to move on to.
---
The most likely scenario is Blizzard is going to release TBC in a reasonable time frame because if they don't people aren't going to play Vanilla for 20 years. No one players a single vanilla server forever, they move on to the new 'fresh' realm to start over again because that's all there is to do in the private emulation scene. With Blizzard running the show there will finally be able to be a proper next step through TBC and WOTLK eventually which are the Classic Trilogy of original WoW. 
---
Prolly the most coveted vanilla mount for alliance chars
---
You just agreed with me.  Mc is not the end of the game.  It's just a very easy raid where most of the loot is trash.
---
So any guild who breaks up during the mc phase has failed.
---
It depends, I have a general rule, but there’s exceptions:
---
I let them 1v1. If the horde wins, I’ll clap and res my teammate. If the alliance wins, they get a buff, heal, innervate, and a cheer!
---
If the alliance member is going to clearly win, I might throw out a moonfire because hey, free honor and honor is gear.
---
If they are an undead or orc rogue, they will always be attacked, as well as orc hunters, they tend to be gankers as well.
---
I also tend to leave other druids alone.
---
It's the fastest to date because the tuning is probably inaccurate as heck lol. I will tip my hat when they do the same run on official Classic.
---
In the past 2 weeks a community manager confirmed it’ll be in the summer. No delays. 
---
Exactly.  Which takes a long ass time.  And BiS really doesn’t matter until 60
---
Ok so we're already at vanilla vs retail point. I agree on progression part and I'm happy that in vanilla raids didn't make other raids obsolete. I just think that mechanisms fucking sucked dick and implementing even some basic things people should learn how to play around would be overall good. The more I think about it the more vanilla raiding feels like it was made for imbecils that later failed on first serious encounter anywhere. It was so painful in early TBC to just explain anything to anybody. But it won't be the case now so maybe you're right, vanilla was more crafted towards resources and time management than mechanics. I just think it easly could suit both needs by simple tweaks. Maybe vanilla raiding isn't for casuals that are into harder challenges like me but for people that just wanna go and spend a lot of time in different raid instances and have fun and that's fine tbh
---
There's a small entrance on the side facing the horde FP as I recall. 
---
Troll or orc rogue baby.
---
&lt;hardcore&gt; will easily defeat twin emps
---
&lt;Mediocre&gt; will spend more time on it but should be able to handle it easily once the raid learns the fight.  They will be trying to raid like &lt;hardcore&gt; so they will be successful after the learning curve.
---
&lt;Scrubs&gt; broke up a year before aq opened but it was a bunch of meme spec scrubs being carried by a handful of people who eventually join &lt;mediocre&gt; or &lt;hardcore&gt;
---
Or you know, play the game the way that makes you happy. 
---
Oh wow. How comes so many people wanna roll druid and so little go for rogue
---
&gt;I want to spend at least 2-5 years there
---
What do you say to the players that clear content in a timely manner and don't need 5 years to complete the game?
---
It's not about you, or me, its about the average player.
---
This sounds like the most PitA combo you could face in the open world.
---
Massive burst on both, pressure from the lock, constant pet/totem damage, good cc, slows, off healing, purge, and 2 self resurrects.
---
Can’t really run because of the shaman and frost shock, but hey, at least you’ll see them coming.
---
And then 1 out of 5 chance to get it. Losing your mind so easily
---
Not entirely a must.  But it's a huge game changer.
---
The barrens is the most ideal leveling zone. It’s one zone that has quests ranging from level 10-24. It is also next to not one not two but three zones that you will level in while doing the upper level barrens quests. Once you know how the barrens quests work, you can do like 6+ quests at once multiple times and become EXTREMELY efficient. Especially when you use your hearth correctly. It’s way better than alliance having to jump zone to zone to supplement westfall or loch Modan. 
---
That’s kinda funny. I just came back in 8.1 and I’m loving running mindless mythics now. IE are basically excuses to blow some super fat aoe dps. Idk if I’m weird for this, but simming is fun now that we have raidbots. I guess it’s just all mindset. 
---
Some people like to min/max. Let them. That's how they enjoy the game.
---
Front-stabbing will not be possible in classic. It is entirely a private server thing having to do with server refresh rates.
---
Min-maxing is fun for me. I will do it because it’s my favorite part of modern wow just as much as it will be my favorite part of classic wow.
---
He did okay during vanilla. He said so himself. Not sure what your source is ?
---
Yo, what's that action bar / UI add-on?
---
&lt;scrubs&gt; and &lt;hardcore&gt; don't experience the same raid content, though. The gear-gated nature of the content made sure of that. The vast majority of the playerbase, almost certainly less than 1% of the population, never set foot in Naxx during Vanilla. 
---
I can guarantee they'll be plenty of parents playing. I just don't see why servers need to be shorter than 3 years. I dont want my progress reset. Maybe make an alt or 2? Just don't delete my server please, it's half the reason I don't play pservers
---
So go find a different guild? That guild isn't giving you what you want, so why would you stay?
---
This is prime copy pasta material right here.
---
I would 100% sign up for &lt;Mediocre&gt; that sounds perfect. -&gt;Resto Druid and Fury warrior / 5-man tank
---
Fear ward has a 30 second cd
---
Too right. Just let people play how they want to play. If you join a casual raiding guild, don't complain that people are playing like casual players - and similarly don't complain that people are challenging themselves to go full hardcore and get their BiS items asap
---
You can rest assured I will min/max until every single bit of fun is gone.
---
Because that’s what’s fun for me
---
Okay will try it with my next char
---
I quit my job to clear naxx and I don't regret it.  I was like 17 or 18.
---
Dwarf Paladin. Beer and Light man, that's my shit
---
I ran the dungeon 100 times in a row solo lvl 70 drood to avoid that 1 out of 5. RNG is a bitch. No mount for me. 
---
And for Taurens since they can't ride normal undead horses.
---
People take druid heals for 5 man's all the time.
---
Dungeon set 2 with current knowledge isn't really worth getting for most classes but that's not intentional. You're right in terms of blizzard implementing it but there is much better gear that you can generally get over that set, intentional or not.
---
lol you assume much
---
ok how about this, the surgeon gets to raid and postpone my surgery but i get a share of the loot. i'm fine with risking death for some t3
---
It is NOT known.
---
I'm not arguing that. I'm arguing the notion that the lack of said ability makes a priest player unwanted. It is rare that a raid has so many priests that you have to sort people out. 
---
Even more rare that there are 2 players with equal skill, gear, attitude where the only factor deciding who goes in is the race they've chosen. In the grand scheme of things that is far less important than the other attributes I've just listed.
---
but shaman can tank
---
And I don't get why. Tanking is so much more fun that playing a boring DPS in a 5man. I wouldn't want to tank in a raid though, that's too much pressure. But in a 5man? Anyday.
---
No character copying
---
Now I want to make each of those guilds on my server and see how they perform ;) 
---
I played an ally warrior in vanilla. Warlocks where usually pretty easy kills because they can't fear a warrior for the most part.
---
This is pretty much how it happens as far as I know. The server knows where the stealthed player is but it doesn't tell the other player until he/she does something to reveal (e.g. nova) this has the same latency as any other spell in the game. 
---
If the server told the client where a stealthed player was and the client didn't reveal it as you suggest this would be easily exploitable (see all invisible player haxx l33t) and not a good idea. 
---
Not to say you couldn't detect an exploit with anticheat but why bother for a 0.1s (100ms ping average shall we say) speed increase.
---
Lol you sound like a perfect fit for our guild &lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; unless you're already in there and I just dont know your reddit name ;). 
---
Also spirit is good for Priest healers. Human Priest is not as great as Dwarf. But not that far behind. Only NE Priest is far behind compared to Dwarf and Human.
---
I was the first person to get the mount on Azgalor as a Human Paladin =D Felt gud. 
---
Would it be possible to solo at 60 with a decked out char?
---
Don't suck and groups will have no problem taking you as a druid healer. I hated not having a rez at first, but it actually made my runs more smooth. DPS know they can't be retarded because they'll die and have to run back.
---
Another side benefit is not having to be on rez duty during raids. 
---
Well droprate was 0.02% so you would probably need a bit more than 100 runs :)
---
Had a level 60 night elf hunter and 60 human mage back in the day (actually still do, and still wearing their classic vanilla gear, lol).  This time around I want to try my first proper horde character, and do a somewhat different role.  As of now I want to do a Tauren Shaman.
---
Go check out some private server parses. 
---
Well I think this is a non-issue. The first time you stop and smell the roses, and then, when you think you have completed the game, you can start all over again in min-max mode. It's like unlocking hard-mode, and makes Classic WoW ridiculously long, which is a good thing. 
---
Ya I feel like a dick for toss this post up here now. I hope I am right but knowing my luck that coworker mistook a private sever for a beta.
---
Good chance.
---
No. Way.
---
Classic will never be classic to me while wowhead will have an indepth guide to what gear you need for every class that everyone adheres to so hard that all the adventure is gone. It's unavoidable, it's old and mastered.
---
In vanilla or in general very early WoW raids weren't in the center of the game. As the game knowledge increased in pservers raids become a common thing and got theorycrafted by modern standards. Now you can have a \~20 second boss fights in MC with pre-AQ gear. The encounters are mechanically easy compared to modern ones but what mechanics there are - they usually are a one-shot if you fail it. Even "professionals" can suddenly wipe from a random facepull or if a healer gets to close melee on Rag or feral shapeshifts out. Raids will wipe on guild breaker on firemaw, on chromagus, on nelf and in many other places. Many may not do AQ40 due to time and effort required. Even when the design looks simple the game is challenging and people that play it constantly on pservers over and over (FRESH) do it for the adventure and progress not for the raid instance challenge itself.
---
Yes, the main thing you want is the weapon with the higher high end damage in your MH
---
He's right that WoW doesn't send info about stealthed players to the people around them, this is actually the reason you hear the stealth sound when a stealthed player gets close to you, it wasn't originally intended. When the stealth buff gets applied it plays that sound and when the server tells the client about a stealthed player the client has to make a character and apply the buff to them, so the sound plays
---
Dungeon Set 2 is pretty good compared to MC equipment, which allows you to skip a raid when joining a guild. that doesnt allow the guild to skip MC, but the player
---
People got fired so now they are afraid for their jobs
---
I used to solo certain dungeons on my hunter back in the day, dealing with three mobs at once was never possible without freezing traps from what I remember.
---
So not speed, its about top end dmg?
---
Yes, its just that slower weapons have higher top end damage which is why rule of thumb is just put the slower weapon in your MH. 
---
My only issue is when private server players try to impose the "PLAY THIS AND LIKE THIS OR YOU ARE BAD AND WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING" mindset on people just now getting interested in the game. 
---
Yes, wasn't uncommon for higher end guilds to sell spots in raids they had on farm to people. Some might charge for the run, others would have a pricelist for gear. I paid a raid that was clearly BWL weekly 25g for their raid ID each week just for the alchemy lab, was much more convenient than clearing a dungeon to use it.
---
I played as resto all through vanilla for both dungeons and raids. I can't remember gear being much of an issue, but I was only interested in healing gear as I didn't play feral at all at 60. Quite often had a priest or shaman along as dps so the rez was rarely a problem either. Usually just best to discuss beforehand about people rolling on off spec gear.
---
i would put shadowpriests and warlocks easily above rogues in duels and mages on the same lvl
---
in world pvp rogues come right after hunters imo. unless best at world pvp to you means waiting for someone to sit down eating before engaging.
---
in premade battlegrounds they are pretty useless. you can find a niche for any class that doesnt make it good.
---
overall a very good class. "relevant the most"? nah
---
It has been patched out in 1.8
---
Gotta say my favorite pairing for my warrior was always a druid. Their roots are handy when they're kiting. 
---
Love this comment dude
---
It has been patched out in Patch 1.8. When you /sit you will still get critted but it will no longer Procc Reckoning or other on critt abilities. Same patch also made Reckoning stack to 5 max
---
[PFUI](https://shagu.org/pfUI/) - it's quite nice. 
---
If you're leveling and go 24 points into subtlety, why not get Deadliness? Are the early combat talents better? I know it prevents you from getting the later Combat talents, but you'll be almost 60 at that point anyway and you'll have had more time with the AP bonus.
---
Need to decide between UD priest or Tauren Warrior.
---
Got both in Vanilla and loved almost equally... 
---
Fortunately there is still some time to make my mind :D
---
An MMO game like WoW has a very fragile balance. You change one thing and it will affect indirectly countless more things. People are fine with how it is currently, so don't want a change in fear it may be for the worst.
---
Like, lets make druid even more viable for tanking! Now druid gets a power up in pvp as well. Due to the increased resilience they might get stupidly strong in PvP. They are already one of the toughest class ingame, thanks to bear form and the heals, what happens if you slap more mitigation on top of it?
---
Warriors can do nothing else besides tanking and dpsing. At least they can do those 2 things really well. They suck in owPvP alone, which is a huge con, but they get rewarded by being the best dps and tank ingame. Lets say druids become better tanks than warriors. How would the warrior-players feel about a class that is capable of healing, having crapton of support/utility, being also better at tanking? They would really be angry, wouldn't they?
---
The current meta isn't perfect but at least people have accepted it in the past 10+ years. Boomkins suck with mana, but people know that upfront and those few using the form use it with pride anyway.
---
Mate maybe i'm misunderstanding you when you say break target. Do you refer to say that it gets you out of combat? Cuz if you say shadowmend gets you out of combat in classic wow, like it does in modern wow, you are just a noob. Cheers hope I misunderstood what you ment. 
---
Lots of comments saying their client doesn’t know you exist, so no ripples. What about non-combat pets? Didn’t they initially show even when stealthed, and then that got changed later?
---
Hell no, even in full tier 3 you'd very likely struggle/probably couldn't  duo it. 
---
Warrior. And very likely tank.
---
Was my main since 2005  until 2015, tank.
---
My doubt is if I should go Nelf like my original toon for maximum nostalgia or go Human, and not because of racial skills, but rather the whole issue with shield sizes. Male nelf went from using scaled up shields to match it's height to literally using pocket watches sometime through classic.
---
Yea but OP made it sound like they were playing on one in both comment I replied to and the head post imo.
---
Is arguing about rogues the new autistic thing this sub is gonna do for 2 weeks?
---
Yeah man, at the time I first tried it I was in AQ20 and was pretty low on the Dps chart with 8% hit and deathbringers, my crit chance went way up putting Edgemasters on, and at the time they were only 30 gold. 
---
Pulled aggro and died almost immediately first try.
---
I put a lot of (?) because the numbers are pretty fuzzy in my memory.
---
One of the links I provided referenced the glance chance to go down to 20% from 40%, but back then the mechanics were not very well understood, only that top 1% that made it to nax endevored to know how the game actually worked.
---
And if you thought WoW was a grind, try out Lineage 2. There was very little actual questing or dungeons at the beginning, everything was open world mob grinding. There was no such thing as item soulbinding and you could end up dropping and losing your gear in PVP. And weapon enchanting? Every time you enchanted a weapon to get a +1 it gave it an escalating chance to be broken and destroyed the next time you enchant it. (If I remember correctly. Its been a long while.)
---
They’d just make BC servers and honestly I don’t see why they wouldn’t I liked BC more than classic and would prefer to play a BC server. Having servers for every expac or at least the first few seems ideal
---
No, you explain to the healer that you will be rolling on healing gear before he join the group and if he has a problem with that he does not join the group.
---
Taking gear for a role that you are currently not filling is stealing loot, even if the group had not been possible without a druid tank the healer deserves to know that he has to roll against the tank for healing items.
---
Also if you are healing specced why wouldent anyone take you to dungeons? Druids are excellent healers for dungeons but if you are uncertain about the groups performance find a hybrid dps if you are worried people will die and the runback is long.
---
Joining as melee dps on private servers is also viable, aswell as being second healer in ubrs run if the first healer is a priest.
---
I can only speak for myself, but I've stuck with mine for 14 years, so a few more is no problem ;) Kind of astonishing to see druids above priests though!
---
Haha. I remember that exact quest. The dumb  samurai sword that replaced whatever 2h epic you walked into that expansion with 
---
Horde side then.  You poor bastards don't get Blessing of Salvation. I did ez-mode (for a tank) with Ally side.  You haven't had any issues on Broodlord or Nef with your tanks getting shredded running such aggressive gear?  Or any drama from the DPS while handing DFTs out to tanks?  I never went that hard into TPS gear, even for Ony or Vael.  Always sword and board and full plate, just might swap out 3-5 pieces for more aggressive stuff.  Lionheart was about the only actual armor piece that comes to mind.  I certainly never dropped out of Shield Slam in my spec.  That's interesting.  Would love to see a side-by-side of threat gen numbers if you have them.  If not I can do my own theory crafting in the next couple of months.  I'd just be really afraid of not being spongy enough.
---
Prior to WOW I played a MUD where you lost 33% XP when you died. After a couple of years play I had two deaths in 15 minutes and boom, that's me at 44% of the XP I was at. That was BRUTAL.
---
(Although to be honest that probably contributed to me actually graduating University and not spending a third year MUDding rather than studying :-) ) 
---
That's fine answer for me
---
Initially I wanted to respond with "well but let's stop acting like after 16+ years in business Blizzard can't handle some fucking balance tweaks without breaking the game"
---
But yeah... I can't make that argument sadly
---
I'm still against design that involves unused talents etc but I agree that it may be the best we've ever got so it's better to stick to it
---
Perfectly acceptable especially since WC is the first horde dungeon literally there for you to practice group mechanics and get dope loot together.
---
We were 5 friends already, so I fine with that.
---
Also to be specific, you can educate yourself in that, shadowmeld was changed in 3.0 to be usable while in combat.
---
You know private servers tend to make raids harder to compensate for innacurate information! 
---
Yeah I don't understand people like that, one person playing a night elf priest won't ruin your life so why be a little bitch about it?
---
Cool idea! Try to record what was great about it and what challenges there are. It might be a awesome way to learn a new language for many people especially if a lot of the ground work has been worked out!
---
I'm doing druid in classic as well because I love the versatility so much. I just don't think many people realize some of the druid conveniences that didn't exist until later expansions. And yeah I thought there would be so many priests wanting that sweet benediction lol
---
Druid:
---
+ Tank dungeon.     
---
+ Mobility.    
---
+ stealth.  
---
+ Not much downtime.  
---
+ easy solo levelers
---
Lmao no, he's a 100% correct.
---
DPS don't lile waiting for DFT bc it never drops. Tank survivability hasn't been an issue so far. for Broodlord/Nef, tanks use shields (and dw when building aggro). It could change with AQ40 to be honest, buzt so far we've handled DW tanking with full worldbuffs pretty well. cn't give you any TPs numbers unfortunately :/
---
I am really excited to get into a raiding guild, making friends and getting gear. I'm going to be a rogue so i'll have a lot of competition but I am kinda used to it since I was a mage on nostalrius. It has been a life long dream to get bloodfang.
---
I am practicing on my local host server and the practice is well needed since i've never played rogue before.
---
Link the comment?
---
double nova is good
---
That is was a shit idea to implement. Instead of rewarding players for defending goldshire you punish them for engaging in world pvp. 
---
I was a 100% pve players, but i joined in on a lot of fun just like everybody else, getting DHK's fucking sucked even when i had 0 care about rank or need for pvp gear. 
---
1.12 is not the best patch since it has DHK's, I really dont want changes but this shit system could be 100% removed and I think it would only be positive for the game in every way. 
---
So a 1.13 with a removed dishonorable kills is a good 1.13, I dont care about slippery slopes as I dont see many changes that where implementet that had such a negative effect on so much without adding anything or even fixing the problem it was supposed to.
---
Another great thing about classic was learning from each other. It's perfeftly acceptable to offer tips about downranking or waiting for mana between casts, things not everyone will know. There's a way to do it without being an ass though
---
Mediocre will probably invite their internet gf to give her loot
---
Looks great! I have some issues with the Shadow priest tables, there isn't enough hit on that gear and some of the enchants aren't right. I'll leave comments. :)
---
As they should have. Hopefully also regaling you about the quest in there with epic rewards!
---
The first time I ran MC was a private server because I was too much of a noob when vanilla was out. My impressions were that it was a pretty boring raid. The bosses were easy, the loot was crappy, and the art design of the raid was boring. 
---
Your post they are replying too literally assumes because some is &lt;Hardcore&gt; means they are &lt;Asshole&gt;. Anyone who does something a lot is immediately and irrecoverably a jerk and a rager?
---
Min maxing is needed in some form if you want to do AQ and beyond. 
---
Man Scrubs was my guilds name back in the day. Throwback lol. Miss those guys. 
---
Agree 100%. DHK were a cancerous concept. Really killed desire to do city raids.
---
Ehhh I don't think so. &lt;scrubs&gt; stands a much better chance since it's old content, it's all knowledge that is known already. That formula applies better to new stuff.
---
Incorrect.  30% less threat means you can do 42.8% more damage before pulling aggro.
---
As such, the circle of life continues and nature takes its majestic course.
---
Why do so many people think being good and having fun are mutually exclusive? Can't wrap my head around it.
---
They've also never made a classic server before, yet here we are. We have no idea how they will handle classic expansion servers if they ever create them.
---
That sounds like a nightmarish experience devoid of any fun.
---
Still really interesting.  I did the math on my threat gen when I was still tanking and found out that about half of my threat came from melee damage, but shield slam was still pretty significant. Would be interesting to figure out what the spread of threat looked like if one were to go heavy fury and just go deep enough in prot for defiance.  Are you guys going to impale in arms?
---
Then they're no longer &lt;scrubs&gt; but &lt;mediocre&gt;
---
I don't think so. our MT has Bloodthirst specced
---
This sub can be so bad at times with the "everyone should play the game the way I prefer to play" mindset. 
---
Yeah, and moonkin can DPs in raids, too.
---
I'd take a BM pet tank or warlock SL tank over a shaman any day.
---
&gt;implying we weren't doing this in vanilla
---
I believe you'll have a easier time leveling as feral. Won't stop you from healing dungeons but I think you'll have a better time of it and then respecing at 60. Also, remember that not all of your best healing will be leather, don't be afraid of cloth.
---
1. Class viability in what?  End-game PvE?  That is a highly specialized situation, and only highly specialized specs will be optimal there.  But those specs are horrible in other areas of the game.  
---
2. Blasted Lands and Un'Goro are empty and forgotten?  Un'goro is one of my favorite zones and has quite a lot of quests in it.
---
3. Have you actually raided in Vanilla?
---
Vanilla was a unique experience a decade ago, and will be a unique experience again today.  It will be an MMO not built for microtransactions, but where players are expected to see the content.  It will not be designed to funnel you to end-game like every MMO today.
---
Vanilla and the classic era (including TBC and WotLK) were the perfect balance of punishing and accessible which has yet to be recreated again.  And you want to mess with that?
---
You don’t really need to raid though. 
---
No build is truly unused. This gets blown out of proportion. For example in my current (leveler) guild the 2nd in command plays as a boomkin. I've seen ton or ret paladins. Will most of these players respec for raiding? Probably. But those specs will still be used. I don't doubt that you'll see a few boomkins in PvP with their big crit and oneshot potential. Are they the best for that role? No. Will people still play it? Yes.
---
It's very unlikely that **anybody** will turn you down?  No, it's highly likely that **someone** will turn you down.
---
PVE, PVP or both? For PVE, alchemy+herbalism would work well as you've suggested. For PVP, herbalism+engineering would give you a source of income, reagents and essential PVP equipment. You can do it on one character if you start as a miner and send your bars to another character to hold.
---
Humans = best PVE rogue (+5 swords), weakest PVP rogue  
---
Orc = best Horde PVE rogue (Blood Fury) and in my eyes best PVP rogue (stun resist)  
---
Undead = worst PVE rogue, second best Horde PVP (fear break)  
---
Troll = close second for Horde PVE (Berserking), worst Horde PVP race as the alternates are so strong  
---
Gnome/Dwarf = best Alliance PVP rogues, go with the one you prefer as both have a great racial (escape artist vs stoneform). Gnomes get +15 engineering which makes me prefer it out of the two
---
Also note that they were added AFTER the PvP system was implemented, and promptly removed from the game in TBC.
---
They only existed in a short window of like 9 months in  vanilla.
---
They really have no part in classic wow, and were in every way a terrible system.
---
Much better comment than your original reply, kudos. I don't happen to agree though as you managed to point out certain classes and specs that may be better in particular niches than Rogues, and I'm not going to try to convince you that you're wrong because honestly we both have strong opinions here and neither of us are particularly wrong in those instances, however. I do think you missed the point a bit. So Rogues may not be #1 across the board, but it's my opinion they hold their own across multiple niches better than any other class. I'm not saying they are considerably better than those other classes, or that they are even better, just that when looking across the board of things you can do in the game, Rogues are more consistent, thus relevant.
---
I'm also a big fan of hemo for leveling, going for prep at later levels. Your kill speed is obviously going to be slower than combat, but you can somewhat make up for it with reduced downtime. You can split packs of humanoids with imp sap and take them on one by one, or at least in smaller groups. This opens up possibilities for places to grind solo that aren't as practical as they would be for combat swords. 
---
While combat focuses your specialization on kill speed, subtlety makes you better at the more intangible rogues do: stealth, cc, evasion-tanking, etc. I won't try to argue that hemo-sub is faster than combat at leveling, but I think it provides a more enjoyable and rogue-ish experience.
---
It also allows more flexibility with weapons, though admittedly this isn't a terribly big deal since most of the best weapons at any level are swords.
---
If you find something, let me know! I found one that will check if you have X buff, but tracking doesnt show up on the buff bar. Not sure if this will work.
---
If people min/max now, they will when classic comes. Does it matter? No, not really. You choose your own enviroment, and I guarantee that there will be alot of "Vanilla-like" guilds in classic, that will take anything and anyone.  
---
But even then, please remember this. Chances are that after over a decade, 10 of your 40 raiders will no longer die due to DCing, low fps, or just plain standing in fire for 10 seconds. PCs have got better. I predect that raid content is going to be very trivial, very quickly, regardless of where in the game youre at.
---
It has been confirmed the release is not affected, and many posts have been made about it. Searching is faster and easier than making a new post.
---
Its such a huge difference. Its almost like an apology for all the undead rogues that will murder your alliance warlock with WOTF.
---
I'm not very much into minmaxxing, so id prefer dwarf, I'm just curious if Horde is worth exploring. If I were to go Horde I think I like troll most tbh. 
---
This is exactly what I’m looking for. I already cleared Naxx back in vanilla so I don’t need to chase progression. I just want to have fun and kill some bosses after my kids are in bed. Going to need some gear to camp BRM again like the old days. 
---
you know, this is a situation where a lot depends on the rest of the group, especially the tank. because it's quite easy for rest of the two dps to pull back and stop doing damage, or the healer to stop healing, but it all hangs on the tank to do just enough threat to pretend everything is alright before letting the mobs descend on the asshole and tear him apart.
---
but your solution might be better - even though you had to suffer through the guys temper tantrums, the payoff is more than worth it.
---
I agree 100%
---
Nobody will care for what reason what I am going to play but my decision is a Nightelf female Hunter just because I mained a Hunter in Classic as well and I fell in love with archers back in Wc3 tft because they were just amazing units and I won lots of 1vs1s with them in the most ridiculous ways. 
---
I can certainly say (I had lots of time in Vanilla as a kid and appropriately I could deal with min maxing my hunter) that I was one of the best hunters on my realm and it was fun.
---
Love to the hunter class and nostalgia affected my decision to main hunter again.
---
Let yourself guide instinctively what you should play or not. Often the first thought is the most suitable for your preferred playstyle.
---
Sorry for bad worddiction I am not a native english speaker.
---
Dont kid yourself. They will drag everyboy down and will take twice as long as with a normal tank.
---
You constantly have to drink, your tank gear does not improve past dungeon +def gear.
---
You blow through mana worse than an elemental. When a decently geared warrior is done fighting, his healer is at 65-80% mana, the warrior will run up to the next group, start the positioning, marking, range pulling while the tank shaman is still replenishing his mana that drops to 20% each fight.
---
If something goes wrong, there is no oh shit button and the group is more prone to wipes.
---
Yep.  i'm in the restaurant industry.  Employees both drop like flies and are a dime a dozen for a body to replace you.  This is my career and I'm passionate about it, so I'm going to go into work, make a couple hundred dollars instead of raiding once a month and I don't want to have that "Let your job down, or let your guild down" dilemma.
---
I’m not saying it isn’t an important stat, just that the benefit of the racial is minimal.
---
The concern is that the upper eschelon people in &lt;Scrubs&gt; might want to move to a different guild. 
---
I feel like these lower-tier guilds might have a higher turnover rate than the more toughguy guilds. That folks who put in hours out of raid to farm their consumables, gold etc. might just naturally progress toward guilds where everybody does that. 
---
Because otherwise, they're putting in this effort, and are ahead of their pals, but not really going anywhere.
---
Everyone on this sub thinks they’ll be clearing naxx.
---
I find it annoying how classiccast crew always talks how aq and naxx are easy yet they never stepped foot in there during retail. 
---
Those were the hardest raids of all time not because mechanics but because back then there was little resources, no dungeon raid journal showing all mechanics. Each guild including mine had to beat the bosses from trial and error to learn the mechanics. 
---
Yeh it’s easy now on private servers after 10 years of theorycrafting and broken mechanics on pservers.
---
I'll be 34 next year.  Job prospects aren't what they were when I was 19/20 in 2004.
---
Honestly I'm getting tired of hostility in responces here
---
Your point with viability is completely fine and I can agree on that
---
There were dead zones in vanilla which were mid to end game zones and no-one doing shit there. I felt that way while playing I'm and I'm that kind of fucker that goes to every cave on map just to see what's there. Felwood/azshara/10k needles and some other fantastic zones were underused in my opinion
---
I raided in Vanilla and it was hard af at the time but I argue that it had nothing to do with mechanics, but just overall freshness of game concepts that in 2019 won't feel like any nuance
---
I agree with everything below and I don't want to mess with anything just wanted to hear another people's opinions Jesus Christ
---
People fail to realize that "casual" vanilla raiding actually requires greater time commitment and effort. (I am not counting frustration in)
---
When you'll be farming gold to spend 6 hours clearing MC in 2 days, "nolife nerds" will be drinking beer with netflix and chill. 
---
Why? Because "nolife nerds" spend one evening to clear MC+BWL+Ony and have the rest of the week free. They don't need to farm gold since the boss drops sum up to ~100g each week and that's more than enough to fund your next runs. And it does not take the biggest brain to become that "nerd" in 15 y.o. game when every piece of information you need is available. 
---
First you bring the role, then you bring the player, the class comes after those two. 
---
1 paladin or priest might be axed because you really want mark of the wild but if the druid is a asshat that dont know how to play I might have taken the priests and the paladins every time instead of bringing someone that I only want for the buff. Since i can recruit a usefull druid to the next raid or the one after that I'll take a few raids without a druid then bringing someone that has the wrong kind of mentality (the problem is not being bad but refusing to learn and adapt on your own, but especially if you put time and energy into teaching someone but their behaviour is still shit)
---
And if you need 14 healers they wont really care whatever those healers are druid or priests unless you have priests and paladins to spare, which guilds usually dont. Dps sure, but having too many healers is usually not a problem so worrying about there being too many healers AND druids for you to join seems a bit far fetched. Some guild will be needing those healers and if there really is too many healers server wide there will be a tank or dps shortage, meaning a druid will come in handy.
---
But the sign says “Accepted forms of payment: Gold or Bear Asses of Exceptional Quality”
---
Next decision, male or female rogue? :) I never liked the idea of male dwarf/orc rogues as they just look too clumsy, I used to have female dwarf and orc rogues though and they looked cool. Troll rogues just look awesome regardless of sex.
---
Welcome to “Changes!”: the subreddit
---
Or Herbs. No one ports for free.
---
For warirors, its actually a pretty massive advantage because you're harder to kite due to how much further out your melee range is, and that it screws with hunter dead ones. Frost mages need to move a pretty big distance further to get a frost nova In and be out of melee range.
---
For tauren casters, its a disadvantage because your bigger hitbox gives melee more range to hit you.
---
If I had the choice I would roll tauren rogue.
---
There'll be plenty, I assure you.  We're still out there, just lying dormant...
---
Me? I'll probably be playing the AH game trying to get epic riding off of flipping items/mats.  Might be gone for 3 weeks because work's got me stressed out or my friend came into town.
---
I saw Rivendares mount drop one time in Classic in a 10 man Stratholme run. The gnome rogue that got it was also the only person I knew on my former realm that owned it. It was extremely rare possibly the rarest mount obtainable through a dungeon drop in WoW history.
---
Hybrids for the most part need a mana/5 talent at the end of there trees exactly like they do in TBC! That's the most change I want to see for class tweaking. I mean shamans &amp; druids nature dmg too need a way DPS bosses well. Also rework redoubt honestly, it doesn't make sense to give crit incentive as a tank. Maybe give them a taunt, maybe make conc a innate spell, maybe give tankadins a Mana talent. Make shaman stormstrike a buff not debuff, and we're good. That's all the changes that need to happen.
---
There is no current climate, the game isn't even out yet!
---
I'm going to throw a curveball from the other posts.  Typically, I want to bring the best I possibly can.  Min/maxing to me doesn't just mean getting the best cookie cutter build.  It also means knowing what to sacrifice in order to get something else that's not in the cookie cutter (i.e. 1% crit off of your spells, 1% mana cost on your spells, or 3% healing by a specific spell...which do you sacrifice?)  But it still means bringing the best I possibly can, while also getting that other thing.
---
With that said, especially if you're playing casually and won't have the level of practice or dedication that a hardcore raider might have, it is in your best interest to get every advantage available.
---
If I'm picking spots for a raid, the most important thing to me is that the other players do what they need to in order to be successful.  In guild, it was generally required that you be fully enchanted, bring your consumables, etc.  You've studied the fights, you've kept up on improving your gear through whatever means are available, and if needed you've ironed out your spec.  Seeing that someone picked dwarf because it would be the most useful is another aspect of that.
---
Now, I did say that min/max means sometimes you do something else, but you maximize your abilities while doing something else.  That applies to race choices to.  If you go human or NE, you can still min/max that and be the best raider you can be.  Being dwarf is basically a 1-point bonus.  For example, I might give a point each for:
---
1. Shows up on time and/or communicates well regarding schedule conflicts
---
2. Takes responsibility for mistakes and puts genuine effort to fixing them
---
3. Consistently works towards improving character during off-hours (i.e. farming for a BoE, doing dungeon runs to replace a quest green)
---
4. Shows up to raids fully stocked on consumables, repaired, and ready to raid
---
5. Knows the class and takes effort to continue learning more about the class
---
6. Helps guildies with content that is beneath them, for example running a dungeon you don't need any gear for
---
7. Effectively communicates during raids
---
8. Knows which gear and which stats are beneficial to make the most out of upgrades
---
9. Consistently evaluates their character's build and performance to find areas of improvement
---
10. Is dwarf
---
Based on the above, if you meet 9 of the 10 requirements, but are not a dwarf, then you get 9 points.  And then if there's someone who shows up for raid on time, but is unprepared, takes no responsibility for his abilities, and has no social graces, but he is a dwarf, he'll get 2 points.
---
If it gets to the point where I have to pick someone for a specific fight, and you two are similar in work ethic, then I might base it on gear or on who is or isn't a dwarf, depending on the fight.
---
Ok, as someone else pointed out I restricted my thinking to end game pve which narrowed everything down
---
I guess vanilla had it's magic anyway because people tried all the shit and had fun anyway
---
Thanks for the respondes they were insightful 
---
i got your point. and i agree that nobody will be convinced here.
---
to me:
---
mages are equally good duellers
---
stronger in pve, especially lategame
---
way more worth in bgs, especially premade
---
slightly behind in world pvp
---
i wont count in that mages are the strongest class for gold farming together with hunters, allthough thats quite a relevant game aspect too.
---
The Big Love Rocket is probably more rare simply because it's a holiday daily drop. 
---
I can't really say you're wrong.  It was a product of its time.  Up until entering MC, none of us had ever grouped with more than 10-15 people, tops.  All the enemies we fought were roughly our size, and the dungeons were generally of a "modest" size.
---
Then you enter Molten Core.  It's absolutely massive inside - basically feels as if there's no roof.  Immediately in front of you are two of the biggest NPCs you've ever seen.  No, you're not just pulling them one at a time...you have to fight **both** of these bastard at the same time!
---
And it just all dovetails from there.  It was such a unique and novel experience *at the time.*  When people say "Classic will fail because it's just nostalgia!" - they're generally wrong IMO.  But it might be true for MC specifically.  Even back in the vanilla days, I started to fall asleep during MC raids because it got pretty boring and uninteresting lol.
---
But it'll always have a special place in my gamer heart.  When I hear the word "raid" - MC is still what I first think of.
---
It was a great raid to fall asleep to ;). That said, I was an Rdruid just spamming healing touch which doesn't help keep the mind active.
---
Yep. I have no intention of joining a guild, or raiding. Don't care to raid. I just like leveling and doing small groups with randos I meet. 
---
Sometimes I'll stalk the other faction and surprise help them when then get overwhelmed. 
---
I personally advocate for the ability to keep my characters on a TBC server or a Vanilla server, my choice.  I'm okay with the TBC servers being fresh.  To a lesser extent with TBC being forced, but fresh Vanilla servers being launched (this way, it keeps Vanilla fresh, but I do understand that forcing the change on players isn't a good thing).
---
The way I see it is this:  Vanilla was fun for me, but TBC is where my hearth is.  I want to do Kara, and Zul'Aman, and I want the class balance of TBC, and the PvP system of TBC, and pretty much everything of TBC.  I want to group a Shaman and a Paladin together.  I want to tank on a Paladin.  I want to roll Lifeblooms again (something I haven't been able to do without a cooldown since WotLK launched).  I want to do it all.
---
And I eventually want to raid Ulduar, which was the best damn raid the game has ever seen.
---
I like Vanilla well enough and it will keep me occupied for years with the goals I have.  But I can do those same goals and more in TBC.
---
DHKs, like the fame of the Kardashians, are proof that we live in a computer simulation and that whoever is running the show likes to throw in illogical elements to see how we react. 
---
Some people actually defend DHKs, which is valuable data for the experimenters. 
---
This right here. 
---
I presume you won’t be spending a majority of your time wpvping in this combo, so it shouldn’t change your class choice. Having a 2nd player to back you up in the open world is going to be responsible for a lot more successful kills and fights than what class that 2nd player is.
---
Don't tell me how to play the game
---
You knowingly posted an unpopular opinion.  Don't be surprised if the responses are negative.
---
The reason they're hostile is because we've fought tooth and nail for over a decade to get Classic servers, and we don't want them ruined by someone who comes along and craps all over the game we used to love.
---
Depends on what your perceived goals are. 
---
Same here. Did about 40+ runs at lvl70.
---
It would be great if we'd support them instead of doubting them all the freakin time. Arent you happy at all for Classic?
---
.. So much negativity. 
---
Azshara is about the only one I'll agree with you on, but it still is completely populated by mobs and has a lot of class quests.
---
Felwood had a ton of content, you must not have been in the right spot.  Same with 10k.
---
About deleting your account 😏
---
There are always guilds who need healers so you will have no problem finding a raiding spot if your trying to heal.
---
The best move you can make in this game is joining a guild of like minded people at 60. Even if the guild is just starting out its game changing for doing attunement quests and farming pre bis in dungeons. 
---
Battlemasters. I tried both and yea its cool to travel to the bg zones but at the end of the day I want ques to pop fast enough.
---
Why? There are different communities for hardcore and casual players. Just let them do what they want. 
---
Every attempt is one chance. But statistically you're right.
---
Another great point people seem to forget is that Druids are fantastic for winning WSG battles as they are the perfect flag carriers in Vanilla. Otherwise Druid seems to have everything you are looking for. Great sustain for PvE, can do all roles and are pretty fun too.
---
Melee hunters are valuable. They are the best class for designated Nightfall wielder in a raid. 
---
You will have a great leveling experience, bar the 1-10 horrid shitshow. Feral is a great spec for leveling.
---
Do understand that Resto playstyle in Classic consists of mostly casting Healing Touch rank 4 and occasional Rejuv. You will never *ever* use Regrowth. Ever. It is insanely inefficient. You may use it during leveling however.
---
You will have a easy time getting a raid spot, especially on Horde, as NE Druids are more popular than Tauren Druids.
---
You cannot res others, but its really not as big of a deal as people make it out to be. When you wipe in a dungeon, you are doing a corpse run in most cases unless you have a Warlock who soulstones.
---
to compete in premade vs premade you do, and that's my favorite part of the game, so I will grind through the raids as efficiently as possible, if you don't consider them a grind thats fine, but I do.
---
Hello there and welcome to the cult!  
---
Warlocks do not get any threat reduction from their talents (in their normal DPS specs) nor a threat reset like Hunters or Rogues. Because of this, we tend to hang around the tank in threat and need to make liberal use of [LIPs](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3387)
---
Salvation, along with the other paladin blessings + Dwarf [Fear Ward](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=6346) is going to give you an easier time in PvE content.   
---
Also if you so chose you can play gnome which has a higher DPS cap due to the [intellect racial](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20591) (It is very minor). Aswell in premade BGs paladins and their [Blessing of Freedom](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=1044) and other goodies make up more than enough for facing against UD.  
---
Going to break down Totems vs Blessings. First of you got to know you are way less likely to receive a shaman in your group for totems. Shamans get prioritized in melee groups for [WF](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=10614). So by the time you see a shaman in your group for tranquil are you need about 6 of them in your raid already. Something fairly rare to happen.  
---
[Salvation](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25895) vs [Tranquil Air](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25908) is a 10% difference in threat reduction.  
---
[Wisdom](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25918) vs [Mana Spring](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=10497) is an 8 Mp5 difference  
---
[Kings](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25898) is a 10% stat difference as there is no Shaman equivalent  
---
[Judgement of Wisdom](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20357) if used as a debuff also gives you a chance on 59 mana per hit (averages out to 29,5)  
---
[Blessing of Protection](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=10278) is essentially another LIP/ OH shit button that a paladin can use on you in case you get to high on threat. You will however not be able to cast anymore until the buff is done /canceled.
---
Due to all these things, you will see more Alliance locks than Horde locks in the top parses.  
---
I hope this answered your question and helps you with making a decision.  
---
Whatever the choice ends up being I would like to invite you over to the [Classic Warlock discord](https://discord.gg/cEJkCUc).  
---
We are always looking for fellow cultist and plenty of helpful people and lock resources in there (as well as a spreadsheet that will allow you to simulate the DPS and TPS output difference) :).  
---
Greetings,  
---
Zephan
---
I would perhaps disagree with your statement about warriors being poor in wPvP. If the warrior is under geared they will absolutely get their ass kicked, but a geared warrior can obliterate people in wPvP if played correctly and is appropriately geared. I used to main warrior in Vanilla and once I got geared, the majority of people who tried to gank me......ended up dead.
---
And that's funny, because people that are all about community being main aspect of their beloved game act like pretentious jerks towards other people that also are part of their community
---
I won't be surprised if classic fails miserably because that whole glorified community just turned to elitist circlejerk
---
I love that game to the core and that's why I want to spend time on this sub theoretising with others how the game could be even better and people get more protective about vanilla than junkies about their crack
---
Not every change ruins everything, but maybe Blizzard has taught us the worst about that sadly
---
Most private servers are easier as there are tons of bugs, for example one that makes glancing blows non-existent.
---
I mainly plan to play to ambush motherfuckers in STV with my hunter and whoever I find to support me. Yippee ki yay!
---
He almost certainly wasn't a mythic raider either 
---
I consistenty clear cthun weekly as a raider with pretty much only raiding in mind nowadays, and i can tell you felwood and blasted lands are probably the most used zones in the game for me. I guess coming from a retail pov this wont make much sense, but in vanilla there are resources in almost every corner of the map. You will always be going to felwood, blasted lands, winterspring, and ferelas. There are resources in ungoro, burning steppes, epl/wpl, hell even arathi and badlands that all have competitive gph. In fact besides the arrival of flying, this is why many vanilla players dislike tbc, even when on paper it appears tbc fixes many many issues of vanilla while keeping rpg aspects. Tbc totally invalidated the entire world and restricted you to -only- 7 zones. In vanilla you will literally go to over half the zones on a regular basis
---
The zones felt empty on very high populated retail server more than a decade ago in Wow's prime
---
Yeah I get the distrust of Blizzard to develop an actual whole MMO, but raid design is the one area where modern WoW is actually doing an amazing job.
---
Warlocks will 100% have a higher quantity of players. Someone did the math about a week ago on here and showed that a correctly specc'd WL has around 13.000 effective HP with sacrifice and all their other tricks. 
---
How about let other people play the game how they enjoy and stop trying to tell them they won't have fun. 
---
I was just leveling a gnome mage and was wondering this about snow in Dun Morogh
---
That's not the case in the big ones I won't name, the one that got birthed thanks to Nost. Those are the only ones worth considering. 
---
&gt; the upper eschelon people in &lt;Scrubs&gt; might want to move to a different guild
---
Just let them.
---
If &lt;Scrubs&gt;'s purpose is to chill out and have fun, it does no good to anyone to turn a whole guild upside-down just because a few individuals made the wrong choice for themselves.
---
Be very clear about the goals of your guild so eschelon people will join what's better suited to their playstyle and you won't see that much of a turn-over in yours.
---
Don't forget that top players are always a minority of the playerbase in every game, so &lt;Scrubs&gt; guilds will always have a much broader pool to take people in from.
---
Is "struggling with early and easy raid content until everyone quits because they are burned out from terrible raids?" the goal?
---
As a member of &lt;Scrubs&gt; throughout the entirety of TBC and Wrath, I think you're wrong.
---
Of our usual 25 raiders, approximately half of them were amazing players who would have fit in and even excelled in &lt;Hardcore&gt;.  But a lot of us were in college and didn't want to commit to more than ~2 nights of raiding per week.  So we stayed with &lt;Scrubs&gt;, rarely clearing any content until we could farm the easier parts of the next tier up to help us out, and struggling all along the way.  But even though we had 5-10 players who would crater over and over again on Archi, we had fun playing together, and I stand by that.  I'd rather have fun failing with people I like than progress in a guild that feels like a job.
---
Yeah I remember TBC made Azeroth feel like a wasteland that's totally true. Maybe I'm just wrong about all of this shit and tbh I hope so because I have the same feeling about vanilla being the best wow experience in terms of social activity in the game
---
More of this. 
---
This isn't retail.  What you did 10 years ago will not happen in today's game 
---
If memory serves me correctly, rogue is the second slowest leveling class, with the highest falloff rate.
---
I always loved 1K, but it got overshined by other zones so I personally put it mid-tier. I will say tho, running across the bridges and what have you was really, really cool and I wish more zones were like that.
---
Can’t wait to go back tho, I always loved that one egg quest where you have to fight a flying hakkar looking alien, but I don’t remember anything happening after that, like, the whole alien thing was sort of dropped there iirc and I thought that was a shame cuz it was a cool questline that could’ve/should’ve been continued.
---
That makes sense. The first time i ran a dungeon (deadmines) my mind was blown lol.
---
The OP is arguing for scrubs.
---
Mediocre will adopt min maxing but not be able to optimize it as much as the hardcore.
---
Dwarf females will always make me think you're a Chinese gold farmer. 
---
So your goal is raiding. 
---
And then at 60, I for one plan on farming and getting my fun playing the Auction House, with perhaps some casual PvP and pug-raiding tossed in.  Once everyone else has moved on to AQ, I'd expect pugs to be able to make some decent progress in MC.
---
Did the same thing lol, never saw it drop or even saw anybody with it
---
that is also possible, but only with battlemasters
---
Casual4lyfe
---
Yeah that's what I'm planning on. Here's my planned leveling build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZEMMscbdtV
---
and raiding build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLZZxEcqeqio
---
Let me know if they suck and what to change!
---
I do believe there will big a big chunk of us when it's released. Whether it be family or job responsibility
---
The OP is arguing against "min max" aka doing the raids effectively.
---
There will be lots of guilds full of newer players without recent experience with the content.  If they strive to "min max" then they will become mediocre and experience success.  
---
Anyone who doesn't care about "min max" and just wants to goof around in raids will fail
---
Imagine classic servers are down in saturday night and no IT guy is available on call because of reasons..
---
&gt; Wisp form while dead is the strongest racial in the game for world PvP by a landslide
---
This is actually agree with. It's totally underrated and literally saves hours for PvE and wPvP activities. In some instances I have managed to get back to my body before the enemy has even finished regenerating and managed to get my revenge instantly. This coupled with the druids speed is a huge benefit and overlooked.
---
I think you are wrong, and again are underestimating the value of playing with the people I like rather than the people who are good at the game.
---
I have literally no raid ambitions.  None.  So maybe I'll join a casual guild, and we'll have to pug some people to finally get MC cleared by the time everyone else is in AQ and Nax.  That's ok!  I'd rather do that than join a serious guild.
---
Yeah they're not brilliant (probably mid tier) levellers - But I had a blast playing/levelling mine and I found daggers more fun but slower than combat swords.
---
Goals:
---
Get to 60
---
Gear up at 60
---
Kill people
---
Again, there is plenty of content in most of the zones you're criticizing.  I think the issue is that you don't know where the quests are, and not that the zones lack content.
---
Hey, im spanish! I wanted to do exactly the same to improve my poor english skills haha. If you are planning to play in spanish servers when classic came out, we can meet, chat or play together to practice even more! If you want of course \^\^ I think that idea can be fun and is great to try to go outside of "our comfort zone".
---
So, here's my battletag in case you are interested:  Nihil#21158
---
See ya!
---
A human paladin has it on my server. 
---
Classic Wow is long ago, but I remember them as the most stupid thing I can think of. Totally possible I forgot that there was a use for them somewhere.
---
If you are not trying to get the most out of your roster for a raid, you will not be raiding for long.
---
Just how it goes.
---
Honestly. I'd probably stick with Dwarf considering what you have said. Troll is fun for sure, but Dwarf seems to suit your personality more.
---
Saw it drop in my very first run. Didnt win it never seen it again. 
---
Have to tell you a little newbie story. I started to play in legion, and while I was leveling I went through startholme. Well the reins dropped and I was noobing around "hmm have no idea what this crap is, PASS" then I started to realize what happened when our group chat went crazy. My friends still laugh at me for that.
---
(ofcourse needing/greeding wouldn't have meant certain drop for me, but PASS was not a good idea) 
---
Well the fear is that the people leaving will cause the hypothetical 'scrubs' guild to basically be stuck and unable to either progress, or in a worst case scenario, raid at all. 
---
Like the "We keep losing members and bringing in new ones and it's hard to keep up" scenario where either a raid has like 30 members or you don't see the same face twice.
---
There's always a healthy middle ground, of course. My ideal guild is one where you can have roughly 40-ish players, consumables aren't absolutely mandatory, and it's not a problem to have a handful or more who aren't in a super top spec. 
---
On a Pserver that buffed boss HP and damage a good bit, we still had an enh shaman, a boomkin, a feral druid, with room for more like them. We still all needed maxed out consums, but without artificially increased difficulty a la that pserver, I don't know if we'll need them on Classic.
---
At a certain point, the slower speed of &lt;Scrubs&gt; to progress quickly will limit the amount of loot they can acquire which may further gate their progress in further tier. While the first Staff of the Shadow Flame that drops is just as good as the last, &lt;Hardcore&gt; will have a massively improved chance at acquiring more of the best loot, allowing then to push further and faster next tier, and letting more of their members have a chance at the best loot.
---
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Regrowth is used mostly for tank healing and for some larger raid heals if needed (paired with a swiftmend). Druids will have to compete with one another for regrowth, the most +healing is prioritized and lower +healing will not be able to cast over it. Chances are your going to be spamming R3 or R4 healing touch most of the time. Rejuvenation is used sparingly but at max and max rank healing touch is used when tanks are getting hammered, think enrage/transitions and you have Mana to spare.
---
Are you kidding me? Min maxing makes leveling as a warrior a breeze. The right items make life a joke
---
You are not part of the community.  You are a single person who has delusions of grandeur that you can make the game better than it already is.  You have the arrogance to think YOUR changes will improve the game, and the audacity to even think the game needs changing.
---
You knew what community you were talking to.  You purposefully poked the bear and are now complaining that the bear has teeth and claws.  And you have the gall to call us pretentious?
---
This game is called World of Warcrack for a reason, because it's a captivating, addictive game.  Classic is something that's been desperately needed for over a decade, BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO THE GAME.  We need Classic to remain Classic.
---
I've finished every single quest in vanilla including obtaining scepter of the shifting sands, so I believe I am knowledgeable in that matter
---
Yes there were quests there. Yes I've done them. And whilst doing it I barely encountered other players sadly. Maybe I've had bad luck and I'm looking forward to prove myself wrong this summer
---
Any guild who wants to go raid will either adopt the mindset or they will die off quickly
---
Do they spam max rank regrowth on the tank? What’s the logic behind it?
---
So rejuv rank 4 is never touched ?
---
Not really talking about just lvl 60.. you need frontline and strong dps to do dung and level.. not to mention to pvp .\_.
---
Do what you want ? No one forces you to try hard.
---
This is true if you can get on them, something that depends on the environment and specific equiment (engineering devices and similar stuff). If there isn't room to kite you're likely to wreck them. But certain places ( typically flat terrains with no obstacles such as deserts, where they can see u coming) are painful. 
---
You have a problem with people who know how to clear the content? I would stay away from classic wow then
---
If you're primarily a pvp'er like me, and you don't min/max, you're noncompetitive and ruining the experience. It's not fun being noncompetitive in pvp.
---
Absolutely shammy. From what you have said your totems will provide so much utility and added damage that as a duo you will be incredibly strong.
---
Great idea man, good for you.
---
Would love to do this with Russian but I'd worry about the latency playing from Canada.
---
English is not my first language so I always played on English servers and joined English-speaking guilds to improve myself.
---
It worked wonders!
---
Reading text alone is not enough though, if you truly want to learn you'll have to actually interact with people in the language of your choice, it's really the best way to learn.
---
So play on a Spanish server - IF available - and/or at least join a Spanish-speaking guild/group of people, on top of setting the UI in Spanish.
---
Strength only gives melee attack power so its mostly useless to hunters, so I don’t see why one would roll on it.
---
lmao
---
Also if you want a regular vanilla player who also mythic/(heroic) raided every expansion through legion for a fair comparison and point of view, as far as specs go really listen to players when they say specs excel in specific aspects of the game. I can tell you right now as a fury warrior, pvp fucking blows. Im dog shit without arms spec or late talent tree fury stuff (imp intercept) that you never get as a raider. If i see a frost mage im done, but the second i see an opposite faction arcane/frost (frost pve basically) or fire mage(raid spec), theyre toast. 
---
Ret is garbage in pve but they are a hard counter to frost mages in pve. Elemental 30/0/21 will rip your ass apart in pvp. Shadow melts face. A raid geared fury can literally die to a correct specdd level 59 shadow priest. I take my 56 pvp frost mage to silithus and regularly destroy rank 14s. 
---
But pvp and pve are only two aspects of the game. Gold is a real respurce in vanilla and a lot(most!) of your gameplay will revolve around farming gold. Frost mages have to spec aoe deep frost with no frostbite (making them hot garbage in pve and mediocre at best in pvp) to aoe farm, but damn are they the best gold farmer with that spec. Also keep in mind pve dungeon experience is COMPLETELY different from pve raid experience. 
---
As another example ds/ruin lock is nuts in raid but it is probably one of the worst specs in game for world content, mob to mob solo killing/farming, pvp. 
---
And keep in mind this is all max level! Probably 250 hours of your gameplay is leveling up, where BM hunters and wonky priest wand specs are bis. 
---
I know its a long post but really wanna emphasize this cause retail revolves solely around mythic+ pushing and raiding.
---
Down ranking in wc.. Haha ok he must have read some bullshit elites post on how to theory craft the perfect wc run. The good thing about classic was beeing an asshole will give you a bad rep and you will be known on the server. So thats a rip eventually anyway. Best thing is to just block and kick. 
---
&gt; They only existed in a short window of like 9 months in vanilla.
---
Try again. They were added with BGs in 1.5 on June 7, 05. They lasted till BC pre-patch on Dec 5, 06. So like 17 months they existed. Where they didn't exist for about 7 months (Nov 7, 04 US Launch). PVP honor system came out in Apr 8, 05 (So 2 months prior).
---
You are going to be in for a big shock when you play classic.  The raid content was very easy but only seemed hard because people were clueless
---
Now that people know how to properly raid aka "min max" everyone will be crushing the early content
---
I'm eager to announce for you that for the creator of your beloved crack everyone that pays for it is part of the community and may express his thoughts on it
---
You're welcome to continue living in 2004, the release of classic is going to verify reality
---
It's because all the people wanting to excel in wPvP have realized just how damn strong Warlocks are in 1.12.
---
At it's core, World of Warcraft is a game. It is still a game, the most important thing about playing a game is that you are having fun. If you worry too much about min/max when you know that's not what you really feel passionate about, slow down. I'm guilty of it, bfa I swore I was like I'm going to be here for the launch I'm going to gear up fast and raid regularly and clear every week. I did, for about 2 months... And then I realized I'm not having fun anymore. When you're so focused on one thing you forget to sit back and enjoy the actual immersive experience that the world has to offer. I'm now burnout and haven't been subbed for about 3-4 months now and I'm looking at vanilla like a fresh start. I can't wait to make my toon and nostalgia hit me like the first time I downloaded all 3 of those discs (lol). Except, I'm not leveling a Warrior this time.. fuck that !
---
That's exactly the thing. I don't think that everyone is min/maxing just because they want to, it's rather unless you min/max you won't be able to do all the content.
---
Classic had it's min/maxing as well but you didn't need to be too keen on doing it until you started raiding AQ or Naxx. Before that, the random gear that you gathered or random specs that you made were enough for everything.
---
There will always be people that min/max but as long as the game doesn't force you to do so and you can play more casually, many players will take the chill approach instead.
---
 It's like they don't remember or never experienced vanilla ghost walking and summoning to instances and having enough consumable mats for maybe two real attempts on a raid boss that your guild hadn't downed yet and all the other little things that add up and are compounded when organising 40 people who aren't all BiS.
---
I once got half way through a raid while holding a fishing pole before I noticed...as melee....thankfully nobody else noticed.
---
Azshara has Azuragos a god damn world boss, MC quintessence, a reasonable amount of quests for early 50’s. Shit ton of of herbs and rich thorium veins. There really are not any zones in vanilla that are useless except deadwind pass.
---
Lord Pythas is not the final boss of WC. Mutanus is.
---
Not really possible for this game.  You need 40 people to raid.
---
Haha thanks for that remembrance
---
Whatever happens I'm gonna have fun
---
Vanilla frost mage main btw :)
---
Its strictly pickpocket/PvP/leving build the extra points in gouge are awesome.
---
The joke is classic hunters roll on everything:
---
r/wooosh
---
Don't really know why people on this sub is so obsessed with telling other people how they should enjoy the game. Play how you want and join a guild with the same mindset as yourself. 
---
We'll also have sex. 
---
Excuse me, Hunters have melee attacks. So what about my raptor strike?
---
Yes I am aware of the joke, and am explaining why it makes no sense. Fucking whooshers are the worst.
---
I prefer to go DPS, and I’ve almost always mained a Mage, so I was starting to lean Warlock to switch things up. But honestly, it will entirely depend on who in my guild in taking. If it’s not one of our better players, no way I’m going to want to deal with DPS threat issues. I might just MT myself, but I dislike melee in general, so I’m torn. In that case, I might just end up going healer and rolling a Priest.
---
I just don't see the point in playing on a server that cuts out content and immersion. The feeling that the world is dangerous adds to the excitement.
---
Thats why I said its mostly useless.
---
I started doing undead side at level 36 and was able to solo the rare elites and unlock all of the chests. At 40 it is the easiest and you can do undead and lib all the way through and can do armory as well for the boxes. Where you can get tons of blues. At level 40 I was netting roughly 40-50g per hour. Which was insane for low levels. Plus if you are an herbalist you can grab gravemoss in undead side of sm which is also worth a decent amount later in the game.
---
I may just play a hunter for classic and just be super bro. "No way, that would work way better for your character!" and just be super under geared and not get accepted to any groups. I played hunter for a while back when warriors and such could equip a ranged weapon, and let me tell you right now it goes both ways! I lost rolls on way better main ranged weapons because the warrior wanted a good stat stick to pull mobs with.
---
I'd love to see them re-do all expansions woth vanilla philosphy. (40man raids etc.)
---
It can definitely be, my guess is that they release it on the 15th year anniversary
---
Good luck! You could run Stratholme every day from when Classic launches and you hit 60 to when the servers are getting shut down or moved to a TBC server.
---
Mount collectors who have been playing the modern game for 5+ years still don't have it yet.
---
It's one of those, the stars align, pigs fly and cats and dogs living together in harmony sorts of moments if it *does* drop **and** you win the roll!
---
With hemo you can go with whatever generally it's whatever hits the hardest or most dps.
---
1.12 is 2006.  If you're going to insult me, at least do your math right.
---
How about you let people play the game like they want to? 
---
Same. 
---
classic aint comin
---
5 mans aren't relevant for guilds.
---
I mean if you want to play what you want man I'm not your dad. But if you want an easier spot in a raid and to carry more weight play a dwarf. Because the other races of priest aren't worth it if you ask me.
---
Some of my best groups were with Shammy tanks. It's true they are not the most optimum tank, but it's doable and viable in the right hands (Although they fall off at end game content).
---
So then is your problem that other players weren't there?  That's not a content issue.  Unless you want the game to create level 50 bots for you to quest with.
---
The zones you mention are almost all high-level zones.  The problem with Felwood is that it doesn't fit into the Tanaris/Un'goro/Hinterlands/Feralas chains.  It's kind of the start of the Felwood/Winterspring chains.  Those chains involve a lot of running between Everlook, Timbermaw Hold, and Felwood, instead of a lot of fighting, which is probably why they aren't popular.
---
If you change those zones to involve less running, you've just changed two of my favorite zones to quest in.  
---
I've always seen plenty of people in some of the other zones you mention, like Un'Goro.  We'll be using the 1.12 data, so I assume Silithis will be populated (and if not, it will be when that specific content is released).
---
The other issue is that all the areas you suggested are high level zones without a connection to a raid.  There are less high level characters than low-level.  There are also reasons to go around areas which have end-game dungeon and raid content (the zones adjacent to Blackrock Mountain, the Plaguelands, Silithis, these zones contain the reputation and quest chains that pertain to the end-game content.  This is why more players are there.
---
It's not a lack of content.  It's a complex list of reasons, none of which have anything to do with the amount of content there.
---
Unless we're talking about Azshara.
---
Our goals will determine the strategy we pick. 
---
Like take me, I don't have any goals to raid or hit max level. I might hit 50s someday, maybe, but classic wow is more a way for me to blow off some steam. It's a good way to decompress after a day. Folks like you will blow past me quickly. 
---
Ehh, that depends on what type of guild you're trying to join. A more casual guild will be just happy to have another healer, but the hardcore crowd is very likely to turn you down if you ain't a dwarf. 
---
Bad loot councils can happen on any level.
---
The &lt;scrubs&gt; will probably be spared of this drama because they won't have any loot to give out!
---
Aw, he probably thought it was like retail too where he could loot.  
---
And good, fuck that guy.  I honestly hope a bunch of spoiled retail kids show up and find out what it means to actually have to get along with the people you're playing with.
---
This is the problem.  You express your opinion.  Blizzard might actually follow it.  If they do, there is a 99.99% chance the game will be worse off because of any changes made to the game from 1.12.
---
So we as a community have banded together to stamp out any such delusions.
---
Everybody thinks they're going to be a youtube star.
---
Cool! I guess there are pickpocket guides on the interwebz
---
I actually entered vanilla MC for the first time on Sunday. It was wonderful. That very first moment of stepping in and seeing a huge raid group still has the power to wow, pardon the pun. 
---
The joke is hunters roll on everything weather they need it or not. Shields, strength items, etc. there’s an entire videography on YouTube documenting this fact based joke from classic. Yet here you are, telling me the joke makes no sense because hunters wouldn’t roll on a strength sword. 🤦‍♂️ 
---
That's the beauty of how they positioned WoW Classic to us.  Since it is perpetual, you can have a main in every class eventually!
---
How much difference does race really make in min/max? I know it would depend what class and pvp/pve focus, but is the disadvantage extremely noticeable? For a horde hunter doing pve, what’s the true difference between best and worst race?
---
Another great thing was reputation mattered...servers were but but small enough that you got to know a good chunk of people.  If someone was a complete dick people figured it out and that guy got dropped from guilds and had trouble getting in pug runs for shit like UBRS or Baron even.  Sure, eventually they'll find a group but at least there is some reprucussion for bad behavior.
---
Now in retail it's just "hit the group finder button again!". And don't talk to people you'll never see again anyway.  (At least that was my experience of the 5 days I played last year when it was free for a week.)
---
I think it'll take me 6 months to hit level 60, and I'll probably never raid other than joining server pug events or something just to get a taste of it.
---
And I'm perfectly happy with that. The content loses it's meaning, thrill and wonder if it's dumbed down and spoon fed to me. If my choices are a game with content out of my reach, or a game thats dumbed down and doesn't even require me to think about what I'm doing, I'll always go with the former.
---
Too late mate the game has been tinkered with for decade now, they got most of it figured out to a science.
---
TBC is by far my favorite version of WoW but if they do decide to go ahead with other expansion legacy servers I really do hope they keep them separate this time around.
---
I was thinking about making a post like this. Everyone seems to be taking a hard stance on exactly what class they are going to main and spec and what prof they are going to do based on what is the “best” for PvP or PVE etc. Kind of sad to see. I’m going to play a warrior just bc I love playing warrior. 
---
But... to each his own. 
---
Ty! Yeah, pre tbc. And I think when blackwing was the latest raid iirc.
---
Crazy that someone could know abot the stereotype and joke, and also point out why a hunter doesn’t have a reason to roll on the strength sword. The whole point of the joke is they would roll on an item that they have no need for, and thats why its funny. Stop responding because you have no point.
---
True. As someone who’s bashed my head against multiple warrior toons and only got 1 to 60 - wait til they’re grinding basilisks and kodos in Desolace. And dying to them.
---
They might start fantasising about rolling hunter.
---
It's like people actually acknowledge that this was a thing over 10 years ago, but with all these years of playing on private servers and just the general shift in gaming being way more competitive, guides being made, these things still happen, but not on the same scale as back then.
---
I remember showing up for AQ40 without having my weapons enchanted and I got away with it. Even a 'normal' guild in either retail or Vanilla WoW, most likely won't put up with that shit. Because even 'normal' guilds these days, seem to at least have some form of rules in terms of dedication.
---
Worst of all the vultures are part of a drop quest, not a kill quest so even if you manage to tag a vulture, it won't be a guaranteed drop anyway.
---
The WoW version of Thoros, the drunken Red Priest from GoT.
---
This would get into the realm of re-itemization and changing classic in a much bigger way. The only way to successfully implement things like this so the no changes crew wouldn't freak out would be to have them after Naxx. Putting anything in the game thats pre-60 or just pre-naxx in general will change how all of the tier 1-2.5 raids were done. Items would be different, different BIS lists, easier bosses because of better items and things like that. 
---
I’d say I put in over 250 solo runs back in BC and I got it. But I was an obsessed and sad teenager. I consider it a character-building experience. The entire thing was memorized; it became therapeutic. 
---
I thought about it, but after some consideration I decided to stick with one main character. It's much harder to achieve gear and benchmark points in retail, so I figured it is better if I just have one solid main. But each to their own.
---
But you're failing to see the point that its a +14 year old game, that its pretty easy, its made for people that have NEVER played a MMORPG in their fucking lives.   
---
Yes, its a really amazing game that you can tryhard to the point of being really efficient etc etc, i've been playing private servers for years dont worry and i know how many fucking flask and shit is there....  
---
BUT, shit is easy anyways, there's gonna be even Dire Maul on release which has pretty insane gear sooo, i dont think there will be an issue with guild &lt;casual&gt; vs &lt;tryhard&gt; until AQ or Naxx, then ofc there's a huge gap because you need a lot of time investment for that.  
---
BUT in any case, old af game, i wonder how good will mythic raiders do but probably pretty easy for them even without all those flasks
---
Wow, priest is super low on the scale. What do you mean you don’t love squishy cloth leveling? 
---
Blessing of Protection disables Melee attacks only Casting is just fine so go nuts but after the buff is off you regain all the threat you had beforehand.
---
ah, the "shadowmelded night elf priest waiting to throw you off with mind control" bridge! a true spectacle.
---
Spam max rank regrowth? No, that would waste the hot portion of the spell - just cast max rank at relative-ish intervals. It's a high upfront heal, the hot  is obviously great, and combined with rolling rejuvs the hots can be consumed with swiftmend. I don't downrank rejuvenation, maybe some do, but by the time I rejuvenation + swiftmend I could likely get off a lesser rank healing touch.
---
&gt;   I'd rather have fun failing with people I like than progress in a  guild that feels like a job, and there are plenty of people who feel the  same as me. 
---
That's the thing, though. A lot of people talk like the people playing hardcore do it as a job. To them, being the best and having a competitive drive, WHILE also loving the game can absolutely be a thing. I know you spoke for yourself on this, but I feel like it's important to note that the average hardcore player still love the game and absolutely don't feel like it's a job.
---
This is exactly what I hope happens. It sounds perfect to me.
---
&gt; You also had a passive perma-taunt for the enemy faction.
---
This I can agree with. I actually class myself as a gnome-racist. I actually hate them. It's my main turn off about playing on Alliance and when I do play horde, I will do everything in my power to kill the gnome over any other player/race.
---
Thats the fcking point!   
---
If a Druid pulled that on me I would hearth right the fuck out.  You're an innervate bot in raids, **not** a heal bot.
---
I was thinking to use low rank rejuv to throw on party members who aren’t getting blasted and to save mana. 
---
Perhaps this is more important in 5 man raids. I’m not sure what low rank to use tho 
---
As long as you don't want to raid and the thing you love the most is wPvP. Then I guess you are gtg.
---
Just be sure your other 4 friends are in the same boat.
---
Here's a fucking shocker. Just about EVERYONE rolled on shit they couldn't use because nobody knew what the fuck they were doing for a few months.
---
They are we aren't going to do it for the first time.
---
You can switch weapons mid-combat, so you can put on your strength weapon once someone is in melee range to whack them with. Warriors don't use two handed weapons in PvE, so it's no issue for hunters to roll on them :)
---
I will actually play the exact same classes. I will simply just level up my shaman first with my friends on launch and then pump up the rogue and use it to have fun in PvP as soon as I'm pre-raid BiS.
---
There's really no tips other than places your alt in a rested area while playing on the other character like you said.
---
Human ret paladin, I am fully aware of why ret is in classic but I can't wait!
---
Hi, im russian :) and i was thinking of rolling an alt on german or eng server to improve english skills. Main would be on rus region with my guild anyway.
---
If you decide to roll an alt on rus server - add me to friends, mb i'd help a little bit :)
---
effectively and perfectly/efficiently are different things.  You can be effective and not min max the fuck out of it.  You can be effective without consumables.  You can be effective with a shadow priest and enh shaman.  Effective means you can get it done.  That's all it means.
---
"Play what you are going to like, play the game for the enjoyment."
---
Ok, I'll do me, you do you.
---
Theres just different levels of min/max really. I goof around more than i take it seriously but any expansion I've raided I was a competent member for mythic raiding, and not failing
---
I'll always remember the old art of a party inexplicably fighting a red dragon in STV.
---
Gear has been figured out but you will still grind consumables in classic. 
---
Who could forget the velco that opened up to that goblin in the mech in deadmines.
---
&gt; Some people love Vanilla, some love TBC, some WotLK or Cata, some MoP or WoD, and some others Legion or BfA. Why can't everyone have their own slice of the cake?
---
Because you'll scatter your playerbase over too many different options, reducing the viability of each individual one. There's no way they could ever support having each and every expansion exist at once.
---
Those bastard Warriors rolling on my Scholomance bow.
---
I think a lot of people like the idea of character transfers to new content. It keeps the OG servers alive for you to continue on other characters, while allowing you to move on as well.
---
Hey Josh. Thanks for all the entertainment. I’ve been listen to the Sinnerfiles and it’s great. Only issue i don’t understand how you and you’re entire crew enjoyed The Last Jedi. That movie was by far the worst movie I’ve ever sat threw and I was a big Star Wars fan. Lol 
---
&gt;I'm going to try and maximize the rested XP by alternating between the two 
---
Doesn't really work.  Rested XP is very slow to accumulate in Vanilla.
---
&gt;Anyone else planning on doing something similar? 
---
After doing some testing on a server, I'm planning on the same combo I did in Vanilla: Hunter/Warrior.
---
Hunter for farming, PvP and early raids.  Warrior for 5 man tanking/DPS later raids.  I'll level the hunter first so I can smooth the way for the warrior with a bit of gold for weapons/enchants.
---
My only real regret from Vanilla was not taking a shot at MTing.  I was an outstanding 5 man tank. I keyed around 50 guildies up for Ony with LBRS runs and was well known for running superfast minimal CC dungeon blitzes. However, the MT and OT for my guild never missed a night so there was never any demand for another tank. I liked my guild way too much to jump ship just to MT.  I might give that a go if I have the time.
---
Higher tier raids were done with the math of minmaxing so you need it to get shit done. 
---
My buddies and I are doing the same thing, but for a slightly different reason. We're going to have one group character that we'll all play together, and then another character for when no friends are on.
---
He holds the last gem 
---
Whats the least amount of people needed at 60 you think?
---
Welp, seeing as it's not really a lvl 60 instance I thought it might be xD. It was easy clearing it at lvl 70 in the TBC days.
---
It was barely doable at level 70 for some classes (like hunter). At level 60 I cant see any class being able to do it, except maybe a fully Decked out protpala with thunderfury and every world buff imaginable.
---
from one the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;youtube vanilla content creator&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
I'm set on deciding between two classes. Mage or warlock. I mained an undead warlock vanilla-wotlk back in the day and loved the class. I never really did any raiding though in vanilla because TBC came out right as I reached the level cap. I enjoyed warlock a lot but I want to try something new. I definitely enjoy casters a lot so I think mage would be really enjoyable since they seem to be more focused on direct damage vs. DoTs and having a pet. What are some opinions you all have on raiding and end game content for either class? Definitely plan on focusing pve and raiding this time since I never got to do it before 
---
That's a very good idea.  I've done more than a few attempts at leveling with friends and someone always gets out sync with the group.
---
It wasn't particularly hard with my warrior at lvl 70 back in the day, just very time consuming.
---
Serious question : I have been considering maining Rogue come launch, but I know how cancer it is attempting to get rogue pre-raid BiS. Is it that big of an issue where I should reconsider? Example : Getting the devilsaur set. 
---
Many people have already addressed this concern and agree with you.  The preferred method of new gear is to have it be in the T2-2.5 range.  It would ideally be gear that fills in itemization holes or has different stat distributions than existing equipment.  Adding new trinkets, consumables, recipes, and mounts would be an option too.
---
Nope, not a fan of alts, I will make do with my one warrior xd.
---
I plan on playing Paladin as I want to, no matter what other people think. Vanilla isn’t a hard game to play by today’s Standards. I don’t care about simulations or “memespecs”. Back in the day they weren’t memespecs and people just played what they wanted. I plan to keep my own play style just as I did in Vanilla, if not a little more hardcore, but encourage everyone else to do the same. Play what you want, be who or what you want to be.
---
I personally advocate for content post Nax. From what I’ve seen the demand isn’t there for TBC, but if Classic is a success, and I think it will be, there will be a demand for more of it and I’d like us to explore what that means.
---
Hopefully they’ll do a voting based system like OSRS and go from there, but we’ll see, I’m open to suggestions. 
---
I still have my physical copy of vanilla. The fact that the dwarf’s name doesn’t start with a capital letter pissed me off 10 years ago (when I started), and it still pisses me off. 
---
Rogue below Shaman? Bullllllllshit. 
---
&gt;Mount collectors who have been playing the modern game for 5+ years still don't have it yet.
---
That's not true. The mount was changed to have a 1% drop rate in Wrath of the Lich King. Farming it these days is really simple.
---
Having recently gone through naxx. What we realized is that off tanks cannot just smack with nightfall for most pulls that they actually need to tank, the shield is required (MC its probably fine). Also, it is more common to have DPS warriors with OT gear and swap into it when necessary, you rarely have true dedicated OT players so you actually waste more DPS with your method of having dedicated OT who nightfall instead of dps warriors who OT when needed. Having a hunter spam wing clip is boring, sure, but we had one and the consistency is worth it. With warriors being such good DPS its hard to say its worth having 2 just sit in tank gear and smack vs 1 hunter (whose dps will already be low) managing it themself. Also, nightfall is not cheap to make, even with a gbank behind you. You can say put it on the tanks but thats a lot of gold when you could have just one. 
---
Ah, that is true, thanks for pointing it out.  
---
Fixed it in the comment above.
---
Loch Modan is an amazing zone, what are you on about?
---
Again?
---
Lol memes
---
all good thats exactly what i was looking for haha
---
&gt; You will never ever use Regrowth. Ever.
---
Hey don't lie, you cast it on the MT right before the pull for the HOT and then drink.
---
I forgot what server I used to be on until I saw this, it was Laughing Skull!
---
Rogue is highest there and lowest here
---
Stop having wrong fun 😡
---
go back to retail 
---
&gt;I lost rolls on way better main ranged weapons because the warrior wanted a good stat stick to pull mobs with.
---
Says more about your understanding of Hunters. Your best preraid weapon is the quest weapon for winning Alterac Valley. The only upgrades after that are either the epic bow from the Leaf quest in MC, Rank14, or raid drops with ranged attack power.
---
If you roll need on any other weapons over warriors/rogues you should rethink your choices.
---
For most of us, it was our first raid ever.  You zone in and there is 30+ other level 60s in there.. mages handing out water, warlocks handing out health stones, buffs going out... raid leader comes on and says we're going to pull soon.  First pull you all wipe on the giants.  Nobody is prepared, everyone has green gear on and you all die because we don't know how to play.  You do your first of what will become thousands of corpse runs back to the instance.  You slowy get better and clear to lucifron for the first time and you wipe and the giants have respawned.. some people leave the raid some people gquit.. you're just sitting there fascinated and figuring out how we can get stronger to get that damn lucifron down!  The experience was very entrancing to be honest.
---
You have a hard time reaching the elfform blue dragon in Winterspring for Ony attunement as a gnome. It's still possible to get to her without going through the cave but you won't find a video of it on youtube.
---
No one liked Dishonorable Kills.  It's basically the only thing I don't want back in classic wow.  I hoping blizzard will release a hardcore PvP server that's more relaxed about things like dishonorable kills and get rid of areas where you can't be ganked.
---
You are missing my point though.
---
Maybe we'll struggle, maybe we won't.  I don't care one way or the other, clearing content isn't something that matters to me.  Shooting the shit with friends in Discord for a couple hours each week is what I care about.  Raiding is just kind of a vehicle for that, and provides common ground on which to found our conversation.
---
fear ward is the be-all and end-all
---
Being able to tank or heal instances really helps with gearing.  Just let people know what you'll be rolling on ahead of time.
---
I'm kinda the same.
---
I really want to play rogue or pally.
---
But no matter how hard I try, it's always the warrior that gets levelled.
---
That's not having 2 mains that's having 2 alts and no mains!  Just kidding but if you aren't in any rush to get to 60 then there's nothing wrong with it!  
---
That's fair.  What I meant by treating it like a job is that if I only want to spend 2 hours in a given week playing, that needs to be okay.  If I want to spend 40 hours in a week playing, that needs to be okay, too.  If I want to take 2 weeks off from playing entirely because some other game has my attention, that's okay, too.
---
I want a guild full of fun people, and maybe we raid sometimes.  But no commitment.  And if that means we eventually abandon raiding altogether, that's okay, too!
---
Hit is a non factor for max level Mage AoE farming. You get 6% from talents which essentially “caps” you against any mobs up to +2 level from yours. You’ll always have 1% chance to miss with spells, though.
---
Great! I'll go ahead and minmax then.
---
You bet your ass I'm taking my sweet time on an RP server. 
---
&gt;so that every class is viable, and each class has various talent builds to suit different play styles
---
But they are, and they do.
---
Loch Modan is comfy
---
What is the name of this subreddit? Classicwow. Which expansion is 3.0? Wrath of the Lich King. Your argument got demolished, so you bring up something that has absolutely no relevance as your counterpoint.
---
What an impressive display of complete lack of intelligence.
---
They have said they are committed to bringing us as authentic experience as possible. So... we take that as no major changes. However that's all we have. 
---
All classes are viable. Not all specs are optimal for raiding. All specs have places they excel. 
---
There has been no real information since blizzcon.  They also will not be changing classes or talents or bosses.  You can pick your mains now knowing exactly what they will be like and what the boss and pvp mechanics will be like to aid in your choice.
---
That's great work. I like that it's tweakable.
---
Hi, /u/BenV94
---
True, but he uses clutch of foresight to counter spells in the warlock duel. 99.999% of players aren't farming all kinds of weird world consumables to win duels
---
All it means is that using shadowmeld on someone who has you as their target will remove you from their target. It's very useful if you have an incoming polymorph or something similar.
---
I have no idea how anyone can somehow intepret that to mean break combat, when the word combat was never used.
---
Where do guilds get their pre-raid BiS? 
---
Pugs? 
---
Or guild runs of UBRS, LBRS, BRD, DM N/W/E and Tributes, scholomance and Stratholm?
---
It'll be the 1.12 patch talent, skills and balancing.
---
So no, not all specs will be optimal.
---
The only information we have gotten since blizzcon is that they laid 800 people off O\_o
---
Well, sounds like you're going to have a lot of fun.
---
I hope my old wow friends decide to come back as well :)
---
All I remember from Classic is - gear up now tank.  Now get more gear and go into a dkp sink.  I had to have a bazillion consumables, all the right gear and be early.  I just want to enjoy the experience this go around. 
---
650 vs 23500 votes with different target audience (to an extent)
---
Watch CinemaWins on YouTube on the movie. There are plenty of reasons to like it (myself included) although it was far from a perfect movie for sure lol.
---
I mostly liked how "bold" it was - it took the franchise tropes and it went with different unexpected directions with it, which is very refreshing. It expanded the balance of the force and the force in general, the "grey" side of it, it was visually stunning and it did some unexpected turns - there is a big bad guy you're expecting to be the evil behind all in the next movie? Fuck that let's kill him. And similar. Although I won't defend the goat milking nor the casino storyline, nor some of the illogical things there. But Yoda was awesome for example, exactly like in the original trilogy. Nostalgia hit for sure and they managed to do it right.
---
One time when I was BWL geared 60 warrior I lost in wpvp to a level 58 frost mage.
---
Not being gnome/engineering was painful
---
Sure thing, cheers! And likewise let me know if you roll on a North American server. 
---
Yup, IF weapon dmg worked in forms I would think +5 striking would be better, but it doesn't so 25 agi is better imo
---
The lists they gave may not be perfect, but It is nice to have them as a rough guideline for all classes on one sheet.
---
You don't need a guild to run these dungeons.
---
The purpose of a classic guild (for level 60s) is to organize 40 man raids.
---
Cheers! o7
---
Vanquish on Alliance I remember.  Also Ninja Pirates From Space but then they xferred.
---
And of course, the creators of Leeroy Jenkins, Pals For Life was on Laughing Skull.
---
Lots of devs were active players and raiders, it only makes sense. Ion Hazzikostas included.
---
If there are enough people there will probably be fun guild and there is nothing wrong with people wanting to min/max.
---
If you are using wow raiding to fill a social void in your life then make sure you don't go with &lt;scrubs&gt;.
---
They won't last long and your friends will all abandon you
---
delusional 
---
I feel like minmaxing makes the game too easy so I won't be doing it
---
While leveling an additional 2% AP will boost a rogues DPS by about 0.7% or so, while most combat talents give at least 1% dps boost per point.
---
Sure, but that wasn't the point I was trying to raise; rather, the fact that even hardcore guilds like the one featured in that run have no qualms taking non-minmaxed race/class combos such as a night elf priest into their raids as long as the person behind the character is a quality player.
---
On a tangent, one of their streaming warriors in that run is a night elf, even though melee dps is where you'd expect the strongest bias for minmaxed race choice due to how OP human weapon specialization racials are.
---
No, it is not “easy” to solo at level 70
---
Wouldn't be surprised if bliz increased the droprate ... because you know everybody should get a fair chance at it, even when you can only play for 2 hours a week. Participation medal. Or even better, why not make it an item you can buy? It doesnt effect the gameplay, so what's the difference.
---
For casual guilds this is why, but hardcore guilds want them as well for being able to fear ward your rogues so they get to dps instead of being feared. This can easily be 5 more dps getting an extra 10-30s of uptime on a boss.
---
I agree you don’t need to be a dwarf and should play what you prefer, but don’t imply the only reason people want dwarf priests is because of being bad.
---
This is the content I subbed for
---
I goof off in raids all the time.  That doesn't mean I want to bring 2 boomkins, 3 ret pallies, 6 hunters, and 2 shadow priests to a 40 man raid where everyone is doing trash debuffs on the target
---
Some of the most fun I ever had with my private server guild was when there was 2 enemy faction guilds that raided the same content at us at the same times. Every week, we would fight for control of DM North entrance for buffs, then ZG island, then sometimes even at the raid entrance itself.
---
They started getting organized and ganging up on us. It culminated in some massive battles inside BRM entrance and at AQ40 steps. A+ good times.
---
Also, I rarely killed low level players except for when they were trying to do a quest for Elemental Earth/Air/Fire that I needed for my raid consumes. If I weren't on a PvP server it would have made farming that stuff take twice as long, as there was always some lowbie there that would have been fighting me for spawns. Sorry buddy, go quest somewhere else for an hour.
---
Banana Boys, VOID were both horde.

---
Well you're basically confirming what he says since you "loved it back in the day" and have fun (nostalgic) memories about it, that's why you (primarily) like it. That said, there is nothing wrong about that. Being nostalgic about something is a valid reason why to like it. Why the f would it not? That's why I hate the "nostalgia goggles" argument. I have them, so what. Fight me.
---
(Apart of vanilla and things like MC having an actual merit so it's never just the nostalgia, but even if it was... eh, you get me)
---
Or those people that roll undead warriors just because they really want Alliance warlocks to suffer.
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply, appreciate it.
---
He has Tree of life form on his bars, so must be TBC prepatch.
---
Resto druids are very capable on an individual basis but they have a stacking problem, and other classes have faster heals and often snipe them.
---
General rules of healing as a druid.  You should be assigned at least one tank (sometimes 2) and it’s your job to keep as close to 100% uptime on max rank rejuvenate as possible.  It’s also your job to keep a close eye on that tank with your oh shit buttons (swiftmend/nature’s swiftness) to save him from big burst.  Regrowth is your fastest heal so it’s a decent oh shit button with some backside hot that’s nice for sustain.  However it will chew through your mana.
---
The best spec for a single druid in a raid is to beef up rejuvenate and plus healing so you can roll hots on tanks.  Since this requires relatively deep Resto, it’s better to go swiftmend and have more emergency burst.  If you are a 3rd string or lower druid it’s better to spec full on Healing touch and spam downranked HT (rank depends on +healing, but generally 4).
---
Contrary to popular belief due to changes from later expansions, druids are not good raid healers.  The only fight where a druid will destroy meters with raid healing is Vael due to regrowth spam.  You can’t do that without infinite mana.  It’s best to just let the epeen touting Paladins spam FoL on the raid.
---
The Druid’s strength comes from their ability to react to damage with instant healing whereas most classes just precast and hope they time the heal right.  We do that too but we can split second change to a NS+HT if we know we won’t make it in time.
---
check out the manual.   i believe there's a character named "LittleLina" or something like that with a capital letter mid-word.  
---
Awesome! Thanks so much for the feedback 😊
---
I agree with you. Those types actually annoy me and frankly I don't want to guild/group with them as they tend to take everything, even a pug dungeon run way too seriously and as an opportunity to show off how awesome they are.
---
MC will be cleared the very first day a guild is 60 and has the bare min gear to do it. AQ, day 1. ZG, day 1. and so on.
---
It's exactly like that on private vanilla servers. Players have had 15 years to perfect how to level and gear the fastest. There's no challenge for them anymore and it's all about racing. 
---
To each their own etc, but in some ways these people ruin the game.
---
The game was not designed so that a person could level to 60 in 4 days /played. This did not exist in retail vanilla and it's entirely not Blizz-like. These people have access to all the high end crafting mats and tilt the AH economy (Devilsaur leather anyone?) not to mention the ability to goto the lower level zones and grief the normal levelers for luls. 
---
To each their own etc, but once classic comes I plan on taking my time and will try to go at it like I did in retail vanilla, basically meaning I will pretend to have no idea what I'm doing. Although I'm much much more familiar with vanilla as a whole I have zero plans on trying to BiS or other such elitist crap. 
---
I do think TBC added concepts that began eroding the world's feel though. Replacing nearly all of your epics by 65 was rough, the power jump between 60/70 was massive. The introduction of dailies caused massive inflation, and flying made the entire world much smaller and safer. The change from 20/40mans to 10/25 mans also shattered so many of the successful 40 man guilds. I enjoyed TBC but looking back, I see the creeping decline looking back. Wrath's into of the LFG I think is what was the final nail but I see the starting trends in TBC.
---
&gt; ignores pvp entirely
---
Ok then
---
Thanks for the run down. Yea honestly I’m only looking at Resto Druid for PvP healing (yes I know others are better but the flexibility and self supporting kit of Druid is very very appealing) 
---
I don’t give a shit I suck at healing, I’m still needed and high in demand so give me epics:)
---
5 or 6 of the better raiders leave scrubs and the guild collapses. It's that easy.
---
I’ve watched that. There are tons of “great” aspects to anything in life. Failures and success. This movie was poorly written and of all the good reviews on youtube I’ve watch. They all do the same thing, write the script for Rian. 
---
Just because you say things that would be cool in a comment box doesn’t mean they are actually cool when executed. The Last Jedi takes terrible characters and forces them into a plot that doesn’t make sense to tell a story no one cares to hear. 
---
Yup. I will maining a druid and plan on building 3 gear sets. Bear, cat, and resto. When I go into a dungeon I will say what role I will be rolling on gear wise. Since I will be tanking, If I plan on getting healing gear I will make it known to the healer and the group that is what I plan on doing
---
If you don't intend to minmax and do the fastest clear runs then you should roll whichever race you like. Dwarf Priest racials are just for those who wanna be very competitive regarding pvp or pve but there is literally no need to go Dwarf if you don't like it. Don't listen to those who tell you that dwarf priest is the only option, thats bullshit.
---
Good job completely twisting what I said. Get out of here. 
---
I'm pretty sick of the "how-to" guides for every niche thing that keep popping up in this sub. If I wanted the game handed to me, I'd play retail.
---
Let people discover Azeroth.
---
I would imagine you could pull it off with 2 people if you abuse kiting and LoS, and most importantly: time.
---
But if you have retarded warriors it is nice to have dwarf priests.
---
Could you tell me what issues you are having so I can fix them?
---
TBC.
---
&gt; WoW Classic actually had broken OP healing addons that would basically heal for you and all you had to do was click a single button
---
The addon (healbot) won't start casting any heals until a target actually takes damage. Then it will cast the most efficient heal to bring the target to exactly full hp in 1 cast, factoring in your +healing. So for mana efficiency in a single healer in a relatively low DPS 5 man group it's pretty good. Or for multiboxing since you just need to mash 1 button on the healer without thinking.
---
In raids it completely falls apart. It will never pre-heal or overheal so you can't predict incoming spike damage. And all copies of healbot in the raid always target healed the same person. We had a few people run healbot in lazy MC raids and their effective healing was AWFUL compared to the people paying attention and pre-healing the correct targets. The healbot players were doing 90% overheal
---
Fun story time.
---
In my boredom in early on TBC before my group all quit, as a Tauren Druid I always wanted this mount (Or more accurately, just the undead skeletal warhorse)  Tauren's were able to ride Raptors in TBC, but still couldn't ride the warhorses in Vanilla or TBC.
---
Two things had changed from Vanilla to TBC... 
---
One being the obvious power creep of being level 70 and with exceptionally good Feral Bear Tanking Gear (I offtanked Most of Karazhan for my guild on US Magtheridon PvP and that one Giant Ogre boss instance) and Arena Gear, I was able to solo Baron as a feral with only 1 or two potions per run.
---
The second was the drop rate changed from like ~0.02% (like 1-5000) to ~0.1% ( 1-1000) drop rate.
---
So between being able to stealth run and kill the prior bosses of Undead Strath and also able to solo baron himself, over a two month period of running ~5-10 per day, I was able to farm the Baron Mount on my Tauren Drooood.  Selling the boss drop gear to vendors also proved to be really *really* profitable.  The runs took about 25 minutes, ea.
---
However, this time around for classic I plan on doing the more sane solution and I'm instead just rolling an Orc Shaman as my main and planned out a UC rep leveling route to just buy the purple skeletal warhorse instead.  I ain't got that much free time anymore to farm some of these more insane items.
---
Just be careful hunters counter you, especially if they are 7 levels below you.
---
Your last sentence made me giggle
---
"...makes current wow a chore."
---
WoW forums since start have always had people complaining about the game feeling like a chore or work. That's because it (and everything) is at some point.
---
I teach music in middle school for a living and enjoy the hell out of it. It gets repetitive at times, but i hardly ever get bored. It might happen in the future. Practising for myself with a band or playing in front of an audience however does feel like a chore nowadays, with occasional awesome moments. The rush i got from this used to be the very feeling that got me motivated to where i am right now, and is still something that drives me in my profession. I generally prefer not to as often anymore though.
---
Ultimately this comes down to the way you personally get enjoyment out of things and how fast you burn out on that. If the result of hard boring work is worth the while, then by all means, the chore is fun. I'd argue that the thing that kills WoW was the removal of tedious chores, only to leave rewards feeling worthless.
---
This is what kept people in the game so long, and some still.
---
That only happens when you don't have a good leadership and/or clear goals.
---
Hello fellow Drood in TBC, I think I got mine after about 500 runs.
---
I was lucky.
---
Only as level 70 and only some classes, like a very well geared Feral druid with arena or exceptional bear tanking gear.
---
Oh yeah, let me just laser focus on only BIS gear and completely ignore any upgrades that I may get along the way. 
---
&gt;Ignores, pre-raid game entirely.
---
Why not just buy a lvl 60, then If classic is just guilds running 40-man raids?
---
Why don’t our characters just start at level 60?
---
What’s the point of having guilds before raid-tier progression?
---
Shouldn’t we make guilds available only to lvl 60 character who are attuned to Molten Core? 
---
All fair my dude. There are some parts of lvl 50-60 dungeons which can be soloed, but most often only through kiting mechanics. 
---
&gt; Personally I'd enjoy to some changes so that every class is viable 
---
Every class is viable
---
Not every build is optimal    
---
&gt;and each class has various talent builds to suit different play styles.    
---
this is already true.    
---
&gt;I would also like to see some dungeon and raid bosses changed, only reason is I've played on countless vanilla and burning crusade private servers and I would enjoy to see the old bosses with new tricks.    
---
Retail awaits you--seriously.
---
Regrowth is used in leveling and in tanking pre-pull when you Reg-Reju yourself and it does decent aoe threat.
---
In a raid scenario you will rarely if ever be in a situation where Regrowth is used. The only exception is against Vael
---
The "Moonglow" spec, which picks up the Balance Talent, Moonglow, will not even put any points into Imp. Regrowth. This talent build is used in dungeons and some, early raids. Although, it is perfectly fine for later content.
---
The "Deep Resto" build, does pick up Imp Regrowth, thus you *could* use it, but at that point you are doing AQ40 and Naxx. You have more mana to work with, as does everyone else.
---
Rank 10/11 of Healing Touch is only used in extreme cases + if you use Nature Swiftness. You use Rejuv on MT, and you use rank 3 and rank 4 of Healing Touch, depending on how much HP is missing from the target, if its less than 1k HP, you use rank 3, if its more than 1k HP you use rank 4.
---
I'm still IRL friends with people I met in that guild 10 or 11 years ago.  And I see 4 or 5 of them every Tuesday and Thursday night for D&amp;D and movie night.
---
I love the no defense stance or berserking. 
---
They seem kind of bad on paper in Theory, but in the game they are amazing, if you can live without being the top dog on the Damage or Healing Meters in Raids.
---
And with people raiding 2-3 nights only in a an entire week I find this more and more to be an absurdly weak argument against the Class.
---
80% of the time you will not spend raiding in WoW Classic. You farm Dungeons, you farm Mats, you farm Reputation, you farm honor. Druids excel in those.
---
So yeah, people who choose a class, based on one tiny bit of vanilla, will screw themselves by Theorycrafting in a vacuum.
---
Most of these mouseover healing addons just reduce the number of buttons you have to press from 2 -&gt; 1. The raid frames allow you to present health bar information in whatever format you choose. That's it.
---
Buy low, sell high. 
---
Or do you expect people give away their gold making techniques?
---
The problem there is at 60, you have to do the ENTIRE instance. It would just take too long.
---
A 70 feral could effectively just stealth run to just the bosses, cutting the run time down to a fraction.
---
Well it's not a "list". It's just 1-2 Items per Slot, which are easily obtainable, no matter if you Tank or Heal as a Druid.
---
I can show the  Items I was thinking about, but I will not write why, because then you would have a Wall of Text to go through.
---
MC is actually pretty shit tbh. BWL is way more fun if you like to push DPS numbers, and then in AQ+Naxx things actually start to get interesting.
---
This makes me want to roll a Shaman.  I was originally going to roll a human warrior on alliance so I could tank and at least get dungeon groups if I don't have time to raid.  But, the fact that a warrior is so vulnerable in world pvp makes me second guess it.  Shaman, on the other hand, seem to be able to hold their own in just about anything.  Plus, being an elemental caster who can heal and also deal melee damage sounds like a lot of fun playstyles in one character.  
---
I am a little reluctant to go horde though, I really enjoy the alliance zones and cities that I have seen, and horde just seems a little bland.  
---
Which would you choose between Warrior and Shaman? 
---
&lt;scrubs&gt; doesn’t end up with 5 piece tier 3 and 4-5 tanks with thunder fury. The gear is abolustley nowhere near the same. Anyone can do MC / BWL but getting the really good stuff is hard. I’d rather be casual myself, but it’s not true what your saying 
---
&gt; and you should have completed all the quests
---
Not even close
---
Battle rez is very nice to have, of course. It's not always your MT that dies either. Could be another healer, your best DPS, offtank etc.
---
More Druids than Rogues? I don't think so guys.
---
Weapon is an exception. 
---
Literally in the exact same situation 
---
Anything is possible, but I've seen it way too many times.
---
People who have really good info/knowledge about that are not that naive to share it, it would ruin *their* game.
---
If you're interested in learning the ropes, I suggest to have a look at /r/woweconomy, it's for retail but general knowledge and techniques are valid for every version of WoW.
---
&gt; When you wipe in a dungeon, you are doing a corpse run in most cases unless you have a Warlock who soulstones.
---
Only 1-2 dps dying on a bad pull is actually extremely common in level 60 dungeons
---
Same for me. Gonna have 1 who I lvl with a mate (hes warr, Im thinking rogue so gonna make it easier for both of us rather than solo lvling those) and then Imma go Hunt or War on my solo char.
---
Perfect enjoyment on both because its super fun to go with a mate but also a really fun &amp; different experience to do it solo aswell.
---
This is what will happen, everyone is older now, they arent just children playing for fun anymore. Take a look at old school runescape, everything is about min maxing exp earned per hour rather than strictly playing for fun. Classic wow will get very boring and lose its nostalgic appeal unless Blizzard updates it.
---
C’mon mate I was having an alright day, why do you have to infuriate me like this?
---
This is also going to vary alot by server. I really enjoy auction house play, but I will warn you to make the most of it you will need alot of gold to begin with. The first 1k gold I made in vanilla was by far the toughest. After that it got much easier because I had the cash to play with it the way I wanted to.
---
I'd choose Shaman, but I'm a little biased because I leveled two shaman during Vanilla/BC (two different servers, two separate groups of friends)
---
You need an add on that can track trends in pricing over a long period of time, around six months or so.
---
Then you can use that data to make flips on the auction house. The trick is not to just flip anything though you need to concentrate on commodities used for raiding, pvp and RP.
---
I doubt anything from retail will work natively with classic. Best just to wait and see what modders can do between beta and launch, but thank you this will help a lot.
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about, there's a ton of casual retail guilds who don't give a rats ass if you have your gear gemmed or enchanted. There's tons of people who are still bad at the game, who will stand in fire and ignore mechanics.
---
Vanilla isn't going to be any different, there's going to be a ton of casual guilds who won't care if your weapon isn't enchanted and there's going to be guilds that do. Maybe there's fewer guilds now that don't care about that kind of stuff but they're still out there.
---
&gt;Now that people know how to properly raid aka "min max" everyone will be crushing the early content
---
No they won't. If you've played a private server there are more guilds progressing slowly than guilds smashing content. Very few guilds are rallying through content.
---
But classic is built from the retail client. It's just a classic skin on retail. Retail addons should work pretty damn well without too much modification.
---
**&lt;The Tail End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me
---
Planning on 2 mains. One horde one ally, one for group play with friends, the other for solo play.
---
The best thing about subtlety while leveling is the improved stealth which makes it easier to avoid that guy who is 3-5 levels higher than you in STV
---
&gt;There's a ton of casual retail guilds who don't give a rats ass if you have your gear gemmed or enchanted. There's tons of people who are still bad at the game, who will stand in fire and ignore mechanics. Then there's the whole group of people who don't even bother with organized raids because they can do LFR.
---
My point is that in Vanilla, even hardcore guilds didn't 100% optimize shit. In 2019, even most 'casual' raiding guilds, will at least have some sort of requirement in terms of enchants and gear. 
---
&gt; Vanilla isn't going to be any different, there's going to be a ton of  casual guilds who won't care if your weapon isn't enchanted and there's  going to be guilds that do. Maybe there's fewer guilds now that don't  care about that kind of stuff but they're still out there. 
---
That was my point.
---
I've pretty much decided on shaman, but I'm torn between playing orc or tauren. I like the old tauren models but orc facials are better. 
---
Seriously. Some people get so caught up on min maxing and have all these BIS lists memorized. Maybe I don't have all this stuff memorized and I want the upgrade that just dropped. I feel like some people don't understand you can play WoW casually
---
Being a good leader is not that easy.
---
Do you have a link to that? 
---
Yeah, your point is fair. I am still deciding between night elf or a dwarf warrior lol. I always played human in the past.
---
Retail feels so different than Classic. Leveling in retail now is just a slog to cap. Just hit 16 on this pserver, and even through multiple deaths/corpse runs I am still having actual fun. I feel like I am a lowly Tauren in the world, making my way and growing.
---
A resto shaman and BiS fury with all consumables and worldbuffs and BRE would probably equate to a fresh 5 man team.
---
Other than that, I guess 2 fury and a shaman :)
---
You vastly over-estimate the bulk of wow players. A lot of people are bad at the game. Barron is easy, you get the bomb you get out of the raid. There are a lot of people who are bad at mechanics and rest assured a lot of players will be blowing up their raid and failing at other mechanics.
---
And yes there's more knowledge and the skill of the average player is probably higher, but that doesn't mean there are no more bad players, there's still a lot of them :p

---
Shaman does look like a lot of fun.  Any trouble finding dungeon groups as a shaman? One of my main reasons for rolling warrior is that I like tanking and also love the instant group finder aspect of being a tank.
---
It's almost like different groups of people can set different expectations for what works for them and for what's fun for them!
---
I never got why people can't understand that different things and different playstyles are fun for different people.
---
I would take your 5 points from feral aggression and put them into feral instinct. You'll be leveling as cat post lvl 20 so you really want the improved prowl. Most of your damage is going to come from rip, and you won't be using ferocious bite too much (except on enemies that don't bleed). Plus if you ever feel like tanking a dungeon you'll want the increased threat generation, the AP reduction of demo roar isn't as important as maintaining threat with swipe.
---
In wpvp you will be mostly fine as long as you have the element of surprise and are not facing more than one opponent. Focus on wearing your enemy down; druids have no burst until very late game.
---
After the initial cat form attack go to bear, or get in a quick moonfire if you have the opportunity, and start mauling. Hold stun for when you need to heal. Even when dealing with casters take into account that bear form increases HP and has a stun. Cat becomes viable throughout later on, with gear.
---
When fighting melee use a lot of entangling roots. Also useful against hunters in combination with Sleep on pet (they have a dead zone in vanilla;  where the enemy is too close to shoot but too far to hit).
---
If you plan on going more serious in pvp be warned that it will be challenging. You will be very hard to kill, but also fairly weak in BGs, at least until you get T0.5 or blue pvp set. This is because in BGs fights are faster and dynamic and the chances of a fair 1v1 ambush are greatly reduced.
---
Also pro-tip: t0 set as druid is pretty easy to get, you can even solo some bosses (LBRS spider for boots) by using stealth to get to them and then going bear, keeping your stun only for heals.
---
While the set is not good for feral, it is a good enough starter for most raiding guilds. Besides that once they release the quests to upgrade it to 0.5 you will get a fairly decent feral set with most pieces having str, agi and int
---
And way fewer flight paths in Vanilla than Retail has.
---
Well, not so much a main 2 main, but I am planning to level up a rogue to 60 for pick pocket runs, farming/smelting dark iron, transmuting arcanite and ganking afk's in Stormwind when solo.
---
Pretty much all my cash and resources are just going back to gear up my Shaman.  For what I plan to do with my rogue, just being in not greens and level 60 is plenty.
---
It wasn’t known back in the days of classic. There can only be 1 in each raid, but even then, it’s probably more useful just to have a rogue or warrior instead in earlier raids 
---
lmao it is definitely not an increased droprate 
---
Not particularly.  With enough side-sets of gear they can fill any role.  You can tank almost any dungeon up until BRD with a shield and decent stamina gear.  You can heal as well (albeit maybe not as efficiently as a pure heal spec) and of course DPS.
---
Watch a few videos on shaman and see if it's the right class for you.  They do take a lot of totem management to get used to.  (knowing which totem to use and when to put it down) so it does take a lot of micro-management on getting used to that aspect. (It's harder than just clicking a single aura for Paladin)  But I'd argue that makes them more versatile as well.
---
This one comment is the embodiment of all things wrong with this sub, lmao.

---
This is a much more in depth list of all druid gear and all resistance sets. 
---
I also forgot for a moment that PVP gear wont even be in the game until the "second phase" or w/e its called. 
---
Min/max is fun. Don't casual away my min/max fun.
---
\*lmao\* does this "definitely" come from a source or just your 'feeling' that actiblizz wouldn't do this.
---
BWL and its non-respawning trash made me like it way more than MC.
---
Why don't you stop worrying about how other people like playing the game? If you don't give a shit about BiS lists or optimal class compositions, play with other people that don't give a shit about BiS lists or optimal class compositions.
---
Are you really trying to tell me NOT to min/max or focus on getting shit done because you don't like that play style?
---
I prefer to think of drops as being 50%
---
You either get it or you don't, It helps me deal with the endless grinding lol
---
Ever flip in Diablo 2, or Path of Exile?
---
Same thing.  I expect a lot of players instead of leveling up a second character will heavily invest in *"World of Economicrafts"* and start selling and flipping a lot of items for cut profits.
---
Fastest way to make money after you acquire enough capital to start controlling certain item markets.  I can see Rogues especially early on that rush to 40 and start pick pocketing SM in the first days or week of Classic to start buying out a lot of common items and then price fixing items for profit.
---
I came here to say this. Most random picture ever.
---
Man this is so deep, there is just nothing more to elaborate on. Just 100% agreed.
---
i mean your only proof of the droprate being increased is ''i don't like blizzard'' so......
---
according to wowhead it's a 0.8% drop rate, which is clearly enough for all the casuals to get
---
This is what I am talking about lol. Leveling up through the game (especially casual players) are not going to be aware of where the top tier stuff is and just try to get things in dungeons. I suspect you are right when it comes to end game. But the case is the same, it stinks to lose a really nice bow to a warrior or rogue. just like other hate to lose rolls to a hunter grabbing a sword, or rolling on int gear.
---
Oh I know, I've GMed a few times and hated it every time, haha.
---
Id argue that mages are probably the best at everything. Theyre probably 1 or 2 on every list you could make for each kind of pvp.
---
In path of exile they literally banned the use of popsicle sticks lmao
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/5t303e/popsicle_stick_over_12345_for_flasks_is_not/
---
I'm sorry but that's a dumb argument. When your Best in slot before raiding weapon is from doing a simple quest, there is ZERO reason why you should not do it.
---
If you are still too lazy to do a quest and prefer using a WORSE weapon because you cannot personally be arsed to look up what gear is actually good for you then, dont get upset when people get pissed at you for taking their items.
---
&gt; I feel like some people don't understand you can play WoW casually
---
Ofcourse you can, but dont get mad when people call you for taking their gear when you could just have done a simple google search.
---
why are druids and shamans so high ranked and rogues so low? 
---
Mages are pretty boring for raiding. I still love em for pvp and farming. One of the beat class to get rich too! 
---
So few Rogues...and so many Druids.
---
"  your only proof of the droprate"
---
You can't follow a simple 2 sentence comment beginning with " Wouldn't be surprised" and can't differentiate between a statement of (perceived truth) and a statement of "Wouldn't be surprised if they ever do this".
---
Screw that If it is an upgrade for both of us we can roll for it. I'm not google searching every item that drops to see if maybe it's slightly better for another class. 
---
If you really want to blow some minds, tell them that the Night Elf flippy is client side.  Just because YOU thought you flipped, doesn't mean anyone else saw it...
---
you went on a rant about how you wouldn't be surprised if they did this. i said they didn't, and you demanded to know what my proof was for them not doing it, so i assumed you also. yknow. had an actual reason.
---
You can definitely level 5 60s in parallel faster than 5 60s serially. Took me ~12 days played time to multibox level 5 60s together and I'm not a particularly fast leveler, plus there was plenty of snafus along the way with group quest management.
---
Hate kn, aint no hinterlands 
---
You're saying most guilds will have have rules in terms of dedication like mandatory enchants, I'm saying that's not the case. There's still going to be a lot of guilds that just won't care.
---
Let's agree to disagree :) 
---
So we don't agree. Okay.
---
PVP gear wont be in the game at release, how do you know we can even do the quest? 
---
It's interesting how this art cover features more fun and connected type of content we all know Classic for, but the BC cover already goes down the Hero fighting evil path. With no mention of connect with people or fun content parts. The decline of wow started pretty fast sadly...
---
&gt;Don’t min/max all the fun away.
---
Don't tell us how to play.
---
People now call Oldschool Runescape efficiency scape as a meme because everybody sucked the fun out of the game trying to be the best. Why have fun when you can min/max? Same thing will happen to WoW Classic 
---
It's level 60 with no helmet or chest piece as well... 
---
Going for an RP server in the hopes that minmaxers avoid that sort of thing :P
---
I love hellfire peninsula in the background. It's a level of mystery we'll never know.
---
One thing that I don't like about mmos is the hurry everyone always seems to be in.
---
Like can't we just chill the fuck out for a minute? I want to explore and enjoy the scenery 
---
That it drops from a normal, spammable instance definitely helps. There are a lot of raid drops that take an hour to clear and you can only do it once a week. I've actually seen it three times. Twice on my main, once on an alt. I have yet to see the dang runeblade though. 
---
I'm going to miss it when I play classic :/
---
Isn't this also the beauty of current WoW? I raid with mostly &lt;Scrubs&gt; and it's fun.
---
A lot of spamming the same spell? 
---
I farmed for it in bc and wrath never seen it drop. My wife got it leveling her alt paladin in a regular 5 man run of it. 
---
I said I wouldn't be surprised if they did that (hypothetically) and never claimed they did. You response is: "HA they didn't! Your prove is week!" .... when I don't even have provided a proof or even claimed that my feelings about this happening would be actually what happened. This is so simple .. do you tried hard to misunderstand me to prove your point or what is it? Please tell me, no hostility from my part .. just curious.
---
Hunter and rogue 2nd and 3rd to last. This is so inaccurate. These will be the top two played classes.
---
Never noticed this. Cannot unsee...
---
If you charitably interpret what he's saying as "I hope the community isn't 90%+ min-maxers" you can see where he's coming from. As a fellow casual I have vivid visions of rolling into Blackfathom Deeps and getting screeched at by a min-maxer for doing [[something sub-optimal]]. Min-maxer representation is insanely high these days and it makes social play shitty for the rest of us
---
Depends on what you enjoy more about the game.
---
I enjoy raiding and pvping.  Min maxing means I improve in both of those areas. It also means that the players I choose to play with share the same mentality.
---
Ultimately it takes less time to clear raids which means more time to pvp or play alts. It also means less time farming gold if your guild of min maxing players are focused on clearing quickly and efficiently.
---
But if your focus is more on just enjoying the game and playing 1 character than by all means play how you want to play.
---
Having a guild for your 5 mans and pugging raids is a positive though. 
---
You keep your nostalgia,  and its subsequent "juices" away from me...
---
Yeah woah woah Loch Modan is freakin amazing
---
I still ride one to this day! Undead Rogue 
---
Still stuck between human/dwarf, and paly/priest. I like humans better, but they can't ride mechanostriders (I like my mounts), and I like priests versatility in all of their abilities for so many situations, but paladins versatility being able to tank.
---
Well I stand corrected! Nothings been delayed since 2006 lols
---
We already know AV wont be in the game at the start, which leaves Hunters to farm Carapace Spine or LBRS xbow until then. However Dire Maul WILL be in the game at the start, meaning every melee and tank want the Satyr bow, which hunter's do not want. The Satyr bow is incredibly easy to farm, and can be done with two/three people easily.
---
There is simply no overlap. I dont know why I have to explain this over and over in this reddit to a bunch of greedy hunters who want to press need on every item that says "Ranged" like it's 2005.
---
If you are too lazy to look up what gear is good for you and need on upgrades accordingly, then dont be surprised when people call you out for being a ninja.
---
There's a sort of weird culture about having fun guildss in this reddit. That or telling people how it is going to be based on their own experiences or private servers.
---
Thanks so much!  I will save and add you when Classic is out :D
---
Great advice.  I will do that!
---
It is interesting to me. At one point in history Blizzard was generally known for REALLY like development times and forever delaying games until they were perfect. I don't buy into too much of the activision influence over blizzard, but I see it strongly in that regard, the need to push out content on a pretty regular schedule done or not.
---
Apparently people dont agree with me :(
---
Omg I remember this. I took 30 min trying to do it without an epic mount watching all the other people do it around me and I couldn’t get it. They seemed to get it so easily. Didn’t realize it was because I was a gnome 
---
&gt;I'm not google searching every item that drops to see if maybe it's slightly better for another class.
---
Your own incompetence and lack of interest in learning how your class works is not an excuse to ninjaloot every other item in the game.
---
As a hunter your preraid BiS item with or without Alterac Valley is incredibly easy to farm. There is simply no excuse to be this lazy in 2019 that you cannot do a simple googlesearch of what items you should get.
---
If you still choose to steal items that are not good for you but are preraid bis for other classes however, the other players have every right to blacklist you, name and shame and generally make your time on the server as unpleasant as unpossible, and you should not be surprised if you get a bad reputation over it.
---
Same but I play a troll shaman on retail so thrown that in the mix as well. + no one plays trolls so id be a snowflake. Leaning away from orc at this point because you will be staring at that model an awful lot and it sucks if you dont like the aesthetic. 
---
You mean the party with a demon hunter? :P
---
There is a spec for resto at high levels that uses mostly down ranked regrowths. With 5 set t2 and Nature's Grace your regrowth can have 60+ % chance to crit and can get cast time down to 1.3 seconds making you the ultimate snipe healer. 
---
[Revel in the confusion of what's going on here.](https://external-preview.redd.it/HOKCPNVNQwjgaouNThOtNS7YDI9KrlP8t_KT3Ub2mcM.jpg?width=800&amp;height=418.848167539&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51a16d3d8945e2c724e6e94674861b7b7f541fbf)
---
It really bugs me how he isn't wearing a helm, cape, trinkets or a ranged weapon 
---
I don't care tbh. I play the game I want to. If 90% of the players turn out to be min/maxing and someone doesn't like it then get fucked, your problem. Sick of people telling others how to play a game.
---
You've got this backwards, because the boss fights in the early raids are so short there isn't much benefit to going Moonglow because with Innervate, Mana Pots, and Ruins you should be able to top healing meters by spamming Regrowth without going oom. Then in later raids when sustain becomes an issue you switch to Moonglow. 
---
You Sir are the sort of person that is going to drive players away from Classic.
---
I like the orc silhouette but not a big fan of green skin orcs. I play a mag'har on live atm lol. But yeah you're right, I probably just need to go with tauren since I like the model best and not worry about the racials.
---
I never said I played hunter. I've never played a hunter in my life. I am a mage / priest. I don't ninja loot and never said I did. I will however roll on any item that is an upgrade for me. I've never had a problem with anyone blacklisting me. I actually go out of my way to help people and consider myself a good community member. Maybe stop making assumptions about people. 
---
Why dont you play warrior?
---
Theyre a better version of a rogue without stealth.( for raiding dps)
---
The skillcap is very high and they are really fun to progress with since you can really feel your gear upgrading over time.
---
Oh shit! I remember this! I didn't question this back in the day though lol
---
Hey are you able to send me the Discord info please.
---
Good job! 😀 
---
Rock and stone, brother!
---
Frost oil is an alchemist made item. 
---
Might be worth considering doing every dungeon on your way to 60? You’ll get instantly grouped as a tank. Great fun and great practice. I’ll be leveling a holy/disc priest. Plan to spend a lot of time in Scarlet Monastery!
---
So much of these pictures really speak to my nostalgia for WoW and MMOs in general. The idea of exploring a huge, unknown world was so fascinating to me. Happening upon small treasures and surprises that were hidden away.
---
Though those feelings are gone for me from WoW, I still enjoy Classic's gameplay enough
---
For those of us who loved hardcore raiding, but if we're being honest do not have the real life time to play at that level anymore: which class/spec can progress the farthest in the end game with the least amount of commitment? Any role is okay.
---
3 mains. Prot paladin for AoE grinding dungeons, Ret paladin for trying to raid and a hunter just becasue it was my first main character when I started playing at 13. 
---
My plans take a kick in the ass if my friends want to play horde though!
---
Exactly my thoughts too. I'm a casual and don't want the game to turn into a min/maxing fest. Hopefully it won't. 
---
Yep I always did it for free if they brought me a portal reagent, if not i charged 20s, whatever it cost for one of the reagents. I don't need to make money off portals lol 
---
That's the biggest issue we've had playing private servers together, cause my one friend works 4 hours a day and plays on his downtime, whereas me and the other friends work 8-5. So in no time we're out of sync, and that's how we decided on this plan
---
I like the effort that went into this but I feel like Dire Maul needs to be separated as well.
---
They’re all good but I would say Dun Morogh is the worst
---
I share your thoughts too. It would be nice, but I'm not up for the job. sorry.
---
My group will be a lock (the group trio will be druid, shaman, warlock) then solo as a rogue. Though I'm debating on a warr for solo since I've never rolled one before.
---
Leveling guides, class guides, farming guides... It's all just spoilers. Just play the dam game, explore, experiment, interract. Instead of googling stuff, try to figure it out yourself or just ask a guildie.
---
I ran Strath so many times back in the vanilla days hoping to get that mount to no avail unfortunately :( 
---
But that action toolbar is what's really gives me the feels..
---
Really the only way to get 5 mans easily is have a tank. So you either need to be a druid or a warrior, and if you play a warrior you probably want a support class to level with. Getting into raids is mainly just about joining a guild, really the only easy way into a raid is either a resto shaman or a dwarf priest. It can often be harder getting a spot as a tank than a dps in a raid group.  
---
Some combo of warrior/priest/druid (or shamy/paly) would be good for sure.
---
Making serious money by flipping items on the AH is not a dabbler's activity. Anyone can get lucky finding a few fire sales and reposting them at normal cost. A dabbler though is just as likely to buy "low" without realizing that the item they're buying is actually dropping in value and they won't be able to sell for higher.
---
Truly playing the AH isn't about scanning and flipping, it's about stockpiling and liquidating. It's about knowing what goods will appreciate in value when new content arrives or as the server ages. Obvious examples: Anything related to NR spikes near the opening of AQ. Traveller's backpacks appreciate when ZG opens. Why? Mooncloth is going to bloodvine gear instead of mooncloth bags, and the demand for big bags for holding raid consumables increases at the same time.
---
It's really easy at this point to predict what people will demand and when. Just think it through and invest accordingly.
---
And your hostility is unfortunately representative. It's cool, I think better signalling is needed from the casuals. Announce it at the start of the run kinda thing
---
Agree! Updating.
---
But he is using past tense, as in if I liked it back then, it's just nostalgia. As if I didn't actually like it, I just think back on it now with my rose tinted glasses and falsely believe that I enjoyed it back then. 
---
warrior+ any healing class fills 1 and 2. Three depends on 38 other people, too many variables.
---
The main design philosophy behind Classic is that you're playing a Class, Not a spec
---
In mine (and others) opinion that's valuable and worth preserving, The homogenisation in current WoW has lead to people feeling disconnected from Characters they used to love
---
I think we need to rely on social tools to find each other. My plan is to start an explicitly anti-minmax guild out the gate and surround myself with the kinds of people I want to play with
---
2 mages will always compete for gear. Or be traded for irl treats. 
---
*Tips Fedora* 
---
Im not being hostile at all. All Im saying is that everyone should play the game the way they want to and nobody should tell anyone how to play the game. Telling people what to do an what not to do is toxic
---
That's how I did it.  
---
With the right player behind the wheels both bear and cat are super great to have about in the raid! ;)
---
It was also a human paladin on my server. The only one my server got before the rate increase.  
---
I just finished leveling an Ally after years of mostly doing Horde, and I think Horde leveling is much more straight forward. Alliance leveling requires you to go back and forth to so many different zones you spend most of your time running around. The Hinterlands was always one of my favorite zones as well. Horde can get a few levels and a prebis raiding trinket....Alliance get like 2 quests and ganked constantly. 
---
The fuck are you talking about?  Unless you're living on Hot Pockets and Mountain Dew, pooping in a sock so you can nolife your way to 60 in under a week, you aren't having any fun.
---
Ye, I know. Depending on the buffs the gear and enchants varies. I'll try to sort it out.
---
Yeah, I’m in &lt;Mediocre&gt; right now and damned if we can’t fill one of those pre-raid 5/10 mans in 30 seconds every time for whoever needs it
---
&gt; Have you tried raid healing in Vanilla?
---
I only really healed in Cata/MoP in LFR so I haven't.
---
I guess my main worry is PvP end-game since people meme about rogues, how much of it is true that a good rogue player &gt; everyone else/how do Shamans stack up to the famously good PvP classes like Rogue, Warrior, Mage?
---
Pservers are overtuned. 
---
In real vanilla it was possible to reduce raid bosses to 0 armor...
---
I didn't even know there was a wowhead classic site. Thanks for that! I will definitely update all the links in the future.
---
Dont go warriors. Unless you’re one of the good ones pretty much every class shits on them.
---
Sounds like you’d like hunters.
---
I'd say priests. They are viable in pre-raid BiS gear which you can farm on your own time with the time restrictions you mention. If you're looking for a dps class, I'd say mage or warlock. Warrior &amp; rogue spots will probably be competitive, and hunter/spriest/other utility classes will be limited to people who take it very serious. Anyone feel free to chime in if I've overlooked something, been awhile. I'd say tanking is probably out of question if you're looking to get into T2-T2.5 without a lot of time commitment.
---
Wtf did I just watch
---
&gt; Retail awaits you--seriously.
---
&gt;I'm going to enjoy classic regardless. 
---
Why are you this smug? The guy already said he's played countless Vanilla servers and will like a play Classic with changes or without. 
---
Warrior + healer best combo
---
I dragged out the bars from the raid window. I got xperl eventually.
---
He’s only level 60...
---
Waiting for someone to get beat up because of this hat
---
How come? 
---
This poll probably reached more than any repost on this sub will  https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/1095817067410976768 
---
Tbh it's mainly because leveling a warrior is a nightmare for me. Appreciate that some don't have a problem with it, but for me it seems to take an age compared to other classes
---
Defo want to do all the dungeons. It's the best part of the gene imo
---
I'm pretty sure that 1 % hit is worth more than 13 agility at that stage. I may be wrong.
---
However, arguing for T1 and T2. Stage 1 T1 is there because it's the best choice in order to get 5/8 pieces. You gain more over all than the AP lost.   
---
T2...? Imo that looks far superiour to Cadaverous?
---
This dude has Teebu's Blazing Longsword which is one of the rarest epic world drops in the game... but he doesn't have a head item, cloak, trinkets, or even a ranged weapon!
---
The shit is this shit 
---
The list is built up by the guild together. It's nothing that I personally take credit for.  
---
I am open to recieve feedback and I will update the list accordingly to form it to suit the majority, hence the community is building it. I'm only the messenger! ;)
---
doesn’t work?
---
Because someone will think it’s a Make America Great Again hat
---
OP dun goof'd the link
---
Shaman for sure. Absolutely love the class fantasy and providing some of the best support to my party and random adventurers while questing.
---
Still can't decide on race even though I've read almost every single argument on the subject.
---
You didn't miss anything. Actually it's simply me going on the assumption that they will be added in stage 3, along with the second dungeon set (tier 0.5). Adding the items would kill all reasons to go into specific raids and dungeons for some classes.
---
i am not over estimating the players. your new players who do not know the mechanics will be learning from people who know everything.  a lot of these players will be new to vanilla but have wow experience (unlike retail vanilla)
---
the "min/max" ideology will be spread to them.  its like a virus that makes people clear raids faster
---
dang, wish our heals would have been this strong for classic. 
---
i been on them for years.  you are wrong
---
Warr as solo is infuriating. Id almost recommend doing that with the gorup for that reason alone haha. Its a proud achievement in the end tho.
---
Also.. that trio, dayum. Shits gonna be fire in stv 
---
Hah! Use the wowhead wardrobe, mate! =)
---
Is there a link to that run?  
---
Hmm... My bad! Updating..
---
i didnt twist anything.  
---
What’s wrong with those hats? 
---
Unlike what others are saying, the spirit racial does not in any way make up for fear ward. Its decent, but its not nearly as impactful or meaningful or necessary as Fear Ward.   
---
That said, you will be able to find a place in some raiding guild as a human priest. But, you will likely always be the second choice to a dwarf priest.
---
pvp/ranker groups tend to be a mix of various guilds and unguilded rankers. i am not ignoring anything. 
---
you might have a small group of players form a "guild" to put some meme name above their head.
---
Wrong flair. Also source ?
---
There's simply no spots for enchancement shamans. Along with prot and ret paladins they have no stats that would help them to be a decent hybrid. I mean, an elemental shaman would at least have healing in the dmg stats to step up if a healer gets knocked out.
---
I know '~~' doesn't work in flair, but I legitimately am not sure the best way to flair this post. "News" seems a bit too formal. No shade meant because I really like Yth.
---
Source is literally a former CM.
---
Looking at this and other polls it might be an odd thing to see hunters actually not be super popular. Back in the day i know they were, but it feels like this time around is new game plus and a lot of folks are going to have researched the crap out of the game before it even comes out and the result may be that only the OP classes get rolled. Might be interesting to see.
---
The flexibility of a vanilla druid is amazing, but the mentality in Vanilla was not open to them (on my server at least), though the lack of +defense gear was a visible problem for bears at the time as well.
---
Oh I see. I didn't understand it that way, didn't even see this point of view. Thanks for pointing it out. 
---
Agreed, he's super careful about his NDA obligations, but I think this is this most he can say about the "direction" of the game.  
---
Additionally, he said he knew (but has since forgotten) a "tighter" release window for Classic than simple "Summer 2019."
---
i said the purpose of a guild is to run raids.  i didnt say the purpose of the game is only raiding.
---
i am currently rank 8 in pvp and i raid weekly.  last night i was ganking people in felwood trying to get song flower buffs before raids.
---
there are lots of things you can do in this game. if you learn how to read you would know that i said the purpose of A GUILD is to organize raids
---
well, sword spec is a 5% proc rate, so yeah that sounds about right
---
Click the title. :)
---
&gt;it's almost 4 months ago and huge progress can be made
---
Sure, but we have no information- no indication, not a shred of anything that would give an inclination that any of this progress has been made. In fact, we have the opposite, "We have nothing to share" for four months.
---
&gt;Some stuff regarding combat, do you compare to pservers etc or vanilla?
---
I compared to Vanilla and verified in videos.
---
Slow fall, broken.
---
 AOE extended range while moving, broken.
---
ALL RANGED PUSHBACK, broken.
---
Arcane Missiles line of sight, broken.
---
Health regen, broken.
---
Charge combat mechanics, broken.
---
Charge speed mechanics, broken.
---
Charge LOCATION mechanics, broken.
---
The list goes on and on and we haven't even SEEN the tough abilities- if charge is the way it is, what the fuck is gonna be up with blink?
---
We haven't seen ANY of the dungeon scripting, we haven't even seen a version that doesn't have sharding FFS.
---
Acting like there isn't a LOT of nuance and honestly minimizing how gargantuan a task it is to re-engineer vanilla from a client a decade older just seems weird. Of course we need an alpha or beta, we're kinda doomed if we don't.
---
Afaik striking did work towards bear/cat hits on the recent private scene. Not sure how it will play out in the officials.
---
I always tried to do that, but the character I made with my friends was always the one I wanted to play on the most.
---
On my current private server, weapon skill is actually nerfed compared to vanilla, so you actually have more glancing blows.
---
There are a lot of TPS items lacking, agree. Care to provide some info?? ;)
---
I'm going to roll a Druid for levelling, but at the same time I'm going to have a Druid for tanking 5-mans and a Druid for occasional raid healing.
---
Downranking is a complicated beast due to several factors.  The two that apply here are:
---
1. Spell ranks under level 20 get hit with an additional penalty (this is why HT3 and HT4 are better than HT1 and HT2).  Also, when you're out of mana, it's usually better to spirit regen than it is to throw out weak heals and reset your spirit regen timer.
---
2. Some spells react really well to downranking, while others do not.  I could be wrong, because it's been a while since I looked at it, but HT downranks particularly well.  Regrowth does not.  Rejuv does, but if you're downranking usually it's better to downrank HT.  (And you can't stack ranks of Rejuv).
---
The reason Regrowth isn't used much is because it can't be downranked.  A single regrowth is a significant amount of healing for the cast time spent on it.  There are also builds built around maximizing throughput with regrowth, but they are horribly inefficient.
---
I was referring to "get fucked" (it's hostile) and yes, I agree completely
---
I’ve done Elwynn so many times and still enjoy leveling through it, but my favourite has to be Teldrassil for sure. Not just for nostalgic reasons (my 1st char was NE), it’s just so beautiful and like others have mentioned the music is awesome. Also love the sheer variety of mobs, and who can forget the quest in the furbolg den where you had to collect 4 items. Can’t wait to relive it all on launch night. 😄
---
Are they really when we're on a backported legion client with no progressive itemization, and potentially not even progressive item addition?
---
When the movement mechanics and animations of the characters, other than the model updates, are so clearly legion?
---
When the priority of Blizzard is battle.net integration over a faithful recreation of the game?
---
People have had over a decade to learn from better players yet there's still a huge number of bad players, why do you think this is going to be any different in Classic? And bad players aren't new players, I know a lot of "Veteran" WoW players that are still bad.
---
I'd agree with this. Tanking is out of the question as you need to ensure you gear is kept up to date as much as possible. A healer on the other hand is much more forgiving commitment wise. 
---
If front shredding is a thing in classic you'll likely want to put points into imp shred.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zj0fMVsZZxxcktq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zj0fMVsZZxxcktq) Look into this Moonglow spec. It's more mana efficient for longer fights in raids. I almost never use Tranquility. Not sure if it's just my Pserver or what but it will literally stop channeling after 1 tick with my hands off the mouse/keyboard with no damage taken.   
---
You will likely need an addon like LazyPig because you can't talk to NPC, pick up items, read wanted posters, open doors, et cetra while in animal form and it becomes tedious constantly having to click out, but LP will do that for you. 
---
Yeah. Remember kids “Rogues suck”.   Leave that class to me.  
---
Oh no, it only works for 98.333333% of the game, whatever will we do?!
---
99 % it'll be horde.. ;)
---
You just want to be angry.
---
As a warrior tank, if you're my friend/guildie and you tell me you need to run something I will help you. Just make friends with your local friendly tank. We dont bite. :)
---
Aye!
---
I've never seen anyone spell troll like that before, is it a regional dialect?
---
The animations and movement mechanics are not Legion at all. The demo confirmed this, as well as the sandboxes.
---
There is an entire spec dedicated to casting regrowth primarily and it is the highest HPS spec for a resto druid. 
---
No rules in pugs!! ;)  
---
DM will actually be open on release. They've announced that.
---
Man, i had no idea what he was playing. I could swear it’s not wow because he only had only 2 bars of abilities.
---
But it is.
---
Also, cool.
---
1.0 confirmed lads.  token ret paladin for kings here btw 
---
Main reason why a hunter prefers DW is the enchants afaik. I mean, at least in some cases.
---
I am afraid I'm not fully familiar with vanilla druids, but if the front shred is anything like frontstab for rogues it won't be viable.
---
Enhancement Shaman and a priest (spec undecided)
---
There's literally no solution to this problem besides "don't join a guild with different goals than yours". Of course if you're try-harding and join a guild of drunk dads you will probably top meters and be one of the more knowledgeable players, but the drunk dads can progress at their own pace without you, and you player can join a guild of likeminded players.
---
The same problem exists in every other mmo including retail, of course people will leave if they're raiding in a guild with people who have massively different goals/skill levels/time invested.
---
you got it backwards, leveling is about 2% of the game if you play the whole life of the server.
---
it will take you about 3 weeks to get to level 60 and a vanilla server should live around 2 years.  
---
you arent very good at this
---
You think wanding turning the body of a person is vanilla?
---
You think autoing in the air will do the same?
---
All it takes is a quick strafe spam when you realize how the model turns is obviously legion and not Vanilla.
---
You say "the demo confirmed this" without pointing anything out, meanwhile the jumps ARE different. Slow fall slows jumps for christ sake.
---
Ye, same goes for rogues, I guess. Race decides it all the majority of the stages.   
---
Thanks for adding this to the thread. Would be nice to move this post up to the top, for ppl to see!
---
I feel like the loudest people in this sub hate everything. You try to strike up a discussion and you are downvoted. Wanna play enh downvoted. like streamers downvoted. 
---
I get why people may dislike streamers but they bring people to the game we want people to play so they know this was a success.
---
but 10min duration I think.
---
Sometimes I wonder if that weapon was included on the box to try and steal some of Star Wars Galaxy's thunder. "Look, we have lightsabers too!"
---
I'm not necessarily talking about gear stats, but after 1.12 numbers are translated in retail, who are they going to play out?  Are mobs going to end up with more or less hp?  Will they harder or weaker?
---
Each one impacts what "BiS" is.  As for the term "meta", thats semantics.
---
Suck a fat one all of you negative shits, have a little faith in blizz with this for once. 
---
I get that you want to be happy, but empty quips from a ex-community mananger about how much a community is going to win when the only tangible information we have indicates the EXACT opposite seems a little air headed.
---
Getting 40 people to be online at the same time, whilst ensuring everyone had everything they needed, with only chat to do it was half of it I think. Pretty cool.
---
The vanilla scene has been turned inside out and there is nothing left to exploit. The BiS lists are final. This one however is more of a guide line, as in many cases the preferred race varies the gear e.g. There's more that plays a role in the BiS gear, but not "play-style"...
---
this conversation is stupid, I'm out
---
100% agreed. To be honest though part of why I try not to pester my warrior guildie tanks too much to run stuff they dont need during prebis farming is because I know all the dark iron rep, and gear grinding they need to do. In the past I've done things like trade runs with them. "Hey I dont need anything from UBRS, but I'll heal it for you so we can try and get your Drakonian Deflector if you tank X for me".
---
Y'all neckbeard don't bother me til I'm trying to quest in Felwood and cant do several quests cos warlock mcbadass wants felcloth from the demons.
---
It's the same thing. It works in Pserver, but I wasn't sure if that was a thing unique to them. 
---
Considering that ex-CM was directly tuned in to the development process of Classic, and all you have is baseless speculation, I'd argue you are the one with the flawed mindset here.
---
Could not agree more still.
---
A tear of joy trickled down from the corner of my eye when Ythsens said: The nochanges community is gonna win more than they think that they are. Hope!
---
Is Blade of Eternal Darkness not good enough to make the BiS list?
---
Id say 50/50 against a hunter really, 
---
You guys really think they will make it an authentic experience with a modern engine? There's no way they will make every single mechanic feel like it did back in the day.
---
Smaller things like spell batching probably won't be accurate, and the meta and feel of the game will change quite drastically.
---
Hey there, you are correct we are rolling Horde NA-PvP. And thank you for pointing this out! I just realized I forgot to include that in the post, sorry for any confusion.
---
Good morning ! Sent via PM
---
Honestly, man, that's one of the tougher dungeons and I'm pretty sure that drops off the last boss. Maybe you could do it with four people if you all had T1 gear. 
---
DHK's were awful, I remember many times losing huge chunks of honor because someone during an ironforge raid decided to aoe some vendors 
---
Well, to be fair the Classic behavior could very well be different from private servers and or original Vanilla.
---
I never had issues running things for guildies even with all the stuff I was working on since alone, even with BIS I'm not going to make it over that first bridge in MC. The gearing of your guildies is just as important as your own. 
---
Amen to that. 
---
I agree completely, once they announced that they'd be using a modern engine, a lot of my hope was gone.
---
I just cannot see a scenario where they change every single little thing so that it feels just like the old client, it would be near impossible.
---
For the people who have never played vanilla, or haven't since 15 years ago, you might not notice. But for people who have played it a lot, it probably will feel and work very differently.
---
I mean, ”no item addition” literally means no change so, at least kind of? Sure the animation part sucks, i’ll give you that.
---
Besides, don’t worry. If Activision is calling the shots (and it is) and wow classic boosts revenue (and it will), then it will certainly be progression beyond vanilla. They will milk that baby dry, even if it means re-releasing BfA in 10 years.
---
Or who knows they might even give way, put a little effort in it, and create a new alternative universe expansion line. I mean shit man, movies reboot themselves all the time; even games have. An MMO never did it, yet.
---
And that also means that 10 years from now when people are sick of the game again they can release classic servers again and then re-release the original expansion line.
---
As long as it makes money, the milking will continue.
---
Don’t get me wrong, i am counting the months to Classic. Just being realistic here.
---
It's all a lie! 
---
My understanding is that is an issue with private server refresh rates which are not correct to blizzard's, and thus wont work.
---
Long way to go before launch. Right click reporting and sharding with terrible retail servers is enough to kill classic as it is. Ythisen doesn't realize how damaging to the game right click reporting is going to be when raid leaders and rankers get bans. Does he understand that non-progressive loot trivializes the game? I'm not talking the mc loot table updates, I mean the 1.12 stuff that puts bwl/aq blues into 5 mans. 
---
you do realise the entire idea of the post was: what would you do if you were IN the game, and if your character died, you would die in RL. all others would play normally
---
you really wanna engage in PvP if you life depends on it?
---
If Loot trading and sharding and right click reporting are in Classic (like we’ve been told they likely will be) then the #nochanges argument is already obsolete.
---
Those are changes.
---
No Changes died at Blizzcon yet we keep hearing about it for some reason.
---
Cue the “NO CHANGES WON!! (Except for those changes they made)” ‘victory’ cry.
---
That's very true, and it could just be my own hang ups. I've always felt bad pestering tanks for stuff
---
Yes, they will be bad but they will still raid using the "min/max" that the OP hates.
---
Nah, you're misreading that I reckon. His point, presumably, was that when someone has a rabid outbreak over stuff that isn't even remotely connected to actual gameplay they have already chosen to hate the result. The eventual actuality doesn't matter because it won't please you regardless and it's unlikely anything would.
---
I mean, ask yourself one question. Does this make you angry? If not then I'm wrong, simple as. If I'm right then you should probably take a step back and try and regain some perspective, no?
---
ok
---
Go play retail. 
---
Also, I remember my WoW instruction booklet mentioning Dishonorable Kills. So I thought they were there from the start.
---
However, I received WoW as a gift in July 2015, so maybe the booklet had been updated after 1.5
---
Perfect sense, he’s saving for a mount.
---
Sold for 3k gold on Magtheridon and the guy who bought it got viskag about a week later. 
---
I've been playing private servers since 256 funserver's were the norm....The only time I had an issue with finding a guild to progress with is when a server has been fully progressed for a while and everyone is raidlogging. That has nothing to do with people ripping through content though, just how vanilla servers will end up. Not to mention the pserver scene is toxic with everyone moving whenever there's a fresh server...
---
There will always be more guilds not try harding the content. The amount of people rushing through content will always be the minority.
---
FURY
---
We were Horde first, server second to that Alliance guild Transcended or Transcendence. I remember you Ojimbly :)  
---
Source: I was Blackulla, one of like two druids we had. I'm on the left in the yellow hood with the candelabrum I got from Thaddius. You guys used to make fun of me because I was rocking that Finkle's Lava Dredger for like 2 years.   
---
Huehue
---
Right this way to my casino.
---
druids are such unsung underdogs in vanilla. yes, raids are one thing,
---
but when it comes to questing and dungeons, druids are freaking amazing. they're often better tanks in dungeons than warriors, hold better aoe threat, can heal in a pinch, so much utility it's insane.
---
if i had to pick one single class to be with me in any scenario, and i were any random class every time, it would be druid. +1 druid is always useful no matter what your class or comp is.
---
Better than most classes. 
---
I wonder why people seem to regard him so anti-vanilla then. Does he really believe wow is better now than it was before?
---
Retail removed all the choices, and ability to truely create a build. Since everything is about endgame content, they killed leveling fun. Not talents, no need to choose what skill to buy, no need to go to weapon master. Just here's everything, now go do raids.
---
Every change is a battle that needs to be won. Just cause you won or lost one battle doesnt mean you give up on the next. 
---
God, my poor hunter was constantly getting ganked from rogues in STV!
---
Was going to post this. I had 2,000 gold before hitting lvl 40 on the pserver I started playing on some months ago. People keep asking me how and there is just no way in hell I'll ever tell anyone that easily.
---
I'm in a hardcore guild now and after *months* they're finally sharing secrets with me, shortcuts in dungeons and secret grinds that are absolutely not known in the mainstream. There are no videos and no guides that talk about these dungeon shortcuts or tricks.
---
Anyone smart enough to know these things or figure them out is smart enough to know not to share them.
---
The only exception is "content creators" who are under the impression that they have a chance to make it big on youtube, so they sell out a portion of their WoW success for a shot at making money through media.
---
u can do it because vanilla 5 mans are super easy
---
How is it baseless speculation? The little official information that we’ve heard about Classic has created huge boiling points over the past few months. Sharding and Loot Trading are the big ones, then, yes, we move to speculation on the right click reporting (based on the cost cutting measures going on and a desire not to have many GM’s involved in the game).
---
Ythisens comment is absolutely a vague, throw away, off the cuff comment, but if he is ‘trying to tell us something’ my interpretation is simply that the game is ‘more’ no changes than changes - meaning they’ve done a pretty decent job of replicating vanilla (but some things have still changed). But that’s just me. Others will take it differently, I’ve no doubt.
---
But blindly ignoring what we’ve been told by Blizzard just because you want no changes so bad, will only set yourself up for some huge disappointment if they go with what they’ve told us they plan on doing. I really feel like they’ve  stared us in the face and told us already ‘expect small changes’.
---
The fact of the matter is you're liable to be lynched for wearing one of those hats in the USA.
---
I would never wear a red hat that even remotely resembles that hat in public out of fear for my and my family's safety.
---
Not everyone know all the mechanics, especially if they never had to level a character. But, that guy sounds like he got what he got. Best way to teach someone not to be an asshole.
---
Great for 5man (esp the undead dungeon) and 10 man.
---
No, a lot of people won't. A lot of players won't use BiS lists or optimal specs. You'll have guilds and raids where people are Ret or Boomkin and the guilds will be fine with it.
---
I dont think they said it was likely.
---
Which is fine - go nuts advocating for what you want to see in the game. I’m more suggesting that, depending on what we get, if we get the changes that have been put forward, then the game won’t be ‘no changes’.
---
#\#winning
---
Yeah the extra +15 agi from having 2 enchants is really sick.
---
The problem is that this overabundance of information wasn't available back then like it is now. Classic will be a much different beast, and a lot of people will definitely min/max the shit out of it this time around. Be prepared to not get invited to any groups if you go against the norm.
---
We've been vocal on those issues since they were announced and haven't heard an update from Blizzard on them so for all we know he is referencing these things when he makes that comment.  
---
Personally I think Sharding will be in for a few days on release for the first zone or two but really hope they change their mind on loot trading.
---
Originating from a 3rd world country, my friends and I mostly learned English through videogames, or in large portion for some of us.
---
There was a core group of boys in school that spoke exceptionally well English, well above the level of even the most senior students and even some teachers in the school.
---
We all had one thing in common and that is that we played a shitload of videogames.
---
No videogame was ever localized into the rare language of our country so we had no choice but to understand the games in English.
---
Forcing yourself to use a Spanish client will absolutely increase your Spanish skills.
---
No they were listed in the manual. However the manual also listed them as killing players vastly inferior  to you in level. But that never existed. The manual had a lot of incorrect or "intended" information in it.
---
Hey thanks, I'm happy to provide our list.  
---
We've created the list to have only one item per field, mostly. The enchant chosen is more versatile than healing imo. It provides both healing and mp5 and is more useful in clearing with less down time.  
---
As for the trinkets (and many of the chosen items for each class), they are the most used ones. I mean, for each raid setup there will be "healing-healers", "mp5-healers" and "crit-healers".  Finding out which specific item that is needed for that specific role will not be done with this list.  When raiding a bit, most player find themselves with various trinkets to choose between and with some experience the right trinket will be used for the right occasion.
---
Which part? I know they haven’t officially talked about right click reporting, but on sharding and loot trading:
---
With loot trading, unless I’m taking crazy pills, and feel free to tell me I am if you’ve got the wording used, but I was sitting front row centre at Blizzcon as I was being told that Loot trading is coming to Classic?
---
With sharding, they haven’t used language that says ‘100% it’s in’ and I know they’ve explained the possible circumstances in which it might be used, but getting on stage and talking to us about it in the depth they did, why would they bother if it wasn’t ‘likely’?
---
People on this sub don't seem to understand that the PServer crowd and the official classic crowd are going to be vastly different. To be on a pserver, by its very nature you're either a serious player that cares enough to jump through the hoops to experience the content, or a freeloader that probably won't get to endgame.
---
There are no casual guilds on pservers because there are no casuals.
---
You sound like you’re enjoyable to play with.
---
No changes is a fucking joke stop embarrassing yourself. 
---
None can agree what it is and what it isn't, and the advocates for it sound about as stupid and extreme as feminazis. 
---
Loot trading, sharding and right click reporting are all automated system put in place to lower the cost of the game by using cleaver technology instead of mass GM's / server infrastructure. 
---
It's completely expected, you cannot expect the a 14 year old game to be run like it was run back 14 years ago. 
---
Looking forward to it! ;)
---
none of those things even matter.......what the hell.
---
In this experiment you would never ever go to stv. That could be part pf their findings.
---
Tell that to the majority of this sub.
---
If you are a good druid, you might have a hard time getting in raids, but you'll be king in dungeons (which especially for stage 1 give more progression than tier 1 raids).
---
Druid is the most complex class in WoW imo, very underrated.
---
My hardcore guild on pserver has some very good druids and they're as in demand as the guild warrior tanks when it comes to tanking dungeons.
---
Obtaining the Devilsaur set is rather easy afaik. 
---
I mean it's not like people are going to choose their faction based on race preference but the other way around, since there is only 1 race for druid on each faction it's just a matter of which faction you prefer playing on.
---
If we had to weigh in the NE vs Tauren druid racials, I'd say tauren pulls ahead in pvp scenarios and NE's pull ahead in pve scenarios , wisp corpse running due to wipes is in deed great for pve more than pvp, also worth noting the 5% extra stamina on tauren is great for those who decide to tank etc.
---
The Orc racials are good, but the stun is awesome. If you really like Tauren models I don't think you'll regret being Tauren.
---
Dont lie, we got killed by shamans constantly. We all know it.
---
The absolute only thing I'm willing to change for Classic is the WoW Trading Card Game mounts being sold in a real money store or otherwise be available in game as a drop, like the Turtle mount.
---
That's it.
---
I couldn't agree more on the fresh retards.
---
I was talking about this before but I guess I have to repeat.  You will have your top notch try hard guilds full of experience players but the rest will join guilds that try to min max but are newer to the game.  This is what you are probably referring to.
---
The OP sounds like someone who will be in tbe worse guild on the server full of non viable specs and no order over the raid.  Lots of trash debuffs, players without vital raid add-ons, etc.
---
Night Elf shadow priests represent!
---
It's an amazing 5man tank as it does the best aoe threat and does more dmg then druids and warriors while tanking. Single target can be a little lacking by salvation takes care of that.
---
Regardless of expansion, the following has been true all this time:
---
With warriors, it's *way* easier to get into PvE and progress quickly if you play as a tank, even if you aren't all that good at it. Whereas if you want to be a damage dealer as a warrior, you have to invest *A LOT* more time into learning the class and getting really, really good gear.
---
That said, a properly decked out DPS warrior has *always* been the absolute TOP DPS in any expansion, from Vanilla onwards.
---
For me, the easiest time of playing a warrior was tanking in Cata. Such a piece of piss and also quite fun when you almost topped ps just by spamming Revenge.
---
Rolling Fury DPS was much harder  and took a lot more effort and gear to be sustainable. 
---
But I mostly roll warrior for the sweet Mortal Strike one-shots in PvP. Nothing comes close to that in terms of pleasure. Well, maybe followed by  PoM Pyro and Cold Blood Ambush.
---
This is 100% true but people just don't get it.
---
The same "give shiny new thing" attitude that killed Vanilla in the first place.
---
Here's hoping the community doesn't kill Vanilla a second time.
---
S-priests do provide decent DPS, especially if take the 20 % shadow dmg increased debuff into consideration. Along with that they are an excellent hybrid, being able to step up as a healer if a healer should get knocked out.   
---
A priest will never be top-DPS but it's a very versatile specc and useful.
---
He had to afford it somehow.
---
Or he's just an absolute Chad and doesn't care. 
---
This is the main reason for having 2 mains.
---
Oh, you're right, I remember that description. I didn't know that never existed, I thought It was modified before I joined the game.
---
Like others have said, one for duo-level and one for solo play-.  
---
Shaman + warr duo level.   
---
Priest solo
---
insanely expensive to purchase off the AH due to the Mafia, which in some way or form be on Classic servers, and trying to compete for the Mats is going to be equally as aids. 
---
A simple fix for DHK's I'd accept is only the killing blow dealing player will receive a DHK.
---
That way some fuckwit can't ruin it for the others, though it does leave in the intentional pulling of civvies into aoe packs.
---
&gt;His point, presumably, was that when someone has a rabid outbreak over stuff that isn't even remotely connected to actual gameplay they have already chosen to hate the result. 
---
And you misread and throw interpretation over my words to your own benefit.
---
I'm angry because specific decisions have been made to save on resource costs (loot trading), to *potentially* disrupt live launches (sharding), to favor battle net integration over a faithful reproduction of the game we love (legion backport).
---
We know these things are a reality, or in the case of sharding, being at least considered.
---
No changes didn't think they would have to deal with sharding- no changes didn't think they would have to deal with loot trading- no changes didn't think they would have a backported legion client.
---
Circlejerk and downvote me all you want, but it doesn't make the things I'm angry about any light-years closer to no changes getting what it wants.
---
They never last.  People get tired of extremely long raids that are full of wipes.  
---
You want to spend 4 hours in mc and die the whole time? Of course not
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Not sure if that’s directed at me? I’m not pushing either side in that post, I’m saying that my interpretation of what’s happened is that no changes already isn’t achievable.
---
Sounds like the story of my life in quite literally every single expansion (that I've played): go several weeks/months dry of a drop, finally break down and buy/craft a replacement, nothing but that slot drops over and over week after week. 
---
ONE FUCKING MECHANIC.  IT'S A FIGHT WITH ONE FUCKING MECHANIC.  HOW HARD COULD IT POSSIBLY BE?!?  
---
*headdesk*
---
I hate twin emperors, more because it's like a microcosm of the human condition.  That and Thaddeus.  
---
Oh of course! I don't expect to do too well against ranged which is actually exciting for me because I'll be better against melee classes I'm bad against on my warlock (like warriors).
---
Yeah I’ve kind of read the vibe as this:
---
Blizzard: “We’re bringing in Sharding and Loot Trading.”
---
(Goes silent for 3 months)
---
Classic Community: “Maybe they won’t do Sharding and Loot Trading!”
---
I’m being cheeky but it’s been a bit like that. And yes I know Sharding hasn’t been ‘confirmed’ so to speak.
---
&gt;If Loot trading and sharding and right click reporting are in Classic (like we’ve been told they likely will be) then the #nochanges argument is already obsolete.
---
No changes never thought it would have to deal with these issues- and yet here we are.
---
Ysthines's comment relies on having a good read as to what "the no changes community is expecting." Without concrete details your guess is as good as mine, but what isn't a guess are the systems (sharding, loot trading, right click reporting) that Blizzard is considering which fly in the face of the EXACT movement being discussed here.
---
Undead blacksmithing warriors
---
Pally tank gets the job done in 5 man but if you don't have any int you'll be drinking after every mob pack/boss. It's super slow compared to warrior in that case. With matching gear it's very good tho.
---
I dont know a single Resto Druid who ever spammed Regrowth, in any setting bar Vael.
---
And Innervate goes to a designated Priest, not on yourself.
---
Lol patch 1.12 with progressive itemization? So a version of Vanilla that literally never existed!
---
This is the real hypocrisy of the #nochanges crowd. 
---
I been the warlock tank for it.  It's really annoying how people can screw it up
---
Cthun is more of a headache because you can't cover for the bad players
---
*looks at Esfand* you forgot Ret Pally BiS? #pepehands
---
Do you remember an alliance guild called Deus Vox? I remember they were a big one. I can't for the love of me remember what alliance guild I was in..... I remember doing MC and BWL
---
Ha. Half the fun of playing however I want (in non BiS gear) is getting to troll pricks like you after beating them in pvp. 
---
In vanilla, I bought my epic mount and a year's worth of flasks with a disenchanting alt. Nobody (on my server) bid on bad items. So I just bid on literally everything on the AH and DE'd it. There were like 2 months where I never got outbid and would wake up every morning and just shard stuff for a half hour.
---
Then I would buy out all the shards/expensive materials and then repost them for higher prices to try to reset people's expectations for how much stuff cost.
---
If you buy out everything at 2g and repost it for say, 5g, people will ignore the huge price hike and repost at 2g. If you post something for 5g and then post more at 4g99s and then some more at 4g98s, people think "oh, the price must be 5g".
---
True. It depends on the goals of the player though. Some players want to get to 60 and raid as quick as possible. Not get delayed by griefing. 
---
Man, I really am bad at this game. I'm hoping to be running SFK with my IRL friends by week three. Feel free to bring your geared out 60 to Tarren Mill to gank us after we clear it. 
---
Good read!
---
Will do, man! 
---
I dont join any guilds that require an out of game application form, thats how I judge if a guild is a good fit for me. Trial runs to see how i fit in? Sure why not. Trial rank for so long that limits my interactions in the guild? Yeah thats ok. Leave the game and fill out an application with a resume, references with a follow up interview? Nah mother fuck, unless it comes with salary and benefits. 
---
&gt;If &lt;Scrubs&gt;'s purpose is to chill out and have fun, it does no good to anyone to turn a whole guild upside-down just because a few individuals made the wrong choice for themselves.
---
How is it "the wrong choice?" That's dumb. 
---
It's not hypocrisy. A lot of people in nochanges want actual progressive from patch to patch.
---
I'm not in that bucket because I'm not actually nochanges, but acting like not having progressive itemization isn't FURTHER from what that movement wants isn't hypocrisy..
---
I guess they are terrified for thier jobs. 
---
You mean the hook and loop?
---
They could scrap those things when they want,but sadly it's not gonna happen....
---
It's not. 30 sec internal CD is not worth it.
---
This is why I am rolling shaman with my friend and priest (which is my fav) for solo. Roll your second favorite class for duo play
---
It is, but at the same time it's "only" gold - somethign that you can get anywhere! ;)
---
Idk but my version had a velcro patch 
---
Nice gatekeeping, I guess. A guild can do whatever they damn well please. Hell I'm in a (supposedly) pvp-explicit guild right now on a pserver (just joined yesterday though). 
---
Nice try blurring out &lt;Nope&gt;
---
I guess in the beginning it was viewed as some kind of battle between the two sides but for me it was always about getting the least changed version of Vanilla. 
---
No changes was technicaly off table from day one. Blizzard chose to make Vanilla fit in a current game client rather than make thier infrastucture able to handle the 15 year old game. 
---
Classic can still be blizz-like is what i heard in Ythisens statement. 
---
Love your show btw.
---
Torn between warrior and hunter. I love tanking but every comment I’ve read here says that you need to put more hours in than any one else in order to be a raid tank and I won’t have enaugh time to sink into the game to do so. I’ll just go hunter if I can’t tank with my warrior. As a dps, will I get enaugh loot to tank every now and then once our actual tanks are geared?
---

Unless you're in the try-hardest guild on the server, it should not matter: Fear Ward is helpful in some early and mid-tier encounters, but the further you progress, the less useful it becomes. Secondly, not every priest has to be a priest, having 5+ Fear Wards would absolute overkill. The Spirit Racial actually becomes more powerful as you get better gear, because it's based on your combined spirit, not the base stat (if p servers have it correct, that is).
---
All in all, I've never had a problem finding a raid as human priest. Dependable healers are not so easy to come by, and unless the raid is severely lacking in dorfen priests, they should not have any problem with your priest being human. Only situation where you possibly could be denied a spot is in a newly founded raiding guild that has no dorfen priests yet, but already eight priests of different races - in that case, I wager they would strongly prefer a Dwarf.
---
For having played on many different vanilla server, i can tell you it's all a question of tunning. Some MC are way easier than others. So if your experience is only from Pserver, keep it mind that it's more then possible that they have the number completely wrong and real classic will be way different.   
---
For instance, on K3, the fire elementals that spawn lil dudes have so low hp that you can dps them down before they even spawn one add. But on another server with group similarly geared, it spawned at least 2 or 3. 
---
I think they just said it was something they were looking into.  I wouldnt try to dig in to their wording to find hints.  
---
I’ve got a buddy I met in cata back in 2011. We are planing on leveling a tank/healer together. 
---
If the only data we have is 1.12, then 1.12—with all its changes to spell coefficients and stat calculations and the threat algorithm—not to mention the complete Rogue overhaul and the 1.12 state of spells and abilities, it’d be incredibly unVanilla-like to have progressive itemization. 
---
1.12 existed only with one item database. 
---
Maybe just don't go for raid tank and just dps / have fun?
---
Eh, min/max is half the fun for me in games.
---
Dude definitely, I'm getting fucking tired of it on retail. Can't wait for Classic where I play to just, you know, actually enjoy this game.
---
&gt;No changes is a fucking joke stop embarrassing yourself. 
---
Why the fuck are you being so rude Crag?
---
Wanting Blizzard to implement less changes where possible in a game that they initially dismissed and said they would never make isn't a joke.
---
&gt;Loot trading, sharding and right click reporting are all automated system put in place to lower the cost of the game by using cleaver technology instead of mass GM's / server infrastructure. 
---
That's the thing, we want a good game, not a cheap game. So people pointing out what it is that they want and you defending daddy activision for trying to cut corners it to me what is actually embarrassing. 
---
&gt;abusing it is literally ninja looting, which is something the social aspects and community takes care of.
---
Except we don't know enough about this system to actually say anyone will know if you traded it. Blizzard hasn't given us any indication that this will be different from loot trading they have had in retail clients, which would make it possible and easy to avoid anyone ever knowing that you traded it to your bud after equipping a shitty item in that slot before rolling for it.
---
Love you man, but you're really off kilter here.
---
Yep, havin a blast leveling on pserver. I figured id try retail recently gettin hyped for classic, and I hit 20 before I even noticed my mana bar move. Its just not fun, I play priest and there is no skill to it at all. On the pserver, i have to watch mana, an think about what im doin, decide if I want to buy my next skill or some gear, and where to put my talents, so much to do. Retail, its really nothing to do till your max.
---
Large and Small Radiant Shards. Thats where the money is, not Brilliant Shards, those will depreciate in value rapidly as they are some of the most common of the enchanting materials. Radiant shards are in a spot where they aren't dumb-easy to farm by a 60 and a lot of the items that are turned into them are used by people leveling.
---
TFW less rogues than druids..
---
&gt; have a little faith in blizz with this for once.
---
               
---
Faith              
---
noun           
---
1. complete trust or confidence in someone or something.               
---
Is there a word for not fucking something up a single time in a long row of fuck ups?
---
Again, people have lasted for over a decade, why would Classic be any different?
---
People do? 
---
For me it seems he is a big vanilla fan actually. The way he talked about Classic on the Blizzcon panel, as discussed in this post:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u3tjj/i_love_how_ion_reacted_when_the_presenter_guy/
---
And in general with other design decisions and talks, as I addressed in this post:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7sv7mm/end_of_class_homogenization_in_retail_wow_new/dt7offm/
---
But of course he (sadly) can't turn 180 on a lot of issues of modern WoW, as current players will immediately start complaining (for example how they complain about higher prices for server transfers, race changes, how leveling takes too long, how forcing people not to fly at first is "anti fun" etc.)
---
You get money for completing the quest?
---
These tryhard private server hero’s are gonna clear mc the second week of release anyways.
---
Buy low
---
Sell high
---
Got teebus back in wrath from getting lucky. In cat I started using it for tmog ever since
---
Butbut there is a guide on how to do it, I’ve read it 20 times why are the 39 other people in my road not doing everything perfectly the first time we try the fight ? 
---
I played vanilla wow with my brother and my cousin. I will be playing this time around with my brother, my cousin, and a few guildies. Should be a blast!
---
Oh yeah, Cthun is a fight with actual difficult mechanics that needs a lot of thought and positioning.  Twin Emperor's is one of those checks to see exactly how many idiots your raid has.  It's not a perfect idiot check fight, because the Warlocks actually have to learn new skills, but so much of it is just basics with harsh penalties for stupid.  
---
IMHO it's not the greatest idiot check fight, but it is one that revealed exactly how many fucking morons were in your group (like the mage frost bolting the magic immune emperor, because walking across the room is difficult)
---
Its the CMs trying to make themselves look needed and important in order to avoid being laid off in round 2.
---
You weren't around last year or what? People are concerned because of how Blizzard has been handling things during the last few months. Calling those them "negative shits" is just ridiculous.
---
He does not have an option to choose any talents. And it looks like there is a placeholder icon between the spellbook and quests.

Here's a raidlog of BWL of the best private server guild on the most current server (look at the healing done breakdown of the top healer)

---
A priest pre-AQ40 should not be going oom, so if they need an Innervate they are doing something wrong. 
---
Oh look another person replacing the nice and immersive stylistic UI with MS Paint rectangles. I will never understand.
---
All I enjoy doing is tanking, if it was more well known for end game back in Vanilla I would have mained a Warrior instead of a Druid. This time I will main a Warrior tank because I'm well aware of the end game scene.
---
Sure 1.12 existed with only one item database. But 1.12 also had Naxx out. Surely you don't want Naxx out on release?
---
Having everything out at one and the game in its very final state in every way is not a good way to implement a Vanilla Server. Progressive itemization is not that big a deal, a bigger deal is progressive item addition in my opinion, but itemization serves to trivialize a lot of content and gear if not progressive.
---
Will it be the end of the world if ban'thok sash has some hit on it? Of course not, but in my opinion the game will be worse off, and be further from how it was in vanilla- not in 1.12 because Vanilla isn't just 1.12.
---
I'm curious whether or not you'd like dungeon set 2 out on release? It was there in 1.12 and it would serve to replace for several classes any tier gear prior to AQ and Naxx. I think that's an extreme example, but a good one for what not thinking about the impact of gear / stats added later as catchup mechanics would do to the gear progression of the game.
---
Nice showcase! Thanks!
---
Good luck with that 
---
I learned Chinese while playing on pservers. 
---
My thought that flows on from that though is why would they even bring it up? Why present a slide on it and talk about loot trading at length if they’re just looking into it? I appreciate the vague language we’ve gotten so far but I’ve taken a ‘softening the blow’ interpretation of it.
---
Which is why the whole #nochanges crowd is stupid. 
---
You have to make changes to actually make Classic more Vanilla-like, but they refuse to understand that point. 
---
Much of this sub won't be happy unless Blizzard somehow turns back time to 2005.
---
And its an engineering material required to make things with.
---
Thanks very much, I totally hear what you’re saying and it’s a great point - perhaps the catch cry from day one should have been ‘Few Changes’ :p
---
You seem to think that its all but assured that blizz will force TBC.
---
I didn't think it was very odd as feral DPS didn't become a big thing until BC and WoTLK. I was a feral druid for over a decade and just couldn't cut it well enough in classic to raid. With that said, I was mostly pre-raid BIS and just ended up doing PvP and dungeons. Being that it was 13 or 14 years ago, I'm having trouble remembering the numbers exactly.
---
I do recall doing quite a lot of burst DPS, and then just falling off and struggling. DPS over long fights really dropped off, as I recall. I know that I raided on at least different classes at 60 and I can't ever recall having a feral druid in our raid.
---
Having trouble between Hunter or Warlock, horde side. I keep leaning towards hunter but warlock seems to have just as many benefits and better upside.
---
"No changes" more than anything was more so just a montra for people to get behind
---
Its easy to remember
---
And all in all a great idea. However pretty much everyone from day one knew there would be SOME changes
---
We don't know officially, but it seems very likely that we'll have PvE, PvP, RP-PvE, and RP-PvP servers.
---
Luckily I have not had gold issues yet, but still havent gotten over about 75silver.
---
I plan on playing with a friend one day a week so I'll play a tank warrior because he want to play a priest.
---
But since I know I'll be playing more than him, I'll level my shaman on my own
---
When WoW first came out I was only 16 and in high school so most of my WoW buddies are people I haven’t seen in years. I do have 1 friend who I have kept in touch with who still plays currently. Unfortunately he isn’t very interested in going back and playing vanilla since he played it really hardcore back in the day. I on the other hand had a lot of athletic obligations during that time in my life and was only able to manage getting my warrior to level 60. Even though I won’t be sharing the experience with as many friends this time around I’m excited to further my own journey as I feel I have unfinished business with Classic. 
---
It should be fairly obvious I don't care about magic internet points, or else I'd presumably have acquired some at some point. You shouldn't either, that's just the anger in you.
---
As to my previous point, you are admittedly angry in real life over a video game concept. A concept man, seriously now.... When the game comes out if you like it then you should play it, if you don't then you shouldn't. How is it not this simple? Are you under the delusion you are owed something here? 
---
Because you're not; either the product will be worth paying for, in your opinion, or it won't. Absolutely nothing about this sort of transaction should promote anger and if it does then the problem is on your end. As I said, do \*yourself\* a favour and take a step back for a bit. The worst that can happen is that nothing will change.
---
I’m totally with you, and in my desire for no changes I’ve felt that way, something at least mild is likely coming.
---
But, I’ve also felt there’s a die hard portion of no changes that are still going to be up in arms over even one change.
---
Sadly yes. My old guild leader is joining the alliance, that traitor!
---
And he isn't enough for me to join him. If I ever find my BFF again, that would be the dream. 
---
Every other guild will be having clean clears and players will jump ship.
---
Freeze the first row and first column so that when you scroll you can still see them.
---
I love this guy 
---
If you are interested into the Mage class I've made a full Google Document about it, along with other things such as Raid BiS, raid talents, leveling talents, spell DPM, resis gear list, dungeon quests etc:

---
Yah, don’t you guys have phones??
---
It's OK dwarf is way better than human in PvP. Stoneforming away all the blinds.
---
Where is retri?!
---
Does this even still drop?
---
It took me around 30 solo runs to finally get Ashes of a’lar. 
---
They can release an exact copy of the game from that time period and people here would still complain that they don't have an accurate representation of the game because people don't like heavily in raids like Naxx because our phones are as strong as our PCs were.
---
Oh yea, forgot about responding to the crown. I intentionally left out the out door raid boss loot, or at least the most of it, uness it's high-end BiS. Those items are simply too hard to obtain for the majority.
---
What if my way of playing is to be the best?
---
Why is that not a valid choice for you to consider?
---
Hunters end up being kind of underwhelming at end game. Warlocks are better overall imo but it depends on what you want out of the game.
---
Thanks. I'm starting to figure out what's going on but other than some posts on Facebook from my old guild I just started looking at what's going on a couple of days ago.
---
Hi, /u/Noobelli
---
Paladin is the worst 5 man tank even in a group prepared to deal with their weaknesses. In a group that doesn't know how to play around a paladin tank properly disaster is likely.
---
Dungeons take longer because paladin tank needs to drink constantly.
---
Threat generation is better than warrior and you can put salv on all your DPS, but if you lose aggro it is very hard to get it back since you don't have a taunt.
---
Paladins don't inherently have any way to pull enemies from more than 10 yards away. Taking engineering gives you ability to throw cheap explosives once per minute. Some trinkets like Linken's Boomerang can be used to range pull but will need to wait for their cooldown and the 30 second equip cooldown. Due to this you almost always need to coordinate more with group to have others pull, which can be problematic when the puller also needs to line of sight ranged enemies if they aren't the brightest bulb.
---
You take slightly more damage than warrior and don't have powerful defensive cooldowns like last stand and shield wall.
---
You have a rez which is nice when grouping with resto druid healers that only have brez.
---
You're absolutely right on these things being unacceptable, but you're trying to judge the accuracy based on a demo ~8 months prior to release. And in any other case I wouldn't call such a judgement invalid, as in normal game development a large amount of those 8 months would still be spent on various things such as content creation and balancing.
---
However, Classic is largely a data conversion. The fact that Barrens/Wetlands worked indicates that, in all likelihood, the majority of content was already functional. That means that they have a vast amount of time to test for bugs and address these mechanical differences. Much more than any ordinary game would have in the same span of time.
---
In BlizzCon, Blizzard really did show passion with panels such as the art one. The excitement of that developer was definitely genuine. In interviews they repeatedly said that any differences in the demo should be assumed to be on the to-do list. And now we have someone with inside information giving you a subtle nod that it's looking good for the no changes crowd.
---
I understand that you still want hard evidence, and I, too, am incredibly distrustful of anything by Blizzard nowadays. But surely you can reach for the chill button and at least pretend to be hopeful? It's really depressing to doom-say even moments like this.
---
Thanks for the reply. I am in fact going warrior and my IRL friend, who wants to try out the game, will be rolling some support class as well. Would you mind if I send him your reply?
---
is there a way to post on the official forums? i just want to make a request but you cant even talk on the classic forums unless you have a wow account with a leveled up character.
---
I'd say that's the only way I can see someone thinking MC was super special. I raided on eq so I was used to mmo's and molten core was nothing special to me in fact  I was more like that's it? That being said I can totally understand why people are captivated by it if it was their first mmo raid.
---
I was massively into an anime called Avatar: The Last Airbender in 2005 so naturally I picked shaman to become the master of the elements :)
---
This is actually completely amazing! Holy frick! Thanks a lot!
---
We still don't know the extent or how they will implement sharding. Plus, it is always a possibility that when they said "we are exploring options" that they did, in fact, find some other way to handle the launch. A little optimism doesn't hurt =)
---
Every single shred of evidence from Blizzard has already pointed to this.
---
Nice to hear it from him ... but it is of ZERO surprise.
---
Classic is launching with less change than even the most dedicated "Bliz-like" private server has ever accomplished. Any change from this will entirely dependent upon the success of Classic (with possible impact of the current restructuring, Blizzard obtaining any more independent power over the Wow IP and market shifts).
---
ITT: people never satisfied
---
Don't tell people how to feel, I'm allowed to be angry when I damn well please, especially as it concerns something I'm passionate about in the hands of corporate American mucking it up.
---
And you don't get to say no to that because they're my feelings- so kindly fuck off, your condescension is a bad look.
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
You're letting your completionist get the best of you.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
**Part of the problem for me,** is that you don't really have enough character slots on one server unless you start doubling up.  For example:
---
1. Mining + BS (Armorsmith)
---
2. Skinning + LW (Tribal)
---
3. Herbing + Alchemy
---
4. Tailoring + Enchanting
---
5. BS (Hammersmith) + Engineering (Goblin)
---
6. BS (Swordsmith) + Engineering (Gnomish)
---
7. BS (Axesmith) + LW (Dragonhide)
---
8. LW (Elemental)
---
You'd need at least 11 slots if you were to go gathering + profession on everything.  And this means you only have 1 miner to grab minerals from for all those BS and Engineering specs.  It also assumes that I'm not missing Tailoring or Alchemist specializations (that I believe were added in TBC).
---
**However**, there are good reasons to double up on professions:
---
* Tailoring or Alchemy for more cooldowns (Mooncloth or Transmutes)
---
* Engineering, since most of the items require engineering
---
* Mining, Herbing, Skinning for more materials
---
what was your name back in the day? I played on magtheridon
---
I think our issue is the definition of min maxing. 
---
I generally group the min maxers as people who are constantly farming consumables, getting every world buff they can, make sure every class they have is perfect, etc. etc. fully maxing out their group.
---
I don't call people who want more viable specs or groups that do a moderate amount of farming min maxers, that's just going in prepared. 
---
In Vanilla, Hunter because I didn't want to have to rely on anyone.
---
In TBC, Druid, because my friend's guild needed an off-tank.  Ended up resto (due to misreading an item) and have been healing ever since.
---
I came to WoW from EQ1. Based on my experience in EQ1 I figured there would be a huge demand for healers for raiding and I'd have an easy time seeing all the content if I rolled priest. I was correct.
---
Yay Laughing Skull my vanilla server!
---
This is what inspired me to make a dwarf warrior. A stupid looking dwarf warrior.
---
Can't decide if I should make another stupid looking dwarf, or go horde this time.
---
people will tell you that it is good, however while it may be decent at holding aoe threat (not too much better than a warrior who has mastered class mechanics) (not even gonna mention the aoe damage  shield) Their single target threat blows dick, they have mana, which means more downtime for the party. They take way more damage than a warrior.
---
They can do the content, but it will be longer and harder than with a warrior. Most people will not run with you when they see you.
---
If you go dwarf you can ride mechanostriders + be the best race for priests. You'll get into guilds and raids very easily simply for being a dwarf priest. 
---
As for paladins.. they don't have taunt. They also only really spam one heal in raids and you have to buff A LOT.
---
&gt;But surely you can reach for the chill button and at least pretend to be hopeful?
---
Complacency is the death of progress IMO. You and I might differ on that and you seem like a reasonable dude, but being chill won't help the game I love not be more scuffed than it needs to be.
---
I'm pretty sure this just means that Blizz isn't going to be doing anything extra aside from delivering a playable vanilla wow experience. No tuning of bosses. No fixing bugs that weren't fixed by 1.12. And obviously no new content/balancing.
---
Considering the fact that this is a low effort cash grab (one that I'm personally very much looking forward to) this should all be very obvious.
---
when i was level 60 i was running ZG towards the end of vanilla (i was alliance). It was a somewhat PUG group, with members from 3 or 4 bigger guilds on the server. The raptor mount drops, and we did a group wide roll to see who would get it. I rolled a 94. My heart is raging. The last roll is another 94.... so we have to do a reroll between me and this other guy. I roll first.. its a 90!! he rolls.. 92... oh the pain.. I didnt sleep for weeks. It haunted me. I was that close. It can still keep me up at night if i think about it. So painful. So painful. 
---
When I first bought this game at EB-Games I just remember looking at this box front to back for a while. It really got me excited to try out the different races and explore a MMORPG for the first time. 
---
Oh and don’t get me wrong, I hope something gets worked out that absolutely no sharding is in the game, that would be great.
---
But, inversely, I also don’t want to be let down by praying the sharding away with optimistic thoughts in the face of the talk that we were given, to just be let down. 
---
But absolutely happy to cross my fingers and hope that they’ve taken on board the negative reaction and found alternatives. Sharding absolutely *might* not be in the game, but at this point, if it looks like a shard, and smells like a shard, then I’ll call it a shard :p
---
Thanks for sharing. I should probably try to set some objectives myself, I think that will help.
---
Non-progressive loot would be more #nochanges than progressive loot (since classic will start at 1.12). I think this is the type of thing he means when he says that the #nochanges people are going to win more than they think they are.
---
I mean a lot of people who subscribe to no changes don't actually want no changes.
---
The people I've talked to want a good game based on things like sharding, loot trading, etc. not being added and progressive itemization and item addition being added.
---
The name is god awful at expressing what it is that a lot of people find appealing about the movement in my opinion.
---
It works, but you have to be constantly alert and spam the shit out of consecration. Also, having mana will slow down your group a ton.
---
Female dwarf, ideally.
---
Paladins are worse than druids and warriors, but better than every other class.
---
And yes, I have tanked Vanilla dungeons on virtually every class.  Rogue, Warlock (also healed), Shaman, Hunter.  Mage if you count running through WC with a 70 healer (who refused to tank or do damage).  *Yes, it was TBC, but it was a Vanilla dungeon.*
---
Hardcore guilds didn't optimize back then??? LOL. Ok....
---
It's not worth it. Also the professions with valuable cooldown items (Leatherworking, Alchemy, Tailoring) are generally the best duplicate professions for altoholics as they provide good passive income, around 5g per day per profession but will vary depending on server economy.
---
Teebus was still BIS for looks
---
Back in vanilla, cross-guild pvp teams were a lot more common. 
---
Flip items on the AH, or grind like the rest of the mortals
---
Vanilla 5-mans are super easy if all 5 people in your group:
---
* Have at least half a brain cell
---
* Communicate
---
* Cooperate
---
They're hard when your mage can't sheep, your tank keeps breaking sheep, your warlock keeps tab-targeting to the sheep and dotting it (and then your mage keeps spamming sheep on it), and then your healer pulls extra mobs when it fears the mob off of it.
---
Then they’re not for #nochanges and we all agree that changes are necessary for the long term health of the game. 
---
Perfect. Then we all agree!
---
Also, sharding is the only viable way to maintian blizz-like popcaps without realm mergers. Just pointing that out. 
---
Yeah. DPS warriors gets showered in tank loot, once the 1st and 2nd tank is geared. Especially if you are interested in being the 3rd tank, who has to tank every once in awhile on a few bosses.
---
There is a chance I may get 1 or 2. I am not holding my breath as they are married and have a kid. They actually met in Wow Classic back in the day.
---
I got them both to play on the old (was it Nost?) pve server when it had a decent population. Then it closed and no pve server since has had a decent population. I'm hoping the stability of official servers will bring a lot to Classic.
---
The private server Drama has lost them as many players as they have gained. Classic becoming official is a MASSIVE minimum requirement for a great many potential players. Private server players often forget this as they already drank the emulator Kool-Aid.
---
Dwarfs get's a ram as their mount. It's gnomes who get mechanostriders and they can't be paladin or priest.
---
I remember soloing this on my prot paladin over and over again. Great memories 
---
I always have a hidden character nobody knows about.
---
Great escape from guild drama or whatever.
---
Because some of us don't care for supporting the Twitter presence of a random streamer. 
---
Lol what
---
Leadership does not have much to do with it. We were a casual guild everyone knew it. But our people knew what they were doing. we would lose them to larger guilds after we spent time gearing them up and training them. It was a big problem, we lost our raid leaders who then poached our tanks and all healers except me. then it happened again after we had a new raid leader.
---
Ok, maybe poor leadership, disloyal people were chosen to lead.
---
You’re really making yourself look bad with this crusade of rage you’re going on lol
---
My usual requirements for a class:
---
1. Capable of high damage
---
2. Tons of options
---
3. Complex game play to keep me interested
---
This lends toward me most often choosing hybrids or classes with tons of tools. I'm starting as Shaman but my fav classes (and basically the only ones I consider playing) are:
---
Shaman, Druid, Hunter, Rogue
---
If someone brings raiding into the conversation, they entirely miss the point of Classic being more than just raiding.
---
The fact that Activision-Blizzard is not explicitly looking to make a profit with this release (i.e. they didn't tell their investors to expect major profits from it) is a good sign; it points to the idea that passion is allowed to direct this project rather than shareholders.
---
They didn't optimize shit, in comparison to what even mediocre players have knowledge of these days. There's a reason why you don't see 'fully' buffed people in about any Naxxramas/AQ40 video from back then. And there's a reason why the DPS is much lower than what people do on private servers now. Yes, private server numbers might be overtuned, but not overtuned to the point where people are doing twice the DPS, or even close to that. On top of that, the average player usually look up guides much more than back then. About any game now, have guides written for it, and people following them.
---
I don’t have many memories of WoW but Stratholme and this mount is one of them.
---
Ran it so many times and never saw it drop and I honestly believed someone was pranking me.
---
High on my list of to-do’s when Classic launches.
---
Everyone should make the difference between "optimal" and "viable". I would like to tank dungeons as a Tankadin but I'm afraid most groups will reject me because of that min/max mentality. Accept the challenges if they come to you and it will be much funnier to achieve them than brainlessly following spreadsheets dictating you how to play.
---
Simply having feelings doesn't make them justified or healthy lad. I mean, are you seriously making the case that anything anyone feels is justified, sacrosanct and unquestionable? Or just that you are somehow special in this regard?
---
You see, the thrust of my point isn't about this game at all, I don't care about that, either I will like it or I won't and life carries on regardless.  I think it's actually far more important to challenge you about caring for your mental health. Probably I've done it wrong, it would hardly be the first time. But dude, seriously, if you think it's healthy to invest that sort of negative energy into hating something that does not yet exist then, once more, I have to ask you to question that. How can it be justified? Just because someone is making their game wrong does not justify hatred. Scorn, criticism, mockery by all means but the only person your anger is eating at is you. 
---
Different people, different guilds. You'll have casual players, semi hardcore players and hardcore players along with bad, mediocre and good players. Different groups will accept different players and different players will fit in different guilds with different attitudes and goals.
---
Yes some guilds will clear content quickly, yes some players will abandon weaker guilds but some people will prefer slow slogs through content while enjoying the company of other players.
---
Anyways, my original point was counter to yours where you said 
---
&gt;everyone will be crushing the early content
---
No, not everyone will be crushing the early content. There will be a lot of guilds that go slow and take many months to clear early content, there will be guilds that clear early content in the first few weeks and there will be a variety of guilds in between. So no, not every guild will be crushing early content, it's been like that throughout all of WoW's life, I don't know why you and others think Classic is somehow different.
---
Blizz has outright stated they're concerned with getting the color of fucking LAMPPOSTS correct.... your really think they're not going to get actual combat mechanics right?  
---
Ah I see. Yeah that wasn't the case on retail vanilla, nor is it on the pserver I play on.
---
Wtf is this? This isn't some forum where you can reserve the top comment. 
---
His approval rating is 42.1% which is the exact same as Obama at 762 days into their presidencies.
---
Just remember the American media are all based in NY/Cali/Washington so they have an extremely left-wing bias and pay no attention to what the majority of the country thinks. But yeah I guess it's wise to avoid those cities wearing that hat because liberals can be pretty ironically violent.
---
If you're visiting Disneyland or Vegas you'll be fine.
---
Wow really? Just for supporting the president? 
---
I don't know how I could be any clearer without also being condescending.
---
Okay this is the fairest criticism of my insanity so far.
---
Hardcore guilds did that stuff.
---
If someone is put off from the game because of the 2-hour loot trading window then it's good for the classic community as a whole. We don't need the cancerous vanilla purists that plague the private server communities. Blizzard explained their reasoning behind this list blizzcon and it made very much sense. 
---
I really don't understand how someone can be so far up their ass that they think a minor customer support QoL change will kill the game.
---
It's a fair point, I hope they use some tool, sharding or otherwise, to ensure long term server health.
---
Not at all go for it. 
---
16:10 would like a word.   It's a shame it never took off as much as I'd hoped.
---
Haha nice. I respecced DW fury when I got the flurry axe and thrash blade 
---
&gt; People on this sub don't seem to understand that the PServer crowd and  the official classic crowd are going to be vastly different.  
---
The private server people are still a product of this generation of gamers, to some extent. People are much more willing to look up guides, and it's much more the norm to do so. About any online game these days have guides written for them, and people following them religiously. It might not be to the same extent as private servers, but it's definitely much higher.
---
It won't be as easy in in Vanilla because people are smarter and Addons are better. 
---
LF people to play with! Going horde NA/est pretty casual need a grp to level up with. Up for anything, looking to have fun. 
---
I want to drool on my keyboard and still pull top tier dps.
---
Play mage,
---
spam frostbolt.
---
Correct, it did not work in original vanilla or in the classic demo.
---
You’ve thrown a big spanner in the works for me haha, I had ruled out enhancement till then, due to the fact I had just been hearing about how they aren’t good until hitting that high gear. Will definitely be taking a closer look now
---
If this is coming from a serious place of concern, I am a very angry person and I'm working on it, I've always been I might always be- life is a series of trying to improve.
---
That being said I think some anger is enlightened, in the same way I don't want to be angry about things that don't justify it I don't want to feel passive about things that one should be angry about.
---
I really love this game- it's something I'm incredibly passionate about and I want to use that passion to make a career in streaming from it. Whether or not the game is good means a lot more to mean than just any old game, it's personal.
---
There's a discussion to be had as to whether or not that's a healthy way of treating something out of your control, but I want this game to be the best it can be, and mollycoddling and ignoring skeptical ways of thinking won't get us any closer to the game we all want.
---
Definitely velcro
---
Cool?
---
I remember the exact moment I saw this piece of art lol. Me and my friend begged our moms respectively to buy the game and when we got the money and go ahead my mom drove both of us down to walmart and I remember on the ride home looking at this exact art. Felt so cool. 
---
Proof? About any guide and video I can find, from back then. Don't mention people going for a full buff, with DM buffs, world buffs and so forth. Basically every buff which decent/hardcore guilds do these days.
---
I understand what you mean, as it is a tricky situation. I'm staunchly on team #nochanges, so I'd hate for sharding to exist in any form as it'll have negative effects on the community, but on the other hand, I wouldn't want the community to fully abandon/boycott the game, leading to the failure of Classic and the last time Blizzard reaches out their hands to this overly-passionate community. I hope that Ythisens is right and we get something that'll appease 99% of team #nochanges. Of course, there will always be those 1% of gits that won't be happy regardless of what happens.
---
I added some stuff
---
Personally, I plan to have nine mains.
---
Infernals, I wanted to have them
---
It was quite underwhelming when summoning the first one but the game had delivered far more then I had ever expected so I was still really happy in the end choosing warlock
---
&gt;I really don't understand how someone can be so far up their ass that they think a minor customer support QoL change will kill the game.
---
Never said that and I hope you believe me when I say I don't think it will kill the game at all.
---
But I think it will be better without it, don't you?
---
That's my only point.
---
Why would one assume it wouldn't be? Blizzard has said at every opportunity it will be vanilla as it was in 1.2. They even explained aspects of vanilla that were that way simply because it was all technology at that time would allow (such as debuff slots) and those things would still remain despite being able to "fix" them now. And the last classic "remaster" product they did, Starcraft, was 100% faithful to the original.
---
I’ll still be playing too, I can get over Sharding and Loot trading etc even though I’m very aware of the negative sides of them, they’re just not ‘game breaking’ to me (which is probably exactly what Blizzard wants to hear, and a point that others might disagree with).
---
Well, misreading an iter and going from OT ti Resto seems a story worth of sharing!!!
---
On the flip side, as a hunter, I love playing with dps druids while leveling. If you do any BGs while leveling, a stealthed cat druid and my stealthed bm pet rip healers up before the other team can come to their aid.
---
When seeing this so many memories rush over me, i wish i could go back in time and experience it all over again. All the people i got to know etc. Also remembering going with my friends to a physical store at midnight to buy the game when it was released, waiting in line in the rain. And when we got home, there was a massive queue to the servers.
---
Psst. His comment is a meme. Druids are very good at staying in melee range or deadzone of hunter which makes them pretty good against hunters.
---
They never explicitly said "we're doing sharding" though. They said it was in discussion.
---
With the braid/pigtails hair.
---
Best casting animation in the game.
---
#1 for Stratholme UD part and Scholomance.
---
#2 for other 5mans.
---
The issue is that people in your party have to kind of work around you and have understanding that you do need some time to build up threat and your Consecration may mess up CC's. 
---
The RP is strong with this one... rogues have a place in bgs, don't you worry about us.
---
you're misremembering a lot of things.
---
[hex of weakness](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Hex_of_Weakness) has been around since the start of vanilla iirc, it's a troll priest racial spell, and a ridiculous one at that. against druids in 1v1, it's basically a death sentence, -20% healing and absolutely fucks their damage output.
---
[unstable affliction](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Unstable_Affliction&amp;oldid=550142) was a *magic* debuff and only did damage if it was actually dispelled - not other DoTs, not other debuffs, and definitely not curses.
---
I've actually played UA lock/spriest in 2v2s, with a troll shadow priest. it was the best anti-attrition setup, but warrior/druid combos often made our life even easier by not dispelling that goddamn hex, or, well... anything.
---
...and no idea if curse of exhaustion and curse of tongues were "in" at classic times, but they were a menace in organized pvp by TBC, so yeah, druids should have known better.
---
&gt;Well the fear is that the people leaving will cause the hypothetical 'scrubs' guild to basically be stuck and unable to either progress, or in a worst case scenario, raid at all.
---
This is also completely fine if this happens. People don't have to progress.
---
Druid heal. Checkmate 
---
My first character was a hunter because I played a Minstrel in DAoC and Aspect of the Cheetah seems like  group speed song.  
---
Everything said here is a good summary.
---
Dungeons get a lot harder at level 60 which paladins can still tank but I recommend you take it slow and start with the easier dungeons to gear up. 
---
At 58 start doing DM east and BRD runs, get all the gear from here that you can. You can also buy some blue boes and basic stamina enchants which go a long way.
---
Given that you've done the above you can move into Strat undead and DM west. You could probably do Strat live too but there aren't really any good tank drops here. The key to all these dungeons is having the right CC, being able to shackle/trap the ghosts in DMW is crucial and having sheep + something else in strat live. LBRS is probably on the same level but again not really any good tank drops to need to run more than once for the quests.
---
The hardest instances for Pally tank would be scholo and dm north cause of how hard some of the mobs hit. Even with raid gear I find killing krom in tribute an absolute bitch with a pally tank and usually end up acting as a second healer and making the fury warrior tank. 
---
&gt; No fixing bugs
---
They've stated that obvious bugs would be remedied just like bugs that allowed cheats/exploits. It's not going to be the same 1.12 client that was vulnerable to all the bugs/speedhacks/etc
---
I like angry man so warrior 
---
I respect your goal for sure!
---
But i do wonder who the hell has time to do such a feat in this day and time. This is insane. Even assuming that you'd be farming for the resources more or less uncontested it would take such a long time to achieve. Given that farmers will have the perfect routes for the very static spawns of resources in classic, I truly believe this feat is going to be almost impossible. But then again, a long time goal in classic can easily take 2-3 years so.. good to have long term goals I suppose :D
---
From what I remember from listening to a wow podcast featuring one of the wow devs they said they had an idea in its infancy for warriors regarding demon hunters. 
---
Like the guy said that picking night elf, and going 1h dual wield fury was their early vision of letting players feel like a demon hunter without actually having the demon hunter class in the game, but they had an even earlier vision of hero classes that was being floated around. The plan with the warrior was that if they went fury, and were night elf they could gain the appearance of a demon hunter through a series of class quests. At least thats what I thought the guy said. I think this was in countdown to classic or the classicast podcast with the kevin jordan dev.
---
Overall though I think its a bit near how they left it up interpretation because a lot of people I've heard actually went night elf to roleplay demon hunter qualities lol.
---
Not saying it’s not important, but this is just an ex-CM saying a hung, right?
---
Is the game he’s playing relevant to the excitement here?
---
Thx for any clarification.
---
On the other hand, fixing the missing textures in lampposts is a really,  *really* minor step in 'recreating' the vanilla experience.
---
Correct. The issue is few actually play them seriously. Their numbers are often bloated by casual alt play or raid logging healers.
---
When it comes to leveling, pvp, dungeons and ease of getting into groups ... a well played Feral (they can even have a healing set with them and it's good enough for dungeons) fits any group dynamic the best.
---
As for the OP's points with regard to Druid, on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best:
---
1. Feral has the least downtime of ANY class between fights. This competes with pet classes because a hunter must use mana to match Feral dps and a warlock's mana-neutral affliction rotation dps is far below than of a feral.
---
2. Feral can tank, heal or dps any dungeon. End game with HotW talent gives them enough mana in healing gear to easily get by. Bears are the best overall dungeon tank if they know how to play and know what gear to get.
---
3. Raids are easy if you go healer. Raids are possible as feral too but this is determined by your skill, dedication and guild makeup. You must Tryhard Druid to compete as Feral.
---
Thanks! Thats exactly what I was hoping to hear. Guess I’ll roll warrior
---
Im assuming your that same dude that was on those streams with kargoz. I see you also stream pserver shit. 
---
Just figured you might not want people to think you’re an autist that rages on the internet over a different feel to movement or a minor change to slow fall.. but have fun with that m80 lol
---
Have fun waiting around for 39 other people and spending 2 months without getting a single drop while I'm taking my 6th character through the awesome leveling experience that is vanilla wow. 
---
I think the most reliable and steady way is crafting mats. Specifically hide. Stockpiling hide was how I funded my way to level 60 (including mounts the second I hit the appropriate level).  
---
To get profitable at crafting is going to take a significant investment first.
---
Calling them negative shits is allowed when the more info we get the more it points towards positive stuff.... the louder these guys get about the shit. No one is saying lick Blizzards boots, they dont deserve it. But we are saying, stop downplaying the stuff they get right and pretending like this project has done anything other than improve constantly.
---
Theres a gap between being a corporate fanboy, and being a completely insufferable complaining cry-box.
---
&gt;Proof? About any guide and video I can find, from back then don't mention/show people going for a full buff, with DM buffs, world buffs and so forth. Basically every buff which decent/hardcore guilds do these days.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Even myself, going through AQ40 I had never thought of, or seen mentioned, that going for all buffs was a viable and/or thought of strat.
---
A few reasons. First, world buffs weren't in vanilla early on. Second, a lot of the time it wasn't worth the time it saved on clear content. Third, there were alternative buffs that weren't as extreme, but significantly cheaper. Many guilds used those on anything that wasn't progression.
---
Regardless of that and despite your lack of knowledge, it WAS used a lot for Naxx progression once fights were learned. Most "hardcore" guilds either used it or were aware of it. There was discussion on whether those kills were 'legit' before that strategy was generally accepted. Some never did out of principle, as they felt it was cheating.
---
Yeah you preface the word "faith" with the word "little" 
---
I was trying to reach the defense cap through every means necessary.  That included PvPing for specific pieces to get resilience (since the important part of the defense cap is the crit immunity, and honestly resilience was almost better for druids than defense), running dungeons, and whatever else I could.  I wanted to be defense capped by our first raid night.
---
I also picked up a ton of leather caster gear during this time as well.
---
It was getting close to the first raid night since I hit 70, and I was not yet defense capped.  What could have gotten me there is the Kodohide set.  However, the Kodohide set had "Requires Leatherworking: 350" on it, and I didn't have LW, and there was no way I could afford to get LW high enough to use the set by raid time.  Plus, the guild had a Warrior that went OT while I was leveling, so the OT spot wasn't really needed.  *I was salty about that because they knew I was leveling to be the OT.*
---
Anyway, "Requires Leatherworking: 350" applied to the set bonus.  I could have equipped the pieces just fine, I just wouldn't have gotten the set bonus, and the set bonus wasn't necessary for me to hit the defense cap.  Had I known that, I might have gone feral, might have ended up OT (might not, I don't know).  But as it stands, I switched over to my caster gear, which WAS good enough to heal, and that's all she wrote.
---
In TBC I mained a resto druid.  In WotLK, I started on a DK intending to be the OT...by Ulduar I was had already been a Resto Shaman (we had more tanks than healers) and was back to Resto Druid again, and in ICC I went Holy Pally.  In Cata, I bounced around doing Resto Shaman, Holy Paladin, Disc Priest, and Holy Priest.  Pretty much been healing ever since.
---
Just never as a Monk.
---
I hate Monks.
---
I was a hardcore Diablo 2 player when I started WoW. So I thought Druid would be just like D2 Druid. While cute kitty and cuddly teddy bear aren't exactly werewolf and werebear, it still became my favorite class in the game. I have always and still do hate Boomkin though.
---
I honestly don't know what class I'm gonna roll. I'd like to think I'd roll a warrior again and do all the things I missed since I started vanilla at the end but  I'm betting I just roll a pally and heal or maybe a hunter. Plus it depends on if any of my friends end up coming back to play, I might roll my class to compliment theirs.
---
&gt; right click reporting
---
is that really a thing people care about?
---
Well we do all get to choose the things we care about. To me this is just a game I hope they get right, but to you it's more, so I stand corrected on that. But I do think it's very important that passion not be unbridled. I fear I don't have the right words here but the point I am trying to convey is that you don't need to check your feelings, or disregard them in any way. But they are just one point of view from all the points of view that make up a cohesive appreciation of things. Which as I read it now is just a stupidly verbose way of saying that you should try to think about what you feel. I really do speak from experience on that and as regards my sincerity, for what it's worth, this exchange represents a significant percentage of all the posts I have made in however many years I have been here.
---
Hush! You've already revealed too much! What's next, you'll start blabbing about the one weird trick to... no. No, I must not even hint at it. I will never reveal the Wu Tang secret.
---
Very torn because I've been horde for life, and historically I'm an undead mage..so I have to bring back my old main but the thing that has changed since those times is me really wanting to main a dwarf, the only race I like on the alliance side. I love dwarves so I'll have to work something out, maybe on an RP realm while my undead mage is on pvp server
---
Oh boy I can dig a documental about wpvp.
---
The young mages roams around collwcting herbs, what he isnt aware off are the pack of rogues that have chosen a new prey. A hunter in the distance warns them but is too late the lower level mages die in the attack, many mages quit the game, only the strong survive.
---
edgy
---
truth be told, anyone after good stats would go there, since there are like 2300% more votes.
---
instead, you say you don't want to support(??, it's still a strawpoll link) soda. goes to show that you don't care at all and just commented to show your dislike towards soda.
---
I've played on one of those huge pop pservers and still never saw anyone riding that mount. It's so ridiculously rare in vanilla you may as well forget it even exists.
---
A whole 100 times? 
---
Oh I believe it, I'm not saying you have to join a guild to have a PVP squad. Just that its a little silly to say guilds are ONLY for 40 mans. Guilds can be organized for whatever the hell they want. 
---
It will be hard to come by when the game first launches I think. It's from a world drop recipe and the herbs are only found in either AV or Alteric Mountain. It's also required for the Badlands quest for the sprint trinket so it sells pretty solid all the time I think. 
---
This picture made me have a moment. I really will never have the feeling I did when first playing this game. My mindset playing the game is so different now (still love it), and I will never have the childish feeling of exploring this game. Even the sounds back then were so loud and exciting. I think my first character was a dwarf hunter and all the snow falling was the most beautiful thing ever. Walking into Stormwind and Ironforge was fucking epic. I am positive that no game will ever in the future of gaming have this impact. That is until we are deep diving like in SAO. 
---
It can be a lot faster though since pally excels in large aoe pulls, and is able to hold aggro from mages uses blizzard quite easily, overall reducing the entire time the dungeon takes.
---
Pick the race that you'll most enjoy playing for the time you'll be with the game. Not a single group of normal individuals will refuse to have you if you're a human or a NE priest. That just doesn't happen. Don't base your enjoyment off of what random strangers on the internet who spend all day on shitty private servers have to say. You'll never have fun.
---
I'm not entirely sure what you are saying here but the drop rate was increased in wotlk.
---
DHKs were a fucking awful mechanic. They did absolutely nothing to prevent or discourage griefing (the ostensible reason they were first implemented in the first place) and basically ended most large-scale WPvP.
---
I would be over the goddamn moon if it were announced they were going to be left out of Classic. At least on PvP servers.
---
Apparently so, in this sub at least. I think most people who downvote/upvote and comment here are total die hard classic fans though. Most players will not care about right click reporting or loot trading I believe
---
True,but in practice back in vanilla,there MIGHT have been one or two smalllll PVP guilds on a server. You needed to raid for gear, which meant you affiliated with a raid guild.
---
Seems like a super minor detail to worry about.  I mean that's not even remotely on my list of things I remember when I think about Classic WoW lmao.
---
If you do decide to go oceanic .. check the looking for group post :)
---
A certain alliance oceanic guild is one PM away from inviting you :) wink wink
---
That said, it depends on when you are moving and for how long. You can always pay to transfer your character down the track.
---
I saw the picture and remebered the Dwarf’s name was Hammerfall!
---
Omg, nostalgia in my face.
---
They can afford to do a lot of things, but that's not why businesses do things. So thanks for proving my point. 
---
Yeah this is because they require more knowledge about the mechanics of the game.
---
This is why when you learn how to level them efficiently they feel really rewarding!
---
Check out monkeynews 1-12 leveling and some of his stream, he’s the best at this class and a true levelling beast. I remember crossing him on day 1 of a fresh server, he was level 23 in duskwood travelling with 2 wolves cleaving em as he was going toward his next quest xd.
---
Im myself torn between mage priest rogue warrior, its a struggle.
---
If you play more than 20-25 hours a week tough just make an alt if youre undecided!
---
If you fucking hate people and you love 5 hour long dungeons than its amazing.
---
I've still got all my old boxes at home. I open them from time to time. I was considering getting the disks framed honestly haha. 
---
I tried doing this in Korean. I was not successful but it was because I realized that I needed to study some more Korean. Maybe I will give it another shot...
---
Yeah frostbolt spam and some fire blast just before the mob dies to max your dps.
---
Trolls at least get berserking haha. Winter’s chill mage get to cast early rank 1 fb to get debuffs going. Still a fun class if you enjoy wow/drinking haha
---
Yeah and I totally get that, I've mentioned in another reply that there was definitely no definitive line like "it will be there for good".
---
But what I'm pointing out is to consider this: When Ion addressed sharding for a couple of minutes on day two of Blizzcon, it came by way of a fan question in the Q+A session - all of those questions are pre-approved and pre-screened (I was there and actually got up out of my seat and asked Ythisens, who was minding the Q+A line I could ask one and he said that they were all set up in advance - unlike the Diablo debacle).  So Blizz has chosen to present and address this issue, and Ion had a cooked up answer ready to go.  
---
Then he goes on to say, and I'm directly quoting here (I really hope this isn't transcribed somewhere else, as I just took 10 minutes to do it haha):
---
"OK, so for some folks who have been jumping into the Classic demo, you may have noticed, but if you jump in with your friend you're not necessarily always seeing each other in the same version of The Barrens right now.  That is sharding. There has been a lot of concern and discussion expressed around it on the internet.   
---
We understand.
---
First off, the demo is kind of a special case, because it's not an organic world where everyone is spread out.  It's literally every single character using a template, being created at the exact same point in the world, in The Barrens or Westfall.
---
We leverage that tech to make the demo experience run more smoothly.
---
Now, *that said* (emphasis added + Ion's catch phrase), we recognise that launching WoW Classic poses a couple of meaty challenges.
---
Unlike launching a traditional game that's brand new, where you can assume that everyone that's jumping in there on launch day has the intent to at least explore playing it long term, we expect that early on with Classic, there are going to be some people who are there die hard, dedicated, they're racing to defeat Ragnaros and Onyxia.  
---
There are going to be others who just want to check it out casually and they just want to see what all the fuss is about, they want to see what they missed.
---
And, our concern is, I think it's exactly as you suggest, what's that going to look like? What's that going to do to realm communities, as some server populations may dwindle over time?
---
That is where we are looking at using sharding in a very limited way.
---
We understand, and I understand completely, that sharding is antithetical to a cohesive Classic community.  
---
We are competing over limited resources.  When Lord Kazzak is up, and guilds are racing to defeat him, there needs to be only one Lord Kazzak.  You're trying to get, you know, if you're trying to lock down the thorium vein spawn in limited sections of the world, you should be competing over limited resources.
---
*That said*, when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials, when everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time limited way, to solve the initial launch day load problems, while making sure in the long run, that as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population as single worlds for everyone to live in."
---
My take on that is that, is that while we're not told definitively **you are getting sharding** or how long sharding will be around for, the language used and the length at which its addressed seems to pretty strongly indicate that it will be there at the start?
---
Saying "That is where we are **looking at** using sharding in a very limited way." doesn't diminish the interpretation that it is most definitely coming, even in a limited aspect, just because he chose the words 'looking at'.  People often say 'oh he only said they were looking into it, that doesn't mean it's coming'.  But if we just stare at those words on their own, as opposed to the context and the totality of the statement - I mean, I just personally can't see any other way to read that.  
---
TLDR: If you look at the transcription of what Ion said on sharding, my read on it is this: 
---
Sharding is coming.  Its use may be limited, but that is dependant on how realm populations balance over time.
---
Here's the deal.  If they don't get this right, people will just continue to play on private servers.  Most of them are 99% just like classic.  If they introduce microtransactions or have a bunch of buggy shit in the game that frustrate people, then people are going to go elsewhere to get what they want.  Blizz has a great opportunity here to get a bunch of people on board and throw money at them.  
---
Thanks, spent the day overspending on caffeinated drinks to focus at work due to that lost hour of sleep.
---
I have mixed thoughts about this post. On one hand I agree that you should play how you want to, if that means you want to play an unviable spec, so be it. If you want to go in blind; more power to you mate. I don't mind one bit what you do with your time in the game.
---
That being said I 100% understand why people are planning it out, and planning to play a certain way. You are not required to change the way you play, but you also can't expect people to make something harder on themselves if they decide not to bring a prot pally.
---
I'm planning out what I want to do personally. I understand the class I want to play fairly well (Priest) and have a general idea of what my leveling will look like. That being said; I really enjoy the other elements of the game such as professions and dungeons. So I'm not planning on skipping over those until I hit 60. Ill do it as I go, break the monotony for myself, and still hit 60 within those first 2 months. I'm going to play it in a way that I'll enjoy it, and some people, such as the power leveling Joana, enjoy speeding to cap level as fast as they can. It's really to each their own. 
---
Little complete confidence, seems like an oxymoron. Like I think Classic will be a tiny smashing success or Retail has been a huge inappreciable failure.             
---
Also with sharding and loot trading still in should we really be sucking a fat one just yet? Might not cause Classic to be a failure but i'm not ready to mindlessly cheer lead Actiblizz when I dont think they would bat an eye to throw in tokens, cash shops or any other things if for a single moment they think it'll milk us without driving us off.
---
You said this about Druid leveling:
---
"their DPS isn't anything to sneeze at while leveling"
---
Incredibly untrue. Feral is one of he highest single target damage levelers. Apparently very few know how to gear them or play them correctly. Even in 60 dungeons (as they don't required raid buff stacking), my feral was doing over 400dps in Dire Maul before I even completed proper enchants and pre-BIS. A better geared rogue in the party did SLIGHTLY higher average dps than me. Power shifting is real dude.
---
"#Nochanges" has never been a consistent thesis, but most of the nochangers are people who want Blizzard to recreate their favourite pirate server and *call* that "#nochanges".
---
An eternal, unchanging 1.12 with content massively nerfed by technological change, massive overpopulation, hyper-rapid respawn, nerfs to instance farming and a Ragnaros you can down in greens is all "no changes". But touch one thing to make it better balanced and they have a meltdown.
---
So you respond eight days later and the response was "You proved my point".
---
You said they cannot afford it, they can afford it, they don't want to pay to have it because it's "not in the budget", they set the budget.
---
If you are telling me that Actiblizz's profits are so paper thin they cannot afford to hire a GM, maybe they should get out the video games buisness.
---
I am blocking you not because you are a troll, but because you are a crappy one.
---
I'll change my tune if they do it, but I think they're going to be in for a surprise when they meet a genuinely Blizzlike Ragnaros.
---
&gt;First, world buffs weren't in vanilla early on.
---
I know that. I don't see how that changes anything. Notice how I said AQ40/Naxxramas.
---
&gt; Second, a lot of the time it wasn't worth the time it saved on clear content.  
---
But it is now? - Literally that statement gives away that people are better and more optimized than back then, because having those buffs are definitely worth it now.
---
&gt; Regardless of that and despite your lack of knowledge 
---
Lack of knowledge? Where do you see me showing lack of knowledge? The fact that you don't agree with me on guilds using them?
---
&gt; it WAS used a lot for Naxx progression once fights were learned. Most  "hardcore" guilds either used it or were aware of it. There was  discussion on whether those kills were 'legit' before that strategy was  generally accepted. Some never did out of principle, as they felt it was  cheating. 
---
I don't see any proof of this, though. So it's anecdotal evidence at best. I'm literally trying to find videos or any kind of proof of your statement. Can't find any. About all forum posts and videos don't mention or show people using them.
---
100% agree. Well said. 
---
I play priest, a nice juicy. target, while my 2 buddy's watch in the shadows for any takers.
---
Meh, my guild will become DHK champions if they leave it lol. We will be doing offensive large scale Wpvp very often.., gotta choose between the two.. world pvp in classic &gt; spamming bgs 
---
You're fucking retarded.
---
I really do agree with you. Just wish at least a thread like this could be less depressing.
---
I will be going for the Tanking trinket. The Cat one is nice to be sure, but I think long term the Bear is a better choice as it is BiS forever for a Bear. 
---
I don't think you understand the meaning of that phrase, https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/nothing+to+sneeze+at
---
my biggest regret in life will be that I only have one downvote to give.
---
WAIT! I can thumbs down youtube too!
---
&gt;This limitation was a technical one
---
Being a technical limitation does not give it much better argument to why it should be changed. I dont have much problem with either 8 or 16 but i sure will have issues with a higher amount of debuff slots. I am not sure why I am against it being changed but i dont really see why it should be changed in any case.
---
Honestly I dunno how he plays like that, even on Retail I feel like I never have enough space on all my bars, but to be fair that includes potions and multiple teleport items and stuff
---
Its right up there with Warlock voidwalker tanking.
---
I vaguely remember this, was a horde rogue right?
---
I remember someone in vent saying it and laughing at him.
---
We don't know yet what their plans are for itemization. It's assumed so far that content will be progressive based and since Bloodvine comes out with ZG in 1.7 then it seems logical to me that it won't be available at launch.
---
I’m not *overly* concerned with it, but I’d much prefer it not being there.
---
Feels weird calling that an anime lol. 
---
This is way to clever for me to understand, but I laughed anyway 
---
You're an insane man. I like it.
---
I'm not planning that myself. I'm hopelessly addicted to Mage. I'll most likely make a Priest and/or Rogue twink (39+) at some point, but that's as far as I'll go in terms of alts in all likelihood.
---
&gt; It's from a world drop recipe
---
Frost oil is a vendor recipe on a ~90 minute refill. Should be pretty easy to get if you're level 30+
---
Well if I misread your intent ... the data is still useful.
---
Dwarves can ride mechanostriders when exalted with Gnomer, humans and Nelvs can't.
---
The biggest key is having a second account as your bank alt. Being able to have 100% AH presence while you're off playing elsewhere is insanely efficient.
---
What do you get for turning in 1200 tickets?
---
Oh snap. TIL. Thanks for this gonna try to stealth my way there as soon as I can. 
---
Some rogues develop deviant relationships with other species and this perverse behaviour allows them to prey upon their own kind. Such rogues are rightly abhorred by their kin and many are eventually driven by guilt to savagely turn on their previous ally or fall upon their own daggers in shame.
---
That's true. You'd still have to run a ram up until Blackwing Lair release afaik. You're not getting exalted before cloth turn-in becomes a thing.
---
As far as we know loot trading is in. They are basically not spending the money on GM's to fix loot issues and instead are going to use the system that is already in the game to allow players to fix it themselves. Sharding is the thing that is up in the air as to how far it will go or if they will use it at all.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Loot trading was confirmed during BlizzCon 2018. Sharding hasn't been confirmed but [heavily implied](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769548630#post-15) because he specifically states that phasing and cross realm will not exist, but says no such thing about sharding.
---
I think it requires a subscription. Not totally sure.
---
Mage will be just as competitive as warriors and rogues
---
Well the way I was trying to frame it was like, guildies log on for raid night, and there just aren't enough people on to do anything. Not a consensus among the guild to not try harder, but this unspoken bleeding out of players.
---
Ion Hazzikostas' handle was Gurgthock. He was the leader of the Elitist Jerks guild before he was hired to work at Blizzard.
---
Him and many others like him such as Indalamar are best known for being the first generation of theorycrafters, paving the way for all who came after and built the theorycrafting industry we see today.
---
Speaking of the theorycrafting industry, there's a snowball's chance in hell that theorycrafting hubs such as Icy Veins or Ask Mr. Robot miss out on the opportunity to theorycraft Classic. There's too much potential advertising revenue to skip out.
---
I'm excited to finally see if the theoretical mathematical maximum DPS output of each class can be realized and if any of the hybrids have any potential for making it past charity status.
---
TBC was the sweet spot for me. A few minor QoL changes over Vanilla but still challenging and very rewarding. I’d jump over to TBC in a heartbeat. 
---
OK Ill give you Fury warriors are not DPS in Vanilla, but they haven't not always been top dps in every expansion
---
Resto Shaman. So high in demand for totem utility, which is independent of gear, that guilds will be willing to put up with mediocrity. Alternatively holy paladin because they perform very well even when undergeared or not using consumables. Blessing of Light makes rank 1 flash of light or low rank holy light spam have extremely high healing per mana. Priest only slightly outperforms holy paladin when both are raid geared and using full consumables.
---
Their classic panel focused on things like how they are adjusting the world to have the exact levels of fog and lighting, they mentioned how one zone had lighting slightly off and they're working on fixing it further. They are going into a lot of detail on seemingly the most (relatively) pointless things, but you think there's no way they'll work on recreating the _core mechanics of the game_?
---
I also fail to see how the modern engine is going to hold them back, they've already stated how they have the old data working with the modern engine, and how they're fixing the outlying pieces such as the old spell book.
---
Fair enough, seems unlikely from my point of view though.
---
The thing is, even though it was a technical limitation, original raid bosses (MC) were designed and tuned with that debuff limit. So doubling it, or increasing it to 40 or whatever like in later WoW Expansions, quickly moves towards trivializing the boss fights because you could stack so many more debuffs that would increase dps.
---
Also arkimond not Archie mond.
---
Blizzard mentioned the dilemma of 8 vs 16 slots:
---
- 8 slots was a technical limitation back in the day and NOT a planned mechanic. Raiding wasn't even a planned mechanic until in late development.
---
- 1.12 should be based around 16 slots, but content progression will drive the game and 16 slots didn't reflect early raid content.
---
So, does Blizzard just make it 16 slot and adjust early 8 slot balance? Or do they emulate the slot limits to match early raid dynamics?
---
So far "No Change" is the repeated emphasis by Blizzard, so I expect 8 slots upon launch.
---
I think it would make the game a bit more interesting. Having to relearn where the best items came from and who dropped what would add a lot to the game, but I know people dislike that so it's a pipe dream.
---
I totally agree, I don't particularly want to play with hard liners who say 'if Change X is in the game then I won't play' either.  These things aren't game breaking to me, and North is saying the same thing, but I definitely would *prefer* if they weren't there, and I don't think that's an outrageous thing to say.
---
It barely makes any difference, you just have all the enough room for the stackable raid debuffs. There’s still no room for any sort of luxury rotation debuff slot abilities like rupture/rip/serpent sting.
---
Progressive itemization doesn't really make sense for classic since there's no TBC on the way... the rest are very minor changes, sharding for example is being spit balled for the first week or two... big deal
---
I don't think anybody see him as anti-vanilla. The only anger I've seen directed towards Ion is in the context of him being the current Game Director of WoW. People hold him responsible for the state of the current expansion.
---
The wow we have now is about 40% as good as vanilla, in my opinion, mainly because i have no idea who i'm playing with in a group and nobody seems to give a sh1t about anyone else they are playing with.
---
If i can get to play a version of wow that is 80% of what i first played back in 2004, I will be be extremely happy. Anything more than that would probably just cause me to have a stroke. :)
---
I dont mind sharding in the starter areas at the beginning. I remember how impossible it was to find enough mobs to kill for the starting quests as a dwarf when there was only about a couple of dozen people in the area when wow launched.
---
I'm going to get the chance to relive the best mmo i've ever played and i guess i've played just about everyone since Ultima Online.
---
Be happy people, Its not often that you get the chance to relive any part of your life and at least this time around you will have some idea of what to do. :)
---
You aren't getting four Thunderfuries with blizzlike drop rates.
---
Honorable mention: Concentration Aura. Warlocks in particular will fancy having access to it, esp. talented.
---
THIS, I always have a secret character that is unrelated to my main/alt.
---
I think the argument would be to allow other specs to raid. Other examples are feral Druid, warlocks, and enhancement shaman. All are severely handicapped by the debuff limit. 
---
What if my fun is min/maxing? :S
---
Based on what the no change crowd has been asking, this means blizz has a time machine in development. 
---
If it's a strawpoll why didn't you just link it directly?
---
Also how was what I said edgy?
---
I played mostly druid in the beta, but they were not for me. When launch came i started a rogue because I thought they looked cool, but i started on an other server than my buddies, I still wanted to make my friends join me on my server since i was already lvl 10, so I just rolled an ugly human female mage for fun. It's the same character I've been playing up until a couple of months into bfa.
---
Ah, social skills. My only nemesis.
---
The poll doesn't define between PvE or PvP server. PvE servers have a much higher percentage of hybrids played and a lower percentage of rogues than PvP servers. Both server types also have a DRAMATIC drop off at end game for hybrids.
---
I can easily see a poll reflecting this, as this poll is far too open to rate the true class spectrum per server, per side, at specific level ranges.
---
Paladin
---
\- They look cool
---
\- High survivability is fun
---
\- I like the class fantasy
---
\- Ret is both fun and good with gear
---
\- Good vs Rogues
---
i'm aware it was mildly increased in wotlk, but this guy is basically saying it was increased by blizzard to the point where pretty much everyone can get it because those damn millenials and their mmount collecting /s 
---
like. it may have been increased from idk like 0.1 to 0.8 but that's still 0.8. i've played for 7 years and only seen it drop once
---
I am worried about dm release and 1.12 talents making mc far too easy. While it fucking sucks to wipe a whole night on a boss, flaring through mc on the first night will be a lot less fun in the long run. So 8 slots for a while makes sense for me then switch it to 16 somewhere in the middle. But i would never have released DM  with MC if i had a wow classic rerelease so what do i know. 
---
I feel the same way
---
Night Elf on Dunemaul-EU had this bad boy.
---
I take issue with the representative of my Warlock class casting freaking Demon Armor like a newbie when there's a serious battle going on.
---
My wife and I are playing when classic drops. We both have two favorites we plan to pair up for synergistic benefits.  Warrior/Shaman and Priest/Mage. Each will likely get equal play time. We may even introduce a 3rd, Hunter/Druid. And yeah, we will be takings things casual. 
---
Basically Monkeynews stream. High level warrior gameplay with good beats and maybe some comments/discussion from streamer about gameplay.
---
Are people actually upset at sharding for the initial rush of people? I played WoW day 1 and dealing with crashes, loot bugs, and 5 billion people pigeonholed by quests that couldn't compensate for the population isn't what made WoW great.
---
I mean, I personally did it at one point. But clearly, it didn't exist unless you saw it -_-.
---
I firmly believe that the appeal of Classic today and back when it launched, is the dream of playing a version of Wow when it more closely reflected an old school mmorpg by design.
---
The very moment Wow launched, it began it's journey toward shifting to a raid focused and vertical scaling game. Nobody can claim that even Classic was perfect. Frankly it never lived up to it's initial design expectation and areas most players were screaming to have expanded, wasn't.
---
Blizzard made a choice at a certain point post launch to narrow the content focus. This is a very common choice by developers once their more open ended development phase is over. Every choice along this design focus engineered Classic's original scope away from early expectations.
---
Classic obviously is the only way to experience Wow's early days, but we will also experience to choices that slowly directed Wow to it's current and dramatic decline.
---
&gt; Druid tanks are way better for 5 man tanks because they have thorns and with improved thorns, which should be taken for 5 mans, 3pc t1 you can get a fairly beefy thorns buffs to generate threat with, druid tanks are very tanky with practically dungeon and questing gear, no raid gear required. they can hit over 10k hp as a tauren with pre raid and full raid buffs, and cap armor
---
TIL with Tier One class loot which is not raid gear and full raid buffs a druid can tank 5-toon instances.
---
I wish I could!
---
There were hundreds of things people noticed being wrong in the classic demo, all the little interactions and weird things that the vanilla engine did when you used abilities will be really hard to recreate.
---
Yes, a demo is a demo, but I still cannot see them perfectly re creating these little details that make it feel like our favorite game by summer of this year.
---
But those little things are very important to games. Like if somebody tried to re create classic competitive games like Quake or Counter-strike, if they don't have all those little quirks that shaped the game, it won't feel the same.
---
Things like spell batching for example, it was that way because of techincal limitations, but it also changed gameplay and the balance of classes.
---
If it doesn't even compete with private servers in authenticity, what is the point?
---
I mean, even if TPS didnt matter at Stage 1, the items listed are still pretty bad. Like Ring of Defense is not something you should be wearing. Drakeclaw band is objectively better, why isn't it mentioned?   
---
 You are setting ppl up to be 3.4k hp 400 defense tanks with 0 threat gen or hit %.   
---
I don't think anyone should actually wear Stalwart Clutch over Omokks or Brigam Girdle (Depending on patch of the  items in classic). 
---
The game is not so hard that you need a optimal raid group to finish all content. And I'm pretty sure enhancement shamans would still be handicapped with debuff limit. Feral druids dont use dots on 16 slots and while I can imagine with proper scaling it can be better, neither rip or rake scales with crit. It will be fun to try it out when it launches but honestly with the already hard rotation I cant see it make a major impact dps wise. 
---
So I am hoping for 8 slots at first that then becomes 16 but can live with 16 at launch i guess. Since I am not making too much fuss about DM launching with MC.
---
Rarity + necessity = money
---
there are a lot of casual guilds on nd and a lot of casual players, lol.
---
&gt; Every single shred of evidence from Blizzard has already pointed to this. 
---
(Plays Blizzcon clip re: Sharding &amp; Loot Trading)
---
Look, I understand that Blizzard have said a lot of great things that have tickled us in all the right spots when they've talked about authentically recreating the Classic experience, which I found great too, but to say that 'every single shred of evidence' points to no changes is not the case.
---
This was (is?) on the official website under wallpapers. I really miss the old website with the screenshot of the day, the bg overview, the honorsystem overview and the old forum look
---
A really powerful melee or cater amulet (orb of the darkmoon / amulet of the darkmoon)
---
There are better raid alternatives but these you can eventually grind out on your own.
---
Im not rerolling lock soley because threat is such an obnoxious barried to your dps. I cannot imagine having played horde on top.
---
The worry is mass reporting causing an automated mute before a GM ever looks at it. Apparently it's how it works in retail when some number of people right click report one person they are automatically muted for a day or something. 
---
In retail that isn't a huge deal, but in classic having limited chat access could easily mean you don't get to play for whatever time you are muted due to not being able to find or make groups. 
---
As long as there are huge penalties for doing it I don't think it will be a problem, but I also doubt blizz will penalize people for it. So you have the chance of a streamer/guild leader/group of assholes getting pissed at someone, telling their guild/fans "Hey, report that guy" and all of a sudden 200 reports hit, he's muted and no GM even looks at it for 3-4 days long after his auto mute is over.

My pleasure never\_fucking\_giveup, thanks for checking out The Sinner Files too, I've been used to catching some heat over that but I really do like it now, it wasn't all put on.  In saying that, let me empathise with you - I HATED it with the fire of a thousand suns when I first saw it, but on the second viewing I did a complete 180, so I know where you're coming from, believe me, and a lot of your points will have merit, I've just personally changed my tune.

Ah and even deadwind pass has a purpose. They have ogres that drop a specific enchant.

Youre being pedantic. You know exactly what he means by "little faith". Nothing wrong with optimism jeeze.
---
Data mining would render it pointless within hours. 
---
Jumping here because it is the higher level comment.
---
It totally depended on the fight and what level of "optimization" you're talking about. Going high on buffs was a thing for Nefarian, C'thun, and Loatheb in particular. I think Patchwerk got a lot of stuff but not quite the same level. You'd also have plenty of people in a 40 man raid with good but not great gear because that's what you had to work with.
---
Part of it was game knowledge (looking at Best in Slot guides and stuff now seems crazy to me. There was still debate on some stuff and you'd never have a full raid filled with mostly that gear anyway in vanilla), part of it was less clumping of talent (pre Character Transfer you were 100% limited to who was on your server and then even after they introduced character transfers it took a while before there was heavy cross server recruiting from top guilds), and part of it was that most of the fights were more about figuring out how to do it than absolute min/maxing to beat them so maxing everything for every attempt was a good way to waste a ton of time and money.
---
If people min/max and go as hard as they do now with all the guides and stuff the fights are probably going to be pretty easy. Vanilla was brutally hard but some of the difficulty was having to raid with people who were kind of bad and even the best people having to figure out the encounters from scratch.
---
