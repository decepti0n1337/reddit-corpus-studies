Most of them are Atom shop items unfortunately. As far as i’m aware the only ones obtained through normal gameplay are the Nuka Cola T-51, Quantum X-01 and the various Brotherhood of Steel paints for T-60.

Bug. Has to do with logging in and out while wearing your excavator power armor. It may get fixed eventually, so don't get used to it, but enjoy it while you can.
---
Oh, thanks forgot the price since it disappears after you buy it
---
He sounds like Bender
---
Is there a list of the masks?
---
All i can say is this is a video game, it's main purpose is to entertain. To entertain everybody that has bought and paid for the game, that includes you and the opposing party. So if what you are doing gets to a point where it's no longer fun and you start to feel harrassed then i would suggest to move on, some players handle PvP differently than others. Some get into rage mode with you just standing in their way some would find it interesting and play. To me if i slap somebody and they don't slap back i move on, i already know its not going to be fun so why waste my time. If you're RP'ng as a raider, try using raider lines from previous fallouts before you slap, i normally get really good reactions from it, from people yelling " oh no! He's gonna eat my spleen!" While running away and them turning around firing the 1st shots. 
---

---
" no need to run, I'll make it nice and easy. You can trust me" .... 
---
Thats how i find duals that last more than 5 minutes.  And i always use a weak non legendary revolver to make the shoot out last even longer, one hits end quick and gets old quick, along with the other player getting instantly discouraged to play again, not to mention the tendency that they may get salty and call you a cheating duper etc.
---
A lot of times the taunt emote is enough, if they respond with it i drop a bag with a single action revolver and a lever action along with ammo, then i pull mine out as soon as they pick up, 6 out of 10 they get it and equip. After we ran out of ammo shooting each other we thumbs up and i let them keep the stuff. I remember having a fight last for over an hour and none of us died not once but the hunt alone made it so much fun we ended up friending each other.  
---
I find it a lot more fun to PvP with friends, at least we know when to set up our camps for for it. We often play capture the loot, each team drops loot at the other teams base, which includes legendaries and flux. Defend the wooden shack and prevent them from taking the loot. While other team mates try to attack their shack and take the loot. This always ends up being fun unless you get a server disconnect. 
---
Just thought I'd share my thoughts on how to have fun with PvP without harassing others and being harassed yourself. 
---
Seriously it’s the most boring nuke zone I’ve ever been too.  :(
---
If you saw the Pink glow, and it was fuzzy, that was Berry Mentats...
---
You're telling me it wouldn't be better if *imagine* those who grinded a bit all got atleast 1. There would be people trading with each other to get the 1 mask they wanted. It would actually have created some continued excitement and for instance, I wanted the demon mask. It's the only 1 that I would possibly actually continue using. I could've used whatever I got be doing some trading to get something I actually I want and may use. Instead, we all have a whole bunch of masks that EVERYONE has every one, and for some people that's ok, because the mask they wanted is amongst those, but for others it's not. Those other masks may aswell be a fairytale, you'll never see opportunitys to get 1 and of you do, you'll have to sell your soul.

Helpful post from earlier this week.
---
Sorry I'm late, I actually Googled because I've been having this problem ever since I joined over a week ago or so.
---
I'm on Xbox as well. I would suggest trying to attach it vice versa, the converse way that you're currently. Instead of a to b, do b to a. Sometimes it works. Also yeah, exiting menu helps too. 
---
it requires stocking up on toxic goo (can loot it like you loot water from the pools of it at wes tek) which will apply radiation to you which will keep your health low.  So no perks needed for the damage side of things, could wear unyielding for more damage, or for most pve situations you can just throw on power armor and that will handle the damage reduction and youll still one shot just about every trash mob.
---
I would love to build at whitespring but I don’t like the idea of having to move or rebuild my camp every time someone nukes the place.
---
The workshops are supposed to put you into pvp with anyone trying to claim it, I get and understand that but if I'm not willing to defend said workshop from mobs the game makes the workshop unowned and I'm out of the running for pvp if someone tries to claim it.
---
If this is the case for mobs then why not for players?
---
Give me a quest and a timer to go to the defense of my workshop as soon as someone starts claiming it.
---
If I want to keep the workshop I will go defend it and probably die but, if I don't go to defend it before the times up, I lose it no questions asked.
---
Hell make my timer to defend way shorter than the claimant's timer to claim so I have to make a fast choice.
---
For everyone saying oh but I'm doing raider roleplay and that's why I go to a workshop, find you on the map, start claiming the workshop, then hunt me down. I call BS that ain't no raider roleplay that's griefer roleplay.
---
In a 'realistic' post-apocalyptic wasteland A raider finds a place and steals it. if someone shows up to defend it you kill them or die trying.
---
If no one shows up, then boom you own a new thing.
---
A raider doesn't use his magically GPS powers to find you on his tomtom, start stealing your stuff, and magically teleport to where you are to kill you on the other side of the world.
---
Yeah unfortunately it seems there are a lot of people who are not looking at the big picture of things or thinking ahead on the possible repercussions of things going this way. I can understand the idea of them being rare enough to be special enough that you don't see every other person with one. At the same time I don't agree with there being one mask per 10,000 people possibly making it so there's maybe a few dozen available in the economy. It doesn't have to be one extreme or the other. There is a middle ground to appease everyone that avoids the negative repercussions of having too many or too few masks.

Idk we will get one but I found an attack dog during a fight with the SBQ and it had a dog helmet like you could give Dogmeat.
---
The dog didn’t just have it btw. The dog dropped this helmet and I have it in my stash hoping to one day give it to a dog companion.
---
Thanks as always and sorry for the delayed response, resolving some homeowner issues (adulting sucks).

**1st:**

Can you PM me some details so I can replicated and report with details?

**2nd:**

Crept in a couple updates ago, I think they added that to stop the duping, but I'll report it. :)

Currency shouldn't be easy to come across, just my opinion. Not arguing with you either.

Unfortunately you need something to sell. I sell water and tatos, but I don’t have enough to clean them out....

Enjoy your downvotes.
---
I could see an event at hemlock holes. As they already have the grilling daily
---
Ok
---
Depends.  What esle you got going on?
---
Whenever it happened to me it's because the Flatwoods monster was nearby. 
---
Is there a list of poses in the bundle anywhere?
---
We've all been there at some point since Reclamation Day.  Go forth and tame that wasteland.
---
Just get rid of stuff. Don’t keep useless weapons and armour. Bulk and sell junk you don’t need. And keep a minimum of first aid supplies.....
---
I agree, especially when I have never used alcohol or chems in any fallout, now my character basically has to be a raging alcoholic at all times just to earn a few atoms, if I could either  
---
A. Get more atoms for my money  
---
B. Have rices dropped to make the atoms we do get more worthwhile  
---
I would definitely buy some atoms from the store, but as it stands its not worth it, and now atoms are getting harder and harder to earn
---
Hey I get Daily Toss if I go close to the Mount Blair Workshop. Maybe this helps
---
This is amazing, thanks! 
---
[removed]
---
I think someone has a mutation which does that, not sure which one tho 
---
I have not done BOS quest and can access every vendor. I did do Enclave event to get access to the Whitesprings bunker. The BOS quest kept hanging at the BMV. They would call my number and tell me to wait for my number to be called. Have no idea what I was doing wrong.
---
The whole point of the workshop is resources not farming players for caps.
---
Yeah months ago i found the glitch with the standard fasnacht mask. I ran around with the pompadour or green rags and no head for a few days 
---
Berry mentats.  Someone must have used one during the event.
---
Is there a limit on consoles?
---
Okay?
---
So potentially better items with onely 1 remaining?
---
what loot did u get? usually you would get stable flux and a decontamination shower plan
---
Well when you put it like that...
---
Idk, FO76 was fun when I was using my level 60 character but then it feels like it got boring just being that high of a level and not being able to die. Then I made this new character and it just felt like a never ending, not fun grind. 
---
I'm lower level. The last time I ran it I ended up with 5 levels, 8 stable flux and 4 items that benefited me. Other nuke zones I can barely keep up.
---
I figured this way, I can do the event and gather stuff. Two birds one stone type of deal. 
---
I hadn't eaten anything when it happened. Hadn't entered any menus, just finished fighting off super mutabns with my friend then looting what was left.
---
My carrying weight varies constantly.  No idea if I can fast travel from one minute to the next...
---
Haha, it was this
---
It literally tells you and shows you in the pictures in the atom shop....
---
It's mostly for the event, just makes it more interesting and beneficial. 
---
Where do we find the posters to start the quest? I can't even find those 
---
I play, I have fun, I get what I get. I think the event is great.  I also got a beret!
---
There was a preview when i clicked on it.
---
i always thought it was a texture glitch..super mutants are all glowing sometimes
---
Something like that and a legendary that was forgettable. 
---
Just so you know, you can lock the vending machine and fireplace so people have to pick them open and get a bounty for doing it, lol
---
Dont waste space in your camp with razorgrain. 
---
The homestead farm workshop on the western side of the map has a good 100 with Green Thumb. And the farm next to that has 100 corn. 
---
And it's all next to the river. Crafting 50 beers is super crazy easy. Not worth it really though other than the challenges. 
---
It’s a trick cheaters/griefers use to avoid reports, another common tactic is capital i’s right next to lower case L’s
---
Ex: lIllIIIlxXxMLGxXxlIlllIII
---
If you have weight reduction armor, when you get into PA it gets removed
---
That is just sad, yeah it makes sense if people were fighting for resources, but those are so easy to get like server hopping; it just bored people wanting to pvp in mostly pve game.
---
It’s old man winter! He has legs too stinking out. 
---
I unwisely tried to take on a relatively high bounty this morning and my 3\* Mole Miner Gauntlet didn't seem to register a hit at all at point blank range.
---
I genuinely don't believe he was doing anything untoward, because I did manage to get him down to 50% HP before I died, but I have no idea why multiple hits didn't seem to count.  I would have thought maybe it was Serendipity, but he had full HP.
---
You have to craft it.
---
Just start a new character. You can get to level 4 in like 30 min. 
---
I’ll give you a keycard
---
Solid proof is a picture of the drip no less. I'm tired of these random sightings being accepted as "evidence." We need a picture of the actual drop. Is it a coincidence that the 3 pictures of this mask in the wild have all been on the same outfit? Come on now. We are literally halfway through the event and not one single person can screenshot a drop? Get real people.
---
Ah sorry, I'm on PC so I got as much space as I allow it to have. I knew there was a limit on consoles, which makes sense, but I didnt think it was that bad.
---
I probably have 100 photos racked up that my loading screens cycle through. Not sure what the console limit is.
---
Ok thanks so much! Sometimes you don't get a preview when you click on it and you end up buying it without wanting to.
---
Yeah queen fight is a nice change from the usual grind make sure u drop your junk in the stash prior 
---
I will try this thank you 
---
You should get a gun that shots bullets not a melee for this purpose.. that’ll be your “tag” weapon. Therefore you can get the slightest chance of something good from the Mega* sloth ;)
---
I'm also not into the silly fad things.  I keep it if I like it, if not in goes into the blue suitcase at the train station. If it's something really good, I'll trade for something useful,  like a gun.
---
Removing my chameleon armor piece did not work, sadly. I don't have the mutation, so that couldn't be it. 
---
Just did event didn’t see a body. 
---
No worries at all. Sorry for the delay but I only got the chance to test it now
---
Only if you click on it though - for some items if you click on them, you end up buying them without a preview.
---
Lol, Bethesda knows you don’t work.
---
If only 
---
Its always two clicks to buy an item. No exceptions to it
---
Yeah love what you did with it. This is my camp atm. Wanted to give it a bit of a classy civilwar whitespring theme. http://imgur.com/gallery/DtwQAad
---
You guys always find stuff to whine about. 
---
If 76 was in an amazing position right now, with everything polished and working beautifully, I'd say sure.  Whatever.
---
But it's not, so you can imagine what I'd think if they said "We're working on a *third* new mode!"
---
It says in the description all the poses, and shows in the images all the poses.
---
Walking, waving, sitting, 2 thumbs up, ready (fists up ready to fight), heroic
---
If you want to look at individual poses more, you can look at them in the poses section.
---
Bug. Get in PA. Weights 335. Server hop and get 100 bonus. Exit armor and get back in. Lose that 100 bonus. Server hop and get it back. Has been that way for quite a while.
---
Some more rugs would be nice, too. Something colorful that would pop on those hardwoods.
---
Middle of the event not the week. The weekends is usually where things should get busy not die out on games.
---
"Get a load of this fancy lad and his fancy toilet! Oi, Trev! Get the rocket powered sledge! We're stealin' us a toilet!" 
---
Then they strapped it to a shopping trolley and went on a chem fueled rampage atop their porcelain throne. 
---
If you want the most damage you’ll want a Bloodied rifle, preferably with explosive as well. Downside 
---
Just play a game that’s actually good lol 
---
Same here.
---
I actually think it's kind of an ugly looking thing.
---
Tbh I think you are just trying to bend the rules of the game to suit your personal preference, stop complaining about players hunting you around the map. Take some personal responsibility and choose one of two options: don’t take workshops as they are a pvp arena or take workshops and expect pvp.
---
Ok that explains it
---
NukaCrypt.com 
---
server hopping did the trick, but not the way you would expect; the entire side mission changed its objective from agility to endurance, making me drink rad ant lager beer instead, while consuming spoiled food. 
---
I was lucky and got a bloodied lever off a sloth. It was only level 35, but it’s better than the max level 3* instigating lever I had before. 
---
It's so good. I wish it'd come back. The vtec 2 will be good too
---
Yep
---
Wow... are camp balloons poppable?
---
They need to make it so your character doesn't look like cricket 
---
Thanks for typing that out! I have a few places in mind already we could build at! We can definitely build something that blends will by building one story, and using AstroTurf on the roof if you have it! If not, I got some other ideas too, we can even build an enclosed garden in the center of your compound. And a central courtyard terrace for trading! anyway if you are working with a budget we can go more simple and let you do more of the decorating on your own, to keep the price down! Additionally if you supply us with 500 steel 500 wood and 100 concrete offer an even further reduced rate 
---
Vtec is ok. I never got that one 
---
I have to concur.  This is a major annoyance.  I have just about every single plan available including some atom shop CAMP items and the lack or bed diversity is top of the list.  Where are the sheets on that fancy bed!
---
Paint mine 😁
---
It really sucks having the workshops taken but at the end of the day that's part of the game. I had someone start taking my (lvl 19 at the time) workshop at sunshine (I always take it to farm Salisbury steaks) while I was just about done powering Poseidon up. Went back to take it back and the guy was level 120+ and easily 1 shot me off course. It's part of the game, move servers or do something else. 
---
But there is a big difference between taking workshops you want/need and being an absolute dick
---
I have leveled up three times while being intoxicated  several times, I just was intoxicated in real life not the game but still
---
Looks like a cozy cabin in the woods
---
Same here, the event makes me use 3 of my weapons. Cultist blade for the radtoads, lever action for the suiciders and shotgun for the sloth and wolves.
---
They actually do cross there but setting up in a way that it would actually work would be almost impossible since you couldn't test it. Have heard of people building grahm catchers to stop the vendor though.
---
Reload speed works. My dragon reloads in 4 minutes instead of 6......
---
Yes. I hope Bethesda is proud of themselves for the DMV quest. It is a long painful process. You weren't doing anything wrong, they just made it to be infuriating on purpose.
---
Haha, never thought of that! It would totally work I'm pretty sure.
---
I forget but its listed if you click on it.
---
Do pvp
---
I did it quite a few times. Won some, lost some. My instigator weapons helped a lot when I was attacked first, but all in all I didnt get much enjoyment out of it. I liked the PvE aspect better
---
You can scrap everything in your camp. If your stash is full the game has to store that junk somewhere, right? Can squeeze like 10 or 20 pounds of scrap abd food into that "full" stash box.
---
Lol, I was just messing with you, realistically the games been at rock bottom so the only way is up. I’m worried too, but we gotta keep the morale of the troops up. The trailer was pretty cool though. The sheepsqautch sounds cool, the vault raids seem interesting and the boyscouts seem like a new faction so the future seems bright. So far my only disappointment is the horn in the atom shop being an item you activate not a new instrument.
---
How do you know he wasn't looking for plans? Stimpacks? Various resources? I get your disappointment and frustration but just because he's level 100 doesn't mean he doesn't need things too. Cut your losses and switch servers and then he's gone. It's possible he was just trying to prey on some lowbies but when you have workshops you go into it understanding that any time any level player can come for it. 
---
Tru tru
---
Just follow the quests and enjoy the game. 
---
One thing for sure, if you fast travel a lot, you miss out on a lot of encounters and side quests. 
---
They could just make it a client side tracker... 
---
Forgot to mention I'm on PS4
---
Ive been farming this for a while. Only ran across one nuke there.
---
I don't take workshops
---
I'm not trying to bend the rules
---
The people who are being hunted when they aren't in the workshops are the ones saying stuff.
---
The people who go out of there way to use the game's systems to initiate pvp with a player who isn't at their workshop to stop them are the ones "bending the rules"
---
I'm Not talking about the people who actually want pvp and are fighting over workshops.
---
I'm talking about those people that look for owned workshops, then find you on the map, start to claim your workshop, then fast travel to your last known location to kill you. 
---
I've seen people say that they even watch you to see if you're loitering an area before they initiate a workshop claim.
---
The people Im talking about don't care about the workshop or what resources they can get from it.
---
They only want to kill you for whatever misguided reason they can find.
---
I can supply you with a ton of steel, wood and concrete. I also have some other creative trade ideas.
---
I would really like you to decorate it. I'd just put a milk carton and TV in there.
---
Are you going to be around tomorrow evening or afternoon? I'm pst. SkippyBoJangles is my Gt.
---
While you make a good point with your comments about people being nasty over the drop rates - there's no need to be nasty at all - I for one feel like you're coming off as a little too arrogant and holier-than-thou in trying to tell people what to enjoy and how to enjoy it.
---
There are plenty of us out there who like to collect stuff, and be completionists, and that's where we get our fun from. And, among this group there are plenty of those of us who have played loot games for the better part of two decades now, and who think that RNG without any catchup mechanics just downright sucks and is a lazy way of deciding who gets loot and who doesn't. The more extreme the RNG (and in this case, it seems to be somewhat extreme), the worse it gets. Then, on top of that, we're talking about an annual event that lasts only for a week. Saying "there's always next year" or something along those lines is more of an insult than a consolation to someone who didn't get those prized drops.
---
Plenty of games where this has been the case in the past, and plenty of people have voiced their opinion about how awful it is over the years, but here we are again, with yet another loot drop game doing yet another RNG lottery with fun drops.
---
Again, as much as I agree with the fact that people should be civil in giving their feedback, telling them what this event is "really about" is like telling them that what they like and how they like it is somehow wrong, and you are nobody to be doing that, any more than anyone else.
---
Wait, you *dont* sleep on a piss soaked mattress under an upside down bathtub?! What heresy is this?!
---
(Super sweet set up. Equally parts homely and imposing) 
---
Why not? Sign me up! 👍
---
1. He kept following me and my friends when we tried to leave the place.
---
2. He continously searched for a fight by charging towards me and my friends
---
3. he taunted me with emotes after I died
---
4. He took all the workshops i have claimed in a row and i could do nothing. reclaiming it or taking a new one, he took it. 
---
5. He also decided to trash my friends camp
---
It’s the journey mate. 
---
Oh! Just responded on Xbox, let’s move there! 
---
I’m 15 does that count? Also a Ps4 plaher
---
Imagine if bethesda added a animation to where you pull down your pants and use the john. Like a mini animation. Or you could just put the lid down and sit on top of the toilet instead of the nasty inside lid.
---
Completed the event 40+ times. Nothing. Haven't seen it. People on my friends list grind like crazy, haven't gotten it.
---
And just FYI. The people saying they saw a post about seeing it are referring to the same 1s. 3 days of events and 1 person has posted something themself (Twitter), 2 posts of people seeing some1 else (Reddit). That's it. And I think without a doubt 1 of them was from the dev room.
---
Hey are you there yet? It’s been a while?
---
"don’t take workshops as they are a pvp arena or take workshops and expect pvp."
---
I agree, what I'm saying is the "arena" should be the only place the can kill me I.E. INSIDE the workshop area.
---
Yeah he was a dick I would have just left server after the 2nd workshop and all that. People are dicks, what can ya do. 
---
I grinded the event on both of my characters to get the masks and plans. I’ve unlocked them all and have duplicates of the common masks and still no rare ones so I kinda just gave up. Especially as we only found out yesterday or so that the event rewards for the rare masks are broken 
---
You should stay gone. Something will go wrong and we'll have to listen to you complain. 
---
Or his wings!
---
Same boat but with shocks. I've been looking for a pair of X-01 Calibrated Shocks ever scene patch 5 with no luck until last night during the Fasnacht event I was able to find one for sale at the bunker. However I have a collection of five X-01 Jetpacks plus a lot of other mods for X-01 too. That's just the way luck runs around here. Now I want Blackbird PA skin to come back and then Life will be complete.
---
If you don’t kill her within the allotted time the event fails 
---
The whole point of workshops is pvp
---
Yep.
---
ah its ok, i appreaciate it !  theya re pretty rare it seems
---
Great site
---
The limit on console is 50 I believe. I know I hit the limit in the first few days of playing. It takes the fun out of it because every time I find something exciting to take a picture of... I end up having to delete something and usually end up missing my photo opportunity. 
---
I feel like they can easily implement by giving them out as a quest rewards for that daily hunting quest in the toxic valley
---
What about the times they detect you when you got max sneak perk card, really high stats due to unyielding, escape artist and your using a suppress weapon somehow the enemy detects you bs?
---
The meat pile will spawn, but always later after she disappears. It's not always in the same spot she died either but it'll always be around the area she fell. Sometimes in a laggy server it takes 20 mins.
---
CAMP plans for them are in the game files. Maybe they’ll come out with the Boy Scout quests.
---
This wasnt really a one time thing, I've dealt with the bugs and glitches of losing lots of materials, weapons, armor, etc. Died a few times by not being spawned in with my power armor at Whitesprings which is apparently a hotspot for nukes, random CTD's that take a bit to get the game going again, endless loading screens, etc. 
---
My skin's thicker than dealing with one small bug and going, "fuck it, never playing this game again." But at some point when you deal with lots of game breaking stuff for months you have to put it away for a bit and hope these problems get worked out later down the road. Like I said, loved the game and still like it, just wanted to see if things kind of straightened out or if it's still a buggy mess lol
---
That's a nice camp. It's like a resort.
---
They give you shop credit for free so you know how to use the store and can get some things. Then they gave you easy dailies when the game came out to get people engaged. Then the dailies became more and more far fetched to push you towards paying for atoms.
---
Deliberate tactic imo.
---
Damn. I got told.
---
Just go out and try to discover and explore every location on the map. Before you know it you’ll be level 100 
---
Oh hey, you don’t need the bonfire, do you?
---
Let them take their characters, just make it a one way trip.
---
Yesssss, this. They already exist as assets in-game at some of the lodges. Why can't we put them up in our house?
---
Genius :)
---
If it's ever re-released I would never buy another "limited edition" item in the ATOM shop. 
---
Im coming on rn whats ur gt?
---
A fine camp sir
---
Quests. I am around 155 and run Watoga, whitesprings (not just the golf club but the houses to the left as well), the steakhouse, and harpers ferry, for legendaries and that route gets me a level every other day.
---
Why don't we wait for Bethesda to announce Nuclear Winter and Detail it in full THEN tear it apart like survival. Maybe even jump to huge conclusions about it being broken before we even play it. 
---
I'm pretty sure that's how it works here.
---
go back to the camp and talk to the mr. handy that gave it to you originally, he'll giv you a new one free.
---
Why not both?
---
In a sense every time I return to my baseI have enough water to buy out a vendor, with ammo it would happen just as often.
---
Would you guys be willing to offer advice for already existing camps? I’ve got mine built atop the southern peak of Seneca Rocks, which obviously limits building potential. I do like the camp I have but a few things don’t feel right and I would love additional perspective.
---
Create a character for a 10 Atom challenge? How many atoms does a Camp item usually cost, 500/800? That's creating 50 or 80 new characters, for ONE cosmetic.
---
Say what you want, but we went from stuff like "kill 5 mirelurcks" to this, and now the best way to get a single daily challenge is creating a new character. And no dude, that's not ok.
---
Come take a tour and have a drink! Wish I could post photos on this sub!
---
Id imagine it’s DLC, it definitely sounds like there’s SOMETHING going on there.
---
anti armor perks do not work right now with energy weapons, staggering perks still do
---
I’ll Dm you a link!
---
Invite me in! GT: Ol Dirty gums 
---
you sir. have changed my mind. here . take my upvote 
---
Dude. Workshops are pvp. All you have to do is not take workshops and none of this would have happened, maybe the camp being destroyed but that's gonna change soon. I completely understand the frustration but you are doing a pvp activity. Have pacifist mode on, don't claim workshops and this will never happen. Instead of being mad, change the way you play the game so this type of thing doesnt happen. Ive got 400+ hours in the game and only taken 3 workshops. Im not interested in pvp within this game so i avoid it. 
---
I'm not sure.. I got one after about 20 events, but before a bunch of other random event plans
---
No
---
I agree. Id even be okay with likely purely cosmetic pets, like the ones in say (i dont have a lot of frames of reference I dont play a lot of online games) RuneScape, where they provide no combat benefits and do nothing but follow you everywhere.
---
Small idea for you because I think maybe you'll dig it - see how many CAMPs can be fit around Twin Lakes and build Lake House Condos?
---
So am I just supposed to scrounge the thousands of caps together to get plans?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Honestly, I just ignore those challenges. 
---
Is it really worth 10 points?
---
The game says you open yourself to pvp by claiming a workshop full stop,  no one has any right to complain about being hunted around the map when YOU/ or whoever claimed the workshop enabled that to happen. You should not be taking workshops as a pacifist player, if thats what you truly are... I’ve had so called pacifist players pull out a fatman and shoot it at me when I attack their workshop and proceed to abuse me in chat when i kill them, just because you or anyone else claims to be a pacifist player does not mean you are automatically the victim. Literally don’t know what else to say to you except I disagree with everthing you said.
---
Yup that’s fine, if you have a fighting spirit that’s all we need. I’ll DM you a link
---
Do you have the mounted flag plan?
---
When would you use a handmade and when a Lever-action one?
---
YES!?
---
I was just redoing my home(the booze got me bad)and was playing around with some rugs and mats and none really stood out for me. I'd love a long rug or even a nice throw rug for my Dark laminate floors.
---
Ooh and a welcome mat with flowers and stuff to match the astroturf
---
well, its a half truth. they fixed the speed glitch, but still, having uncapped frames with vsync off, while in power armor, mostly experienced indoors, you will get stuck unable to move if walking in power armor. to get unstuck you have to look upward and move. as if looking down and moving will clip you into the ground and get you stuck. or you have to find a way to reduce your max fps...
---
The event didn’t fail, we killed her well within the time
---
I don't think it'll work like that. I think it'll be like: here's some steel and wood and a legendary melee mod. Or, here's some steel and wood and oops nothing else. 
---
Maybe like the mutations in the Whitespring Bunker you can buy a plan to make unlimited legendary weapons of a type (two shot, anti armor, etc) but they will be very expensive (like 20,000 caps) and yes, you'll need rare junk like flux and ultracite to craft it. But that's it.
---
I have like seven Industrials and about 25 small water purifiers. So yeah, selling ammo would make it too easy. None of these people seem to understand that though.
---
Everyone nowadays wants everything handed to them in a video game. If dev's listened to people that commented on this post, the game would get boring after 3 days.
---
hi i do have an extra  one of them on my character :)
---
No u mean like, the event literally kicked me out, it didn’t fail. The scortchbeast queen was there dead, but her inventory was empty, everyone else got their rewards
---
That’s awesome! I found Jeff’s 1st  holotape but thought he was just crazily talking about the mothman... sweet I’ve always hoped there’d be stories like this to follow up on 
---
Platform?
---
I'm pretty sure I have three total.  At least two.  Either way you're in luck.
---
I'm almost at my max on caps, but some stable flux for crafting things would be nice...
---
Lol, no the whole point is resources, pvp is there so people can fight for control of the resources.
---
Was it a legendary?? :o If you're on Xbox, I can craft them. 
---
Yes
---
Easy. I usually run to the overseer camp,checkpoint there,run to flatwood. You should level up when you first enlist as a responder(terminal), and then when you contact them at the end of the second quest.
---
The alchol: there is some in the bus close to the wood factory(just south of vault).
---
I usually just buy it from the vendor in the church. 
---
This works great for 2 levels,the third can be done killing stuff and the event "fertile soil".
---
Thanks! 
---
You can tame a dog or a mongrel but they just stay at your camp
---
YES please. The hair right now is awful. The only one I like just makes my character look like Nora from Fallout 4, and I really would like a different look since I played that game for 2000+ hours lol
---
Pretty much anywhere a magazine spawns u just got lucky
---
Word. I JUST got Hoppy Hunter IPA this morning so I made a few extra for my friends to be able to do the challenge. Idk how they would’ve otherwise. :/
---
XB1 
---
I like it! The highth is impressive 
---
The first day was and actually my first time running the event was the most active when it came to communication. I had a blast and I’m thankful for the cool folks on that first run. I have attempted to pep up the crowd in some of my yo no avail. Regardless, I try to have a good time on my own. 
---
Thanks....omw
---
Those were removed in the most recent update
---
Thanks, it definitely has that feel
---
It seems like Bethesda are promoting drinking a little too much. I understand that the brewing workstation is their biggest achievement so far but they could’ve done something more meaningful.
---
Quackhorse71678
---
That happened to me with the junkyard last night. Was seriously disappointed to find scorched!
---
i think its inherited from fo4 where most clothing items removed your armor (only the "underarmor" pieces didnt - like vault suit and road leathers etc...)
---
i wish they didn't have this bug cuz they look good...
---
Dawg that’s one of my favorite lines
---
bit shit tbh
---
I've been watching Beth Roars lately.  Check out her video on Iron Maiden if you haven't yet done so.  She's so positive and genuine in her enjoyment of different takes on vocals, while still explaining what's going on in them.
---
I’ll be there in a minute
---
Nice, Im glad you like it
---
If I'm not clear I'm sorry, what I'm trying to say is;
---
If you own a workshop and it gets attacked by scorch, you get a quest and a timer to go to the defense. If you aren't in the workshop area by the time the timer ends the workshop becomes unowned.
---
Why can't this system be put into place for players?
---
If someone is claiming the workshop, you get a quest and a timer. If you aren't in the workshop when the timer ends they get the workshop.
---
I used to just post a link, but I always got people asking for the text. Because Reddit didn’t work on the company firewall
---
Well so far it’s just you buddy. I’m thinking logically. 
---
I feel your pain with the combat armor since I'm currently trying to save the caps for the heavy plans, but marine armor plans can be found in Harper's Ferry for free. They just take some server hopping. I suggest looking up the youtube video for it since it's not just the marine plans you can find in that spot, I've found the plans for the heavy robot limbs in the process too.
---
Saw one this morning
---
I got like three of them, and i did the event like 10 times. Gave one to a friend, holding the third for another friend.
---
Great I’ll trade balloons to you I’ll double check to make sure I still have
---
Right above you, 3 downvotes, pay attention, buddy.
---
I got the plans how much u offer
---
Aye it didn't tag, yeah I see your point. I'm not sure if that happened to me or not, but had some really laggy events where she disappeared before the rotating circle stopped.
---
As a matter of fact it's all of your comments.
---
And let's not forget those **weekly challenges-inside weekly challenges**, i mean they are ridiculous hard and tedious to do for the amount of atoms they provide.
---
Bethesda themselves have stated otherwise but ok, you just know better. Got it
---
I went through there and agree. Definitely seems like there is more to it.
---
C/users/you/documents/my games/fallout 76. There should be a fallout76custom.ini file in there that didn't get removed.
---
I had my fill with one event. I mean it was fun and I'm glad they made the event, it's a memory for me now, that's it.
---
All Reddit told me was that you commented. I wanted to be sure you got an answer
---
how about $200 caps?
---
How does that work exactly anyways? You can’t just drink some Whiskey before you go into the pip-boy and level up? You have to actually be intoxicated when you get the level up message? 
---
I was so confused trying to do that challenge today, I am just getting into the game though. 
---
Yes. Or trade for them. Or find them throught out the world. Or do events. 
---
Yup. But do you really care if you are?
---
Drink the wine then it will tell you
---
I was pushing daily challenges before Wild Appalachia started, but really I can't be bothered to do the new dailies. They were fine and balanced before I think. I'm just wait to see if these are just limited time and they'll revert back to normal here pretty soon? Yeah the work is just too much for the amount of atoms you get.
---
ty
---
Yea sure 
---
It's a fun location to run through. But yeah, definitely seems like a location that's gonna have some DLC attached to it in the future. 
---
I need some where new to dance.
---
I have a spare I added you :)
---
It does not become unowned
---
If the guy was knocked out by the blast.... it was me hope you had fun hehe
---
Not really. Unless they are genuinely upset then I sort of feel bad for it
---
I dont do it anymore.  Really not worth it.  But i do have 500 ultracite plans if you are interested.
---
Sorry....world full
---
No you don't, you just need to build a fusion generator which is pretty cheap if you have the contractor perk.
---
If you’ve ever seen the Prize Bot, it’s basically that but meaner and without a prize.
---
...Not those kind of poles... but hey, to each their own
---
yeah. i know what you are talking about. it got better with the last patch but it's still happening sometimes. i am not sure if this is also related to the multifaction issue i described in my post. it might be that enemies are able to detect you through the vision of other entities, like other players etc.
---
i would be happy if they at least fix the sneak attack. after this we can try to figure out the rest of the broken stealth system ...
---
Wtf that doesn’t make him a griefer. 
---
Lol if he were to follow that person around and continue to provoke him and damage him, if he went to his base and destroyed his shit for no reason, then he would be one. 
---
He just cleared a bounty on someone’s head, regardless of how they received that status. That’s not griefing at all. 
---
ok great!!!!!! psn id is FritoZ
---
When I claimed a workshop I got the "go to its defense" quest i ignored it and the timer counted down.
---
Then I got a quest to go reclaim it.
---
I looked on the map and it no longer said I owned it. It said 'unowned' i had to repay to claim it once more.
---
Unless this has changed since I last took a workshop.
---
A simple braid hairstyle would be great, and practical for the apocalypse, too. Getting tired of my original cut, but there aren't any others I like. Maybe adding a Style pack to the atom shop would be good? I'm sure enough people would buy it, and if they made different ones, you can get packs to suit your character. E.g. Punk pack, Fashionista pack, Greaser pack, or even some seasonal style packs.
---
Worlds full I hope y’all shred her 
---
Iguana bob.
---
I did it earlier on PS4, it was really fun and made the event interesting!
---
Nah man, they're wanted. They'll probably loose like 5caps. If I see a low LVL wanted, I'll go to kill them to get the numbers for the challenge. Happened to me when I was low LVL, I didn't care to loose like 5 caps as long as you don't take their loot.
---
I've done the event about six times now, as much as I physically am able to with working every day, and I've yet to even see the sloth as a living creature. It's always dead within a second of spawning. It's the one thing I find a touch annoying about this really fun event, the super high level people just one shot this thing before the rest can even look at it. 
---
Thank you 🙏. I was sort of unsure whether or not people considered that griefing because I recently saw some people doing the faschnat parade event that were wanted so I went a killed all of them and they said I was toxic. So I guess it’s how you see it. I don’t see it as griefing I just wanted to know if anyone did
---
People knew the game was broken before release, they talked about it and they were right. Now it is the same thing. If you need time to finish your job you don’t just start selling and telling people to be patient.
---
I don't remember them being blank. There's a whole thing about it being a scientific project annexed by the government to potentially aid in the war - it's &gt;!a weather control device!&lt;.
---
Apparently sheets were the first things to go in the apocalypse.
---
Tesla gets boosted by rifle skills at least.
---
which wine?  I was not provided any. 
---
So, not worth reinstalling yet?
---
🤷🏻‍♂️
---
If you don’t like the light from your pipboy, equip a mining helmet and your flashlight will be like that of a power armor’s headlamp. It’s customizable too!
---
They do work with plasma. At least the pistol/ rifle. 
---
I’m talking about the duper characters from before the weight limit and when duping was big. People had characters with millions of pounds of weight and dupes of every item in the game.
---
And yes at one point Bethesda made all the duper items not stack and thus made their server impact much greater.
---
Just learn to enjoy playing the game folks.
---
You gotta go get some wine! 
---
Don’t get me wrong there’s a huge difference between being a griefer and playing within the bounds of the game. Some people forget the trophies, perks, and abilities that reward pvp actions. 
---
it is perfectly reasonable to not agree with me, we are all our own humans with our own opinions.
---
Thanks for checking out what I had to say and putting in your two cents.🙂
---
Well the thing is it is also if someone accidentally hits me and it gives me the option to fight back too
---
Now I want a giant sloth head mount!
---
Seems one sided if your loaded with caps. 
---
I’m hoping it’s simple. 1* for 1* and a chance at a 2*. And so on. Maybe with a timer to prevent spam. 
---
Had no idea! Thanks for the info
---
You can make it with the recipe you unlocked. Or the easier method buy it from a vendor or find it at the bar in whitesprings
---
I need this more than my irl body needs air.
---
Fast travel to Helvetia for free and it will be fixed immediately.
---
Mmm, I wouldn't do it in that case. Or if they were running around do an event with me or just like hanging out a group of people. I would only go after someone I see on the map.
---
theyre not holding block the bot signs. fail.
---
Corpse / meatpile loot is instanced per player. You may now cease feeling bad.
---
Not if they balanced the economy properly instead of the abomination we have now.
---
K got it
---
Check the market on reddit for a crafter or seller. Supply drops often have one. And the vendors will as well. I know your pain. Way back when I lost my TSE and got a new one like two weeks ago. 
---
Added you my psn is girlscoutcookiej 
---
I popped the balloon at a friends base and became wanted :(
---
after he killed me and i respawned i repaired it for him :)
---
Awesome! I have some flux. Is there a particular kind you need? 
---
Like.. 5 people out of about 16 got that on my first parade run just after it launched. Im not convinced it's all that rare..
---
Lol first thing I though of. 
---
The chance of finding a two shot explosive weapon is very very very very very very low, as 95% of legendaries are complete bullshit and 98% of the time the items are not even worth picking up. The remaining 2% of legendary weapons are usually a one or two star legendary, and getting a good 3 star legendary is extremely rare (I only got three good 3 star legendary weapons in all the time I've played \[currently level 120\] - a 3 star troubleshooter's VATS Enhanced (+33% VATS hit chance) 15% faster reload 10mm pistol, 3 star anti armor 90% reduced weight reflects 50% of melee damage back while blocking gronkak's axe and 3 star instigating 10% more damage while aiming assault rifle with the 3rd effect that I don't remember). The closest weapons to the two shot explosive effect I have got are a ghoul slayer's explosive hunting rifle, two shot M79 grenade launcher, two shot 10mm SMG, two shot pump action shotgun and some other weapons. You might think that TSE weapons never even appear in legendary enemies' loot lists, but this guy got an instigating explosive pump action shotgun once while farming uranium fever, so there is a chance to TSE weapons to spawn. He was so lucky as well because he got that shotgun before the TSE nerf patch, and was just one shoting most of the enemies (to take down a level 50 scorchbeast it took him two shots with the shotgun)
---
But just so you know, when you see a player with TSE handmade, shotgun or combat rifle and you think: "Damn, where did this guy get that TSE?" you are thinking wrong because there is a high chance that the player bought the TSE weapon(s) from the Fallout 76 armory on the internet, where you buy TSE weapons for real money. Luckily, the TSE weapons are pretty expensive for in-game weapons, costing about 30 dollars each. Here is the link if you are interested: [https://www.g2g.com/fallout-76/item-25467-25473?sorting=seller%40desc&amp;item\_type=29715](https://www.g2g.com/fallout-76/item-25467-25473?sorting=seller%40desc&amp;item_type=29715)
---
Thx
---
At the same time when an enemies name turns red I just don’t trust them not to kill me. Earlier a whole team got marked as an enemy by accident and I accidentally killed one of them. The other 2 were in pacifist mode so I decided to not kill them. I was in front of one of them, then he turned off pacifist mode just to kill me. So then I ended up coming back and killing them both.
---
What do you have in luck now? If you have both 4 leaf and crit savy, drop the former. 
---
I love how you took the time to write this post out, Welcome to this new digital age we live in. I'm glad you understand how the world works now.
---
No got if first try 
---
I can craft them on Xbox. 
---
Wow man, you really seem to care too much about all this. 
---
The best one so far. I want the goblin..
---
My experience has been that there is one 'hard', one 'easy' and the other 3 are moderate difficulty. You always get one that is level once or take a picture while X, then you get one that is level 3 times while drunk or similar difficulty, and the other 3 range in the middle. I can always get 1, and if I have a bit of time 4/5 pretty regularly. 
---
I was gonna make a post about this place. 
---
It’s an observatory that is actually an American weather manipulation machine...and it works. But a few days before the bombs there is a direct order from the top to shut it all down.
---
The head scientist didn’t want to quit, even working beyond when the bombs dropped. He says he activated bots to help him. But why are all the bots Liberators? In a secret American military base.
---
Looking forward to find out more.
---
I've just been skipping dailies/weeklies because they're too tedious or are literally impossible. Like even that craft 50 alcohol one. I don't wanna do that, Bethesda, pls.
---
Ah I see. I've just never really used my excavator PA. Always had better armor protection wise and carry weight hasn't ever really been much of an issue until lately. That's interesting though. Seems like something they would want to fix soon...
---
Sounds about right. Lol
---
Three runs last night alone....three owl masks. Should be on tonight and willing to trade two of them for masks or plans from Faschnacht if anyone needs one.
---
Especially looking for the decorated door plan and the bonfire plans.
---
ParzAttacks on PS4
---
I would like to join
---
Nope, they dropped the ball, How the hell they didn't make a female robobrain (like every single other one) and called it Bev, I'll never know.
---
Kidding aside, he is a great character. Love his dialogue.
---
friend request approved :)
---
I’d say 4 leaf clover is better than the other perk. You don’t need both or it is redundant 
---
Okay! I’ll dm you a link
---
I see. I think it's a big though. Someone else seems to have also had this happen
---
Thanks again! A+++ Transaction:)
---
I'm coming
---
Not for the Gatling plasma from my playtime
---
It's a stupid but funny effect on a gamma gun cause it's meant to kill ghouls but the radiation just heals them
---
yeah I run a similar build and was looking for ways to boost my ap regen during queen raids. that sounds pretty promising though so maybe I'll look into it
---
I see. Thanks for the info!
---
Nice job man. I’m not on PS4 but nice job 👍. Some people just take the game too seriously.  
---
I wanna make a new boi and experience the paranoia of being killed at every corner, so yes.
---
Try the banks of the old somerville lake.
---
Sell or trade it to other players.
---
Found mine at the random spawn travelling vendor bot near Charleston station. Don't remember how much.
---
As long as we're confessing. I'm the one who went to work today ate some really bad burritos and didn't flush the toilet. 
---
WHERE DO I FIND WINE 
---
Can i say it if I give you my big kahuna burger?
---
You get an event to retake a workshop which means you just kill the mobs that are there.  It’s been that way at least since New Years when I started.
---
Yeah I know what you mean dude, it really sucks. Whenever I'm fighting a three star legendary ghoul at the whitesprings (best farming location), I'm expecting to get a three star OP legendary weapon, but instead I get a crappy one star exterminator's armor chest piece, and just pick it up to sell for like 5 caps for my benefit and to get rid of the embarrassingly weak legendary gear. 95% of the legendary gear is complete bullshit and 98% it's not even worth picking. Honestly, Fallout 76 is a good game and I respect it, but Bethesda really needs to fix this shit legendary gear. 
---
Holy shit lol just buy it from Tannin ya goof
---
Well, I definitely haven't taken a workshop since then, so I stand corrected.
---
Thanks for the knowledge!
---
Tbh the idea of scrapping it is valid.
---
Yeah rolling pins are probs the worst weapon in the history of fallout and cannot benefit from any legendary effects. They actual fucking suck
---
I’ll test again. But my old rifle did. Wasn’t too noticeable but it was there. 
---
Personally, I'm not a fan of the mix of colors that the Brotherhood had in Fallout, what with the paintless metal and ugly green for the PA, with some red decals, and then the Brotherhood blue hood.
---
However, the combination of paintless steel, Brotherhood blue and black would be awesome. Basically, [the colors of their logo](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/4/4d/BoS_logo.png), with no green and red in the mix. Brotherhood blue and unpainted steel for the main colors with black decals, or at least black decal outlines, if using this logo.
---
I made a new character who serves as an extended stash box
---
That's not the problem we're addressing at the moment
---
That’s where I got mine! I paid 300 - 700 caps for it, although I don’t recall the exact number. 
---
Yeah i agree the bethesda really needs to fix this shit legendary gear
---
ah shit. I thought it had to be special wine. idk i’m dumb. 
---
I guess their analytics are telling them players are accumulating a large amount of Atoms and this is done intentionally. Just a theory. I've banked over 5k+ by running my daily and weeklies. But I do agree the craft/drink 50+ beverages or kill X with X drink (that you usually don't have because Biv is very buggy) is quite irritating.
---
Why do the medical vendors Sell packs of smokes if I can't even 'use' them?
---
Lemme Spark up BETHESDA!
---
Sure they did.
---
fucking rolling pins
---
1300+ likes. 
---
Nice. 
---
I'm not really keen on explaining my tricks but you won't be the first person to call bullshit on my statements in this topic, and the previous guy that talked builds retracted their 'its BS' statement.
---
um i didnt see the ballons plans in there? am i missing somethign?
---
No, they made lights and turrets take less budget though
---
That’s the weird part though, it’s not during an event. A guy was stabbing me at the overseers camp and it was doing nothing. It was really strange. 
---
I am not going to touch survival with my character. He's going to be purely PVE on pacifist after this.
---
What level are you?
---
Damn man if that is all they did then it really increased the amount of stuff you can build just from that change
---
OMEGALUL Anybody who makes suggestions or gives feedback can drop fucking dead I agree :)
---
I always drop my unused ammo at the stations in front of the vendors. So when you are there, check for a paper bag! 
---
Why can't I open a pip-boy and play some pip boy games while im sitting or laying down for that matter?
---
No my dear friend I said that any game created with a shitty connection in mind would be improved with a better one. 
---
That's awesome lol. Haven't seen Prize Bot in a while. Used to see him all the time when the game launched. 
---
Lmao. Buy it. Pretend the vendors are your own personal liquor store. Then keep one of each bev on you at all times for Biv’s quests :)
---
Ok man.
---
It actually made the event really fun!
---
Power armor sucks for pvp. Just go nude next time 
---
True, but Heveltia didn't have events up until now. So adding this one was easy. They'd have to relocate that daily to make room for it. The Hotdog stand might be a more likely choice.
---
I love the idea of Players using the polling booths for voting on things... but not on any major development decisions.  If I've learned anything, it's that this subreddit does not represent the average player, and I trust the devs more than the masses to make the major decisions.  Let us vote on in-game event related stuff, fun stuff.
---
I'm proud of you, son
---
Every time there's a new patch, there's potential for instability. 
---
You come across as one of the people who likes to come here and rant about how Bethesda is intentionally screwing us. 
---
Meanwhile, lots of people have been online enjoying the game every day since you left. 
---
You're welcome to come back. I'll even gift you some legendary stuff. 
---
But you have to promise that if you leave again, you'll go quietly, without any drama. 
---
They kinda have that with the one u gain 15% more exp in a group. I forget the name
---
doesn't look like I have an extra, but if I get one in the next couple days I'll let you know.
---
TheMeiserVader
---
Bethesda said all masks are avalable just rare 
---
Check the level 3 safe on the left hand side of the Enclave vault entrance , I've had a few spawn there.
---
Yeah but, they can shoot you and turn aggressive, but still do no dmg to you if your pacifist is off. So that becomes just an excuse. If you're not in any threat than you have no real reason to attack, other than you want to
---
He quickly turned pacifist off to kill me for some reason
---
If anyone knows the same for nukashine I'd love to know.
---
Nah.
---
Make it a cigar and you're on point.
---
I’d love it if you and another close person could both communicate with them. And give a XP buff.
---
Better yet I’m surprised that no one has managed to play Africa by Toto
---
I want to use flatwoods monsters head as fish bowl. 
---
He spawns right next to charleston right?
---
Oh no... 3 while downvotes whatever will I do? Look, twat, I’ve been on reddit like 40 days, don’t even know what the fuck Khama is, yet I have over 4000. You’ve been here 64 days and you ain’t got shit lol. 
---
Good news is that both Bethesda messages and datamined content suggest you will be granted your requests
---
Forgot to add, there was a vendor bot but i could only interact with him i couldnt trade
---
Took me 100+ hops to get the civil war plans
---
I am a little surprised because usually these kind of posts get ripped to shreds. 
---
Of course numbers only matter when it’s “Everyone thinks (something negative)
---
But when the numbers are people who like something the larger, that doesn’t count.
---
Still I’m really so happy to see people are more positive about the event.
---
People exploiting weaknesses in Bethesda’s code I feel ya I got one shot in passive outside my house wasn’t in a team didn’t fight back I was afk hell I wasn’t sure what happened till I recorded last 4 mins and watched back
---
It's not about the votes, it's about showing that your opinion is bad.
---
Imagine the G.E.C.K has began side a human, and you see a centipede creature that steals faces.
---
Biv, the beloved frat-bot. 
---
someone in the Area likely ate Berry mentats, it's part of the Bugged PA hud effect, it's spreading to other surrounding players and NPCs
---
Not that rare 
---
I always start off my play by sleeping to get the well rested 5% xp bonus  stays active for 2 hours , craft and eat cranberry cobbler which gives 5% xp bonus for 30 mins, and craft and eat cranberry relish that gives 10% xp bouns, then do your grinds, whitesprings, west tek, harpers ferry, events...
---
Lol I wish I was skilled enough to do such a thing, the instruments are cool but it would have been a lot cooler to enable players to choose what notes their gonna play, maybe like the Zelda games or perhaps you could make the note sheet and when you enter an instrument you can pick a certain tune to play(from your pool of sheet music), then you could make versions for other instruments and link them so when you begin as the group leader the others will follow in with their alternate sheet. 
---
Little to in depth for this game but we are supposedly the brightest minds in America when we enter so I’m sure lore wise it would make sense.
---
Watch your account get suspended, or your rights to participate on this sub get removed now. Keep calling folks names cause you're mad on the internet. 
---
yeah, i also just came back to the game and started experiencing this issue. i set my fps limit to 118 (below my refresh rate) and it seems to have fixed my problem.
---
Dlc could add anything. 
---
Just because an enemy is 3* does not guarantee that it will drop 3* gear. I had one instance where I hit the Queen and she dropped nothing, but i only got a couple of shots on her before she was killed, so that might be why. And that was the tenth time killing her,  and every time beforw that I got gear and plans. 
---
Ever since the distillery update, all new content (map markers, doors, NPCs etc) takes ages to load.
---
You might find this of interest. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0o6ly/luck_critical_perks_and_diminishing_returns/
---
It’s a spawn location in the Watoga Appalachian Antiques not guaranteed but not too rare either 
---
So you shot them accidentally, and then they turned off pacifist and began shoot at you? And you killed them, that's just PVP.
---
Ok just wondering I found mine at the ranger district office 
---
A furious chainsaw would be stupid good. 
---
Read patch notes. Don't remember which patch they brought it up but it would be pretty easy for you to find yourself
---
But it really doesn't seem like you're at all interested in anything but your own opinion so believe whatever you like. Im out
---
“Stop being so salty, it tells you you are entering pvp when you take a workshop.  Lol get good” and so forth....
---
Ah no it’s fine, those two are the only spawn locations for them behind the desk at Ranger District Office and In a shelf in Appalachian Antique’s
---
And since duping ain't big nowadays and dupers don't dupe big no more, it's these hoarders that are impacting the server harder. 
---
I see. I saw it and I was like well that’s something I haven’t seen before
---
Really reminds me of Paladin Danse 
---
I meant seen in 76
---
Yes I know but it reminds me of him.
---
UPDATE: There is a P.O. Box at the Clarksburg post office that does need a key. I just find it odd that the key and tape just appeared. My C.A.M.P has been by Grafton since a month after launch and I walk the road almost every day and I’m pretty sure that key was added today. I think the KEY, holo and the vault are apart of the sheepsquatch quest line. 
---
I’d do that- I picked up an extra giant mask and should be on around that time tonight. Pm me your ign and I’ll add you
---
I wasn’t refuring to settlements on this point he was and your correct about pvp only advice I can say is keep patient pvp servers coming soon and this shouldn’t be a major issue like it is now
---
Haha Build the tenpenny tower of  West Virginia 
---
Lol I just want the donut recipe
---
But if we can't make assumptions who will we know to witch hunt?!?! Lunacy I tell you
---
Probably using a bloodied build with Adrina reaction, nerd rage, bloody mess and all weapon damage cards maxed out. With a meta weapons these builds do upwards of 400-700 damage per shot. Unless you have 15 endurance or full assassins sentinel they will probably one shot you. 
---
Where’s the ranger district office?
---
Smokey runs them regularly on xbox. We teamed up tonight and split the work. Many show up but not many launch. Or launch quick.
---
In CranBerry Bog above the Drop Site G3
---
Oh, Pete just flew into this town!
---
Check the vendors
---
This is a lie. I'm always getting attacked by scorchbeast when I'm running in the Mire and Cranberry Bog
---
more like "While you're out getting milk and bread, go build a new car from the ground up"
---
Which is exactly why I won’t be bothering with survival mode. 
---
Thanks, will add it to my daily travel routine.
---
I mean, I feel for you but it's an expansion based around moonshine and home-brewing... I don't know what you expect
---
Of course
---
Ok. Tried morgantown.  No ammo.  Gotta travel I guess.  Sigh
---
If only The Silver Shroud was around to help...
---
Being of that &gt;100 level myself, I would guess boredom is a factor. I love the buulding aspect of this game. If I didnt, I cant imagine what I would 
---
Super mutants might have. If you have scrounder, loot and check every ammo box around
---
Between the one at the airport and train station they should have some. If nothing else find a tinkers bench and make some. 
---
Wasn’t refuring to selling
---
Every time i get a type that i can't make i immediately go "this will probably be useful for biv in a couple days" ahd stash it. Rodgers reserve I've got 1 bottle sitting. Waiting. 
---
It is Friday, not the middle of the week. 
---
You could make at the tinkerers workbench, where you power up steel heart
---
Everyone has. Longest the servers have been up since Wild Appalachia at once is about 5 hours, to the best of my knowledge. 
---
I just rebooted fo76 since the update... I've just realized my camp is a mess... I accepted an invitation and all of a sudden... I had lots of pipboy cutouts outside my camp... Appalachia has changed.. had one inside my toilet... please give me a sanitary camp !!
---
Also let others tag the mobs as well. 
---
I figured that is probably the case, but I've been grinding out magazines for the last few days trying to find all of them and not only is that the only spot I found a game, but to find 3 of them in pretty short order made it stand out, so might be worth a try for others as well. 
---
Ohh, I understand now. Thank you for explaining it for me.
---
Yeah, man, I used to do every daily every day. Then I realized I was only getting like 50 cents in real world value for 3 hours of my time. I said fuck that and haven’t looked back. It’s especially shitty that they still haven’t fixed existing “challenges” since launch, like discovering locations, bobble heads, etc.
---
Thanks. Forgot I could simply make it lol.  
---
Np
---
This sub's opinions on changes (not new features, we get good ideas there) is obnoxiously bad. 
---
On top of that they think because they bought and have played the game it somehow makes their "opinions" (regurgitated YouTube trash) valid, or worthwhile. 
---
It's like saying "I bought a Chevy Silverado, and it's great.... But you should change how the engine works..... What's that? No I'm not a mechanic, or an engineer, nor have any experience in the automotive field....but I own a truck so I know what's best."
---
RobertoMaietta
---
I also thought this after I saw how the fermenter worked, there's to hoping for the future!
---
Certainly could be, I guess.  I just found it odd that I wouldn't hear even a contact noise, if that was the case.  It was like I was swiping at air, so I'm tempted to say it was latency or something.
---
Feedback on changes and shouting disapproval over things for which few details have been revealed and they have not played are entirely different.
---
Man I completely bugged out in the last fight, my stamina wasn’t recharging for most of it and all the enemies were invisible to me T.T 
---
At least you can get in it.  I cant access the menu to the tinker bench which means no ammo.
---
Just farm the vendor bot responder. 
---
What I would really like is to being able to display whatever pieces of armor I have over my costume, and pick witch ones to hide and witch ones to show. That way I'd be able to wear my civil war era suit or civil was dress with armor on top to give it that steampunk vibe the civil war era items give.
---
I feel like this was a part of the missing boy questline. At wavy Willard's. Slither slide, that's the slide you climb during the quest, and I remember get a something from a PO box in Grafton
---
What platform are you on? I've got one that I really don't care about.
---
No soarch beast also drop them but it's rare.  You can farm them and get plans for  them. 
---
Hopefully instruments get some love.
---
That'll be $5 please
---
I wholeheartedly agree. I have been trying to find a certain location (not on map) I found really early in the game and now can't find it. I would like to find this place again as it is a really good camp location. 
---
I dont like current mechanics but I wouldn't attempt to change stuff by starting from drop rates. I think the best way to farm gear is reliable gear. There will be weekly named item, you'll be given set of tasks to complete to obtain it, and I think its the best road.
---
Currently, your chances for obtaining perfect gear from the ass of a 3 star cricket are just as big as from the endgame boss. I think its nonsense and I think players should be able to craft whatever gear their want and to wear crafted items that are perfect rolls for their build, but they should put some solid hours to achieve that.
---
The key difference is reliability. There is little you can do now to influence the results, and that my sir does suck.
---
with 200 caps per day per vender type this does not matter
---
Added.  Now comes the come across each other online part.
---
It's just a game dude. Don't get all up in it like that.
---
Low drop rate headwear
---
Totally agree.
---
Also, when it comes to things like this it would be nice if they could break up the challenges a bit, like the main goal is to level up three times for 30 atoms, but leveling up once would still give you 10 atoms.
---
The only unfortunate thing about Uranium Fever is that the legendaries are capped at level 40 by the mole miners. If it was 50, it'd be perfect. Still a good run, obviously.
---
Haha! Join my server and fast travel to me :$
---
Yeah I mean. I decided not to kill them but they still turned on me. So I can’t trust anyone that is marked as an enemy
---
Lucky hole mine and a quick run around HTS3 netted 500 Lead Ore and about 130 Iron Ore (I need to learn all the iron ore nodes in HTS3...).
---
Ended up with around 380 iron and 1650 lead thanks to super duper. :)  Iron is easy to come by though... just grab weapons and scrap them...
---
Greed, greed never changes.
---
me too
---
Maybe minus the murder in the basement ;)
---
These would actually be worthwhile rare drops for cryptids, plans for their mounted heads, seeing as how currently they don't really drop anything unique beyond junk.
---
Agree 100%.
---
Maybe they were worried about getting a trademark lawsuit by ABINBev? Still, they should have tried.
---
I think the event is well balanced and is more about having fun together regardless of level and Fasnacht does exactly that...it brings players together. The last time I saw this many people in one place was launch day. I love it and I really hope Bethesda takes note of this and makes similarly styled Events and possibly reworks the older ones to encourage player interaction! :)
---
At least one Crimson for a quest I'm on.  Other than that, it'd be nice to have some of each kind just to have around.  I'm in a generous mood today so I'll just let you pay with whatever stable flux you feel is fair.
---
Online now.  Deathknell1972.
---
He doesn’t always spawn in the trees. I thought he did but out of maybe 14 times I’ve run the event he has spawned near the bonfire twice. Not sure if it’s a glitch or he’s meant to occasionally spawn over there but he definitely can. 
---
It would be neat if they told people your kill count for that mob when they looked at it too. 
---
Yeah... i think we burned that server. First 2 went well,  the last was bad and lag. 
---
I always make sure i bring a stimpack with your name on it lol
---
It would be nice to more CAMP love. As well as things like a greenhouse building set, crop plots, fridges, stairs, etc :D
---
It's been like 4months and we only just got a radio that plays the radio station that people actually want. 
---
At that rate I would expect customisable musical instruments in 2026.
---
Side note. You can change the tone of speakers that play sounds. So maybe with that
---
I’m on PS4! :)
---
I’m always the scrub outside of power armor. 
---
You can buy the plans from vendors closer to the ash heap. I know Camden park sells it. Grafton station may have it as well
---
See thats different. If you accidentally shot him, and he decided to engage you in PvP, so you thought "hmm, why not". Killed him. That's just PVP
---
Ok thanks
---
Whoops sorry lol
---
They are right now with nuclear winter so I guess time will tell.
---
less and less people actually participating and helping because of the low drop rate for rare masks. why help when you can just join and people will do it for you and you still have the same chance at a mask? i just started experiencing failed parades today
---
This is already EXTREMELY easy for Beth to do because they already exist in the game. Go to the hunting Lodge near Grafton and you'll find one of every kind of animal with some new animal trophies as well.
---
My understanding is that all the alcohols still have the chance to cause addiction, including the new ones they just added. The effects of addiction is the same regardless of the drink. I ended up just buying the professional drinker perk so that I don’t have to deal with the debuffs while trying to complete some of the new challenges.
---
this video shows you how to spawn it also if another player or a camp is in the area he wont spawn https://youtu.be/_BGIZu7yETA
---
I want this so bad I would drop cash on it in a heartbeat. But I agree should not come back to atomic shop keep it as a rare paint. Keep it unique for players who have it. 
---
I’ve got your Marsupial if you can join my server and fast travel to me. :) 
---
That is the mask from the monster mash.
---
I feel retarded. Imma delete this
---
Which mask are you talking about? The monster mash mask or the giant? 
---
You look cool though, so you have that going for you!
---
I actually like this idea you could do a sweet 4th of July event for pyrotechnic explosive weapon skin mods, hot dog recipes, uncle sam hats, etc.
---
Is it right when you login? Sometimes when I first login, my weight will be much higher than usual and takes a minute to return to normal. Likewise, I've had a few instances where I would find a piece of armor with certain stats, decide to keep it as it's better than my current piece, go to check it out again once I'm back at my base and the numbers are different. This bug has happened about 3 times to me so far. It could just be a big not displaying the damage correctly.
---
The monster mash, I...
---
You got that from the parade?? 
---
Ok. I wasn't quite thinking about the copyright issue. Still, in FO4 there was a mod for a PipBoy radio that you could have your own playlist of songs. I least I could blast Super Mutants to Metallica.
---
No, I was being stupid. I thought it was an event mask. 
---
The main reason I quit playing... I'm lvl 150 with full rifle build and a two shot explosive handmade rifle. The last time I logged on my dmg was just over 120. I logged out and haven't been on since. 
---
Aw darn :( sadly, I'm on PC. As the others have said, the Vendor bot responder can get you the longshoreman outfit relatively easily. Sorry I couldn't help, but happy farming!
---
No way! Im gonna log in everyday and go for the number 1 guy prison rules, find the biggest baddest guy and take him down lol
---
Its a great group. Everyone helps, nobody (usually) steals loot if you go down. People stimpack non team members the second they fall. Quick kills.
---
Just fighting the servers.   So when the game decides we both are on I will join you.
---
This man needs a job at besthesda!
---
I love the Jukebox but I find myself turning it off the second I fast travel to my house, it only has two songs and one sounds like someone letting out really long farts lol
---
Its pretty easy to make 1400 a day from just vendor caps
---
I mainly do it for the 400+ steel I get.. I've only gotten the jumpsuits once out of 30 something runs
---
This! I have been using only one perk of starched genes for ages and losing the mutation eventually.. only recently found out you need both levels to really make it worth it 
---
Is it showing me off line? I’ll join you. 
---
Dont tell anyone here this. Its your fault somehow. 
---
Lol your right. I’m just excited for fallout 76’s future and for this wretched  winter to end.
---
I thought it was a new instrument my character could play. I was sad when it was not.
---
thanks, no wonder I kept failing.
---
Thank you for the Rez by the way XD
---
What even are the rare masks?
---
thanks, something new to me
---
Got mine from the ranger station. It was on a shelf in the building behind the station.
---
Can confirm, only like 1 in 10 cap staches I find let me search them these days 
---
Sounds like a perfect thing to put at Big Fred’s BBQ Shack
---
A good lv. 35/40 legendary is still generally better than a lv. 50 non-legendary, so it's still worth doing imo. But yeah, wish there were higher level events that are as lucrative.
---
Right lol, but I'm serious never really had any issues and I just wanna play rn , damn just happened again as soon as I load in says server not responded and boots me
---
Traveling to those places alone easily consumes half of that though. Buy a reciepe from them? No caps for traveling left at all.
---
I don't even bother. I like the surprise of completing some of the easier ones through playing naturally. I've never liked complicated achievements. 
---
Can I trade for a Fasnacht Sausage plan?
---
Thank you, that was my point. 
---
What? Lol.. fast traveling from the opposite side of the map is maybe 20 caps, at most the vendor route to 1400 caps should only take less than 100 by fast traveling 
---
so you mean we are going to fight ghosts?
---
me:oh boy 
---
reddit:posted 4 hours ago 
---
me:am i some sort of joke to you
---
I've been PvE-ing since launch, something new may refresh the experience. Hope I won't rage quit after repeatedly killed in survival mode.
---
there's a decorated door plan?
---
And my axe!
---
"My...public....workshops."
---
Sounds like someone has control issues. 
---
This. It debuffs charisma and agility until you drink again. Booze is easier to come by than adictol by the way.
---
Thanks that’s very kind, I just got really excited for the radio and instruments and felt a little let down when the radio had no speaker (would’ve loved a robotic host even).
---
My initial hopes where for a personal radio station we could name and broadcast on, I was hoping to be able to pick our playlists through holotapes found in the game, and maybe even record personal messages (maybe not our selves but perhaps a robotic narrator on something we type as personally recorded messages could be a problem).
---
But to sum it up I saddled up on the hype train and got burnt out by the end of December, but I started playing again a little ways through February and I’m pretty thrilled by the roadmap and trailer so my hopes are once again high.
---
I’m off for today but will be on tomorrow, still have a bunch 
---
Yeah I know it's fairly easy to build up caps that way, the perk card doesn't really reduce it by much though. I think it's only about 20 or 30% cheaper overall. 
---
Chems irl?
---
They did increase the budget along with reducing the size of turrets and a couple other things, while adding a limit to the amount of turrets you can have in your camp. So I wouldn't say "drastically" but yes they did do both. 
---
The Scorchbeast in that event at Morgantown doesn't attack unless first attacked. That being said, anywhere else and they will take a bite of you. 
---
The one that had me like, “Really...?” was “Take a Selfie while Naked and Intoxicated”. Yup. Fairly certain I still have a screen cap on my PC.
---
Same I still like it though, feel like it wasn’t worth the atoms though.
---
I concur
---
Okay I switched servers and they are still low. In my pip boy if it’s unequipped and I’m hovering over it it shows the true damage. When I select it, it lowers it by like 30. I don’t understand 
---
builds do not make nasty players, nasty players are just nasty, whatever their build
---
Not a server crash, but a client-side crash. Overloads the CPU, packets stop sending and receiving, and a disconnect happens due to lack of stable connection.
---
It’s been completely random over 30 times...
---
You aren't able to share with others unless you get the gear when they are in your group so even if someone does they can't share
---
How many micrograms you take?
---
I think it's around 375 and the hunters longcoat was 752ish..
---
I wish that there was a cool animation when he drinks. like his brain juice changes color or something. 
---
I would too, I put a ton of work to make my guy look remarkably similar to famous movie Russian Peter Stormare and named him as such, only to find out that all anyone sees is my dumb username.
---
Unfortunately no you can turn in 100 TD only count as 1 hopefully they'll change it soon....
---
Request accepted. I'll be on after 5:30 EST tomorrow. Hope to see you around.
---
20? It takes like 30-40 caps traveling from a southern responder trader to whitespring alone. Another 30 from whitespring to the nearest raider trader. Want to jump from there? Good luck staying below 50. And that's if you actually get the timing right...you jumped to a trader that didn't reset yet? Caps down the drain. Farming for stuff to sell? Let's say 20-50 for each jump to a farming spot?
---
Hell, even setting your base consumes 5x the price it should sometimes... the economy in this game is a goddamn lie.
---
I'm tired of making mentats 24/7.  Ingredients don't grow on trees and I end up spending 40+ caps each time. it's not worth 10 or 20 atoms.
---
"took care of all that" 😮🗡️
---
Cant sell to the vendors.
---
Lmao what, no fast travel is ever more than 20 with the perk, and farming is easy, get a plan for something that sells for a lot and make it and sell it. You clearly just dont have a good route, it never takes me more than 80-90 caps to do all 7 vendors
---
My GT is Lady Rot Roh, and I have a similar play style to you- like to explore and read the lore, although I have explored almost all of the map at this point. I’d be happy to have another friend in the wasteland though, and happy to share my knowledge of the game :)
---
Someones gonna get lucky. Im fixing to "clean house" and everything is going to be dumped in front of Vault 76.
---
So those on PS4 check Vault 76.
---
I haven’t played in about a month- I thought they fixed the duper glitch 
---
Ah okay that sucks lol
---
Thanks
---
I've been wanting someone to do this while I'm on. I was wondering if it would be more fun.. 
---
Man I love that green goo
---
I mean the update itself is OK, but not really. still boring af
---
I love Oxhorn, his lore videos are better than TV if you’re really into the world of fallout!
---
Lol ok bud. I'm not doubting your skills. You're just being an insufferable boob
---
I still feel like a game that only has humans as the interactive force tends to cheat the developers from the view they see with their games. They envisioned 76 with their view that everyone would kind of role play their characters to make the world feel full but instead a lot of the players are pulling the ol’ mmo grind for loot that makes all these events feel pointless.
---
I do love this fasnacht event but a lot of the players are just trying to hammer out the most efficient grind or not even participate which kills the game.
---
Holding out until pvp let's you create from fresh and if they dont I guess it goes to the trash can.
---
You can unlock armor mods by scrappong...yes...but some have to be found as plans
---
Wonderfully said!!  
---
I''ve had this issue a few times lately. Kust hunker down and wait. It works itself out. 
---
If you're asking if you can just craft items and them scrap them and learn mods from them. I believe the answer is yes. Haven't played in a while but unless they changed something I think you're good. That's how I got my mods for my handmade and lever action rifles. I crafted them and then scrapped them.
---
Lol I will record it
---
The enemies are all high level and it changes some of the tasks you have to complete to get the marchers set up. I think it's worth experiencing at least once.
---
Glad you understood what I meant lol. And yes please do, I'm actually really interested o.o
---
Not to mention that plenty of people play all over the world in different time zones, its not the middle of a work day for everyone lol
---
still a better love story than twilight
---
&gt; I've dropped 100% of the star items I get from the sloth as they are not high levels - so even if someone misses the tag, there is usually quite a few bags.
---
I do this too.  Dropped a 1* legendary in front of a level 30, who probably really could have used it...but this level 125 swoops in and snatches it away.  Really dude???
---
I’d love that radium rifle! How much? (GT: Lady Rot Roh)
---
I only agree with #3, but i am more in favor if the cos being there. It would be nice to move around the world freely, but given it is multiplayer, it shouldnt be free.
---
I was excited when I first saw it so I could put it on top of my base and blast it like a giant horn of Gondor. I was disappointed by the mannequin and I can live with that but when I first heard how quiet it is...yeah I wasted atoms. 
---
This is Confirmation:
---
Right after i saw the "Hunter’s Long Coat" i want to have it, so i server hoped to "Charleston Station" few times, but however  i didn't encounter the vendor until i saw this post today i followed " [u/AppalachianSlothman](https://www.reddit.com/user/AppalachianSlothman) Guide " **Lady Janet’s Soft Serve** " and after 3 server changes i managed to encounter the vendor and get my "Hunter's Long Coat". Thanks you " [u/AppalachianSlothman](https://www.reddit.com/user/AppalachianSlothman)" for sharing this information.

I would definitely enjoy that 
---
Honestly have no idea, I don’t use energy weapons much. 2k?
---
Billings Homestead, with green thumb you can easily get more than 100 razorgrain per server at a time. 
---
well thats why they took explosive energy guns out of the loot pool.
---
Hahahahahahaha. His story was actually really sad. He was in the military and while he was deployed, his old lady ran around on him. When he got back, he packed his shit and filed for divorce, but his son blames him for everything. What a fucked up world, amirite? 
---
It gets old when you get the same rewards every time, and some jackass with a tse kills everything before anyone else gets a shot in. the first day was cool though.
---
Well I know you can do that for weapons like your handmade and lever action I just wasnt sure about armor
---
I have the game and I will say, it belongs in the trash. Tom Howard played himself, I had to delete Skyrim for this game.
---
Lewis &amp; Sons Farming Supply just northwest of the Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant has 1 melon planter and 2 corn planters you can harvest towards the achievement. 
---
so you did it one event and dropped 2 masks (one rare af)?
---
Lewis &amp; Sons Farming Supply just northwest of the Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant has 1 melon planter and 2 corn planters you can harvest. 
---
Should've clarified. Old Man Winter effigy plan. Not a mask. I didn't expect to get anything since a bot was lost. 
---
Lewis &amp; Sons Farming Supply just northwest of the Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant has 1 melon planter and 2 corn planters you can harvest towards the achievement.  If you need the melon blossom, there are several at the General's Steakhouse in the middle of the Mire.
---
Fair enough. You could always just tag the items you want preserved out of your total inventory then. I agree that some sort of limit is probably a good idea. 
---
probably where people spawn in, it sometimes "drops" an item from thier inventory. it doesnt acrtually drop though, but just a visual bug.
---
Hmm, yeah I guess you're right. I'm not 100% sure and wouldn't want you to waste a bunch of materials and it not work.. :l
---
I found it funny that people thought that some music might not be appropriate for their children to hear playing this game, But the monsters, drugs, violent weapons, and alcohol are ok? Give me a break.
---
You are not able to hurt the robots yourself.  Try targeting them in VATS next run and shooting them.  It won't do any damage.
---
Yeah this is one of my main points for the post if I'm honest, there's a whole lot of map but generally a lot of it doesn't get used because of the cost to get where they want to be. 
---
I've seen plenty of cool places to set up camp but it just isn't worth the cost. 
---
Well, there does seem to be a difference in XP reward between turning in 1 and 2 data...
---
But I havent noticed a difference in rewards other than that.
---
Hey I added polished mod and now the chest is 130 base resistance
---
I think I remember seeing that the power conduits radiate power in a 2x2 foundation area. So anything within that area will be powered as long as it doesn't need to be wired directly. 
---
Wish I could upvote this 1000000x times 
---
All good! Thank you for offering it regardless! :)
---
Perfect, i’ll give it a watch! Thank you :)
---
YES!  When I bought the American flag plan, I thought that's what it was.  I still stuck the tattered thing on the side of my house, but it would be so much better if it was not only clean (like in the enclave bunker) but on a pole (also in the enclave bunker).
---
Are you being forced to read them? 
---
No, that is just the brain dead rebellion brainwashing from right wing con men.
---
Reality check, a hunting rifle and shotgun are all you need, from defence to utility. We just want to take away the mass killers. And the statistics support this.
---
And if you really think the American gov. is going to betray and murder you...then you need to stop watching so many movies.
---
Liberals are not a religeon, because we know there is a limit to how far one can go, and that we can be wrong. There is a reasonable limit to guns to, and the wrong people ahould not have them (and if you ask “whats the point of laws they will brake”, it is so that you can arrest them BEFORE they start shooting).
---
I’m in XB1x and I get this with my character! Maybe not as bad but I can definitely relate! 
---
Didnt say i quit just stoped for a bit. And I’m directly referencing the topic of the thread. If a dev sees 1000 comments like mine then they might want to actually idn fix it. 
---
U love the game, i do too. But cmon man u cant say adding this issue is minor or no big deal. Its a huge part of the game and its effecting everyone. 
---
Nice owl mask LOL
---
You found it at enclave? Have up looking for it
---
Yeah...at least I think. White painted door with an ancient colorful leaf and flower run from top left over the top to the top right.
---
I think it’s from the event.
---
I love Fallout 4, but 76 will slowly overtake it in time. 
---
You found it at enclave? Have up looking for it.
---
Anti Armor.
---
What?
---
I've been thinking about joining this group, but before I make a decision I would like more information. 
---
Because a million of those pounds would consist of unique weapons and armor. These accounts still exist. Many of them were suspended and then re-suspended due to server instability. 
---
Hoarders are no comparison to the duper’s and hoarders with the current limits can’t carry enough to come close to impacting server stability, that’s why Bethesda put those max limits.
---
one of the diseases lowers ballistic dmage i forget which. do you have any diseases? also mutations?
---
I read something a few weeks back about how some people's names changed to that in game without any explanation. Could be a bug of some kind. But the idea about them being obfuscated to make it hard to report them is pretty feasible.
---
O.O reminds me of the owl mask from the parade
---
you don’t need to let it bite you, just kill it and it has a good chance of dropping, there’s a perk under perception that gives you a chance to get more tick blood when you “search” it 
---
You can really pump up your excavator carry weight if you modify the legs with calibrated shocks, the plan is godawful expensive, so try to find mods. Each shock adds 50 carry weight, and the bug works with these too. My login carry weight when already in excavator armor is 560. Pain in the ass when I have to get out of it or die, boom goes the carry weight bonus 👅👅
---
Oh hahaha xD 
---
Equip the hunters bounty card, “search” before looting 
---
I meant the one at the event in Morgantown which was referred to in the post. Everywhere else, unless they have a yellow tag, they will nail you. 
---
It’s a slow, sometimes painful process. But it’s working!
---
Billings farm is even better. With Green Thumb I can get like 200 odd per run, there's heaps. And Silva farm just north of it has a ton of corn. Really easy run.
---
The tick can drop tick blood even if it doesnt drink the blood. Its random chance. It doesnt always drop tick blood. From what ive seen i get tick blood from 1 out of every 3 ticks. The Butcher's Bounty perk can help with the chances.
---
I'm running 144hz no problem... 
---
Then again, I haven't played the game for a while and can't confirm if this is still the same case.
---
__Nice owl mask LOL__
---
I assume you want tick blood for stimpacks and if that’s the case get the Pharma Karma Perk Maxed and go through somewhere like Fort Defiance and search all mirrors, chem boxes, and first aid kit. If you don’t want tick blood for stimpacks then go to the Moon Shiners shack near Vault 76 and kill the ticks there before they bite/suck? you. They have a chance to drop blood, but not always.
---
Butchers Bounty?
---
XD this guy
---
Thanks again for tonight bro ✌🏼👌🏼
---
yeah that, you have to manually search it though, took me a bit to figure out, happy hunting ! 
---
Decided to drop everything in the Church in Flatwoods. Im fixing to "Clean House" and someones going to get very lucky. Ammo, unused weapons i collect along the way, aid items, etc.
---
There's a chance that he will spawn if you run over the red bridges to the left and right of the station. Others mobs can spawn though a well. I run the short one to the right, if your standing 8n front of of the station looking out, toward the station. The long one to the left, if you run that one, there is also a chance he can spawn at the far end. There is also a Responder Bot that spawns, he is not the vendor.
---
My favourite is the pied piper eye bot with rat pumps &lt;3
---
Please come back mothman paint...
---
Sure. I just always see it there, and you should not spend caps you do not have to. 
---
&gt;The character lock suggestions I see is too early as well I think. People just might not want to start over to play the pvp mode. This way the pvp servers are populated enough.  
---
People just might not want to play with players 300 levels above them either.  
---
Solved! Thanks kind sir or madam

Yeah, that cabin makes for some good photo ops

Me and my team have launched so much the past week we have started timing each other’s runs through the silo 😂 the current time to beat is 11 minutes 52 seconds 😂 we can team up again tomorrow if you want bro, just drop me a message when you’re online and ready to nuke! 
---
Sure thing shoot me a DM and I’ll answer any questions or concerns you have 👍
---
I have these available for sell. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0SV3FPiwNeaaNY8mK4yL_AFjB75kar4ZzBPjg1lGBc/edit?usp=drivesdk

Totally, though the camera with ultra wide is kind of useful for this already.
---
2* Two shot submachine gun 25% faster fire rate. Level 45
---
2* executioner submachine gun 33% vats hit chance. Have to check the level but should be 45 as well.
---
I also have a bloody sub as well but I've been using it and not sure what the stats are exactly.  
---
I can't help but I love that title
---
You make good points and I agree. I think that if people communicate in conversations like this and offer contrast ideas as well as ideas on how to help polish it, we will end up having a better supported game for all types of players, rather than either the more hardcore players or the more casual players being rewarded. I’m retired, so I know that I play a lot. I also like challenges. What I don’t want is this game to turn into something like world of Warcraft where the game favored more casual players and made the game insanely easy and mindless. 
---
In contrast though, I don’t think casual players or people who want an easier game to be forced to put the same hours that I do in the game for better gear. That’s kind of why I brought up easy mode vs. creating several modes that you can put your character in but lock them in that mode. No transfers or anything like that between modes. Because at least that way, people don’t just farm easy mode, get everything fast and then corrupt the economy for those who prefer to either grind it out or trade. I do like hearing people’s opinions on the subject. Some are outstanding ideas. Some are just trolls or someone who doesn’t quite grasp the concept of catering to each players time vs. just flat out ruining the game for several groups of people in the community. Survival mode is a good push in the right direction but I’d also hope for an adventure mode that can be tailored to the players ability to play and desire to either become good fast or make it more challenging.

Quote from patch 6 notes
---
"Dev Note: The ability to contest a claimed Workshop is intended and encouraged behavior as part of Workshop design. This change should prevent situations where a Workshop owner could prevent others from attempting to contest it without becoming Wanted by destroying something or picking a lock to reach the Workshop."

Workshops are pvp content

I wanted tequila he he. Or better to say Biv wanted the tequila.

Thats good shit.  ill subscribe keep it rolling

Can I have the first one?

Yeah it's like there's one or two easy ones then three or four ones that are a #huuuuge time sink.

Oh, I’m blind, my bad.

Confirming/adding when you run a wire from a generator to a conduit it supplies power through the walls, ceiling and floor for a decent sized area, user above said 2x2, sounds about right. It will power lights, tv, jukebox, etc. But not things that specifically need direct power like water purifiers and the terminal. 
---
Conduits can also be placed on the outside of your house instead of the inside and it will still power the same area. 
---
You should see my explosive flamer, it is a mini gun that break after one and a half clips. It’s atleast fun as hell till it breaks. 
---
I believe the BoS vendor at the watoga shopping center and the T60 plans 
---
It's available but I won't be back on until next weekend. Spring break and all. I'm on Xbox GT BLUBLZRedeux. If your still interested next week hit me up
---
&gt; People have now taken to running to the forest to get the sloth before he even gets near the town
---
I didn't think the sloth was out wandering around in the forest until the parade's end; I've seen him just spawn and appear multiple times.
---
Ok I’ll probably forget to but next time your on just message me
---
Will do
---
Because of some useless daily achievements nobody cares about?
---
Think of the generator as a input and the connector as a output. Things, MOST ELECTRICAL ITEMS, don’t require wiring because that would be tedious in the game. Larger electrical objects require a wire connection directly from the output source. 
---
Hell, why not. I've been on since beta, I've had numerous crashes, glitches, and general fuckery that annoyed me. And I still played it. I knew that Bethesda weren't known for bug free games. Never have been. It's BETTER than it used to be, is it fixed? Going by the daily bug reports on reddit, I'd say no. But if you're one of these 'finished it, now what?' type of gamer, then you might not enjoy it anyway. Help noobs, dump your unwanted ammo at train stations, fly on into a mob fight with a jet pack and drop a mini nuke. Or don't 
---
Slow down, take small bites. this event is one that should be back year after year, you shouldn't try and eat all of it at one time lol. What ya gonna do next year when the festival rolls around and there are no new hats or masks? 
---
Double check your inventory. The pieces may be in a chassis, and if there are no pieces the game may have reverted back to before you crafted them. So check you junk and see if your materials are there. 
---
I just about did give up. Now I'm looking for one more.
---
Yeah, that’s how I got my ultracite guess rifle plans. For me it seems to be one in six scorch beast will have a plan. 
---
I guess we will just  wait and see eh?
---
Meh. Living in Japan and here, we can't buy atoms. They didn't make the purchase of atoms available here yet. So the only way for us to get things from the atomic shop is by earning atoms from the challenges.
---
I like removing the helmet from my t51 and wearing the owl mask instead.  It just looks wicked cool.
---
Nope everythings gone the excavator and my other power armour i checked everywhere. The materials are gone as well.
---
You mean double bare you
---
Oh wow! I was wondering if there were other, better farms. Thanks for that! 
---
Folks you don't have to eat it all at one time. It should be seasonal and roll back next year. What happens next year and there are no new masks or hats added? 
---
I just tested it and no they are not pop-able. My apologies, I assumed they would be. It'd a bummer. 
---
sacks are good for making T bags. 
---
I don’t think most people will be playing the game next year
---
I’ve got a spare one too
---
He spawns out in the edge of town a lot. I’ve also seen him spawn in the middle of town too. When he spawns on the edge it’s usually while we are getting attacked by wolves so if you are busy killing them, one guy can run around to the spawn and kill him before he steps out to the rest of the group.
---
No, because of overall gameplay and events. No vaults even opened yet and seems like a lot of things still broken like the weapons, damage, ect. Almost been out for 6 months and still working on fixing the essentials. 
---
Yay
---
Good to know. Whitesprings, on the other hand ... very dangerous place to have Gun Fu equipped.
---
They advertised a cute little event with masks as rewards and 5 of them being "exceedingly rare".  "Exceedingly rare" should be a big tip off that the vast majority of people will never get or perhaps even see one.
---
Amen
---
Me too, and thank you! I'll definitely make an update and hopefully it can come in handy for others too.
---
With the perk is it
---
Similar thing happened to me. I turn around, he is there, hit the attack button, and then saw he wasn't hostile. I hope I see him again some time because I feel bad I killed him.
---
If you're PS4, hmu.  I love picking violet flux and have a bit too much stable violet in my inventory now
---
There's also General's Steakhouse for corn
---
I don't mind when things have a low drop rate.  I don't mind having to grind for stuff I want.  I even don't mind the RNG-ness of it all.  I do however mind when its all of the above AND the window is only a week.  It's especially aggravating, however, bc it's all just cosmetics.  The icing on the cake though has got to be the "legendary" boss sloth at the end that gives crap lvl 30-35 gear.  I kind of just want to leave group at that point, go full pvp and kill the players instead of the sloth just for a short lived giggle right before being slaughtered by the millions of TSE weapons that everyone (except myself) seem to have.  Way to go devs.  Make OP weapons easy to dupe...er...I mean farm but not some silly cosmetic masks... A+ BGS...lovely troll...now gimme my fasnacht skull mask dernit!!!
---
I think the key word here is "rare." Those items are rare. That means not everyone will get them. I know it's sad, but that's the way they wanted it and they made the game, so that's how it's going to be.
---
You gotta make friends with min-max players, I guess.
---
Actually, no they didn't.  They said some of the masks would be exceedingly rare.  Not just rare, mind you, but "exceedingly" rare.
---
oh great! I'll check it out. Thank you.
---
Wow!
---
Excavator plans can be found in Grafton and Camden. T-45, 51, and 60 plans can be found at the BoS vendor (Phoenix) in Watoga. X01 plans aren't really found for sale anywhere but you can find a small section of mods at the military wing of the Whitespring Bunker.
---
 I’ve seen you before!!!  You and your gun!!
---
https://youtu.be/juEc03i6vLs
---
They should have just made it so that each player gets a different set of masks, and that the community has to trade with eachother to get the ones you want, similar to the Caring is Sharing event that Dying Light had
---
I spend far too much time going out and drinking in real life to do it for 4 hours online when I get home.
---
That’s actually a really good idea, kinda wish they did that
---
Noscope_420bird
---
I was a little disappointed that the radios you can place in your camp that they added recently don’t play music
---
Did you forget we are all fallout players and they have bred hoarding and collecting into us? A special limited time event that no one can get the rare items is a huge fail on bethesda part. Let alone they sold this event as a way for folks to trade with others. 
---
And next year...it would even be more silly of bethesda not to add more new masks.
---
That looks fantastic.
---
I too went a bit bonkers with my camp.  It's a full-on [hotel](https://imgur.com/hdi2WG1) now.
---
Have you made it yet?  I have this plan but can’t find it to make.  
---
I wear my PA for the extra carry weight...however I remove the helmet and wear a mask (usually the owl) instead.  Best of both worlds.
---
I really wish it wouldn't come on as soon as someone comes to my base. Like it was cool for a little bit, but now it's just really annoying. I think I spend 90% of this game turning the Jukebox off
---
It must be my birthday.
---
Biv's the name....drinkin's the game...and I am in first place hoo boy.
---
I like him almost as much as Grahm.
---
Trying to do a workshop defend event and the last enemy of the last wave is glitched in the floor and I can’t fucking kill it ffs
---
Why not both? I invest in 9 rifleman an 9 shotgunner all the way. Rocking a handmade, a silenced hunting rifle and a quad double barrel shot gun. Pretty pretty fun! 
---
&gt; last time i checked that thread the ones that were acquired were done through the dev room
---
In all fairness, on the posts I've seen people are *speculating* that they are from the dev room with really no other evidence than "well that person has one and I don't, so they must be a cheater".
---
Some people never seem to get it and some people like me only get it and nothing else :( . It depends on who wants it.
---
The chances of getting mods by scrapping armor are much lower than for scrapping most guns, though.
---
I finally participated in the parade at level 13. I was in the town when it started and kicked off a robot. Then was getting murdered by some honey monster. Then a group of about 10 level 60 and above players rode in and finished the robots in like 2min. I even got a single shot on the sloth. Their are some great players out there who are just good citizens. They left me alone and let me do my thing. One guy actually went around and slapped all the other players trying to initiate pvp while the robots gathered. He passed by me though as I was 50 levels below him. 
---
Yeah.. that's why I was so unsure because i rarely unlock anything. I'd rather buy the mods but I never see them on venders. Who would even have leather mods?
---
How???
---
This.  Spot on, my friend.  Spot on.
---
Limited time items and stuff yet to come.
---
I’ve maxed out all of my additional rifle damage cards and swap between a .45 and 308 rifle (I think I have like 6k ammo combined.) Maybe I should get more into PVP. Are they still planning or doing more faction stuff or did I make that up?
---
Yeah, I wish there was an option to turn that part on/off, and I wish I was able to make my radios automatically play.
---
Grind combat challenges... do they become repeatable once you hit a certain cap?
---
LMFAO!! Nice edit on your comment. Really that petty of a person you need to add stuff in your comments after the fact. Wow  i really have no respect for you, what a fucking loser move 
---
We annoyingly (to a few) call the runs out on here or on xbox live Looking for Groups. We give 15-20 min warning so people can join and prep. 
---
There's a bug (I assume it's a bug) where the berry mentats and Targeting HUD effects apply to everyone around.
---
If you see someone just glowing red, that means someone was nearby with a Targeting HUD (assuming you don't have it on your power armor)
---
if you see someone that looks like a pink mist is surrounding them, that's berry mentats.
---
I got a giant mask and a Fasnacht sausage recipe
---
plataform ? 
---
Same here
---
I have reinstaled the game on another disk, didn't fix it, can't use tinkers workbench and aim in first person
---
Do you use/used any mods?
---
PC : 960, I7 
---
Ingame tag : CriticalClafouty
---
Seconded. I do a few if they are easy (the craft 50 drinks one is easy enough if you know where to go), and ignore the rest. What gets me is the "Complete 4 smaller objectives" ones, because they themselves are full pre-WA challenges crammed together, and there are always at least half that are not easily achieved solo or without certain gear.
---
My camp is a big red box 
---
The normal part of me hopes you left him something great.  The raider side of me hopes you left landmines. 
---
I love this but it would have to have some sort of opt-out because new players/new characters would be limited to about 1/3 - 1/2 of the forest if the whole dang map was nuked.
---
Agree with Xanedil. Also you only lose like 10 base dmg from a gun being 35 or 40. Some of my best gear is level 35.
---
All my SBQ fights were just random.
---
Nuke notification? I check the map, if it's for the SBQ and i have nothing better to do i might join.
---
Never failed any SBQ event, heck, earlier today someone decided to drop a nuke during the masks event. Obviously nobody joined the guy, i was slowly losing my mind in Helvetia so i decided to just join the dude. 2 people; we did ~25% of the damage(first hp bar) by the time someone else joined. By the end we were 6-7 random people, and only me and one other guy had any ranged weapons to shoot the queen while she was flying. Pain in the butt but the the melee guys did a great job when she landed. 
---
With the SBQ it's not about getting enough people, it's about getting some people that can do the job. If you have a group of 10 people unable to deal consistent damage to the queen you'll fail. Especially since the sbq gets buffed for a 10 people fight.
---
On the other hand if you have 3 people with high end gear they'll easily kill it.
---
It's more about a balance between the number of people and the potential damage output. 
---
You can definitely kill it with 5 players, and you can definitely kill it with 5 random players. I never joined any teams or stuff like that. Just join and shoot it until its dead. 
---
Anyway, the main idea is that you need people that can deal constant damage, not a lot of people. SBQ event is a case of quality &gt; quantity. 
---
Slightly unusual facial feature blocking headware for the purposes of concealing identity in an amusing and festive fasion.
---
PC, sorry for not say it, I will edit my post.
---
Nice, how do you show the power armor on the power armor station when not moding it?
---
I’ve been trying to get back into the game with the new updates, is there a certain place I can find a lot of camp plans?
---
More hair styles and give the ability to give yourself colored highlights. 
---
Oh, I see what you mean now.  I totally misunderstood your original comments.  
---
They are considered a single item as long as they are stacked. That's 1000 hours wasted right there
---
I used to login and play for a while to do daily's, some were so easy and fun. Now I log in, look at how dumb the missions are and go play something else.
---
If you're on PC I'll do it for free 
---
If you don’t get anyone before 2 AM EST I will do it. I have the perks to make the condition better and also at 200% condition. I might need some black titanium from you, not sure I have enough. I probably have enough of everything else. I’d do it for 1000 caps? GT JDBuckSavage
---
Platform?  I’d be happy to help on ps4. Could add some calibrated shocks too if you kick in materials for that upgrade
---
They seem to get harder during the weekends?
---
It was a good time to be had during all four events I did tonight.  Everyone got a piece of the sloth, some goofy masks and camp plans.

Bummer- it’s always on a different platform. But best of luck with the PA :)
---
I feel it will eventually become my preferred game by the end of spring. Spring is bringing in all the stuff I really need to enjoy the game as much as 4. camp decoration with items (been saving cool stuff just for it), legendary vendor, possible replay value from the ~~Dungeon~~ Vault Crawls. For me, it's not there yet, but it might be by the time the current roadmap is done.
---
They also said I would get a canvas bag with my collector's edition. Forgive me if I don't believe a goddamned word that comes out of their mouth. The masks aren't dropping. They're broken. 
---
Thank you!
---
What improvements? Like five crafting recipes and a level 15 limited run event?
---
Im on xbox but thank you for your time :)
---
you'd have to actually be able to do daily quests for me to sign off on this one.

Might be a glitch someone else reported where player's names turned into their IP6 addresssess... which is bad :P

Same I literally got stuck in an elavator in fo4, forever.  
---
I’m going full on Raider Warlord in Survival Mode. Wildly throwing explosives, living in whatever suits of power armor I can find, and the biggest, baddest weapons I can get.
---
Definitely gonna make a separate character for it if I can.
---
The bots there vary. Sometimes liberators, sometimes American.
---
I want some bagpipes. 
---
So I can play them in a dungeon level and make everything swarm at me. 
---
your monitor is 144hz, and when you run it you get over 60fps? People have reported this issue in the past.... Are you sure your monitor is actually set to 144 and not 60?
---
I've been experiencing *\*less\** BS today. More high levels taking a chill pill and letting lowbies hit the sloth. More efficient collecting/startup phase. Actual chatter. Friendly trade of more common masks for those who don't have them. Some fellow even game my lowbie 1k 10mm ammo when I ran out.
---
Your mileage may vary, of course. Kinda curious what platform you're on too, been wondering about how this sort of thing is received with different social group preconceptions.
---
Lol are you joking? 
---
The mannequins are evil creepy agents of some cult magic gone wrong and have no place in my camp :P
---
That's my experience, yes. Whether people are in your group is irrelevant. You can stay hidden but you won't get the sneak bonuses.

I'm not 100% sure about the details, but the principle seems to work. When scorchbeasts are in the air you'll occasionally get a sneak bonus even when there are other players around, which is probably because you're briefly considered to be the closest target.
---
Oh yeah. They god RIDICULOUS after the DLC dropped.
---
Sorry Bethesda. I'm not buying your fucking microtransaction money.
---
I really enjoy him, but sadly I can barely hear him. for whatever reason his volume is so low for me :(
---
Ok so I’m out of the loop. Which ones are rare or ultra rare? My favorite so far is the owl mask you have on but I only have three masks. 
---
Damn thats a fast run! I gotta go farm those circuits before I drop again. All my cores are busted. I'll drop with you again tomorrow tho!
---
Am on PC, if you are, let me know and I'll post if I have a space come end of event (keeping one for my mutton chop wearing scotsman, because of fukken course I am)
---
Lol always, I'll get u on the next one
---
R/market76 might be able to solve that.  If your on xbox ive got a few of each
---
Rare mask 
---
At least not directly in the middle of the forehead. Neck yes, cheek even but forehead looks ridiculous
---
Good teamwork. Its nice splitting the load with launches. The downtime in between is nice.
---
Pve bloodied builds I've met have been 100% nice however anyone that makes a bloodied build for Pvp is going to mostly be a dick. The reason being that bloodied builds are most powerful with melee (use unyielding to get +15 strength) and they won't want to let you get far away from them otherwise you can just one shot them with any ranged gun so this results in them chasing you around the map until they murder you or you instigate Combat and they one tap you. If they let you get away then they run the risk of you turning on them.
---
I dont think the mothman paint was limited time
---
Aren't most of the re-banned users hoarders? If they ain't causing instability, why did bethesda ban them again? One of my re-banned friend was carrying around like 800 pounds. Bethesda decided even that is enough to cause instability. Whatever you may think, bethesda would think otherwise
---
Nice!
---
It's common. Anyone who cares enough to pay caps probably has it already. If the Fasnacht event is limited time, I guess you could hold extras and hope to sell to people who missed it.
---
I don't know, 4's still got Dialogue/Characters and Modifications, but it sounds like 76 will have those later (hopefully this year for both.)
---
Until then, while I *vastly* prefer 76's crafting to 4's, 4's gonna stayy favorite.
---
Only have to wait until the the *"Van Lowe Taxidermy"* store becomes available... It's primed and just waiting to be switched on.
---
I settle for two half walls with Windows to make one full wall. It's not the same, but it's decent enough
---
Yeah. I remember that ugly summer mask from Fallout 3. And the Christmas power armor was in 4 if you bah ha ha, yeah, okay.
---
Seriously, though, thanks for the sarcasm. It's basically what I think when I see the "reused assets" argument. It held more water during beta, but it's obviously got a lot of new shit people ignored to complain about the Preston Garvey suit lookalike in the shop.
---
"I understand that the brewing workstation is their biggest achievement so far" lolol rekt
---
I failed three parades today because people were just wandering around not helping. The robots have been being killed really easily today as well.
---
Place it there, use the station for a moment then leave
---
Moonshiner cabin has 3-4. Butcher is a good pet to double the reward. 
---
And that's for a big damage weapon. A rapid fire gun might be as little as 2 points difference. My level 35 TSE double barrel shotgun is still my go to for murdering things, even post nerf.
---
Probably not, im level 111 and I'm still missing most camp plans
---
Swap to using Melons as your food source at your base. They give a value of 10% food and 15% water (per one melon). If you have the Herbivore mutation, it becomes 20% food and 15% water. Rarely do I ever actually drink Purified water anymore. Have a stack of 500+ on me to sell to vendors as we speak.
---
Hell yeah, I wish the item instruments were playable anywhere.
---
You put a hat on after wearing a mask. Best glitch ever!
---
same. I didn’t even realize he was supposed to be drunk. I turned subtitles on after I couldn’t hear the spring event robot. 
---
Lol
---
How much titanium do u need?
---
You can't dictate to people how they should be with the event, if they wanna get angry about the drop rate then it's up to them.
---
Personally i think theres a valid point to that argument , 0.2% or whatever it is, Is ridiculously stingy and part of the fun for some people is getting a better chance at these drops wich they then trade with their friends for the rare one they most desire.
---
Many other games have event currency for a special event Vendor so you can earn the desired item if it doesn't drop, this event is badly implemented.
---
Anyone having a crap over other people having a crap about an ingame event is worse than the people having a crap about the ingame event... 
---
Hrmmm...
---
Beret is rare, which is just like anything else, everyone will find one mask more than others. I have only found 3 soldiers and giants in my 35 times doing the event but I've found about 10 witches and an equal amountto the others whereas I've seen people with no witches and tons of giants/soldiers.
---
THIS. 
---
They do... eventually.
---
I have a vampires death tambo and sledgehammer. The don't seem worth it to me u less you're spced into melee. Look up captainoob of YouTube. Vampire works for sneaking melee or heavy guns. 
---
On a lowbie with my camp set up near the ~~Faushnaught~~ ~~Fausnahut~~ the seasonal event, high level walks (literal walk, backspace as default key) into my house and puts about while I sit on a rocking chair and wait. Just, out of nowhere. Was quite amusing to have a stranger just show up.
---
Ooh, I hadn't thought of big Fred's. There isn't any quests I've found that go there, so thatd be an easy one to add to.
---
That would be rad!
---
Awesome! Thank you, I'll check that out too.
---
The fast traveling cost is allright imi but the game is seriously missing options. They should at least add some more free tavel spots similar to vault 76 or something like vehicles, animal mounts... actuall options to walking or wasting a lot of caps to avoid walking.
---
Even the elders scrolls games have mounts and carriages. Every single mmo does in fact... why can't fo76?
---
Congrats. Buying  legit end game gun made this way more playable. Also, your gun cannot drop now. No more explosive laser or plasma. 
---
Also wayyyy more quests
---
This is a great idea, I hadn't thought of that. Would be a perfect time to do it. Though I wouldn't be surprised if they had a big fireworks thing set up for it. 
---
Except there are 5 masks it seems fair that everyone get at least one mask for their time and Bethesda said they want to encourage trading, if people don't get the rare mask they wanted then they could trade with someone else but at this point 99.97% of people doing this event won't even get the thing people want, they'll have to wait till next year and the year after that, and the year after that.
---
it's shit like this is why I just haven't wanted to play recently. I want this game to be good but holy fuck are they doing a terrible job with this.
---
Delicious, vault fattened iguanas... \**drool*\*
---
... I wonder if Vault Iguana is the same as Angus Beef? *Look at the marbling!*
---
If you gain exp from a kill so does your teammate. You know without them needing to tag them 
---
im very happy to hear you have been having a good experience. i am a xbox user btw, and i took a 10mm pistol and i land a couple bullets on the sloth just to get a reward and then i handle the wolves and stingwings. im lvl 142 so the rewards arent needed and i give them to low lvls. total i have done 69 parade runs now
---
Memorials to the dead, made by the last survivors who are now gone as well...
---
No, those atoms are worth nothing.
---
What ?
---
With the perk for less materials I am not sure I need any, but I can’t check right now. I’ve got quite a bit but not sure it’s enough. If you can farm maybe 10-20 between now and then just to be safe, hopefully that’a not too bad if you just hit some miners. You would also need a chassis because I don’t have an extra. I know you can find them lots of places, like belching Betty.
---
Thank you for your kind gesture  I'd  love to my name on there is PeachieBear 
---
Not super bugged by quests, currently, I have plenty.
---
Although the mayor for a day quest feels broken, I've tried doing the last bit like 7 times and I always die.
---
I've just stopped caring about walking further than the high school into watoga at this point.
---
I'm also more of a builder, and with the recent buff (thank god for it) I think I can build pretty much anything I want.
---
YOU DON"T NEED TO BE EVERYTHING. MAKE YOUR CHOICES AND LIVE WITH THEM
---
Yea ill get em
---
Same here. Level 35 TSE Double Barrel. With the shotgunner perk cards is still quite a crowd control weapon. 
---
Maybe landmines covered with balloons?
---
You must have drank my bad moonshine. 
---
Even with 100k caps no one wants to sell their ultra rare mask (if they have one) It's probably rarer than the TSE back there if there was no dupe exploit.
---
This was worth reading through the entire thread.  This.  Yes. 
---
🔥
---
I hope?
---
Ok. We can meet at my camp, and if you have some various junk in stash just in case, plus the BT just in case, we’ll be good.
---
Is the orange/black Beret rare? I got one last night with just 4 robots alive from the event
---
Those don’t prove that the masks dropped from the event, people have been glitching into the dev room for the last week. 
---
Hold all ammo. You might not need it now, but you might want it later for a gun you find. Keep it in your stash.
---
Do the main quests and the side quests you find while doing them. many give you useful plans. Events give you more decorative plans, especially taking/defending/retaking workshops. Doing "Power Up X" events gives you plans for better generators.
---
When you get to finding your gun you prefer, you can find the plans for them, craft them at the lowest level they can be crafted, and then scrap for mods. Easiest way to get mods for some weapons, like the Handmade.
---
All the way to the north west is Aronholt Farm (if you look at the map, ther eis a ridge in the upper left with a pic of a farm on it, that's the farm). There is almost all the growable crops there, for your ownf arming, but it is also the easiest way tog et cranberries, which can be turned into cranberry cobbler for a 5% xp boost. Between that and sleeping in a bed at camp, you can be at an easy 10% xp boost. Useful if you burn through the leveling quests in areas that are appropriate level to you and need to explore/grind a level.
---
Give me 20 min
---
Are you still online by any chance?  
---
Never bring it back, just make newer better ones.
---
Ah okay. Thanks!
---
Put a connector near them then attach a wire to it
---
Finally! Brilliant!
---
Nice any luck getting any other then the 5 common masks ?
---
you are capped to the range of your camp.  I think the drone should be in your inventory and able to be deployed throught Appalachia. Catch some amazing photos.
---
I may join the kill whatever I come across group, just in survival server
---
I don’t get off work for 2 hours, like I said earlier, which is 2 AM EST, so you have some time.
---
Good idea. I’m currently playing while glancing around in hopes I catch sight of my earbud that came with the system. Hate it when people talk to me but silly me has misplaced the thing and I can’t talk back.
---
Yeah, it works for armor too. Also you can unlock all unlockable mods just by crafting and scrapping any piece of that armor type. The standard method is to spam minimum-level light arms because those are cheapest. You want Armorer 2 to reduce the crafting cost, and preferably Super Duper and Scrapper, but those are less critical.
---
You will need to craft a \*lot\* of pieces for a good chance at the last few armor mods. Something like 100-200 for the final one, as against \~20 for the last mod for most ranged weapons.
---
Hey! Discord has a group about Settlement building [Discord Settlement](https://discord.gg/vXXuYZ)  also YouTube has some great videos with tips...but you will have to play around with power connectors and generators. Hope that helps!
---
and have you seen this event before?  
---
it's the same every time I meet him with the same message 
---
I mean at some point I have to wonder then, what's the point? They spend dozens of man hours and half of the quest rewards will never be seen by more than a handful of players? 
---
I just have to wonder knowing Bethesda if they didn't make a decimal error and they're way more rare than they intended them on being. Either that, or they purposely made half of the rewards basically ungettable to get more attention on the masks in the atomic shop or plan on using the same quest next year and don't plan on making new masks for the next year.
---
If it was a 0.1% chance, you'd think by now more than a few people would have pictures of some of them. The fact that we've all seen the same 2 pictures for both masks just seems incredible to me.
---
I guess you're fine with lottery-esk odds of getting an in-game cosmetic. I'm not. It's a video game lol. I believe that something in a game I've paid full price for shouldn't be hidden behind a wall of rng that 99% of the players won't even see, let along aquire. But that's my opinion.
---
We don’t know what the exact rules for the pvp will be in survival. They want to encourage it more, and the rules right now are set to discourage aggressive pvp. 
---
It’s actually in dome 7
---
Ah okay thats cool. If i do fall asleep i hope we can reschedule.
---
PC here. And props to you for handing out the low level legendary items, nobody has yet to do that from what I have seen. Although I've been seeing what looks like obvious friend groups a lot, so who knows.
---
It's not that it's sad (i won't even wear the masks anyways) it's the idea that half of the quest rewards haven't been seen by 99 percent of the players. I just think something is off with their math and they made a mistake. That, or we're going to mysteriously see the masks appear in the cash shop in a few months.
---
If so I would be available Saturday afternoon.
---
Well considering all heavy weapons received a buff yes, the .50 Cal is very much still in the meta
---
&gt;I've only ventured in there a coupe times,might have to take another look,not sure where to start.
---
When you fast travel there head in the doors, down the stairs, and take a right. There's a whole hallway filled with like 10 different shops selling all kinds of crap. People usually sell unwanted legendary things to the artisan corner, so definitely check there after a nuke. 
---
I think i have a 2 shot tommy gun. Wont be back on til tomorrow tho. Maybe level 45? Same gt as name here
---
It's all RNG
---
Ah alright. Maybe no secret Chinese conspiracy but I think this place still holds something for the future. There are a few areas like this that feel like they are just waiting for future content.
---
Ever heard of the "big" mask?
---
Date can't be changed. Your just in a memory lounger, running the vault 76 simulation program. ;)
---
I've probably killed 200+ scorchbeasts and found an Ultracite Explosive Vents on one once. I did wonder if someone was just trolling me by putting it on the corpse, but it might be possible. They do drop prime plans occasionally, maybe one per 10 or 20.
---
anyone lvl 50 and below i help as much as possible, drop stims, purified water, ammo. im melee so i dont use it and this event has been good to help get low people a good start with legendarys. and im solo as only a couple friends play and its spoty if they do
---
Smoking should be like bubblegum but instead of having a positive hp ,  a small health decrease.
---
Develop addiction as well 
---
I have an abundance. 2 caps/piece fair?
---
Noted,  thank you so much for the confirmation and advice jaj22
---
When it comes to legendaries, any mob can drop any weapon or armor
---
we just need jukebox tapes collectables for our camp
---
Hmm... pretty specific example there, eh? Lol
---
Sell it for players.  Heavy gunners can use all the .308 they can get anyone with nice .38 can use lots of it, because its weak ammo.
---
I’m starting to believe that even though this is true that some mobs have a better chance or dropping a specific armor/weapon. 
---
Plenty of players buy stimpacks.
---
This. Exactly this.
---
Unfortunately, whitespring is the easiest but west tek is good as well
---
"Daily Challenge".       
---
It's supposed to be challenging. Sometimes challenges cannot be completed. 
---
I've run into him once or twice. I think he's just there to add some flavor to the game like the prize bot.
---
Might be nice but not really concerned about this one
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
"recent/upcoming" I think qualifies in this context
---
How are automatic rifles? 
---
I have some very bad news.
---
They don't care.
---
Not in some stupid "giant souless corperation" way. But rather in a "we've chosen our path, for our own reasons" way. They're using 76 to experiment in the standards of survival gameplay. Most games now days would require a new character, which I suspect is fully half the reason they're not doing that for this game. Never mind their disinclination for hardcore survival PVP gameplay in the first place. I'm shocked they bothered, to be honest.
---
I ran into him near R&amp;G station. His insult to me: 
---
"Hey human, you have no friends because all of your friends and loved ones died in a fiery nuclear explosion 35 years ago... hAhahA... Contacting local burn unit... peace out loser" 
---
I honestly stopped for a moment and died inside thinking about how everyone I would have known is dead. 
---
Then I laughed really, REALLY hard, because laughing is easier than crying. 
---
Dddaaaannnnggggg. Do you know where I can find those?
---
If you team up with someone they can build at your camp. If you ask nice over at fo76/filthycasuals, I bet someone would be willing to help if you supplied materials. 
---
I would hope everyone knew this already. But a PSA is a PSA.
---
Your forgetting the pipe character Il|llI|lII|lI
---
Modify your characters appearance and that should fix it. 
---
I am a solo too, I just don't enjoy the game up to the nuke silo part with friends running every which way dragging me away from neat terminals and notes because lulz pew pew. 
---
I had one but sold it to vendor. Now i wish I saved it
---
I had a lvl 35 3* mutant’s minigun w/ 25% faster fire rate drop from this event.I added the accelerated barrel and it absolutely wrecks. Im level 220 and its my favorite non-prime heavy weapon I carry.
---
I only voted no because I already have 5 characters.  I may delete one who knows.
---
I think it’s a big and that’s the internal uuid for the character and for whatever reason it shows that instead of the “friendly name” that it should 
---
**This.**
---
I have always played Fallout (at least since 3), as a hoarder. In 4, I got worse because the game encouraged it with the crafting system. 
---
When I walked out of 76, i went looking for my first settlement (Wade Airport was the first I randomly stumbled upon in the B.E.T.A.), then found the resource generators &amp; went to work. 
---
Keep in mind, in the B.E.T.A., they produced a lot more and it was often the straight scrap (no acid needed!), so hoarding was easy. Once I got to Whitespring, and I found Bubbles, I cleared her out constantly. Couple that with the “no max weight”, another Fallout 4 deal I was used to &amp; it stacks up quick. Before they changed the resource miners to ore, I had *thousands* of pounds of scrap &amp; Nukas. 
---
Flashforward to after duping became a thing, and Nukas were still in hot demand, and I have a fully decked out character &amp; have traded for a crap load of flux and the all the serum plans; was setting up for a vendor. Many of my friend just donated shit. 
---
Then I was banned. I wasn’t certain of the providence of some my donates/trades, and I had drop traded so much between mules that, after hear Glorf12’s story, I knew I was screwed.
---
Got the email about my ban being a “suspension”, and my hope raised, minutely. We then, after about a month (far shorter than expected), and I got my main back. I immediately went about shedding my weight as fast as I could (before the reban happened, I had got all but one character under weight; with proof), and when the reban hit.
---
Bethesda, I was trying to make it right, albeit keeping some of my hard earned loot. Why hast thou forsaken me?  Why am I a cheater for playing the game the way *you* * **taught** * me to play? Why, if I am not permanently banned, must I be in this purgatory? Can I not know my terms &amp; time?
---
I understand a bunch of shit went wrong, but not telling us what is going on, specifically in this matter, is not helping. 
---
I **love** Fallout. I have played since 1. When 4 came out, I bought it originally on Xbox, but then bought Gold on PC. My wallet is the Pip-Boy “thumbs up” emblem. I have defended this game; even after the ban; to my maximum abilities.  It **is** my favorite series of games, and I *hoped* this would be a new chapter.
---
Now I am starting to thing I am done, and, quite frankly, it makes me sad. 
---
I seriously doubt the ability of the dev team to fix the duplication problems.  They can make band-aids for those sucking chest wounds they call code. But actually fix the problem? Highly unlikely.
---
Civil war body has been my farm thing lately, seen it exactly once after hundreds of attempts. Yeesh.
---
I remember hearing something about factions but I don’t think it’s going to be on survival on the 26th. Pvp can be very fun. You’ll hear a lot of complaining about unbalanced builds but what it dumbs down to is that those people refuse to learn from mistakes nor will they try and understand the opposing players perks or armor. For a long time people thought and still think sentinel armor is unbreakable and considered god mode. So they complain about the rare armor. All you have to do is stagger them to break the effect. You’ll probably start pvp kind of frustrated because how the mechanics work but if you break down the mechanics, this is probably the most balanced pvp game that I’ve seen that is strategy based. Go burn off some ammo. Just make sure you store your junk first and make sure you only participate as long as you are willing to lose caps. 
---
What I did was make multiple mules. Two out of three are almost at max caps. So losing them doesn’t really bug me. A suggestion that you can attempt is making mules. Transfer excess junk and aid to them when the stash is getting full. Level them to about level 15. Get 5-6 in charisma. Have a friend take you to the vendors so you can get the locations. Then sell stuff from the mule but keep some stuff on him just Incase you run out of something. It opens the possibility to 1200 more caps a day. With alcohol being out now, you can also do that daily and have more chances at recipes to help you out. My character is a full blown alcoholic. I have a god awful amount of nuka dark, whiskey and vintage nukashine lol. He’ll never go thirsty. 
---
I’d also suggest looking into mutations when you can get starched genes and class freak maxed. Those are a game changer. I can’t play without marsupial anymore. The damage buffs are nice too. 
---
I didnt take the time to count the characters, but it looks like an MD5 hash. Probably a hipster developer who thinks they are clever.
---
Had this happen once on ps4 out of about 30 runs.
---
I’m trying to get the T-51 skin not the quantum skin atm.
---
There's dome 2 (alien blaster), dome 3 (nuka cola paint), and dome 7 (nuka quantum paint). 
---
Here's the bad news, I swapped 2x T60 calibrated shocks for one excavator shock. And somebody gave me the other in exchange for 6 stable violet flux units. Every vendor usually carries some mods, just be prepared to barter  and beg and you might get lucky.
---
Thanks I will check that out
---
isn't it like 4k caps? That's like 4 days of effort farming the vendors.
---
I use them for stealth commando, and they're quite powerful but very bullet hungry
---
I just ran west tek once, it only had one 1star legendary super mutant, are there usually more?
---
Sorry my friend Gave me enough to craft it I’m good now 
---
my character has a ton of mouth scars and wears a surgical mask I would love to have most of my lips/mouth ripped off 
---
i think they're waiting for the event to blow over because people will ask them about the rare mask drops even if thats not the topic 
---
Toxic valley the events, big monsters(grafton monster), and chests. It should drop from any of those, I got it from a chest in a cabin.  I can also confirm the grafton monster will drop plans, but I didn’t get deep pocketed from him.  
---
Still have one left?
---
Nope. Done the event about 40 times, and only have the five common ones.
---
It's all about keeping her on the ground by crippling her wings. A few people with good weapons and properly spec cards can handle her. I've killed her with 3 or 4 people several times. Cryo weapons and crit hits to her wings and she will die without too much trouble. Don't forget to use chems and bobbleheads when you have them.
---
If you need on ps4 or xbox I can help
---
I was watching captainoob and realised he wasn't doing this.
---
I'm going into the new mode with a brand new character.  I think it will be interesting to see my character grow in that mode. Not taking my lvl 141 over. Start off with nothing and hope for the best!
---
Which is the point the original comment was making.  People ask for proof, proof is given, but it is never enough because it doesn't align with what they *want* to believe.
---
Let's analyze that second link. The one with the goblin mask. If this person had gotten the mask from the dev room, then why do they have multiples of the witch mask as well as the common masks everyone gets? Why don't they have *all* the rare masks?  Would they really go through the trouble of hiding all the rare masks in their stash and populating their inventory with common ones in an attempt to trick everyone into thinking the rare ones are actually dropping?
---
Or, you know, have a real challenge and level a new alt in Survival mode instead of bringing over your Bloodied One Shot Screw You Lowbie character ;)
---
For real. The radiation tattoo is the only one that kinda fits, but the placement makes it terrible. I would definitely rock it on the neck.
---
You're right about what the event is for but that doesn't really excuse poor judgement in drop rates to event length or poorly worded "trade the rare masks with your friends to collect them all" though...
---
It may not be the biggest deal ever but it's another in a long line of fuck ups for this game...
---
I RP 
---
I love building and have most of the plans, even a bunch of rare ones. If you supply some building materials I run out of and give me artistic freedom to build, I would totally build you a house as long as you aren't in a fissure or high level mob spawn area. It would be like a Fallout 76 surprise home makeover.
---
I also have this mask! Have been waiting on the dog addition to the game so I can use if! 
---
You would be amazed at how easy it is to run around at 20% HP. You just have to do it and see. I've been toying with bloody weapons and perks for about a month and it's been an awesome experience. At first I did die a lot but now I feel the balance in the perks. Sneak in agility helps a lot as well as those perks that give more damage resistance when not in PA. For weapons, I've got bloody shotgun, rifle, submachine gun, and several mele and I've been toying with them all. My fav is the shotgun and rifle and I can hit them far away and move in closer with sneak and shotgun when needed. I use recently got a death claw guantlet and that sucker does over 1000 damage without mele perks equipped. So that's my next test. I'll need to max my sneak out I feel for that to be more effective. 
---
It doesn’t I’m actually just stupid and struggled to find the comb since their are so many.
---
You know, it occurs to me- ATLAS is a weather machine, as you said. Perhaps it has something to do with the mysterious Nuclear Winter coming this summer...?
---
still happening... 3/22/19
---
Yeah I have seen up to 7, 2 of them were three stars
---
He forgot to add the Wood Resource Nodes on the map, you can build Wood Extractors as well
---
Id love a Rorschach mask.
---
Yes. Please let me have dueling banjos.
---
I don’t know, maybe they only have the one left? Maybe they bought it from an exploiter? They could have sold the others or stored them, but that is irrelevant as it doesn’t provide any proof that the mask is legitimate. 
---
Proof would be showing that the mask was dropped from doing the event, there is a rewards screen at the end of every run that shows what mask you got, having an image/ video of that would be sufficient proof, but guess what no one has ever seen? 
---
I like to got whitesprings &gt; west tek &gt; watoga &gt; harpers ferry
---
20 hours after first transaction.
---
But nobody needs 60 of em, ever. I drop 5 or 10 for any player i run into most of the time
---
Truth be told I haven’t, but I’d like to. I kinda keep reconsidering it because I’ve never really seen anyone do it, but it still sounds like fun.
---
20 hours following first transaction.
---
Yeah, the challenges have become annoying, but still better than paying 10 dollars for 2 masks.
---
I'm sorry, I downvoted myself. 
---
Welp, that was ok while it lasted, it just dropped dead. Sorry everyone. 
---
Yeah I think it's fairly obvious.
---
I prefer Fallout 4 b/c Iplay BGS on PC. I can mod the hell out of it. I don't have to worry about servers going down, maintenance, or other online issues. It has become an insanely larger, almost different game now.    
---
76 was released far too soon and with too many issues. Grouping isn't as easy as you think since the 'newness' has worn off. People only group with people they know. Whitesprings and the place where the Queen comes out are the ONLY places anyone nukes anymore. Both places get so flooded with triple digit players that those who don't have tons of time to play games like me are left lacking.
---
It really just comes down to Bethesda deciding when to release it, I guess. It’ll show up eventually.
---
So about the same as a heavy machine gun like the 50 cal. You just can silence rifles
---
So true. You can see it in the posts complaining x doesn’t drop enough. the journey to x or even never getting it and making due with what you have is what makes this fun. 
---
What flora is there for violet? I'm not too familiar with area.
---
Funny thing is, the level 300+ that duo’s with a level 1, and cheers that the level 1 got a rare mask, is the luckiest person of them all.
---
Damn, would love to see you all on PC. Got this awesome Harper's Ferry Bridge build that is in desperate need of upgrading...
---
Agreed 
---
You all should really post some of your CAMPs up on here, would love to see them.

---
They don't all share, the link shows what vendors are related
---
Yes, and a way smaller clip
---
Upvoted because true. So much fun dealing high damage/receiving high damage. Sneaky sneaky.
---
Depends. There's still more content in any one area than all of Anthem, but YMMV. If you hated it before I don't think the current limited time event will win you over, but there is new content coming in. 
---
Combine chem feind with like 3-4 +25% damage increasing chems, and some PER+ chems on a vats sniper build. Holy balls, you feel powerful. Best way for my build to stalk assholes running bloodied who harass people at Fasnacht.
---
I would like to make an addendum to your part about duping:
---
The most prevalent, early on dupe was one you could do in FO4; the artillery trick. Shy of having the Dogmeat dupe, this was one of the earliest dupes in FO4. I know, I duped in 4. 
---
But when it came to the online version, and I heard people were using it again/still, I stayed away. This is not my first online rodeo, so I knew better. 
---
But if the mechanic existed in the bones of the game; not to mention the “infinite” carry weight glitch, plus shear *real* infinite carry weight, which both (former a glitch, latter just part of the game), why were these not excised before launch?
---
It would be funny if there were no uber  infrequent  masks and that Bethesda is using this event to flush out the people that took them from the Dev room ;)
---
The easy way to do it is to get a new character. 
---
There’s a new type of drum at the station in Welch...
---
Thank you for brining this up. A lot of dailies have been locked behind Biv RNG. Like that Mountain moonshine one from the other day. How can I craft something for the daily if I don't have that recipe from Biv yet? 
---
Ay, you updated and in the end, that's what really matters. 
---
I run around as a Union Soldier deleting enemies with my Blackpowder weapons. Bayonet charging is fun, and using Unyielding armor/bloodied build is great.
---
Like maybe its been keeping nuclear winter at bay, it breaks, and now WV freezes over?
---
By far the easiest thing I learned to do electricity was to get the Advance Power Connector plans.
---
There is a Power Conduit Radiator that is basically a bubble of power that effects lights and such.
---
And it looks a lot nicer when you line the little power pipes into the corners and crevasses of the house instead of a ton of messy wires, and it has connectors that work with the standard wiring system.
---
There is also a power conduit pipe that has a wall pass-through piece that can be wired to generators, allowing you to power you home from inside or out without cheesing wires through walls and windows, (which is something I've seen a few YouTube videos suggest when learning wiring).
---
It dropped a Bloodied Grognak's for me today. Level 30 of course, but I guess someone might want it.
---
I've never paid attention to that danger meter so much. Once I figured out what I could get away with it was game over. The enemy can walk right passed me most of the time and not even see me until its too late. It's such a fun and rewarding build. I'm just not dedicated enough to stick with one or two weapons. Maybe one day. I love my submachine gun too much to give up my perception points just yet. I could see myself with rifle mele only soon though. 
---
You just need some teammates to share the cost burden and provide more fast travel options. Even when I'm footing the bill for my whole team's treasure map runs the extra fast travel options make it pretty cheap. So cheap, I don't mind. 
---
And like previous posters have said, I never spend more than, well for me, 64 caps, to hit all the vendors (when I'm solo). I think you may need a better route. 
---
Even if I didn’t work I wouldn’t be able find the free time to get all the ingredients to craft 50 alcoholic drinks in a day. Well maybe I could, but it wouldn’t be how I’d want to be spending my free time. 
---
That said, I’m not big on atomic shop purchased anyway. 
---
https://imgur.com/5yoVdLO.jpg https://imgur.com/O3RYckK.jpg some proof for the doubters
---
Sorry to hear you got hit by raiders, it seems like you have a high charisma build, may your luck be just as high. 
---
In all seriousness though, hope things start looking up soon, glad you and yours are safe.
---
I play as traveling merchant. Khajiit has wares, if you have coin!
---
F that. This has been a ray of sunshine in in the nuclear winter of my soul. 
---
 had half my armor go back to stash. Relog a couple times and check it.
---
Doesn't mean you have to throw out variety out the window.
---
I can't wait to live up to my character's backstory.
---
Got a bloodied meat hook level 30 to and doing 1000 ish damage on my build 
---
This is exactly what I thought of when I first heard that song. It would be great to have for the camp. At least have two variants of the jukebox like the radio does. 
---
Your point only works for casual or new players. People who have sunk a ton of time in now only have the dailies and weeklies to focus. 
---
Lol, thanks for making me smile despite all this. 
---
Pretty sure it activated with my lever rifle, although I've been playing my shotgun character lately so I can't be certain. The chance might be dependent on condition loss per shot: Lever rifles last forever anyway, so the chance per shot would be low.
---
These types of replies are driving me nuts. 😆
---
Too bad but what does that have to do with Fallout?
---
I like the event. I got an owl mask. I'm happy. AND I got to see my first mega sloth which I immediately felt awful for killing because I love sloths a d it has such a sweet face. 
---
How much is that mod with 7 Charisma and max Hard Bargain? Wait is the plans in the bunker vendor now?
---
To give an example of how to light up light bulbs with Adv.Pow.Con;
---
You place an adv.con connector near your generator and wire them together using ∆ on ps4 and ¥ on Xbox, then connect Adv.Con pipes to the connector along the floor or ceiling till you get where your light is.
---
There are a few sizes, bends, and splits you can use to get where you need to go.
---
Place a Power conduit Radiator nearby and anything in the vicinity like lights or TVs should recurve power.
---
Pc?
---
Bloodied sucks for PVP anyway
---
After all events are over. 
---
.
---
I spawned into two nuke areas and was nuked once
---
This is what I do. Nuka-cherry and quantum are way better than stimpacks
---
Great thanks
---
I have a lot of weapons I use, but try to stay with Blackpowder; the pocket .50 cal is fun though.
---
Fallout 76 is preparing for the Fallout X DC crossover event lol.
---
However not as convenient as the hotkey button for stimpacks sometimes
---
400-700? My level 50 bloodied power fist does upwards of 1600k with no items used. Heck my meat hook almost does 1k and its level 30
---
This just happened to me. Before I realized it I had lost hundreds of caps. Thanks for the post I was very confused and this helped clear everything. I'm not to high level and the greifers were 279 killing me non stop. They had taken over the junk yard near flat-woods and was killing me in-town. I would Also like to point out they could also kill my team mate who never fired a shot. Very unfair ='[
---
What kinda damage do you get from the black powder. I haven't come across a bloody one of those yet. 
---
Talking about ranged weapons 
---
Do you have pictures of previous projects? 
---
[Settings &gt; Audio &gt; set your voice chat mode to "area". Turn push to talk "off" 
---
Default chat is team I believe. Makes it so you can only hear people on your team. Beware: if you play on a team, and your voice setting is on area, you wont be able to hear your teammate unless they are also set to area. 
---
Platform and Gamer Tag so people can find you. I may have missed it, bit did not think I saw one. Cheers
---
Low level bloody are actually still really good. You can use them early and they still scale high with the right build at higher levels. 
---
I can't play the game? I was looking forward to getting to play the event and now I cant. 
---
I rp as the cannibal clown of Helvetia currently although used be the leader of the Moth Man cult
---
if they do exist people would sell them on ebay for tons of money
---
Idk about that faschnaut (I can’t spell) attracted a few bloodied jerks every time I’ve played it so far but maybe being off guard is why.  Idk Bethesda doesn’t make FPS and you can tell by the gunplay in this game (which is terrible) but there’s enough features to where you can have a fun shootout without any abilities on the guns you could have long battles that last for hours that way.
---
Bloodied builds mean everyone is gonna die because 
---
1) they have no fuckin health
---
2) they’re pumping out 4 digit damage numbers
---
Idk I just think survival will probably just be a lot of people running identical builds but it’s not like I have concrete evidence no one does until they release the beta 
---
for an outfit, all I was is a good looking duster, not a minutemen reskin thing. similar to this https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/b/b4/CourierDusterYesMan.png/revision/latest?cb=20110925232345
---
Don't worry, you're not losing much. I mean, it's fun and all but not worth crying over.
---
It's gonna make you craft something while drunk. 
---
As someone with the same weapon and a build you honestly don’t need to stay at 20%. Staying at even 50 with the right build does way more then enough damage to one shot most things 
---
I am completely interested. I’m on PS4
---
Did you drop it or otherwise remove it from your inventory at any point before disconnection?
---
Check the top posts, this has been brought up a lot
---
Can you build the fusion  generator for me? Do you know the mats needed?
---
Didn’t know I browse by new
---
Must have been mutated fern
---
THIS. Sure I get that it's a theme, but can we have just a few non-booze related goals?
---
We need sheet music that we learn like new recipes. Then when we play the instrument, we choose which song we want to play. Different songs would give different buffs.
---
If you're on PS4, I can craft you one kitted out if you have the mats. 
---
I haven't truly witnessed the bloodied variants(impossible to find legit sellers) but my TSE Blackpowder pistol does ~500 per 2 second reload, my explosive rifle does ~750 per 5 second reload, and my TSE Dragon does 1191 per 10 second reload. I bought a bloodied Dragon today, and it does ~1300 damage. I have adrenal reaction so everything gets buffed more than bloodied. 
---
Suck my penis

No way to tag or indicate.

RP is a bunch of small communities. Its hard to link up with people. Its hard to find the group of people who want to do the same kind of roleplay.
---
Ive met a few groups, im in one. Some groups give quests, some do meet ups, some just dont break character on the mic (enclave/BOS). Theres a few raider roleplay gangs that run a tounge &amp; cheek shakedown/pvp scanario on players. (Nice camp you got there, shame if something would happen to it, gimme Some adhesive and i wont STICK around! Give us some rubber and we'll BOUNCE outta here) If you drop 1 adhesive they leave you alone, if not they break your camp. Other people just run a tavern or a shop.
---
Your best bet is to be mic active &amp; try a roleplay schtick on everyone. Youll eventually meet someone who plays along and may know or have a small roleplay group. Get ready for some rejection though. Most players dont roleplay. But it isnt hard to find if you approach people with whatever gimmick you wanna run. 
---
The game is a really really good template for roleplay. Lots of costumes, customizable locations, area chat... Im suprised roleplay isnt more popular.
---
PC may have the most roleplayers.
---
He's so drunk he keeps forgetting to give me the new recipes when I complete the daily. I feel like I can't get mad because it's totally in character.
---
I was thinking about that recently. Do you think enough damage resistance perks could help or would sneak, chameleon armor play a factor. I would think as a bloody player, I would have to constantly use stealth boys and chameleon armor since I can't get ahold of any Sent armor worth a damn. I may dabble a little in PvP but I'm definitely not prepared for it as many other are. I'll try it out but I don't have any prospects in it being worth while for me in the long run until I get better gear. 
---
Just sold one the other night, turn in technical docs
---
vendors reset every 20 hours for you. if you sell at 8pm then the next day at 4 pm all caps will be reset for you. you can get 1400 caps a day from all vendors combined . 
---
I had this same problem for a long time. Bethesda Support was unhelpful to say the least. 
---
First of all, are you running a single graphics card, or are you running one to your monitor and another to aid with PhysEx, (etc.) 
---
Are you using a single monitor, or a multi monitor setup? 
---
What cable do you use from your graphics card to your primary monitor? 
---
Lastly, have you verified that your text size setting is set to 100% in windows settings? 
---
I found a fix for my specific situation, but I would be interested to see if there is any overlap between us that may be triggering the problem. 
---
If you craft a flamer you get 100 fuel. I'm guessing that's the amount you're supposed to get from crafting fuel but for some reason you get it from crafting actual flamers. 
---
Also it won't tell you that you've recieved 100 fuel but if you check your inventory it'll be there.
---
Hopefully you too can be one step closer towards igniting Appalachia! 
---
Note: for some reason the legendary only glows green for the first 5 seconds or so. After that you can tell it is legendary targeting it and see it in the name. 
---
I’ve heard you get them through turning in technical data. I suggest one at a time since it doesn’t change your reward if you put more in. 
---
No shit, right. 
---
Idk how this is gonna come out I'm On my phone but, i wrote here about Advanced Power Conduits, the radiator, and how to set them up for lights.

I mean I'm not crying over it, but it was just really a kick in the balls when I was already down when I came home to it trashed, and then to find stuff missing that I had been looking forward to. I felt like I lost quite a bit, despite how you feel. I also lost a family revolver, my wife's wedding rings that she had taken off cause her hands swell, makeup, and some medication. Possibly some other things that we havent found yet in the mess. 
---
Or perhaps the reverse. It activates and causes the weather to go crazy.
---
I finally got to it and someone decided to Nuke the area. 
---
No it was currently equipped had just fast traveled back to my camp. Before disconecting. Not im my stash or inventory 
---
Ive had it happen to me before i went to enter a chassis and it just froze i couldnt move at all. Also had a wierd bug yesterday i entered my power armour and the chassis just disapeared and i was just walking around with just the armour pieces and wouldnt let me exit the power armour its very strange.
---
My combat shotty does over 500 a shot and with 8 rounds constant that's a good deal in close quarters without reloading. My explosive lever is pretty close to that with the Dem exp perk card at level 1. I don't think I could handle the black powder reload times though. It would be tough running Wes Tek with it. 
---
I'm looking forward to running around giving food to people. I think it could be fun trying to make friends in survival, instead of just killing anything that moves.
---
Funny coincidence. My idea for when they add player vending is to RP a rogue Mothman Cultist turned shady businessman.
---
“Mmm, technically the High Priest says we are not to trade with Outsiders... but he and most of my brothers are dead or Scorched anyway, so what he doesn’t know... -cackles-“
---
You shut your mouth
---
No worries i should not have jumped to assuming you were a pacifist, I happen to like that workshops trigger pvp and yes im one of those terrible people that hunt people across the map because im a pvp player and I find it enjoyable tracking them across the map like an assassin.It’s already quite hard to find pvp in this game and its my fav aspect of it, so any changes to the game mechanics that make that even harder im not on board with, hopefully the new servers will change that tho. Like I said in the game mechanics you have consented to pvp by claiming a workshop and i dont agree with that being changed and yes i know im in the minorty.
---
What platform? I like trying to build stuff every now and then. I'm not a master by any means though.
---
The secret is crouching behind cover, vats because high unyielding stats giving good vats use, and pop a shot, reload, pop another shot, if they get too close retreat or use the pistol with faster reloading. It's pretty fun. I'm going to spec into that agility perk for vats swapping targets with more damage per swap, get those chains going. 1 hit kills for days.
---
I know what your getting at but imagine if you could only get unusuals for one week a year the drop rates were even lower and instead of paying to open crates you had to spend your time earning the same five hats for hours with no guarantee that the unusuals even exist.
---
Never. Banned is banned. You fucked up, you gotta take the punishment.
---
You could also create a new account. If you do, don't do the thing that got you banned.
---
I like the idea a lot, it would mean traveling all over to make a couple better dishes with it. It would also be cool if we had a freezer that would stop spoiling all together but you would have to wait for it to thaw before you could use it
---
Hopefully you have homeowners or renters insurance, as the case may be. I’ll bet the d-bags get caught and you get your stuff back. They’ll try to pawn it and get caught, or they’ll pull a job and make a mistake and get caught, or someone will have a camera where they pull a job and they’ll get caught, or something. 
---
Hopefully also your PD is decent also and will do a good investigation or catch them while on patrol or something.
---
If you go into the menu theirs a section called photo gallery. You can delete pictures you don't want in the loading screens.

Does it have a little tank on the back?

If you're hurting for 5.56, try taking the converted ammo factory up North. 
---
I went from no 5.56 to unloading my handmade rifle into radtoads without hesitation. 
---
I’ve seen it a few times and usually take pics with them when I see them. Sometimes I’m odd places I wouldn’t expect to see them. 
---
You mean for launching a nuke? I've not done it yet and I'm on PC. I'm Yaosio if you want to party up and do the last quest. There's some secrets with hacking and lock picking that make it easier.
---
That sounds great! What do you play on?
---
Man, I sorry to hear that. The same thing happened to me last summer. The insurance company just makes it worse, they give a fraction of what your stuff was worth.
---
Nah it aint rare seems to be the only mask ive been getting..
---
Someone else offered some good insights on the event. Will post a link. 
---
Lol. I git unbanned. Not everyone who was banned was guilty. This community is a Kangaroo court. 
---
Probably just wait til the 1 year anniversary. At least a vault or 2 will be opened hopefully and then the game should be streamlined by then.
---
I can help. I'm Yaosio in the game. What time can you play? I'm available most of the day except around lunch time because I like to eat! Maybe we can get two more and make a full party!
---
When I get home I'll log in, and see what I get.
---
I put in a ticket with Bethesda and got unbanned after a few weeks.

---
Question, is that a functional cooking stove or just decorative?
---
Yeah, I can understand that. Mostly What I suggested I think would work well in Adventure, but I would love to keep the current system for survival.
---
Im actually looking forward to survival because I appreciate the, horror movie-esque, feeling of being in a free for all Post Apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Never sure if I'm meeting someone to befriend or someone to behead, will this shack have a guy waiting to gank me? I'm happy for the survival beta and looking forward to dying a bunch😄
---
Im not an expert, but Build looks good. Only thing I might change is throwing one or two more points in agility if you can sacrifice them from elsewhere. That extra AP is great when you combine it with concentrated fire(P)
---
Electricity "flows" through floors and walls a certain distance. This way you don't have to put a connector on every single time. Lights will actually turn on and off dynamically as you move them around. This will let you see where you need to add another connector without guessing.
---
We should play together. Both sneaky sneaky lol. 
---
I would love a Sea of Thieves style quartet harmony thing between friends.
---
What are the conditions in the code? I’ve only been able to tame single spawns at random spawn locations, but would love to be able to tame others from elsewhere.
---
Ahhhh I get it
---
I got a lvl 35 bloodied pitchfork that i use now to kill radtoads and varments during the event.
---
Great response 
---
If you need your serial number (for reporting it stolen or whatever) you can find it for your xbox on the account site (https://account.microsoft.com/). Also you can see if anyone logs into your account through that Xbox (shows approximate location and IP address).
---
Yeah, kind if
---
Like, a metal brace or collar around the neck area too yeah?
---
Been awhile since I’ve put it on, lol
---
I'm calling that the "Anthem Plan". 
---
Have you made any manual changes to your fo76 preferences or config file? I did and my performance died after the last patch until I deleted them.
---
If not, check out the graphics setting. I would bring everything down one notch. Max textures require over 6 GB of VRAM, so watch out for that. For grass/object distance you can bring them down fairly far without actually seeing the distance decrease but you'll get a performance boost 
---
No it’s the engineering one. I was able to finally find a picture of it on google 
---
Just found one there today too 
---
They're not rare, they're broken.
---
I've played the event at least 30 times now and have not received the yellow one, the jester, the bug, the skull thing, or old man winter. Nor have I seen any of them in the inventories of the 50+ people I have traded with, nor has anyone on the F76 subreddit come forward and said with proof that they have any of them.
---
Bethesda doesn't know what they're talking about if they say they're dropping, because they aren't. Nobody has them. 
---
*No, I’m doesn’t!*
---
The suspension email states that all suspensions will be lifted once issues with duping have been addressed. 
---
There's no real date in mind, so i just recommend to keep an eye on Reddit till then. I imagine when people actually get unsuspended there will be a few post talking about it. 
---
The solution is to play a better game.
---
Just a fun fact.
---
In West Virginia there's something called a Roadkill BBQ. It's 100% legit.
---
Did you make any manual changes to your Fallout config or preference files? I did and performance died until I deleted the files and let the game remake them.
---
Update:  earlier this evening I jumped on, and had server disconnect,etc as others have reported.  After a few server hops with no improvement, I reset my router and PC.  After logging back in a few minutes later, it was fine.  Played about 3 hours, including about 5 Fashnact events, no issues except on one server the event was already in progress and I didn’t see the bot marchers until they started marching.  They just popped into my view one at a time then all good.  
---
I forgot 1; pipboy
---
FO3 and FONV are still my favourites and I love FO76 too, just for different reasons.
---
Running around at 19hp is fun. It’s like hard mode with high reward for not dying. But you get used to dying too lol
---
I put my fusion generator on the roof and all the lights work. Wire down to a conduit on the roof then over the edge to the water purifier.
---
I've played the event at least 30 times now and have not received any of them. Nor have I seen any of them in the inventories of the 50+ people I have traded with, nor has anyone here come forward and said with proof that they have any of them. They're bugged. They aren't dropping.
---
Word to the wise. I wouldn't do the main quest until you level up more. Get that maxed out Zealots Flaming 10mm and All Rise. You have plenty of time to do the quests. I did all my quests way too early. 
---
I couldn't possibly have any less interest in Pvp. 
---
I don't understand the common criminal anymore. Why risk yourself to steak a few electronic items that have very little to no resale? All that trouble for what? A couple hundred dollars if you're lucky to find someone to buy it? I'm surprised there isn't any sort of"LoJack" system on electronics. Buddy of mine had a TV with Amazon Fire built into it stolen and they were able to track the IP to location out of state. 
---
Which ones are considered rare? Just bought 76 2 days ago and have the monster, witch, and owl.
---
Depends where you are. Most just pass you by like strangers on the street. There are lots though.
---
lol you guys hack. Not too interested in getting shredded by hackers. (100% armor ignoring and was attacking you both to no damage yields, on a live stream, give me a reason not to send that up to Bethesda)
---
Hey, I know it’s a weird question but what is that “Responders” tag by your name and how would someone go about getting one?
---
&gt;	I'm bad at being charismatic
---
We all fail charisma checks sometimes. 
---
Where do you even get the plans for the brew station?

Yes they do.

Sadly, I have not played them. I only have FO4 as a frame of reference.

Awesome thanks

Switch to carnivore ionized meat strategy

I don't know if we even met the minimum amount of damages, I have to do some calling tomorrow. The most expensive things taken were the Xbox, games, and wedding rings, and her rings were just silver. It's just going to be in my head all day tomorrow when I'm cleaning instead of going to work and gaming. Just absolutely trashed my place. Flipped the queen mattress, pulled out the couch, dumped out all the boxes we hadn't even unpacked yet that didn't even have anything of any value really in them. Broke some drinking glasses, just emptied everything of every shelf on the floor in every room.
---
Jester, old man winter, monster with a lot of teeth, and sun. The beret is rare but at least more than 4 people have gotten it. 😊
---
Hopefully it's a visual glitch. I've seen post about that here.

I’ve been in Appalachian Antiques a ton to look for the brotherhood drops but I’ve never seen them. Exactly which shelf am I looking for?
---
They were just blown away by your performance and hadn’t seen anything like it since the 2060’s
---
This makes me want to watch Kill Bill.
---
What sort of fucking bullshit is this?
---
*budum tiss*
---
It’s pretty random. I’ve gotten some of my fav items off of legendary animals lately. 
---
😃 see you out there then haha
---
I got my house broke into before. They took 7 firearms and a few credit cards. It’s an indescribable feeling. Being anal raped is probably the only thing that could make a man feel more violated lol. Hopefully you can get your stuff back. If not then just take comfort in knowing that karma is a bitch and they’ll end up in prison or they’ll get shot by a homeowner and in a short period of time you’ll be no worse for the wear. Good luck to you.
---
I’d have to say that the music in the 2070’s were quite repetitive
---
They stack with each weapon class. 1st level shotgunner, expert, and master give you +30. If you combine shotgunner into level 2 you only get +15. So get all three level ones before you level any of them up. Same goes for all weapon classes 
---
Also all the ghouls are bloated and glowing but aren’t dropping hardened mass and that kind of stuff. 
---
Stats?
---
That's so awful dude.. I'm SO sorry... I'm glad your pets are okay and all but it's still hard to lose things, and I hope whoever stole your stuff gets a swift kick in the ass from karma soon... You are still welcome here, game or not, of course, but it's still really sad to hear this and I hope you will be okay... Take care...
---
Not everyone wants to live in a ugly tin can so no thanks
---
havent played this game since launch. feeling like i shouldnt bother?
---
Have someone join your team who can build. 
---
FO3 and FONV are far more story and atmosphere oriented.  If you liked catching up on the lore or FO76 then FO3 and FONV (FO3 in particular when it comes to atmosphere) take that aspect and put it on steroids, not to mention that they both have a more obvious main storyline.
---
Gunplay is pretty outdated and clunky though but the exploration alone makes it worthwhile.
---
Don't worry. That crazy thief is going to break right back into your home and bring Fallout 76 back. He might not bring back anything else though. ;)
---
Once you get the toothy man and the beret, that's it outside of the plans and recepies. The others are bugged. 
---
Even still, we should be able to store caps to keep them safe, I’ll be storing Stimpacks and water, and I’d like to store some caps too. 
---
And for the record, I don’t use bloodied/unyeilding, mines and automatic rifle build (I can’t stand melee), not many about :)
---
Well, shit.
---
I guess I cant be mad about the spoiler on a game as old as zork, but I wasnt expecting to stumble upon a spoiler in a Fallout thread...
---
I’m a homeless guy with a Freddie crougar gauntlet, nobody can beat my level of evil.
---
I didn’t even know someone could do that lol the wasteland is a lonely one for me 
---
They did the same to us. They threw everything in the bedrooms on the floor and then walked on it all.
---
My wife was pretty upset, worried they'd come back.
---
I would recommend Wyze cameras if you want some inexpensive wifi security cams you can run anywhere. They're like $20 bucks each, and you can link up to 6.
---
Spam collect dirty water and boil it. Also hunt animas for meat and cook it. Water purifiers are nice I have 6 in my camp. I always have water. Also as previously mentioned Ionized meat with carnivore is the best.
---
Huh
---
All you people that cry over the masks! I have put close to 1000h into this game ...not 1 godrolled weapon or armor as a drop ( not even close to a godroll ) . Its rng , please accept it o stop grinding the event. 
---
That seems a bit excessive.
---
Prioritize finding the further away robots and getting their chores done first. That way they’ll have more time to get in line while you do the others.
---
God I wish we could add overseerers stash boxes to our camps so we can easily give away free stuff.
---
Also keep doing the good work!
---
I was just forced to test this and it worked.  It took me to a spot north west of Grafton.  I was not prepared to fight a Scorchbeast.
---
It's my dad's place, he has homeowners. Just been in a rough patch from some health problems for both me and my wife, and then when things start to get better this happens. 
---
I'm hoping they are dumb enough to just take it to a pawn shop. We are going to get cameras after this. Which aren't cheap either. 
---
And the PD is decent, just not enough of them over a rural area. They came and took pictures and tried to get prints but didn't get anything. 
---
Way Too Long!!!
---
I load up my pics to OneDrive so I don't have to totally ditch them. I keep a few on hand for loading screens.
---
I won't be on much longer, but next time I'll load you up with Molotovs and we can hit up Whitesprings some more
---
There are some junk items like baseballs and beer bottles that won't be auto-scrapped because they're used for other recipes. However, none of these items are very rare, so normally you scrap everything unless you're actively using that recipe.
---
Same, especially with the sloth. Seems it finally filtered through that killing bugs and wolves for better chances at a mask is a better reward than a level 30 leather right leg
---
'Whoever' was correct here, no need to church it up!
---
You sir are twisted, sick and in serious need of counseling.   
---
Where do I sign up for quarterly finals for “the toss” ?
---
RIP Craig. 
---
I know how you feel i once had a partner followed me on my daily travels looking after the cave we became great friends in the lonely wasteland that took our homes and forced us to the cave. Unfortunitly his time came to an end when a lvl 22 axed him to death. If only i could have used a stim 
---
Same here I don’t feel bad now to know that we are on the same boat 
---
&gt;There have been quests that in some cases could not be completed without waiting for a server reset or server hopping. This is an accurate statement which can be verified with research or experience. Stating "nor is it relevant today, since they were fixed a long time ago" only serves to confirm that this type of problem has occurred and validates the assertion; but...
---
No, it's not an accurate statement. It's literally 100% factually untrue. It was entirely and 100% possible to complete those quests without a server reset or server hopping before the patch; and after the patch it was entirely fixed.  This is an accurate statement which not only can be verified with research but literally first-hand personal experience.    
---
If your sole purpose for posting here was to call attention to something that you don't appear to understand either the history nor the details of, then why are you here?
---
Thanks, I found out the thing with the serial number cause I didn't have pictures (genius, I know). I just don't know which Xbox is the one I had that wouldn't read disks and which was the one I had for years now. And I already changed my password, should I have not done that? And I didn't know about the location and ip address thing, I'll have to watch
---
Sometimes, maybe even most times, after a nuke zone has expired, nuked flora and glowing ones still respawn. It's been happening since release.
---
I wish there were alternate texture with the stair with platform deal. Why can it only be wire mesh? Why not wood planks or astroturf or linoleum???
---
Not looking to delete it. Just saying that the daily was pretty forward in its suggestion.
---
excellent!
---
It equates to a 0.02 chance to drop so technically you are both right 😂
---
Agreed, I wish there were more alternates for the garage door too. The warehouse texture is so ugly.
---
Oh no, definitely change password because they could fuck with your account and stuff. I think it even shows sign in attempts too (not sure if attempts through an XB1 show though).
---
You're missing the point. They're pointing out that there's no validity to the 0.2% number.
---
Hhmmm....I have quite a few caps right now. I could probably buy them if I found them on a vendor. Do you know how much the plans were?
---
Although I'd recommend maxing out the first perk unless you're undecided about which weapons you're using. There's often a dead spot for perks before level 30 and you'll need the extra damage for Whitesprings.
---
Gotcha. Well, these “fine people” aren’t rocket scientists. They’ll mess up, some where, some time. Just a matter of when. If the local police/sheriff are good they’ll get tips or something. And there are cameras everywhere it seems so that is a possibility at a future house. Plus it sounds like maybe you can track the XBOX via online so that might give some leads. Good luck.
---
mole rat teeth for upgrading the glove, cooking oil for the doughnut 
---
Who defines "poor judgment in drop rates"? 
---
Jesus Christ dude, what’s your problem?!
---
I come across alot on the servers. 
---
I should really pick up that Plan then. Maybe super duper will offset the additional material cost and make it a good source. 
---
There's the whitesprings vendor, who sells a lot. They're really expensive though, at least compared to other CAMP plans.
---
I too have seen them. The first time I found the note I was a low level. Since then, I see them everywhere. They are not always in the same place, and they are never far from where I am. 
---
I do not know why, but I guess I have always taken them for granted. I wonder what it means. Are there others?
---
I am gonna come tear your base up. 
---
Confirmation bias, thy name is Ka1n.
---
Sometimes the flora is still there after nuke zone disappeared. 
---
Make a camp and get crops. Cook said crops into soup: these do hp, water, and food.
---
I didn’t need plans, but you do have to complete the first “brewing” quests for  biv (the one where you find the ingredients for nukashine). After that, the brew station shows up in the crafting section when your in the build mode while in your camp.
---
Yeah! Never ever pick up a brown paper bag off the ground! That's Bugthesda trying to trap ban you! Lol
---
Wow. I didn't know that existed. I'll be sure to hit it up. Thanks!
---
I don’t even bother with the sloth anymore, I’m keeping focused on keeping the bots alive in the last attack. Even if I just get a standard mask I’m ok with it, since this is the only way to get them I’ll be able to sell them for caps in a few months to people who didn’t have the game right now
---
Radaway counts as being intoxicated, and IIRC, lasts longer than alcohol. 
---
Look into nvidias GeForce now/next. Its free and streams games from steam really really well. I played battlefield 5 at school lmao
---
Can confirm. I have left many warehouse keys behind in random locations. 
---
Especially since faction vendors share the same pool of caps
---
Life's a lot more fun when you pull the huge stick out of your ass. Trust me- I was a bitchy little teenager for a long time too. 
---
Only room they didn't touch really was the bathroom. Which is tiny and nothing to trash was in there. 
---
Wife doesn't feel safe at all, wanted to spend the night at her parents. After I got here I wanted to just leave too. Had to clear a path to the bed and move everything off and back into place just to try to sleep. Which I should be doing, but I'm just too frustrated.
---
And I'll look into that, was looking at lorex and ring. 
---
Just wondering.. what’s the tier list for mask rarity? 
---
Is the owl just ridiculously common?  
---
There is actually a [small daily quest where you gather food to be grilled.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Thrill_of_the_Grill)
---
Also I'd like to add something.....NOT ATOM SHOP ITEMS. Thanks. 
---
Sounds awesome.  I’m a little jealous.
---
I just started the game and am always really afraid to join in on the event because I don't want higher levels to be nasty :( 
---
"ITS A TRAP"
---
Nope the dev's said everything is dropping normally. They wouldn't lie to us or anything or not know what they're talking about. They've never messed up something like this so itll be fine.
---
Ive been in that spot since October. Looks like you did well with it. I also have the vault boy on the stones with a lihht shining on him.
---
Sorry to hear about what happened. I'm glad your pets were not hurt. Everything else could be replaced except your family and pets. I hope they find the scumbags.
---
Also sorry there's always one asshole in the comments. That jackass probably still lives with Mommy and Daddy. I know that doesn't help but still....
---
I remember the first time I saw someone nuke there. I’m standing at a red light and see a guy sprinting away...followed by about 10 glowing ones a few seconds later. I was laughing so hard 
---
I was mining in Hemlock holes and the Mining Exibit (Southwest ash heap), 3 oil and acid resources each. But it’s time consuming, and you might get ganked by a team. Especially lately.
---
Perks and legendary effects are going to be min-maxed regardless of what’s available. People will just move onto the next best thing if it gets nerfed/removed.
---
Could it be based on number of projectiles ejected from the weapon? Shotgun pellets would explain the increased frequency. 
---
Get a better safe.
---
I don't either. They did seem to prioritize medications, cash weapons, and new stuff. Ignored the wife's old laptop, my tablet, 3ds, TVs, ds lite. Like the resale value of what they took they could make in a few hours working at minimum wage doing next to nothing 
---
That would be pretty cool even if they didn’t have unique buffs, but I like the idea.
---
Hmm, I did that one like 4 days ago and it worked fine. 
---
I know what it's like. Worst two days of vacation I've ever spent. We slept on an air matress for a couple nights until we got everything laundered and put back.
---
Personally, I have no issues buying out the vendors every day. Extra food, junk, trash legendary items etc.
---
With the way the vendors work, having a collective total of 1400 a day, selling ammo only really makes it easier in that it requires less grinding to do your vendor run each day. It doesn't introduce caps to the economy any faster.
---
doing this causes a major/frustrating bug with power armor. yes. you get no max frame rate... but that's not always a good thing. in fo76, if your frame rates are higher than your monitor refresh rate, then the power armor will often not respond to your movement keys (especially indoors). you'll just be stuck there smashing WASD while rooted. 
---
and to my knowledge, there's no way to manually set a max frame rate (to 118 for example) while iPresentInterval=0
---
Agreed but why isn't Bethesda telling people they aren't dropping and if they are dropping not showing proof? 
---
My camps are generally 4 walls and a roof. I created a second character and an online friend joined my team and build that character's camp. It's much better. 
---
I heard you can farm dupers and get all kinds of 3* rifles...bos armor...and just about anything else you can afford with caps. They usually hangout at whitesprings or the overseers camp...Happy Hunting.
---
je trouve ca tres bizarre, ont a exactement la même chose je pense qu'il ya quelque chose derriere ceci
---
Decide if you wanna do either shotgun or rifle. They are two different perk card stacks. 
---
Vending machines coming soon. 
---
Salad has rocket fuel too. I’ll smoke, you can drink diet soda
---
I got powerful people on my side we nuked a dude for being a dick xD
---
Ok, glad I did that. Also don't have any credit card info on the account anyways, but I don't want to lose control of it, it has years of gaming achievements, very few digital purchases, and supposedly the progress of games I've deleted and not reinstalled yet on my Xbox one where I ran out of room and hadn't gotten more storage yet. Haven't tested that yet. 
---
I find it very weird, have exactly the same thing I think there is something behind this, a secret quest maybe ?
---
I've gotten the giant, toothy, soldier, owl, witch also thos are not buged
---
Where is this?
---
They really need to lock down the base game and flesh out some current locations before they start adding more. They’re definitely moving in the right direction, but I’d be surprised if we get any map additions in 2019.
---
About half the time when they fix one duplication method, they somehow inadvertently open back up a previously “fixed” method.  About a week ago there was some method (since patched) involving selling stuff to a vendor to dupe.  Hasn’t heard of that one before, but I don’t actively try to find out what people are currently using, either.
---
ran into her on the road by power plant far east mid map on rout 66
---
I've seen the jester 
---
All water purifiers of the same type are linked it's a bug. So make one of each type, you're now covered on water, you will have so mutch you will have to sell the extra to vendors for caps. At the start of each play session go to flatwoods kill the cows server hop kill them again for meat, equip super duper craft rib eye steaks your now covered for food for the entire day and have extra carry weight for the day. It takes 5 minutes and even with speed demon burning them at a faster rate you're good.
---
Maxing out shotgunner only gives you +20. Where if you got each level 1 shotgunner, expert, and master you get +30. After that you can upgrade your perk cards 
---
I couldn't do the strength test on whiskey. It simply woudln't register kills.
---
Then I relogged and the "Strength test" changed to an intelligence test which I passed. 
---
Hope this helps
---
Most logical unpopular opinion I have ever heard
---
Since the last nerf?
---
Maybe for you. I have two sons, a gf, and run a business. I don't have time to amass that much stuff to sell everyday. You have the best point of all of everyone though.
---
I mean technically speaking you could make a new character and just speed level it...
---
But I agree on the recipe ones. I also agree that they atoms are too expensive and they seem to be making it harder to get atoms.
---
THEN IT SHALL BE A BATTLE FOR THE AGES 
---
Dude! This is so cool! I can't even imagine building something like this!
---
I can craft it on PC
---
Maybe repairing or keeping the balloons alive may play a part, letting some bots die, maybe you have to do it in a certain amount of time?
---
In my opinion, you are incorrect. The facts of what I describe are easily verifiable. I will no longer respond to your posts.
---
I will be 17 in June. I love fallout and would love to meet more players. I am on PS4 and cannot guarentee activity in the Discord.
---
Yea, hopefully. Just out here there aren't any cameras. Population of the town I live 15 mins from is less than 2k. Just a caution light in town. The county seat is 7k that's a bit further out that has the police. And its mostly old houses and trailers out here. In a 50s farmhouse right now. Surprised they didnt destroy the original back door breaking in. Got a big sheet of glass in it. Hoping I can track the Xbox though. Just gotta keep updating the police and waiting.
---
If they went after meds, especially heavy stuff, then that tells you what they’re into. The other stuff is just to sell to fund them.
---
Oh god 
---
I counter with a picture of every fat coworker you know with health problems holding a diet soda in their chubby fingers. 
---
I've noticed that the lucky break perk procs more when I'm getting hit by a shotgun. I'm guessing it's for similar reasons. 
---
Rose would have been great as a radio personality for a station.  Also the Lord of the Rings MMO had basic playable instruments IIRC.
---
Drug addicts/junkies will rob anyone even for a dollar because they get desperate and need cash for a quick fix. They aren't in their right minds either so probably explains why some things were gone and some things stayed behind, they probably rushed your place and was in and out in mere minutes. A junkie will take what they can get,quick cash for meds, weapons and newer looking things in good condition will sale better. They are usually poor and are out of the loop on most electronics since they don't own any of that stuff or never have so they prob by default ignored the electronics. Just all in my opinion.
---
Sucks because I was just getting into the habit of logging in weekly/daily for the challenges, but after the update I haven’t bothered to do any of them. Small thing but def hurting replayability for me :/
---
Oh man don’t even get me started- I used to always do the daily and weekly challenges (or as many as I could) now I don’t even bother, one look at the daily challenges and I know it’s impossible for me so I don’t even try!
---
I just ran west tek and there were two 3* and a 1* super mutant. Did not get any good drops though.
---
Only rare I've seen is on ps4, old man winter. Saw a screenshot posted here showing the person's username and I got in contact with him. Asked to join him, and sure enough, he actually has it. This just goes to show that the drop rate is insanely outrageous. Only 1 rare across all platforms in 3 days
---
I was in the event earlier with my low level and 2 of the bots got taken out by suicide mutants and I got a soldier mask and beret in 1 shot.
---
With the sentinel assassin bloodied build being the new copycat flavor of the month more and more players are out hunting. The first place they go are workshops. Although I do agree if you claim a workshop don’t hang out. That’s easy caps as they can claim and insta kill before you know what happened. If you stay out of the workshop you cut the PVP happy demographic in more than half because they want pvp more than they want the workshop and solo hunters are most likely only ever going to attack if you are In The workshop. My advice, take a workshop only if you are ready to go head to head with another player if that’s not the vibe of your session stay clear of workshops 
---
I saw the sun mask earlier 
---
Careful managing expectations with what you can  display in your camp. I think it might mostly be bobbleheads and weapons/armor to start. 
---
The only conditions are that its a lower level than you and you havent tried to tame it recently and it falls under the list that i gave for its race. other than that its fair game
---
Just one .22 revolver taken, but it was my mother in law's. No credit cards taken. Left the TVs, laptop, tablets, Wii, Xbox 360, 3ds, ds lite, beats, and most of the medication. But yea, definitely feel violated. Still want what they took back. Did help thinking about getting a new gun and what I would do with it if they came back with me home. Was thinking Kentucky long rifle for dramatic effect, and size of hole left. That is a plus of the country. Everyone is armed. 
---
I have sausage duplicates and I can just build you a bonfire if you're on ps4
---
Give me all of your caps or suffer. 
---
76 is how I used to dream of playing fallout. Sure it's not as fluffed up as the single player titles, but for me the ability to make my own stories and content every time I play online with my mates will always beat any single player experience. 
---
I know the guy on ps4 with old man winter. Some guy offered over $100 PayPal for it.
---
Thanks. I'm just paranoid that they might be poisoned now. They are a little shook up which is expected, the house is a mess, but they are fine. I just worry about crazy people being really crazy. And you take care too. Drink a nukashine for me.
---
I was lucky to find a .38 combat rifle that I use regularly whenever I need to clear out that ammo
---
Ironically, I find it's easier to complete not one but all of the weekly challenges in a day then it is to complete even one daily challenge in a day (not including the "level up" challange) 
---
That would be funny though. Be like this game is awful how could you play this, here have it back. Which is what some of the people here think, though a minority.
---
If anything seems wrong make sure you take them to a vet asap :( Hopefully the person wasn't insane enough to hurt them though... That would just be something else... Take care again, best of luck...!!! I'll try!!
---
Oh jeez
---
It ' s almost the same . 
---
Here in Belgium we say .
---
"T 'zijn de schoonste dagen " . 
---
I know the guy with old man winter, he just got very lucky and was surprised when he saw nobody else was really getting it.
---
Thanks, I'll look into it. I don't actually have a steam account, been waiting to actually build a PC and do it right to build up a game library on PC, but I'll definitely check it out.
---
No need to go crazy. Misunderstandings occur. I'd be really miffed if someone told me scorchbeasts didn't attack first outside of that event. 
---
No. You're giving these Devs too much credit. There was a post where someone had mined the event dsta, and it is pure RNG.
---
Building with mods in 4 blows building in 76 away currently. 
---
But overall I actually prefer the world and gameplay to 4. Especially as the map starts getting filled in with locations. There’s a few abandoned train stations that I have a feeling will open up.  
---
The event respawns all the time though. I haven’t nuked Helvetia yet, but i totally would (just to see for certain how it changes things)
---
Yea, basically everything they took can be replaced, minus sentimental value. I hope so too. 
---
And it's alright, they will have to grow up eventually. I hope. For their sake and ours. 
---
If you're on ps4 I will sell it to you for like 50 caps, I have like 3 of them lol 
---
Poo in a hole outside like a real BACKWOODSMAN.
---
I survived 10 days in the wilderness by eating my own fingers.
---
Bethesda lost the technology of layered clothing sometime after developing Morrowind
---
Well as long as you find time to complete missions and campaigns we post and share your Completion reports to gain points towards your promotions then you don’t have to talk in the discord 👍 although we’d like you to say hi every now and again lol if you wish to join I can send you a link
---
Yes, I know the guy 100_Juice_NoPulp he legitimately got the mask. I spoke with him after I saw the reddit post. He qnd I were farming last night with no luck of getting anymore
---
Got a lvl 45 bloodied combat shotty about the only good thing from the event I’ve gotten. 
---
I desperately want hand loaded ammo. DESPERATELY.
---
I HAVE A MIGHTY NEED.
---
I’ve received all the common ones about 5 times each and still not a single owl.
---
Im lvl 19, all I do is get bullied and this aint even survival yet 
---
Anytime someone compares a state of the game to the tse debacle I stop reading 🛑 
---
Hey I’m on if you still are.
---
Go play FO4 !
---
I think selling ammo would be a good change, especially for players in your spot.
---
Buying out vendors is never an issue for us who grind a couple hours a day. It'd just make buying out vendors daily a more attainable goal for casual players.
---
There's truth that it'd make buying out vendors trival... but as I said, it already is for grinders.
---
The floor for buying out vendors either needs to drop or raise, so it's either trivial for everyone or difficult for everyone. I dunno which is better for the game, but I'm on the side of lowering that bar.
---
Grinders are going to grind either way. But it'd make it easier on casual players, so they can spend more time dicking around with their friends.
---
I live near a pumpkin patch and once every few days I make like 30. 
---
Do you have the perks for food and water being more filling?
---
Yea
---
That's like #2 after fixing the door. It was just a fire safe, never anticipated it actually having to defend against someone really trying to get into it. Don't anticipate it being in a fire either, but hey, you never know I guess. I did however expect it to be a bit harder to open though. Looks like they dropped it a few times and its own weight smashed the plastic the metal latch held on to. Cheap piece of crap.
---
In the datamine, the more bots that live the greater your chances to get a mask AT ALL. After that, it's pure RNG. 
---
I would pay an embarrassing amount of monies for a dogfriend.
---
I’ve seen the sun mask.
---
Good luck to you! Catch those scumbags!
---
I would love to nab one of these! ❤️ Will you be on tomorrow/today now, I guess? 😂
---
There is a subpart of one of the weeklies. Finish 10 events while naked, intoxicated, and on drugs. The devs are deviants.
---
Aw man this is sad :C I really want a tamed creature but this is what I'm afraid of! I don't want some enemy or rude player killing them because there's no way to bring them back. They need to make it so it can be "repaired" (via stim or something) , "scrap" (let it die and get the loot from it) OR "release", which sends it away and lets you get a new creature instead... by choice of the owner.
---
Superb owl
---
Thing is, they didn't take anything "good". we don't really have anything "good". The only thing we have of street value is some Ritalin and similar, and that was in the safe, and they left it. Took my wifes lithium though. I'm not sure what else yet, it's all over and mixed up. We have a lot of meds. Still in bottles though. But definitely looking for oxy and such. 
---
You have been drinking too much Nuka Cola. No way. I am level 152 and I play like an hour a week. Sooooo boring. No more excitement in the game. My fav game franchise and such a disappointment 
---
I will try but at the moment I'm taking a break from discord for personal reasons but I would love to join.
---
Had 2 die earlier today. I didn't get a mask at all. Someone else got a toothy.
---
I recently wired my place up with conduits, which looks dumb on the wire mesh floors/ceilings. But now my floor is just half planks half mesh which looks stupid still
---
I was a proud BOS member in fallout 4 and would definatly would like to enlist!
---
I just don't want it to be easier, but that's just my opinion. The game is already easy mode. I'm level 52 and have died 6 times. I just want to feel like I earned my caps. Makes me feel more accomplished. Any game where currency comes easy gets boring fast is all. I like the economy the dev's built. Feels perfect to me.
---
just curious but are you by any chance 12
---
I could hop on really quick add TheMyrenos 
---
I gave up on the challenges since half of them are bugged and didn't register.
---
Already have one but thanks for the offer anyways
---
We didn't have much to take, but they sure as hell took it. And as thorough as they were I think they took their time in a hurried manner. They went into every box. Stuff that was still packed away? Strewn everywhere. And it's not like I'm particularly well off, I work retail part time and got to school the rest. Pretty solidly in the "broke college student" bracket. Which is still higher than tweaker, but still.
---
Alright, and no problem
---
That would be fine if perks were a free choice, but you don't unlock Master Shotgunner until level 45, and the way the game works at the moment, you need as much damage as possible in the mid levels. If you're respeccing an older character, then sure, you take the first level of each card first.
---
76.
---
Hi, I know it's late but does anyone have plans for the outfit that could craft it for me? I don't mind paying however much you want. I'm on Xbox by the way. Thanks :)
---
Sounds good! I’ll dm you a link
---
I tested this out and yes if all bots have full health and you finish the parade you will qualify but the percent chance of getting a rare mask. Two people I was with got one, and the bots had full health, one got a goblin mask and one got the sun mask.
---
We’d be proud to have you! I’ll dm you a link! o7
---
Makes sense. I was all confused until 50. Felt like I was buying a house after each level. 
---
It isn't
---
I wish I had a vacation to take even. Had to call in sick to get a day off to clean. And school stops for nothing, save -30°F windchill. Which was one day. But we don't have any other place to sleep unless we leave the house unattended and without locks. Just the one bed and no air mattress. Not that we would have a place for one with all the mess. But definitely going to just wash everything. 
---
I think I tried that place after seeing it on the Wiki and spent a really long time trying to find it because the farm is gigantic. I eventually left because mask event popped. Do you have a screenshot of the position?
---
Thanks, I'm on PC
---
I really liked both styles of gun play. I liked FO3 because of how limited it was, and the added challenge of not controlling where your bullets could go. You were essentially always hip firing, and depending on the right gun could you truly shoot straight. 
---
NV really got it right in the RPG department by having Strength affect your aim and damage. I tried using a sniper rifle with a low strength character and could never quite get the crosshair on target. 
---
I wish we'd have the Mechanics of NV incorporated into the advancedness of FO4, with an option to choose a more FO3 style of gunplay (like how in DOOM you can choose the "Classic" gun position).
---
Agree
---
I'm gonna Disagree here. I have my camp near Billings be the water and I use the. Corn for part of a massive adhesive farm. With so much corn close I can grow more tato and mutfruit upping how much adhesive I can make.
---
76 is my favorite fallout thus far.
---
If you’re on PS4 and 18+, we have a community of people that do a written and in-game rp storyline about a group of BoS called the Wolfpack and a group of raiders called the Rust Buckets. It was formerly the enclave but the storyline finished and we switched over. I’m a moderator for the server and would be happy to ask about inviting you if you could.
---
Thank you so much. I figured as much but I wasn’t sure. 
---
Lol how romantic! And BS at the same time.
---
Fair enough.
---
I'm hoping this Nuclear Winter business that's coming in the second dlc wave is a harsh survival mode. Like Fallout 4's FROST or HORIZONS mods, if you're familiar. If not, they take vanilla survival mode and makes it really really unfair, basically. They go about it different ways. FROST converts it a survival horror type deal. Notably, it's set more close to the bombs than even 76, and the air above ground is toxic. HORIZONS augments the base game to make the economy/crafting more demanding and the combat more brutal.
---
Yea, thats the plan. They just seem unhappy with the change in scenery though. And the dog was super freaked out. Barked intruder alert barks when I came in. She was in her kennel when it all happened, unable to do anything. Though I'm kinda glad, she could've got hurt even if she did hurt whoever it was. 80lb German Shepard btw. And not fat, extremely large and muscular. Could hurt someone, but I don't know if she even has that in her. Just chases the cats here and there for a few feet so she can get close enough to sniff them. And thanks again.
---
Thanks :)
---
Both times I got the beret it replaced the plan on the loot list.
---
In the elder scrolls online people just have a little pet following them around everywhere lol gonna look funny walk-in around and everybody has dogs 
---
Damn, I should of asked around here first.  I’ve gotten 3 owl a soldier and a witch (just hopped back in after a few months today.).  I just left the owls in bags for others to pick up. 
---
Please tell me there’s no some inflated value to them I didn’t know about haha. (Course is still just give it away anyway *shrugs*)
---
Do you have a link? Cause I'd love to see the code.
---
Intuitively the bloons seem like something that matters. Maybe in conjunction with something else?
---
Two people who I have played in the event with, I've only played the even about 24 times now but one person got the sun mask and another person got the goblin mask. I should mention that when these happened I noticed that all bots had full health, not a scratch so it may be related 
---
That's just too incredible of an idea my friend!
---
Maybe later when we get player vending and this event is gone. I’m saving my spares for now.
---
Down voted for negativity!
---
Nope haven't touched anything at all, thanks for the tip though...heh, tip...https://i.imgur.com/i2yYun3.gif
---
I get the concern but i mean it's supposed to be a side thing mostly it's better than nothing and i'd rather the new stuff be here than not. That's not to say they can't tweak some of the quests overall to bring them in line with what people are expecting to be worth the time. I do however wish they would show you where to get the ingredients when you activate the quests it's kind of annoying having to go to the wiki or whatever to look for where to get blight etc. They did it for the first quest in the chain so there's no reason they couldn't do something similar for the others.
---
I'm on PC and two of the people I played with have gotten a rare mask, sun and goblin
---
Thanks, sounds like I won't regret investing into the cards!
---
If anyone has the plans I'd be willing to pay for someone to craft it for me. Thanks. I'm on Xbox by the way :)
---
The person who datamined has no idea if his sample is a good indicator of actual programmed drop rates. I wouldn't put much stock in it. 
---
I like the event, although i wasn't expecting much to be honest. I'm just glad they can start adding content now that they have a lot of the stuff ironed out, just hope for the asset loading if that's what it is that causes the sudden fps dips and random hitches digital foundry seems to think it's tied to their asset loading in the engine. Besides that i'm just patiently waiting to see how the game turns out now they have content coming in which is what i bought this game for (an ever growing game in the fallout universe with friends or others.
---
Another thing to note, not every patch in wow, destiny, eso or whatever the game may be is going to have content that pleases everyone sometimes devs try and make something that will try and fit in with the whole playerbase right off the bat instead of them having to dump hours and hours into it to access the new content, which is what it seems they have done here. Let's what and see what the rest of the content coming in the future is like before we get the pitchforks games had it rough enough (rightfully so in most cases) as is.
---
Not bad, I'm honesty just hoping to get the Jester. Literally the only one I want.
---
I've wondered about the balloons. 
---
Have a specific build in mind, (sniper, commando, melee, splosive, etc) and put points to that first. Pick damage increasing cards first, then go for crafting once you're a higher level. I did the opposite and it just makes life harder and grindy-er.
---
He's a troll.
---
I'm started work8ng on a character with 15 luck, got him to 9 before I has to go out. Will start checking again in about 6 hours.
---
It's personal now, that cargo bot must die.
---
It would need to give about half of the resources needed to craft them under full Ammosmith perk. Otherwise it opens a can of worms in resource hunting.
---
So if you need 12 Gunpowder, 10 Lead and 40 Steel to craft 180 pcs .50 cal ammo (ammosmith perk +80% boost)
---
Then breaking down 200 pcs .50 cal ammo would give you 6 gunpowder, 5 lead and 20 steel
---
That way the breaking down of ammo would not affect too much the resource hunting in the game, but would allow us to an option to convert unused ammo to resources.

When my son was younger (still a toddler) and i used to raid in wow i bought a set of earbud heaphones with a mic that worked with my pc so i could have one bud out of my ear so i could still hear everything i needed to , maybe that's something you could look into. It was very cheap as well i think i got skullcandy ones for like 15 bucks and they actually rocked, i used them for music on my phone too.
---
I can guranntee i wasnt here for this since the time i nuked it we won we only did it for testing to see if we could get rare masks
---
How did you tame a sloth???
---
Same thing happened to me with the initial Nukashine quests, the nuked the frat house. Had to fight my way through 15-20 bloated radiated mutants, alone..it was a nightmare.
---
You're missing out bud. 
---
All of the maskes are stupid looking. Just like most of the costumes, poses and pretty much everything from the Atomic Shop. Who cares!
---
"Big spiked helmets" = Pikelhauße 
---
One thing I noticed both of those times is that the robots took zero damage and so I think it may be what marks you eligible for a rare mask, I know the when guy who got the goblin mask I got the soldier mask which Is probably the most rare of the masks, I  have 3 soldier, 6 witch, 4 giant, 5 toothy and 4 owl, once i got nothing at all not even plans.
---
You can pick it up for roughly 3k ar harpers ferry. You'll need gun nut rank 3 to craft them. It's still super expensive but it's at least viable. 
---
I don't know if super duper will work because I think this is a bug (like I said, I'm pretty sure we should be getting 100 fuel just from trying to craft fuel and there is just some weird mismatch happening here) but it's worth a try. 
---
Let me know if super duper helps. 
---
I had this happen yesterday too. Very very annoying. It's not just the fact it can make the event unplayable if you get the butchers task, the event is open to everybody. From the highest level possible to a player fresh out the vault. Nuking it stops the really low levels participating. Just not fair.
---
And it's not just one event that is affected. The next 2 or 3 are as well as the nuke zone remains for a couple hours. Again, no big deal if you have the protection for it, but very annoying.
---
Ok. I can server hop. But I shouldn't have to.
---
Haven't played the game in a while, but I would love to mount a scorchbeast head on my wall.
---
By the way, last time I played was a bit before the TSE Nerf a while back. Got to level 50, but never really did much in the main story. My biggest issues with the game were the bullet sponge enemies like super mutants, and the fact that game ran just unwell enough on my PC to bother me. Is it worth coming back to at this point?
---
I want Fallout 76 to have automation like in Fallout 4. I really want to be able to do more than just extractors.
---
Do you have a donut recipe?
---
I like it coz they won't catch me. You get rewards for being alive the longest... earn the reward.
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll see if I can apply that into my runs
---
Hey, I’d be interested in joining up. I’m 25 and a PC player, with a level 85 character. As a bonus, I also already have a BoS chest piece for my character!
---
You can’t kill the horde!
---
FO4 engine gonna do FO4 engine things
---
Vintage lead champagne, is not findable in the game to my knowledge, I am also looking for it. 
---
Did you get some?
---
I'm use to dying... I have an explosive shotgun and no ranks in fireproof :|
---
Yeah it can be kinda annoying when you're running low on bullets and such. Makes the "survival" a bit grindy, for sure. 
---
Oh, you're right. Regardless, the point stands: modders have shown that it's possible in the engine, with some creative workarounds. :)
---
I do not but I have a friend with a duplicate 
---
Yes, I have an a Outcast Raider, a Nuka-Cola obsessed fan girl and a Chinese infiltrator who was a spy during the war,
---
No unfortunately. I keep getting alcohol recipes that require other alcohol recipes so I can’t make any of them :(
---
I feel your pain. I had a tamed deathclaw for the longest time, but one day my CAMP got attacked by a Scorchbeast. During the attack, he was scorched and became hostile towards the CAMP objects, but he still never attacked me.
---
I chose to euthanize him after a few days, as the poor thing did nothing but attempt to murder the crops 24/7.
---
But...they were in the exact same place they were a few minute prior (on balconies/inside buildings)!   Not sure why all enemies respawn every few minutes, especially in the area of the map that everyone starts out at (Sutton, the airport, etc)...:(
---
Survival mode in general sounds bad.
---
Op wants to roadmap\* how long it will take to level up. Supplied data is over 4 months old.
---
Right on! I’ll dm you a link!
---
Yeah me to weird right? 
---
Hey buddy, I too am too broke to upgrade my FM2+ Motherboard. 
---
I run an Nvidia Geforce 1050 Ti GPU, AMD Athlon x8 quad core xxxx, 24gb DDR3 RAM. Those are the big three components when it comes to gaming. I also use a Gigabyte motherboard. 
---
Now dont misunderstand me, I can usually play 76 with my textures cranked up, lighting and water on high, but shadow quality and distance on low. Runs smooth but some issues when lots of other players are around. 
---
Fallout4 looks great on my rig with no mods and the settings cranked all the way up. Runs smooth too. 
---
If I were you, I would keep saving until you can upgrade to a Ryzen MB and new DDR4 ram. It will last much, much longer than any short term upgrade you make now. 
---
Just wanted to throw my 2 cents in since I find myself in a similar situation. 
---
Great character, but his missions are bugged to hell.
---
I was able to start it at 25 mins and complete the whole parade alone. I haven't seen a nuked event yet. I have seen people with op weapons killing everything before newbies can hit them, Its been mostly ok and fun. Of course, I haven't done it 42 times. As a very experienced MMO player. I have to have something to enjoy about the event next year. I don't need to get all the rare ones in one season. 
---
The majority of the fixture and fittings, character designs and graphical interface have migrated from the original Fallout 4 Engine. So it's logical that the programmers and designers should have the capacity to transfer the designs from the Institute facility for clean, sanitary equipment and furniture. Although like Star Trek I don't remember finding a toilet or lavatory. (No wonder the Institute failed in the end ;) )     
---
Having a completed a C.A.M.P. design based on a hospital would have wanted clean walls, furniture and sanitary conditions. In another thread I requested Clean Nurses Uniforms, toilets, beds and a bath. Understandably it's 25 years on, but as others have said there is plenty of paint, solvent, acid and tools to fix up and clean a premises.    
---
They don't come back on server swap any more?
---
Just looking at the map it's almost always fully populated for me, time zones and region may be an issue.
---
What is next quest objective?
---
something is not rare if everyone has it.... 
---
It’s on the list of things we want. 
---
Same here, you aren’t alone!
---
I thought of the idea of playing a raider but trying to team up with other raiders so we can kill and loot everyone else. But as some holotape I found near Spruce Knob alludes, we'd probably just end up killing each other. Sucks we wont get that faction warfare update until probably Fall. So we'd have to do it ourselves. 
---
You mean you don’t want to listen to the radio while drinking moonshine 76 times?
---
I have seen the sun mask on a player. I have done the event over 50 times. No rares for me though.
---
Generally, because people are assholes is why.
---
Well, you're not wrong! LOL
---
I got a beret :)
---
i think xbox has more players then PS4 cause of the massively discounted bundles 
---
but it will be only lvl 35 ...
---
New character then transfer it via friend to other character.
---
Still sounds BS. 
---
They're just repeating what they've heard.
---
My friend played the game with me in the beta and even though her initial thought was that she liked it, her boyfriend started regurgitating all the crap everyone was saying so she never bought it.
---
I'm thinking I'm just getting unlucky and there's a timer on the event that doesn't show up
---
can confirm jumping over the fence from the fog condenser unit by the courtyard where the terminal is. boost agility w chems/food/etc if need be.
---
The music in the tattoo parlor BUMPS!!
---
Your welcome. There are 5 different Cappy outfits, they all have a chance at spawning at the TNT dome where you get the T51b nuka cola paint. There are two Outfit spawns in there and can spawn the Cappy Jacket &amp; Jeans out of the 5 different Cappy outfits. You just have to server hop that dome and you will get it. Make sure you don't pick up any Outfits except for the one you want or it will take 24 hours for the Outfits to respawn. 
---
I have about 12 of them. You can have one.
---
Goddd why are people like that? I'm sorry about your friend's bf. He sounds like a tool.
---
People are so weird with their mob mentalities... either play the game or don't. It shouldn't matter than much!
---
I've thought about this a bit before and I realized 2 things: 1. it would be cool to have a quest where you get a dog as a companion. 2. If other people could do this same quest and also get the dog as a companion then it would be strange to see another player that has a dog that's like a clone of yours
---
That's a good idea :o
---
I mean Bethesda said they wanted to see what happens if they put nukes in the hands of players.
---
Turns out it being a Fallout game or Survival light doesn't stop the trolling.
---
Sounds great!
---
Do you have a build link at all? Or comment on this one i quickly threw together? (Swap out perks for 1h, 2h, etc as required) 
---

---
Either way, ill hold him for 15. Gotta make an old fashion anyways lol
---
If you don't have the certificate in your inventory it will send you to do it again. Mine was in my stash, so I didn't do it again. 
---
Ok, just went and had a look. With Hard Bargin perk level 3, the plans for the calibrated shocks is 6000 caps. From the vendor bot named Greg in Grafton. Not the one at the station, but northeast of the station. Watch out for the usual supermutants, scorched, and maybe the Grafton monster. Also try Camden park's bot Chad, same plans, same cost. 
---
Oh, and as a side note, the mods for excavator armor don't actually show up as being for excavator armor, they just come with the description, say Reactive Plates (50% dmg reflected back) if the item stats show up as being black Titanium then the mod is for excavator armor.
---
Xbox? If so I’ll help you out
---
Xbox. Sorry forgot to put that
---
Imagine if you had a screen for your dog with some breed/color/markings/size/collar options. That would be neat, and if there were more options in the atom shop you could even design a mutt.
---
At least there would be some variety!

Question: is there anywhere else to find alcohol recipes than Biv once a day?? 
---
The last recipe he gave me was the Tick Blood Tequila Margarita which requires Tick Blood Tequila (that I can’t make because I don’t have the recipe).... also I keep getting duplicates so I’ve only got two recipes and I can’t even make them :( 
---
Sorry about that. Just changed it
---
27. U want sum fuk
---
Sure, it just so happens that not a single person on the internet has gotten one yet. Yeah, *that's* believeable. 
---
Joining GT jv5tyn1
---
Totally agree, but a lot of other problems needs to be fixed as well, like the VATS not working properly, the wrong damage calculations, the adrenalin exploit, the free and easy to use cheats and list goes on.
---
Survival is gonna be a total mess as it stands, and it looks like Bethesda will need a massive backlash again to understand it, and it is sad.
---
For me I always pick up ballistic ammo. I am mainly shotguns. But I managed to save up 2k .45 rounds that I traded somebody for 1200 shells. Was a great deal for me personally. Also had a ton of 10mm I never used and found a quad explosive 10mm pistol I have been having a blast with since the ammo is expendable for me. I never pick up other stuff though like fuel, harpoons, syringer rounds, etc. Would be nice to break them down to half the crafting mats though. I would def be for that
---
Because they're dumb. 
---
Mainly I don't like that we have to pay because I always feel guilty about camping in the boonies. I had a really awesome spot in the middle of nowhere, but every time I had to pay 20 caps to get anywhere I'd be like "ugh dammit self that's 20 caps!", and so I moved. Like where I'm at, but would rather be at my old spot. :p
---
I absolutely agree
---
Hit it with bloody mess til it turns into goop and then you can loot it. Worked for me. 
---
And like a post at your camp where you can leash your dog to
---
I don't know man. I'm still a big fan of things like actual quests, npcs, a storyline, choices, and relationships in video games. 
---
I'll be on all day tomorrow if you wanna hit me with your secret sausage recipe. Many pleases and thank yous if you you do hold one for me. PSN: dutchrudders151
---
Half of which are bugged and don't drop. 
---
Sounds good, I should be on in about 2 or 3 hours 
---
Yay! Another faction of dead people that I can "join"! 
---
I have the perk, and just checked the map. From the Crosshair, to Forward Station Delta (just about the 2 furthest points) is 54 caps. 
---
Sure, it's not a lot, but not's not nothing, either. If you've got a base up North, getting to Watoga is expensive. And vise versa. 
---
Having a route isn't the point. 
---
Yeah, I get shit on by people who play fortnite for fucks sake. C'mon
---
Wait aren't there only five bots for the parade In total? I've been avoiding the event for the most part, only done it a few times. 
---
Yeah when there isn't a timer on an event I don't even bother. 
---
...and, fast-traveling to events is a great way to unlock parts of the map without having to literally hike to every spot (if you don’t want to do it all the old fashioned way).  You can travel to an event, then use it as a hub to explore surrounding areas until another good event pops up
---
Whenever it does that, whether it's been nuked or not, I just sit and wait for it to meat pile. 
---
To Bethesda support pages dude.
---
Herd mentality IRL man. Gotta look cool even if you have no idea what you're talking about. 
---
Whenever they resolve inventory concerns. If you believe you were wrongly banned submit a ticket to try and work things out.  Try logging in every now and again to see if you were cleared, I couldn't log in on march 1st but didn't get an email so just hopped on anthem. Logged in last week and all is back to normal, overweight mules and everything. 
---
Lv355? 700hrs
---
You may bee the gunsmith perk active and the right level to add the mod. 
---
I wholeheartedly agree. You can also create random floating walls by placing a foundation, snapping a doorway or two, removing said foundation, and then changing the doorways to whatever wall you want. I use that a lot to build reasonable things that the game won't otherwise allow. Works great for crop protection, too, though I prefer realistic structures.
---
And don't even get me started on the ridiculous fact that the 'plain' stairs can only be placed in the center of a floor (what a waste of space, and how many times have I fallen through the resulting hole upstairs?!) and that those wonderful big staircases can't be stacked on top of one another (which they absolutely should be able to do, and it would be sublime). If they'd even just fix those two things, I'd be one happy C.A.M.P.er.
---
Oh, and maybe half-floor versions of our Atomic Shop flooring.
---
Awsome! How the f... Did u get it up there!? :) :) I love how there's a bunch of people in the zeppelin, just casualy doing stuff. 
---
i hope we have a dog vendor that sells different dog "breeds" these are effectivly skins for your dog also want your dog to be able to level up  and get some bonuses and teach them "tricks" upon a level up your dog could have special stats that affect different things 
---
strength affects bite damage/carry weight 
---
perception can effect how often it "finds" (randomly obtains)  items you are tracking.
---
charisma could affect how fearsome your dog is (imagine wasteland whisperer but the creature runs away)
---
endurance could effect how long its able to hold onto an enemy for you to shoot them as well as reduce how often your should need to feed them.
---
intelligence could be how many different contexual interactions occur EX press e to give command and look at a wrench and press e to tell them to fetch it.   
---
unsure of luck though
---
I currently have gunsmith rank 5 and rank 2 of all the science perks. Should be good on perks to put any mod on an energy gun with that. The mod hasn't even showed up on the list at all
---
Just curious, any unique rewards for the event that you can remember? 
---
Fast Traveling back to Helvetia will often correct him. 
---
I almost lost my own Sloth (Named Mr Swiggler), to a Scorch Beast. I loaded in, heard the retard shriek, logged off. Logged in a few minutes later, only got some damage on a turret - A+ for fast logouts lol
---
I always figured the build system was designed to allow enemies correctly path to attack camps.
---
No problem. I'm a programmer myself and having hard time imagining how the game could fail loading assets/resources. Internal limits on object counts, memory constraints?
---
Take it out of stash and drop it. Pick it back up and see if it behaves 
---
They would have done it if was a band shirt. People just like to crap on folks’ day.
---
I would love this.
---
That's been there since launch, doesn't seem to be connected to the event 
---
I too want this.  But I wonder if the servers can handle another stash per player?  I am genuinely wondering because I have no background in this regard.
---
Same 'types' of vendor bots will share the same cap inventory. All Whitespring bots, all Responder bots, all Raider bots. Then you have the Enclave, BoS, Watoga and Harper's Ferry as unique ones, as well as Graham if you bump into him (although I experienced Graham and Watoga sharing inventories, but it might have been a bug).
---
Altogether you can get a guaranteed 1400 caps from them daily.
---
Yup log in sees rads climbing... Nope out to a new server.
---
OP: so sorry to hear this. Everyone: I'm poor as fuck these days but I'll get the ball rolling on a fund to get this  guy another console. $10 from me if we can do this?
---
I think I got some plans but I already knew them so tossed them on an alt. I don't recall what they were, sorry. 
---
Here it is:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKTCf\_nDHKc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKTCf_nDHKc)  But they fixed this glich 😃
---
In my experience they're either on the dressers or benches downstairs, or the bed, table, or dresser upstairs 
---
To be fair: Save the World is pretty fun. Although has the exact same issue as fo76. No endgame content.
---
Hello, still nothing
---
Try searching for ams corporate, I think I've seen other people talking about an unsolved mystery quest related to it as well
---
I meet cram yesterday and he had plans for the valt bed and unstoppable's posters and bought them as I've not seen these outside of the shop,got back to camp and I can't craft them probably another bug but it cost me caps.
---
He's my best friend in all of Appyda- Appy- Appstay- Appalachia, because he could really use a hand and I got more than just the one. Plus he's got plenty more recipes to try ooout... 
---
I want to mount the stump of a Grafton Monster.
---
I don’t drink diet soda anyway but go ahead and tempt fate and hurt yourself with cancer sticks it’s not my problem just don’t try bullshitting others with the outright lie they don’t cause cancer... that makes you as bad as any murderer.
---
I you want to see other players go to whitesprings 
---
The stump of a Grafton Monster.
---
I love when people utilize the empty space under those armor workbenches.  
---
I had enough of people asking "where's the stash?" because they don't even acknowledge the box under the bench. I keep a "components" sign on it, now. Makes it more obvious.
---
I hope not people always seem to pop them.
---
We can rebuild
---
you can see this mentality everywhere its rather depressing its in politics ,gaming ,and anything else you can name
---
ill be interested in this
---
Afaik, the proc chance is per-hit. So if it works like most other effects usually do in 4 and 76,  it will have an individual proc chance per pellet with a shotgun. It also goes off much more frequently on high ROF weapons; minigun/laser gat, which tends to support the per-hit proc. 
---
Raider Radio from NW, but with Rose instead of Redeye
---
I’m guessing it’s gonna use your stashes inventory just like the fermenter 
---
I've been beating up on Just cause 4... I cant wait to come back to FO76 and see the updates.
---
I never seem to get intoxicated, just addicted to alcohol its so annoying while im trying to do these dailys and i cant even get drunk
---
I highly recommend!
---
Same, I take a Technical Data shit every time I login.
---
I would have, which would have seen me and a number of other friends return to the game but we are passing completely.  Not interested in existing character transfers thanks.
---
Except diet soda doesn’t have literally EVERY chemical described as DO NOT ingest like rat poison or poisons that exist as a Ctrl-alt-delete on living carbon based life forms... like cyanide and arsenic.
---
Random Theory time! Is iguana on a stick actually iguana meat though ? Consider, we've -still- never seen an iguana in fallout, and we know they sell human meat as 'Iguana bits'. Iguana bob and his fellow 'Iguana' meat vendors could just be very skilled at carving meat into the shape of Iguanas. \^\^
---
Well in defense to people bashing on Fallout 76... they DID screw us over at the beginning. 
---
If you are on xbox, hit me up I have the key, I'll open for you.
---
I think the big boned one is clapping...
---
i would rework the system to have skills and level cards skills give you a passive perk card that cant be changed canidates for these are the weight cards crafting cards and  the previously skills type cards  like lockpicking or hacking 
---
A lot of he map is highly underutilized. These places have a ton of potential for DLC without adding more map. A few places I can rattle off is Crashed Space station (currently a door that won’t open so maybe future hints), ATLAS observatory, Whitesprings (hand scanner doors), Nuka Cola factory, Lucky Hole mine (large dead ‘deep one’), Point Pleasant (Mothman cult), all of the ash heap region, and the 3 unopened Vaults (not including the newly added unmarked Pink labeled vault door). Let’s hope they get to these first.
---
It's probably so that other new players will still have stuff to kill even if someone else went through there 5 minutes ago. Unfortunately it can be a real pain for camping. I'm outside Helvetia right now and the Scorched next to my house are constantly respawning. The sound of their slow, constant, poorly-aimed hip shots is more torturous to me than a dripping faucet.
---
Get a level of Home Defense whenever you're able and pop up 6 or 8 heavy machine gun turrets. You'll come home to corpses and meat piles every time instead.
---
T-51bender...... I agree with you about FO3 and FONV, they are my favs also. 
---
Can I help out/donate some how?
---
I just followed this and found the xo1 quantum paint.
---
Only when at my camp. I don a pink nurse uniform, make people sit in my exam chair (chair with the curved floor lamp over it) and sell them drugs. Lots of drugs. All the drugs.
---
I had him earlier, tried to hold him for people and he just died on me. Nothing even attacked him. :(
---
What I miss from Fallout 4 and what we will never see in FO76 before a very long time, if ever (and why FO4 is vastly superior to FO76 in my mind):
---
\- We have no persistent impact on the world (no quest line which can modify the background story, no faction you can follow or betray, etc...)
---
\- No mods : this is the absolute reason I put 1000+ hours in FO4, it allowed you to add content, expand features of the game, counteract some of its limitations and frustrations
---
Yeah but this event is limited, imagine its the last day and its close to few minutes before the servers close for maintenance to remove the event and someone nukes it basically ruining your last chance at the event, feel like events need safeguards. Bethesda already makes the chief robot immune to death, prevents players pvping inside the event, and killing the robots; they just didn't think about the nukes.
---
Any evidence of that, or just the usual wet blanket?
---
(The wet blanket comment is sarcasm intended for humor. Welcome to Reddit)
---
I have a friend who can be like this with games. I remember when I had bought Dragon Age 2 and he was all smug and said he wouldn't buy it because people online had complained about the changes to the combat system, then when Dragon Age Inquisition came out the first thing he said about it was that he liked the new combat system. It's the same one as in Dragon Age 2, you dumb fuck!
---
I definitely preferred Origins combat though, reminded me of KotOR which I loved, but Dragon Age 2 was still a great game.
---
Anyways, my point is, some people just trust whatever opinion is the loudest.
---
&gt; *A player is attempting to claim your workshop at [x].*  
---
&gt; *Challenge?*  
---
&gt; *Yes*/*No*
---
Tis where I found mine too. Can't get it to spawn again :(
---
What platform??
---
My build with only 262 phys resist stops more damage than over 100k resist. 60% from sentinel, 20% lone wanderer, 20% dodgy =95% dmg reduction with 30+ AP)
---
It wont stop a well built bloodied build from ending me in one punch. survival is 100% on whether you win the "serendipity" coin flip.
---
There are bloodied builds that can wheel out 10k+ dmg. I can survive ~8k dmg hits, just barely.
---
Is the witch mask rare?
---
Yeah, but I still think its insane they made 5 mask so rare that I feel people that have it are the dev room cheaters. Makes me think of those times were I don't get a mask/beret and only get a plan even though all robots survived if that meant I was suppose to get one of those 5 rare masks or just got super shafted.
---
20 events AND quests😐
---
Hyperbole on my behalf, as you seem to be aware, but none the less, I'm of a mind that if you're going to bring your main over to survival mode, you should face actual risk. A few stimpacks are small enough a loss and a small enough gain for another, but your mountain of caps...
---
See when I first started playing this game and found out about the wendigos all I wanted to do was have a wendigo head mounted on my wall. So I really want this to be a thing.
---
I played at the day of launch and kept up for about 5 days, and then work and everything else caught up and I really got too busy to play again until last week. I think it is improved phenomenally. I told everybody that it had a good system in place and that if they Iron Out The Kinks it will be one of the best games, but until they do it's going to be bumpy. I'm willing to put up with that because I'm not had any catastrophic failures yet. 
---
Yep. I take screencaps of the ones I like the most though so that I can keep them.
---
Try combining it with acrobat legendary gear. At certain heights like that really tall bridge highway near flatwoods seems to ignore those perks a bit, without them or power armor you die though lol.
---
Yes they do. When you complete one (i.e. mod 76 chest armor) then it’ll give you a new one.
---
I think those quest are busted, those quest give you a note at a random chance spawn location, those are scattered around the maps like it spawns lemonade stands, the note for a the misc quest, deathclaws, ghouls, etc. Anyway the note said to go to mining spot in watoga and I checked the whole place for the item never found it. Usually the note says what item its looking for. Its either really hard quest that doesn't hold your hand once your inside the building or broken.
---
Sometimes if something is green but it won't let you place it, try moving your character further away or standing at a different angle and often it will let you, even if it's previously said it's restricted. This has worked for me when I've almost given up, many times. Dunno why, maybe it's a character hit box thing or something :-s 
---
They fixed the glitch, but if you don't move your camp or delete items, doesn't your glitched stuff still work?
---
Yup! Just so i can run around butt naked fresh out of the vault with nothing but a 1* assassins pipe. " im a low level toon, i just wanna trade, i wont pipe you promise!" 
---
As long as the effects of the alcohol are in place, you are classed as intoxicated.
---
It normally wants you to grab a piece of armor from the location in a specific container.  You get the quest often doing server hops for the civil war stuff.
---
Or sloth claw 
---
Excellent. I was wondering why I got that one long after I'd thought I'd gotten it before. Thanks for the info.
---
Eh its same for anything hated by the general public look at people wearing maga hats. The game isn't perfect or high rating, but I don't think it deserved the score it got, even no man's sky that had so many failed promises had a better score at launch lol. Too much bandwagon to hate and most never even tried it. 
---
Its just as bad as the perk ingame when your solo lol.
---
I think you should stay with the community so you can find out what's shaking until you can get yourself back to Appalachia
---
Yes it's actually a pretty stingy range around your character. As a photographer a lot of the joy I get from this game is with the camera.
---
No problem, I’ve grinded out a ton of these challenges for atoms so I noticed fairly early on that they update :) 
---
Yeah people are so quick to hate games and not give it a chance, look at r6 siege and no man's sky they started out bad over time got more updates and are way better state then they began. Thing is people don't notice that Bethesda doesn't do big multiplayer games and to make that work in their single player sandbox game with a huger map is a pretty big accomplishment, if it wasn't so buggy I would say launch was pretty smooth.
---
I have one of those! They shoot through schools.
---
X box
---
Its worst then that, we finished the parade setups and the parade was starting and someone nuked it. Everyone fled and after the nuke landed the event was over, I'm assuming if all robots die the event automatically fails and even though the robots are immune to player's attacks; guess they aren't to the nuke.
---
4 gets my vote any day. 76 moves a step or two forward in some areas but it leaves a whole bunch of gaping holes in the general fallout formula (even 4 had a few of those) I happily put 1000+ hours in 4, I'll be lucky to crack 100 in 76.
---
Nice, every time I get one I get excited. 
---
seeing as with one perk you can craft almost 300 at a time... this should take you 30 minute to gain. 
---
This but we'll have to stick with it because the first two weeks are going to be wild
---
Nuking that zone feels so useless, I was able to get some nuka flora to make stable flux, but there is like no mobs in the town; it just a jerk being a tool.
---
Its easier to do the other options like naked and on drugs at event, etc.
---
Well done!  My camp is near there, up the hill on the left from where this pic was taken.
---
Always beeline for abandoned power armor. They usually have a core in them. 
---
The cores are weak, but they might at least tie you over.  
---
It would be really great if we could infuse cores up to 100. 
---
;)
---
I was able to do the event either before the recent patch or after. Most recent I could have completed it but ran out of time because I joined late. Its possible a player stole all the optional fertilizers for you?
---
Being dumb but is an ultracite weapon different from a scorched killer weapon?
---
Weird thing is I had 2 times were all bots lived and both times I only received 1 plan no mask or beret. While 2 times were I had 2 bots die I got masks. Feel like this event is as bad as the rng in legendaries that forced people to dupe.
---
You can also get intestines from opposums and there's always a couple in Flatwoods
---
Doubt that will help unless the event bases it off based luck. Because I have base luck 10 and unyielding boosts it past 20 and I have yet to get any of the 5 rare masks.
---
I think I saw the goblin mask but I thought it was rare not impossible. Still feel like out of all the players less then 50 are going have the masks really sad.
---
Thank you! 
---
It just works
---
Survival mode is going to be a dumpster fire on launch even if they solve this issue.
---
Weird thing is you can get more caps selling silver ore then a silver fork. Also, in the future Bethesda said they want us to be able to display junk items at our camps; so rare junk items like figurines, full giddyup buttercup, and other rare junk you might not want to scrap.
---
I had my first today, so much fun! 
---
I don't know if this is on purpose or not but last patch made hunger and thirst drop way faster then normal. Also I think reason water goes down faster then hunger is because everyone is sprinting ingame and that probably lowers the thirst faster especially with speed demon mutation.
---
It's good to hear that you, your other half and your pets are okay.
---
So no life players can get even more op? 
---
For me, twice, I had one robot die and got no mask in both cases. I don't think letting the robots die is a good idea.
---
I seen a post about that were someone fast travel disconnect and lost an item. Its gone and Bethesda can't do anything to help you recover that item, which is sad because they technically could have an employee with mod privileges join a player and spawn an item to drop for the player; but I guess that is too much work for them.
---
Lost my plants, cow, and turret when I moved my camp.
---
I think this is the first time it's happened to me. I'd take the camp dupe bug over this one any day.
---
 
---
But I can just hit up the farm by Biv and get my plants back, at least.
---
Yeah, it's alternate type of laser gun. I am pretty sure ultracite weapons still do extra damage to scorched though.
---
Wish they thought as a player and not a dev, how is this fun having the items droprate so low on a week long event.
---
Wish we could hotkey perk cards.
---
I just gave that a try and the mod still isn't showing up in the list of stock/grip mods I can build.
---
Feel like most people roleplay as raiders lol.
---
This YouTube video might help.
---
https://youtu.be/gE5pKPQh7Jo
---
I wish the sloth was 3 star and max lvl lol.
---
For some unknown reason the game started to work...nothing changed...thanks for your time guys! 😉
---
I’m with you. The only reason I would have been banned the first time was I stole a shotgun from someone who was dropping it to switch accounts- maybe the shotgun was duped? 
---
Now i’m rebanned but I only played for about an hour to look around my camp. No reason I should be banned, much less twice. Hopefully a mistake. As a loyal, noncheating player, this sucks.
---
I love my conduit, despite it being a hassle to setup at times....I think though that when placing  ceiling lights/boxes, they should sit below the floor above, not clip into it.  Would jsut make building with it a bit easier, vs having to align  the wall piece straight.
---
If your serious /r/guns will help you pick a gun and give you some tips on how to use it 
---
Amazing
---
I built a tool for tracking them. Not as useful as an in game timer, but it still works pretty well.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hgL2TUetOLtVIpsEH8HSKXbZtavKZqs-xgWBXQLLdg4/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Agreed, that look so much nicer too.
---
Or since it’s Fallout and a nuclear apocalypse maybe  we stop getting brand new shiny shit that destroys the theme of the game?
---
If you want brand new appliances go play The Sims. 
---
Pacifist mode does not prevent incoming damage.
---
It stops you from damaging them.
---
Phoenix Bot in Watoga (In the Super Duper mart) often has a few camp plans, I picked up 2 different TVs from him today as well as some end tables. Also check  Wallace Bot in Harper's Ferry. Claiming workshops and doing Defend events also reward camp plans.
---
Right YouTuber wrong link lol
---
https://youtu.be/kgjKgpNzcAI
---
The 'usually' is a an understatement- its *always*. Even animal maneur is treated and composted to be safe for farm use.  Everything that touches food pretty much has to be clean, otherwise you get the e.coli romaine lettuce that was caused by contaminated irrigation water. 
---
In the past it was limited by recipes like make pyscho etc. But those were rare not everyday like after this patch. Also, beginning of the patch we had lvl 3 times while drunk for 3 days or more straight. Its annoying when you forget to drink when you level up and just wasted a level.
---
Thank you for your reply. I have a single GPU for gaming, that being my GTX 1070Ti and a single GPU I use to offload my streaming performance on being an AMD RX 480.
---
Disabling the second GPU that I use for streaming seems to resolve the issue, I will answer the rest of the questions anyway.
---
I read somewhere that Fallout has a bug where it tries to offload some of the GPU usage to the second GPU so maybe this is related to that?
---
I think I may have to resort to setting up my ini files to recognize what GPU it should be using if I want a full fix but this will work for now.
---
I have three monitors. My main monitor is hooked up via display port while my two outer monitors are running using an active DP to HDMI.
---
All my montiors are set to 100% as I do not like using the scaling features inside Windows.
---
I would like an event that scales based on pmayers who have entered. Maybe we have to bring a variety of food and drink items.
---
Like a post apocalyptic pot luck. For each different item donated by players it could change the loot table?
---
Have you gotten the "Give up on Fallout 76" challange? I've been crushing it daily for nearly 2 months now. 
---
Lol I'm a high level player and other players oneshotted it before I could even get a shot, first time I seen it melted. Yeah, reminds me of when tse was king were people would one shot all the legendaries so others couldn't get a hit.
---
Doesn't the event usually take like 15-20 min as well? So it seems like server hopping might have about a 25% chance that the event is going on or about to start. I've had decent luck with server hopping. 
---
I wish he would sell rare beers and I wish Bethesda gave all named robots choosable dialogue like in FO4, give us the illusion of choice and story lol.
---
I had a sloth when there was the camp animals glitch, now its been replaced with a gift radstag named Bucky
---
I agree! I just ended up finding a war drum on the sloth at Fasnacht and thought it would be cool to give it a go. 
---
This is the reason I never use PA. Sad I miss part of the game just coz of screen asthetics. But it really bothers me that much. If you see a lvl 100+ in a hazmat suit at SBQ, please give me a wave X
---
Remember to factor in super duper as well
---
Initially I liked fo76 more than 4, but not more than 3 or New Vegas. 4 just had way too many NPCs... Way too much happening for a post apocalyptic world for my tastes. And not much point to any of them. The only area I really liked was the yellow sea. Fo76 lack of NPCs was a little bit jarring and you get a bit sick of the "they are dead" narrative. But still fun.
---
Don't worry Bethesda, it's fine the way it is and if masks were meant to be extremely rare it's fine. No one is "entitled" to anything
---
I lost my level 14 Snallygaster I've had for 2 weeks...server was having major issues not loading my inventory or half my PA..  went to my camp and he was lying stuck somewhere with his tongue out and eyes watching me... but dead...
---
Haven't ever seen anorher one in those two weeks...
---
I gotta come visit sometime looks brilliant 
---
After some research I found that there is no plan for it. You can put it on your weapon if you have the mod for it. The only way to craft it is by scraping the mod itself not the weapon. It is not a guaranteed unlock so you might have to scrap a few mods to unlock it.
---
They feel like they're part of something by hating on whatever is trendy to dislike.
---
I really like what you did with the weapons workbench area! I should post my camp one of these days
---
They just need to make it impossible to claim bounty by someone with whose account you were in party or friends in the last x days/hours. Then they won't be able to exploit wanted system. It also shouldn't be possible to initiate combat if you don't have enough caps to pay for your death (this should be satisfied for whole team before any member can initiate).
---
Yes 
---
option 1: armor pieces with weapon weight reduction, 5 pieces = 90% reduction; am rolling with this setup as a hoarder
---
option 2: sell / giveaway
---
option 3: put them in random stashes across the map and log off. may some lucky souls find them :)
---
Lmfao 
---
haven't managed to get a shot on the sloth yet :( But I'm happy with my masks and decorations :D
---
Awesome! What's your gamer tag?
---
I'll add you up!
---
I can't for the life of me figure out how to make it go up different stories of a build.
---
It also takes up a bunch more budget... I might up going back to wires even though they're ugly.
---
So sorry to hear this. I hope you'll get some wasteland justice soon. 
---
IIRC, the mutated ferns become flash ferns.  
---
Flash ferns are violet flux.
---
Home&amp;contents insurance??
---
Wow looks really like an aircraft. Impressive with these limited building possibilitys.
---
How do you manage to spawn on the ship and not anywhere in the sky?
---
Really hate the card system!!
---
I've got a hybrid build where I can use rifles, heavy weapons or melee... The only advice I can give is don't be hoarder. If you're not going to use it, just get rid of it. Take an inventory of all your weapons, decide what's interesting to you and what you think you're going to be primarily using and experiment with them. Run West Tek and Whitesprings a few times with the various weapons your build/play style is geared towards and make your final decision. After that just let all the extra stuff go... Sell it, drop it, give it away, whatever... Trust me, in a day or two you won't even care about the stuff you've gotten rid of. You'll have space to collect actual useful things like springs and screws and everything else. You'll also be able to focus your build and squeeze every last inch out of it, and you'll adapt to farming in order to fuel it. It's a much more pleasurable experience playing that way. Soon you'll be just passing on legendaries without a second thought, and only taking things that are direct upgrades to what you're already using.
---
Promise not to tell your wife. Does trouserpanther have a paypal or anything like that? I didn't see him list one in the linked post. I don't have a whole lot myself but my brother went through the same thing he did and his workplace came through for him and his family and got him a new tv and ps4 when his place was busted into. Wouldn't mind helping out for a similar experience for this guy. 
---
i do like the system but it felt like most of the interesting cards where in the charisma and luck trees hope fully if this is implemented there will be new perk cards that are more interesting added in
---
YES. I want a bear or a cryptid. I feel like even thought there's a lot to choose from for wall decor, most of it lacks substance.
---
I'm down to donate as well.
---
I got a missile launcher I can't use yet 🤣
---
Agreed. I too managed to get flux I was actually looking for, so that's the bright side, but that's not the point. 
---
What really irked me was the players who launched the nuke arrived and were obviously really happy with themselves for ruining the event, doing thumbs up and generally being obnoxious. 
---
I'm not big on pvp, I'll hit back in defense but I wont initiate it. But them? I just had to fire a few warning shots at them. 
---
Might I suggest melee? Knives are cheap, fast, low weight, and most importantly ammo free. Take a few knives with you next time. Max out your lockpick and hacker perks too. A good supply of stims, and maybe some chemical enhancements wouldn't be a bad idea either. Until you're confident in the nuke silos it probably won't hurt to do it as part of a team.
---
Thank for the ideas. (1) I'm collecting Chameleon armor pieces as my character is stealth but for character-side weight reduction that's a good idea. (2) Yessss... my precious... this is hard. (3) I do a lot of donations to suitcases in stations but yeah, see (2).
---
Maybe I obsess over my weapons a little too much.
---
That’s very kind, good luck to you too, hope the RNG drops you something good over the weekend
---
You'll be paying raiders "protection money" soon lol. Anyway I like what ur doing for new players good job 👍
---
Yeah there are people that just want to watch the world burn and its sad.
---
Have the same problem, hopefully someone has the answer.
---
Unfortunately I’m not on PS4 but that’s very kind of you, thank you for the offer, good luck out there with anything your looking for from the event 🎈🎉
---
I like the idea, but can see them adding the option via the atom shop. Which would be a shame.  
---
Yeah I did too, but then was like I have to drink so much beer everytime and hit some strong creatures with a weak weapon this isn't worth the time.
---
So, you want everything now? See if you can find the Dev room, then go nuts. Oh, and then get banned. The stuff in there is supposed to eventually make it to '76. If you want everything all at the same time, wait until '76 gets a G.O.T.Y version. Otherwise, just like the rest of us.
---
Lol you got downvoted for this comment when another guy made the [same comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b4a5tf/is_it_just_me_or_are_the_daily_challenges_getting/ej5c3q0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) and got 70+ upvotes
---
I don't think they should give you shit based on your shirt, but let's not act like the game isn't hot garbage. Played the BETA and even  a little bit after launch. First Fallout game I couldn't finish. The game deserves all the hate it gets and thensome. Unfinished and shouldn't have seen the light of day until it got more polish. 
---
That being said for those of you here who enjoy it, keep enjoying it. If that is your escape and how you choose to unwind good on you. 
---
No, only fallout76.ini and fallout76prefs.ini
---
I don't know why they are not in the game. They appeared in the game trailer [https://i.imgur.com/2t4ZJlU.png](https://i.imgur.com/2t4ZJlU.png)
---
You can use Blue and Red paint to repair the Commie Whacker. 
---
Not to be rude. This is a survival like game. If there’s something you can’t do. Make it so you can do it. All the tools are there.  
---
Maybe when the prestige system is fully explained some of these would make sense but most of these take away from the core aspect of This game. 
---
I just went over to the forest and kicked it around high spawn areas - it’s a great way to get the kill x amount of enemies challenges done quickly! 
---
 They have been high on skooma 
---
I had the same issue after last patch, then a couple of days ago all my regular daily quests started triggering again. For Camden, fast travelling anywhere in the Ash Heap area triggers that one for me.
---
what prestige system? this supposed to be a rework of FO76's lackluster perkcards so that QOL of life things are off to the side not affecting your interesting perks
---
Thanks, you should. I like to see different CAMPS
---
Knew it!
---
Nice, its a good spot
---
Of my melee collection my all rise does the most damage on consecutive hits but the noise of it puts me off using it 24/7 so I switch to my instigating fire axe, it’s less base damage but that 1st hit when the enemy is full health packs enough punch to make it a one hit kill in many situations without the annoying crackling noise but I would probably use the All Rise almost exclusively if not for the static crackling noise of it lol
---
Enemies level up to 100 tops........just saying. Awesome to hear you got your ass kicked. Sounds like it happens often...
---
Thanks! I like the frame on your pic. Looks like an old hotel postcard
---
This one made me laugh the first time I did it because there was a depressing song on the radio, so I felt like yeah I'd do this if I'd hit rock bottom, But 76 times!? How about 10 Bethesda.
---
It triggers for me if I don’t fast travel there but instead walk there from the Nuka Cola factory
---
There was mention of a prestige system coming at some point. 
---
I will admit some of the perk cards are bland and need a pick me up. But adding a skill system or side perks or traits isn’t going to do much. If anything it’s going to make things easy. Which they are now. That will just force builds to be even simpler and make way for less creativity.

Go to the Watoga Station Vendor Robot. no matter what level you are, you still have a chance of getting the handmade rifle mods. Today I found the handmade rifles plans at the Watoga Vendor and bought them even though I was level 120. Don't listen to crap about handmade rifle plans only spawning at level 15-44 - they have an equal chance of spawning no matter what level you are
---
It's all drinking related I notice, so they're trying to show you the uses of alcohol. But I've noticed that partyboy perk doesn't effect the new drinks, only the vanilla ones that came out on day one which is annoying.
---
Hey, it's fine man. It dropped for me last night, thanks for being thoughtful. Take care, friend
---
Yea, conduit is missing a few key pieces imo. Need a taller wall piece that reaches to the ceiling of the floor above. More wall based pieces in general. A radiator with multiple connectors. Lights with fewer connectors. The radiators also need a bit larger range...
---
Yeah but all rise is just a super sledge. 
---
So if you found a super sledge with instigating,  it'll still do more than the instigating  axe. 
---
Get rid of every melee that does not have swingspeed except AllRise.   Get rid of every 1*.   
---
Thanks for letting me know. As it turns out this has not worked for me.
---
Things I have tried throught the three occasions I have been hit with this bug and have yielded no positive results:
---
\- Fast travel to a location in the Ash Heap other than Camden Park with and without the uniform.
---
\- Frast travel to Camden Park with and without the uniform.
---
\- Walk to the park from the Charleston station with and without the uniform.
---
\- Try to interact with the bots, terminals and activators from the original quest (clock, locker etc) in the park - including the boss - with and without the uniform with or without killing the native mobs of the area.
---
\- All of the above alone, in party with members that do not have the quest active/have the quest active/have just completed the quest.
---
\- Repeatedly punch the desk in frustration.
---
\- Scream blue murder.
---
I always thout Fasnact celebrations were Germanic peoples' version of Fat Tuesday. It isn't about the end of winter, well at least since the Church converted the Germanic tribes to Catholicism, but was the feasts leading up to the Tuesday before Lent. 
---
a melee build on?
---
Do you use the Animal Whisperer perk to get the Brahmin and Deathclaws? Love your vids.
---
They took the game? Good luck selling that off in black market for anything more than $5. Must be amateurs!
---
And a partridge in a pear tree. 
---
Someone must've dropped/glitched them.
---
that's def a part of the "cold case" quest. (The missing kid quest from WWWP)
---
I don't think I have walked that particular route for a while. Will try that when I am back home, thanks.
---
RARE MASK, what you gonna do about it?
---
Hi there, I know this post is old and you probably wont reply, but I am AVxAustral, Voids girlfriend and co-streamer. Void would love to talk to you. 
---
TOTAL DISCLOSURE: We have not used any hacks or exploits to max level. We have streamed 99% of what we have done in 76 and did extremely specified builds to min max. We've met others who chest in the game and do not agree with any of it at all. We simply played an immense amount of the game and did 12+ hour streams during the beta and launch. Feel free to come chat about it in either our twitch or discord, and thanks for giving your time and reading if you did. 
---
Generally shallow people wear things to show off affiliation with stuff that makes them appear to be in touch with all the trends going down at time, so people think they are great. They were judging you on that basis. You not caring about that unwritten rule doesn't matter to them.
---
Ofc and thank you. All I want is the jester mask
---
The quests and challenges feel like chores :/ 
---
Insurance claim.. get a new one..  if you don't have insurance...this is why you do.
---
Same here, have over 20 luck and never even saw the beret drop. Luckily someone was willing to give me an extra so I gave back every plan in return. Glad I did considering I’ve done the event 50+ times now. I’ve done this with the bots never getting touched, we’ve let some die, certain ones live, we had someone do everything themself to see if maybe that would increase a certain drop rate, we’ve tried not popping balloons and popping everyone, collected intestine on a previous server joined a new one to nuke yet still nothing. Hell even decorating the barn in certain orders. Pretty sure the .03% droprate is true, but all we can do is keep marchin! 
---
Yes! Totally agree about the “pick a card” thing that pops up when you just want to switch out a card real quick. It’s not that big of a deal but, if you do it several times in one night it’ll drive you nuts.
---
Well I hate to part with things too so I use Excavator power armour 24/7 with calibrated shocks, I carry all my chems on me and use travelling pharmacy 3, I carry all my ammo as well and use the ammo weight reducing perk at max too. I keep no aid, food, chems, ammo in my stash just weapons armour and mats at a level of 100 each for most things except ballistic fibre (200) and just 50 of gold silver crystal and that’s more than I need as I don’t use energy weapons, keeping things out of my stash that would weigh less if carried on me lets me horde a good amount of weapons and I can manage on the 800 limit, would be tricky without the power armour with calibrated shocks though
---
Great idea. Loved the air raid, all those bos heavies falling out the sky was epic. Shame it turned out they were a raiding party, destroying the innocent robots of the whitespring. 
---
It's a good thing that he managed to save her from enjoying herself! What a good boyfriend he is. And your friend? Tremendous strength of character and strength of will there. A sterling pair, the two of them. 
---
Drink 50 alcohol is a stupid one, there should be some sort of downside to drinking more alcohol before the previous has worn off, like gun away or just a small health loss or being sick resulting in hunger at least something. But the game has you hammering beer as quick as possible to stupid challenges with no downsides.
---
"There's too much content!" Seriously guys, come on.
---
Just stop. 
---
That means the guy coming in is loaded aswell...
---
If I found one of those it would make my day, the instigating super sledge is the dream lol
---
A spatula melee weapon that does fire damage.  Call it "Served Hot". Make a flamethrower called "Cooked to Order". Last one... an apron that says, "Nuke the Cook".
---
It'd be weird cause I have a female character but I'm male lmao
---
It's so annoying when some edgy hobo bitch slap my pet to death with a deathclaw gauntlet or whatever. Cool melee build you got buddy, bet it feels *so good* oneshotting everything huh? Bloodied I assume? Very original.
---
Or when you have a brahmin pen and some lvl 2 noob just kills it with whatever trash he picked up along the way, because destroying brahmin pens doesn't get you wanted for whatever meekly reason, or maybe it's the pvp restriction for people under lvl 5 idk. Then they just be on their way like some toddler, no more wiser.
---
Pets really should respawn after some time. It's so lame.
---
Unarmed, one handed, two handed?
---
Xbox one? What do you mean? 
---
I wish there was an item like the Brahmin pen. Each animal could have a thing that is repairable 
---
The first time I did this, I laughed fot a good 3 minutes. The owl mask just looks so funny but matches power armor well.
---
Sorry for the downvotes. This sub does not tolerate any criticism of fo76 
---
Add me.  alteron_command and visit my shop next to Whitesprings train station when I'm on. I sell allsorts. cheap prices too 
---
Works for me too but I always wonder if folk wonder what I’m doing smacking a glitched sloth with a fire axe, I probably look like I’m having a tantrum over it lol 😂
---
I have heard this too. It makes sense considering how other things work with shotguns. 
---
Hey man I’m sorry about what happened to you and your family.  You got a paypal or something?  The Xbox one fallout 76 bundle is $399.99 right now and I’d wager this community can get you pretty damn close to that.
---
There is a guaranteed deathclaw spawn at the very bottom of the Emenett Mountain Disposal site - high level players usually get a glowing deathclaw level 91
---
I've got 4 berets, but I have done the event about 40 times
---
I always stick the Lowbie legendary and what ever other random things cluttering up my inventory into the icebox by the end of the parade.  It's never something I'd use and I make civil war hats for the vendors anyway. 
---
Two handed. 
---
I don't go recording every aspect of myself playing? Like if the masked dropped how would I even get evidence in time? You deny seeing it after the fact. 
---
Thats kinda a undue burden of proof. 95% of players probably don't record or even screenshot. I'm on console, there is no way I could get evidence before the notification disappeared.
---
Especially on non-power armour builds. You don't have to stop to use them.
---
They need to remove the guy off the horn. 
---
Is this whay you tell someone before they do a nigh impossible task?
---
It’s that darn Nukashine, destroying the fabric of society! 😆
---
The masked tweaker.
---
I have observed this behaviour pretty much with every toon I have leveled.
---
Blackwater Mine is a not only a high-transit area but also where Uranium Fever takes place.
---
I am not sure if this is the intended behaviour or not because is pretty much impossible to tell what is intended and what isn't however if someone enters the mine and triggers a level appropriate respawn but does not kill the mobs - and those you encounter are more often that not left untouched because they are outside the path that leads to the 'chamber' where Uranium Fever takes place - they will remain that level regardless of whom enters the mine next.
---
Your best bet is to either find help from someone higher level or do this on a server that has been freshly restarted and hope you are the first in.
---
This also applies to the other quest too where certain locations you will have to visit have a high chance to contain mobs that are max level for the area so... strap in, gonna be a bumpy ride.
---
I’m so incredibly sorry to hear that. Sometimes people make really shitty decisions that will make you question humanity. 
---
An Xbox can always be replaced in the future and hopefully Fallout 76 will still be around, if so we’ll be here waiting for you. The most important thing is that you, your wife and pets were not harmed!
---
Sending lots of good vibes your way!
---
Lol. Deal with it.
---
I got you covered, GT is isic
---
True...
---
love it.
---
Move points from Perception, Charisma and Endurance to max out agi and luck, pays off better imo
---
I'm not excited about camp decoration if we have such a small budget.
---
Still have one? I’ll be on in just a couple minutes. 
---
Half the available masks are locked behind a .03% drop rate chance.  I'd be fine with it if it was a couple, but 5/10 is a bit much. 
---
On the 2nd day of the event I received the owl mask 3 times, on one occasion it dropped with 1 bot dying, one time with no bots dying and the 3rd with 2 bots dying so I don’t think it makes a difference, however the owl mask was dropping when lots of people were doing the event and numbers have dwindled since. I’ve noticed that for some reason when there are only 2 or 3 people doing the event I get the toothy mask every time, 4 times in a row yesterday. It’s probably all just coincidence but part of me wonders what would drop if a full server all turned up for the event and got 5 bots across the line?
---
How in the fuck have they not figured out clothing and armor slots in their own engine? 
---
Literally dozens of modders have no problem with this, it's not a bug, it's fucking laziness, pure and simple.
---
I thought this was the rust subreddit at first
---
Especially with the current rate of items spoiling as well.
---
A lot *are* dicks. My good friend and I have PvP bloodied melee builds, but we don't: attack people at their camps or destroy camps, keep attacking people who don't want to participate or take junk from low level players. 
---
I always see them on the beach north east of the lakeside cabins. between the cabins, and the bridge. sometimes it's cats, or mirelurkes, but usually it's foxs 
---
I have one for sale on PS4.
---
I consistently find foxes around Big Fred's BBQ Shack.
---
Some drinks for these quests are also available within the bar itself. At least rum.
---
I've been playing since I posted this... I just got disconnected for the first time. Damn this game locks you in.
---
It's also getting really dull. Login: oh look, more alcohol related dailies... 
---
Wouldn't mind so much, but I've also gotten the same crafting recipe from Biv 3x in a row, so no chance of even completing half of them!
---
Count me in
---
I built my CAMP in this exact spot, but you have inspired me to possibly spread it over both sides of the road, where previously I had it all clustered on one side. Looks amazing, very fallout-y!
---
This is caused by the spawn system. When somebody enters an area the monsters inside will spawn according to the allowed level range for that area and the players level. However, when a player leaves the area the monsters don't despawn, they just wait for an unsuspecting player to come by and get beaten down. I believe this particular location also has a bug involving the enemy AI. Normally enemies are supposed to leash like in Fallout 4 even if they detect you, but in this mine once you make one enemy angry you'll make all of them angry and they all rush you.
---
I've discovered something: I'm having no problems playing, even SBQ fights, and her corpse loot list loads near instantaneously for me.
---
EXCEPT...when a certain player I had been teaming with is on the same server.  Then, I get horrid hangs and disconnects.
---
They're on an unreliable wireless connection.  Sometimes I've played with them on a nearly empty server, and we've had no problem with SBQ fights.  But if there's a large group, and they're on, I'm screwed.  I've started actively avoiding them, and everything goes fine.  Like tonight.  Then they showed up...I hung right before the queen died.  Had to quit after a few minutes and sign of recovering.
---
time to start a new run. or be boring and become a god.
---
Google the map name and number
---
Look at the videos
---
You can get the certificate again by talking to the gutsy robot at the front desk in Camp McClintock. At least that's what happened with me the other day, quite the surprise getting the certificate out of nowhere when I talked to it.
---
I love classical music unreasonably, but it was a bit of an odd choice for the jukebox. This suggestion is solid. 
---
Start a fund me account. Post it. I got  $20 on it for a fellow wastelander. Even if you are on xbox. Maybe others will help out too.
---
Give them to me
---
I just did it for my second run ever. First time all robots died,we failed. Tonight we completed it with 8 others and we got all robots to the end and I got the toothy. 
---
Oh no way! So when rihgt after i drink it, how about to get smashed because thats the one i was trying to do
---
Tell people it's a new butchering mechanic where you get extra loot by butchering certain monsters.
---
I'm currently doing this to a cousin with Sekiro. It's funny being a dick to the game I haven't played yet but it's only for fun, please don't hurt me.
---
Did you look at the extra part of get smashed? There’s different sub challenges to it :) 
---
Do you need to keep the perk card on to keep him tamed? 
---
This game handles network traffic very strangely.  I was told outright by Bethesda, that game crashes can be caused by network problems.
---
And I've noticed that if I play with people who have bad connections, my game will become unstable too.
---
Cool idea, I kinda like it.  Pre-war preservatives could just be replaced by salt (with extra salt required for canned meats and soups).  I don't think people who can at home really use chemical preservatives, it's the cooking and sealing that keeps it from spoiling.
---
Having canned fruit broken down to fresh might be a problem.  You could just keep re-canning fruit to restore it's condition.  You could add some new recipes that use canned variants though.  Make the fancier recipes require fresh, but for pies and stuff have canned versions.
---
You'd probably also need to balance the unlimited condition of canned food.  Make canned require 2-3 of the fresh food for an equivalent item.  Or have canned food lose all perks except hunger/thirst satisfaction.  I don't think many prepackaged food items have bonuses right now so that would be consistent.
---
I like it 👍
---
Naw, cross bow. It hurts more. Lol
---
I am not a troll ,i just dont like attention whores. Probably someone gets robbed every minute somewhere on the planet, go write them too. Soon we'll see sick people coming here and complaining. Sure, life is rough but i'm here to read about computer games, not someone's problems.
---
you tube
---
In the Wild Appalachia patch notes they mentioned how coming soon we would be able to display bobble heads and some other items in our  camps. And I believe someone datamined info about bobblehead stands. 
---
I'm not trying to be a wet blanket I just dont think we should expect to able to be placing down a teddy bear collection just yet .
---
Man, that’s absolutely fucked. Hope you get your stuff back soon
---
can you link where you read that scrapping a mod unlocks a plan?
---
Something like this for instance?
---
First result searching for 'Fallout 76 Treasure Maps':

---
I believe I remember reading that it would have been used to allow players to influence the weather on the map but was sadly cut :( It's possible we could see it return in nuclear winter as that mentions "new ways to change the game" 
---
“This community” without an offer yourself?
---
1. Mics. Basic communication. The community didn't want to stand together and get this shitty online model removed when it was announced, now live with COMMUNITY events. 
---
placing razorgrain is so tiring this would be such a nice improvement 
---
If it is a one star it’s not worth the stash weight. Two star or three star only and they must be good drops or your main two weapons.  Do not keep any nocturnal, stalkers or any other junk legendary effects. Your looking for melee with bloodied swing speed weight reduction. Or instigating with the same. Ranged you want bloodied explosive/ fire rate furious fire rate crit damage vats refill. You want things that go good with each other and combo. If you have a bunch of one and two start that have no good effects toss them to the vendors they are not worth any ones time. 
---
Also wasted atoms on this thinking it was playable instrument. It looks so goofy I want to delete it and forget about it. 
---
I got lvl 50 yesterday while I was doing the monster mash event and the trophy didn't pop up :(, I didn't know that the event was bugged.
---
I'll keep lvling up in the event but I'll try to lvl up from 99 to 100 far away from the monster mash event, I hope the trophy will pop.
---
Talk about immersion. Just sitting on top of a hill, naked, buzzed as can be, pickin of varmint with a sniper rifle. Doesn’t get more Appalachian than that! Gonna build some chairs on top of my camp now. 
---
When you look at an item, ask yourself, “When did I last use this?” If the answer is “I don’t know,” then it isn’t worth that slot. If you’re not actually using the item, then it might as well just be a brick.
---
It surprisingly triggered for me today at random.  First time I’ve had an actual daily challenge since the last patch. 
---
You are right. All the tools are there. Get perk cards, have enough special, switch to your lockpicking perks, lockpick, get stuff, switch back to combat cards, move on. 
---
That is the process right now that most people are using. I agree with your ideas about how there should be things that we cannot do in the game. But Bethesda allows this perk card switching at any time, and implemented many poorly thought out passive cards that cause people to be switching cards a lot. Because it makes sense to do, and it’s a system that Bethesda included. But it’s probably getting abused because of their poorly thought out perk card system. 
---
So I say either they need to take away the switching on the fly all together - and truly lock in our character choices. Or they need to rework the system and fix the passive cards and how they work.
---
Immersion!?
---
That.... AND! a Beerhat ... NOW THATS WHAT I CALL IMMERSION.
---
Yes, please. It annoys me that they float. 
---
Haha I’m with ya I’m lvl 69 and I haven’t came across anything better than my nocturnal ski sword. I mean for the weight and damage alone it’s my #1 melee. With gladiator perks equipped I do good. I’m sure there is something better but I don’t know what it is.
---
It cant be expected that everyone will get a mic, and without any structure, what stops people from arguing over leadership or trying to get a game plan together.
---
A game that has teams and a clear objective works. But this expects people who are essentially all equals to boss each other around. It would only work in a minority of cases, and is an insane expectation of a customer.
---
That is, if the rare masks even rely on the death of some bots, which is completely unconfirmed and looks more to be a rumour than anything else.
---
Yep Google exists. It's not a bad thing that I'd rather ask the community and get the same result but yeah dude, thanks! 
---
Im really sorry for your loss. I hope you can get your stuff back. Atleast they didnt hurt your pets, that would be another level of cruelty. 
---
No one uses the fat man. 
---
Its sad that the beret is rare which is what rarity should be not how the 5 mask are really rare feel like the people that get them are 1% dam they are privileged lol.
---
I wish most things could be seen/heard from afar. I just built a camp on the other side of the mountain from Watoga. I could hear the nukes hitting fissure prime but I couldn’t see the cloud or fallout. So disappointing 
---
Got a second one to drop on the last run before I logged off i think (will have to recheck). I've been leaving duplicate items from the festival at the overseer's cache at Flatwoods so if you're on PS4 I can give it to you for free instead of dropping it there.  
---
Thanks all!
---
:)
---
That's the point of team games. To get teams together. Then you play as a team. Ya know, like the community TEAM game setting. 
---
EVERYONE has a Mic that would work in their home. They all came with phones and a few other devices all the time up until the last 4-5 years. Not everyone decides to use it. 
---
Glad that it did!
---
In this toon it seems to be... peculiar. Only the Toxic Valley ones seem to consistently trigger. I don't even get the ones from The Forest anymore, not even Ecological Balance.
---
Shame that is the ones I like the least but hey, at least is something I guess.
---
I like the ones in The Mire best but can't remember the last time I got any of those.
---
However the lack of Mr Fuzzy Tokens is starting to irk me, that damned outfit is taking long enough without these hiccups :P
---
Cool!
---
I usually find 3 here. One of them almost always runs away from me before I can get to it. lol
---
At first, the lack of human characters really bummed me out.  Then, the actual players made up for that.  I've encountered some players that really rubbed me the wrong way.  But, that's a small minority.  The sense of community has won me over.  This is only helped with the lack of caps at the vendor locations and the limited storage space.  When I first created a character, I had a couple guys randomly appear and drop me loot.  Now, when I need to clear stuff out, I check the map for a low-level player and fast travel to give them some stuff.  I'm a huge fan of this game, and I'm excited to be in the beginning of something that's only going to grow.
---
So yeah, lack of detail on how to donate me prevents me from going any further. 
---
Shit sucks though, hate it when people steal other people's shit.
---
I just got back into the game two days ago and have already added 100lbs to my stash. I went back, just wanting to attend the event at Helvitia, get some masks and come back when there was more content. But you know how it goes. "ooo, I need to bulk some stuff, lemme head up to Morgantown High and grab some plastic". "Hmm, base looks a little bare, how did I think this was cute, she needs some more decorations". Next thing you know, you've jumped to FS Prime, at every nuke alert and your waste deep in weapons and armour you think "you might need just in case".
---
I remember a tip from a personal organiser who said, "If you haven't worn it in a year, donate it". That's the case with weapons. If you haven't used it in, say, a month IRL. Its time to go. 
---
Its a game centred around survival. You need only the most necessary and universally useful tools at hand. You don't have space for keepsakes and "just in cases". You only have space for brain splattering, high damage weapons of mass destruction! I generally turf any weapons that I only rarely take out. The only weapons I keep that are heavy is my TSE 50. machine gun because I know its useful in SBQ events. All weapons I keep are used in a rotation so I can stockpile ammo for stashed weapons while out and switch and store low ammo weapons each time I get back to CAMP. 
---
Keep a small rotation of weapons that suit your build and don't bother keeping more then one ammo type, unless it is totally necessary.  
---
Into a reactor to power growth.
---
Pleasure.
---
I used that 'guide' myself and the only one that took me a few minutes to find was 'Savage Divide Treasure Map #7', the rest was fairly straightforward.
---
Agreed, it's getting boring just doing things while drunk, it was okay for the first week of the dlc, but they need to go back to the way it was. Don't mind the odd drunk task but it's just not worth the effort at this point.
---
The nuke silo itself 
---
On PlayStation but I got it earlier today. Thanks though, I appreciate the offer. 
---
Wait until you see the guy that posted about his house being robbed and losing his Fallout76 to robbers ....
---
Seems silly ro put a cap on it
---
Isn’t it a tad bit early in the fallout lore for iguana bits to be considered, “you know what” meat
---
I knew one of you guys would link me up. Cheers 
---
So basically you want a pvp server with no consequences?
---
Thank you! I was afraid I was the only one with this problem. Lately I've been able to do more weekly challenges in a day than the daily ones.
---
Tip of the day, don’t be a duper
---
Before the game came out it was nervous but ok with the lack of private servers. But now that they have shown that they have failed, they need to return to what they have done in the past. put out a buggy mess and let the modders keep the game alive far longer than what  they released warranted. Let the modders fix what they didn't bother to do themselves. 
---
Thanks! 😊
---
I can't get behind the idea that anything in the game forced people to dupe. Maybe you didn't get the legendary you wanted, but it wasn't because they weren't dropping legendaries.
---
Hi. I'm interested in bloodied meat hook. What's your asking price and can I get first refusal. PS4 pirateglenn1 
---
Flatwoods or Vault 76?
---
I don't know if nuke target are restricted.
---
Some like to nuke the DMV.
---
You could also try nuking a place where there's almost no ennemies. Or, places where there monsters you don't like. What about Wendigo cave ?
---
lol
---
Did you sort it as I can help if not? 
---
haha, actually, where are the silos? Are they right near the entrances?
---
The title was crafted to capitalize on the anger towards bethesda. If one was guilty of greatly mis-representing the truth and truly apologetic, they should make efforts to not do so again. 
---
Yeah it's a really good way to restock, given they're expensive to craft
---
There's another one comming. Mostly black if i remember.
---
Just right of the workshop, before the gold resources digger. There's at least 6 rows of wild razorgrain, it looks green initially so you just have to walk the field and look for the crop rows, once you find it, it's very easy to find again and you'll never need to go anywhere else for razorgrain. 30-40 easy even without green thumb. 
---
I've figured you're trolling so this is my last reply to you. (You care more to argue than the subject of the argument).
---
1. Your phone microphone is not compatible with xbox, nor is any other microphone other than ones designed to work with the console. And if you're expecting me to hand my phone number out to gamers, ill take your number first.
---
2. This is not a "team game". A team game is something like football, or Battlefield 4. This is an open world/mmo/rpg with the option to form your own teams. The teams are limited to 4 persons. I like your down to earth spirit but you can't really co-ordinate an entire server unless you're martin luther king.
---
3. It is only my opinion that some people come across to me as devolved, particularly you. Your liking to argue, is actually direct evidence of why human nature is preventing such an activity.
---
Anyway I will continue rational discussions with anyone else who replies, but I have lost my patience with you.
---
I'll have you know, that if I were on reddit to troll, I would be much funnier than you.
---
Thank you! 😊
---
End game, such as it is/was is extremely bad/non-existent.  Needs more varied missions/events.  Now the game is just fun in short spurts to try and farm legendaries (which NEVER drop anything good it seems) which is getting very boring fast.  Farm ghouls, find random stuff to fix broken armor/guns, Make or find some food/drink, look for rare valuable stuff to sell to broke vendors for pennies on the dollar.
---
I find myself playing for 1/2 hour at a time now, checking a few fav spots, get bored, quit.
---
yeah, there are restrictions around the early game parts. You can't nuke 76 or Flatwoods.
---
Fucking wendigo cave. Good idea. 
---
I glad you like it! Thanks! 😊
---
I was so stoked when I found that 🍺 🧢!
---
Some people may already be in a group, or prefer to be playing alone. 
---
Personally, whenever I receive an invite without knowing who it is or talking to them in-game first I’m not interested in grouping up. A lot players probably have their own goals, and since they don’t know what yours are, they don’t group up.
---
Try using your mic first 
---
I glad you like it! Thanks 😊
---
Lol what are you on about dude chill out 
---
If it is crashing another program, I would guess that somehow it is messing with your allocated memory. I'm not sure how that can happen. How is your stability in other games?
---
Or both!
---
Nuke whitesprings for the lulz 
---
Yeah I was shocked to find that one was about 50 feet from my camp (and 50 feet down the cliff)
---
1) yes it is, anything but iPhone. They're not making some special connection just for their controllers to waste money. 
---
2) No, not 100% of the time but the community didn't want to stand together to not make it forced online so tweak events are expected. 
---
3) just drink cleaning products, I'm done. If you are too stupid to know how an MMO works then maybe it's not the whole community, just you.
---
Ah okay, so the same thing I find tons of in the big after a Queen. Got it.
---
Hey this is a really nice thing to do man thank you! I'll be adding you for sure :)
---
I just started a new character and was level 5 arriving at Helvetia.  It makes me appreciate my higher level character much more.  
---
Puts the fear back into the game having suiciders running at you at that level lol....
---
Excellent! Send me a message and let me know how I can help. 
---
I never accept invites for one major reason;
---
If they're a griefer im showing them where my base is and giving them a free trip there 
---
One word... Griefers. 
---
I read that as something a lot kinkier
---
i did think of lowering the special back down to 10 but wasnt sure about that 
---
This bot is annoying when doing suggestions 
---
Tell him to change his password, quick via the web
---
Go smoke some dope band aid boy. A quick look at your posts shows why a lot of what you say doesn't quite make sense.
---
And I had to do break my own word just to tell you.
---
Not even all the cleaners in the world could clear that head of yours. Keep talking. So glad I don't smoke weed anymore. You're helping me understand why I don't miss it.
---
1400 mins,  still no beret, not feeling the love 
---
I see a business opportunity here.
---
I have heard from reliable sources that there is a working printing machine in Fenway Park, Boston.
---
Fence the area, charge a fee for accessing the mound and sell 'totally not counterfeit' Treasure Maps at very reasonable prices? :P
---
Yeah, it's still works. My camp is upgraded and another "My Prydwen" 2.0 is coming soon 😃
---
Finally did it last night. Just after posting. Pretty cool event. Simple to do. Was cool because there was about 5-8 other players there too.
---
"I know I'm wrong and no longer have an argument so I'll downvote you and dig through your post history to speak ill rather than admit I'm wrong. That'll prove my point."
---
Okay bud. 
---
I don't know. The game is always drop me inside the ship 😃
---
Thank you! I glad you like it. "My Prydwen 2.0" is coming soon! 😉😁
---
$50 on eBay, apparently. But don’t be that guy.. (or girl, sorry, don’t want to make assumptions)
---
Power of bear arms mate. I carry more firepower than half the wasteland in my pocket. I've got a fat man with the same 90% reduction as daisy cutter, it literally weighs 0.6 lbs in my pocket. 
---
Nope.
---
I have this issue only in F76, playing and then the game freezes, I can still hear the in-game sounds, but then it closes and Chrome tabs stop responding (not Chrome itself)
---
They definitely need to rework the taming mechanics, taming and respawning are huge issues when your ‘re-roll’ to find a specific monster for taming. 
---
Which* ;)
---
So great stats, infinite ammo, 0 weight ammo, that sounds like great balancing. /s
---
Nah, going back in the vault and sleeping like yao guai
---
Just for something different hey?
---
I have melee weapons, the problem is that are so many robots and the laser turrets, and some robots are lvl 50, they are like a f*** stone, I have 8 on Str and some perk cards for melee weapons, but my damage is low, I can't stay killing a robot like 5 seconds because the other 20 friends come to kick my ass xD
---
Because it's cool hip and trendy. "All the cool youtubers hate the game and therefor, so do I"
---
I wouldn't say infinite ammo a lot of people miss shots, I mean the Gauss rifle doesn't seem very balanced IMO.
---
Oh even better how they fuck over any melee builds. I have no means of effective damage when they're in the air, not to mention their broken hitbox.
---
I usually play all the day too (on the weekends) so I think we can play this evening or in the night, I will add you to my friends when I enter in the game later.
---
Your best bet is a shotgun with some high brass buck shot. Anyway, I read that a huge amount of burglaries are done by people the victim knows. I knew the guy that stole from me. We were good friends for a long time then drugs turned him sour. If this person was able to take so much from you in a short amount of time then there’s a good chance they already knew where to look. 
---
Without sounding like a dick, what’s the point? Why? I see this ALL the time in various places. What is the obsession with HUMAN npc’s?
---
I don’t think the majority of people are aware that we DO have Npc’s in the game, and if they were to add human npc’s, they would function the EXACT same as the current NPC’s.
---
You know, Grahm, Rose, EVERY vendor bot, they will literally be motionless. Repeating robots with a different texture.
---
Nothing will change apart from the visual aspect, please someone explain to me, your reason for human npc’s and your actual expectations, it’s a multiplayer title you won’t EVER be getting NPC companions. The system between online/offline, multiplayer/singleplayer, expectancies. Requirements all change.
---
Nuke the very bottom left corner of the map
---
I must be lucky as I haven't experienced any bugs with Biv, but i've only done probably 6 or more. 
---
What are the bugs? What console?
---
They’re basic bitches,  easily influenced weak minded chuds,  Don’t worry,  you’re cooler.
---
Some people say I'm crazy like that 
---
Cool, I'll add you too.
---
I had one glitch 2 nights ago, I've got a two shot gatling right beneath a troubleshooters fatman on my weapons list, and while the wheel showed a gatling gun symbol, when i selected it, out came my fatman. 
---
How old is your system and what Windows version do you have?
---
Crashing of Chrome pages would imply there is an issue with the videocard driver, among other possibilities.
---
Logging out is quite odd, implying important user-managing Windows processes have crashed. Check the event viewer for application/system errors.
---
Overall, there could be a RAM stick issue, rarely mainboard issue or unsable PSU/GTX interaction.
---
Survival mode would make more sense if we would have to create new characters. Prepare to get destroyed by trigger happy max level characters with hundreds of duplicated items. Since you can bounce between adventure and survival with your character at any time, people will join survival only to wreck havok and once they have enough for the session they get bored or need help with anything they will join back the adventure mode.
---
That's the comic idiocy of Reddit sometimes 
---
listen for the music to lag and warble towards the end of the parade near the church. the sloth will spawn (i’ve been to a dozen+ events so far) either behind the tree(s) by the parking lot across from the church or next to the church by that little tree you pass at the end of the parade route as you leave the field. 5 of those times it’s been unlootable for me as well but i generally just drop the item since it’s a lower level in hopes that someone who didn’t get a chance will get something. 
---
all in all tho it’s a funass event and brings the community together. i usually lay out for a photo op while the parade assembles. most folks see what’s up and get in the picture as well. 
---
sorry. tldr. off to find that legendary vendor 👀
---
This totally.
---
When a random person on the other side of the map asks and hasn't even voice chatted with you no chance of excepting.
---
Plus I get them in the middle of fire fights and they time out
---
I think the Wastelanders is gonna be when we get Factions.
---
As for Human NPCs, I wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
This games entire shtick (besides Fallout Online) is that we're the NPC's.
---
That’s awesome, nice to see others have a passion for building too! All I need is more budget because there’s still so much I’d love to add to my latest build.
---
I would only except from people near me who have chatted and explained why they want to and what they want to do
---
What are you disagreeing with? 
---
You just agreed with me but with essentially a different product. You know you can use the razorgrain and corn for making things other than beer. 
---
Add TheMyrenos 
---
There's a website called can I run it it looks at your specs and tells you
---
Sorry about that I misread the comment was half asleep. 
---
Not everyone misses shots. It's not a minigun cap rifle, it's a sniper rifle. If you miss a lot then maybe you shouldn't use sniper rifles.
---
Then what about two-shot variants? you shoot 1 cap and get 2 back? i'm sure Bethesda would love adding such a easy way to dupe caps. 
---
Gauss rifle takes a while to charge its shots, the ammo is quite heavy, you don't recover the ammo you spent.
---
Also, why worry about getting lead/steel/gunpowder if you can just shoot caps? The daily ~1k caps you get from selling stuff to vendors is more than enough ammo to last you a couple of days, add to that the fact that you can recover your ammo and a vats player can go on for weeks with those 1000 caps. 
---
I don’t think it’s ok for people to give you shit for your shirt, but don’t act like the game wasn’t a dumpster fire at release. Not everyone base their opinions on what some YouTuber said. I still play the game on occasion, but I’m not ignorant to the fact that this game is an unfinished mess. Every patch seems to break more things than it fixes. If I’m paying for something I expect quality, not a starting point.
---
And I think that’s authentic to what I would be like in a post apocalyptic wasteland. I’m a nice guy and I’m willing to help out if someone is in need. But there are a people out there that like to take advantage and you gotta be sure if you can trust people. that’s something bethesda planned to happen, and it’s cool. But you shouldn’t expect people to just party up with you without any effort to show you are a good guy. 
---
It's a pretty unstable set up for taming...I had a lvl 40 Snallygaster that eventually was dead on login, not sure how. Then on the next login I randomly had a lvl 40 Glowing Radstag that now is either that or a lvl 14 Radstag Doe whenever I login. 
---
Whenever someone comes to my camp I just pray they don't kill my pet...I know plenty have thought about it until they see me there and that I'm a lvl 130. There are so many things to kill in the game, why mine? 
---
lol done. will go get a keycard and do it.
---
I love the works of bethesda. But I must say.. in response to "working as intended" YOU BASTARDS
---
Woooohh you actually turn in the technical data?
---
Where/how to I do that I thought it was just junk held offer from fallout 4 copy/paste
---
Yes i did thank you :)
---
Playing since the BETA only ran into a handful of people that actually use a mic. This is my biggest peeve about the game, I know people dont talk or have their kids set to team, but really? That is one of the things that make 76 work.
---
Lets help him out. If trouserpanther respondes with a paypal account I'll throw 10$ aswell.
---
Yeah the lvl 90+ glowing bloated ghouls are no joke. Which is good, because otherwise the nuke zone would be a doozy. I can one-hit kill them but I see lower geared players get trashed all the time, running away or using height escapes.
---
From the creators of the megasloth comes the ultra-sloth-queen..
---
Agreed. It's certainly well protected. And for right now, There's no reason for it.
---
[u/trouserpanther](https://www.reddit.com/user/trouserpanther) if you still have your laptop look into a wonderful program called gforce now. its currently in beta and is free and allows you to stream games from your steam library and other sources. a cheeper alternative to get you back into gaming
---
This is how weary we are getting
---
Is it for just the fo4 ones or did they also add the cryptids?
---
Flatwoods
---
I'm sure it can, but yeah, you're going have to put some settings on low or medium to do it.
---
PUBLICITY STUNT!
---
Thanks for the input but I'm definitely not interested in spending actual money for this type of stuff.
---
You obviously haven't seen how few there are. As in... noone has seen any.
---
There would be more masks around if bethesda only allowed 3 of each.
---
Mate, just server hop. 
---
Looks to me like they have no clue what they're doing.
---
I and my friends got the game on release day, played for 3 days and left because of all the bad stuff that we're happening. When we heard the news of Survival mode we got pretty excited. It was what we wanted from the game...until we heard all the details.
---
The first months of F76 were awful. Tons of bugs and item aquisition and duplication exploits that it destroyed any balance that the game had.  After months of bug fixing, when the game is somewhat stable, it would be great to start the new mode with clean slate...but nope. Bethesda decided to let everyone join the full PVP survial mode with their armed to the teeth characters and unlimited resources gaind by exploiting the adventure mode, so they can wipe the floor with new and returning players.
---
I was really excited about Survival mode and starting the new adventure from scratch without all the exploits and bugs but I don't feel like getting destroyed by a god mode kids on day1.
---
Me to.
---
Functional, I do my cooking with it
---
Can i turn the shadows off completely like in elder scrolls online?
---
that always gave me huge boost to performance
---
Hear hear!
---
That event just be like that. 
---
&gt;1 foundation 6 walls,
---
I think your problem is that you are building in the 4th dimension
---
If this happens I'll come back to F76 and get my friends to buy it. There is no chance I will play survival mode and get recked by god mode exploiters from adventure mode on day 1.
---
What's the lowest level I can farm this event and what sort of gear should I bring if I'm around level 20-22
---
I was looking for these the other day when decorating my camp, wth bethesda why arent they in the game?
---
I’m sorry for your loss, friend. Well get those ghoul bastards!
---
Good:) there’s a couple of marketplace subs you can try
---
I also forgot to mention that I'll be shitting my pants if they show up
---
It's a name flair.
---
On the (I'm not using the newest reddit layout so if you are my directions might not work)
---
On the right side of the screen look for your user name. Should be just under the subscribe button. Once you find that look next to your name for edit and there you go.
---
Sometimes I don’t accept invites. Mainly because I may not be on very long or I am in the middle of something that would bot be fun for a team member. 
---
You can add me on PS4 TheMeiserVader don’t be offended if I don’t take your invite. Eventually I will though
---
I'm not psychotic, and I don't need a game to play out my psychosis so I don't have to face the results of my urges irl.
---
This makes it easier when you craft. You will only use cards for crafting in passive mode. Which means if you have a card that is high enough you can use it for the crafting of that item. Also you have to have a special point that is high enough to use that card. 
---
It is crazy. I just ignore the level ones
---
You are quite lucky to get a beret on your second run. Its somewhat uncommon.
---
Would love to find a community/group of people on xbox that is more around my age so I would appreciate a dm so I can join up once I get back home :)
---
My base is near here and I can confirm 3-4 always there.
---
Dam 2 months later and I notice this too.
---
Ski swords are to 1 handed as hunting rifles are to rifles
---
Yeah that one is pretty cool
---
Why we are dealing with rare mask dealing robots and it is Rare Masks in binary. 
---
Ask Toothy man
---
At best we would get NPCs like ESO, but probably end up with what we have in other NPCs, repeating lines and no interaction. What people want is an overhaul of the dialogue system. To answer your question OP, I'm hoping it's an alternate start to the game. Like ESO does with every one of its chapters in that new characters start the game with a different prologue. It doesn't make sense people would keep coming out of the vault when it was set to turn off life support after one day
---
This is not just about some legendary gear but any gear, level, resources etc. New players will have no chance at surviving. 
---
I want this skeleton mask too,  does anyone actually have it?
---
Dont you lose a tamed creature when you leave the server?
---
Other human factions entering the area vying for control of resources and looking to interact with you would be very interesting and since they said it starts a whole new campaign storyline it makes some sense seeing as the core of this campaign was the basis for there being no living humans besides us.
---
I truly believe their explanation for no human NPCs was just smoke screen in an attempt to obscure the main plot of the game and not a true goal for continued design to never have human NPCs. 
---
Finally, from a lore perspective it simply makes sense that at some point soon people from outside this region of Appalachia will begin trickling in once the scorch plague had ended.
---
I for one hope it brings us to other maps and brings in true settlement building which is not impossible with a little imagination. 
---
Yes! And personally the whole drinking thing is getting old real quick. It's been going since mardi gras/pancake day and I'm so tired of it.
---
Quest to save your child from mysterious kidnappers vs. Quest to read a bunch of holotapes. No comparison.
---
Love what you did with the metal walls. From the distance in the pic they look like faded windows!! 
---
https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri
---
I think once they roll out passive mode for CAMPS we can finally have safe pets :) my friends and I have lost two house cats now :( not to mention countless others, including my softshell mirelurk yesterday :(
---
Helvetia, during the event
---
Yep just like they wiped the servers after game beta and millions of duped items and other exploits arvantages...oh wait..
---
So you're saying hunting rifles are the best in slot rifle and using any other rifle but a hunting rifle is a waste of a weapon? 
---
Still fairly new to this game... where do you find all the blueprints for this stuff? I’ve found 3-4 blueprints total and I’m level 37... my wood-panel house looks like I don’t know what I’m doing (which is true, but still...).
---
I initially thought this is why the vaults were unaccessible at the beginning, i imagined them “opening” this releasing Humans, to cater for everyone asking for them, it would take some of hatred for the game away too seeing as it’s requested alot of the time
---
I’ve mentioned it a few times but I just want to be able to save a couple of pack load outs. A p/a one, a home/crafting deck and general deck I can quickly switch between.
---
That would be perfect! Then you would only have to play the event between 20 - 50 times. I could handle that!
---
New players a year from now will not have access to item duplication and aquisition exploits. 
---
I would definitely try enabling the page file. 
---
I don't know why operating systems still rely on the archaic concept of virtual memory since memory has not been expensive for many years, but the operating system and applications are designed for it no matter how much ram you have, and can malfunction without it.
---
They have to pawn it off somewhere. Check the nearest gamestop to see if they got a used Xbox one in recently then ask to see security footage. Also check craigslist for your area see if the pictures look familiar.
---
They don't do that much rummaging around in your apartment without sweating a scent. Was it a lone male or a couple? You should be able to distinguish based on their product choices and search pattern. Do they smoke tobacco or weed?
---
Get angry about this and sleep on it, have something to write on when you wake and take note of everything you dreamed.
---
No one so far. But people have seen the blue Mr winters head drop so it might be a rare drop.
---
You're replying to a thread which is showing statistics that imply. NONE have dropped.
---
Theres a big bug difference between rare, and unobtainable.
---
Yes. Also having crashes at the end of the Fasnacht event. Just before the bonfire gets lit.
---
Adding humans changes the formula (depending on how it's done) and I think it's clear to me the reason we don't have them now is NOT because we are supposed to be the npcs but because it would take away from the feeling of despair and loss in the main story. But with the main plot ending and a new one coming , anything can happen.
---
I think people would still be pissed and a lot would still try their luck but the event probably would be more empty. This event seems geared towards a group then solo finishing everything, since a solo might not gather all the stuff in time.
---
I personally believe the western wooded area that is inaccessible atm will be unlocked with the boyscout quest line 
---
Promoting those rare masks in the marketing materials wasn't the best idea either. I have yet to see any of them in-game.
---
Sounds fun!
---
I have just tried all of these "fixes" and not a single one works...  
---
Any other bright ideas ?
---
Are there laws about micro transactions in Japan? I'm genuinely curious. 
---
From what I understood, games like Pokemon go are insanely popular there, which also has micro transactions.
---
Didn’t realize you could get the bath tub plan in this event. 
---
I personally did the even for the realistic stuff. I was really happy to get a couple berets and all of the plans and recipes. Seeing everyone come together was really cool too. But there were people who literally did 100s of these events expecting to get something lol. 
---
I got 30 mini nukes yesterday 
---
I'm glad someone else finds them attractive too ❤️
---
Be cool to do it with player heads as well like what you can do in Minecraft.  
---
Headhunter gang anyone?
---
Yeah. Skull is a skull with a hood and is a rare mask. Toothy man is a face with big teeth, which is common
---
Wish I could help but I’m on vacation! Sorry man if you want to do it around Thursday next week I can
---
I have an instigating 2☆ Instigating grog axe with +40% power swing damage and a 1☆ instigating super sledge they are my favorite weapons.
---
Yeah I've seen someone wearing the blue Mr. Winter mask. But no skull mask, jester,  sun or the horned one. 
---
For long term play after the endgame, definitely this game. Plus now we get teammates.  But the combat experience vs enemies was better overall in 4.
---
My level of affection for Graham and Biv is proof that NPCs were way more important in these games than I realized, and I miss them tremendously. 
---
Besides, in four hours, you'll only get it done about 6 times.
---
Looking perfect. I can take a quick glance and get a somewhat vague sense of where the location is. Thank you for this!
---
Yeah, I just decided to ignore them tbh...I logged out yesterday in fusteration because of Scorch Beasts every where and kept killing me l. found at least 10  
---
F :(
---
Kill squirrel in parade they spawn in big waves 
---
People need to stop fucking whinging.
---
All this chat about masks and drop rates.
---
It’s a fucking computer game.  Get outside and do something.
---
Spend it with your family and friends.
---
That mask your butt hurt about doesn’t matter shit compared to the real world.
---
It really, really does the job! Got mine without even knowing it was a thing. All rise has been in my stash since
---
Just got it if you're interested
---
Its either a skull with a hood. Or not a skull mask.
---
Did you have a workshop? They could have contested iniating PVP across the whole server then fast travelled to you.
---
And no matter how you die you always drop your junk regardless if you're in passive mode. It's been like that since the Beta. 
---
I thought the last patch notes said tamed animals come back after a while
---
If you work in retail , you should know people are assholes. And customers don’t care about your interests or opinions; they just want their latte, dammit ! 
---
I am experiencing this too, the Camden Park dailies not triggering in one of my toons.
---
Thank you for sharing your findings, now I have a couple of things to try when I get home.
---
Did I come across as butt hurt? I was making a suggestion that could save them some grief from those who actually are butt hurt. 
---
Awful for you and your mate.
---
I added you 👍
---
They have mentioned they plan on adjusting it too. I think you're onto it mate.
---
With enough mucking about in GPU settings &amp; the customini it'll definitely go over 60 fps, recent patch seemed to give me a more stable fps as well. 
---
Even if the probability of getting an item was 99/100, you could still play the game until the end of time and never get it. These people need to a) figure out how math works, and b) realize that the word RARE means not everyone will get it. If everyone got every mask, it wouldn't be rare, geniuses.
---
Also love all the cute "research" going on. "I didn't get a rare item after X tries!! Therefore Bethesda is intentionally screwing me!" Grow up.
---
No it was in my personal CAMP. I’m positive that I read somewhere in the notes that if someone kills you without you fighting back at all, you will keep all your items and they won’t get anything out of it but a bounty 
---
Aye, made another post with the rest of them.
---
Mask bros unite!
---
Make sure the game isn't in borderless
---
It varies. Just walk around with the camp deployable thing to get an idea
---
Also not with the alcohol addiction my character developed
---
If that's the case why did you go out of your way to write this lecture in this reddit specifically made to talk about said computer game, Must not have been outside doing something with your family and friends ig :/ 
---
yeah :(
---
And you 100% didn't have possession of any workshops?
---
Nope, that's never been the case. They will get caps equal to your level (If you have that amount of caps) and you'll drop your junk. 
---
If you send it to your camp it becomes a part of the camp, as long as you have the camp-budget for it.
---
The sun one has been seen worn my a few. No jester/devil/skull one yet. 
---
I’ve done it like 30 times never got a berets 
---
Agree 100%. I think the restrictions are so players can’t have an advantage over others- but seriously who cares- let us build. I was so disappointed that I can no longer use the inverted right triangle piece after removing a roof it needs to be built on. It looked fantastic as an underside support for floors and roofs. 
---
And there’s just a million other placement problems that are no fun. I can still build a very complicated structure but I could make it so much better. 
---
No matter how you die you always drop your junk
---
I’m in my garden taking a break from mowing the lawn whilst the kids play on the swing.
---
Because theres a big difference between rare, and unobtainable.
---
You should be able to go through homeowners insurance and get money back to replace what was stolen. You could also check the nearest pawn shop. 
---
Only I didn’t go off on some tangent berating them about something I couldn’t have. 
---
Did you own a workshop, have reactive plates, or a mutation that might have caused damage back?
---
Didn't want to set anything up his behalf but good to know people are interested. If people are trusting enough we can use https://www.paypal.me/coleby If he doesn't want it we can just refund. I'm guessing he's stateside so maybe still asleep!
---
Yes I’m 100% positive, I haven’t used a work shop in over 2 months 
---
Vendor runs aren't really a problem, it's after the run is over. I mean once everyone has gone on a sell run, technically they won't really be profiting much until the following day when vendors reset. As the only source of caps would be from quests, events or looting right? Maybe I'm just over thinking it. 
---
There is very little proof that anyone has received even one mask...
---
Big difference between rare and unobtainable.
---
Honestly, the jukebox tracks are awful. I like the aesthetic of it but I hate the music it plays. It really does need more songs, or different options at least (like how you can select which radio you want to place).

No, you made a suggestion for fake internet points!

The wasteland whisperer perk under charisma. The perk normally pacifies animals, but on rare occasions let's you tame instead.
---
I'm order to tame you need to find an animal spawned from a random event, not tied to a location. It must be half your levels or less, and it must spawn alone.
---
It's really difficult to find them. Random encounters are just that, random. But they do happen at certain locations.
---
[Here's another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a509c9/random_encounter_location_map/) talking about where to find the random events.
---
I know how you feel man, I bought a Vault-Tec  trucker hat I saw at GameStop and was wearing it around on Christmas, visited my neighbors and their son and his nephew started ripping into 76, the hat wasn’t even explicitly for 76.  My brother and I just told them we liked the game and left it at that because it’s Christmas, and I’m here to visit my elderly neighbors who helped raise me, not argue about video games. 
---
Grouping up is too peoply.
---
This deserves so many more upvotes. 
---
Did I? And you made a tacky screen name so you can be edgy. What’s your point?
---
Yeah :( 
---
Still a few days I guess.
---
No to all of those, all I have on my PA is jet pack and Cal shocks
---
Just trying to Burn It Down My Ninja.
---
Someplace that spawns crimson flux so I can finally  get this Biv quest out of my journal!
---
I think you mean ultra rare, rare is more like the beret or some event plans or recipes.
---
Keep an eye out on your local buy/sell/trade pages. If you see your stuff start popping up you can take the police with you to buy it for free. Also, file a police report with as much detail as possible. Every game that was stolen, any serial numbers. That way if you do find it for sale you can reference the report as evidence. 
---
Yeh
---
Lol I wish I would have known that. I guess that means it was my fault then. Oh well. Maybe if another ignorant guy/gal reads this they won’t make my mistake 
---
Personally I've noticed I never get the Camden daily on my level 239 since the last update, but my second character I recently started which is around level 45 gets it. Even when I'm grouping with my friends on their main (they're level 130-180) they don't get the daily while I do when I'm on my second lower level character. 
---
The only reason I disagree with you is because of how little evidence exists of anyone having one of the rare masks.
---
Every photo of the roughly 4 uploaded, has inconsistencies such as not showing its part in the event. (Because people got these masks from raiding a dev room, before being banned).
---
The other striking factor is the market value and the fact that none of the markets have a single post offering one.
---
I believe rare mask owners have a lot of fun ahead on the internet... but where are they?
---
On Pc by any luck?
---
Game is enjoyable. Flawed, but fun. People just tend to jump on hate wagons.
---
The mole miners scale with you. Bring steel to fix the extractors and a high dps gun.
---
You don’t know that you always drop junk on death, and you have 400 weight in bulk junk. What, did you dupe everything months ago and just log back on? 
---
To explain, noone has them.
---
Were you on a team? Like maybe with this guy you were trading with? 
---
If a team member gets into PVP You get sucked into it as well. Even if you're on pacifist mode.
---
So he initiates PVP with his buddy, who is not on your team. His buddy kills you. 
---
I love this idea.
---
i would build something like this but i have my build near rose, lot's of enemies attacking my base sometimes. So i need turrets.
---
Got any Aussies(Oceania players count too) in those ranks?
---
I had a mirelurk hunter for weeks, then when I joined a server where a portion of my camp was nuked it just walked straight into it, I had a snallygaster after that which got killed from ghouls being lead to my house and I was lucky enough to get it back in the next server where it died for no reason. My most recent exciting pet would be an opossum my friend just shot and killed it without even seeing the tag for owned. Hopefully the pacifist fix helps with this.
---
It’s a mask, you won’t even care a day after the event is over. 
---
No, I’ve played at least a hour a day since the game came out. It’s not hard to get junk, I picked everything up
---
If you swarm, are you doing something right?
---
I did drink 50 alcohol, it was relatively easy. Go on farm, get 100razoingrain and corn, take water from river and drink 50 unfermented beers. (With some radaways cause that beer gives you +30 rads haha)
---
But there are some shit like kill bunny, that is hardcore to find bunny, when they have same spawn as 10other creatures mostly spawning retarder deers. But doable. Until some idiot think it will be fun, if you must be under efect of specific alkohol that dont even exist in game. What the fuck?
---
No cause the whole point if 76 is that the scorch plauge is so deadly that only things that are equally deadly can survive it, ie super mutants are so strong the can fighting off the plauge and ghouls are so radioactive and pretty much dead the plauge can't survive inside them.
---
No, if you tame something it's tied to your camp till it dies. When you first tame them, they do have to actually travel back across the map to your camp, and I know they can die during that. I don't know about what happens if you leave the server before they get back. 
---
I’ve seen it happen twice because of a bug I abused where if you leave seconds after it’ll come back but it seems to have been patched out.
---
4 is my least favorite. The radiant quests were awful. Wasn't a fan of the voiced protagonist. There were good parts to it especially Far Harbor, but 76 has given me much more satisfaction. I've embraced the pvp, it's a lot more fun than I expected. And I've gotten big into camp building and crafting on 76 and that's what makes it seem superior. 
---
Meanwhile my sloth froze as it died and no one could loot it.
---
Ps4? 
---
I need shotgun almost! 
---
...But my city is currently experiencing a thunder storm related blackout. I'll keep an eye on the thread if you don't find a buyer
---
Ok 
---
Hey man, this sucks. I'm 24, only 2 years out of college. In August my wife and I bought our first house, and only 3 weeks later I ended up having an emergency surgery and was on disability for 3 months while recovering. I finally made it back to work in December and in January they fired me due to budget cuts. It's been hard. This whole time we have had all of our bills, and only my wife's income and a small amount of unemployment/disability pay. But yesterday I got a new job. This isn't meant to be a humble brag, but just to say health, work, bad luck, it can happen, but it won't stay that way forever. Hoping you get where you want to be. This sucks to say the least. 
---
This not bad, but honestly I would prefer fridge over this, even tho fridge would be inferior to this. 
---
I need a grafton monster thumb mounted on the wall so bad
---
Nope I wasn’t in a team either. But that’s a devious thing you just described 
---
I’m selling multiple ammo you can make a reservation for shotgun shells how many I have 121
---
The 1/10k figure comes from the data mined in the game, not the recorded responses.
---
Maybe you have an awful screen name or an ugly character...
---
I brought an extra protectron. Insult bot found me, so I brought him to the parade. Did not help.
---
Thats a really good idea. I mean what I wrote was just an example but the suggestion you mentioned is more game friendly.
---
Scrapped has 2 P's. 
---
Name checks out
---
The most useless place would probably be the far upper right corner. There’s almost nothing there, and virtually no plants or enemies. 
---
A big quest needs crimson flux? I have just about given up on his quests. Today, for my troubles I received the one recipe I already had and a bottle of leaded champagne... Woohoo.
---
I thought about that.... Might still do it... Will decide when I get there. Bottom lower left corner would still amuse me more though.
---
So how exactly does the event work, I've got two characters, one level 57, one level 22 and not done that event on either so any help you can offer would be amazing
---
No, I am saying that generally the hinting rifle is the best multi-purpose weapon for that build. That most players will prefer the hinting rifle. However, different builds and certain item stats may make other weapons a better choice.
---
A++ build. You're awesome! :) 
---
My biggest issue with the camp system is object/terrain restrictions. TENTS are the perfect example. **We should be able to blend into three ground more easily**. 
---
The new "can't be placed: must be of flat ground" message that pops up for crops is Bethesda being humorous right? Cause it's such a pain in the ass finding a flat spot that doesn't make your crops float. 
---
Also. TENTS.
---
If that was true you would be banned for owning more than 10 stimpacks.
---
Alot of dailys isnt working atm. Not the one i Watoga or the bomb one in the Mire among others 
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks you could farm that in one play session if you needed to and had the stash space.
---
I generally ignore team invites if the person isn't right in front of me. Too many PVP tricks... or just some low level who wants to use me as a fast travel point.
---
You are a hero
---
Getting all the rare masks in one season (week)? Lol, definitely no need to worry about that.
---
 I have done the event close to 50 times, I haven't even seen one rare mask. Each event there are a bunch of participants and I haven't seen anyone else wearing a rare one. The drop rates are so bad you could play this event 24/7 each week its live for 10 years and never see a rare mask.
---
Here's my beef: you came in here and suggested people don't come here. I kind of like it here...even with the negativity. Maybe you should just let this place be what it is and stop advertising another sub.
---
I would like to see Cumberland MD. It's such a beautiful city but with the opioid epidemic, it's not hard to imagine it slightly more run down.
---
Around Charleston station
---
Go north from the Atlas observatory along the train tracks, just past the coal station and train yard to find a little busted up shack. There’s a hunting rifle usually found on a small bench inside. This shack has always had small critters like squirrels and definitely foxes many times as I’ve passed it. 
---
You can share cannabal, wouldn’t waste your points on drug immunity tbh, switching servers or relogging removes addiction
---
The Watoga train vendor shares his cap inventory with all wandering vendors.  Graham, the wandering protectron, and the lemonade stand so far, probably will continue to share with any they add later.
---
*lol* thanks bud
---
He dies after like 5min or could be 15 cant remember
---
Same!!
---
i see the old "draw a bow to move faster while overencumbered" trick from skyrim is still here!
---
Thanks :D
---
Cheers, that's something to consider, thank you!
---
So Cannabal + Philanthropist should be fine, but don't bother with chem immunity. 
---
That's fair- sometimes practical wins out 
---
r/FO76roleplay ! :)
---
Instead of selling the weapons of the enemies you kill scrap'em, then get scrapper perk. Not a farm, just a away to get it as you play.
---
I like to pretend they were all beloved pets that are memorialized there in the lodge as taxidermy heads. 
---
I have to pretend because the alternative is that someone in world hunted a fuckin’ cat and mounted the head as a trophy of their hard won battle. 
---
Any updates about the serial number and stuff?
---
In the event description in patch notes some of the masks are described as "exceedingly rare"-seeing as most people dont know how to understand statistics I think this is an appropriate way for them to suggest the rarity 
---
How much budget do you need? I was planning on taming an opossum, but my CAMP is currently maxed out and I'll need to know how much to delete.
---
If you have fast internet of 50Mbps any game will look great no matter what pc/laptop config. All you need is GeForce Now from NVIDIA. I have used it on an old work laptop and played fo76 with no problems. Here is a link to GeForce Now. 
---
https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/geforce-now/
---
By the way I was also have a similar pc to yours. That has gtx 680 in it instead. FO76 looked good on it and I had no problems playing the game. 
---
One server had that yesterday , flux everywhere and every ghoul dropped a legendary and harpers Ferry had a ton of them too. Was a wierd but awesome morning. But server was buged i think because the tattoo place was closed and so was the fraternity row. And after awhile a message appeared and Said this world is shutting down for maintenance
---
Are you on now??
---
Id second him, scapper definitely helps. Steel is never and issue anymore for me. If you can have a buddy help with some of the super mutants, and have plans to build large generators, you can never go wrong with claiming the grafton steel workshop
---
Because the skisword is uggggggly as hell. God what a dumb weapon. I’ve never even looked at the damage, it’s better than other one handed weapons? Psh I’m unmoved, god what an ugly looking weapon. 
---
I think it is roughly like the Brahmin you can have, 10%. Some say it is a little higher, hard to say without exact numbers.
---
Gotcha. I didn’t see that. I just see a lot of folks complaining on here about it. I did the event maybe 30 times to try and get the realistic stuff like the common masks and plans. I was really happy to get a couple berets. 
---
Thank you. Super helpful 👏🏼
---
Nice! I can see somebody popping open a canned vegetable and trying to go full Popeye on somebody!
---
You just confirmed it.
---
Thank you 
---
I will join that sub when it stops being a non stop cry fest about ‘haters’.
---
Bethesda would like to know your location 
---
That's a good idea!  I assumed we loosely tinned or canned whatever we cooked in order to haul it around the wasteland effectively.  Maybe make the canning bench a secondary crafting bench like the fermenter, which in the case of the canning bench would extend or stop the rate at which food spoils for the cost of a can and some salt.  Maybe food modified that way would weigh slightly more.
---
Are you on now
---
Isn’t there a skybox lit for a camp??
---
Okay, I’ll shoot it down for ya
---
Man, I know what that feels like to come home and find all your stuff missing or trashed. A lot of people have expressed the desire to help out. A lot of us aren’t well off, but can definitely throw in $10-20. I’ll wait for a link from you, just to be safe. 
---
I know it might feel weird to ask for monetary help, when you just posted this for moral support, but most of us feel your pain. If you put up your pay-pal or go fund me or some such, you’ll be able to replace your stuff in no time. I’m really glad that you and your pets weren’t hurt. 
---
I’ll keep an eye on this post. Maybe edit the top content with your link for help, if you decide to do so. Otherwise, good luck to you, and I really hope they catch the SOB’s. 
---
Whoa, do you have pictures? Gotta know if thats true
---
Robots. Kill all robots. 
---
Thank you! A rough estimate is good enough. Looks like I'll have to do a bit of an overhaul to make way for my new friend.
---
Someone else who dislikes that noise. Me too. I almost never use hammers anymore because of it. “Behold the design philosophy of the Super Sledge!” Yeah, it’s not that good, thanks for pointing it out. I do like the new mole miners gauntlet tho...
---
not at the moment. I will be on around 9pm GMT 
---
Much appreciated that link. Thank you. 
---
Being able to scrap them into a large number of edible items and scrap is broken, but otherwise I like it. Make it a permanent item that you can’t scrap (similar to cooked items)
---
Yup! Here’s a tip: The watoga station bot almost always has the plans for sale, for around 250c. Also, I’d need some aluminum to do that, as it costs 25 to make.
---
You need at least 4GB of video memory or you’re going to get the micro lags. May still get it with that. 2x GTX 770 Superclocked cards still couldnt run the game acceptably. I had to upgrade to an 8gb 1070ti. 
---
&gt; You'll also be able to focus your build and squeeze every last inch out of it, and you'll adapt to farming in order to fuel it.
---
Once I started slimming down my weapons/aid/crap I found it's strangely liberating to free up all those perk points used for Traveling Pharmacy, Pack Rat, Batteries Included, and Thru-Hiker.
---
Nuke white springs still gets a fair chunk of exp.
---
drop nukes on whitesprings and  run the farming circle around the area. you should lvl pretty damn quick, I even at 210 leveling quickly doing this when I am bored. 
---
Point #1: why people are angry.
---
Your post reflects you, yourself have made no real attempt to obtain one of the rare masks, but rather read others experiences, so I will explain.
---
Upon your journey you will notice you wont see any one else with one, you will pass thousands of other players. Forget how hard it is to get one yourself. When you see that no one else has one, it raises suspicions.
---
The post providing statistics on the matter is showing that its not a rare item, its a borderline unobtainable item.
---
We are not entitled to be given the masks, but we're also not entitled to have our time wasted chasing an unrealistically improbable goal.
---
The game finally dropped to $15, where I said I'd finally pick it up. I'm definitely having fun with it, but the constant bugs and glitches really bring the experience down. My first 3 star legendary, a radscorpion, first got stuck underground for 15 minutes while it constantly spawned radscorpions. Tried fast traveling away and coming back, and it was walking around again, but attacking it just made it stand still, still invincible, and continue spawning radscorpions.
---
Til
---
Yup PS4 
---
Full on weapon, no, but as a syringer receiver to increase value of the enemy you're fighting, for 3 mins might work.
---
Yes yes it does you on PS4?
---
Post the video, I would like to see this one shot.
---
yeah I won't disagree it may be too rare but they did say as much. And same I've still got a couple decoration plans to get but after that i'm probably done. Really enjoyed the event for how everyone would group up
---
Good to know thanks 
---
OK cool, so nearly anywhere in there. I'll continue my plan of looking at everything. That sounds sarcastic but really, it's good to know that it can be in so many places.
---
I can make those all. Oneeyedcole 
---
I run a power armor build and mess both of the above builds up. It’s all about knowing their particular weaknesses and exploiting them.
---
So it's a dick move, but it would be funny to hear them complain and rage.
---
I need this now
---
I agree, there is a bug with the secondary GPU. 
---
I had an Nvidia Geforce 750 as a physEx processor in my rig when I began having problems. Once I removed the secondary GPU, the problem disappeared. 
---
Try taking the secondary GPU out of your rig completely and I bet your problem will go away. 
---
If you do figure out an .ini modification that works, I would be very interested to see! 
---
Good luck friend. 
---
You are going to get torn up in power armor. 
---
Stealth sniper will be king in survival. 
---
Awesome. How much do you want per serum?
---
Stuff like "do a sneak attack" doesn't register the attack and you just glug vodka for no reason, and then the game eats your legendary armour when you swap it out to see if your chameleon effect is interfering with the attack.  
---
I'm not bitter about that.
---
Sorry bro. Ps4.
---
War never changes.
---
200 a piece. Give me like 15 min. I need to farm some coal for one of them
---
Awesome dude, thank you
---
You needed holotapes to tell you that raiders will always inevitably turn on each other?
---
My friend does this... then tells me to download Apex because it’s “actually a good game”
---
He’s spent hundreds of hours on fallout 4 and almost equally on fallout 3 and New Vegas. He let the YouTube bashing get to him and doesn’t believe it’s great despite knowing I’ve logged in about 150 hours so far lol.
---
Way I see it, his loss! You can guide a horse to water but you can’t make them drink.
---
Wow!   Hero. 😁👍
---
Posting to check back later! I'm 70ish need to get to 90 or so to swap builds.
---
Why the fuck didnt you bring him to a stash and specifically ask what he wanted? Poor move by you.
---
This !! Why the fuck can't the game remember the state in which I leave it? If I turn a switch on or off, it's state is preserved.
---
  I deleted the juke out of frustration, even though I like the asthetic.
---
Yeah, build system is way to restrictive and prevents totally normal aesthetic builds, but  still allows a spiral of staircases leading from one floating shack to another up to a massive floating complex in the sky, so if it’s meant to keep internal consistency it not only fails at its job, but does the exact opposite by preventing totally normal builds from being possible.
---
I built a cabin modeled after my “home away from home” on Far Harbor, and I couldn’t add a storage loft above the bed area for decoration because the floor “needed to be attached to a foundation or stairs” and the flat roof sections “intersected” with the regular angled roof, yet my neighbor has this Flying Fortress of Meta suspenses by a single flight of stairs. 
---
Exactly my thoughts on the game, sure it can be buggy as hell, but for me it’s worth it for how much enjoyment and entertainment I get!
---
Did I say that? Do I need to explain that reducing damage to slaps allows players to, at a minimum, flee situations like this? As the game mechanics are now, if players enter a public event outside of pacifist mode with PvE intentions, with their desired junk in personal inventory instead of a STASH, they've placed themselves in a bad position. If they CAMP near a public event, they've put themselves in a bad position. What happens from that point on is not their "fault." However, they've chosen not to mitigate risks by not using readily available tools. If what happened to OP doesn't sound like fun for other players, they have options to reduce risk.
---
I think this is the best one. The ones close by at the power station are hard to get a tap on because there's usually another mob already attacking them when you get there.
---
Ok that was faster than i thought lol. I have everything i need. You can join my lobby. My gt is oneeyedcole and my camp is south of site alpha
---
"Fuck your opinion, despite your understanding of subjective value!".... - people in this thread. Seriously, as a person who logs on and plays for at least a few hours daily, it's ludicrous to pretend that the bugs in this game (both from launch, and those still existing/new) are prevalent enough to be considered "game breaking" by the general gaming community. Subjectively, fpr me, the game is enjoyable enough, despite its flaws, to continue. But I don't begrudge the nay_sayers. 
---
Pleasure. I was very happy to find that this guy had taken the time to put it together :) 
---
I am on now
---
Giant irradiated spiders....nope.jpeg
---
I get your point. I never tell him to not come to this sub though..We can all have multiple subs at a same time.I believe It'll broaden the chances of meeting new friends and other cool players.  I still uses this sub(most ppl do too), replying to people's posts and sometimes even join their squad. Sorry if I make you feel uncomfortable by posting the other sub and I promise you won't be seeing that again. Have a nice day.
---
If the OP were about accidentally shooting players/camps, your comment would make sense.
---
As its about raiders smashing low levels, commenting about pacifist is rather silly.
---
If you have the time could you link me to your build? I have a heap of 1 star unyielding and picked up a bloodied power fist in a nuke zone 2 nights ago. Currently 15str shotgun build so shouldn't be too tedious to swap.
---
Cook it, add a bunch of salt, and have it dehydrate you.  Should also be able to salt meat and/or make jerky that lasts seemingly forever too
---
I have had some bad days with that thing at 50+. Most days it's a cake walk, but there were times I have force quit the game due to anger at that thing. Once I had every bit of junk on me (was cleaning stash and forgot) and was killed 2x and ended up losing everything.
---
What system are you on ?
---
I remember taking some med-x and rushing her with my death tambourine. 
---
Because like I said, I was ignorant and under the impression that if I was violently murdered without resistance that the murdered would not be able to take any of my junk and they would just be marked with a bounty. 
---
Same... I may need to make new characters but I don’t have as much time lol
---
I don't even know how you'd select songs that aren't in the game currently.
---
I just use Spotify with my ps4 when I want to listen to non fallout music. 
---
I guess i'm too worried about min/maxing. Yeah the ski sword has the highest base 1h damage from what I understand. I believe followed by the machete. I should try enjoying the look of my weapons too, I really enjoy the way the assaultron blade looks it just kills me that the base damage is so noticeably less.  :(
---
They are available as a reward for turning in technical data. After you start the Brotherhood missions you will start seeing the mission to turn in the technical data. You will need to turn in several before getting a plan for BOS paint jobs. My first one was for Initiates and I am now up to Sergeant. 
---
I don't see the issue here. Power Armor is already 1-shot fodder in most cases, at least with this little trick power armor can at least stand on equal footing despite the large cost of resources in comparison to assassin cav/sent armor. 
---
On my way now, thank you
---
West-Tek Research Center
---
Filled with a whole bunch of super mutants in a moderately sized area. Sever hop once you've killed everything. You can also farm caps, gun powder, and it seems to have a higher spawn rate than usual for legendary enemies.
---
I read that immediately as “Blade Beast Queen” and now I’ll never sleep again.
---
Why not use PA yourself? That’s cause I don’t either lol
---
Super mutant areas seem to spawn more than they used to. westtek and Harper's ferry.
---
People are wary of you trying to find their camp locations in order to go to them later to blow them up.  That’s the bottom line.
---
Thanks Eggr! This will spruce the place up :D
---
Level 27, all of my armor is level 20 boiled pocketed leather. No power armor equipped and no legendary/special abilities. 
---
Heck why stop at dogs? Why not go wild? Small pet Radtoads. Maybe a Young Deathclaw. An Eyebot. Theres plenty of cool things we could have as pets
---
Lol. You'd need over 19,000,000 resistance in PA to touch my damage mitigation in mediorce low level 4/5 sentinel.
---
What about tomorrow 
---
A lot of players move them to a second character to store them. Hardly ideal but a workaround.
---
She can't come past the door by the turrets. Get her to follow you to there then just snipe her. She just walks backwards and forwards in front of the door
---
...and is turning Fallout into a possibility every day that goes by. 
---
Just remember that while any animal can be pacified, only randomly spawned creatures that spawn alone can be sent to camp, for example the Opossum that spawn in Flatwoods cannot be sent to camp, because it is not random, but creatures that spawn at the crashed vertibird in the lake north of Abbies's bunker can be tamed as long as they spawn alone because that point is a random spawn point.
---
You can buy them at vendors
---
Someone posted a guide on how to "recruit" different bots. I don't remember how many there were total but it may be worthwhile to check 
---
I have a ghoul slayer, and a zealots ski sword, both come in handy during nuke zones. Ive got several nice trades and caps stashed away for a God roll ski sword. 
---
At the end of the day if you find enjoyment in the game that can't be disputed. 
---
To me the game was a major let down and a cash grab that hurt Bethesda's standing to me. I can view it as a slap in the face and you can have fun playing the game. My point is live and let live. 
---
North of the savage divide. If you're on PC I'll run it with you sometime. 
---
Very very cool design both outside and inside. Though I would say that instead of the benches in front of the Mothman statue, it should be the small pews. More church-like.
---
When combined with Nuka-cola paint t-51 and very defense effective mods like reactive plating, you wont have an issue in pvp fights. While you may believe there is no issue, I certainly believe there is because of the incredible speed and duration stimpaks can end up healing when certain perks are applied, including; First Aid (45% more health regen - duration) and Field Surgeon (Stimpaks nd Radaway will now work much more quickly - speed). With both of these combined, and certain power armor upgrades, you can literally be almost unbeatable if you spam like 15-20 stimpaks before you start a fight. I appreciate your feedback nonetheless.
---
Or add ballistic weave. 
---
"My trio and I"
---
Well, the problem here is why would someone sneak around if they can just face-tank the turrets no problem? Only if they are very dangerous would sneaking around really be a problem imho.
---
Sweet camp btw
---
I'm not a power armor build XD, making one right now though :)
---
Thanks!!
---
Cattlepolt
---
It's really nice, I love the third claw mod.  I'm tempted to eventually switch some perks out to use fists/ unarmed instead of 1h. 
---

Could you elaborate on why the mole miner is way inferior?  I'm searching reddit history for information but can't really find why the mole miner is worse.  From what I can tell it looks like it has same damage as deathclaw when they both have extra blade mods on.  What am I missing? 
---
On that hustle lol
---
Server hop the penitentiary up north. There are 9 sets of can chimes. Each on give you 9 cans. Each can gives you 2 steel. Do the math. ;)
---
If you're cool with holding workshops (PvP risk)
---
Grab hemlock holes (3 acid nodes = 60 acid per/h)
---
Then hit hornwright test site #3. need to make a new video (someone showed me ~20 nodes I didn't know about), but there's like 40+ iron ore nodes around. In excavator PA you get 4x for each grab.
---
If not, mothman museum spawns low level scorched. With the scrapper perk its a ridic amount of steel. 
---
Can also get mothman eggs (cook em and sell em to vendors) for capping out quickly.
---
This, I haven't fought a PA wearer that I didn't one-shot.
---
Thanks 
---
That's amazing, used those ivory keys to drown out those extractors.
---
I feel you. I’ve lost two mega sloths. I agree that sometimes it doesnt feel worth it, generally the creatures you can actually tame are effectively useless as camp guards unless you live in the Forest- my level 20 sloth was no match for the stuff that spawned around my camp in the Mire.
---
Anyone knows the name of that song by the way ?
---
Thanks I keep getting dropped I'll get melee
---
I'd donate to that. 
---
Does paint add DR or something?
---
Ah, okay! Thank you! I'll just keep the perk card on hold and I can always switch to it if I find an eligible opossum.
---
You are not kidding. The players make this game what it is.
---
Made from imitation Megasloth teeth.
---
Why would it be a shame? We are getting all DLC for free! 
---
 Lmao. We all downvoted you out of free opinion. 
---
Yup.  Report back with results please.  
---
CANNED FASNACHT DONUTS FTW
---
Pacifist reduces the player's incoming damage to "slap" damage, so long as the player doesn't engage. Therefore, retreat is an option. 
---
If you're going into a high-traffic area, (nuked areas, limited-time events) there will be more players, and you are therefore more likely to encounter a wanted/unwanted PvP encounter. Knowing this, if your intent is NOT to PvP in the area, enabling Pacifist mode first will give you time to flee, swap servers, etc., unless you choose to engage them (thereby negating Pacifist mode.)
---
I've completed this quest for 100+ times...haven't get a single rate mask yet :'(
---
False, all I'd need to do is put on the power armor perk that staggers you when I ram into you (while you keep shooting me and see my health regenerate at an insane pace), or shoot you with a shotgun for a 30% chance of stagger and switch to my main weapon. Or I can use a gamma gun and kill you with radiation. All the while, as stated before, my 15-20 stimpaks regeneration rates are making me nearly invulnerable. 
---
Nope. Pacifist stops you from damaging them.
---
Does nothing to mitigate incoming damage.
---
Sitting in Whitesprings b/c no one nukes anywhere else except where the Queen comes out. BORING.

Hail brother! Outstanding work, now we need to ask Bethesda if we can actually ride Vertibirds again and see if we can make that ship of yours moveable.

#themoreyouknow
---
yes, by a solid 40 points per piece.
---
Thats right. Dont let people fool you. Experience the Game *together*!
---
That’s been there the whole time.  Not sure why that and the mouth harp can’t be built for CAMP or how they saw to leave out a musical jug. 
---
AFAIK, they've actually added this for Survival mode - restrict the amount of Stimpacks you can use back-to-back.
---
I suppose I should respond to you because you need verification that you are someone. I have done that. So you can continue breathing now.
---
So childish robots and people running around in animal costumes or with silly fasnacht masks is all you wanted from a post apocalyptic shooter? Maybe you did not want a post-apocalyptic shooter in the first place.
---
I like playing F76, but its not in the same ball park as Fallout 4. Not even close. I had some of my best moments in a game ever with Fallout 4. The moment when you leave some building with Valentine just to watch the BoS airship floating over you and Valentine citing something out of a book is just epic stuff. Never had those moments in Fallout 76. Never.
---
It's a feature!
---
U really ran it 100+? 
---
I said they'd do this at launch. Got downvoted to hell. 
---
Humans in general are dumb as shit.  The world would be better off without us.
---
That is fantastic lol! Probably won't, but I hope they add it for this current mode.
---
I’ve been saving my maps....  Time to go a-huntin!
---
Mmkay, I have a bunch
---
Only had one other player &amp; we got through with all robots, still a common mask :(
---
Lol. I hit hard enough to kill in 1-2 shots. Your stimpacks are meaningless. 
---
If youre on pc and you'd like to test your theory, ill be on in ~2 hours. Same ign.
---
Fucking assholes not liking the things I want them too! 
---
I used to do the monster mash event from like lv. 50-80. I did it to farm plans but by defeating all the ghouls you also get a lot of caps and meds, which I then sold for more caps. 
---
I saw your the data mine.
---
Looks amazing! 
---
All I have to do is get your health to 0. If I can do that even if you're at max health, no amount of healing will help you. 
---
Were you running a bloodied build and sitting there with low health? 5 dmg/sec from 2x people can add up quick. BTW when talking about pvp, saying you were wearing power armor, is like saying you were naked.
---
Yeah, he’s a level 107. The enemies were 68. I think you just misread the post. 
---
It wont, you will be wasting your time if you are trying to get trophies. your best bet is to make a new character and do everything without going near the school
---
One ran up to me while I was building my new CAMP. It kept repeating the same shit over and over while I was trying to build, I got annoyed, and I killed it. No regrets
---
What system?
---
Great idea. Not as glamorous as making your own brew, but I’d like it.
---
Sry for your loss, I hope your able to recoup some of it and I hope the person who stole from you gets punished. On another note the one good thing from this , is at least you or your wife wasn't there when it happened and that nothing happened to you guys , as in either of you getting hurt 
---
Im all for it. 
---
To me this sounds like the logical next step in our ability to be self sufficient. Refigerators to preserve food longer are nice but if we want to provide a steady amount of food for future generations we need to be able to make things that will last longer than a few days in the form of canned food.
---
Its also another step towards complete self sufficience.
---
I only believe its not an issue because power armor has its counters. Reactive doesn't matter, melee has sentinel and power attack damage mitigation to stop that, melee pvp people should know this. People can one-shot you with Guass Rifle/Dragoon Vat's Crit's so its kinda whatever. 
---
Honestly the guy spamming stimpacks to stay alive is no different then the guy spamming stealth boys or Quantum's. There's a risk/reward system sort of. The willing to spend the dough usually end up with the win. 
---
At least power-armor is viable against a wide variety of damage types (everything excluding one-shot builds). 
---
Here's some small advice to help kill a power armor user though. Cryonades drain all your AP instantly if you use the dodgy perk. Since most power armor users use Quantums and Dodgy to stay alive, consider throwing one of them before putting down some heat. Cryonades in general are really good. 
---
I learned to do canning as a kid growing up on a farm on the summers with my grandparents.
---
Canning does not require preservatives, the process of canning brings the contents up to the boiling point in a pressure cooker and thus kills off any offending bacteria.
---
We canned fruits and vegetables, salsa, marinara, soups (without noodles), and even alcohol. We would also make Cordial with apples, pears, raspberries and cherries from the the farm and potato vodka that grandpa distilled.
---
I hear ya, what do we consider the 5 rare masks?  I am just asking to get a gauge as to what is what.
---
It’s junk.  You will get it back quickly.  I throw everything away other than ballistic fiber, aluminum, screws and springs at this point.  
---
It's not a bug. 
---
Not a bug.
---
didn't know tht, appreciate the information
---
Was that a typo, like did you mean 121k? I'd buy 121k.
---
Not a bug. 
---
Which ones are the rare ones? Only done three times so far
---
Hey man I’ll be on later today 
---
No 121
---
That’s all I got at the moment I have energy ammo if you want that
---
ok I'll add you. I'll send you a FR shortly. My ign is Daraxyn
---
whenever I kill it the body shows but I can’t loot it
---
I'll join if I can. The world is full. 
---
What do you mean by legacy weapons? Did they change something?
---
I've got a few max level legendary ones from launch.
---
id like to see a source on this. 
---
X box1
---
Bummer PC here
---
I hope your day goes well too. I just explained my beef 
---
Well, you neutralize the argument with "assuming similar perks and legendary effects."
---
I realize that everyone and their uncle seems to buy the perfect weapon in an online marketplace, but if you're finding them yourself, you don't really get a say in what you get.  It's entirely possible that you'll get some 3\* Assaultron Blade that is far better than a Ski Sword.
---
Me?  It was dinky knives.
---
Oh ok
---
No, i got the point perfectly, my point wasn't about the 0.2% anyway.. it's about people dictating to others what they should or shouldn't say or do.
---
that prevents you from being able to deal damage to or kill other players. 
---
Hmm legendary variants of the gun perhaps?
---
So yeah they do come in legendaries.
---
i request video footage of the outcome. 
---
Future DLC: Biv is lonely and needs a drinking budd, build a Bev. 
---
Turn it off and watch how much damage happens
---
*its exactly the same*
---
replying to a one day survey with less than a thousand samples. It's not a valid survey. 
---
When you can get in, I don't mind endlessly killing robots in the nuke silos. With a suit of trouble shooters gear the only issue is when you hit a couple gutsys at the same time. But it's endless spawns 
---
I'd like to hope the prestige system upcoming allows us to equip more perks somehow.
---
The Gauss is heavy. The ammo is 0.1 lb each, the heaviest of all ammo, excluding explosives and cores. It charges slow. It has a very low magazine capacity. 
---
This ammo would have no weight. Would cost 0 resources. Would do similar damage without the need to charge the shot. It also has the benefit of having recoverable ammo on top. 
---
They fixed the foundation stacking....I am a little upset about that. 
---
For low levels, farm outside V76
---
Have you actually relogged? I went over that at 25 and some turrets and robots were alive in there but the assaultron wasn't. Could totally be wrong, but I'm not sure it always spawns.
---
I really does.  I find the soldier mask to be a pretty good fit, too.
---
Yes , I have 20 sets of each 5 common masks. 
---
and I give up...
---
Sure I’ll do that later today
---
Well, you simply say, not a bug, well what's the reason why then? I'd like to know why its "not a bug", honestly.
---
The list does include the cryptids. :)

Sure, add me and I can show you. IGN: Daraxyn 
---
I've seen you comment "not a bug" a few times now, but you haven't given any sort of supporting evidence as to why you are saying this
---
No, you misunderstand.  I don't care if people don't like something, but if somebody publicly shows their support for something they shouldn't be berated neither should that thing they like.
---
That's the issue both I and the O.P have.
---
My guess is this was because of their lazy coding. Instead of making it visible to only the user, it creates a cloud around everyone that everyone can see. 
---
In a single player game, this would be ok, as there's only one player to see the effect, but....  
---
That's real sad, I hope the police find them, And your belongings are Return.
---
I think I got mine from Grahm
---
Yeah, I have one. It's from Savage Divide, White Powder Jumpsuit or so I believe it's called
---
Curios, OP - why did you create this thread? 
---
You said you don’t post here, so I’m ruling out stopping by to let everyone know your FO76 arrival will be delayed. 
---
I’ll let you answer before I continue, or draw conclusions.
---
Seconded
---
Bethesda is stupid and the piece of apparel takes up all armor slots. Just bad game design. Stuff like this has been in fallout games since the original. 
---
I’ve seen three other posts saying the same, either from disconnect or fast travel.
---
I personally lost a 3* lvl35 TSE handmade
---
There is 100% a big rn where you can lose your equipped weapon.
---
No, I only tried it during one play session - died about 8 times before I gave up. I guess someone had been through right before me and killed everything inside except her. 
---
I like the idea of double caps, why? Because it's huge risk and reward, which is what makes a game fun. The pve aspect of the game is pretty much dead for me. 
---
I've been playing since the beta and have done everything so what i currently do is look for pvp at workshops, and tbh, more often than not it pays off. 
---
I think the idea of double caps will make people spend more time on they're pvp build in the pve servers so that when they come into it they will be ready for it which is what a small minority of the community has been doing already. It's become the only fun part of the game. So in conclusion, if you don't think your ready for the double cap lose or gain then spend more time on your build/armour and join us when your ready
---
Please update later with his response if he doesn’t post it here.  
---
There's a joker, sun, devil, and others too that they advertised and the protectrons are wearing them
---
I'm not sure I know where that is - I might need to explore a bit more. I did this quest on a previous character....snuck in right behind someone much higher level than me and let them take care of everything. :) 
---
Good luck hopefully the RNG gods are on your side.
---
Good to know, thank you im giving up now too
---
Yeah I just want higher cap cause I can’t upgrade any of my intelligence perks 
---
Because that's the modern society we live in, I'm sorry to report.  It's not enough to simply dislike something.  You have to go on a blind, holy crusade against anyone who dares to like it, even if you have no idea what you're actually talking about.
---
I'm on PC. I have the Black Diamond Ski Sword and the Blade of Baset. Might try those. One of my mutations gives a plus to melee. 
---
Poor Craig.  I also had a tamed mega sloth, and her name was Carla.  I miss her so much and I can't bring myself to get another pet.  
---
I have never pvp before lol, but I had full health and I’m a “normal” melee build. I don’t use mutations or any of the bloodied stuff. Just 3 maxed out slugger perks, X01 PA and a AA super sledge. This guy hit me with a deathclaw gauntlet it looked like and one shot me. I’m also missing 5k 5.56mm rounds too but I figured that was a glitch 
---
The reason the survey was created, is very valid. Because no one is claiming ownership or sighting them in game.
---
- None have been posted for sale.
---
- The screenshots are fairly inconsistent and theres nothing that ties to them to the event.
---
- I and everyone else actively looking are not sighting anyone with, or receiving any ourselves, while passing hundreds, perhaps thousands of other players searching.
---
- And for a 7 day event, one day is fairly substantial. Not even considering that theres only 3 days of the event left.
---
And if you think we're complaining about nothing, how about you grab a screenshot at the event with one of the rare masks.
---
Interesting, so fatman and gatling probably have similar IDs and the system can’t tell which is which. They should really implement a local object ID specific to individual users so each item can be properly identified. This is a real mess now. 
---
One of the best mods for FO4 was the place anyway mod. I really wish this game adopted that approach or at least was closer to allowing us to place stuff as freely as possible.
---
Look, I've literally given you documented proof. Your experience in pacifist mode, and mine, do not align. I've taken multiple hits from bloodied 1-shot builds while rocking zero damage mitigation perks and an endurance of 1 without issue. I'm not going to argue with your opinion/bias. Good luck in the wasteland, yeah?
---
I don't think MAGA hats apply because, if you live in the US... and some might say the world in general... then you've already had 2 years of "trying" Trump whether you liked it or not.
---
I know I could, it was just the last straw. I even stuck through when someone force traded me and took my TSE 50 cal. But this was just plain annoying. And confusing. 
---
Yeah they can build it but they can't edit it cuz they aren't the owner. You can move, edit, store it, etc.
---
Yeah, it's really short, it's really hard to fail on purpose
---
Once you hit 60/70 the quests dry up. I'm 78 and have done every major quest and am just doing dailies at this point(which bounce you around the map with no major rewards besides a bit of xp)
---
Does anyone know what mask/s is the rare mask? Some may have it and not even know it...
---
This.  
---
Cool thanks buddy. 
---
I only name my Brahmin. Gertrude gives everyone more milk than me. That bitch....
---
Yeah, I think (maybe very wrong) that the Assaultron may spawn if you're doing the Enclave quest there but maybe not for the MoM quest. 
---
No problem!! I had just built a power armor crafting station for my brother (he didn't have the plans) and he was able to move it. When he packed up camp it stored it and even though it had a padlock icon on it in the menu he was still able to place the one in storage down. So you should be good as long as you don't scrap what they build, lol.
---
That’s my personal nemesis. I’m sure I don’t need to carry 100 purified water around, and yet I pick every one I find, on top of harvesting my own purifiers. Same with screws: I’ve already built all PA sets, I don’t need to keep farming, but I can’t stop. 
---
Springs, thought. An explosives build never seems to have enough of those. 
---
Maybe comparing guns to shooting schools isn't the best analogy?
---
So.. If i got int. Max lvl, and i have hackers perk 1,i cant get the next lvl? 
---
I want to make a new character but I feel like new characters would have a disadvantage 
---
Douche waffle is at again...
---
Fallout 4 is the worst fallout game for me. That game is the reason I don't want human npcs in 76.
---
Yeah, if something like this happens IRL and I don’t like the person or am in a shitty mood I will tell them “wait, you haven’t even played it?  Lol one day you will learn to think for yourself”.  
---
😜😉
---
Daggum, you're gonna clean up shop when player vending drops and people who weren't around for Fasnacht want a mask, lol... that's what I'm gonna do with extras, at least. :P
---
This.
---
"Innocent"
---
As far as I'm concerned all those bots are part of the Enclave.
---
No pleasing the mind of goldfish... 
---
I’m still wondering why all the ‘90% reduced weight’ Legendaries still weight a ton lmao. Come on Bethesda hire someone with high school math skills to do the calculations for you 😂 
---
I love to kill people who have hundreds of pounds of bulk on them. I hate grinding for specific components. 
---
:'(
---
This!  Whenever it happens to me, I just like to savor the irony that their attitude perfectly captures the mindless tribalism that is the backdrop for WW3 and fallout 1-76
---
Next time just shake your head and say, "War.  War never changes."  If they're just joking with you, they'll laugh.  If not... well.. it never changes, does it?
---
To begin with dont make tameable creatures so rare. Second let them properly name them and third let them be respawnable at our camp.
---
I have a two shot and anti-armor varieties.
---
Many one star bloodied weapons are more powerful than fancy three star non-bloodied counterparts. I’d prioritize Bloodied then look at the stars. 
---
Hey OP, it’s alright, no one got hurt, thats the most important part, sooner or later, I am certain you will comeback, and we eager for your return
---
Good Luck OP :)
---
Yeah that is why I made this post the dailies might not be broken, but the way to trigger them is just misplaced somewhere else on the map region, like watoga trigger may be somewhere else in the same region.
---
If they took all the weapons from Fallout 3 and New Vegas and remade them for 76 this game would be much better for it. Totally dreaming though.
---
There's a mod for FO4 that combines the NCR service rifle, the assault carbine, and the marksman carbine along with M16/M4 parts and its absolutely amazing. If Bethesda came anywhere close to that mod I'd cream my khakis. 
---
Go to  Harpers Ferry first kill the super mutants and take there guns they should get you all the caps in 2 maybe 3 shops when you run out of guns to sell go to the vendor near top of the world kill and loot all the enemy around there and sell there guns or go white springs and pick the flowers and sell them most shops have atleast 30 caps worth of junk very close by aswell. it takes about 2 mins to loot the area and enemys around them shops. 
---
also get a full unyielding set if you aint got one yet at low hp this will add 15 charisma for better prices.
---
i have some unyielding i dont want if you need 
---
Its the door right next to the turret. You can back up, snipe her, and when she is charging up just go around the edge of the door. 
---
Yesterday I was at my camp harvesting and a guy came up asking if he could use my workbenches. I told him sure. Before leaving he asked "you need anything. Anything at all?" He was a pretty high level so I said "what are you? Some kinda genie? Anything I want and you'll just give it to me?" 
---
"Hell yeah man I got a lot of shit I'm not using what you want?"
---
I had been farming assualtrons all day cause I really wanted the assualtron helmet. So I just flat out said that's what I wanted. He walked to my stash box. A paper bag appeared. And now I have a cool helemet I keep getting lots of compliments, questions, and emotes towards and about. I love the social interaction and community.
---
I bought it, definitely was not blown away by it's performance 
---
Joker,Sun,Devil,Skull,and Old man winter
---
Probably not since the one we have is a FO4 asset.
---
Reasoning is valid, but the process is wrong. Needs multiple days, more subjects, had it been a full 24 hour survey I might feel differently, but it's also only counting the player base on reddit. I would suggest also posting it to the bethesda forums. 
---
Quit being bitchy about it. I am  stating the survey needs to be adjusted for an accurate representation of the drop rate. If you're using shit statistics your argument is shit.
---
Don’t listen to him. His account proves he just hater bitch that just trolls everyone because he is a Petulant fucking child.
---
I would happily pay atoms for that. Most things in the shop are very reasonable amounts either way, and I have gotten most things I really wanted by simply earning them.
---
Really wish we had those cause the ones we get are just way too big.
---
While we're at it I wish we could just build farm plots like we see around Flatwoods and such, so there's always a flat area to plant our crops. The ones from FO4 were okay but not flat enough to look okay with things like Mutfruit trees or Razorgrain.
---
Haven't played 76 in a bit, it had a bench for scrapping junk right. 4 really needs that
---
Lol, I’m not sure if this was a pun, but I hope so.
---
Ooo nice 👍
---
At least those are weeklies.  I don't mind if the weeklies are more of a challenge (though they've also gotten way more involved recently).  But the dailies - I used to try logging in most days to try to tick off at least 3 even if I didn't have much time to play.  Now even with a long play session I'm only accomplishing 1 or 2.
---
I was thinking about this.  One of the big incentives for killing people on Survival will be the double caps payout.  Now, lets say you run across a level 20 with your level 155.  You might think "easy caps".  And you'd be right, however they can slap a bounty on you for killing them.  So now, you're likely one of the only players visible on the map for a period of time, and every survival player looking for something to do is going to come after you.  Might not be worth it for 40 caps.  
---
No my camp is full enough
---
I am responding to you keeping your first comment in mind.
---
If you read my response I haven't referenced the statistics once. This is all my own experience.
---
Sorry if that bothers you.
---
I’ll dontate 20 as well. 
---
Post that link
---
I think the mobs are capped so low levels can participate too. I would Imagine there are going to be events down the line with higher and more difficult enemies. 
---
Yeah it’s definitely not necessary.
---
I think one of the vaults will have humans inside
---
I really love both (and FO3 and NV), but Fallout 4 is my favorite.  I miss the NPC dialogue, making choices that matter,  and having settlers working at your base. it's also not the same without companions.  It is fun to play with real people sometimes, but when I am doing errands in the game like farming caps or trying to find a certain type of junk, I can't do any of that playing with others.  It would be nice to have a Dogmeat, Nick Valentine, Piper to travel with.  One thing I do not miss however, is Preston Garvey.
---
Thank you, fingers crossed 🤞 lol
---
Alright I’ll dm you a link!
---
I noticed the "leader of the pack" event in the forest had a couple legendary wolves that gave me lvl 1-5 legendaries. I only ran it once or twice so I don't have an idea of how often they are legendary.
---
Leader of the Pack event in the forest.
---
March 26
---
Are you using any mods?
---
Wow! You actually think I would want to respond to claptrap like this? That's just funny.
---
Anyone else see the fan in the first house and instinctively move to collect it?
---
We have a great Xbox community there I’ll dm you a link 👍
---
That would be dope! I may have to take ya up on that later today! I can probably pay out caps or trade ammo or supplies for some.
---
🐑💩
---
Definitely a keeper lol
---
600 caps / 4 charisma
---
This post confuses me, as I never have this issue. Some things I do:
---
  I make my own boiled water from dirty water picked up or grabbed from streams, sinks in houses, hand pumps in many areas, then use it to make soups and teas.  Soups preferred as they sate hunger and thirst.   make meat from off kills.   Cooking stations everywhere, including many train stations or grab workshop and put one down. 
---
I do these things as I go along doing other stuff in the game, and I guess it’s second nature now.
---
 I have a camp with purifiers now, but I usually just sell that to vendors for quick caps. 
---
I estimate that I spend about 5 mins every few hours on cooking.

I hope this helps!
---
They're always legendary for that event. 
---
Rewards are levels 1-15.
---
Wow. 6000? You weren't kidding😂. Guess I'll need quite a bit more. I'll keep that location in mind. Thanks for the tip! I didn't even know those existed
---
If I need a good amount of steel real quick, I go to the Whitesprings and collect hangers from the two clothing shops. With the Scrapper perk, two or three server hops will get me \~150 steel.
---
I’m sorry to hear this. I hope to see you back in the wasteland soon!
---
Yes and phantom pa as well
---
I saw it once.  I assumed another player had mistakenly entered one of the power armor chassis then dropped the chassis.  And then the first respawned eventually when I or another player entered the area.  
---
I'm on XB1 :/
---
We have a few Europe players so I believe your guys timezones match up a little better then the rest of us Canadian/American players 👍 I’ll dm you a link. 
---
I'd rather see some sort of "turn in" option at the end of events like this.  Something like "turn in x amount of full mask sets for a random uncommon/rare/super rare mask".  This would give the heavy grinders an extra chance at the rare masks, and have the side benefit of making the common masks a little less common.  
---
That is one viable outcome to be sure, however I have tons of Faith in the creativity and panache of the Community to have a real Go at this Sandbox we bought. :)
---
depends if I can get rid of the kids haha 
---
I've seen several people use the fat man in the event and if the suiciders dont explode and you didnt kill them they usually drop nukes anyway so i go around collecting nukes for people who use them
---
It’s the facts. Face it or hide from it it’s the truth.
---
I'm sure he was harshly berated and then promptly burned at a stake.
---
Have you guys ever worn a football jersey before? Jesus Christ. 
---
One issue first: platform?  I'm Xbox 
---
You have to make the doc public for us to see it ;) 
---
Grahm sells them and they can also be awarded for workshop claim/defense.
---
I don't have any spare plans but if he's  on PlayStation I'd gladly come build him some pink flamingos.
---
I will accept random invites, but don’t usually know where the other person is or what they’re doing. Without knowing they’re doing an event I’m not going to ft to their location. I figure most random requests are people looking for a free ft. 
---
Add me if u want. VinKramey
---
They aren't really that great anymore but look on xbox marketplace they sell them there all the time.
---
I just don’t understand why you keep wanting to put CND drain it. It’s canned. If stored properly it will last for forever. Pork n Beans and Dog food are in Fallout 4 an additional 185 years into the future and holding up just fine. I’m tired of CND food when I scavenge around or cook up some tasty wasteland creature meat and then go on my merry way of slaughtering the scorched by the hundreds with no mercy to see that I have became starved and when I bring up my pipboy to see my food I just cooked is already spoiled.
---
I eat it anyways. No dignity 
---
Bugger, never shared a doc before :p
---
Ok thanks man 
---
you also cant craft atomic shop items in other peoples camps 
---
My Sniper's backstory is that she is Obliquity Jones Great Grandmother to Eulogy.
---
I'll let you know how that turns out :)
---
You’re right, but the original and the one based in Helvetia are actually a little bit different because of their Swiss roots in Helvetia, But yeah it is definitely extremely similarly to Mardi Gras now that you mentioned it.
---
to*
---
No I haven't lol
---
Give it a day to mentally recover.   Hopefully most of the assholes will head over to Survival mode next week. 
---
Be prepared to blow yourself up a million times especially if your doing a silo run.
---
Think I've done it would you be so kind as to check?
---
I got mine from workshop quests.
---
I'm 23, and got 3 semesters left after being there for 5 years. Majoring in electrical engineering with minors in math, computer science, and music performance. My wife had to quit her job for about 8 months due to all the health issues she was having. She's back to work, but can't work 8 hr shifts any more, and at retail pay that doesn't make much. I did get an internship for the summer that I'm looking forward to, and pays much better than retail. It's a bit further away, so I'll have to worry about my wife, but even with the cost of an extra room at someone's place out there I'll still be making way more than what I was, and where it's school related I'll be able to take a leave of absence from work, and they can't fire me cause there's a union. But I can completely understand the bills keep coming with no way to pay them all. We racked up some debt in that time and will be working on it for some time, hoping to knock out a lot of it this summer. 
---
But congrats on your new job, I hope it goes well. I know how much a job can turn things around. And i didn't read it as a humble brag. And thank you for your kind words.
---
They come in legendary yes. I got two shot as well
---
I don't get it either. I was sceptical at first but really enjoy it now. 
---
Yeah I’m just looking for something different,I’ve been a melee build my entire play through,I’m now lvl111
---
I’m sorry you’re going through that - a burglary of a house is an intensely personal crime to experience. A lot of people are shocked at how violated they feel (I’m a retired cop, California prison teacher, and licensed PI.) If you choose to get an alarm system (a lot of people do after) don’t sign any long-term security monitoring contracts with one of those big alarm companies. There are online wireless burglary alarm kits that are cheap and you can put in if you you want an alarm.
---
If you are in California (or a heads-up for any players in my former state of CA) the political tide there is focused on releasing as many prisoners as possible... especially for crimes considered non-violent (like this). Because of that, it’s rare for DA’s to file charges against suspects even if caught. If caught they’ll probably receive a fine they won’t pay, sit in a county jail (not prison) for a few days (if any), then get released. There’s no reason for a burglar to stop - the current focus is on releasing inmates not making more. Plus the state wants crime statistics to drop and filing charges against someone creates a crime stat, so if no one was hurt it rarely happens. (While the number of home burglaries is increasing, politicians can point at stats and say crime is getting lower - at least for now.) As you might figure, it can be hard to get a police department motivated to hunt down suspects that will ultimately end up being released and go right back to burglarizing homes.
---
The best thing everyone can do is make sure you have your contents insured (homeowner or renter’s insurance) and file a claim after to replace your stuff. Always lock your doors and get good locks - most burglaries of crimes of opportunity. I hope you get your stuff back, but in the end it’s just stuff... we lost our home years ago in the Cedar Fire, and when all was said and done, most stuff is replaceable. The best thing I was glad to read is your pets weren’t hurt since they tend to be family and irreplaceable. Sorry for droning on so long... crime is a pet peeve so I can get a little long-winded.
---
It also works for fall damage
---
Same! I build a lovely house in a lovely spot w a nice view and lots of plants near by and I can't ever move! Haha
---
My husband plays on my other character which has a little camp that moves around a ton.
---
If you take over Charleston Landfill and defend it a few times it will drop. I have had the plans for them drop at least 6 times there. 
---
How do you tame a creature? Pacify?
---
All the way at the end of the glassed cavern, around where the high level scorchbeast spawns from the fissure, if you hug the left path (the room is a rough circle), you will first find a power armor corpse on a scaffolding.  If you continue straight from that position there will be rock with another bunch of monster corpses on it like scorchbeasts and mirelurks. On top of that little hill is Paladin Taggerty, next to a transmission dish. It's on your right as you approach the short tunnel that leads to the one-way cave exit. She will have in her container-type loot inventory a random collection of 1-3 pieces of brotherhood of steel combat armor (of all varieties, heavy, sturdy, light), a holotape, and a BOS soldier underarmor.  Her inventory resets once every 20 hours or so and server hopping will randomize her loot. But once you take it it's empty until almost a full day.
---
You did it! :)
---
Just think of it this way, there is an asshole that does that type of stuff BUT I’d imagine assholes in the wasteland, that would actually do that for attention or their own kicks. It’s really no big deal and makes this game actually have consequences 
---
"teenage guys" &lt;-- found the problem right there.
---
Thanks!
---
Anyone else on PC experiencing a new bug where if they log into the game after disconnecting in their CAMP, you have to _sprint_ away out of the CAMP and out of the nearby area before the CAMP finishes spawning or else get "Server has stopped responding" and Server Disconnected?
---
Because for me, that's life post-patch.  Not certain if patch-related, but started soon after.  I'm posting now after having tried four times to get in and gotten bumped every time. Worse yet, when it disconnects in this way, the FO76 client freezes if you try starting again and takes about a minute to kill off the process in Task Manager.
---
Yeah I just want a higher lvl max like 20 25 at most 
---
Do you have unyielding sentinel left arm or assasin sentinel
---
The red rocket megasign works
---
Thanks so much! this finally worked for me. Used melee and went to Watoga.
---
Hail! Thank you! Yeah, we need zeppelins. 🤔😃
---
I've gone ahead and started over so the new character gets some Fasnacht stuff before going over to Survival.  I've been wanting to start over for a long time and I was sure that survival wasn't going to allow transplanting.  That's why I've waited so long.  
---
My main is level 91 and I've played since day 1 BETA. I've made a lot of uninformed choices in that character build because of lack of planning, balance changes, and ignorance.  It was also never built for pvp.
---
Im really looking forward to survival, but TSE is still a bit too common and it worries me.  I've been destroyed at workshops multiple times and barely have the time to get a shot off. 
---
You don’t even have to go into that room. Just head up to the room on the left side overlooking the room with the assaultron and snipe away. I believe I was around level 20 when I did it and had no issue. She can still attack you with her laser beam but just move away from the window and you won’t get hit.
---
looking for transparent pngs of this stuff
---
Where you not in passive mode?
---
It's not a bug, otherwise it would have been addressed in the patch updates. I've had the rags since December, and they have always taken up all slots, and removed equipped armor, as with the hazmat suite, etc.
---
Now, I agree with OP, it shouldn't be this way, but I'm not sure why all the people are down voting people who say it isn't a bug... Do you always disagree with unpopular facts?
---
Yet you hop into XO-1.. traitor
---
Yeah 😂
---
Omg that’s dedication, I’ve only done it 28 times but last night I was dreaming about marching robots and the music which I loved on the first run is now driving me a little crazy lol
---
You are a decent, reasonable person trying to understand how a drugged-up felon thinks. They’re looking for stuff they can easily carry and sell quick for some dope for that day. They are rarely long-term planners.
---
Thanks I thought about it for awhile, I had to write it down because I forget things really easily and don’t often post ideas.
---
I’m thinking around the mid morning time that updates and such usually happen.  What is it, 10am est or so?
---
I thought those force trade stuff on reddit was lies?
---
Agreed. Its really easy to get bored on FO76 when your high level.
---
I would love to see some new guns. I cant imagine it would be hard to use some FO4 gun data on FO76 considering it's exactly the same engine. 
---
'Danse Macabre in G minor' 
---
went there, and all i find are "strangler pods"  not "strangler bloom".  do they come out at a specific time?
---
I love that people are setting up shops too. Add me Alteron_command I'm at whitesprings next to the station. 
---
I will add you and visit :) 
---
Came across two yau guai battling a giant sloth yesterday. Tried to save the sloth, dispatched both bears. As I was inspecting the aftermath I noticed two dead baby giant sloth nearby. Made me sad.
---
The only thing that I'm worried about going into survival isn't the TSE weapons it's the fact players can see the top 3 alive players on the map. 
---
I have BOS t60 too 😁😂
---
Maybe some kind of armour piercing weapon and/or perk, should help with damage. She can't kill you if you kill her first 
---
If you want I can help you.
---
For me, the problem is there's so many perk cards that are momentary passives. Things like lockpicking,  hacking, repairs, and crafting. They're not cards that actively benefit you except in limited circumstances. I'd like to see you be able to equip those. Having to constantly juggle cards is really uninteresting.
---
It's like we never even left Skyrim
---
Like i said in the OP, Leader of the pack event always has 1 star legendary wolves, and they are always level 10. Being level 10 they have  MUCH larger loot tables, and they rarely drop lvl 1-5 items. Im also looking for a place that atleast has a CHANCE of 2-3 star enemies.
---
I’m trying to level up and I didn’t know at the time so I don’t have super duper and ammunition maxed
---
I usually start a session with 20 purified water. During my vendor run, I'll sell that down to 5 if I run out of other things to sell. I don't need more than 5-10 for a 2-3 hour play session in my experience (drinking other things like cranberry juice, firecracker berry juice, booze for the recent challenges, etc).
---
You really don't need that much purified water for anything so I highly recommend just dropping it all.
---
I like this idea, but I'd like to have less benches that do more so that I can make my camp more interesting without reducing the functionality.
---
That's funny bc my 1st character I played tse build and when the nerf hammer came i started a new player for melee build. Fyi starting the new character far easier to spec out then to waste points moving around i think. Plus i still find the quest to be interesting because i played through slower and took my time. I speed ran my first go around. 
---
Yeah my new character I’m going to take my time with
---
Ppl like you kinda ruin games it’s why we have pay to skip grind or pay to win stuff cause you complain you don’t have enough time to bad then go play something else 
---
&gt;Bethesda is stupid
---
&gt;since the original. 
---
You're going to be playing Fallout for a long time, Meanwhile they will go from game to game along with the herd all the while moaning at each game and nitpicking the nitpicky points of each and every game. You have the last laugh already!! And slowly Fallout will get to be more Fallout as it grows.
---
It's like the Star Wars Prequels herd mentality of hate, they will fail.
---
Glad it's not just mine then. Had my pet deathclaw attack the crops then when I removed those the generator. He then walked to my friends camp who is nearby and destroyed hers...
---
Hopefully Bethesda fix the bugs with tamed pets D:
---
In all my travels in the game searching high and low I have only ever found about a half dozen locations that are flat enough to build a tent without one side of it floating a few feet off the ground. Flat areas are rare, but also your in the Appalachia mountains so don’t forget it.
---
So much for gathering Mr.Fuzzy Tokens or whatever they’re called. These tokens just became ultra rares- I’ll sell mine, 1000 caps each. 
---
About the cameras... If you have some old Androids or iPhones laying around (or any you can get for free or cheap), you can turn them into security cameras with a free app.  They don't have to have cell service on them, just wifi.
---
The one I use (Alfred) lets you check in live remotely, and will alert you to motion and records 10 seconds to the cloud upon motion detection.
---
I always try to mention it when I see people talk about security cameras because they are usually expensive and not great quality compared to even a cheap 3 yr old budget phone or tablet. 
---
I’m so hoping for an April Fools Day goofiness of some type - water purifiers temporarily dispensing nukashine, insult bot replacing train station vendor, scorchbeasts making “pew pew” voices or barnyard animal sounds, Fast travel to your camp and end up at rando camp instead, whatever. Just a mostly inconsequential thing that only applies for 24 hrs...
---
Lol - 3, people are stupid... 
---
Woah that’s cool!
---
Not trying to toot my own horn, but I come up with a good pun every once and a while
---
I respect other people’s opinions and am sorry that so many people are having their fun killed, but I honestly don’t understand why griefing in this game as an issue and feel like most people should try to just grow thicker skin. Why not try to understand griefing as part of the game? It can be fun... kind of like if you were up against raiders or something. If it becomes too much, it isn’t hard to server hop or mute another player. I mean, it’s a post-apocalyptic wasteland...
---
I don’t even think we can confirmed there dropping. Pretty sure the ones people keep posting are left overs from when people got into the dev room
---
I used my stealth boy so she wouldn't blast me dead in 2 seconds
---
Not sure how to start one, wife says they take a lot of fees out though, she said just to post her PayPal email, I'll pm you. You really dont have to though if you don't want to, I didn't post this with the intent of raising money, I don't want to inconvenience others with the actions done to me.
---
I will admit that I use to shit on the game because of all the backlash it got when it came out and I swore left and right I would never play it. My friend gave it to me because it came with his console so I decided to see what all the "mess" was about it and I fell in love with the game! I've been literally obsessed since I got my hands on it! So all this people just don't know what they're talking about. Just ignore them and keep on playing!
---
That sounds great !!!
---
The quest is repeatable and called forbidden knowledge. There’s a basement in once of the buildings just outside camp venture that has the drop box and some other goodies 
---
Thank you for your generosity. I'll copy here what I said to the other poster
---
"Not sure how to start one, wife says they take a lot of fees out though, she said just to post her PayPal email, I'll pm you. You really dont have to though if you don't want to, I didn't post this with the intent of raising money, I don't want to inconvenience others with the actions done to me."
---
I think that feature is actually pretty good.  Keeps one or two people from just dominating a server and encourages teaming up to take them down.
---
Of course, if you're surviving by being sneaky and quiet and avoiding popular areas, then having the target is going to feel shitty. But it does push you into pvp instead of sneaking. 
---
I've been where you are. I had someone break into my home and steal my pokemon game collection. I had Red and Blue in their original boxes since I was 8 years old.
---
The stash already does that, in my experience if it's in the stash it doesn't decay
---
Forgot to add that I’m on xbox 
---
When i want serums I find the highest level people i can find on my server and message them. Most I ever paid was 300 caps. Happt hunting!

Not yet. I will source you some

In the ranger district office it’s on the shelf behind the reception counter

Is it only nuka? Wtf

I posted an idea awhile back about an improved pet system but it drowned among the usual posts.
---
We need a Name system and a pet reviver craftable.

---
Horde events generally have legendary enemies, ranging fro. 1-3 stars. Stick to the forest hordes for low level legendaries.
---
I mean, if you have 2x acrobats, it’s the same as PA- immune to fall damage.
---
Idk about goat legs though 
---
That “violated” feeling is universal. Having someone enter your home is a very personal attack. With home defense shotguns are point and shoot, no aiming if panicked. They also tend to stop at one room, whereas a bullet can pass through many walls - which is especially bad if you live in an apartment. If you decide to buy a weapon for home defense the most important thing to do is to get trained how to use it at a shooting range, and get familiar with how it works and how to respond in different situations (a lot of situations are muscle memory and reaction, not a lot of thinking time). Choose the weapon you feel most comfortable using and you’re most accurate with (the most important thing is being able to hit a target... there’s no VATS in real home defense). A lot of firing ranges rent out various types of firearms to use on the range. If you’re new to firearms it’s a good idea to try out different types and find the style you handle best and you’re most accurate shooting. After buying it take it to the range at least a couple times a year to stay familiar with how it feels and operates. 
---
i guesso
---
Nothing treasonous about infiltrating an opposing faction and stealing their plans.
---
Ok, sorry can’t help I’m on PS4
---
Your title makes my brain hurt
---
I really like this. Kind of pickling or jamming fruits and veggies. That’s a great idea an a lot of thought went into it 
---
2k
---
I haven't seen one of these in-game, just the store.  Anyone have a picture of it in-game?
---
I mean, cryptids are also kinda like gambling cuz of the random weapon/armor drop from most of them
---
Ah, no worries. But of advice though, make sure you have the plans to make at least 2 large generators. Ammo machine takes 20 power so you're up shit creek if you dont have the plans already
---
I had one, it dropped dead while i was cooking Glowing Meat Steaks, i guess i didn't feed him very well.
---

---
Pretty sure they are talking about the mask?
---
Im on xbox and can craft all of them
---
Maybe it’s from playing a lot so I know what to do, but I’m constantly selling off water (and sometimes food) and/or watching it expire in my inventory. 
---
Pretty sure they said rare outfits?
---
2500 and we have a deal
---
R.I.P. Mrs. Pebbles! 
---
I mean the second sentance of that should have given a clue but I would say they should at least have a chance to drop for people to trade them.  The entirely too small number of them defeats the point of saying "trade to collect" when there is nobody able to trade them let alone start getting them...
---
Well the thing is I can get it to work if I do the trick I detailed in the post. So my issues isn't getting above 60fps per say, its the issue with the game not understanding 144hz on load up. I get over 80fps at 1440p once i do my "Trick"...
---
I had 4 that I dumped in my plan purge. Got them all from events.
---
Awhile back I went into Barnes &amp; Noble to snag the fallout tabletop game since it was my birthday and I wanted something nice. The little lanky dude at the register asked me, 
---
"Oh you like Fallout? Have you tried 76?" (This was in December, a month after the game came out).
---
I said, "Yeah it's pretty fun. I love the grind. Theres a few speed bumps here and there but you learn to deal."
---
"Idk it looks pretty terrible to me, I mean why would I buy a game that's so obviously broken?"
---
Like, dude. If you're gonna bash my game then why didn't you come out and say it before? Lol after that whole encounter my girlfriend said that my whole demeanor and face changed from enthused to just annoyance to the point the guy had to cut himself off prematurely.
---
It seems to have an issue with anything over 60hz...
---
Hopefully this works out better than the Prydwen amirite
---
Rads are applied, but not the full almount. My testing showed “&lt;1 rad/shot”. And I think it’s like .1 or .01 rad/shot. 
---
I can do that. Be on around 2pm EST US, if okay

As much as it sucks, it’s always a good idea to sit down with your agent at some point and ask about how your coverage works and how much. Most people don’t find out until they need it - and it can come up short. If you live in an area more prone to burglaries, you may want to increase your coverage. Also, take pictures of everything in your house now and keep it on file. A lot of people lie about their losses so insurance companies can be a little slow in paying. They will pay quicker if you have all your stuff recorded in photographs.
---
I find the song annoying and turn off the jukebox first thing. 
---
There were lots of problems at launch... But they were the kind of problems you experience after successfully logging  into the game and playing it, which is substantially better than a lot of other game launches. 
---
I really hope so as well. Even before the scorchening, he was dubbed "Mr. Overprotective" by my friends as he would constantly roar at them and try to attack anyone else that came by. He wouldn't be able to deal any damage, but it discouraged my friends from stopping by. Even worse random people would attack him in self defense only to get marked as wanted, at which point he could then murder them.
---
It's hard to say things are priced reasonably when a floor costs like 10$ and a PA paint costs like 20. The DLC for FO4 was cheaper and had far more content, surely they can adjust the prices to be more sensible.
---
Thanks anyways :)
---
Okay I’ll be on around then
---
Really? How much do you want for them? :) 
---
I will try that if I don’t have any luck, thanks!
---
I actually live close enough to West Virginia that I decided to check into the actual Fasnacht parade because of the in-game. It ended March 2nd. 
---
It’s really a pain in the ass. Bethesda needs to understand that it’s a virtual world game where players grow. When everyone is a teen you set the daily budget at 200, but by now many of us are adults now and the tiny daily 200 quota per vendor and total 25k is a joke. Veterans can walk around WS with their eyes closed and axe 200 caps worth of loots, it’s really killing the momentum. How about a floating quota that increases with players’ levels Bethesda? Do something to keep us grinding. 
---
Sounds good. Thanks
---
Ever get confirmation on this?
---
I found deep pocketed at the watoga shopping plaza like 2 days ago for 550 caps! (xbox)

There really is a subreddit for everything. I don't know when I'll be able to afford a good gun, but I'll definitely post something there when I'm ready. I've grown up with boy scouts so I've shot .22 rifles and a 20, 12 and 410 shotguns, and my mom's 380 beretta from the Navy. And some black powder rifles too, those were fun. Lot of work to get a shot off but there's something fun about making your own shot and then using it to put a hole in thick sheet metal. Not much experience with handguns besides the beretta, hadn't even shot the .22 revolver. Wasn't really to shoot, just as more of a keepsake. I don't want to get another gun though without somewhere safe to put it. Wife used to shoot shotguns and rifles competitively as a kid. And her brother built and m16 I think it was. I actually own a shotgun, it was my grandfather's, but it's at my parents place in a big gun vault in their basement. And it's got a choke on it for clays.

I used to see the prize but all the time along the river near Site Alpha.

Do you have home &amp; contents insurance? I think you could just change the password on Xbox.com to save your account from being used by the thief, then when you get a new xbox just log back in? 
---
Your progress is saved to your “profile” which is saved on Microsoft’s servers AFAIK?
---
There's a random event I've seen where a red sentry bot will come up to you and say you're its commander. It will follow you around and fight for you until it dies.
---
So they obviously have some of the code for NPCs following a player. I really wouldn't mind if they made it so you could tame animals and have them follow you, but make them fairly weak damage wise and have the trade off be that they won't die, just go into a weakened state where you have to stimpak them. Like in Fallout 4 survival. And if you don't stimpak them in a certain amount of time they will die.
---
Different torsos for your different mods... sucks

Yeah, I want the speakeasy music....

Why do I feel the need to carry 30 fusion cores on me?  I don't need that many. I just can't walk away from one when I see one anywhere....
---
You getting downvoted but you're right. I hate it when people just start complaining because"what I want isn't there and I think it should be and now this has ruined my entire experience." 
---
It's the same people who get upset with the Star wars sequels and prequels. If you're having fun with it, just enjoy it. Who cares is x thing isn't there or can't be done in game or OMG this cosmetic piece of gear replaces my armor ...
---
Yea, it's a worrying thought. A .22 is the BB gun of the gun world, but it still hurts and can kill. I certainly don't want to be shot with even BB guns. Airsoft without protection leaves bad enough welts.

Consoles record gameplay automatically, you just have to hit the share button/ record to save the last 15,10,5,3,1 minutes of gameplay based on your settings... so try again. Not to mention that consoles also have a screen shot button. The reason you don’t have any proof is because there is none to be had, the masks aren’t dropping.

Noice

Yeah my somewhat of an issue is that, I’m a melee build but i have to have my weight reduction perks. With that being said I get a 10% bonus in damage too my two handed melee because storage. 😂 I’ve had an idea that you could just scrap a skill tree you might not be using to let your skill of choice go to 30 instead of 15. But idk who knows. 
---
Everything in a can! Soup in a can! Water in a can! A can in a can! 
---
To be fair, events also counted as quests, so not as bad.
---
That’s smart 
---
That is a thought... Had a friend in highschool that would hunt deer by bow, might have to call him up.
---
I have removed all shadowed/chameleon armour, removed all sneak my perk cards - tried in VATS and without, melee and ranged - no joy with any of it. Annoying 😒
---
Isolated cabin - slocum joes 
---
Just FYI, fire safes only last for a limited time. We went through a wildfire and everyone’s safes melted down. But if the fire is not very long and fire dept gets it knocked down quickly, your stuff could be okay in a fire safe. Most have time ratings on them for how long they can last and at what temps.

200 a piece
---
Thanks i now know i got all the stuffed animals 
---
If you can get yourself an Emergency Protocols torso mod for your T-60 chest, you can stay in the PA and be super tanky at 20%. I run a low health PA/HW/Explosives build and with zero defensive perks I’m still pretty tough to kill at 19% health, and my damage is awesome. 500/bullet with a Gatling gun? Yeah baby. 
---
If you want to take advantage of Unyielding for a melee or VATS build, it’s a good idea to pick up a couple defensive perks (Blocker for melee, as that’s your biggest burst damage threat, and/or serendipity as that will help all-around damage reduction, it’s just more spikey). 
---
The only daily I have been able to get since patch 6 is thrill of the grill. It will also let me repeat it every time I server hop.
---
I never noticed it so I assumed... that actually makes me upset we can’t get more instruments including hillbilly type ones like a jug or kettles to complete the banjo set up 
---
I did summers on my grandparents' farm too, in Arkansas. I can confirm this post. 
---
The only thing I could think of that we would need, is pectin for jams &amp; jellies. I would also like to see a plantable hot pepper soon, I love making jalapeno jelly IRL. 
---
Consensus is yes but no hard facts
---
Did you try the scan and repair from within the Bethesda launcher (not the one for the launcher itself, but for fo76)? Takes ~15 minutes.
---
Need a working fridge too. Tired of harvesting my plants only for them to spoil in my pocket
---
The only thing is i am low on crimson and coal but ill do my best  
---
Great idea!
---
That’s a nice shade of green.
---
I only had one really weird trade experience. Backstory-  I usually just sell serums, maybe some specific junk, but have gathered some decent weapons and armor through grinding and buying from others. Still don't have a handle on the pricing for them, so I'm hoarding at the moment. With bear arms, it's more efficient for me to carry all my heavy weapons. 
---
So, I meet up to sell someone serums, all 19. We go to trade and the trade menu keeps closing as I'm trying to price stuff. No sooner than I get 2 or 3 priced then it closes. The person isn't buying any and wants them all priced before he will buy any. They were all priced the same, so it's not like a buy 1 get 1 free thing or anything were I could rip him off. I explained that we keep getting kicked out, I wasn't going to price them all at once, he could buy 1 at a time or find them elsewhere. 
---
Checked his inventory quick and he's already got some serums. Tell him he's already got them, why does he want to get more of the same ones. He says how could he "have bought them from you when I have not given you any caps." Not sure if they were from mine or not, should have paid more attention to what I had before but I know I did not get any caps from him. I tried to do a video capture after to see if anything was off but too much time had passed. He was a lvl 150+ so it's not like he didn't understand how the trade function worked. I'm thinking he was trying the trade steal exploit but again, have no way to prove it. If it did work, he may have gotten 1 or 2 serums at most. I still have all my weapons and armor. Just an odd experience all around. 
---
I have plague Walker right now (got it in the attempt to regain marsupial). How effective is it?
---
I ignore all invites from random people. 
---
I’ll give that a go now, take it you wouldn’t have any idea what’s causing it? 
---
Oh... *glances at 1000 caps* oh...
---
Excuse me a moment I need to go to Whitesprings
---
It actually adds +3 AGI so I don't think OP knows what they are talking about.
---
At least he made to your CAMP :) 
---
based on timing, that may have been my nuke to Morgan town last night to farm cobalt flux south of town and glowing ones for the remaining ingredients. 
---
It seemed like everyone on the server showed up here hooting and hollering to get flux where the night before I was alone at White Springs after the nuke with everyone else at the parade
---
Ok my gt is K1ll3r w4ffl3 
---
Treasure maps and technical data 
---
I couldn't even getting f-ing event to start the one night I was able to play for a little while during this f-ing event.
---
Thanks for doing the science!
---
Ikr ! The parade music is just super catchy I got hooked the first time I heard it 😂
---
Are you sure you get them from technical data? I’ve never seen anyone confirm that nor seen that.
---
Your all so so so gullible Bethesda is making the drop rates low for rares ,because they want to see the severity of duping and start further pinpointing on whose duping and who is being good ,just trust me 
---
Appalachian mad lad
---
Because the game isn't good, pretty objectively. We belong to a small minority of people who can still milk fun and enjoyment out of it, but outside or circle, the game is pretty heavily reviled. 
---
Me and some friends had the same question. No deffinitive answers.
---
Alot of people place a single concrete foundation and then metal stairs going up to what would be your regular house footprint, thus making it easier, by just having a 1x1 square to place
---
OP, I have a 1st gen Xbox One that I don't use anymore (upgraded to the Xbox One X). If you want it (as in I'm giving this to you for free), let me know.
---
I like the OP idea, but with you on decay.  I think solution is canned versions are not as helpful as thier fresh counterpart but don't decay.  Could be decrease in food %, but I think decrease in effects might make more sense.
---
Okay no worries, I’ll take whatever you can get me! 😁
---
It takes 1 red paint and 1 blue paint to repair the commie wacker. So there is a use besides scrap. Just saying.
---
My camp is in the open house down the street from the fire department. I used to have a yao guai who would walk up and down that street patrolling and keeping me safe, until one day a rando player visited and was immediately attacked by my yogi for no reason so we had to put him down :( I signaled the player with emotes asking to help kill it and then a lot of sorry hearts afterwards. I miss him but not him attacking randomly, even attacking my teammates.
---
No updated word beyond the “looking into it” from the notes after the vendor patch.  
---
Amazing video, btw!  
---
I love that your crew really made the town come alive with all their shenanigans.  Also just saw your airship build, that was awesome too!
---
I bought mine from a player
---
Best 250 caps I ever wasted
---
I love this idea!!!
---
Papa Nurgle smiles upon Appalachia!
---
I mean, the way they fly around in that NICCEEEEE curvular way, plus the fact that they come down to the ground and go up and personal with you.... they are some pretty sexy Beasts right there.
---
All that jet makes people do crazy shit
---
Exactly.  That makes it much easier to place
---
I hope they add quests with it, or at least make it to where we'd need the animals skin to craft each one. 
---
I think refrigerators are great idea.  I think both canned food and refrigeration could make sense, just like irl.  Or is it too complicated to have refrigeration be good for milk but not so great for some fruits and veggies?  Maybe refrigeration keeps ingredients from decaying while you gather ingredients but once removed they decay again vs. Canning that would be permanent not decay item?
---
Both are high potential logical next steps.
---
Every time I hear the flapping I GET HARD
---
 Lol
---
Thank you all for the overwhelming support, I didnt expect this to get as big as it has. I didn't post this in the attempt to raise money, but if you do want to send me and my wife a little something to help, her paypal is linked to the email Acrossthestrawberry@yahoo.com she said I could just go ahead and post it. 
---
No lol, that’s just what I’ve been told. I do know for sure you get them from treasure maps. 
---
That’s what I usually do but there’s no moving this monstrosity I just build in the mire! I’ve embraced my inner Ogre though so stay outta my swamp. 
---
Have done, thanks to a quick helpful post in the other thread.
---
It's a full body suit of apparel. I remember a loading screen in fallout 4 saying that inly specific clothing that was thinking enough could be worn with armor, which only included clothing like the vault suit and road leathers ect. It's the design of the game(s), there's never been a piece of clothing you can wear over armor in a Fallout game as far as I'm aware. 
---
A player once unloaded on me with a miniun, the Serendipity symbol kept dancing in the middle of my screen as I took no damage, not even slap damage
---
He got mad and turned to my camp--
---
Serendipity can be ur angel and ur devil
---
Nope. But given that you just downloaded it, first thing to do is make sure the files are all intact. The two times I got stuck in load screens, either scan/repair worked or completely quitting all Bethesda processes in the task manager and starting it back up again.
---
You can do a test, start smoking without filters every day. Report back when you get cancer.
---
Who wouldn't? I love it when they seek me out from half a mile away and just wont go away until I smash them hard to the point of exhaustion 😍
---
What’s the point ? They can destroy my camp ? But for what ?
---
So, I've tested playing with Chrome closed and no crashes for about an hour, so the problem persists only with Chrome running, don't know why it happens, but now at least I can play the game.
---
If you're able to hold your own or hop in with some higher levels, the Uranium Fever event spawns tons of mole miners that drop a bunch of junk that can be scrapped into steel. There's also a workbench right beside the event so you don't have to slog back anywhere over-encumbered.
---
4770k, GTX1060 16GB ram and SSD for the game, I have zero issues with performance or load screens,however I feel like game lag has gotten worse since the patch.
---
I'm pretty sure I smelled burnt toast. 
---
I simply had no idea fallout 4 was that broken too. I just used console commands if I needed to cheat. In fact looking back the 2 biggest console commands I used where no clip and increasing my inventory. I guess Fallout players like to both explore and hoard things. 
---
And 76 is banning people for doing what fallout taught us to do for decades. 
---
Going to post the PayPal on the main post. But it's Acrossthestrawberry@yahoo.com
---
And again, thank you for your generosity. You really don't have to do this. 
---
As for consoles, yea, I'm a pleb, but only cause I can't afford the PC setup I dream of. Someday soon hopefully. PC masterrace. 
---
The beer does exist, just not in the wild that I've seen. It's one of biv's recipes; beer plus other effects.
---
What mutations do you want?
---
I just had a 10 year old screaming over his mic repeatedly that was convinced the only way to get a rare mask was to let 4 of the bots die. We protected all of them and man was his rage real. More on topic though I think you’re 100% right and they don’t drop. 
---
It’s going round in my head right now lol.... doot doot doot du du doot du doot du doot du du du du... 😂😂😂
---
Thank you for setting this up. For those seeing this, you don't have to donate, as that wasn't the intent of this post, but if you want to be so generous to send whatever you feel, my wife's PayPal email is Acrossthestrawberry@yahoo.com
---
Okay well tried scam and repair that didn’t work so I’ll try task manage I guess, cheers.
---
If anything, I'd hold on to at least a few legendary pieces that won't take up too much space (ie lighter gear/"Weightless" affix) and wait for the Legendary Vendor come May.
---
If you put what system your on lots of people will help. 
---
If your on PC I think I have an extra plan.
---
Marsupial, chameleon and speed demon 
---
I look at it as an opportunity to rake the Zen sandbox clear and start again :)
---
I do 10 or more technical data turn ins a day and haven't gotten one. Anyone need a bomber jacket? 
---
Yeah.
---
You have to die by nuke to get it.
---
You need to stand right where the radioactive symbol is on your compass. And let the nuke smack ya
---
And when you do it, dont forget to look up so you can watch the nuke smack ya in the kisser. 
---
Looking up isnt required but is fun
---
Ok give me a sec. Damn game froze😕
---
No they are afraid you might destroy their camp if they team with you.
---
All you have to do is die in a nuke blast. As long as you are in the blast zone it will pop the trophy
---
Just anywhere inside the blast zone area before the nuke hits.
---
Flechetes for sure. It makes it a big shotgun, plus I don't know if they fixed it duplicating ammo on dead enemies. 
---
Www somewhere that putting a campfire down and placing your structure on top of that makes it easier. Truth or fiction?
---
What do they both do? I’m using it for long range unless the fletchletes all do the same amount of damage
---
A guy at my work openly shits on the game - which he hasn't even played - but defends Anthem even more than I defend 76. I haven't played Anthem though so I'm not just going to regurgitate all the negative shit I read online. 
---
That's not a bad idea. I like it 
---
Y'all sound like how furries sound when they make deathclaw porn
---
I've been having the same issue, too. Right at the end of the event sometimes I just get DC'd right before the rewards would come.
---
Hi
---
Wish I had been there. I have a talent for making people even madder by mocking their impotent rage.
---
lolfinished 
---
Condition on canned foods shpuldnt really be a thing sinxe thats what canning does, if done correctly will store the food indefinately, with some old canned goods found decades later still being edible. However, it could open the possibility of not canning the food correctly and you just lose the materials required
---
I think it only counts for the "bare" weapon weight. Any mods still weigh a ridiculous amount.
---
hydraulic bracers were glitched at the time.  The tesla does stack, but its underwhelming at best and useless for pvp
---
Well that explains it. People used to not be so sensitive that they make blog posts about Tshirt banter. Simpler times. 
---
I want real time VATS in Fallout 5
---
I have received plans for T-60 BOS armor paint for Initiates, Knight, sergeant and captain. Now I have also turned in a hundred or more of technical data. 
---
No they’re real on console at least, I can’t speak for PC, but basically it involves the person who you’re trying to rob to be getting in or out of power armor. 
---
Thank you very much. 😊
---
Sorry it didn't help.
---
Should have
---
No worries, thanks anyway. 
---
If you are on, I’ll grab it. 
---
Looks like someone is fishing for some free shit. 
---
Sent some your way. Hope it helps.
---
I came to the conclusion that they were using one of those builds that do 4K+ damage. 
---
Yeah. I’ve always thought that part of the reaction to 76 was delayed reaction to 4, but maybe I’m wrong. 4 certainly had high points, but it was with its release that I really began to doubt Bethesda’s ability to do the series justice. 
---
76 captures the feeling of surviving in the wasteland much better, even with power armor everywhere. I also prefer 76’s story, and I love the holotapes. Far harbor had a good story, but the main quest of 4 really disappointed me. Not to mention the role playing restrictions to being a voiced character looking for a lost son. 
---
Who's resources are being used if your in a friend's camp building?
---
Last night on a server a level 60 player nuked WS (gj bro), but probably people were too busy with the parade, nobody showed up. Likely he figured when there’s many players he could just hide far from the fight and ‘tag’ the glowing ghouls with nades or shotgun. It didn’t happen that way. I was in the central area collecting some flux, heard some machinegun and grenade explosion, then saw him running away from the club house chased by a dozen glowing ones, it was just hilarious. Before I could lend a hand he was overpowered by the glowing ones, and after respawn he didn’t come back into the nuke zone again. 
---
The one I'm in right now is working while they're marching but one of the robots is flickering in and out a bit.
---
That's just how it be lol
---
That is pretty sick, i love it, reminds me of the airship i built in FO4, but doing it in FO76 with its restriction is a whole new level of impressive
---
Is the handmade any good? or an LMG? I don’t use melee but prefer guns. I am not so sure which gun I should pick.
---
"Hancock disliked that."
---
Strange, I’ve died from a nuke twice and haven’t received the trophy.
---
May I have speed demon as well? :)
---
I also got a soldier mask and beret in one shot, it was my first run and 1 bot had been taken out.
---
I’ve had the comment “I never knew about the dups in FO4” thrown at me a few time, but specifically as a “you are a cheat, you said you have a history for looking for cheats”, but to tell the truth, it was a random youtube video suggestion that told me about the Dogmeat dup, and then I went looking. 
---
That said, it is a **single** player game; since Mario’s warp zone, I have looked for cheats in single player games. 
---
Since Counterstrike, I have abhorred the use of cheating in **multiplayer** games. 
---
To cheat in a multiplayer environment, especially when it can affect and/or hurt others, is not only a sign of a complete lack of skill on the player’s part, but also shades of laziness that can go up to apathetic cruelty.  
---
T60 BOS paints come from Tech Data turn ins.  If you are looking for the BOS Combat Armor mods... those do not come from Tech Data, and are not called paints either which is why the user responding likely got confused.  
---
Yes lol im sorry i forgot what you asked for
---
I just don't have the patience to collect 100 dirty waters...I know with super duper might not actually need that many... But certain I'd get 70 and then be pissed I ended with 48 boiled water and had to collect more.
---
Ill choose to do easier challenges.
---
So? Maybe make a suggestion to change this, rather than have a petty little rant
---
Perfect post. A+
---
Thank you so much, you are heaven sent 😁
---
wait there are lvl 90+ glowing ones? Always found the lvl 68 ones in WS
---
Fight club!
---
Last patch they changed the properties of the campfire. I loved having my scarecrow in the campfire. It saw the campfire as dirt, but no longer. Not sure if this would have an effect on what you're talking about or not.
---
I would enjoy doing the event alittle more if the sloth was 50
---
You are welcome anytime!
---
My paints seem to have gone in order since the update.  I had half a dozen initiate prior to patch 7.  Now I got Knight, Knight CPT, Knight SRG, and Officer.   Never a repeat either.  Seems to be every 5-10 turn ins.  
---
Jester, demon, sun, old man winter, and the death mask. 
---
Flechettes turns the harpoon into 5 or 6 smaller ones, like the mirv on the fat man. The barbed is just a regular harpoon but does more damage 
---
I like my .308. with the rifle perk cards and Max level I can one shot most things in mid level events. "The big guys take a few shots though I death claws scorched beast ect"
---
Place your power armor and you get 10 weight back for a minute.
---
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
---
I've had tons of stuff decay in the STASH, it doesn't help keep food fresh at all.  I usually just carry all my spoilable food and keep Good with Salt and Thru Hiker on.
---
I am
---
I'm at the golf club when you come online
---
See, I was an idiot who sold my Gameboy advance. I regret it everyday. I got like 50 bucks for it with all the games. I had red, blue yellow, gold, pinball, and then Tetris, super Mario Bros deluxe, Mario golf I think, and some other games I don't remember. Haven't sold anything since that.
---
Thanks man. Keep your head up. It sucks. There's no other way to put it, but you've got this. 
---
I've also been well within the blast zone and died from the blast and have not received the trophy.  
---
I thought so too but many pieces were heavy already, no mod added whatsoever. Like a 90 weight reduced bloodied railway rifle weighs 8 lbs, a 90 weight reduced suppressor’ shotgun weighs 11 lbs, a weightless armor weighs 3 lbs, fresh from the corpse of mobs. Those three star items are really two and two are actually one. 
---
I think the person who did the calculations mistook ‘90% weight reduced’ for ‘90% of original weight’, so it’s really only 10% weight reduced. 
---
Anti armor deathclaw gauntlet or assassin's minigun are my go to for pvp.
---
I’d silver this, but alas no coins left.   Nice post, agree. 
---
I’ve seen that too, but I can’t usually save the sloth. 
---
If I ever get on I can make you a set 👍
---
I played World of Warcraft since 2006, only recently stopping when Fallout 76 came out. I've never missed a single day of WoW due to suspension/ban. I have 2 realm first achievments. Realm First Algalon and Realm First level 85 paladin. I also have the Plagued-Proto Drake, a rare mount gained through achievement only back in 2008/2009.
---
I am a long term committed gamer. I turn 30 in a month. I've never been banned or suspended from any game in my life before Fallout 76. This is the worst feeling in gaming.
---
The game is not good so maybe they thought you were learning disabled?
---
The only device we don't really use is my wife's iPad, everything else we still use. My wife doesn't own her phone, and I use mine till they die, which is usually like 4 years. But getting them for cheap is a possibility. Thanks for letting me know of some of the options.
---
Just FYI there is a way to stack the 1X2 stairs. Though be warned, once you place them, you can't remove them, so make sure your tower is in the right spot before you fill it with stairs.
---
I personally think that **currently** FO76 is my least favourite, however, eith constant free updates it could potentially be the best, especially if the "Wastelanders" dlc is what i think it is and adds NPCs to the game too.  
---
I would say at the moment the ithers are better but they have a great 'blank slate' to have a fantastic game built on
---
As someone mentioned above, you have to be where the radioactive symbol is, right where the nuke is landing. Simply being in the blast zone didn't trigger it for me until I physically got hit with the nuke.
---
Though I'm level 126 and never got the achievement for hitting level 100 so it's probably a bit wonky...
---
Good tip, but it won’t let you fast travel like that unfortunately 
---
I just don't understand how they think it pays off short term. I guess they don't think they will get caught and or shot.
---
Whats awol armaments???
---
F
---
Ah okay, yeah I've been playing for a while now but I've ignored unarmed because I've mainly been focusing on pve so power armor was most cost efficient and could still one shot shit with a bloodied build even without unyeielding.  However, now that survival is going to be a thing, looking into doing an unarmed cavalier build with a few unyielding pieces in there.  Was just curious if I could make PA unarmed a bit more viable also or if it would just make more sense to equip a super sledge whenever I have to hop in PA lol
---
Why are the brewing stations ridiculous? Do you want 5 minute events or do you want something that takes time so you’re not bored? The camp budget is pretty big. If you use turrets get rid of them because they’re not worth it. People like you are the reason this game has such a bad rep. You complain about all the little tiny things you don’t like about it. This isn’t even a suggestion it’s just you whining 
---
They have released new content three weeks running—counting next week.   That’s prolific.  
---
I’ve got almost 200+ hours and I’ve yet to see it. Anyone else have the same experience? 
---
Yeah. I only had radaway for rad reduction but don’t have the slots to always have starched genes slotted. So I couldn’t take any radaway. 
---
Can’t you hold down ‘C’ to walk and do the same thing? Or is it slower than aiming?
---
Got ya
---
Probably because the internet wasn't so widely available and easy to access.
---
Simpler times.
---
Some people like to get others riled. Because the riled up people go and make a post on reddit, Twitter, etc. It gives them satisfaction, they dont like something, you defend it, they then feel even bigger than before because they KNOW they are right and you're just a dumb idiot. 
---
Or all they know about the game is bad press so they are dump founded when they see a random NPC in the world that actually likes the game. 
---
People fucking suck, sometimes.
---
I have a pet Radstag I think?  It is always in my camp and I can't kill it.  Each time I log in it is a different type.  (Levels change, sometimes glowing or albino.  Once it was three star legendary). I don't remember ever taming it, so not sure where it came from?
---
I did at one point tame a sloth and I forgot what happened to it, but I moved my camp and never had it at the new location.  Then last patch my camp was in one of the new no build zones so I had to move it and so I built a new house in new location.... That's when he showed up....
---
Harpoon gun is terrible at range. It can't even shoot the distance of the scope, you have to aim way above the target. 
---
“I’m going to one shot this sloth so you guys don’t get loot” as he’s over there shooting it doing no damage. 
---
I just to want to complete the challenge. Hopefully someone comes across it 
---
I've been playing Fallout since the first one came out in the 90's and have beaten all of them multiple times except FO:BoS.  As with all Bethesda Fallout games I don't like what they are doing to the overall lore, but enjoy the games as a standalone experience.
---
I only have about 100 hours in the game, including B.E.T.A., but I find it really enjoyable, it was just marketed wrong and rushed too much.  They made a walking simulator/exploration game with action RPG elements and marketed it as an action game, going as far as to sponsor UFC video blogs and running spots with NBA stars.  I assume the ven diagram of UFC fans hardcore enough to watch UFC video blogs and exploration game fans does not overlap much.
---
I really like where this game is headed, especially the Survival mode update, so I can explore in peace in Adventure mode.  I look forward to many more hours exploring Appalachia.
---
Been playing since beta day 1 on xbox and never once found it 
---
For me if I  stay back from the huge cluster of players as the bonfire is lit and quest ends I don't get DC'd. I personally sit on a nearby roof until of of the jubilation subsides. 
---
You are welcome :)
---
I share your heartbreak. I’ve lost two deathclaws so far and each loss is harder than the last. 
---
rip Craig. I hope you’re growing mushrooms in the clouds now.  
---
It, not me
---
Yep..fought it and beat it when I was level 35...nothing special but it took a few shotgun shells lol
---
Haven't tried that one, might also be the case :-)
---
Thanks.  Starting to do this in hopes of putting them in camp eventually.  I just have to remember to put them in my toy box (of course my stash is the toy box) before scrapping!
---
Yeah, I feel you. I was excited for the new content, but after finishing the brewing main quest line and doing the parade once, both times I was left with a feeling of, “Is that it?” I’m glad that new players will have more content when they start up the game, but as someone who’s been playing since launch, I was hoping their first batch of new content would have more depth to it. 
---
I’ll continue to look forward to the new survival mode, however. I’m hoping the added PvP element will add a much needed breath of fresh air to the game. 
---
I'm more excited for the friends I will make. Making an ally who is always there for PvP is much much more valuable than someone only in it for the story. Survival is my niche game. Can't wait.
---
I will start a new one for the limited times I want to try Survival.  But I appreciate being able to cross worlds with either.  
---
1 star wow. Maybe you can buy a bun with that.
---
I accidentally did it last night and realized it regenerates AP, but it might be slower than ADS. Not sure.
---
"Floating base? That's an orbitalin'...."
---
west tek sometimes has a couple two or three stars but not always. sometimes it’s all no stars and sometimes nothing at all but i’ve got some nice 2-3* weapons and armor there while farming xp
---
Does he move around? I found him by accident somewhere around the Ash Heap when I was fleeing a Scorchbeast with a sliver of health. I was able to grab the hard lemonade recipe. I thought I grabbed both but missed the lemonade.
---
For those curious, yes I got away. But I want that lemonade recipe!
---
Been playing since the beta and I’ve seen it three times, but the third time it disappeared right when I reached it. Poof. Just gone. Try doing the queen of the hunt daily event near Abby’s Bunker - I believe you have a fair chance of finding it. That’s how I initially realized it was even in the game. 
---
We may find out more as wild in Appalachia starts up.  
---
Stabilized does not provide extra armor penetration for the Gatling laser, but it makes more accurate
---
Be careful when crafting and repairing- it will auto scrap if you don't have raw resources :( I lost my first set of bears without realising. I ended up creating an alt character just as a keeper of bears 😂
---
Oh I'm gonna die a lot for sure. Should be fun
---
Please post his on r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Actually you have a good point
---
Anthem is an absolute dumpster fire in comparison. Not only is there hardly any end game content, but it's all bugged to hell. I played it for 3 days got to the endgame and haven't touched it since. 
---
You need the gourd itself, not the gourd flower
---
It's low-key hilarious that this game and the people who play it will go crazy about a bench 
---
I had the same question but it appears the daily to get recipes is from the robit in the shine cellar. The dailies you and I are thinking about, that need a certain brew to complete, are the Atoms dailies.
---
I got mine from claiming/defending a workshop
---
It's a random encounter so you have to server hop find him.
---
Trash, not max level. 
---
actually, I understand what you are “saying”, and suspect you should play different games and switch back and forth as new content arrives in each.
---
I like that FO 76 is slower placed, and I play it solo or just chill with peeps and have a good time, often doing stupid shit like switching to different outfits and masks and walking with the bots as they march. So, I love the event.
---
 I still haven’t finished BOS nor started enclave, but have explored most of the map.  I have lots to do yet.
---
TLDR you do you, friend.
---
Peace
---
They took your Monsters from the fridge? Damn savages.....
---
noooooooooo I'm to casual for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It's situational. It only works with certain random spawns, and you have to have Animal Friend maxed, and the creature you want to time has to be less than half your level. Then when you aim, an extra option to tame appears.
---
Check youtube for some spawn points. Some people say you need Wasteland Whisperer at 3 too, but that's not true. 
---
A good point. Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who think it's fun to mess with other people. 
---
Solution: Concentrated Fire level 3; VATS &gt;&gt; scroll to target fusion core &gt;&gt; shoot many times/use critical shot when possible
---
May not kill them but it does lock up their armor. Plus it takes one of their fusion cores so.... that's gotta hurt on an emotional level right?
---
the true hero, Thank you very much 
---
Saw it once. It vanished like a mothman.
---
Max out Martial Artist and Incisor under strength if you haven’t. Martial Artist especially. 
---
And there can be a robot called "canny" who lives in a basement somewhere and gives a quest every 24-hours. I love it.
---
True I suppose. Because the whole point of these servers is for pvp and because there is so few players in a server I guess it's good in a way.
---
Wheres west tek on the map? Easy farming for level 60?
---
You deserve an upvote. This is the kind of positivity we need. 
---
😂 Yeah I got those plans. Thanks for the tip!
---
When I installed Fo76, first thing I noticed was that there’s very few options to personalize the weapons. In a single player world it’s ok to have all weapons in the same dirty and worn look, but in a multiplayer game people want Identity and the makers of fo76 didn’t realize that. It’s good that they are catching up. The new excavator skin looks great. But for popular weapons there’s literally NOTHING. If you’ve played COD you know you can always find a nice skin for your MG42 to match your costume. There are literally dozens to choose from, unlocked as you progress and complete challenges. People pay real world money to buy them. Makers of 76 however completely missed it. Instead they want to sell mushroom hairs and emotes to wasteland dwellers. After five months we get one skin for lever action, this is not even funny any more. 
---
Yeah, hindsight, and all...
---
I obsessively keep receipts and documentation, so it wasn't a problem with the claim, it was the adjusters and "depreciated value" of all of our items. We disputed a lot of it, but they base everything on used values and the age. *Especially* for electronics.
---
Uranium Fever spawns 3 star mole miners, but they're at max level 40 so you won't get the most powerful version of any particular legendary, but any god roll legendary you get there is still going to be better than the vast majority of weapons even if it is a lv. 35/40 one.
---
I thought the brewing update was pretty meaty, even though I didn't partake in the actual craft brewing aspect, mostly because of the new locations and quest.
---
Fasnacht, not so much.  For as much variability as they built into the planning stages, which is welcome, the actual parade is pretty monotonous and I wish the event scaled appropriately.  It's also a week-long event, which is a big mistake in my opinion.  This game is staved for new content in general and spending all this time on something temporary seems like a really ill-conceived idea.  I like the additional CAMP decorations, though.
---
Honesty I've tried going back to 4, and just cant seem to enjoy it for more than an hour. I need to refresh my mods or something.
---
Ok so it’s not just me then. Was starting to wonder...
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b28221/legendary\_vendor\_location/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b28221/legendary_vendor_location/)
---
I agree, it just needs some effing content and a full map for end game players! 
---
I never thought of that, honestly. Then again, the meat pile thing is very inconsistent. Sometimes it takes a minute or so, sometimes they turn into meat piles immediately upon death, and there have been times where a corpse (unlooted) has stayed around my camp for nearly an hour.
---
When - read the roadmap 
---
Where - search this subreddit 
---
Before I get a gun I want to make sure I have a safe place to put it. I've also had a fair bit of experience with mostly shotguns, some rifles, and very little but still some handguns. Definitely am considering getting something though
---
I never tried those, but I did play Ark survival evolved when the winter mode came out and it was damn near impossible to survive
---
Yeah, but unfortunately, experience so far supports his information.
---
Fucking anti-vaxxers man they're gonna give us smallpox and polio
---
Here's hoping you get banned.🍻
---
Scorch beast drop bos combat armor mod plans. I’ve got a few after the patch removed them from Grafton station vendor 
---
Cheers. Is there a way of triggering uranium fever or just random occurrence?
---
I think that’s my turn off from solely multiplayer games which no developer will be able to fix and that’s the inability to stop multiple play styles. While this game like others (dayz), it ends up just being more of a social experiment then a deep satisfying experience.
---
on the blue building below the picture of the radio array east of whitespring. the mobs might be a bit tough for lvl 60 since they spawn level 46-68 but so far that’s the only other reliable legendary farming spot that i know of, also really good for xp
---
Yea. The thing is, it's a small neighborhood. My aunt lives next door and was home sick when it happened. There's never been a robbery in the neighborhood since shes lived there, which is most of her life. And definitely will take pictures of everything from now on. I just never expected to actually be robbed. 
---
Scorch beast drop bos combat armor mod plans but seems to be rare 
---
It totally does. Your power armot gets recalled when you respawn.
---
I did the event 10 times this morning. Nobody got anything except the same one's you see all the time.
---
One guy: "Fuck this Owl mask!"
---
Wes tek, watoga, whitesprings (not just the golf club, but the house to the left), generals steakhouse, harpers ferry. 
---
Cheers. Well ill just have to get kitted up and hope
---
 i dont die. Good xp with those levels at least. 
---
I originally posted this to contest the WAY public workshops are contested NOT the fact that they are. Maybe if you weren't so busy jumping on the wrong conclusions train you'd recognize you just made an ass of yourself by insultingly arguing a point no one is contesting.
---
I do still have my laptop, it was with me at the time. They also left my wife's. I don't have a steam account, but I will look into trying that out in the mean time.
---
Generals steak house? Never heard or seen this. 
---
20 hours = 5 same ole masks
---
Any or just the queen?
---
Thats not surprising. Everytime my friend gets really drunk he ends up in the same jail.
---
Already got them. Very important for melee. 
---
Thank you, I'm very grateful we are all ok. They certainly had the means to hurt someone once they got the gun.
---
I work retail and sell video games, I always wear my fallout stuff to work and if a f$&amp;# boi says the game sucks the debate begins! 
---
Oh, that is cute!  
---
I'd love to just have a FO76 tour of homes someday. Checking out camps is as fun as the rest of the game. People think I'm coming to trash their stuff but no, I'm just a weird tourist that wants to admire everything.
---
No need to, just transfer your caps to your mule and empty your account. People without sufficient caps to cover their pvp rewards or bounty shouldn’t be able to play but Bethesda thinks it’s ok, so just empty your account or shoot a piece of wall to get 5 caps bounty, you’re good to go.
---
Any. Not just the queen. 
---
Thanks. They got pictures and a description from a house they hit, so hopefully they are found soon.
---

Can you post a link/pic of your build?
---
Says game isn’t good yet follows the sub reddit 🤔 a really life pleb 
---
Well there goes my plan to start over an make a new camp. Not worth the risk.
---
Not sure if there was enough taken. Going to have to check in on it.
---
The ability to move your CAMP gets harder with the more foundation pieces you have.  That's why you see so many "floating" CAMPs with a single foundation and a staircase, because in order to replace those, all you need to ensure is that the single foundation can be placed correctly.  The more foundation pieces you have, the more likely the game will find *something* to complain about - like "floating," "obstructed," or other non-existent problems.
---
It sucks.  It's something they should have fixed months ago, and I'm not even sure it's on the radar given how Patch 7 supposedly made improvements to wall piece snapping and ditched the stacked foundation trick, but no one bothered to actually clean up foundations.  I don't know what Bethesda's problem is.  They have all these obscure building rules about floating, but it drives people to make CAMPs that actually float.
---
You can search it online. There you will find an exact location.
---
If rather just be able to bulk and sell ammo. .38 gets bulked in 100 unit packs, sells for 10 caps to vendors. Each ammo has its own bulk quantity and sale value.
---
thanks for the reply, got it now. 
---
I don't use mules. Guess I could just spend all my caps. But my character isn't really specialised for pvp so it could be a chance to become better.
---
Yea, my wide said it's ok to post hers, it's Acrossthestrawberry@yahoo.com. it wasn't my intention to raise money but I do appreciate the generosity of everyone. 
---
he asked for pvE. 
---
Welp, would make that banjo that spawns at the Whitesprings lookout useful.
---
We can make it stronger.
---
Any scorch beast. And rare. I’ve killed a bunch and only seen 1 mod drop so far but it’s the only way I’ve gotten them since the patch removed them from Grafton station 
---
YES !! This has always pissed me off lol like why can’t we sit and access 
---
That's good to know. I need me some sentinel armor lol.
---
Same, bonus was my screen went white after and I couldn’t respawn
---
“Whoever” would have been correct, but I’m pretty sure than in this instance “whomever” is also correct, being the direct object of “to”; many times people over-correct without a good understanding of the rules. 
---
Yea, probably will go back to lurking after this dies down till I can get back. However long that will take.
---
😂
---
Pretty sure it's random, but it shows up fairly frequently at least for me.
---
The suggestion was a bigger camp budget, and faster event timers.
---
I do, I just don't know if enough was taken. I'm going to check in on it today
---
And because of how responsive Bethesda has been to fixing "stuff"
---
I'm pretty sure the number of non-legendaries depends on how many are participating, at least in my experience. I've soloed it before with no issues, but when there were 3 of us, it's like they wouldn't stop coming. Just FYI...
---
Interesting thanks. Any idea on whether region matters?
---
Me too
---
Oh, no no. I'm a ps4 player primarily. But I'd be devastated if this happened to me. Consoles vs PC is a silly argument anyway. We all game, regardless of where it is- I just happened to sell my soul to Sony when I was a child. 
---
Level 6 AAE Gauss rifle 
---
No decent base building (compared to FO4), and a lack of new events isn't complaining about "little tiny things."
---
I don’t think so. I’ve found them on scorchbeast at white springs tho
---
Ooh okay, thank you
---
Thank you. I'm certainly glad everyone is ok. 
---
Correct, for example, scroll up one comment.
---
It really depends on a few factors.  The area within some fast travel points is off limits.  Charleston for example.  And some unmarked areas such as random spawn points, are also off the table.  I wanted to set up a trading post in an old storefront but because it was also a random spawn point for rare hats, the game wouldn’t let me.
---
Thanks. I don't know if they will catch them, but I sure hope they do.
---
He didn't specify that but even then, if he that is what he wants, there needs to be more detail such as specific time, an idea for a new quest etc
---
Thank you. I'm glad they didn't, with the gun they certainly had the means.
---
I always drop my known plans at the blue suitcase in Watoga, FWIW. And also found some good ones there, so I can’t be the only one. 
---
Alright, has anyone managed to participate in every job for the bots? I.e. play music, collect eggs, collect intestines, collect steins &amp; place party decorations ...
---
I managed to assist in 4 of those 5, play music was completed too fast.
---
Also, if there is less than 3 minutes on the timer when you arrive on site, don't bother. If you're the first/only one there, it will take that long to fight your way to the terminal. I have failed this enough times due to mobs blocking my path to the terminal inside.
---
I keep seeing posts on Xbox LFG selling mini nukes for 100 caps a piece. I seriously hope no one is buying these. I picked up 9 I’ll probably never use in one day of parading and I left a lot behind. 
---
I'm glad you put up the donation link. I'm sure I've got a few bucks lying around...
---
I start my game with at least 1 and never end up in the same place. I drank 5 once and found two new places on the map lol
---
I’ve seen it, it’s not much and it was pretty easy to kill. I think it should drop alien blaster rounds or mods for the alien blaster instead of just crystal
---
"Let me guess, laundry night? Nothing's clean?"
---
This. Just 'cause it's people don't like it doesn't mean it's a bug. Also, while this doesn't exactly help everyone, I'm sure there's a mod or two to alter the Hooded Rags and allow them to be worn over armor. It would be as simple as changing the equip slot. Not a bug. 
---
I have a friend that told me something similar.  
---
Spam a on him ime. He gets stuck in long dialog rants. Eventually, he will make reference to you "coming back". 
---
This is the dialog that will give you his quest.
---
I'm going to contact gmaestop and the pawn shops with the serial today. And Craigslist. And the cops said they didn't find any fingerprints, they just took pictures is all. It was 2 males, they hit a few other houses. One had a camera. And they didnt smoke in the house, and we don't do either. And I'm definitely still angry this morning. Now I have to clean up their mess. 
---
Ding!
---
Yea, thank you.
---
Zzzzz
---
You will be a lot happier if you cease to let what other people think impact you.
---
Sounds like a bug, unless you have an open Biv mission that's not completed. I'm sure you need to finish one before he will give another one.
---
Here's a fun bug. I was trying to turn in a Biv mission, and the game crashed. When I logged back in the door to Big Al's was boarded up. I re-logged and the door was back but the mission was gone like I'd never gotten it.
---
Contacting the pawn stores and GameStop today. Hopefully insurance will pay out and enough was stolen. 
---
I run 5/5 assassin sent trust me you can burn through it in less than 2 seconds. I have way more trouble against players wearing unyielding armor with a dodgy build. If they also use stealth boys and pop a few stims there us no chance to kill them. I am ok with that, as a fellow sentinel user it's not as good as you think it is against people who know its mechanics.
---
Added you if you're still interested! I'm from Sweden aswell, but I couldn't add your discord because I needed 4 numbers after: Flippen00#xxxx. 
---
Maybe chrome has a memory leak. Are you using any extensions with chrome? Have you updated chrome, extensions, and your video drivers? Very weird problem.
---
Go do the parade event, you’ll find like 10 people almost every time. It’s a short walk from Vault 76
---
That's awful. I guess you are not getting the event rewards?
---
Will do. Already had the police out here to take pictures. Going to give them a list of what we don't find today. Have the serial number thanks to links posted.
---
Hey you, you're finally awake.
---
Notice it alot yesterday. 
---
Wow, love the creativity both in building around existing buildings and the acting! Superb! :)
---
I enjoy the feel and damage of the handmade good for tagging targets for xp, loot and good enough damage with perks to hold its own in the wasteland. But idk what version or mods to put on it I'm going by raw gun feel
---
Haven’t done it for a while because it’s capped at level 40, did it a few times this week for steel and it was absolutely horrible. The three star managers dropped syringer, drills, and sometimes nothing at all. Back in last December it was my go-to event where I got several of my favorite weapons, not any more. Same with awol event, now nothing but wood armor pieces with occasional stalker’ rolling pins. It’s as if whenever some YouTubers say hey look at this great farming location, they get turned into waste dump. 
---
Lol Trust me in the break in that 80 lb German Shepard could have killed the intruder.  Better off in the cage really.
---
Ngl. I enjoyed the grind to endgame, but once you get there, there's nothing. Like literally nothing.
---
A agree because I used to go swinging my all rise through the woods in search of critters for food or Incase a ghoul jumped me and I kept hitting the goddamn firecracker berries and they would damage me. 
---
I don't think I'm creative enough for that lol. Also I'm only a level 15 so I don't have a lot of workshop plans. Maybe when I have more plans I'll copy one of Final Render's builds lol
---
I ran into the exact same issue, the pet taming system could be SO much better, imagine being able to have your pet accompany you and if they were given the normal companion invincibility/durability
---
I want to like the game but it's just bad right not sure they might fix it but it's bad NOW.
---
I have an aae handmade for sale, incase u decide
---
Just curious, if you happen to remember, where did you find a snallygaster at that level as a single spawn?
---
I just went to get mine and he wouldn’t stop talking so I had to spam my button to get the quest. 
---
Got the serial number, going to update local places they could sell it. Ive tried to update the original post with what I know
---
I think this could fit in the cooking station, but a good way to balance it would be to make it not as beneficial whereas if you ate it right after cooking it
---
Me too! My OCD definitely mess with me when I plant these crops. 😂
---
My discord is: Flippen00#9615, same here, played a shitton of FO4 But just geting started at 76
---
Sport, can’t remember if you got what you needed but if you’re still looking for Marsupial, I can hook you up. :) 
---
Haven’t seen one since the game came out and i was to low level to kill it. 
---
AWOL isnt worth it to me. Getting shredded by Col Gutsy’s to get a 1 star wooden leg armor is a waste. 
---
Fair, AA deathclaw gauntlet and AA .50 cal in that case
---
Yeah it's time guns got some love, melee gained so many new weapons with 76 but many of the new ballistics are very situational and/or impractical ie Black Powders, Crossbows
---
The anger about not getting stuff comes up with every game with something similar. Yeah, it sucks to not get what you want, but it isn’t a big deal. At least it isn’t a loot crate. 
---
It worked awhile for my deathclaw but then after the last big update he got turned into a radstag, so I couldn't tell ya 
---
Yes it is. Sometimes I end up planting carrots because of how much Razorgrains take up space or annoying how they all float even on flatter lands.
---
Exactly, pure waste of time and ammo. 
---
You get the recipes either after completing the quest, or as part if the quest startup.  Not every time, of course.  
---
If you are looking for 35-40 legs you can always just do the parade too for the sloth. 
---
Yep, same here
---
Thank you. 😊
---

Fox News was at one point the highest rated “News” channels in number of viewers.  It can be easily proven to be unreliable journalism, so obviously biased it’s a joke to anyone remotely interested in truth.

If he hit you with a melee weapon he was close enough for one of your mutations to hit him back. It then flagged you for pvp. It's the only thing that is possible after reading your post.

Ohh yes please! Plots would definitely work well with land not being flat.
---
It's perplexing to me why so many of you misunderstood the motivation behind my OP. 
---
Watch the video from 1:48 - 3:38 and you will understand exactly what I want to see changed, and so should you, because it's stupid, annoying, and wasted time better spent on actually fixing the fracking game.
---
Now go ahead and call me a whiny baby with my panties in a twist. Sticks and stones, children, sticks and stones.
---
I've killed it twice. Neither time anywhere close to Flatwoods. The first time it spawned at my camp when I ft there. Lvl 107, 250 hrs, xb1.
---
I hope they would look into it. They already have the nicer Razorgrains design so might as well replace the previous version for this awesome game! 😊
---
This is actually a really great suggestion. Some kind of anchor for your tamed creature to attach to.
---
It can be moved, maybe choose how they treat guests, whether to attack or not. Having this with be repair option would have me sold on farming the perfect companion.
---
Until something improves it, I am not using the taming feature anymore.
---
Thank you for your offer and generosity. The response of this community has been so wonderful. It wasn't my intent to raise money, just to talk, but if you want to donate, my wife's pay pal email is Acrossthestrawberry@yahoo.com. it certainly does feel weird asking for help. I'm certainly glad no one was hurt too. They could have really hurt our dog, she's really intimidating https://imgur.com/T3xgE3l.jpg at least when she wants to be. I have updated the post with what I know so far. And thank you.
---
I take it you havent actually played the game. It is a bug because every other clothing item over armor. Unless its specifically under armor. Stop commenting when you are clearly ignorant of mechanics.
---
I would argue 4 has got more quests 
---
Thank you for this list! I have been collecting all the stuffies since I started playing and I had close to all of them and then one day THEY WERE GONE and my heart broke so I gotta collect them again which is okay. It just kinda stunk. Can’t wait to be able to decorate my C.A.M.P with them, my stash box is almost full because I’m keeping stuff I want to display haha! 
---
Have you played the game? Every other clothing item goes over armor.
---
Thank you. I certainly hope so. And I am definitely glad, though I wonder if they would have tried if we had one of our cars in the drive.
---
I hope so, but I don't expect that they will. Who knows. This post has certainly made me feel better about it though 
---
Handmade is good but getting the mod plans are quite difficult. I've scrapped probably 50 just trying to get a better receiver and silencer. 
---
Stick with the combat rifle or hunting rifle as you can find more in the world to scrap so you can mod your weapons. 
---
Shotguns are also great. Especially the combat shotty. Again, easy to farm for mods. 
---
The handmade is just too rare to continue to farm and scrap early on. 
---
Yeah yeah yeah, blah blah blah on u’r end. I say these things cuz Bethesda reads these posts and it’s not whining. They want hear what people like and don’t like. To each is own. What I like and u like about the game r different. Don’t bash people for what they don’t like about somethin. Everyone is aloud to voice there own opinion 
---
But it is. Clothing goes over armor in 76. Stop being willfuly ignorant of mechanics and then argumentative about it.
---
But it is a bug, every other peice of clothing goes over armor. 
---
Man I get so much crap from friends for playing and enjoying it. How I was wrong to preorder it even though there was a discount and you got to play the beta before you were even charged for the game. How it'll never be a good fallout game. Tell me again, who's the only one here who owns the game? Who's the only one here who plays it? Wait... pretty sure that's me... LOL
---
Oh my god..
---
Stay safe.
---
Just because some clothing does doesn't mean every piece of clothing will do the same thing. 
---
Except clothing goes over armor in 76, sorry youre ignorant of mechanics.
---
Just because some apparel does one thing doesn't mean every apparel will do the same thing. 
---
I play on pc...i own consoles but my heart will always be with pc.

For pve anything instigating is awesome. I use an instigating Grognaks and an instigating deathclaw.  Don't yet have an instigating rifle, but imagine instigating + sneak. Ya. Waiting on the rng gods. 
---

---
It is every peice of clothing, this is the only one that isnt. Sorry youre wrong bucko.
---
Haha no worries, I completely forgot to add you. Got the materials now so I’ll add and message you then. Thanks again! :)
---
Love how every one of your replies is a personal attack on my intellect instead of being a decent human being and just saying your piece. 
---
I don’t have any mutations though... :(

I do read quite a bit, and I have posted some. I just wanted some support and people to talk to. I just don't really know what to do with myself after this. This community seemed like they would be kind, so I posted. I don't blame you for being suspicious though. I really wasn't making this as an attempt to beg. And my house really was robbed, I posted pictures of the broken door frame in a response.
---
I've only gotten disconnected once, but the lag and extended loading times for certain items has been insane with this event. I'd assume it would be due to all the server hopping to get to the event, though.

Theres this video of a guy leading people into a maze with a surprise
---
this guy can fast travel to his camp that is literally a flying piece of steel in the sky and land in a safe spot and i cant even fast travel to my camp without falling through the rock and dying with my scrap ending up inside a cliff face.
---
alright bethesda
---
Experiencing the same with Fasnacht, cannot loot the end legendary, the corpse freezes and no loot menu will appear on approach. I have yet to get loot off any three star legendary and I've been playing since release. I would love to collect my reward for the resources I spend! I love the game, don't get me wrong! Just frustrated by this one consistent bug.
---
Yeah this has happened to me multiple times the other day. I could not enter ANY building load screen. my game would crash. Top of the world was the worst. XB.
---
No ‘best’ location, just random now. Last night two three-star glowing ones at WS gave me one star stalkers’ tire iron and walking cane. After the other guy left I was the only player in nuked WS and I quit too shortly after collecting some flux. It’s really a bait and switch game now when most three star creatures only drop poor loots. 
---
I had 2 servers kick me and everyone else in it during SBQ fights yesterday. Literally everyone that was there like 12 people all got kicked at once. This happened on 2 separate servers. Stability was actually pretty good before this last patch but hey, at least we got a cool parade! I wish they’d test these patches a little more, I’d rather have stable servers than an owl mask tbh.
---
Thanks. Certainly glad no one was hurt. And this game I feel is worth buying twice. 
---
Its not a personal attack to say youre willfully ignorant of the game mechanics and argui g from that point of ignorance.
---
Thank you for your support
---
We should have the ability to toggle whether or not we want this item as an actual piece of armor. Say I want to wear Heavy Robot Pieces, I can't wear them without having my legendary equipment, which may or may not be robot, to be taken off. Same with like the BoS outfit. I believe it's the jumpsuit, along with the Envlave fatigues that look cool, but sadly are under armor so I can't lap them over my vault suit and stuff. 
---
Still doesn't mean it's a bug, it very well could be design choice man 
---
Why though ? 
---
How much caps?
---
"In my opinion facts are wrong." Yes, they are easily verifiable and they don't support your position. Blocking people who point that out is pretty sad kiddo.
---
I’ve got all plans already, well at least most of them.
---
I wouldn't part with it for less than 5k
---
Actually a pretty good thought that hadn't crossed my mind! I was planning on a new character anyways, but being able to tag high levels for other high levels to kill has a nice justice to it 
---
Given bethesda its safer to assume something like this is an oversight, given the rest of thier games.
---
Is it a bottle?  They are empty and considered junk.  The filled ones don’t have the word “bottle” in them.
---
Instigating will one shot almost all enemies in PvE, for those bigger ones like SB and mirelurk Queens carry an AA to finish the job. 
---
I see because this sub represents every single person on the internet.  Yeah, *that's* believable.
---
Not familiar with reactive plates but my x01’s stealth boy drains power whenever I’m in stealth. Yes it goes through cores much quicker than I thought. 
---
Then you have your answer. I ended up with a lever so I never went back to the handmade. 
---
Are you on the same character?
---
My condolences :(
---
I don't like the really long title, and nothing in your post section. It's a public forum, and I can say what I want! Lol
---
The true endgame is finding a place to settle down. Lol 
---
Empty as in quantum :(
---
Perfect!
---
Yep, farmed them both everyday almost until yesterday, now West Tek has both doors spawned out... And the golf course isn't even on my map. Checking on that now.
---
And if the guy you killed has zero caps, you get nothing, is that correct? 
---
Hope you find the bastard.
---
Seen later today.....
---
Id like to see washing machines in my camp.  Clothing condition should degrade until you wash it...🤣
---
What tasks change?  I’ve heard all the squirrels die off making the butcher task impossible to complete.
---
Chuckle. I have a large collection of Cultist's Daggers. Could be me on a good day.
---
*Bashes with nailboard* "Nobody talks bad about my family's moonshine!" 
---
I have not noticed.  I can delete and rebuild things with no apparent loss of camp budget.  I still have the boost from the patch 7 changes. 
---
Thank you. I have an AAE 50 cal borrowed to a friend now.
---
Well,.. he is drunk ...
---
Would you like 6k?
---
There are multiple spawns for instruments that are junk, I feel like they shoul have been part of the recipes At least... it really doesn’t make sense why they even made them an item.
---
I beat that quest completely by accident on my umpteenth try. Timer glitched and I survived just long enough to finish it. 
---
I'll do 6k. GT KolathDragon. Prolly won't be on until late afternoon pdt
---
Why is wine made from tarberries instead of mutfruit? I can think of only two places tarberries grow, it's pointless to make wine.
---
I didnt get it the first two times and I was just in the nuke zone, on my third attempt I caught the warhead with my face (right on the nuclear symbol on the map) and got it.
---
Why tho what?
---
How much for the shotgun
---
 I kill him on a regular basis. He shows up on my trip from the Mire to The Whitespring quite a lot. 
---
 If you don't always fast travel your odds go up a lot. He's out there. ;)
---
You can wear all other clothing over armor.
---
I’m more disappointed in the server stability since the last patch, wish they would’ve tested the servers a little more because it definitely feels like a step in the wrong direction, and all for what? An owl mask and a sausage recipe? Definitely not worth the multiple SBQ disconnections I and many others have been experiencing as of late.
---
YMMV then, I tried it a few days ago and still got the overencumbered message
---
Well then I can say what I want too
---
I was doing this but couldn't get even close to 76 cranberry moonshine to drink while listening to the radio...
---
I don’t have one If u read the sod it’s it says is anyone selling a shotgun 
---
Okay, you're right about that.
---
The golf course is open, must have been a bug, but for 2 days now on several servers I cant get into West Tek... I dont have an alt character.
---
Weird.  I was having issues with disconnects and game performance yesterday until I reset everything including my router.   
---
This sounds different though.
---
Ahahaha, that was funny
---
Alright, let me know when you’re online :)
---
Before adjustment I was at max, post patch I built a turret, couple lights, some railings, food and the two new crafting stations. I was amazed at how much. Now I'm nowhere close to that. Who knows. 
---
Glad to read you're not a jerk in game. Stating the obvious here, but the definition of griefing is subjective. 
---
One thing most will agree on, is public workshops ARE PvP areas. The OP motivation wasn't to debate whether it's PvP or not, but HOW it's PvP. Being capable of stealing another's workshop FROM STEALTH WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING THE WORKSHOP is absolutely ridiculous. Don't you think??
---
Sure thing
---
Definitely feel violated. Am looking into cameras that don't require contracts. and I'm on the other side, in KY. And I will be filing a claim. And I'll have to do some digging for pictures. I had just gotten several games for Christmas and a few more after taxes.
---
Door was definitely locked, they broke the frame and knocked the side off. No deadbolt, it's an old farmhouse door. It's got a big glass window in it too. I think they picked our hose cause we didn't have cars in the driveway, they hit a few other houses too. And it is just stuff, but it still sucks. I'm sorry about your home, I can't imagine losing everything at once. Hardest part for me is I can't relax. I just want to kick my feet up for a bit and play my new fallout game and I can't. I certainly am glad they didn't hurt our pets. That is a worry since our dog is an 80lb German Shepard. She was in her crate and couldn't get out though. And you're fine, I appreciate talking to someone about this. It's why I made the post. 
---
Maybe tarberries resemble grapes more? 
---
I found 1 plan in Blackwater mine by where the boss mole miner spawns. This was a couple weeks before the last patch but still after they took them out of the vendors list. I think they’re just a random rare spawn, good luck!
---
Stand up... there you go. You were dreaming. What's your name?
---
1. If all the robots survive you get a mask.
---
2. recipes/plans/beret are in the same loot pool with an even chance to get any 1 of them.
---
3. List of all the possible rewards here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3ghvv/dataminer\_here\_list\_of\_all\_fasnacht\_rewards\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3ghvv/dataminer_here_list_of_all_fasnacht_rewards_and/)
---
4. No one has confirmed anything like that making a difference, just more surviving bots means higher chance of getting a mask.
---
Its ok not to like it but its a Cool feature for some. Maybe they will add a drug dealer dlc next and we can carft meth... Lol.
---
When did the world become such a huge bitch? You took to Reddit to complain about teenagers being condescending towards you about a game? Jesus Christ let it go. Remarkably insecure. 
---
So the interloper is pretty much cthulu controlled by some ancient dude with giant metal faces
---
Yes, because it's so much fun for everyone when bullies win. Fucking hate bullying behaviors. I'd love to see you take over my real life workshop. Bring it.
---
I’ve seen bloodied builds dominate, but I’ve also seen power armor builds dominate. Most important thing is knowing how to play your build to maximize your strengths, and like you said exploit your enemies weaknesses. 
---
Any event, location, or area in the Cranberry Bog. I used to say the Three Ws: Whitesprings, Watoga, and West Tek, but you can just live in the Bog and be attacked by 3s enemies at your base. I literally just walked around to the areas where multiple enemies spawn, and found maybe 5-7 3 star enemies. My best drop ever was on that day last week. It was an Explosive Junkies 10mm pistol with vats costs 15% less
---
And judging from the massive amounts of upvotes my post recieved already I think not many people are as bugged by it as I am.
---
Ah wel, wont stop me from playing ofcourse.
---
Everyone would be playing [this](https://youtu.be/eZ2Yfwgtptw) 24/7
---
Yea, I'm not sure how much it covers though, if I've met any minimums. I have changed my password though and my progress should be saved. So it's mostly just a matter of getting everything picked up again and buying new things.

I have weird audio issues if I start any other programs that use audio before launching Fallout.   I am assuming you tested this with no discord launched (and removed from launching a startup?)

Combat Knives. Try em' you will like them. They benefit quite a lot from 200% repair.

 My Nocturbal 40% Speed one hits at 180 when its at night and hits 4 or 5 times a sec. Just my Serrated Combat Knife, no star one I made gets to 130 and is generally devastating.

Great! Found the plan at the first try!
---
I am looking for the red varient version on PS4. Is that from the recruitment blues quest?
---
Tried that, started walking down the road from Flatwoods and made it to Camden Park via the Nuka-Cola plant.
---
No dice :(
---
Moreover just realised that I cannot trigger 'Cop a Squatter' in Watoga either.
---
What I can do however is magically develop Glowing Pustules is I stand still long enough. Today is a very peculiar day.
---
Another fellow redditor in a different thread suggested walking around the Ash Heap, apparently it triggered for him whilst wandering around doing Battle Bot so I shall try.
---

Ding ding ding. 
---
Had an instigating swing speed with reduced weight Deathclaw guantlet drop there, doesn't matter that it's one tier lower it's great for farming legendaries
---
So what about people who, seeing the advertisement Photos, wanted to collect them ?  I enjoyed the parade a lot but now why should i grind for ? already have all plans recipes beret and 5 non common masks  
---
I am doing the Event like I am Gambling tbh
---
Yup
---
Was the skeleton on the wall with the owl mask and the megasloth claws? That also doesn't mean anything considering this dlc could have been planned from the beginning. 
---
They said they are looking into implementing something to do with our unused ammo.

Before adjustment I was at max.  Afterward I had almost 30% available budget and then built 10 turrets and a bunch of stuff to max it again. 
---
Yesterday I remodeled and delete some things and 6 turrets.  Expanded a new building, lights, and farm.  New Faschnacht plans.  Maxed again.  No loss or change in max budget.  
---
Great! GT is IMMORTALP74, I'll be on later
---
Damn
---
It probally called for some prewar grain and that is the closest substitute? 
---
No real good answer

Just like irl lol
---
Budget increases with level.
---
I wouldn’t mind the Core drain but I absolutely hate the AP drain. C’mon, Chameleon exists, why does the stealthboy mod have to have not one, but two large negatives associated with it.
---
Me neither. My 2 nukashines from the initial quest are still sitting in my fermenter. 
---
I'll eventually force myself to do the biv recipe quests so I can get them all, but otherwise, *meh*.
---
Well considering that nukashine uses nuclear material as an ingredient, it's not that outlandish to assume that people managed to mutate regular wheat pre-war. 
---
Maybe all these mutated plants were created/discovered pre-war, and when the nukes dropped only these were hardy enough to survive the nuclear winter and the fallout.
---
A more plausible theory is that bethesda simply didn't think about it.
---
Just because Bethesda may read it does not mean everyone else wants to. Send them your gripes directly
---
Are you serious? That would mean the world to me. Like seriously, I can't believe someone would do that for me. I'm just a stranger on the internet. All I had was a first gen Xbox, so if you are for real I would be so happy. I really can't believe this. Thank you. Something good happening to make this a bit more normal. I live in KY, would you need me to help with shipping?
---
I deleted the program itself when I quit playing another game a while ago. I used the browser version for the chat session.
---
I tried restarting the game without it or anything else open and it changes nothing. 
---
One spawns just behind my CAMP in the Ash Heap but everytime I get close to it, it disappears.

---
I heard Fallout 4 may be like Fallout 76. You can have plenty of camp space
---
I keep hearing of him, but what does he sell that is so worth it? 
---
I also have a TSE lever with all mods on them. I can craft both lever and handmade so it’s easy to learn all mods for it.
---
Anything that ignores 50% of your opponent’s DR means more bang bang for your buck in my book.  No need to be at low health, have certain perks, etc...
---
No, and no one knows the detail yet.
---
I really wasn't fishing. I just wanted to talk and have some support. I don't have many friends and I don't keep in good contact with them where I've moved away from them. This is just really hard and I wanted someone to talk to. 
---
i'm just farming some coal but I have everything else now. Let me know when a good time is for you :)
---
Also, because tone doesn't translate in texts - that was a challenge of jest with a point. In games, it's too easy for people to be asshats to one another. IRL there are consequences. As someone who kicked bullies asses back in the day, methinks few deserve consequences of intervention more than they. They are a sad lot indeed.
---
Yes for gods sakes!
---
Shops open and I’m here!
---
I bought the power armor edition too and they were late shipping it so they sent me a code for the game free so I just sold the bundle unopened for 300. They paid me to play fallout 76.
---
Okay, added you. :)
---
Wow, not good.   The only issue I had last night was that I stopped hearing area chat for a few minutes on one of the servers, during the parade event.  It started working a few minutes later, so I assume it was just the usual weirdness with their servers sometimes.  The next server hop - no issues.

What about brewing don’t you like ? What’s there to not like ?

The camp items can be previewed under wall decor, floor decor, and misc structures, they include confetti for the floor, balloons, streamers, mounted flag etc, the rare plan seems to be the bonfire which a reddit subscriber had twice in 60 runs of the event. There are two recipes one is for sausage and one is a doughnut, some people get lots of doughnuts but no sausages and for others it’s the other way around, I’ve had the doughnut recipe twice in 28 runs but never the sausage.  The only pattern I’ve observed in the masks dropping and this is probably just pure coincidence so take with a pinch of salt is that when there’s only 3 of us doing the event I get the toothy mask every time, 4 or 5 I get the soldier mask, when there’s 6 or more I get the other common masks. The jobs you do don’t seem to matter or quantity, I once did 4 out of the 5 tasks before others showed up but still had a common mask, the only weapons I’ve used are a fire axe, handmade and combat shotgun so I can’t comment on the cryolator but I doubt it has an effect. With regard to luck it’s dependant on real life luck more than S.P.E.C.I.A.L luck as I have a base of 12 luck and I’ve tried topping that up with iguana soup (+3) bobble head, happy go lucky perk with alcohol and day tripper (can’t remember what that all adds up to) but that hasn’t made any difference at all. 
---
I found him in watoga. He spawns everywhere it seems.
---
Well said. I just ignore the idiots and childish keyboard warriors

That’s the fletcher mod
---
  I really cant believe I never though of it like this.  I'm getting older and its taken me 30 years to realize that a reaction a lot of the time is all ppl want, the guy who keeps his cool, composed, clowns the clown.  Then if it gets too bad throw an unexpected right hook (learned in 11 years the only fair fight is the one you loose)

Ding, ding, ding, ding! YOU are correct. This is why it seems more like griefing than true PvP, wherein all participants agree to engage.

Nope, I can say what I want. If ya don’t like it, don’t read it
---
Same, and thanks Im glad you like it
---
Because 76 is a prime example of what is wrong with the game industry.  It may not be the best example, it may not even be the latest example, but it hits so many hotspots that it will take years to change opinion.
---
So, let's see a short list of hot button items:
---
1.  A slightly improved asset flip.  Most of the art in 76 is rehashed.  There is some unique art, but a lot of rehash from 4 and 3.
---
2.  Rushed to market without proper testing/fixes.  This is a big one.  The beta had bugs galore, those bugs almost all made it to live servers on release.
---
3. Online only service without proofing for cheat/exploits.  I hate to use it, but imagine Fortnite if you could just duplicate every item.  It would have killed them.  Saving grace for 76 is that many players want to play co-op.
---
4. No Balance for PVP.  Got a bloodied build?  One shot everyone in PVP.  Meanwhile, noobs just get frustrated.  What's worse about this, is that when combined with the lack luster art, the horrible testing and the relative lack of new features; what exactly was the team doing?  Apparently just figuring out how to build a world out of matchsticks of Fallout 4.
---
5. Crashes.  Left and right on release.  Did you take a workshop?  Enjoy it for the next 15 minutes, because after that you are likely DC'd.
---
6.  Bugs.  Hey, did you pick up loot that someone dropped?  Did you find (x) grenades in a locker?  You are fucked.  Those grenades counted against your weight because someone duped them and left them for you.  Fun!
---
7.  Griefing.  Slap damage?  Slap damage was essentially a tool to help noobs from being harassed.  It didn't work.  Soon as someone got a bloodied drill they would hang out at flatwoods and follow someone until they hit level 5 and... You know the rest.
---
8.  The story was hidden.  Worse yet, the story tellers we're faceless and lifeless.  There really is something about iconic characters that drives storytelling.  I can mention Handsome Jack and Claptrap to any gamer and they immediately have an opinion.  76 lacks any meaningful story teller (I personally liked Rose, but still, that was miniscule compared to the depth of 76)
---
9.  76 is just Fallout 4.5 online.  It is probably a boon to people that liked 4, but for people that felt 4 missed the mark it's literally more of the same with more constraints.  Less buildable space, less conversation (4 conversations we're terribad.  I guess if you can't make a conversation have impact may as well get rid of them.). Assets are the same, most of the code is the same and this game may as well just be a fully modded Skyrim.
---
10.  My personal favorite.  No agency.  An RPG without a single meaningful choice.  Fucking awesome.  I'd say go back to the original and 2 for an example of good agency, but you don't even need to go back that far.  See fallout 4.  What faction did you side with?  Now, in 76, what faction did you side with?  No agency.  Bad design.  Fucking rookie design.
---

Oh my god

You're here so you haven't given up all hope. I hope you complete the challenge to play it again churrr
---
Has to be worth a try 👍
---
Lol, you just reminded me that that parade leader is holding a flute and trumpet if I’m not mistaken, I wonder if they’re going to add those as new instruments.
---
We’ll see how it works but I have a feeling this new bounty system is gonna get abused beyond belief in the first week. If someone slaps a bounty on me I’ll just have my friend meet me at a location and have him claim it. But i guess we’ll find out more next week.
---
I appreciate the tip but but I’ll looking for thousands of asap 
---
I used the normal harpoon too, it had terrible range also.
---
Simmer 
---
Ah I wish a serverhop would fix it. I'm not an expert with computers but to me it just sounds like me opening Discord either made a 1 out of a 0 or a 0 out of a 1 that it wasn't supposed to. Or my crappy processor got overloaded or something?
---
What are the benefits of those recipes? 
---
Esp since "...just tell your old pal Biv E. Ridge"
---
The bug is due to this exact scenario. 
---
You purchased a less than half finished product that has, since launch, been a broken 1,000,000 piece jigsaw puzzle and are for some very strange and ignorant reason, confused about a single bug in the game?
---
In the midst of millions of bugs, you wonder why this bug is present?
---
Because you bought a bug in the form of a disc or digital download app. 76 is a bug, plague and many other bads.
---
The reason for this happening is because it is fallout76. That is exactly why.
---
I appreciate the tip but I’m looking for thousands of it asap 
---
So, the Harpoon is actually a projectile with drop, not a hitscan bullet like many guns. The flechette mod DRAMATICALLY reduces it’s range, I think due to the drop interaction- anything beyond about 10 feet you have to start aiming higher and higher. 40 feet away? You have to aim high enough that your gun will obscure your target.  
---
Flechette is great as a short range CQB shotgun though, because you end up with unlimited ammo (each shot spawns between 0 and like 5 harpoons on the body. As long as you loot, you’ll gain more ammo than you use.)
---
Oh its got holes (most of which were previously mentioned, rads, staggered, etc)
---
its not invulnerable by any means (which is obv a good thing) its just waaaaaaaay better for damage mitigation than base resist could ever hope for.
---
Will prob have to wait until tomorrow for our showdown. Super late getting off work and the kiddo needs me right now. No gaming for me today. Sorry. (I'm legit considering taking my rig to work tonight though)
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
Nope, it’s just a sound effect. 
---
I found a opossum spawn I didn't know existed thanks to that stuff. They seem to move around though.
---
Walk more, best way to find it. If you start hearing some funky sounds, or start seeing a pinkish aura around mobs in the woods, it will be somewhere around. 
---
It's going to be hard for anyone to hold it for you, it either attacks immediately, or teleports away.
---
Guess I've been lucky? I've killed 3 and had 1 run away. 2 of them were in the same general area NW of Watoga, one was in the woods around R&amp;G station. They've all been in/near wooded areas for me.
---
Ap regen.
---
But every clothing item does go over armor, so, yknow.
---
Anti-epidemic? Accept the cure? I have no idea what you’re talking about
---
No vertibot 
---
What system are you playing on?
---
WHO?
---
I’m not completely bashing it. I get the missions done so fast b4 and after fermenting.  It’s ok, just was expecting more from the updates I guess and got a little disappointed 
---
The most likely answer is they were unbanned by accident so rebanned soon afterwards when this was fixed
---
PACIFIST MODE =/= NO PVP
---
Yeah i thought SBQ was going to be guaranteed good loot but twice i didnt get anything.  
---
No idea.   Hopefully someone else can chime in. 
---
I have that to
---
Not the Atomium, then. That one you can walk inside. 
---
But not all were rebanned 
---
Here's my comment on your reddit post and a thumbs up.. here's my youtube like and a comment as well.. here's my appreciation for your hard work! Take it all!! :D

Do you know what artificial sweetener is or how it’s made? Why is there no Diet Nuka in this game.

And what exactly do you think they're going to about you not liking it?

Yes the AP drain is insane, it’s like they simply don’t want people to use PA.

has anyone found a use for spoiled brahman milk
---
I like the uv idea. That would be useful at the queen.
---
Sheesh with my bloodied I only do 1k damage. Even still I thought passive dampens a lot of damage and how did they circumvent being wanted if you weren't in a party or had a workshop, unless you hit them once which allowed them to fight back without penalty.
---
This is so true.  I had a sweet super sledge and sledgehammer one star legendary. And then recently upgraded to an instigating 3 star baseball bat.  The bat does work on full health compared to anything. But sure I’d rather have the same legendary of a super sledge any day.  Obviously. 
---
Do you understand the difference between a player and a vendor?
---
I know, right? The mouth harp can be found at the Sons of Dane mead, I mean beer hall. There’s a few other locations too but I can’t think of them off the top of my head. 
---
No mods.
---
Yea, I just was mainly using it as a box to keep important papers in. I didn't expect it to ever have to be used for its intended purpose. Not in an area prone to fires, but do live in a 70 yo house. I guess I need to plan for the worst more.
---
Try eating it as eating things unlocks plans sometimes
---
I know it is today, wondering about time etc
---
I'm not skilled in game design so I'm not going to agree with labeling so many things as arbitrary and poorly implemented.  Just because Im not aware of the details doesn't make it arbitrary 
---
That said, things keep getting better in the game and they have to prioritize what gets fixed, but I enjoy building as much as exploring and I hope they continue to improve the CAMP system and implement ideas like yours.
---
I have about 180 hours in the game, only encountered him once.
---
No answers yet but if it means we can trade a few useless 1 stars for a good 3 star id love it. 
---
Not every time but did get it once after patch.
---
I agree. People get really offended when you say something negative about this game. I know a lot of people don't wanna hear something negative about a game that they spent 60 bucks (or even more) on. But the thing is, this game is far from perfect and still not in a state that it would be considered a full 60 Dollar AAA release if it was from any other developer than Bethesda. Bethesda getting backlash from the players can only be good for the players. Because they have to realize that they have to do better in this day and age of gaming. We all love fallout and we all wanna enjoy one of our favourite franchises. Criticism is needed for this game as much as the game needs this lovely dedicated player base. Because we show them, that the game isn't a lost cause and the critics are needed to show what would bring players back or even new players on board. We are all in the same boat and shouldn't attack each other because in the end we all want the same. A Fallout that is up to nowadays standarts because we love this franchise to death.
---
She’s always there when I got to farm springs so maybe she just bugged for you that one time, pretty sure it’s a set spawn no matter the quest.
---
How do you get that much technical data every day?
---
Weird, if it was a trade steal exploit, I bet it is still working since its not well known and would be hard for Bethesda to replicate then patch. Scary, hope it doesn't work on player vending; imagine selling stuff and all your stuff is stolen without getting a single cap and since its a vending machine you got no player to record and report on.
---
I remember back in the day when I use to use extractors for gaining resources 
---
Ummm.... ok.
---
That absolutely. During the fight I never have the time to loot the dozens of scorched I killed, then afterwards it’s next to impossible to locate them which is ridiculous. 
---
Lucky you.  Turned in my last 40 plus and no new paints for me.  Sucks, I roleplay as BOS too!
---
You can find 3452231789 tubas in West Virginia but not a single flute or trumpet.
---
Well, one place is a bunch in the pools behind the Aggrecultral center in Flatwoods.  So it’s not exactly hard to find.  
---
Someone might have destroyed the turrets before he got there so he might not realize they are there.
---
Well thank you very much 
---
Hey, I’m not the only one that was a bit disappointed in the last 2 updates. I also have more pull than u think with Bethesda. I contact them privately and then I speak my piece on hear to see how other people think. So if ya don’t like what I have to say, don’t read it. Public forum, I can say what I want
---
Havent experianced a single bug in the game, so yknow, youre probably one of those people who watched a youtube video and hopped on the hate train.
---
The single foundation with stairs is the easiest to move camps, but in all honesty I don't like it. I used to do this, but I did get fed up with it.
---
Now if I move camp I'll just build a new one. Which makes a bit more sense to me as often what suits one location wont suit another. Plus I enjoy building them, seeing what I can come up with each build.
---
No kidding I’m right there with you I have about 230+ put in and I’ve literally seen it twice. TWICE! lol 😂 
---
Yeah biv's brain is kind of stuck on whatever rant he's on.
---
FYI, I'm lv 160 and assaultrons still make my butthole pucker when I hear her voice. I'd rather fight a lv 85 scorchbeast &amp; mirelurk queen at the same time than a lv 46 assaultron.
---
Nope, in a latest fight I spent thousands of ultracite rounds and all I got was four ultracite armor schematics which I already known all of them. 
---
That's what we figured. We didn't want her to be hurt.
---
Is it only in a certain area ppl run into it?
---
sorry dude not yet. still waiting for the Mrs to pick up the kids. 
---
Thanks. I needed a good laugh. 
---
Only one mod at a time, I've got a few modified torsos ready to swap out depending on what activity I plan on doing.
---
Thanks. I'll try. 
---
Smoke on the Water or Enter Sandman, more likely. 
---
I saw a kid wearing a fo76 hat when I was out playing airsoft one day. I mention it, and he immediately returns with how much the game sucks... like fuck dude, why wear it then?
---
I don't understand. 
---
 I have a complete set of BoS Heavy with Strengthened Limbs and a Dense Chest. That took 50 hours. The Legendary bits I run now were added over time.
---
 You can't even come close to paying for it! I make money  steadily as I move around and its unusual for me to have less than 2500 caps as I might come across a thing I want.
---
So many people complain and whine about fallout, they miss out on the fun like this. This is a huge part of what makes 76 so much fun. Creativity, community and fun. 
---
If they allowed us to combine camps between 4-6 friends imagine what concepts we could all come up? 
---
Nice camp guy
---
230+ hours I’ve spent and found and killed it. Literally just seen moth man the other day and tbh he put up a decent fight.
---
Whatever dude
---
May 23rd on the roadmap
---
It's coming May 23rd, not March 23rd.
---
Youtube the fallout radio stations from each game. A playlist will pop up for each
---
Have you got evidence that Bethesda admitted that not everyone that got banned was guilty? Cause I haven't heard them say anything. 
---
Everyone that was first banned got an email, within the email Bethesda said they would unban them after an update. They also said “this is you’re only warning, future bans will be permanent and without notice. Please take this time to read the Terms and Conditions you agreed to before playing this game.”
---
It doesn’t matter how much you paid to play fo76 or any other game, you’re buying a license to have access to play the game and that can be revoked at anytime per the terms and conditions of the contract you agreed to at the start of the game. 
---
It's a copycat recipe. You try to make it similar to what they had prior to all this happening. 
---
Id happily have the plans than the 10 .38 rounds and 12 .45 rounds i got. Hahaha
---
You did the humane thing
---
What I noticed is, sometimes if you’re entering within a few minutes of loading into the game it’s worse, and wandering a bit reduces chances, but that might just be my experience. 
---
iron clad rank 5, lone wanderer rank 4, assasins+sentinal armor full set. plus the level disparity armor/damage buff for attacking higher level players. learn to do math.... the reason we can dominate you is bc we are smarter. also you cant "hack" a game where the player stat interactions are server side checks. dunce 
---
Nice Fridge Logic.
---
Probably for the same reasons as Jet being pre-war in FO4.
---
They messed up/RetCon
---
Thank you. My wife's PayPal is Acrossthestrawberry@yahoo.com. You really don't have to donate if you don't want to. That wasn't why I created this post but the love from this community has been just overwhelming and I am forever I'm your all's debt. 
---
I've come across 1 about every 100 hours or so. He won't generally be visible when he shows up. You'll be out in the woods at night having a walkabout but then there's a low wubwubwubwubwub sound and an eerie purple glow and he'll be around somewhere. Sometimes he'll VOOMP and disappear when you take a shot at him. Sometimes he'll fight and frankly he's... Not that hard. Also his drop is very very very meh.
---
Yes, this!! I mean I literally said in the post that they don't have to like it. If they don't, that's fine! I just don't get why they have to express that to me just because i'm wearing a shirt lol.
---
Lore went into the fucking garbage
---
I don’t know, I encountered one in savage divide.
---
Or lol up fallout on iTunes and Spotify, there’s a ton of user made playlists with all the music 
---
Oh I know! I don’t have nearly enough moonshine, and I don’t have the recipes to craft them, so I’m going for the other three challenges. 
---
Look up the news articles about the guy who had 900+ hours and got banned for having too much stuff and then after all the media coverage Bethesda finally looked into it and unbanned him because hos stuff was legit. Its easy to find om Google.
---
You have a full set of Bolstering Bos heavy combat armor? 
---
It seems like part of the mode includes how long you go without getting killed, so that may factor in as well.  Depends on what you get for surviving.  As you said, we'll find out next week.  
---
Have this issue with my camp too
---
Lame excuse for a lore fuck up. How hard would it have been for the devs to just put Wheat instead of Razorgrain? 
---
I found mine yesterday, already look like a flamingo sanctuary. On xbox if you need someone to build them for you.
---
They said random Aid items will drop on death in survival.
---
Maybe it's a bug that's carried over, like the mode select screen/sheepsquatch invasion, etc?
---
Sorry but you’re wrong. Try actually reading the Terms and Conditions of FO76. 
---
You’re buying a license to play the game and can have that license revoked permanently at anytime for violating the terms. 
---
It’s not a hard concept. 
---
You have set up near a random spawn point.
---
The note is for a very basic quest to find a crappy weapon
---
Thank you guys!
---
The way my perks are I take less damage when not in a team (lone wanderer). I know I can switch out some perk cards but I’d rather not waste the time if I don’t know the person or feel like teaming up at the time. I’ll usually accept the invite for a couple minutes just Incase they want a free fast travel but then I leave.
---
I mean, even if someone is wearing a fortnite shirt I'm not going to go over to them and say "hey fortnite sucks!" LOL... i don't have any kind of reason to be that rude!!! But yeah I hear you LOL &gt;&gt;
---
German efficiency
---
It's unusual for me to have less than 5000 caps. I have full cap quantity now even. I have a full set of sentinel Assassins Bos armor, some awesome guns, all the junk in the world and ammo. 
---
To my knowledge, it's before Lent every year, if that helps any for next year.
---
I'd like hanging picture frames, but we already have the photo gallery for a scrap book/collection.
---
A companion needs to be able to be killable. 
---
I wonder if the bounty carries over to adventure mode? That could be one way to circumvent the survival aspect . But yeah we’ll just have to wait and see, I’m hopeful for something fun.
---
It is a perk card
---
Well nazis designed more than just guns that still used many places
---
But I know MG42 is a sweet gun. One of the highest rates of fire in its class. So I can see those sticking around.  Lugers were used before WW2 but still good question you make 
---
Yes vertibot!!!!
---
Gotta go with the Union Uniform with Military helmet, green bandana and bottle cap sunglasses
---
Yes it can be revoked but only if you break the terms of service. The terms of service do,not say "dont obtain 100,000+ items in 30 days" that initself is possible without duplicating. Look uo the player with 900+ hours played that Bethesda had to unban because of all the media coverage when he was innocent. 
---
I did say that it's okay if they don't like it though, but it still doesn't mean they should go to me and tell me how much they hate it just because i'm wearing a shirt LOL
---
This. Awesome idea I love it. Also refrigerators. With these I might actually grow / hunt food again. Right now I eat a steady diet of canned dog food. 
---
I boycotted the game at first. I felt that 60 bucks for a game that’s not even playable is ridiculous. And all the other nonsense after release made me want to hate it. 
---
But I just purchased it for 20 bucks last weekend and I’m loving it. I feel 20 bucks is what this game is worth. If had paid 60 I definitely would not be getting my monies worth. I think a lot of people don’t want to fall for the hype of this game and feel cheated. But if you purchase it for a reasonable price it’s totally worth it.
---
I personally have only dropped a server 2 times. But the lag while exploring is kinda annoying. But I’m sure all the kinks will be worked out eventually.
---
Heard it can be a legendary, but then it would just be a crappy legendary
---
I think I'll start being more obsessive about documenting things now. I'm glad they left the old stuff. With depreciation they wouldn't be worth anything but the progress and memories and just what we could have lost is crazy to think about. We could have lost so much more physically, and then there are our pets too. Im so grateful they didn't try and feed them bleach on the way out or something. 
---
sweet thx
---
You are actually wrong and here is why: 
---
Yes it can be revoked but only if you break the terms of service. The terms of service do not say "dont obtain 100,000+ items in 30 days" that initself is possible without duplicating. Look up the player with 900+ hours played that Bethesda had to unban because of all the media coverage when he was innocent. 
---
Not sure. Personally, I’m guessing you turn in a legendary (and maybe some caps/resources) and can get a re-roll on the legendary effects.  Maybe costs scales with number of stars
---
A few months ago I went into a local game store to pick something up, and made a comment about 76's woes to one of the employees during casual conversation at checkout. I guess the dude thought I was bashing 76 and so he started to talk to me about some big issue destroying the game, like he thought it was funny... it was actually a BS post on reddit that was disproven before the guy even started to blab. He hadn't fact-checked or followed up on what he read, just started disseminating it to customers. I had to roll my eyes at that one and left him to his fallacy party.  xD
---
My thoughts on this:
---
Make a Doghouse Workshop item, where it creates a CAMP defender dog, similar to the Brahmin Fertilizer. We get a dog, no extra companion code/nonsense, and we can officially start the Legend of Dogmeat.
---
It's an okey mutation for melee-builds I'd say. 
---
That's why I put all my junk in stash and add weapons or aid. Can't drop it if I don't have it.
---
I don't think there's a secret ending.
---
I don't think there's even a normal ending.
---
I've been to Fasnacht (Fasching) parties before, though when I was a kid living in Germany. I didn't know what it was at the time, and 76 helped me finally understand a bit more of my childhood. Heh. So I was kind of excited to see what was going down in Helvetia.
---
I'll definitely try to check it out. Seems interesting, and I like the fact 76 gives tribute to the lil' town in a quasi-accurate way. 
---
haha only in-game though 😅
---
Evidently he made quite the splash nearby. The let out a it think an elementary school early cause he hit a house nearby. Or at least thats what I've heard through the grapevine. 
---
Yeah. He's a walking internet commenter, and she's not the most game-savvy person so she listens to whatever he says. I'm surprised she likes Fallout 4 so much considering he's right in there with the New Vegas circlejerk crowd.
---
Ugh.
---
I respect other people’s opinions and am sorry that so many kids are having their learning experiences disrupted, but honestly don’t understand why so many people feel that bullying in school is such an issue, and I almost feel like kids should try to just grow thicker skin.  Why not try to understand that bullying is part of life?  It can be fun... kind of like on television where the kid learns to stand up for themself.  If it becomes too much, it isn’t hard to change schools or learn at home.  I mean, it’s an institution with developing humans going through hormonal changes... you should expect to come across more unstable children than rational ones, to be honest...
---
That would be great, thanks!
---
We won’t know for sure until we try. 
---
Awesome! On my way now.
---
Do you happen to have a recording or YouTube gameplay?
---
Is it one of these APM tracks?
---
amazon.com/Music-Featured-Fallout-Various-artists/dp/B07L6TKZ8S
---
That's true. Best of luck.
---
Do you have fertilizer? 
---
Yeah but the one at Watoga you need to talk to to trigger quest , and it doesnt work :/ hope for a fix soon 
---
Good point.  The bounty should totally be locked to survival.  I'm overall looking forward to it.  Debating if I want to bring my sniper over, or start fresh.  
---
Another thing to keep in mind is its tagged as BETA, so hopefully the devs will be keeping a close eye on these types of issues and adjusting as needed. 
---
Pre-war America was really hyperfocused on weaponry, and also history to an extent. You can see advertisements in some train stations for laser weapons aimed at average consumers. I could also imagine historical museums were scavenged for weapons early
---
Thank you very much for your appreciation and for encouraging me. It's very kind of you. 😊
---
Ikr? They left the room temp ones. Got a 24 pack of khaos from Amazon cause it's my favorite flavor and I drink them for a little kick in the morning cause I'm not a big coffee drinker. And they left the ones next to the fridge, but took the cold ones. Found that this morning.
---
You can get cloud storage really cheaply, I started scanning or photoing all reciepts and invoices, etc..
---
So much easier to look in "2018"/"specific date/item, than flipping through folders of papers. And it's safe from hard drive failure, theft, or damage.
---
One, you just responded to a three week old comment so you're a lunatic. Two, did you even read the comment I was responding to? My point was directly related to that person's comment.
---
that guy got a reban also... not sure if he was ever unbaned due to the reason you said. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b38vee/900_hours_guy_482000_login_failed_this_account_is/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Is it one of these APM tracks from Amazon? The auto mod is not letting me post the direct link.

It being boarded up is how that area loads in. It will eventually show up ime. 
---
When I had a crash during a biv quest and it did the same thing it let me pick up another whole new quest from biv.
---
Yep. I'm about the same hours of game played and I've only seen two as well.
---
Now that there are increased spawns for rare junk, you’re going to have to resort to ambushing mules.  R.I.P.
---
I MEAN.. you aren't wrong at all LOL. 
---
What I'm hoping is a system similar to master work cores in destiny 2 you get a legendary sell it to him for a legendary shard or something and then with like 5 shards you can reroll a gun/armor of your choice 
---
And you get upvoted 😂 what a world.
---
&gt;You will be a lot happier if you cease to let what other people think impact you.
---
Yeah, super relevant. 
---
Thank you. I didn't want to at first cause I didn't want to beg for money, just talk. But the support has been so overwhelming. I can't believe it.
---
Damnit I wish I saw this yesterday after dropping 900 on serums lol spent all my caps, oh well
---
Good to know, so weird tho, I wonder if we are in a minority having not encountered it or if it’s a lot of ppl
---
I think it's one thing to shit on it and another to go out of your way to find someone wearing merch to shit on it LOL. But hey i'm glad you enjoy it!!!! :) That's awesome!!
---
Thank you. You too. Inventory what you have and tell your loved ones how you feel. 
---
I agree. I'm also looking forward to build a huge combined camp with my friends. Hope it happens sooner rather than later.
---
And thanks.
---
How about another tea Pops? And you can tell me about the war.
---
I think the idea is more to have something other players can look at. I like the idea, it would be a blast looking through people's albums!
---
Thank you. I can't believe how much everyone has helped.
---
The 900 hour guy wasn't innocent, and no amount of Googling has revealed he was ever unbanned. Sounds like misinformation.
---
Wow, but that shows that he was unabnned because he was innocent once already. How many poeple are being denied service to a game they paid for when all they did was play a lot?
---
I’ll be here next time!
---
Sounds good I’ll add you and remember next time
---
Also his body eventually turns into a meat pile, wait for it to despawn and you should be able to look his meat pile
---
Check the other guys comment
---
Done. 
---
You’re welcome. 
---
Isn't it only available in the atom store ? Pretty sure tbh
---
Look, whether you like it or not, Bethesda has every right to ban people from *their* game of they think the ToS has been broken. And you arguing about it won't change that.
---
As for the 900 hours dramaqueen, if you had bothered to check, you would realize that he was indeed banned, then unbanned on accident like everyone else, and then banned again.
---
No one forced Bethesda to unban him - in fact, he is still out.
---
System? 
---
I really really hope we’ll get a whole bunch more holiday events in the futurs. Fasnacht Day is really fun
---
Well fallout needs to nerf these armours and sets somehow otherwise pvp is just useless for the people who didn’t spend money on eBay or PayPal for god armour lol for real, I have no interest in PVP knowing there’s so maaaany users with duped weapons and armour. What a slap in the face it would be to those who cheated and spent real money on gear if their stuff gets nerfed lol haha it would be great 
---
Enclave bunker 
---
I got mine from a nuke zone off a scorch, so somewhere there are scorch.
---
Does the Hazmat suit go over armor? I remember it didn't in the beta.
---
 Yeah I play my game and it does not involve buying weapons and armor.
---
 Everyone gets to do what they want but for me this crap ruins the game. so I won't do it. You get to play the game you want of course, i just don't like it much. ;)
---
That's basically how both of the conversations I had went LOL... one was with a coworker so ... like:
---
"Fallout 76..? No. Just No." and I was like "You don't have to like it dude!"
---
the other was someone who was a customer though and he asked me about my shirt and if it was good and i said i enjoyed it and then he started the whole "i heard it was awful so i'll probably never get it" thing and i was like "well some people like it and some people don't. If it's ever on sale it's worth a try!" and he was like "yeah I'm never buying it full price" and i was like "okay cool bro" LOL
---
Even if you disagree with me, apples to oranges, much? 
---
Since it has rad resistance that isnt clothing, its rad armor.
---
Riiiggghhht and Todd Howard has a beer with me every night after work. Beat that!
---
 Personally I enjoy the brewing addition to the game.
---
If you have a decked out handmade and a TSE lever then why would you be asking for advice on what weapons to use. Use what ya got. 
---
1st he was unbanned befoee that.
---
2nd no they cant just ban you on a whim. There are laws for these things which is why the ToS exists and why they are actually "banning" anyone. They cant provide proof that anyone cheated. They would lose in a small claims,court of their case is "he got a lot of items reallt fast" because that doesnt break the Tos and its circumstantial at best.
---
I just got a tick blood drink from the new alcohol stuff and it uses them.  It's the version that gives you x3 of them and they "melee attacks restore health on hit but have a chance of giving you a disease" or some shit :P
---
It doesn't sound like you like anything about the game
---
I walked around the Ash Heap for half an hour-ish, nada. :(
---
for real dog
---
Perks that reduce the weight of junk don't work in your stash.
---
I did. Still sounds like a bunch of crybaby cheater bullshit to me.
---
Woot! Thanks! I didn't know there were subtitles. I just stopped trying to listen.
---
Charleston capital is actually a great place for ghouls. 
---
Pc
---
NP. i had this quest active for like 3 days wasting a ton of bourbon so i completely sympathize
---
I got it finally lol
---
Haven't seen the sloth yet did it like 8 times 
---
If you have bloody mess and smack it, it should explode and become lootable. I've done it a few times
---
Ok. I get it man, youre part of the mob mentality that is too upset about dupers to look at the individual. Have a nice one.
---
Who tf spends real world money on this? 500 hours of grinding got my build to where it is. If you played this game for a while and still don’t have good armor then either your RNG sucks, you don’t know how to farm caps, or you don’t trade. Point being, if you interact with the community it’s easy to find the gear you need without spending real world money and the ones who do are just easy caps anyways cause they think they’re a god when infact there are a lot of good counters to this armor.
---
Oh cool, need help in the silo?
---
I did say it's fine if they don't like it. I don't really care if they hate it, that's fine! I just think it's silly they need to get validation for hating it by going up to someone wearing merch to blab about it LOL
---
Dude, calm down, i miss read the date at the roadmap.. 
---
Yeah man. Your fallout profile should be saved so I wouldn’t worry about that. Hope everything gets sorted bud
---
Yea, missread it...
---
Sure, buddy.......... ;)
---
Keep carrying the torch, my friend! Soon everyone on the internet will know the depths of Bethesda's depravity!
---
You probably have Thru Hiker on.  I believe it counts as food in your inventory
---
Will pm. Thank you.
---
Does cryolator stop them from teleporting? ( VATS )
---
You have to find actual gourds. Theres some in the northeast corner of the map. In one of the bunkers. I cant remember which one. Took me awhile to figure this out too
---
Well while I’m here anyone got any plans for trapper armor?
---
My farm will be rock'in the veggies and jam in it's vending machine.
---
This is true! Fortunately the only place I went to complain about it was here. I don't really care about their opinions at all, I just thought it was rude that they did this just bc i had merch on lol
---
Why do you think Bethesda put a trading feature in an online game? 
---
iTunes look inon sure I purchased a few from fallout 4 ❤️ ..will also buy some from this game u can just type fallout in iTunes 
---
They already do. Bethesda flushed their rep down the toilet way before my post.
---
Yes. It drains their AP bar and won’t let them regenerate AP for some time (even with food/chems).
---
Like I said, they can hate the game and I don't really care at all. I just think it's silly that they did this just because I was wearing merch
---
Found the concern troll.
---
Yeah, no. You are wrong. Just check his profile here on this sub and you will see for yourself that the only time he was unbanned was just recently, when everyone else got accidentally unbanned, and then he was banned again. In fact, he made a second account to keep playing. Check your sources, because boy are they bad.
---
Who says they are banning you "on a whim"? Epxloiting *is* against the ToS. 
---
Look, you are a bit lost here. They don't need to provide proof to anyone. The only ones who need proof to ban you are themselves, and they already have it.
---
Aid items dropped in survival? Lol I kno what I'm not playing
---
And you took to reddit to look for people to bitch about, my dude!
---
there should be no requirement whatsoever to see your loot. it should be part of the base game. end of story.
---
Nice argument you got there. Nothing of value had been added by you to the conversation. 
---
Bloody mess + mr.handy buzz blade or other vfast weapon works really well for this in my experience with it.
---
Sure.  A game about rebuilding society is in no way comparable to our current social situations.  Weird how a control vault with the “best and brightest” has a huge percentage of sociopaths.  In other fallout games, I didn’t have a learning curve of raiders exploiting mechanics or needing a separate set of gear to fight them.  A game being multiplayer is not a free pass to be a sociopath.
---
If i get my hair cut anymore than it is I'll be bald!!!
---
Depends on the legendaries for me. If its explosive, or two shot, or both, id go for the fletchettes. Also depends on what your planning on using it for. Its more of a shotgun with fletchettes, wide spread/short range.
---
Maybe we'll get the trains running!
---
And that's fine to think! I get that people will hate it. The point was that they went out of their way to say this to a person just because they were wearing merch. It's more silly than anything!
---
I'm not lost. The law is above them and they cant deny a service that was paid for without proof. They would lose in small claims court.
---
Huh? And the fasnacht is a German donut to indulge prior to Lent. I wander what other German influences there are?
---
Google photos does free photos, that's what I use right now, and like up to 15 gb of original resolution of photos. But I need to find a way to organize everything. 
---
Lol got 'em xD
---
LOL WHAT IN THE WORLD.... maybe his grandma got it for him and he's wearing it so his parents don't get mad at him LMFAO
---
Yes, way too overestimated.
---
I see lots of high level people dying (especially melee) in nuke zones or having troubles with the SBQ. If they manage to die so easily while i manage to survive without even bothering to use stim packs that often, it means that their gear is worse than mine and my gear isn't that great. 
---
Gimmick one-shot builds won't work very well in survival, currently they work only because the instigator gets to fight on his own terms. For example, yesterday i ran out of fusion cores, took over poseidon, left everything unlocked and went to do the parade. I was dressed in costume and with a crappy gun so i'm not wasting ammo, PA in my inventory. Random dude contests the workshop fast travels to the parade and kills me. Survival mode will hide the player markers so stuff like this will never happen. 
---
Anyway, i'm not a pvp-er at heart but i think i'll try the survival mode. Sure there will be pvp gods running around, but the vast majority of players are just average joes like me, with okay gear.
---
This was going to be my suggestion, theres almost always 3 legendaries in that event. I farmed this event for all my new toons. Gives you a huge headstart
---
Then it should be revive-able later by the owner or something...
---
Thanks!  I’ll keep it in my junk then. 
---
This! Maybe something like a smoker/dryer for jerky/smoked meats to keep them from spoiling. And drying fruits too. Or ya know...a fridge.
---
You are not the only one!
---
I hate killing sloths and usually run away from them unless they are scorched. 
---
Thank you again. 
---
What laws would those be?
---
You have paid for a license to play *their* game. If you break the ToS of that license, you get banned, simple as that.
---
And to whom would they have to provide proof? Like I said, sue them if you think your rights have been denied.
---
Yeah I sort of regret pre-purchasing it sometimes LOL... but only because of the price. Oh well, I got it as a gift anyway! I just happened to also buy it for someone else as a gift so I still paid LOL
---
I would like the ability to go to the Pitt early in its post war history. 
---
It's looking up now thanks to everyone's help.
---
Because the weapon designers are idiots... Mounted german machine guns, of course they should be handheld...
---
It's pretty natural to try and fit in with the vocal majority by appeasing to their opinion. At first you do it because you want to fit in, then you begin to believe wholeheartedly in what you're promoting. I have a friend just like that.. he never played the game, even when it got obviously more refined (half a year later), yet he is still concerned that it's a trash of a game, because it was portrayed as such for the longest of time.
---
So even now, when the game is in a fairly good and playable state, people will still tell you that it's a "shitty, buggy mess of a game, that developers don't care about". The damage has been done, and nothing will fix it - that's the sad truth. There will always be all those negative reviews on the metacritic, for instance this fine gentlemen here with an outstanding taste in games [**DarokPhoenix**](https://www.metacritic.com/user/DarokPhoenix) , who gave this game a solid 1 out of 10, yet "Tom Clancy's The Division 2" deserved his perfect 10/10 score.
---
There's actually a pretty great phrase for this:  
---
*“A wise man changes his mind sometimes, but a fool never. To change your mind is the best evidence you have one.”*
---
*― Desmond Ford*
---
With that being said, don't take the game bashing as a personal insult.. laugh it off and don't try to argue with people, who will probably never be able to form their own opinion about anything in their life.
---
Cheers!
---
I keep saying this. They cant just say you broke them, you have to have actually proken the ToS ehixh requires evidence. Also i am,not banned so i dont need to sue. 
---
Yeah I know canning IRL is boil and can no preservatives but, they are there for the idea as a balancer. 
---
This happened to me my first, and only, two times doing the event. Stopped after that because it pissed me off. Good to know if I try again I might actually be able to get something out of it. 
---
Lol... everytime I did this the final boss was a mega sloth.
---
I respectfully disagree. In my purist role playing game philosophy, as long as there is a plausible in-game explanation for characters acting crazy (and if game mechanics allow for it) then it should be both permitted, accepted, and promoted as a valid gameplay style. In this case, radiation and the psychological horrors of living in post-apocalyptia are valid enough reasons for me. Again, this is just my opinion, but I really think it is ridiculous to criticize someone in an RPG for playing a valid character within the game mechanics. Now in regards to cheaters, dupers, etc... obviously that is another story. Again, just my opinion. 
---
Got everything but the rare and uncommon masks. Only had 3 berets drop and 1 donut/effigy recipes. The rest seems pretty common. It may all be rando but I doubt it considering luck in the rest of the game. Being there gives you rewards, not convinced either about participation.
---
I found 42 luck gives mainly soldiers masks. Owl is common in 30-35 luck range. 35-41 is where I got the berets and a lot of toothy man/soldiers. Try different ranges of luck. Level, hours played could play a role too. We really don't know what the programmers put in server side. I noticed the first girl who got the sun mask, she was tweeting the beth account, so it could be she works with them I dunno xD
---
With the build stairs in your workshop challenge, I did the same thing. It acted like I didn't have any budget to add my item back. Eventually after deleting and rebuilding s few more things, I was able to put all of my stuff back down
---
Yeah those people are assholes.  It's one thing to be able to critique a game.  It's a whole other thing to be an asshole cause someone likes something you do not.
---
Mind you, I had fun with 76, but I saw the flaws.
---
That true, but I also appreciate the effort they put into the realism of the game, so dead corpses got hidden under tall grass is reasonable. I just wish there’s an in-game mechanism to make it easier. Plus they can also use UV effect to hide certain clues and mysteries etc to make the game more interesting. 
---
Even if they dont add new guns, id at least like to see some skins that take your standard guns and make them look like different ones. Ex. Hunting rifle skin to make it look like a barret, or an assault rifle skin to make it look like.... well anything other then it does, thing looks ridiculous. Lol
---
Thanks for the comment!
---
But no worries, I'm not insulted by the bashing. I just think they're silly for thinking I would care ;)
---
Cheers !
---
Nice idea. The food and collection of cooking materials in this setup is atrocious. Lol
---
Any particular spots?
---
They can, and they do. Because it's their game, and they have the monopoly of executing punishment.
---
3 times, during beta, some random time in Morgantown, I stopped and took pictures, and then during the event, it blew in near the end.  
---
I think they turned down the instances of storms after the beta and it’s never gone back up.  
---
In addition to two crashes and long load times entering buildings in the ash heap I once loaded in surrounded by super mutants and had two broken legs (full health though).
---
Nah, they should have to get a new one. Companions die, its a part of fallout and a part of survival games.
---
I see you’ve never watched Johnny Dangerously and the 88 magnum.
---
Just wish you could shoot while seated.
---
 Trading I have no problem with, why would I? Its the steady I want this, and have caps.
---
 There is nothing wrong with it except the fact your game is based on making caps, which is easy, and not actually finding and taking part in generating these items, which is not. I go find what I want.
---
you can only scrap the storage ones designed to keep ingredients form spoiling. 
---
West tek is hit or miss, but always heavily populated with super mutants. The legendaries there are also the ones that like to run away. Pussies...
---
I keep getting legendary  sledgehammers from it, not great for my shotgun/critical build 
---
Did you give it an honest chance? I play a lot of game but I’ve played this consistently since the release it’s really not as bad as ppl portray it. I’ve noticed a lot of people just follow you tubers and use there opinion as there own. We all no negative comments on something will get you more views than positive so you tubers or streamers will say what ever gets them views.

Anywhere within the red zone before the nuke is dropped. Just stand there and you'll get it. My camp got nuked once, and I chose to take the achievement instead of retreating. Also had to rebuild everything...
---
How about an Auto Loot option with Filters? Like just loot Ammo, Caps and Chems. Could even be some 1* PE Perk Cards. Each Perk Card Auto loots another resource.
---
76 has a long way to go before it becomes better than 4. A REALLY long way
---
This is a great idea!
---
Lol a huge part of the fallout franchise is buying/trading you self righteous bellend. Go eat a dick.
---
Pardon my French. 
---
I haven’t got the trophies for reaching level 10 or leaving the vault, I know how you feel
---
Thank you for the offer but I want the flamingo plans-to surprise my friend because he really wants them.
---
All I see are the wolves? Lol where is the boss? Lolol
---
Yeah but one way you generate caps is by selling things other players want, I get your point I just think it’s a little misguided. Sounds like in your perfect world there would only be item for item trading. The thing is the trading system in this game sucks so it’s much safer to sell things for caps. I still do item for item trades tho as do many people in this game.

fasnacht parade event hints at coolers being added in the future. 
---
Today’s festivities have been canceled due to inclement weather. We predict orange cloud cover with a high chance of nuclear fallout...
---
And there's no stacking them right?  Just get one, turn it in, come back to bunker, repeat?
---
That will need a lot of filters though, there are so many different ammos and chems you’ll need to add dozens of them into the game. If one ammo card loots all ammos you’ll end up sorting and dumping most of the ammos you don’t need. 
---
fasnacht parade seems to hint at coolers for the future. 
---
I’ve had game since launch had seen one. I didn’t actually think they were in the game for a couple of months 
---
I mean there's a perk that makes food spoil 90% less if maxed. I highly doubt that this will happen when there is a perk that virtually does the same thing. 
---
Sorry mate, I’m Xbox 
---
i would be sad about the perma-death thing if they'd actually work at my camp. they just stand way outside my green ring way down at the bottom or a mountain and refuse to set foot in my camp. really sucks because getting a pet was probably what I was most excited about for this game when I learned it was in it. but RIP Craig, you shall forever live on in our hearts. I will also add I really wish Sloths would climb trees in our camps like they do in the wild :(
---
Yes.  If you pick up more than one it “counts” but just gives you 50 more exp on turn in.
---
If going for multiple rewards you will want to pick up one, go turn it in, go pick up another, etc.  
---
Don’t pick up anything out of the desks but the Technical Data.  Seems tha
---
Do you really thing Bethesda in incapable of pulling the meta data from any player? Do you think the meta data won’t show that the player was cheating? 
---
Did you know your cars computer system can keep track of how fast you’re driving and that data can be pulled from the car and used against you in court? 
---
Read a friggin book. Hookedonphonics.Com 
---
I'm pretty sure they said it's a bug and they're going to increase the volume of the horn
---
Very fitting with the survivalist and backwoods nature of the game. I would suggest that canning have a more dramatic reduction on hunger % potential  though as canning typically reduces nutrients and volume when compared to fresh food. 
---
Some recipes are already "canned" goods (relishes) and it would be cool to see more, but I don't think we need a new bench for this. It would be a cool alternate cooking crafting spot though.
---
Damn 42 luck
---
Well i would rather spend an minute or two dropping the ammo i don’t need, the  running around can’t finding the corpses to loot.
---
Haha. They can but didnt

---
To the people wondering why I put a CND bar on this. The original idea was to keep things similar as even the new beers have a CND bar but yeah I realized that is stupid. Not going to remove it from the main idea, but I accept defeat on that.  
---
For those wondering why I went Pre war preservatives instead of salt or just water like IRL canning. Concider the fact that we have radiation based diseases in fallout 76, yeah standard canning will not work do to the mutations in the world. The food that survives isn't canned food in the games it is the ones loaded with preservatives meaning something was destroying the food in the cans even 25 years after the bombs drop.   
---
And anyone who has gotten an illness for just being near a diseased glowing animal through a wall can probibly guess why. IT might be a stretch but it fits.  
---
Not only that but I think it would work for balance to require them as pre war food is quite rare, and salt is actually rarer. I want this to be rare but not to rare.  
---
Also full stealth sniper is... Welp no oneshot build. With normal sniper rifle. With two shoot explosive gauss should work... But it have to be fully upgraded. 
---
 Almost no one has what I want. I agree the system sucks to the point I use bags to trade. I usually give stuff away as that works, but I will not deal at all seriously unless I can talk to you.
---
 I have has fun times with those that will and I'm happy to marshal my rather serious abilities at a bench to do what I can for you.
---
Because I am always curious. It’s for a new character. I don’t have th ehandmade but I can craft them though.

canning completely prevent spoilage. all that happens when the cans hit ) is the become slightly less effective. 
---
I bought them from other players over a months time. 
---
Me too. I hate listening to the same songs every day. I’ve come to the point where I just don’t bother to turn on the radio at all. 
---
No, trying to cram every idea into a game is a recipe for failure.
---
Stop with the “missed opportunity” bullshit.  This idea is narrowly appealing at best and not a good use of resources that could be used for something everyone would want.
---
how about it requiring the cooking stove version of the cooking station?
---
Your e the man for doin this too btw. I’m on ps4 but if I was on pc I’d def take advantage of ur offer. 
---
Sit and shoot too!

Never been in the store. It’s just a extremely rare drop. 
---
You do know that the mg42 was an infantry weapon right?
---
The Germans in WWII had an entirely different meaning for the words heavy and light machineguns.
---
Most of the world separates them by caliber, so a hefty .50 would be mounted, while a .30 is man portable.
---
The germans only had one machinegun really. The mg34/42, so it was only considered heavy when mounted to a tripod, even though it was literally the same weapon that would be issued to the infantry.
---
I mean I'm fully aware or what canning does. Fairly certain everyone is. Doesn't change the fact that with this current perk active chances are this won't happen. It's Bethesda. Be realistic. Great idea, just won't happen. Unless this has already been announced. 
---
I killed my deathclaw by leading him into a pack of supermutants because he kept attacking my teammates. Even though they weren't damaged it got annoying after a while. He was gone for the longest time but with the recent update that fixed camp budget he was reincarnated into a radstag for some reason...
---
I think it'd be cool if they added in some of the weapons from the first 2 games. I'd love to have the HK g11 or the Pancor Jackhammer again! Also I think the melee weapon selection is a little odd. The guitarsword and wardrum are a little bit ridiculous. I could think of dozens of melee weapons that would be more realistic...
---
I think you are kinda stupid.
---
I know. I rock maxed tank killer. Only time i ever use the handmade is on the scorchbeasts and queen and it seems to fair alright when i only use tank killer. I might just take the auto off the handmade one of these days
---
Both the combat shotgun and assault rifle look ridiculous. They probably didn’t want to pay royalties to arms companies and decided to come up with their own design. All the rounded elements make them look clumsy and toy-ish compared to the badass Handmade and MG42. 
---
Slugger, incisor, all rise
---
This has the same energy as the first time I found a wendigo and found out the hard way they can open doors lmao
---
They are adding coolers in the future. The perk doesn't matter it is an option and one that not everyone can take for their build alternatives that require a resource investment instead of a perk investment can work.   
---
You can go the perk investment which gives a longer time on food but it still decays. Or you can go the resource investment which after a point doesn't decay but is less effective over all. 
---
That would make sense. I can vegetables quite a bit and most of the recipies I use are pretty simple. There are plenty of jars and cans in the game, no shortage of boiled  water. It makes sense. The Can Do perk could be used to reduce weight of canned goods. Personally I would much rather carry a stack of canned goods with a perk weight reduction. Canning foods is the single most realistic thing a survival game could introduce. 
---

I don't really enjoy one shotting everything. I love a decent challenge against enemies. I have a quad explosive hunting rifle i could use for sniping if not the lever action 
---
 Sounds like you encountered the Dovah Bear. XD
---
Did you have pacifist on? 
---
I have one you can just have. I’m on Xbox 
---
I'd love for you to provide any proof of that. EVEN IF that was true, it wouldn't explain why the build budget reduced for my character, it's not like I went down levels. 
---
Yes, the unarmed Powerfist and Deathclaw unarmed do have a higher damage potential than the 2H weapons.  But you also can't use them in Power armor, which is easy mode defense for PVE vs farming armor and using all the perks to make unarmed survivable.  So the trade off is higher damage and higher risk, or less damage and more survivability without relying on luck finding legendary armor.  
---
Woofle batting everything isn't the answer for balance, but it's the most prevalent response to whatever is currently meta.  There is always going to be a meta, no matter how much they woofle bat whatever currently is now.  It's a pointless circle.

Im gonna hit west tek then as i seem to be able to fire through super mutants with my handmade.

Over 700 hundred hours played. Only experienced 4 or 5 rad storms. It's been weeks since I've seen one now.

Not of the sun mask guy traveled before I could get a picture I do of the goblin, I'll share it on here when I get to it

Riiiight.  All those griefers are hard core, role-playing purists.  I’d give more credibility to your argument if 85% of my player interactions weren’t awful.
---
Wonder if I should send this link and a Copy paste of the idea to bethesda via feedback support ticket.... or just hope one is reading this. 
---
There's allegedly going to be *some* way to deal with unwanted ammo in the future, could have sworn I heard it mentioned in an "Inside the Vault" or through one of the Bethesda comments here on the subreddit. I'm hoping for the ability to scrap it so we can reload it into different types of ammo - could work just like the reloading bench from New Vegas, in that it shouldn't give back all the resources used to craft the ammo you're breaking down. That would preserve some of the game's economy while still giving us something useful to do with the oceans of ammo nobody wants.
---
Hey that's exactly where this started. Thanks. I thought possibly I bugged it due to the new booze items as well. Hopefully it fixes. 
---
Kind of opposite of this but I joined a 'defend this point' Event at the Morgantown airport with waves of Scorched. And they kept spawning up a cliff and then running towards us, falling down the cliff and dying from the fall damage!
---
 It was hilarious. Easiest event ever. 
---
My husband did that. But i sold some paintings of mine and bought it with my own money so he wouldn't be like "thats 60 dollars wasted". Because that's his opinion and that's fine, but if it's my money and i happened to like it, it would be my problem...not his. And i eventually made him plag it, and he liked it after playing. So i get that. Sad she didn't just get it in spite of him lolol. But I'm a bitch lol
---
The stored camp is probably only made for that type of terrain. What I do is scrap the blueprint and you’ll get all the pieces seperate :)
---
My last time I had a lot of wolves and a mega sloth.
---
Thanks. Sounds like it's do to the stairs challenge. Hopefully it fixes itself. The extra budget basically allowed me to perfect my base. 
---
Well I think you have the wrong idea what the event was suppose to be about.
---
Read the promo yourself.

I spended all my points on this solo build and u can say it open. If you miss second and 3rd shot better have oter semi.

If I can make an electromagnetic rifle and some power armor from some silver spoons and ammo pouches, I should sure as shit be able to can a pound of tomatoes.

This made me laugh.  "Ah HA! I closed the door, you can't get.......oh shit, this is going to hurt"
---
The animation is also problematic with the shotgun when chambering a round. You don’t ‘ride’ the bolt forward, it may actually cause jam, you pull it and let go so the spring will do it properly. 
---
I... is this a legitimate issue you have? You regularly play with teammates who use anti-epidemic?
---
Spotify has a fallout playlist I use and it's all the songs from all the games rolled into one.
---
Ahh no! Wish I could join
---
Actually, the hooded rags don't.
---
I know, it's stupid that no one can play the game and they're still coming out with new content.
---
I remember in the before times when the stash was 400 and my character was weak, I would press L1 to place my camp and it would remove the ap drain (just never place your camp). Haven't been in that situation in a while, maybe they patched it out?
---
The only time i had one was at the last day of beta, i havnt seen one ever since.
---
So you sort of found the guy?
---
So the first time I tamed anything it straight up teleported to my camp. It took about 60% of its health but when I fast traveled back after it disappeared it was already at home in my garden. The next time I hit tame, it started sprinting for my camp faster than I could keep up, and I saw a fissure directly in front of us. I server hopped thinking it would teleport there only to find an empty camp. But only for a while! I had gone back to server hopping at the bunker to find another when I ran out of food and needed to go back. I got there and lo and behold the sloth made it back!
---
Add your gt name so people can friend you.
---
Where is the sloth
---
Not nearly as bad. It has an arc, but it can still hit something a hundred feet away. Flechettes drop so fast, you’d have to aim like 75 degrees up to get 100 feet with them. 
---
Quote: "ok time to reload and then I'll go out there and - WOAH OW HEY WHAT THE FUCK Aw shit I died"
---
I checked to make sure after your comment but yeah  it’s off. I just don’t understand how this is even a possibility. I have the highest grade power armor I can have at the moment. Full prototype set. These guys were still in vault suits with basic leather and combat armor. Not even fully covered, mind you. They only had bits and pieces.
---
But the trade off of not fair, melee and unarmed should be reworked, It the only thing still overpowered in the game
---
The game balances PvP by bringing up the lower level's damage to be equivalent to your own.  So what should be a pea shooter for them for PvE is doing a lot more damage to you in PvP.  You also can't have Med-X and Psyco active at the same time, only one or the other, unless you're using one of the hybrid drugs.  
---
Someone tried to report me &amp; my party after we blocked the robots with power armor for shits &amp; giggles.
---
They were tryhards
---
I'll give you 3000 for it if u still have it
---
I have the game, loved it the first week, but holy fuck is it a flawed game. It’s hard to talk about the game without bringing up the laundry list of problems 
---
naaah, it's still an increase, and it appears that my problem was/is due to a challenge glitch. Building is probably my favorite thing to do so I may be biased, but rip that old thing down and build something new and cool. 
---
That's the last enemy at this event. After the supermutants.
---
Is better-than-thou a phrase? 
---
Ok no problem. I will be on after 10pm now
---
Supposedly, we can trade in our useless legendary items for better ones. I do think that the more stars on a legendary that you trade in, the better the item you can get. Also, the vendor won’t release until later this year. 
---
Honestly you’d be surprised how many people have asked me to buy with real money. Makes me not even want to play sometimes 
---
Yeah that happened with patch 7 ;) they redid a bunch of nav- and collision- meshes and I think they fucked that one up!
---
Oh they don’t work together? Damn I’ve been playing fallout since I was in 6th grade and I didn’t know that. I’ve wasted so many chems in that case. It’s also kind of stupid that it ups their damage. What’s the point of a leveling system then? Why have perks? Why have level based weapons and gear if it’s pointless to do so? I hope survival mode is done better. I really do.
---
Lmao I thought berets were special because they made your head invisible, now I know my game is just glitched
---
 But then my Combat Knives would be ridiculous, well they are already. ;)
---
No there is no raider like stuff at all, honestly it's disappointing that there isn't, especially because I Role play a raider character, also miss the junk building pieces from FO4. I have a strange feeling that they will add new stuff when the decorating mode cones out but only time will tell.
---
How are they supposed to store 1000lb worth of junk in a 800lb container?
---
If you didn't hit them and they didn't have explosive bullets, it's almost impossible for them to kill you. Luckily, on upcoming patch the slap damage will be reduced to 0 and those situations will almost be gone forever (I have PVP).
---
Btw you can't be under the influence of 2 drugs, just the last one you took.
---
Lol, the irony.

Have you noticed the body in the bonfire?  You can see legs sticking out near the side.  Gives the “burn him” new meaning

You want to apply all the xp boosts that you can. Once you’ve done that, ghouls and mutants are a good option for xp.
---
* Well rested
---
* Cranberry cobbler (go to aaronholdt farms in NW corner of the map)
---
* Cranberry juice (diseased cranberries)
---
* Feed the people event
---
* 3 ranks of Inspirational perk
---
This will give you about 27% xp bonus (I’m not sure if you can stack 2 food or 2 drink bonuses, but you can have both a food do boost and a drink xp boost active simultaneously).
---
If you play in survival mode (releasing soon) you’ll get an additional 20% boost.
---
Even after the buff, most laser weapons are far behind their ballistic counterparts.  There is never a true parity between weapons in any game; at that point if you make everything do the same DPS then  only difference between anything would be appearance.  And it makes no sense at all for a 10mm pistol to pack the same punch as a Fatman.
---
Except its not a lore fuck up? There's plenty of recipes that call for postwar items even though the recipe is pre-war. For the sake gameplay, and the player, the item in the recipe is just called razorgrain, instead of wheat, because if our avatar existed in universe, we would know wheat=razorgrain, so the recipe is displayed as such.
---
There's such a thing as gameplay/lore seperation, its why we can be shot a thousand times and not die, or why diseases only last an hour or so in game. Its not realistic for the universe, but no one wants to play a game where you get shot and then lie bleeding out for hours until you finally die.
---
Game works great for me.  Few weight bugs but all in works great.
---
Haha 😅👍
---
The sloth comes out of the trees on either side of the road, opposite from where the wolves usually come from.
---
Just bring back the camp options we had in fallout 4.  All these posts want one thing each back from fo4.  They should just include everything in one patch.
---
Mechanics usually are not all-encompassing, large-sweeping mantras like "clothing goes over armor in 76." You're ignorant of video games.
---
At least add Arlington VA, lots of lawyers live there so tons of pre war money to loot. Bethesda MD too. 
---
If you scrap a blueprint you don't get all of the structure pieces back, I've done this a lot to know. The blueprint mode is kinda shit and doesn't work in places it clearly should
---
My guy lol you don't have to continue to explain this to me. I AM AWARE of what you're saying. I just don't see it happening in this way. 
---
+karma. Great transaction 
---
No they were all slap damaging me at the same time. And I figured “hey I’m higher level than these guys. I can take them out easily.” So I pulled out my all rise super sledge that does 205 damage I believe, and I started swinging, I clipped the level 23 but he was still alive and then I just got blasted away by all 3. I just couldn’t believe it. I figured it was just luck on their end so I seek revenge and then the same thing happens again. I just walked away at that point because I was so pissed off about it.
---
I use excavator PA with calibrated shocks. I use heavy weapons, and i carry all of them with me at all times. Not because i need them but beacuse with bear arms all 7 of them together weigh in at less than 15 pounds. Where if they were in my stash theyd be upwards of 120 pounds. Also carry all my ammo and aid items. That leaves me with a lot of room in my stash for junk. Actually the only thing in my stash is junk. Lol. Never in short supply to fix anything.
---
-Bethesda spends months fixing bugs
---
-"we want new content!"
---
-Bethesda starts making new content
---
-"wtf you should be fixing the bugs"
---
THIS bullshit is why game developers never listen to the fans. You're not being constructive, you're just bitching.
---
Will you be on later tonight by any chance?  I’m looking for marsupial and should have the mats needed.  I’m working till around 3pm Pacific time though 
---
I either have a level 4 doe or a 32 glowing radstag too 
---
I know right! Check my post from yesterday on the exact same thing!
---
Yes, I’ve also seen three.
---
Thx I'm sure I will be doing the event like 10 times this weekend I'll look for it
---
But it isn't
---
No unlike most of fallouts enemies anti-vaxxers exist and are a huge threat
---
Gotcha. Just figured I'd ask as out of date mods had been the source of some folks recent issues on PC.
---
To all the people that don't have performance issues, that's great and i wish i didn't either. Some of us deal with freezing in menus, getting stuck in loading screens and god awful frame rate drops. Patch 6 was great for the issues i experienced but some of the problems have made a comback. If we can't come together and let BGS know that there are still issues, then more people will stop playing and new content will dry up very quickly
---
Yesterday uranium fever was no where near the mine on the map it was half way down the map this game just gets weirder and weirder.
---
Razor grain is pre-war wheat, mutated. It Cooks pretty much the same, except now it radiation resistant as a species. The stalks, leafs, and florets, have hardened to make them more dangerous, and protect the plant better. 
---
That's always been my assumption about razor grain.
---
What he said.  I have my camp near billings homestead. I pulled 70 razorgrain easily without green thumb and that wasn't even the whole field. 
---
That's a good question, I'm not really sure. Never really paid attention to that but if I find out I'll let you know!
---
No problem. Pm me your ign if you want to. I can sell 5 or 10 stable violet if you’re interested
---
I agree with your observation. I disagree with the fix you propose. This is from a PvP perapective:
---
Max damage isnt the distinction with melee, its swing speed. The faster weapon wins in a 1v1.
---
I run a 2h build.  I used to max out my damage until i realized it doesn't matter after certain point. I find around 1200 dmg is the sweet spot to one shot everyone. I dont need 2k dmg. So i dialed back on some things.
---
Whether my sledge doea 2k or 1200, I still one shot unarmed builds if i can sneaky get them first. If we see eachother... They ALWAYS win.. Whether my damage is 1200 or 2000. 
---
My point is: reducing unarmed dmg wont fix anything. As long as their dmg is above 1200, they will one shot players.
---
Should unarmed be nerfed? Probably not. It would take a 50%+ nerf to make it so unarmed needs 2+ hits to kill players.
---
Unarmed beats 2h. Its a games of rock paper scissors with builds. You have to know what beats what and adjust.
---
I take a stealthboy the second i realize my opponent is using unarmed &amp; sees me. It levels the playing field, they can no longer vats me &amp; I can kill them more often than not. 
---
Stealthboys are the great equalizer. 
---
Tldr: your suggested balance change wouldnt balance anything. 10% dmg isnt what seperates unarmed from 2h. Both clases are able to output 900+ more damage than necessary. Swing speed is what seperates unarmed from 2h.
---
Radaway 
---
Yes I still have it
---
You might not be making an actual comparison though. Just feeling amazing, because you haven’t tried the insanity that is a puncturing power fist. Built in armor piercing (not a lot, but still), insane damage output, only need 3 perk cards and you’re doing more damage, faster, with a lighter weapon than 2h. Sure, you can’t use it in power armor, but a nice legendary suit of armor is almost always better than PA, excluding nuke zones. My level 37 is running around oneshotting supermutants with zero legendary anything, not using a low health build. Just a level 30 puncturing power fist. 
---
Wow I heard so many ppl talking about it and I'm usually playing on a team never seen it lol
---
Is it really a bug though? Dealing with pain and loss is something people do in an apololyptic world
---
I dream of getting a more desolate and monster-filled pre-settler Far Harbor, that would make my year.
---
Wow thanks for the detailed instructions.
---
"lore fuck up?" Seriously? Razorgrain is mutated post-war wheat. You just use the equivalent ingrediants available.
---
Let me blow you mind on another thing: Brahmin Meat is basically BEEF!
---
But hooded rags don't so....
---
Max scrouger perk, 80% chance of any medical, water, drug items
---
I love this Idea, there needs to be some kind of balance around food, I  mean in reality the food seems to spoil in less than a in game day cooked and with in a hour uncooked? And for all the efforts that go into getting a variety of food sources, it can be very difficult and tituss, constantly going back to camp or finding a cooking station with in an hour, before you lose it as a food resource and it spoils. This Idea should include everything around food and drinks. With an indefinite CND. In addition to this there should be a purchasable map indicator, showing where all the different food sources are, just like the mining map. 
---
See this is the issue, a gun should not be what determines damage, the bullet should. Also the type of damage a weapon causes wether it's ballistics, energy, plasma, fire etc. Should be what separated it but Bethesda made the effects of each one the same but just have a different FX appear, they could easily rebalance this if they took the time.
---
Do you use a LAN cable or WiFi?  I was having poor game play while using my WiFi but switching over stabilized the game quite a bit. 
---
Oh.... I’m sorry. 
---
Clearly why its a bug, thanks for following along with the conversation and showing your intelligence.
---
Discussing this topic on "white knight Fo76 reddit" is pointless.
---
Bad business practice is bad and cheating is cheating. 
---
Full stealth sniper is no oneshot build? Sorry what? “Full” stealth sniper would also mean low health/vats build (that’s the “full” in full). My stealth vats lowhealth sniper oneshots max level ghouls and and Scorched in Exploration perk loadout (IE Zero combat perks) with body shots with her 1star bloodied lever action. 
---
Got plenty of drugs, I would love any afk cure for low radiation
---
I got to the point where I just started dumping the mask.  
---
All I want is the fucking jesters mask.
---
A lot of people pretend they weak but have superior armour and high level damage, these could be their alt characters they boosted with dmg somehow .. also supposedly you weaker in PA than in regular armour ..   did they all hit you all at the same time or 1 one of them do it ?
---
At one point I found donning the wedsing ring removed my underoos. 
---
That's been fixed, although a couple patches went by before I tried it again so I don't know when. 
---
But it clearly is. Sorry youre incapable of thought.
---
 My Nocturnal 40% Speed one hits at around 185. That's 4 or 5 times a second. I melt Ghouls at The Whitespring so fast people complain. ;) I can do that 4 or 5 stabs a sec basically forever. ;)
---
Perk cards under Endurance, I believe it is Sun Kissed, removes radiation between 6am and 6pm 
---
Except it applys to every form of clothing in the game except this one. Sorry youre wrong kiddo.
---
But it is and youre stupid.
---
I’ve never asked for content, they SHOULD fix the base game first. Before doing anything else. Survival mode is going to be useless because the game is shit. 
---
Nice!  This is giving me some great ideas for the Great Application Sweepstakes Prize Bot.  I don't like to relocate my camp but I could totally make an exception for the next time he chases me down the road.
---
I've experienced a few.  I think they should happen more often after a nuke has gone off.  They ought to have a severity associated with them, too.  Some should be downright awful even in a hazmat suit.
---
I found three. The first one ran from me, i was able to kill the other two. Unfourtunately, it glitched and i got no loot from them :/
---
The first one was in the northern area of the ash heap, the second was on the western side of the cranberry bog bordering thr savage divide, and the third was in the southern area of the mire. So i feel just thr southern area of the map in general is a good plsce to look for it.
---
Meanwhile i only ever saw the mothman once, and i didnt notice until it did the "woosh" animation and flew away.
---
Depends what you doing and shooting and what type of ammo you need. Put your camp next a lead deposit, lots of them on the map. I am mostly a melee build, but I still pick up 99% of all ammo in case I ever need it and never drop it. Only thing I dump are mini nukes, missiles and grenade ammo. I mess with guns when I want to have a. bit of fun. But you generally need steel, lead and gun power and maybe some other stuff depending on your ammo .. also get scrounger I think it's called for more ammo from ammo boxes
---
Chems stacked in other games.  Just not 76
---
I do it all the time. At least twice today😂. And it’s worked each time
---
Aw, I liked New Vegas.
---
Yeah, I pick up all ammo I find, even if I have no guns that use it, just in case. And I use a wide variety of ammo types 
---
All I want is the anti-materiel rifle! 
---
They should.   Both radio, and game  OST.
---
They would definitely get applause from bringing fan favorites from previous games, and we could always use more unique game  music. Interiors/dungeons could seriously use a few extra songs for example,  and certain regions should have more unique tracks so they don't have to share Forest music so often.
---
I think NV Having DT(damage threshold) and in rare cases DR( damage rating), there's a lot that should be added to the game to make every play style unique rather just the same
---
It's messed up for now
---
You can’t anymore. 
---
Nice idea especially with fasnacht tons of my squirrel bits and wolf neat spoils quick eben with cooking
---
You can use multiple chems in regular fallouts, just not 76!
---
Did you forget to switch accounts? Or did you just not reply correctly to someone?
---
The ability to inspect items in a vendor's menu disappeared after last patch. Probably a bug and for now you just can't view it
---

---
My full stealth sniper VATS build. 
---
I run full unyielding (I have a Chameleon piece I swap in if I engage in PVP, but I’m not a PvPer by any means) with a few random 2 and 3star pieces (my favorite are my 3star legs with Acrobat on each).
---
Bloodied 1star LA, adrenal reaction, eagle eyes, healing factor, I think a couple others.
---
The lever action is literally all I need, but I carry a backup bloodied .44 if my LA breaks. I’ve got a bloodied Bowie knife (she’s a cowgirl, it fits the theme) if I want to don’t want to 1shot things (although it still hits hard... with the armor I still have like 16 strength)
---
Yeah they do
---
This - I have this and hardly ever need radaway
---
You can't, this is something that's definitely wanted by many people. Hope they add this feature in an update.
---
The jet will make you jittery 
---
Do U think they had bloodied builds?
---
If your on PS4 I can ope it for you 
---
Game works for me on PS4 
---
Exactly, I’ve played wow since vanilla and i understand what it’s like to grind (not getting a certain mount for 6 years) but a .03% drop rate on a limited event is a little absurd. Like you said I think they should be in the same pool as the beret 
---
ok I have tons of ammo but probably use ammo a potential part of the time, I do have one of my camps next to lead deposit .. and recently started to use the scrounger perk to see if I can get fusion cores to pop
---
Most everyone I play with has long disabled capture. It negatively impacts game performance.  
---
But even then how many people even know the masks could be rare, or that the share feature exists and those that do, how many actually let it run? 
---
... my nonlegendary level 30 fist hits for 260 something. I don’t need more than 1 hit on most things. I hear what you’re saying, I’m just says you might not actually have a good point of comparison if you haven’t tried what you can do with fist weapons. 
---
Here is a list of all the deposits if you unfamiliar with it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
Am I alone in thinking that that is bullshit? I spend a lot of time and resources farming a certain workshop, and all it takes is two of them to come in and take it.
---
The only issue is the licensing for new music. Ide be all for this because I would love more.
---
Power armor is horrible for pvp, might as well be naked basically
---
I wonder how much copyrights cost?
---
Thats probably the gating factor... 
---
The businessman in me says this:
---
Bethesda may be able to make a deal with someone who owns a good deal of older music in this genre.  With little upfront cost, add the ATOM shop as an avenue for players to purchase the music from whoever owns it. 
---
Bethesda: " We will sell your music in game &amp; pass *x*% of the revenue from the ATOMs shop along to the seller, but not pay anything up front"
---
Someone who owns some older music would take that deal.... I would
---
Im sure pistol packin mama didnt create any revenue besides the fallout series in 40 years!
---
Carried by infantry, MOUNTED on a bipod or tripod for firing. Not held and fired. Same with the huge barrel shroud "assault rifle" that is clearly taken from about 5 different mounted machine guns.
---
Ah, hello Trolly McTrollface. It’s been a while. How’s your mother?
---
So gourds arn’t pumpkins, but they look just like it? Pumpkins can be found, but not planted? 
---
Your comment is irrelevant then...
---
YEah all becomes there's and even the turrets you build turn hostile against you. If someone takes your workshop, jump servers before they finished taking it else you just going to lose caps in most cases for your level, so if you level 100, you going to lose 100 caps each time they kill you.
---
Build blueprints so you spend as little time time setting up a workshop, so if you take another you just drop the blueprint which takes seconds, don't spend a lot of time setting it up unless you bored and want to pvp and know what you doing. I don't take workshops outside of when I need to for challenges, but if I did, I would set it up and leave the server and leave everything unlocked so it becomes unowned (you need a friend and on a team), then come back and you can still get resources from it if no-one takes it during the time. 
---
Very rare it makes sense to bother with workshops any more, better ways to get resources.
---
Any update on this? I'm also curious. 
---
It works when you scrap but you don't always get all your walls and foundation pieces back, several times I've lost literally half of the pieces of structures I built.
---
According to my own written list you’re golden 😊
---
I’ve run into it twice in the woods, around night/sunrise (idk if that’s a factor).  Killed it once, don’t remember whether I got anything notable.
---
Just let me put live grenades in people pockets 
---
I would definitely pay for reskins and model changes on all the weapons, definitely an M16, M4, M1911 would be my first 3 purchases
---
Only once I'm 430 hours in lol
---
Yeah, that would've probably made me pucker tighter than a snare drum.
---
That too.
---
Hey man won’t be on for another hour or so
---
Catch up tonight then if that works. No worries 
---
so there is recipes for tick blood tequila and lead champagne?  then i guess we put them in the fermenter to make vintage?
---
Yeah sometimes I've had to wait like 10 minutes. I've got bloody mess but that hasn't worked for me. I normally toss on a chameleon piece and go do something else irl for a few minutes and just wait it out.
---
At least 3-5 times on XB1, he shows up near my camp above and around Huntersville and south of that location mostly, he is a pain to kill.
---
Yup!
---
I played 3 forever and just keep hearing bad things about 4
---
Your alowed one drug effect one alcohol unless they changed it in a patch note that i missed
---
[Don't underestimate the Germans and their instructions for everything](https://youtu.be/oOVEXBeA-eI?t=77).
---
The assault rifle is just a mishmash of garbage though. People dug around in the FO4 files and found references to it being "light machine gun" with the implication of being some sort of power armor user intended weapon.
---
In terms of realism we shouldn’t be teleporting
---
Appalachia is so much more fun to traverse through than the Commonwealth ..it's beautiful 
---
I love this idea conceptually, I agree that canned food shouldn't have a CND timer. Balance it some other way. I'd be in favor of requiring extra ingredients. I do think it's an awesome and badly needed idea, however you balance it.
---
I like the idea. But canned food should lose all non food bonuses, and never decay. Maybe add some new fresh recipes that use canned fruit or veggies... and have bonuses. But the canned food itself would have 0 rads and only give food (maybe even make canned meat be water negative). Needs to be heavy also. 1 or 1.5 per unit. Balance it by making it less useful and heavier. 
---
I think a "food preservation station" would make sense as well. Jerky.  Dried fruit. Etc. Water negative and reduced food values... but no change to or even enhanced bonuses and no cnd to lose. Add "canning" as another option to it and viola.  Maybe do drying like the fermenter. You put it in the dryer and it loses cnd, but instead of spoiling it becomes the "dried" version. 
---
Well i will be unequiping my weapons when i fast travel now. Anyone selling a TSE handmade or lever for xbox?
---
 Do you have any idea how much fun it is to go in my T Shirt and Slacks, somewhat augmented, to Harper's Ferry and pull out my knife. Its really hard to beat for fun RP.
---
 I sneak attack the entire town for fun. I take it down with very little damage, and go talk to my bud Wallace.
---
 I don't like the various punchers much and my X0-1 attacks with my tiny knife are hilarious fun. I helped a friend with the flying bot for a nuke card as I have a gun. ;) Knocked it down into the back of Wes Tec and it fell into a pack of Muties, maybe 10 or so.
---
 I Jet Packed off the cliff, dropped into the midst of them and ... they are all dead. Its amazing how fast that happens. Eventually the rest got down to me and took the silly card. Death From Above. ;)
---
Building a new character is fun..create one now and start leveling 
---
A secret to find if it's explosive is to unequip the demolition perk and view damage. That's all I know.
---
Also happens with the drill
---
I'm going to look over my home network design..  Using an Orbi mesh...  Seems to work great, but the gaming pc is on a satellite.  Might have to change that.  Thanks for the input!  Much appreciated!
---
&gt; game that doesn’t even work to begin with! 
---
\*does fausnacht event\*
---
I am sorry, it seems to be working just fine. could you maybe stop spouting bullshit?
---
Hahaha I've been there. It was "ok there are two of them and I got one down to...wait what the f*....there are 8 of them!....RUN AWAY! RUN AW.........aww they killed me." Then the walk of shame to go back for your junk.
---
Granted the masks have been seen, we don’t know if they’re left over Dev room items. When the accidental unbanning happened I was at whitesprings when I guy loaded in and said “hell yes, I still have my 600 speed demon serums, and 400 marsupial.” So they didn’t clear those accounts yet, could just be left overs. Or someone that got into the Dev room and dropped it for other players. I just find it crazy all the people that have the mask don’t have any proof of them actually getting it from the event. Just in their inventory or at a trade station, never actual screen shot or video proof of it dropping. Every mask seen has been on ps4 where gameplay is always being recorded.
---
I will buy Marsupial if you can hold it for an hour
---
No I’ve found both a long time ago, they are for the quest where you find the missing boy
---
Yeah, it’s a supplemental weapon only. SBQ and cavalier users are what I carry them for. If your into trading get one with the weight reduction perk and just use it for that.
---
whats your platform, if ps4 i can help ya do it.
---
Dont we inoculate ourselves in an early mission though?
---
I actually got an Anti-Armor LMG from it that I use to clip SB wings, so yes, everyone should have a chance. We should treat it like a Pinata. Let everyone whack it once, then put it out of it's misery.
---
It really bugs me that some people are all about nuking the event to make it harder. That completely ruins the experience for anyone that's a lower level, and I highly doubt it changes the mask drop rate.
---
Well I'm not sure if it's the same guy who robbed us. Just someone like 10mins away just after we got robbed got robbed. Still finding out details. And they didn't let out school early, people picked up their kids early and the bus couldn't let off some kids where the cops were chasing this guy. The girl is still missing. There was some old information passed to me from a robbery last year with the two guys with the neck tattoo.
---
It's an event that takes place at the RobCo Research Centre.
---
At the end of the quest you are pretty much guaranteed 2\* or 3\* Gutsy, sometimes even two at a time.
---
All 3 versions of radx/radshield will stack, but all of the drugs that give combat advantages (medx, psycho, etc) cancel each other out if you take more than 1.
---
The same applies to alcohol and food. For example, if you drink a whiskey and then drink a wine, the +1 STR bonus from the wine will cancel out the better +2 STR bonus from the whiskey.
---
They’re not on the list. 
---
I am, my username is (ITS_CALLUM_) excluding the brackets if ya need it
---
LOL sounds like watching Lemmings fall to their death. Lemmings was a great early 90's game. A little historical gaming trivia for you.
---
This is the reason I stopped playing ARC survival when it was still in beta and never turned back.  Well not the invisible ghoul part just the time sink
---
They are available to anyone as of a recent patch.
---
yes they said they took the flare out of the legendary drop cause it didnt have any legendary versions but either do the drill or the syringer ....why are they still in the drop pool?
---
Pretty sure there is one that spawns in the Ash heap region at the top of one of the weird mansions.
---
Fair point :o okay, humans that come back would make sense 
---
Yeet
---
There is a chrome paint for them in the atom store
---
I got a syringer off the sloth at the end of the event one time, but I'm a new player and didn't think much of it
---
Can confirm im lvl 99 and i bought them at watoga train station yesterday
---
Thanks I figured it out. Super annoying to rebuild. Hopefully no one builds in my spot lol 
---
This is good question. Why vendors are so much useless
---
Got one myself 
---
Possibly, not sure yet because real life got in the way.
---
I’ve had my camp in the same spot for a while now, south west of site alpha near the little foot bridge. After the recent patch,  I now have a random spawn right outside my camp. One time it was a mr. handy and a nanny bot bantering, another time it was two naked mannequins facing each other at a distance and another dressed mannequin behind the woman, looking like he just caught them in the act. I wonder what else is going to turn up there. 
---
Silune
---
I'm fine with the owl mask tbh. Goes so well with inspector
---
I saw them so often in Fallout 4, but they're almost a myth in 76. I've seen them a couple of times, and I can understand they don't want to overwhelm new players with sudden radiation, but it could just not activate in the Forest area.
---
Honestly this guy stole stuff and wrecked your house and supposedly responsible for? This guy needs to get sent to a asylum with the work staff imaginable.
---
Were getting vending machines in the new update for your camp so you can set prices for stuff and just let it roll. Also check out fo76markets
---
So you can sell the junk and aid items you've been hording for their sweet sweet 200 caps
---
Omg i didnt know i needed this
---
I still have a couple plans I got with a new character, they were a lot cheaper then.
---
Sent.
---
im at work so i wont be home until 830pm est, roughly 6 hours from now but would be happy to get ya through a silo run.
---
WHY IS THOMAS DESTROYING HELGEN?!
---
Really!? That’s awesome! I just looked today and didn’t see any 
---
I already prefer 76 to 4.
---
When I first started play 4, it felt so much different from NV and 3 that I simply didn't enjoy it. I'm not sure what it was precisely, but I could tell within the hour.
---
That being said, I can understand why people do like it. Among other reasons, it has great combat and weapon/armor modding was superb. Similarly, I can understand why people hate 76. It has no NPCs and can feel empty [I first thought it felt empty when watching my first livestream, but as soon as I played for myself the feeling was blown away due to my first experience with another player].
---
I'm not sure what makes me like 76 over 4, but I just do.
---
Daily biv quest is how I got mine
---
Keep doing the daily missions with biv.. random reward

That gave me a good laugh. Not sure if you meant it the way I read it. I read Bethesda pls the same as bitch please.
---
👍
---
Defend it then. 
---
I'll buy marsupial. I'll be on until around 5pm.

It sucks, I've had a mirelurk king named Gill, a scorched yao guai named Fluffles, and a mirelurk named Leonardo DiPinchi, all of which died too soon (within a week at best).
---
Sounds good, cya then :)
---
I too like them aswell
---
It’s funny how you keep coming up with excuses for why no one can prove these masks are dropping. This event has been completed hundreds of thousands of times over the last 5 days, but not a single confirmed instance of the masks dropping... they aren’t dropping. 
---
Yeh I pretty sure when u go to pick it up it turns into a normal variant (haven’t tried since November so may have changed by now)
---
Ah thanks guys. Yeah, they need to remove those, its already bad enough when you kill a three star you usually don't get a three star item.
---
Like, a lot more often. Much more weather and more severe weather would be expected for a post nuclear wilderness
---
It was too easy to become overpowered in 4. By level 60 I was a savant in guns and melee, which really ruined a lot of the replay value. The survival mechanic is great, one of my favorite parts of the game. I'm level 90 in fo76 and there's still a bunch of perk cards I want to get that I haven't had the points for yet. There's still a bunch of stuff in the atom shop that I want to get (without actually buying atoms)  76 has kept me a lot more interested for a lot longer. Even with a lack of end game content. And with all the content releasing later this year, I'm fucking giddy for 76. It's gonna be amazing
---
well for some reason its in the drop table, just bad luck when it happens.
---
Idk, I just hope this guy is the same guy that hit our house. 
---
On a side note, can you see the main post or has it been deleted? I can't seem to find it on the sub looking for it unless I go through my profile post. I just find it weird. It's like it vanished.
---
I haven't watched any YouTube videos about the game. Also I'm level 129 so I think I've played enough to know its bad.
---
You’re outside the forest area and moved towards the east.  That area is based on the highest player in the area
---
Okay I’ll be on in an hour or so
---
I’m very glad you enjoy the playstyle you have found. This topic isn’t about how you enjoy the game. It’s about weapon balance. 
---
I launched a nuke, fast traveled to it, made it to the center and tried to catch the bomb, got obliterated into a pile of goo and got the achievement. 
---
Cool, thanks
---
K, but that's the far smaller and lighter m 34 that has a much lower fire rate.
---
And that's kind of proving that I'm right. The person doing weapons in Fallout doesn't know anything about guns.
---
But I need those items because I'm new. My post was mostly about why they are useless for new players
---
You can carry 7 heavy weapons but as soon as i put two rifles in my inventory i add 20-30lbs. Well whatever at least you can bring the dps to any sbq fight so props to you.
---
Heavy rainstorms and more rad storms would make the atmosphere much cooler.
---
Maybe the reason they happen so often in Fo4 is because a bunch of assholes dropped a whole bunch more nukes after the war.
---
Im 50/50, 1 side is that this would be funny, the other side is that this would be both irritating and immersion breaking, people still moan about the kid in a fridge quest in FO4 because apparently people cant take jokes
---
Thank you ^-^

Pro tip: the first star is in the name (usually), second star shows above the level/damage area, if it has a third star you’ll have to buy it to find out. 
---
I’ve got to disagree with your assessment. I agree swing speed is important though. I’m incredibly PvP heavy, and spend most of my time fighting other players. And for my Melee experience I’ve used Anti-armor swing speed, for a combat knife, a grog axe, and both powerfist and a DG; for 1H and 2H I used a 3-2-1 for the perks, resulting in 45% Extra Damage plus Bloody Mess. 
---
Now, I’m not Bloodied, but I’m still really strong, and can kill most in 1 hit, but it’s often that it takes more than just 1. When I was switching to Unarmed, without having iron fist on (+30% dmg) I was still doing a little more damage than my fully repaired grog axe. With the 30% it blows it out of the water, and I still can use the extra 3 on barbarian. Is it hugely unfair? Idk maybe, but it’s definitely unfair in the sense that using 2H in that scenario inherently puts you at a disadvantage. 
---
If you have good armor, you won’t get 1-hit by anyone 
---
If it provides an army of enemies to fight. I can barely tag most of the enemies in the parade before some TSE shotgun user disintegrates it.
---
 Yes. And Combat Knives are seldom thrown in the weapon balance mix. I thought it was good idea.
---
 If your puncher hits at 260, my knives trump its ass.
---
Also stealthboys need to be reworked, they’re absolutely trash. And using them in PvP is just unfair. 
---
i loved fallout but not this one
---
How about the option to play an eating and drinking animation too, like press and hold the use button to play the animation that just repeats until you move again, just for role play sakes really
---
Tatos* :p
---
Did one last night around 10:45pm central time. The jester make dropped, and a guy was lucky enough to get the army beret off the sloth.  It was a solid parade run lol. I've been lucky enough to not get any doubles yet of the masks. I think it's just all RNG. 
---
Are you wanting your tamed creature to work and act like, dogmeat from FO4?
---
I have an extra Quantum X-01 plan on PS4 if anyone has any interest in buying it.
---
Sometimes it is nice to quickly unequip all armor for berserker/naked challenges (like the hazmat suit, but without the weight), maybe this is why?
---
I had a Playstation 1 copy of Lemmings and Oh No More Lemmings! One of the first games I played I think. I didn't make the connection but yeah, those Scorched were acting just like lemmings lol. 
---
This^^^. Learned the hard way and came here to ask when I was low level lol. 
---
Nothing wrong with the game, it's the people who act like it's the greatest ever made and every other Fallout sucks.
---
Why are tatos tomatoes and not potatoes
---
How is it unfair if everyone had the same opportunity to farm/use them. 
---
Seems pretty fair to me!
---
A maxed out Pharma Farm perk card will really help with the chem/health items. Just remember to search every aid/chem box.
---
This is a baller idea
---
That's the best use of the gas signage, I'm jealous I didn't think of that myself.  Now if we could ha e a "Thanks for Visiting" sign to put on the otherside that they'd see when they leave.
---
This is a multiplayer game. My collection of junk/legendaries/plans/ammo got way better after I started trading that stuff with friends or other players. I don’t need shotgun ammo, but my friend doesn’t want 5mm. So voila- now we’re both happy :)
---
I enjoy Fallout 76, but nothing can replace single player games.
---
Oh rip ok
---
It would be great to put in an outfit and some abraxo to get a temporary clean version. Maybe with +1 charisma 
---
Is this console? If so xb1? PS4?
---
Right here with you on the way it feels. We were hit twice, so maybe you’ll appreciate our attention to security.
---
Steel reinforced entry doors. Shatterproof storm doors. A 7-foot fence around the backyard. Two house dogs (one pit and one little doggy alarm Doxle), 3 adults, two of whom are regular range-goers and CCW holders, plenty of ammo, a professionally installed full alarm system, and 4 exterior cameras.
---
So...if anyone really wants to get in, they will. But the goal is twofold: make enough noise to alert us first so we can greet you if we’re home, or get recorded in the act and hope you can steal what you want before the police respond to the auto-dial if we’re not home.
---
Lol Yh 
---
I’ll be on in an hour or so
---
It says removed 
---
I can’t help but think, that giving us the ability to mount  our trophies heads on a wall, some griefer is gonna want the same of ours..lolz.
---
Yeah...  it is so low that an event that was amazingly fun has quickly soured...  I have seen the event go from mobs of 20 people to running it from start to end; to doing it solo for the first 18 minutes until a flash mob of 4 players join for the end.
---
If you did set it bizarrely high, maybe tweak it down for at least a few?  
---
At least the owl mask is obtainable I guess.  It is the coolest to me.
---
If you go to West Tec you can see they were working on mutated plants before the bombs fell. So somehow Lewis got his hands on some razorgrain.
---
Yeah, but that doesn't work too well when my friends don't play video games haha. Hopefully the vendor update works well for trading. I'm a melee character so I literally don't need ammo, but I'm also a hoarder sooo
---
This is completely false. I just went and actually checked.
---
Nope...  not anymore.   People have stopped trying.  
---
I don’t doubt your story. We’ve been burglarized twice. Our first priority afterwards was increasing security.
---
Ah thank you. Can you tell me what a berserker gun does please?
---
Ok... so one food, one drink, one combat drug is what you can use at any given moment?  Not interested in the rad-x because of the suppression of mutations (but glowing bloodpacks work for some extra resistance correct?)
---
Do you have marsupial and are you on now?
---
Considering there is only one confirmed mask on ps4 so far the 0.2% number is too high lmao
---
Take a run through West Tec. You will see they were working on mutated plants before the bombs fell. Something to do with FEV virus
---
Gentlemen gentlemen, there's no need for all this thoughtless savagery!! 
---
The Harper's Fairy vendor should sell them
---
There's a nuka dark recipe?
---
Looking for anyone with sentinal or paladin paint for T60
---
PC/ nick: majorfroze/help with quest
---
so hello everyone, 
---
im stuck on wasted on pickaxe pilsner quest from biv because i need to get somehow strangler bloom which is on high-level area where im on 17 lvl.  
---
but hey - you can just run, take strangler bloom and get the hell out of that place before creatures gets you!  
---
unfortunately its not that simple - strangler bloom spawning only in certain area randomly and whenever i server hopping to find strangler bloom i almost instant die.  
---
like i said before im on level 17 but for that little help i can give you nukashine or screws or anything you find important
---
thanks in advance
---
I usually get them when all robots survive, and I killed a ton of attackers.  Dunno if that is the connection though.
---
That’s gorgeous! I’d love to come back to that after a long bit of mutant smackin’. I’m inspired now!
---
I saw this at David Copperfield once... you rotated the stage as you looked away didn’t you?
---
Yep. I just bought it for 4k. Wanna know what the recipe is?
---
No. Hell, if I could stick it in my house and keep it completely safe and out of combat I would. All I want is to be able to save it from permadeath. The medic weapons in this don't work like Fallout 4 so I can't even heal him.
---
Huh, that was pretty fast, too.
---
It can be so strange to forget you're wearing something with a logo and have strangers say 'you guys suck' or even 'we did great last night' 
---
I was introduced into one of my friends cause we played with the same person, then we played together without him, and the two others were people that we were trading with from reddit. They just never left, lmao. It all started cause I ran around a nuke zone one day asking if I could team with someone and share rad sponge cause I was dying
---
Berserker is more dmg the lower your dmg resistance
---
Marsupial and Healing
---
Bethesda employees,
---
I have yet to  figure out how to either craft or scrap "Shoguns". I doubt that there  is an easy way to scrap any Samurai Warriors, let alone 76 of them in a  post-apocalyptic world. Please advise.
---
(ie. you spelled Shotgun wrong in the Challenge's Combat selection tab. I was laughing a lot on this one.)
---
Yeah you got it. Mainly you want psychotats and then finish with daytripper, scortchbeast liver, and alcohol. I don't know if there's much other than ap regen for drinks worth carrying. The resistances are usually handled with perks, gear, mutations.
---
For a game that “Doesn’t even work to begin with” there sure are a lot of people playing it. 
---
Its on fullscreen, but it still runs terribly.
---
People show up and don't try or just stopped showing up altogether? Personally I got totally burned out after like 120 duplicates and do it maybe 2 - 5 times a day now. Definitely not expecting a mask anymore though.
---
There is like 1 or 2 confirmed rare mask. If you think this event is okay you have issues of delusion. Giving feedback constructively about an event is not a bad thing. Your attitude about it and the people who disagree with it is far more toxic and arrogant
---
You’re right, and there are a lot of people that are saying that it doesn’t work. 
---
That's why most people didn't believe this happens, I farm Watoga on the regular and see this happen a few times an hour.
---
https://youtu.be/QMA7caLuGYo
---
This happened yesterday in my camp. Obviously the moron was french,where else....
---
I sell them chems I don't use. Most people have way more stuff to sell them than caps they've got. It's interesting that you're finding you don't have anything to sell them. 
---
And selling crap legendaries might not get you much at once, but they're not good for much else. 
---
So is your reasoning.
---
Double-Check audio settings in your game, and in your system (or console) if you have surround on. That was something I forgot when I switched audio systems last time.
---
It's ok I've looked it up on the wiki lol
---
Take a look.
---
Curious too
---
Hyperbole just ensures that you're incorrect. 
---
That is true abot SBQ. I show up in full force. Me and a couple of buddies took her down ourselves. Two heavy gunners focused on the queen, two melee focused on the ads (they also had cryolators to freeze the queen and larger enemies). We took her down in 15 mins.
---
Or, in the spirit of the Macho Mod, make Scorchbeasts go "WOOOOOOO" every time they fire off a sonic blast. 
---
Random reward from Biv. If you're on PS4 I can sell you my extra
---
I could build for you! I’ll do it free of charge! Hopefully your on Xbox! I can do it Thursday because I’m already helping some people out with sbq and other quests!
---
Easier said than done when you're by yourself and a group of way higher level players decide they want it more.
---
I'll try deleting the config files, and also i have 8 GB of VRAM.
---
Aka no armor at all = highest damage multiplier 
---
Well, that's just like, your opinion man.
---
Does anyone find the music list in the game (76) pretty repetitive? 
---
I would have loved a big classical music selection. The classical jukebox list is garbage.  Wouldn’t it be easier to license a bunch of classical music cause of the expired copyrights? 
---
I agree
---
They are tomatoes and potatoes 
---
I have found them randomly in armor mod plan locations.  
---
Last week I found Plan Deep Pocketed Combat Torso in the church in harpers ferry on the oil drum next to the Armorer Bench.  
---
No vendor sells them unfortunately.  
---
I forget to do that haha 
---
Most of the time in Watoga the bots just automatically die whenever I get near, or they plop out dead after being summoned from the tubes.
---
I am on PS4, Naniki13.
---
I am a casual/ritual player. I dont have a large group of friends that play it like I do. I am in desperate need of some help or a point in a general direction for good weapons and plans. I have done a decent job farming recipies and going to Google for getting things. 
---
Willing to put work into it. I also have 8 bravo codes but not sure how to get that nuke off lol.
---
And remember wastelanders! Don't feed the Yao Guai! Three Dog, signing off! -howls-
---
....what
---
So give me your 5mm and other random whatevers, and I’ll give you my anti-armor Grognaks axe :)
---
I agree about friends not playing. Most of my Irl friends don’t play the same games as me, so I meet new people in-game and have a few ppl I play with now. But there’s no harm in meeting ppl in-game, and asking via the area mic if they want to trade any ____ for your ____. Many higher level players give things (stimpacks, purified waters etc) to low-level characters we meet
---
Yeah don't have the recipe either but have one in inventory. Stacked with psychotats would be nice. Condition has improved since the last patch so go for it. I use luck of the draw too at queen but it goes off maybe twice.
---
Any picture? 
---
I've gotten a mask every time I've played it....must be a glitch
---
Funny you don't respond to the guy who gave you a well thought out response in the creative field calling out your arrogance. You ignore responses that give valid criticisms of your viewpoint. 
---
Find a group of players to dump them on, or build a new character for each wepon type
---
Honestly..... just add some fucking hard mobs. Add ghoul hord of 50 or 5× DeathClaw. Come on..... enemies are pathetic 
---
If you are on xbox I'd happily trade
---
I suspect the haters you encountered, don’t have the money/resources, or permissions to play the game, and are jealous that you can and they can’t?
---
It’s a passive aggressive way to transfer their anger and frustration to you, while  making you feel insecure.
---
If it was me, I’d have taunted them and taken  condescending tone, till they were angry enough to fight, or frustrated enough to leave. As long as  they’re out of my face. Lolz
---
Did you build all that or just the house on the end?
---
I run 3 star cavalier + assasin / unyielding mix.
---
I dont get 1 hit unless they vats crit me or im stopped. DR is trash in PvP so your babrarian is worthless anyway... I dont use it.
---
I do a bloody-lite where i keep my health around 50%. Im able to output 1000 dmg at 50% health which goes up to about 1700 as my health drains.  Still pretty tanky due to my armor... I onty need 2 unyielding pieces and a wisky to keep my STR around 28.
---
I feel like 2h should be in a disadvantage against unarmed. Im ok with it. Just like some ranged builds beat others.. Shotgun va sniper for example.
---
I think out builds lenf us to different experiences which is a good thing. 
---
If you want the game to mimic real life, where unarmed should be more rogue-ish and 2h should be tankier...  It makes sense i guess. Maybe ad a 2 star effect for 2h ( +150 DR/ER)
---
IMO the main problem with PvP is low healthpool, END being so weak, &amp; DR being completely useless next to % mitigation from top tier armor. 
---
How different would the game be with 1000 pt health pools, END having 15 points worth of mitigation skills (instead of crappy survival perks like water quenching thirst longer) and DR from armor tripled .  heck a perk in endurance should be (armor rating is doubled) 
---
Actual tanks would be nice. Skills that buff mitigation while reducing dmg please!
---
Hahaha they're a weird tomato potato hybrid that's something kinda like potatoes with ketchup
---
No, it is one of the 5 that drop pretty often
---
I've been keeping records of my runs in a spread sheet, I believe I have seen Old Man Winter. Never the less the drop rates are insane.
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TtN90YthXEB3NOpkNuzLhCcIcq9ZDXsS5qswYROcM9g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TtN90YthXEB3NOpkNuzLhCcIcq9ZDXsS5qswYROcM9g/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Too bad you can’t mod the critter with reactive plates.  I recently added this mod and some dickweed tried to gank me (unsuspecting) with a deathclaw gauntlet and he paid the price.  Best part was homeboy was mic’d up and all I heard was a groan and “shit!!”  
---
I use my excavator armor and can care 425. I take out the weapons I need for weight, any junk over that is fine if I lose. 
---
So assuming my weight is 1225/1225, I don't mind just dropping extra junk.
---
I got the confetti pile plan but can't find where to actually build it, anyone know? 
---
I suppose unfair would be the wrong word. For me; it’s more about what kind of game do we want to play. Yes everyone can use stealthboys, but everyone already uses speed demon and marsupial, do we want everyone jumping and moving at superhuman levels as well as invisible? It’s just sort of something I don’t want. And this is exactly what happens when someone activates a stealth boy
---
I have both and seems electrically charged occurs about 5x more often than unstable isotopes. 
---
Can you post screenshots?
---
Thank you. I’m guessing the gun want all too great if it was sold to a vendor in the first place
---
No, just a lot of virtual high fives, complaining, and trading lol. 
---
I'd prefer that all the weapons currently in the game are tweaked first so they all serve a use and function correctly.
---
This is a super helpful card, especially when you’re mid-level in this game and still gets rads all the time
---
There are several guides on this Reddit about effective farm routes for different resources.  I'm level 91 and just now getting the hang of how to be efficient with everything I need.
---
west tek and monster mash events are insane xp
---
Bump..
---
His parents won’t let him play, till his grades improve. Grounded..
---
I think like 3 people here on Reddit are confirmed to have a rare mask 
---
Drink some vintage nukashine and go back to your safe space
---
Don’t feed the trolls..
---
Beautiful!  I wanna come there
---
It was just a barrage of pipe pistols and black powder rifles. They were all shooting me at the same time.
---
You almost always get a mask.  But it’s always the five common masks.  (Toothy, Owl, Witch, Giant, and Soldier)  There are supposedly 5 very rare masks that only a small handful have reported getting.  No one can actually confirm them dropping other than Bethesda saying “all can be acquired, working as intended, come back next year if you don’t get a rare one!”
---
I’m honestly hoping...(and I think it’s heading that way)....that Bethesda is going to add seasonal content like they did when fallout shelter came out.  Would be so simple, add one seasonal event with some decent esthetic drops, fun community events with legendary drop possibilities.  Just like the current one.  As we have all seen it brings together the community and as far as I’m concerned that’s great!!...assuming we don’t all get disconnected from the server lol!!
---
Damn- always platform mismatches!  I’d gladly swap you some stuff if you were on PS4. Well, I’ll pass on some radaways to a level 15 player in your honor :)
---
Less so than people crouching in a cave somewhere and wedging a key to spin in place. I’m totally fine with making people *work* to survive. 
---
Do you know of the mini nuke planter is also fixed? I know the campfire was but idk about the planter
---
i don’t think there is a plan for a pole hook, been looking for months now with no results. for the mod though i found 2 at the camden park vendor 
---
You've not experienced a SINGLE bug.  I call bullshit dude.  You cannot play, even now, for ten minutes without at least a visual bug.  Physics items hovering in the air.  Enemies still regain health occasionally, textures loading badly or not at all, and its literally impossible to play without enemies clipping through geometry.  Maybe you're so used to clipping in BGS games that you don't think of that as a bug but it is.
---
They've improved a lot of the problems and got it reasonably stable but it's still aBGS game.  At best it's now only as buggy as a regular BGS game as opposed to being the buggiest game in their catalogue.
---
2 has full health and the other had I’d say in the 60% Range
---
Probably something with the DLC. Isn't it one of the places on the new startup movie that plays behind the main menu? They also have the frat house for the nukashine quest, and Helvetia. Seems like that would mean it's gonna be a focal point soon.
---
Also, the marathoner perk makes encumbered running take fewer AP, I havent seen much about it and I'm not sure if many people know. 
---
They added more damage to heavy weapons when they buffed energy weapons
---
&gt;they could easily rebalance this if they took the time.
---
They don't have the time and they won't do it.
---
I have electrically charged, unstable isotope and reactive plates. I’ve jacked up a number of critters and players with this setup.  It works particularly well when some slappy tries to pick a fight with you.  Reverse one shots are the best.  
---
Only the last one you use is active.
---
But are they now endgame viable?
---
I feel like “gang, clan, tribe” would be more appropriate for post apocalyptic theme
---
I couldn’t stand to see and hear dogmeat cry in FO4.  So I gave him his house next to mine, would leave food before I went out. Lolz silly I know but that dog looked soo freakin real. 
---
Yep \^
---
Yass!  I want a Fallout Gang!!
---
Griefers arent rpers
---
What platform? I've got a lvl 50 3* for sale on Xbox. 
---
They should do it before I start working there.
---
I always crouched :) Cant stand up until stash limit increase and scrap legendary gears
---
Okay that’s 400 caps in total 
---
Wow I messed up my first Reddit Post ever, next time I need to put it as a question.
---
My Gatling laser and Gatling plasma do just fine for the SBQ and all her minions... as far as PvP tho I haven’t tried
---
I’m sorry, you’re right how stupid of me. The game works fine. I most have the only copy of fallout that doesn’t work. 🤙
---
TIL there is rad storms 
---
Most of the time the high levels just want to PvP, just fast travel away.  Usually they won’t complete the capture.  When you go back to collect resources just sneak so they don’t see you on the map at the workshop.  
---
Ok, thanks for your answer.
---
And for me it’s the opposite 
---
its all good, btw apparently nuka paint doesnt add defense, so that claim of mine was false, but i still wanna test out the stimpak spam. and no worries, have fun and keep working hard! hope u have a good weekend!
---
I gotten mask every time but only twice , and only the 5 basic ones over and over ( 28 hrs worth of masks )
---
I’ve had three same issue since launch. Tho it’s not every time luckily. Fraud I don’t have a fix except maybe go to the mall section then the mezzanine or
---
Yes, It's happened to me also. Pretty sure it's because someone recently killed them but the game tries to load them even if they are dead. Server jump and you are bound to get some that are alive and not bugged like that.
---
"I capture workshops all the time, and I participate in events and nuke launches frequently." well those things are bullet holes, so that explains why you never have bullets. :p
---
I haven't. 
---
well i have 3 two shot ones, Doesn't two shot freeze them faster? never tested.
---
Same. A little over 200 hours, only seen two.
---
You know, if everyone had it then it is not rare and it is nice having stuff in game being unique.  Let something be special in the game, they can be traded and will have great value.
---
Cool, I'll be on later tonight. GT is Kaise7en. 
---
I just discovered the Converted Munitions Factory so I was farming ammo. They weren't going anywhere lol.
---
Same here 
---
This is what they look like behind the monitor [https://imgur.com/Ctvvg42](https://imgur.com/Ctvvg42)
---
I love this,  lamo! I will up vote you because everyone else around here doesn't have a sense of humor! 
---
I would, but the game might not be able to handle the drinking animation and crash. 
---
It happens sometimes.. I personally think it's lag, or for some reason the server didn't register your sneak attack as sneak.
---
I've been trying, but it's difficult to convince 5-10 other people to let them die.
---
Man I can't recommend the Speed Demon mutation
---
Atom shop prices have to be balanced around the rate players earn Atoms through gameplay. In that regard, they’re pretty fairly priced. The Atom prices are fine, the Atoms/$ rate is the only thing that might need adjustment.
---
It would nice to be able to can things, but I still think we need a working refrigerator. I can farm cream at the creamery, but it doesn't last long.
---
I'm on xbox. I've been trying to buy the sign and letters plan forever 
---
I've been keeping track of my runs on a spreadsheet just in case anyone is interested.
---
Damn thats awesome, i wish you were on pc so i could come take a look around. I love the style of the rooftop area
---
Guess it wouldn't hurt to try
---
Still looking for veil of secrets anyone want to get rid of theirs?
---
I tried to mention this when it was first said and nobody wanted to hear it. The dataminer guy convinced everyone otherwise. 
---
Hey I'm about to get on in a bit do you think i could help you do it? I need a certain flower that has a guaranteed spawn in that quest and would greatly appreciate it.
---
Already tried.  This is day 5 of the event.  There isn’t much we haven’t tried.  1 left, 2 left, etc. appears to make no difference in rewards.  Chance for mask and plan each time.  
---
Hmmm. While I admire your confidence Google search immediately corrected to holier than thou. Top result for better than thou is a Spanish English dictionary... 
---
what about the weird issue where it shows initially i dealt full damage and like .1 seconds later the enemy regenerates like 50% of the health i dealt? 
---
This guy right here👆😂😂😂😂😂
---
I run a power armor/heavy guns build with a Vampire's .50-cal and a gatling gun. I've taken on four Scorchbeasts at once and taken them all out without needing stimpacks. As mentioned, heavy guns got buffed in the last patch. They were good when you specialized in them before, now they're awesome. 
---
Specialization is key - without the right perks, heavy guns are nowhere near as good, even after the patch. 
---
Agreed, that'd be really nice. 
---
👆This guy right here😂😂😂😂
---
Yeah
---
what are the effects? 
---
Maybe a hardware issue? I'm good here on pc. The bug that's stupid to me is the saved favorites one, but it's stable far as I can tell. Maybe a certain condition, I know one guy found he was crashing servers by running around with a 0% core in pa.
---
Me too! Said there was no point at all.
---
I’ve done it about 20 times and your numbers seem pretty on target. As an aside, your SPECIAL numbers don’t add up to 56. Am I missing something?
---
I have had the opposite. People seem to love my Vault Tec hoodie. Sorry that happened to you. 
---
Yes I do and on now 
---
You would probably need to add 6k caps at least in order to make the trade fair, just a heads up
---
What platform are you on? I can get you some help. I'm on Xbox. 
---
Nice! See you then
---
Luck and rarity should play a part especially with clothing items. Having something rare to aim for is good incentive. I understand it can be frustrating for some but the fact that a noob stands the same RNG chance as a veteran is brilliant.
---
I just crafted and scrapped a ton of combat armor, eventually got (I think) all or almost all of the mods. I also run a power armor build, so I scrap all non-legendary, non-powered armor parts anyway.
---
Keep scrapping, you'll eventually get deep pockets. How many scraps it'll take is anyone's guess. 
---
When they introduce backpacks, MothMan wings as a style choice would be even cooler!
---
Well thanks.
---
Lol!
---
What are the right perks (except for Heavy Gunner) of course
---
That would be interesting but gl convincing people in the event. Maybe have all common mask robots die.
---
Pretty sure only special stats are overwritten. Other effects should stack. 
---
That's because someone else probably has been 1 shot'ing it. I've been fortunate enough that most run throughs I've done, everyone was tagging it with lower level weapons, but a few times 1 person would just 1 shot it as soon as it came down the tree. Couple times ago this dude nuked everything. Everyone got on his case and his excuse was "only weapon I have on me is a mini nuke sorry hahahaha" and then left. What a dick. 
---
I agree. Ive been there man. . . 
---
When two PvP groups with top tier armor fight, it becomes some silly battle.
---
Invisible, glowing pink (Berry mentats), goofballs. Jumping and swinging at eachother. *Whifff whiff whiff whiff, KILL!!*
---
Thats the meta! Lol
---
A well geared/built heavy gunner on the team is the key... What wo is havr a sentinal clad sniper NOT go invisible and act as bait in that situation. Allows us to get the melee boys into one spot. 
---
Yeah I know, nothing comes without price, with mutation I am always water shortage.. and miss a lot player.setav codes :)
---
Rarity of this level on a limited time event is kind of ridiculous though.
---
Seems to be missing some balance between the two. 
---
Definitely couldn't be purified imo, boiled would be fine
---
That was infuriating to watch. He had to have seen the tag and figured it out. Glad you killed him. What an asshole.
---
What if the data miner guy was actually screwing with people, and telling them the opposite thing!? Conspiracy!
---
If an enemy has a closer opponent that's not stealthed, you don't get the sneak damage. I'm not sure it's 100% consistent, but that seems to be roughly how it works. It's a routine problem when playing with a team, but it's also visible when shooting into enemy vs enemy fights, and when fighting the SBQ.
---
Enemies getting their hp refunded after a short delay is probably caused by the game client and server not agreeing on the rules.
---
I think the client side gives you your multipliers, but the server side doesn't register it properly so it "corrects" it. This is only my theory though.
---
I have all of the common masks (Witch, Toothy, Owl, Giant and Soldier), most if not all of the decorations/recipes and beret in multiples after doing this even so many times that if I hear that song one more times I'm going to van Gogh my ears and send them to Bethesda in protest. I was starting to feel like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, but a lame boring longer version of Groundhog Day recast with Forrest Gump.
---
I just hope he's not a random spawn vendor. After server hopping like 40 times yesterday, took HOURS, getting the Charlston bot to pop was a PITA. And then after I bought stuff from him, I tried to hold him for other people and after one person made it, it just died. &gt;\_&lt;
---
It's in the Forest. That's not a high level zone.
---
Will buy the recipes I don't know gt Celticcrossbone
---
Same way you somehow magically get tatos in lunch boxes in bunkers that haven't been opened since the War?
---
2 things imo..
---
1. There are plenty of weapons in the game, they're just either so weak, break instantly or the ammo cost is too high to use them.
---
2. Adding an "anti material" or "m4" or some other badass gun to the game just means everyone now has to use that as it's the best one and no point using anything else.
---
100% agree. Would love to cause havoc with a gang of 10 raiders!
---
Half wish I didn't post this on the weekend because I know bethesda likely will not respond because of that. 
---
Shower
---
Same.
---
He couldn’t figure out what the variable was for the rare drops. Only the “chance” of one dropping. But something triggers the variable between common and rare within the “chance”
---
oh ok i understand, have u experienced this, or is it just me?
---
That's one place, cost is three tarberries per wine. That one place has four. Compare that to whiskey which just requires corn and razorgrain which can be grown in massive amounts at camps.
---
They scrapped that idea in favor of Survival mode, apparently.
---
I came from the future to say, thanks man! Seriously, this was a huge help!
---
RIP in peace big guy!
---
CAN i just say I LOVE THIS IDEA...no pun intended...or was it ?  lol..   
---
MAKE IT SO !  its perfect!
---
I believe you can make it if you look at the computer down stairs. 
---
ohhh i see, makes sense. as for my sanity,  Do u also get the issue where the hp is refunded, or is it just me?
---
I think they meant the new survival mode.
---
I saw the fasnacht skull mask on a guy today on xbox1. He said he got it last night running the event and said they did nothing different.
---
If you’re on ps4 I can help you out once you make it out of the vault. But frankly it’s prob best to make it to level 10ish before you really start teaming up or having other people help you through- it’s a good way to get on your feet first and figure out some of the basics. 
---
Main advice I’d give is to collect lots of junk, scrap all the junk you collect (at any workbench), and put all your junk in your stash frequently (junk is the only thing you drop when you die). It’s fine to focus on ranged weapons, but have a couple trusty melee weapons for when you get mobbed by ghouls or other fast enemies that get hard to hit with rifles. 
---
Beyond that, you’ll prob be low on food, water, and stimpacks early on. Horde what you can, and heal up by sleeping in a bed instead of using stimpacks (when possible). Once you get the hand of that, you’ll start collecting stuff faster than you use it.
---
Enjoy :)
---
That's a shame it would be nice if factions played a bigger part in the game
---
Its it just me...or do they always seem to land this way...on the green?  #holeinone!  
---
Unarmed is the strongest because of the unarmed mutation. Without that the 3 are pretty much the same
---
Stabilized, One Gun Army. Any ammo crafting perks will also be heavily used. Don't forget Scrapper because it doubles the steel returns since the last patch.
---
I have found myself using the beer way more often than I ever use chems. I just wish they weighed less. 
---
And you don't have to do the brewing, out side it's quests. So....don't? 
---
I completely agree. I have been saying that since launch.
---
You can't get into building to craft without the mask
---
Oh, you poor, sweet, summer child...
---
Check the fabricator 
---
I think a point alot of people are missing is, if you can bring in your old toon, what will you even be doing in PVP? The main reason I want to start a new character in a new mode is to have something TO DO in this game, and if everyone else was a new character, they would be off doing something too. If I bring in my old character, bored as hell, all quests done, ill be...idk..searching for anyone to murder i guess? 
---
Lol somebody's hashbrowns they left out that mutated in the Great War
---
Pretty much
---
I'd love that. Picture frames, too. 
---
Can you craft more than one?
---
Oh I get it all the time! Generally it happens the more chaotic the fight is, like with multiple kinds of mobs and whatnot. Scorched Beasts fights do it a lot for me too, especially those defend the turret events.
---
Shouldn't be a problem. But I won't be on till later tonight. 
---
What's a duper?? Like a trickster or something?
---
My brother has his camp in the Savage Devide and very often when you fast travel to his base the FWM will spawn in. Try moving your base?
---
I have never tried.  I know when I did my quests the computer down stairs gave access to the recipe to make a new one at home.  
---
It’s weird I got the mask off the ground at fort defiance.
---
Ok cool thanks 
---
I believe it was +50% limb damage, I'll have to look at the rest. Can't remember if it was bloodied or anti armor. 
---
Add Sniper King and message me when you are ready
---
Wow thanks guys! Really appreciate this. It will help immensely.
---
5 days and zero legit drops. Pretty sure at this point everything has been tried.
---
excellent post!....This event was all about fun...our 1st event together!    Do I want the masks?  absolutely... if I don't get them all ...it just gives me something to look forward to  next years Fasnacht! 
---
No they shouldn't. They're in FO4 because of the glowing sea. I see no reason why the same kind of storm should be in 76.
---
Check!
---
This really did save a lot on space.
---
There are lots of things need and lots of bugs I’m 2 levels higher than my buddy and he can tame wolves where as I can not
---
oh baby your a life saver, Literally! Whenever i get this bug i always jump off a cliff in the game.
---
Got it! I'm already having a blast!
---
I added an XO-1 jet pack pic which is $8 above in links
---
Yeah I did read a post by someone else on there being little hope on them being dropped, I’m just wondering if people are thinking the same thing. 
---
Working at intended. Keep playing, thank you for your interest.  Come back next year!
---
Thank you helpful poster from yesterday!
---
 Weapon balance. My knives when working at max potential with my rather good stealth, perked, Chameleon, and most important my tactics, kill everything they touch. That they can touch a surprising amount of foes in a very short time is the point of Combat Knives. I trigger hordes onto a doorway say and kill everything in that horde effortlessly.  Big piles to look through but life can be hard sometimes. ;)
---
 This is not well understood. ;) The Deathclaw fists are.
---
Ok figured it out. It was in fact plans and I applied them. Had to look a while longer. Thanks for the replies
---
Our best guess is that the coding for the event is broken where the chance for getting the reward is so small that there has only been 1 person recorded with a rare mask (sun). There’s a previous upload by another user showing a chart. If I find it I’ll link to it. 
---
Damn PS4
---
If you've already completed the quest the strangler bloom shows up at night behind Dyer chemical.
---
Yeah I haven't gotten them for finding places in each Region, either. 
---
All the robots have to have 100% health  by the end of the event
---
I’m on Xbox as well, just pm me your gamertag
---
So then about that tato juice.......
---
I was doing Crash Course and the Scorched spawned above the crashed plane on the cliff. They’d all jump down and die instantly. 
---
Boo! Boo Wendy Testaburger
---
I mostly use melee weapons when it comes to stuff like that 
---
While not confirmed in any way, it's been estimated that the rare ones from 1 in every 3333 masks.
---
So...run a bit more than 3000 events, and you'll have a 50:50 chance of finding 1.
---
Again, not confirmed, but that' the only number I've seen thrown around.
---
so cement in a can. 
---
Yeah, my first character was a stealth sniper. I played mostly with a team and this was common. Particularly obvious in silos for some reason, maybe because you change relative distances a lot.
---
Excellent idea though the stash is so full anyway, still could be good. Maybe like Skyrim crafting were you can discover ingredients and come up with new recipes which give different attribute point / health / special benefits. Then you can the recipe and trade them or eat them. If you create a unique recipe then it automatically gets written down and you can sell it.
---
It depends on the level of the creature compared to yours, and they have to be a random spawn and not tied to a particular area.
---
Agree but this list is a bit strange. "3 of the same and of course the Mega gun."
---
You have to melee it into chunks. It freezes standing up but if you chunk it up, you can loot the pieces. 
---
Intersecting object limitation for environment objects is killing my mojo hard. My workarounds always end up looking worse than 'suffering' through a corner of a structure being in a mountainside. I get it for crafting stations or useable objects but not for walls, roofs or foundations. 
---
Please Bethesda, trust us with our creativity creating more good than bad here.
---
Bandolier (makes heavy ammo lighter) 
---
Bear Arms (makes an M2HB lighter than a pistol) 
---
Bullet Shield (optional but may be useful depending on your armor)
---
Lock and Load (faster reload, really only useful for heavy guns other than Gatling, it already has a fast reload)
---
Gunsmith (no-brainer for any gun build but especially useful for fast-breaking heavy guns)
---
Weapon Artisan (helps those heavies last longer before breaking) 
---
Ammosmith (apart from Gatling, heavy guns burn through ammo crazy fast, this helps keep them happy) 
---
Bloody Mess (extra 15% damage is always useful)
---
One Gun Army (a 12% chance to stagger or cripple a limb is really handy with rapid-firing heavies) 
---
Super Duper (goes with Ammosmith to keep your guns fed)
---
I took Scrounger early on, but it's been my experience that .50-cal and 5mm ammo doesn't spawn that often, so unless you're rolling the MG-42 and need more .308, I'd skip it.
---
Nice mask ;)
---
Will they actively bloom or if i show up and they are buds I'm screwed 
---
You say you read the notes in the mine and found the paraphinalia, but are you sure you found everything in the mine? Dont want to spoil anything for you but you might not have explored absolutely everything inside it.
---
Ok, appreciate this man. Also I think I saw a discussion on whether or not the coding for the event was broken, I saw it on a YouTube video made by Juicehead I think it was. 
---
Some guy had a level 50 barbed pole hook with a mod that got around a certain percentage of armor, he wouldn’t sell it, The mods are a start thanks
---
My GT is Kaise7en
---
yeah probably, thanks for the response! Definetly makes me more "happy", or relaxed more like, now that i know its not just me. 
---
Yeah campfire tricks don't work anymore. 
---
Brave for admitting to willingly buying duped items online
---
Will get to doing the event then if that’s the case, but thanks for the numbers on it. 
---
This is a great idea; also want to see a “hardware bench” for making screws, springs, and add variation via different metals for different purposes. E.g. black titanium for PA springs, aluminium for guns. 
---
Could even go deeper and tie crafted material to durability. Aluminium pipe rifle is lighter but less durable, black titanium heavier but longer lasting. 
---
Tastes like ketchup yum
---
Wait till night, then fast travel there.  I had the same problem.
---
Unyielding armor at 20% health or less.
---
2nd time. First log on was the day it launched and I did no fighting, just the final rose quest. The card I leveled up was dodgy in agility. 
---
It’s possible I had egg head in a bugged state with no stat impacts or ui display. That’s the only explanation is if they fixed something about the bug state, causing it to appear like I silently mutated even though I have immunity
---
I have a group of 8 people that have been farming them since the first day. We have tried everything. Tried every combination of decorations, logged which robots spawned, and what the rewards were. There is no correlation. I have seen 0 hard proof that the masks exist as legit drops in game. 
---
Hmm, you're picking up every lead thing you find, right? Using the Ammocrafter and Super Duper perks?
---
Ketchup and starchy potato water
---
Thats literaly the eorst part of it. Wtf
---
Yes, I am 
---
Don’t get too excited seeing no one can get the mask from this event lols
---
Black powder rifle is very high damage, and it gets scaled to level in PvP I think.
---
Aside from the excellent advice above, I'd recommend reading up on perk builds and experimenting with a perk builder before you level too far. This can save you a lot of time and headache by avoiding perks that won't fit your build. Yes, you can reallocate SPECIAL points after  level 50, but this can take forever depending on how many points you want to move around.
---
Dude that would be an awesome idea! They could switch out that fucking mega sloth with a DeathClaw or how about a behemoth. Why is the behemoth not getting any love in this game? There are no epic events in this game. One of our buddies hasn't purchased the game yet, but was watching us on a stream and asked us why he should get it (this is long after I have done everything you can in game before the last update) I couldn't think of one reason. I just keep playing at this point because I have to platinum (PS4) this game. F03 Collectors &amp; Platinum, FO NV Collectors &amp; Platinum  &amp; F04 Collectors and Platinum, F0 76 Collectors and two trophies away from platinum this  one. I loved this franchise, but I think I might burn all my F0 shit in effigy (one more fasnacht reference)
---
People show up late and wait for it to end so they can smack the sloth (irony alert) and collect their mask
---
Where is this hard proof of the sun drop? Until I see a vid of screencap of one showing during the rewards screen then I won’t believe it. Plenty of people have things in the game that they didn’t get legitimately 
---
You can't get these by scrapping. Some armor mods are scrap unlocks and some are drops only. An old list of scrap unlocks that still seems to be accurate:
---
[https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png](https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png)
---
You can find Deep Pocketed Combat plans occasionally at some world spawns, but they're extremely rare.
---
I’ve had his with my shotgun. It deals decent damage then about a third of that damage regenerates. It’s odd
---
Damm, if what your saying is true then I guess there’s very little way information and ways left of getting the masks. Have you tried having certain robots die?
---
Pretty sure I've randomly seen them for sale in Harper's ferry and some other shop further north, but it was very low level. Maybe Grafton? Have also seen them spawn in the small town in the mountains to the east of whitesprings. If you fast travel to Solomon's lake (or is it lake Solomon?) And head towards the water tower, turn West once in the town. Look around the front of the last building just before the power armor station, there is usually a random weapon spawn there (there are also 2 safes, a magazine spawn, power armor spawn, a minigun spawn, and several workbenches around this area).
---
I had good experiences with VATS and automatic rifles. I would try to focus on either automatic or non automatic due to perk cards. 
---
Pretty sure that they where trying to do that with the levels. higher levels being made out of higher quality materials and production. 
---
Boo
---
No prob.
---
I bought the caps to see how easy it was. I didn't buy any items, way out of my price range lol  
---
I bought the caps and in less than 10 minutes had a message to meet them at a train station. On the site which is literally published on most Fallout 76 YouTube videos you can buy them.   
---
I did it to show how easy it was...   
---
In order to sell these items especially junk you have to either actively farm which takes away from every player playing today or they are duped which has been a huge issue.   
---
I'm also grinding my ass off to get that tiny little wall flag, because it looks like a medics symbol, and I want to use it to maybe show people, "hey I have lots of aid items to help you" lol
---
XP buff is a bit much, that's treading on P2W territory. I don't want any atomic shop items affecting gameplay in the slightest.
---
Guess I stand corrected. It's entirely possible that I picked up the deep pocketed plans and didn't think much of it what with the power armor build.
---
Plot twist: it's OP's website
---
Wish they would add the Wanderer from fallout 4 but I doubt they’ll ever be able to use it again since dion tried to sue them 
---
The only reason most people must rely upon vats in melee is lag. It's the only way to guarantee you actually hit them. I've pummeled people and had nothing happen until three seconds later while I wasn't even attacking. Lag is your best defense against melee. 
---
I actually didn’t think of this, people just glitching then in, I would also like to see them getting dropped in the rewards at the end. 
---
Can't get in without a mask
---
Doesn't have to even be a team member. Been doing the new parade event solo and the purple cloud pops up when someone eats one and I'm in the area.
---
I’ve seen some come out of the tubes normal and the start to glow green.  Born average and then become...legendary.
---
And be more dangerous
---
Not specifically. I have had a various number of them die, but it’s just too tough to get certain ones to die. Especially when your doing the event with a handful of fandoms. We have had one instance where the only surviving bots were wearing the rare masks though.
---
[https://youtu.be/gDNFmUbT820?t=1625](https://youtu.be/gDNFmUbT820?t=1625) it's what you can hear in the background, but I couldn't find any 'clean' extract. I'll check your link !
---
Oh dang that's cool. I will have to try that. 
---
There are pics of folks wearing the backbacks already...
---
I have a friend that was throwing around the same idea but I think the problem with that theory is that not all the rare masks will spawn on the robots. I've run the parade about 40+ times and not once has a robot spawned wearing the old man winter mask. I think that alone kind of disproves the theory. On top of that, the devs have already stated that it's in your best interest to keep all the robots alive if you want to max out your chances at receiving a mask.
---
Sure; but linking it to component choice rather than level would open that world up to all. Personally I would like to see resources the thing that controls access to higher level crafting rather than level. Always a little jarring to be L40, find a L50 version of the fun you are using but can’t use...
---
Who's website? I followed it after watching a few video walk troughs and saw this. Who is connected with it? 
---
West Tec was working on mutated plants before the bomb fell, the remnants are still there and lootable
---
I’m pretty sure the worst part is the 0.00001% chance of getting a rare mask. Just trying to make it a fun grind...
---
I do agree that it is hard to get certain ones to die, I’m going to try and convince people to let ones die, and do it specifically as hard as that will be, and I’m gonna try record the data. 
---
To sneak back for your junk......that area's still considered hot!  LOL
---
“Disaapeared into a puddle”  vicar of dibley reference anyone?
---
Congratz
---
Before patch 5 you could also buy them at the Grafton vendors for peanuts, although the chance of them showing up wasn't great. Some missions or treasure maps might also drop them.
---
I believe you, but pics would be cool.
---
What system are you on?
---
Wow u are prolly right
---
I did it and it worked 
---
I am on Xbox 1
---
Honestly, if they would just toss us the drop rate percent for the mask I think everybody would be somewhat satisfied.
---
I understand they're busy, but I can't see why they couldn't be a bit transparent and give us the percents.
---
I really like the structure of this update. They're rolling out new things each week, slowly working up towards the more substantial and game-changing aspects.
---
It gives me new things to try out along the way, while still keeping me excited and looking forward to the next bit of content.
---
For me, the messiness of the first few months has been worth it.
---
it is extremely odd. any annoying haha! atleast we arent the only ones
---
People are still duping. It's just a well kept secret on how they do it so they can keep selling the same OP armor for insane caps. 
---
I like just throwing orbital strikes everywhere.  Take that rad toad!
---
What’s the moon one with the missile in the eye? I saw it on two different people today... I only get owl, giant, toothy, soldier and witch.
---
Bleh, lame. Lol... yeah the poor sloth dies instantly while the dogs or stingwings are left to murder defenseless robots, I just ignore the sloth and handle them personally when i do it now.
---
I didn’t say hard proof just that one person recorded with the sun mask who claims they got it legit. Didn’t mean to say it was, sorry
---
Let’s do this. GT: slimjim72384
---
Then make it a non combat buff. But one that throws confetti around. 
---
I bought some Jumbo tie Mr Fuzzys from a kind vendor once... Didnt see any on your list, and I cant find any information about them... They are jumbo sized mr fuzzy bears
---
I've also seen him wander down the nearby alley to fight the Watoga protectrons, so if he's not behind his counter or in the wall, check the alley with the stairs.
---
I keep hearing people refer to “VATS teleportation” by melee fighters and I think that’s just people playing with shitty connections. I run a direct wire connection and only had this issue when I unplugged and used a WiFi connection. 
---
No worries man. I’m hopping they got it legit and there’s hope for the rest of us, but until I see it from the rewards screen
---
It's not just a PvP thing.  Super Mutants, in particular, are pretty fond of blocking melee attacks.  That obnoxious behavior is why I tend not to use Slow weapons anymore, unless than have that swing speed bonus.
---
Gangs (Raiders), Tribals (Villagers/nomads), Vault Dwellers (obvious).
---
Fallout's got a few terms for different groups.
---
There's really no reason for them to even be in 76. We only experienced them in Fo4 is because of the Glowing Sea. Being inside a nuked area is pretty much the equivalent of them anyway.
---
Great list.  Forgot buttercup horse thing though for misc toys
---
But did you try using only metal or wood steins instead of the much more common porcelain ones?
---
I got money it will be a future update. They have more than just survival mode in the works. 
---
Agree, but its not rare because only questionable post of two or three people out of millions of player only have one and the only one that these two people have are the Old Man Winter mask and not the other "rare" mask. WTF?  And it has been said that if they do have the mask it's from the dev room. Rare shit is cool, but if it's so rare someone will offer 500 dollars in real money for it that isn't cool. 
---
All this is for cash not caps... one of my questions is this:
---
If a player buys all their armor and weapons if they have the cash, isn't that the same as a player buying duped items in game for caps? 
---
There's just no way these items aren't duped. 
---
As far as caps go I bet they are selling duped items at all vendors through numerous characters! 
---
Yeah, but it makes sense when people believe what they so doesn't influence the outcome.
---
No one gets the rare masks, and the commons reliably drop even if you do very little.  Especially the plans, which have become more interesting than the masks 'cause you get more variety with them...  because half the masks are practically unobtainable.
---
Great event, but needs a scaling tweak to keep it from going sour
---
 Very sorry for the delayed response, my family flew in to visit me last night, and will be here for the weekend, normally I am quite active, and quick to respond!
---
Ooh are you built on top of bridge or under bridge? I love that spot! You are right, I should do that! I’m not too familiar with imgur but I’ll learn real quick to upload some photos! 
---
If you ever have any questions on the spot I’d be happy to chat over discord and talk through the build!!! 
---
I can next Friday but know their worth at least 200
---
I do! If you look at my Xbox profile, my screenshots are all organized into a portfolio of sorts! 
---
I'm sure they are using the same methods. It's very common in online games. Pretty much every game has this problem which sucks. 
---
Saw /u/TeethFaceTV wearing it; but alas, he traded for it
---
I mean, honestly they don’t care.  They did say it’s working correctly.  They did say just keep doing it and basically hope you get it, if not, trade or try again when/if it comes back in a year.
---
They won’t change anything.  It’s day 5 of 7.  And you know how fast they are to talking to players about their concerns.  
---
How much for the minigun two shot? 
---
The bots are timed to die at select points so the tubes don’t over populate the city. 
---
Watoga is a gold mine, numerous bobbleheads, magazines, and the fact these protectrons turn legendary is the the icing on the cake. Certainly my favorite place to be.
---
No, it’s quite true. It is a legacy mechanic from fallout 4 that allows you to cover the last bit (7-10ft or so) distance in an instant.  
---
I have my xbox wired as well.
---
What masks are considered rare?  I got one today, think it was called "toothy man" 
---
This is actually true.
---
5k
---
Yes.  It’s part of the mission.  You learn about them and where they are coming from.  
---
And that, right there, is the problem and reason why I stay away from PvP. 
---
Hey I know I’m not op but can I get one?
---
Glory days are over my friend. Survival mode solves all these issues. Along with pacifism extending to camps .
---
Ibh i was presenting a situation i commonly face: angy pve players reaction to forced PvP.
---
See my other reply in this thread regarding rediquette. (Cryptically implying i'm not really bothered by the verbal response of the PvE player).
---
I just wanted to present situation to the PvE community on reddit in order to provoke a conversation. I wanted to gauge their empathy  for raiders, raiding and forced PvP. Something that was included in this game, advertised and sold to players like me. 
---
The commonly upvoted opinon is "Fuck griefers". From my perspective, raiding isnt griefing; griefing can only occur AFTER a raider follows you into a new server.. once you server hop to get away from the raider. (Please dont argue this, its fine if you disagree, im tired of having this conversation on reddit). 
---
I wanted to see if people undertood raiding and forced pvp were an intended feature in this game, not some mistake bethesda made that we were exploiting. People deny this left and right around here. (Again Bethsda is removing it soon, so it doesnt matter anyway).  
---
Anywho, thanks for the comment.
---
nah I'm good, I've seen it go for 1.5k and I'd be okay at two but I can wait otherwise.
---
If we do, they'll literally just be reskinned robots.
---
Had 2 inside, but one bugged completely out, just flew through walls and the ground. Didn't really hit anything, but couldn't hit it as well.
---
Ok good luck
---
Also, the new vegas casinos and the augmentations at the clinic were quite an awesome combo.
---
It's what got me to max out luck for the first time and dear god it was worth it.
---
Radstorms only really happen in the forest because that's where all the nuclear power plants are. Storms spawn from them rather frequently (if you look into the distance you can see a thick bright green cloud rise up from the chimney things and then the whole sky will turn green as the storm comes in)
---
Why wouldn’t you leave the world or turn on passive mode? 
---
I dont see an issue. Appalachia just feels so devoid of life and it would be cool opportunity to see it recovering somewhat.
---
Try to find one of the worn veils that you needed to start the quest to get into the building and use the fabricator. I got mine around Camden park.
---
Uh yeah 
---
These are random encounters.
---
On automatic guns it’s not too helpful. I mean it’s better than not having it.  the 15% is too high to recover durability. 
---
Workshops.
---
I like rarity in some items. But to only have one or two possible drops in the entire event is stupid. 
---
I didnt know things could become scorched in combat. Everything ive come across has been pre-scorched.
---
They can still attack you on passive mode and why should we have to leave the world? Shouldn't the bastard sons of bitches that act like rabid animals have to leave instead of people just trying to play the damn game? 
---
4 also was... frustrating. Lots of areas where you could feel there was more to be done (the race track and the combat zone, to name only a few well-known ones). A bit like new vegas' cut content, only more widespread
---
Already completed the mission veil does not respawn
---
I saw them a couple times. Pretty rad man.
---
That would be awesome! My guy has only ever known the taste of Purina.
---
Sounds about right, but I have like five of each maybe more and stopped counting. If they just kept it at the five common masks that would have been cool. That's 20+ hours of my life I will never get back. ATP I feel like I was lied to because it feel like for all my effort it was for not. Feel the same? 
---
BRB have to run down to the store and buy a bag of pull tab tickets fingers crossed I'll win a 1,000,000$$ and be able to buy that Joker mask. I really want that joker mask!
---
Atomic shop
---
Well, you're out of luck. He's back. And some settlements need saving.

Owl mask is the only one I don’t have and, coincidentally, the one I wanted most since they were leaked. 
---
I need closure on the ballad of Butcher Pete!
---
I wish we had more than three types of ballistic shotguns. And we only have what, two automatic ballistic pistols? I know laser, plasma, and Tesla guns can be made into those types but I can count 6 types of non auto ballistic pistol alone off the top of my head
---
Roger that.
---
Big ol whoosh
---
Then I dunno. If you're not using ammo, and you're making lots of ammo, then I have no idea why you don't have ammo. 
---
Oh OK, that is a good idea.  Thankyou.   On a side note, I have now learned that of you switch a excavator reactive plates to medic pump, the RP mod disappears.  Poof!
---
But they won't, so perhaps the smart thing to do is leave?
---
You sound like a whiny little girl. 
---
Hit me with a link
---
Would be cool if the drop was rare for a "perfect" *insert monster here* pelt or head that would be in turn used as the main material for these mounts
---
At recieving A mask. Not any mask. That's my theory. The more chance of you getting z rare mask the more chances of you getting a mask at all go down 
---
Well I use ammo in certain situations, I’m just saying I use my melee more 
---
Oh god, 10 year olds playing Fallout. Why. Like literally why. Every time I'm griefed it's some 12 year olds yelling foul language at me lol. 
---
Every single time since the last update
---
I look for serum mI look for serum mutation healing factorutation healing factor
---
Don't be.
---
I'm content....
---
I don't like the condition aspect. It should have planet food longevity once it's canned. 
---
Also I don't have a hard time keeping fed in the game. I'd much rather they work on additional quests, weapons, and different craftables than this.
---
Only take out the one TD at a time, and don't loot the other desks. There are what, 25 desks in there, maybe even 30. That means you can with server hopping do 25-30 TD  a refresh cycle. 
---
 u need armor with 50% fall reduction for more epic hero landing xd
---
I literally havent. For some reason i havent even experienced normal betheshit bugs. Its fuckin weird, cause i went in hoping to have hate evidence, but i havent got any.
---
Nope it's just you. Everyone I know has at least one jester, goblin, pirate and sun mask and just a matter of time til someone gets the old man winter mask and Jesus Christ nobody knows and if we did I don't think we'd tell you.
---
Don't worry, these 10 year olds no longer play. So, you just have to worry about the rest.
---
Yeah I know only to take one at a time, I figured that out the hard way..
---
Problem solved. We did leave.
---
U do know the game is rated M right?
---
Unyielding boosts your SPECIAL Bloodied boosts your Damage.
---
Lol yup and I just got one of each during one single event. Swear
---
That makes it ok, right?
---
Really? 10 year olds playing online with strangers?
---
..... unyielding gives +3 to special when low health. That's not going to do more damage unless you melee since strength increases damage 
---
  I have personally done the event well over 20 times and I have never seen anyone equip any masks other than the owl, soldier, giant, witch and toothy man masks. I am beginning to think that either the other masks are really rare or Bethesda just plain forgot to add them to the event loot table.
---
and is killing this game for me.  It just dons't feel right or maybe dishonest to promise a rare item that is almost unachievable to obtain.
---
I hope Bethesda will be like ya we fucked up again and let us exchange our duplicates for a better chance at rare mask.
---
Top 10 fan theories that you need to listen to

Bethesda has been known to put the decimal point in the wrong place.  &lt;cough cough Bobby Pins weight&gt; &lt;cough cough Fog Crawler damage in FO4&gt;

---
&gt;went there, and all i find are "strangler pods"  not "strangler bloom".  do they come out at a specific time?
---
This, I think something changed my GF needs it for the daily, very frustrating.
---
Letting your 10 year olds play a game rated mature might not be the right thing to do. Understand your frustration but that is how BGS made the game. You already know the workaround, blocking and leaving for another server, so this is kinda on you. Toxic people are everywhere in life, need to find better ways to deal with it 
---
Characters are cloud saved to the account.
---
Nah, if you have good kids they shouldn't stop playing. Maybe you should just play with them, though. Could be a life lesson about empathy and not treating other people poorly. Good luck. 
---
Like GTA Online i'm pretty sure your character is stored in the cloud so it will be there when you get back on.

I’m built as a stealth marksman. I can down most small game and the likes. And while yes I can’t KO a deathclaw or Mirelurk queen or SB in record time. It allows me to adapt and learn. The core of survival. 
---
I run the full perk list of all the rifleman perks maxed, tank killer. Tenderizer in charisma, most of the stealth perks and tormentor in luck. 
---
Guns are suppressed instigating lever. Anti Armour gauss rifle. And currently a instigating laser rifle which will be swapped out for furious. 
---
A 10mm pistol for backup and revolutionary sword and power fist for in your face fights. 
---
That’s not a legacy mechanic. The old mechanic was actual teleportation. The new mechanic is increased sprint speed to target. I can replicate it with other character’s sprint without VATS or melee involved. Melee characters just seem to do it more often because they have to close distance with a sprint. 
---
I too think 4 has way more quests
---
West Tec was working on them pre bombs falling
---
100% legit and not from dev room?
---
Ok thank god. I stressed out about it cause I've put about 200~ hours in and endless hours making alcohol for my bar the past days. Now I'm just wondering why it ate itself. Do you happen to know what the problem was for the BETA? Where the PC data ate itself? Or would the PlayStation be doing this to like protect itself against corruption of some sort/to reinstate the game?
---
Zzz
---
I think PvE is too easy &amp; there isnt enough content. Even having a build for PvE doesnt make sense to me. You could tear through this game with just the woodchucker perk equipped! I rarely PvE, i'll be PvEing in survival mode though.
---
Im excited about the roadmap. More group content &amp; prestige system specifically address my concerns. Good job Bethesda!
---
Yeah if you have bloody mess slapping it will break the body. Or just fast traveling back to Helvetia will often fix it. 
---
The first few event I did went fine. No explosive weapons. No everyone has to show off their toys and hit it before it becomes targetable and mess it up for everyone. 
---
I hear you. It took a lot of effort to give away some of my guns. But if you're not using them, then what's the point? My stash box was full, I weighed a ton and couldn't fast travel or run. Losing all that weight made a world of difference.
---
I was really sad because my best friend did the same. We were really excited to play together and when we played in the BETA we both had a lot of fun but when it came out he just started complaining about it and he’s hardly touched it. 
---
Nuke Silos have a lot of tech data
---
No, and I use hack as a loose term. But you CAN exploit glitches/mechanics using third party mods. None of those things can bypass a Blade of Bastet with full MOM gear doing a tap check on a player with a bounty. I have 14 tap checks on 3skullz just standing in the open with a 10 cap bounty recorded, and a video of him teleporting, dozens of hits on him running around while I was invisible...   
---
Blade of Bastet with MOM set and Incisor maxed ignores 175% of armor (anything over 100% is superfluous). Gonna let Bethesda decide if it is sketchy or not. You two and your other two friends.
---
Just always looting enemies, searching containers, and picking up junk to craft with has worked for me. I generally have too much ammo and meds/chems. If your constantly launching nukes and stuff you’re going to be burning through a lot of stuff. Carry enough guns of different calibers that you can switch to things with more ammo. 
---
If you’re running out of ammo while still playing melee it’s beyond me what you’re doing. Do you only carry one or two guns? For meds I guess get shot less or start figuring out where the stuff needed to craft them spawns.
---
That very well could be the case too, makes sense. I've seen them self destruct having taken no damage at all.
---
There are screencaps of characters with a rare mask
---
Arnt we as well in 76 though ?
---
I like the idea, just not the idea of having another work bench. Incorporate it into the cooking stove or something. I don't have any more room for work benches. My brew stuff is on the roof of my quaint cabin because my patio ran out of room. 😁😁
---
I would love to see that glitch when they didn't die. 
---
I've been trying to follow this whole thing online and have run it about 110 times now and I'd be inclined to say the drop rate on the rare masks is either extremely low or broken. I've seen a few believable claims that they've tracked down and seen people who have the mask (not that they saw it drop though) and we've seen a few pictures but really very few. I don't really trust the "my aunt's uncle's cousin's babysitter's step brother's hairsylist had the mask drop" claims so much. I also notice no difference in what happens if some bots die aside from you having a chance of getting no mask.
---
I personally wouldn't mind human skinned bots, but I think most people assume they're going to like replace pre existing mobs and such with people and personally, Bethesda history considered, I doubt that will ever happen. 
---
That’s because a new legendary has spawned to take that ones place. It’s beautiful when you see it. About 3 days ago I was in an Xbox server and only had 5 people online.  The whole city was legendary. 6 3* and the of various ones. A good time. 
---
And now deleted your post. Seems like you may not be mature enough to play this game either
---
And u believe them? 😂😂
---
C'mon dude,
---
 "How come there hasn't been a SINGLE screenshot of the Fasnacht ***Reward screen*** showing a Rare Mask? "
---
You know, the thing at the end of the event with a cutesy little picture of Vault Boy that lists what rewards you got?
---
Your save data is saved separately from your game data
---
I never find bobble heads or magazines here.  I farm it all the time.  Am I blind?  Where are they?
---
Plus I NEVER see leg. protections glow green.  
---
Guilds in games traditionally give games more meaning and depth. The friends you make along the way help you maintain your interest in the game, sometimes long after you've gotten bored of the game. Half the reason I kept playing ESO as long as I did was because of the people I played with.
---
I can't even text chat my friends in the game without having to use a third party app like Discord, and as good as Discord is, it shouldn't be mandatory for any game.
---
They must have changed it because it did rain indoors previously. At least with the roof i used. Good fix tho, was annoying
---
In watoga it rains indoors for me lol
---
Ooh ty.

One Violent Night and AWOL Armaments. Bring friends to both events. Both locations, the sons of Dane compound and robco are great farming locations.
---
Oof
---
Why do people keep posting asking about this, there's like 50 threads about how no one can get them.
---
Oh gosh you're right there aren't any pictures of the rewards screen that appears for **only a few seconds** it must be a fucking conspiracy
---
I do One Violent Night once a day by myself usually unless other people show up. Are there good legendary enemies inside at Robco?
---
It’s all good lol
---
Let them spoil? 
---
There's rare, and there's literally impossible lol. 
---
I'm LVL 336 and really struggle to rank up once a day, never mind 3. Pretty silly really, and am getting really fed up with all the alcohol related challenges, could understand for a few days but enough with that now.
---
Done it with 2 and 3 down. Only difference was I got plans but no mask at all. 
---
I found that there’s usually 3-4 legendary ghouls in Fort Defiance and most of the time 1 of them is a 3*. A couple days ago I got a 3* Pole Hook with AA, 40% more power attack damage, and reduced weight. There’s also a good amount of straight jackets there that you can sell for 40 caps a piece.
---
Most likely from the dev room. Nobody in their right mind would trade the old man winter mask if it was legitimate.
---
Hi my friend, at higher levels, that weapon is not good..
---
Following that logic, i assume you must also believe the Earth is flat, even though there are pictures that suggest otherwise.
---
I have a dedicated screen capture key....where on the controller is that?!
---
It’s not so much about the armour and weapons. Yes it is to a fine point. But the often overlooked fact is the dupping generated a lot of fake weapons and things. The worst is the imaginary caps that make with it. 
---
You can nerf armour and weapons all day. The ones with a near endless flow of caps and mules will just listen for the next best trend and spend their way back up. 
---
Oh I doubt they'd do that. I was thinking more along the lines of having a new Respondsers camp. Maybe the lumber mill a but south of Vault 76? Its not being used for anything. 
---
But yeah, I would think it would be a stupid idea to replace what little characters we have now.
---
Rad storm should always happen once a nuke is launched. 
---
This says it all!
---
Dude radroaches open doors and they tear up your camp if you don't have turrets in doors
---
Robco always has some.
---
Don't fast travel to your camp! They'll come in and wreck it. 
---
I say again, bring friends. The more people there, they more enemies will show up. Legendary enemies spawn both inside and outside of RobCo. Kind of like WestTek. However the event always spawns a three star as the last enemy.
---
It's hard to know if it does. To say that things are rare, doesn't prove or disprove his numbers. As someone else posted, we don't know if they give  one away per day, one per 100 events, or if it's a random percentage. 
---
Some people are speculating that numbers of surviving robots are a factor. Others are speculating that the number of popped balloons may even come into play. 
---
There is no possible way that we can presume that the numbers of people who self-reported were accurate, or that they necessarily were an adequate sample to be predictive. 
---
You can downvote this as much as you want. I'm not saying that it's not impressive that some guy tried to to an analysis of the data, but you'd need a really huge sample to know if the data was meaningful. 
---
We could do an analysis of 10,000 hands of online poker. And maybe in that sampling, shows that quads got dealt 100 times when the odds would indicate that on average, we ought to see quads 16 or 17 times. Someone doing an analysis might assume that 1% of hands should flop quads. Someone else might assume that the system was bugged. 
---
Neither would necessarily be true. 
---
Now here is my question (and I promise I'm not trying to sound like a dick). What purpose would that serve other than "hey look we put humans in the game" ? 
---
must be. even people who have bugs can still play the game. for your game not to work at all, something else must be wrong.
---
They are just waiting to post them on the atomic shop... lol :(
---
I agree with OP... some of you might be too young to remember this term but, "Pics or it didn't happen!"
---
i need one of these masks! is this still a thing? has anyone seen these in-game? I NEED MORE INFORMATION!!
---
Can open doors....can't look behind some trees.... 
---
It's both terrifying and stupid at the same time some how.
---
Blame Youtube man, they've blown the game's problems so far out of proportion that it's unrecoverable.   
---
I get atleast one or two people every day slamming 76 without having even played it - Then ironically, they talk about the possibility of buying it. 
---
There are still things Fallout 4 does better.  The graphics of Fallout 4  are a lot more refined than they are in 76, which feel very experimental and WIP at times.  
---
76 has some good settlement/camp/building improvements, but it still lacks a greater incentive to actually build and make your mark on the world. I'd say 4 wins a bit here almost purely because of variety though, 76 still has a long way before we get some cool  new furniture and structure  items that can match Fallout 4.
---
Combat is mostly equal. 76 has more options, but still lacks a fair amount of  balance and weapon categories (no anti-materiel rifle, terrible pistol variety). Gore was toned down, and we can't do anything like pickpocketing enemies anymore.  Armor and defense balance is a bit wonky, lots of enemies have near-equal energy and  ballistic defense when it  makes no sense for them to, so lots of energy weapons aren't very useful like they would be in 4. And the  player armor curve is weird, where a top-of-the-line armor like marine armor is considered 'sturdy' by the game's standards, so even regular heavy combat armor outclasses it.  It was more well-defined in 4 than 76.
---
76 does survival almost 100% better than 4. It's more refined, has more recipes, and doesn't feel like an intrusive chore. And you're rewarded for staying well-fed. 
---
So much yes!!! Let me make my own cram!
---
Following the logic out of 3 systems(PC, XBOX, and PS4) not a single person out of the complete redit community has posted they got one.
---
But keep on believing there bud. When the event ends..you can feel like an earth is flat believer yourself. 😂😂
---
What 2 handed are you looking for? 
---
I think I have a 45 Anti Armor Grognaks axe.
---
Ah okay. I just remembered that there was one that spawns there, thanks for the info. Will have to check into it myself
---
Good thing we got locks!
---
The only reason I used the strategy I wrote is because I've kited Yao Guais like that before. Looks like something changed with Patch 7.
---
I noticed a scorch beast flying by during one. Tried to fire a shot at it, but it was too far away. I think a scorchbeast attack as the legendary megasloth attacks would be the ideal ending. 
---
Ugh just disrespectful after all those piano lessons this is what you get.

How can you scrap too much plastic, shot gun sheeeeelllls.

---
I almost always find them scatterred in Wataga and Harpers Ferry. Both places I do not look any desks, safes, or containers even if I really need the plastic 😂. Just server hop and I find em.
---
That’d be fine with me 
---
Yeah but it happens and there's rarely ever actual malice. It's just banter. They don't expect someone like OP to cry about it on a tumblr post or something. 
---
I didn’t say that it doesn’t work at all. I’m saying that I still have bugs that were in it ages ago. Killed by invisible ghouls, creatures not taking damage and suddenly regaining full health. Radiation killing me even though I’m in power armour, disconnecting from servers when fighting scorchbeast queen. But I can still play it, although I don’t know why I play it. Maybe I like torturing myself. 😩
---
It's even worse if a player kills them because as far as I can tell they don't respawn and continue to take up C.A.M.P. budget. Definitely bugged.
---
It's not that NO ONE has found one......
---
Maybe it's just that no one from the small sliver of player who frequent this sub has found one.
---
"Share" button on PS4.

Double tap Xbox Button and hit Y on Xbox One.

Super appreciate your detailed response! It's given me some ideas on where to go from here. 😃
---
I had a diseased death claw I called Grumpy. Was so stoked/annoyed every time I went back to my camp because he wouldn't stop attacking my base and making noise. One day Grumpy was gone for a long time and after the last patch I had a lame ragstag at my camp. I think Grumpy was replaced with a ragstag. I think Grumpy was the victim of a glitch. The animal perks are cool, but taming animals is why I maxed these out, but rare. All this rare shit is making the game lame because it is almost unobtainable. 
---
The boarding up thing happens to me every time, and normally takes a minute to become a door. 
---
Someone who duplicates items (for example TSE pump action shotguns), this causes server instability and usually disconnects people from the game
---
I noticed rain inside my mire camp the other day 
---
Unyielding is great for ranged if you're going to use VATS.  Perception for accuracy,  agility for ap, and luck for filling the crit meter.  The extra strength for carry weight is nice too.  It won't boost your basic damage though.
---
did a few server hops, and they appeared.
---
Lol, and most times it is just (10) atoms!!!
---
I'm just curious about a couple things, when he was turned "scorched" did his level go up? I'm assuming he was level 20ish when you first got him? Also, was he still moving with your camp/appearing any time you'd log in and remaining aggressive to camp objects?  
---
Just a side note but I made a deathclaw maze a couple weeks back and I was really curious if you could force the pet to be a higher level and keep it that way as I'd heard anecdotes about "level 91" tamed deathclaws but couldn't achieve one in practice.
---
They have always done this fyi watch the container from which they spawn youll see a green mist coming from it as its created 
---
weird. it doesn't rain inside for my camp near Helvitia
---
I feel like some of the screenshots we have seen are just from the dev room on PC. 
---
Everyone who’s a lower level wouldn’t
---
It would show the world is recovering. It would feel less devoid of life and the new NPS could have quests like BIV.
---
 Possibly a week before they add humans they could release a quest where you have to clear out a predetermined area,  and then next week the humans have moved into that spot. That way se feel like we're actually impacting the world, rather than just killing enemies.
---
There have been 5 confirmed mask drops, the only two not found is the jester and the skull
---
No , I've only successfully tamed twice. Wasteland whisperer is actually really useful though, you can pacify scorchbeasts (and other creatures) and just walk away from them while they aren't attacking you.
---
Fallout NV and gun runner arsenal weapons would be awesome
---
10 times today.  Nothing yet.  Sadface
---
Oh well. No one needs it that bad anyways. Events are supposed to be fun, the player is the one who chooses to enjoy it or not. 
---
Boston was closer to a nuke impact than West Virginia.

I wish it would rain and become foggy more often too. The rain in Fallout 4 and this game looks great. I'd have it raining 24/7 if I could.
---
If you don't want to brew, don't. It's that easy. The parade could move a little faster, but it's normally over in like 15 minutes so it's not like it's super slow. 
---
As for base building, I'd LOVE to make bases with more clutter, but the size itself isn't an issue for me.  It's what things like the Bramin cost 10% of budget. Give me a damned pet, Bethesda, and don't make it 10% of my budget. At least I have a fish lol. 
---
I use a level 45 Lead pipe during the event. There is something satisfying about beating up the rad toads to death with it. 
---
Have you heard of this thing called facebook? Cause NO ONE over there has got one either. 😉
---
And who was referring to only this sub.
---
youtubers will complain it's too lighthearted and childish, and then the internet won't stop talking about "Fortnite 76" for the next month so no thanks.
---
I loved the firecrackers before, personally. They were cute. 
---
 I have to do the Sons event again. I always have fun with it.
---
YES!!

T is a FIAT (Fix It Again Tomorrow)

Right? How hard is it to put a couple letters in the title of your threads. 
---
The best armor for pvp is assassins sentinel and assassins cavalier. But it is even better if you get a set of that with Ap refresh too.
---
Lol agree on the same boat still got a few days 
---
Maybe the few people that have them are bethesda developers..
---
And stealth field turns you temporarily invisible when you get hit by a melee attack
---
Negative. Done this over and over and makes no difference 
---
supersledge all the way.
---
without the bloodied build its about the only big hitter in there.  
---
buzzblade is my fav for bloodied.   
---
Honestly completely agree with this, but I think you can have one in your camp and in the train station. 
---
The fact of the matter is, if I got one, I would tell no one, because I would be hounded with Trade Requests, Direct Messages, etc.
---
You all act like players OWE you screen shots.  You act like they OWE you proof.  Players don't owe you jack.  You don't like it, suffer. You all shouting "PROOF, OR YOU'RE A CHEATER" are the worst aspects of this player base.  Grow up. 
---
Three times for me, ever. Averaged about once every *hundred* hours, and lasted about a minute each. Also gave pitiful amounts of radiation. They might as well have not bothered even putting them in the game.
---
Side question: that perk that gives regeneration during storms and rad storms, does it work inside nuke zones? Pretty crappy otherwise
---
Suspended guy here OP has know idea what he's talking about. I've personally followed most of the posts related to this subject. the 900 hour guy still suspended and my self currently still suspended. i believe personally that i was wrongfully suspended however after reading Mountains of threads related ignorance can get you suspended. for that i am guilty as charged. Now this topic is toxic so if your reading this for information be prepared to not get very far. i personally have moved on. Bethesda doesn't need my money and turns out i didn't need a online fallout that restricted my hoarding 
---
Can you show me on the doll where the bad men touched you?
---
Ifff you say so
---
Hey I’m on spring break but on Tuesday I’ll pick it up and for a late fee I’ll pay more. I believe I’m 58
---
booo! i was super hopeful when i saw the setup at the Top of the World, this really lets the wind out of my sails!  
---
well, thanks for the info, anyway...hopefully future updates will allow us to cater to our ultraviolent aesthetic. see you in WV, Waster!
---
The source of your remarkably salty attitude is grossly misplaced.
---
We're not asking *Players* for proof, we're asking ***BETHESDA*** for proof.
---
And since communication isn't something they do well, we have to resort to players providing it. Not to justify themselves, but to justify this game.
---
It doesn't rain indoors in Fallout 4.
---
I think its hilarious that instead of understanding the "exceedingly rare" comment of Bethesda's description of the event, everyone is quick to assume either a) the event is broken! b) there's a conspiracy afoot!
---
Not sure if you guys are just new to events that involve rng, but this happens. Play any money-sucking Gacha game, or any mmo -- absurd drop rates exist, doesn't mean the game is broken.
---
OP here. I was suspended and then unbanned and never rebanned. You said I have no ideo what I'm talking about and then never provided any counter points. Maybe at least add something of value to the conversation next time.
---
Or when I forgot  an important detail on getting highground on a Deathclaw turned and received a rock to the face...
---
Can you prove otherwise?
---
Hmm, I'll have to have a closer look. 
---
I was with you up until the "even in a hazmat suit" park. Those suits massively curtail _any_ radiation, giving about 0.1 rads even in a nuke zone
---
Cool man enjoy. Send me a message because I will forget lol. 
---
If they did this it would take away from the rarity, but something is better than nothing. If only 3 mask exist for a million players it's not rare it's fucking stupid. I have never bought an atom and probably never will and for the most part getting atoms has been easy. I did read a post about a daily that was "level up three time" to get some atoms that is fucking insane another example that Bethesda is Wasted on NukaShine. I did picked up the two masks they had on the atomic shop. I read that people are buying atoms in support of Bethesda doing a good job on updates and new content and I think I would too, but when they do shit...
---
Level 112 And I tell you
---
3 Times.
---
Got each time a Screenshot.
---
3 Times..
---
 Thats once every 40 lvls...
---
Thats around once every 100 hours super rouhly.
---
Wanna see them *waaaay more often* !
---
is the pirate mask the one that looks like a [skull wearing a hood](https://i.imgur.com/s2p9nyW.jpg)? because yes, that's the one :D
---
*" In this day and age, where Console controllers have a dedicated Screen capture button, and computers have a shortcut key, how can that be possible?"*
---
You asked for screen shots of the players drops.  Don't tell me you don't want proof from players.
---
Right, because NOTHING else in this game is/has/or will be broken. Nothing ever.
---
Say, how's that Shielded Casual Underarmor lining? You get it yet? No? Must be RNG. It's not possible that the list of rewards it's on is completely broken and that it's unobtainable. No sir.
---
Not gonna happen some type of issue with the engine from what I've read. 
---
Nope, I haven't gotten any to 100%. But you can't either lol I never said it was guaranteed to give you a mask. You get a chance, from what im told(from someone with a rare mask). 
---
Nope.  Can you tell me when you plan to grow up?
---
Then level up.
---
And why wouldn’t they want a chance at more exp, and a reward that would be useful for them for much longer than a lvl 30 reward.
---
I full on agree with you. I don't understand why, but every subreddit I frequent in regards to any video game is full of people feeling entitled to things or demanding changes.
---
Strangely enough, I'm on 300+ and have seen three. So, rad storms occur once every hundred hours then...
---
Still happening today
---
I didn't even know there were radiation storms in the game!
---
That’s what we’re all hearing, but I’ve ran this with a crew and none have dropped when we’ve executed it perfectly.
---
I am going to refer you to the add promo....
---
Playing devil advocate..lets pretend they are dropping and the 5 ppl who claim to have got one, the circled promo is only for them. 😉
---
Nuke the area if you really want better stuff 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Maybe not weekly but daily. The game would crash a lot less if it resets daily
---

Good job buddy you gain hate from these players
---
I just use a Spotify Playlist that has all of the songs and the ones that the NV mod added 
---
Its just that your unreasonable attitude indicates some past trauma...
---
Yeah, and thats perfectly fine.  Also would justify my not showing anyone that I got one.  I have seen the way this sub acts when someone has something others want.  No thank you.
---
Wow, that’s really interesting, it’s at the very end of the video for those like me with attention span issues, a potectron just walking around is one minute normal, then next promoted to legendary with green glow and everything.  
---
I don’t think mods can “level up” in this game at all, and there didn’t seem to be anything around for it to kill anyways.  I’m going to go with a theory that it was a server-lag issue, that one had rolled to be legendary, but the server update didn’t make it to you yet.  Something to that effect.  
---
Man I would be so down but of course I’m on spring break
---
The desks of the Military Wing in the Bunker. If you dont see them, dont pick up anything and server hop, has a high spawn rate
---
It very obviously is a bug. There would be no point in having every other piece of clothing not be equipped as armor apart from this set of rags.
---
It’s a yearly event so yeah do it BGS. Add more to it each year. 
---
What, because I see 40 posts on this sub a day about how the masks are Dev Room/Photoshop/ill gotten gains?  
---
OK buddy.  have a great day.
---
Fair enough, although I could have sworn they mentioned camp decor through normal items elsewhere. No matter.
---
all the nuked flora is much better and easier to see now I love it.  The mutated fern for violet is my favorite, I can see it and it’s pretty now! 
---
Yup, that's a bug, the badge has a wrong material / texture applied to it than intended.
---
Sick!!! 
---
I’ve only played like 50 hours and I’ve definitely been caught in several rad storms, always at a bad time too
---
i dont care about the event its boring... once again bethesda is NOT  listening... apparently  they dont have anybody with any amount of imagination... seriously,  i asked for some real content to the game, and  thats what i got? i want area 51 action( and yes I'm dating myself), wolfensteins hidden rooms, a real conspiracy within the story, and a FREAKIN   WOW factor...  i want to walk into a building and spend an hour just trying to  clear the monsters and schorched.. (without getting killed) if i get killed it'll  take longer.. and i want to jump at something that WASN'T  in the building last time i came in.. is it really that hard...  you say the event is for everybody... i say stop with the events and add some ACTUAL content for EVERYBODY...    L@@K @ Fallout 4 it has actual content... 76 may have better graphics and online coolness BUT FALLOUT4  is still a better game.   MAKE 76 better than 4  PLEASE... 
---
Or at the very least add the two songs they removed in one of the first patches.

---
I never said I wanted better stuff. I only pointed out why a low level would like a high level sloth to spawn.
---
Was half expecting to see a mega sloth with the name fluffy
---
I thought they said it was going to happen every year?
---
“YouTubers will complain” is true regardless of game status...
---
Fasnacht was fun the first few time and the common masks are cool, but with the promise of these "rare" mask and seeing it's impossible or "supposedly" almost impossible to get one to get one is what make it feel like a let down.
---
Side note: the small animal intestines are needed.
---
They don't spawn in nuke zones.
---
I’m only at 130, and I’m finding it hard, I can’t imagine at 336!
---
I’ve become a big fan of using weightless gear and using the chameleon mutation with my snipers and rifles for the permanent invisible sneaking whilst moving, plus the basic rifle perks make it nice and easy to get stealth damage
---
İ still think they got it from dev room
---
Ghouls shit out legendaries, even when they are not 'legendary'.
---
However, last night i was fighting level 68 scorched in a nuke zone and they were dropping level 10 pipe rifles lol.
---
Incoming "Must be a cheater" replies...
---
I did the event and a suicider took out a bot, I got a toothy man mask
---
This sounds a lot better 
---
Pretty sure it’ll happen yearly. 
---
Oh, his name is Jack.

Very nice.

I remember in Fallout 1 &amp; 2, I was a pornstar and a slaver, I even sold my companion to the cultists,

Nowadays, 22 years later, Fallout 76 is a sim simulator with a smurf face as a rare drop
---
Add me Im new Dr.Chem-Cocktail I could use some cool plans for my future clinic
---
They deleted all of the bobbles and high quantity items, none of those were causing the instability. It’s the items that they didn’t delete and can’t easily find that also happen to be the same item type that causes server instability, legendary weapons and armor. 
---
Like I keep telling you, a hoarder will never hold a candle to a duper in regards to causing server instability. And that’s pretty obvious to anyone with a brain, considering one spends hours picking stuff up, and the other gathers 100x what the other gathers in the same amount of time simply by creating it from thin air. The fact that you’re even arguing this is ridiculous.
---
With a name like that he's got a channel somewhere, you could probably find out if he got it legit. 
---
I think people are giving up on this even. My last fasnacht felt there was a small group and and it felt void of excitement, bad music and another mask I have multiples of.
---
PC sources cant be trusted because we KNOW the Dev room was accessed on there. 
---
I wish they lasted a bit longer, too. The two I saw came and went so damn fast I didn't really get a chance to enjoy them.
---
I hope I will cross paths with a nice player that wants to share.  Nothing yet at level 7.  
---
I’ve used this event to practice stealth with a crossbow, when I do it right I can just drop the suiciders quietly before anyone else even sees them.  
---
I also have been trying a MIRV fatman at the end for the wolves, since mini nukes are free in the event, so far I kill myself at a 2:3 ratio, but when it works, it’s very cool. 
---
Are u an ostrich? Cause you really need to pull ur head out of the sand. 🤷‍♀️
---
Point 1 this topic is toxic and you will not get anywhere untill bethesda responds. point 2 OP doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to 900 hour guy. bonus point OP is oddly salty for a unsuspended player
---
I’d love to see a controller system at your camp. You place your items in it and they’ll appear at the train stations.
---
Or both locations. Risk reward thing. 
---
Okay thank you, very helpful :) 
---
How is point 1 toxic? 
---
You can make your own pectin with apples.  Crab apples work great.

You’re way to underleveled. Unless you want to just hide behind everyone but you won’t really get anything out of that 
---
I want to hack the musician.

you can also switch between auto run x and run w it will regen
---
He traded to get it.  Looked up his account and he claims he traded to get it with someone
---
I just want to experience it. Not to worried about the loot side of things. 
---
Just went to his reddit," I obtained the Old Man Winter mask today, but by trading with a stranger. (We had a language barrier so sadly I have no organic confirmation to contribute to finding a successful method on now to obtain these for yourselves.) You can check the post I created and pinned to my page to see the photomode picture I took while wearing it."
---
You have to craft it
---
The only legendary SB that exist in the game is the queen . The regular ones can still drop prime receives though, they're worth killing once you can do it without expending too many resources.
---
Love 'em, especially from my elevated cliffside camp east of Atlas Observatory, looking south/southeast. They settle in the valley, and make for some great photomode pics while myself and others are on my deck, playing a tune. I've had at least two while in that location the past 6-8 weeks or so, but would love more!

On ps4 so no dev room
---
Pectin = animal fat, so it could be a drop from animals. Deer, squirrels, Yao Guai etc.
---
I noticed that, too. 
---
Ah. That would make sense. 
---
Armor workbench I guess?
---
The Flatwoods Monster “ambushed” me at WhiteSprings.
---
I was quite surprised since I never heard of him appearing in that area.
---
) got some nice pics with him 
---
I don't understand this debate... I have all the masks I know that there is ... get them every 3-4 runs... I'm only lv 17 I think, tho that's a long story for another thread lol
---
Right? A fridge and canning would be awesome. Food crafting doesn't really need "balanced". It wouldn't make anyone overpowered, and having to farm ingredients and craft it already makes it as balanced as it would need to be. I personally love this idea.
---
I’d be pretty sure the change since the update is the massive amount of server hopping for the event  right? I’m a person that would never do it before, and I find myself doing it, and as soon as I find a new event it fills up immediately.  There are even times when people load in and I can feel the game pause, like when it spawns in new MOBs and it stuffers for a second, but much much longer. 
---
I bet it’ll be better come Monday.  
---
Sweet. Thanks for the help!
---
I know I'm not posting about Fallout stuff... so... scorched beast. I just want to pass this along... Don't worry about getting too carried away with documentation - the biggest help to us (after the fire) were pictures of our stuff. That helped us remember what we had, and verfied to the insurance company we had it. Pictures are really the key. Before our fire I thought the insurance company would cut a check for the amount we were insured for... it doesn't work that way. We had to list everything we owned line by line, how much it cost, and what year purchased. They go through each thing and depreciate it based on the year purchased. We lost everything so we had to do that for every item we owned on a spreadsheet. Fortunately my wife had gone through the house and photographed everything when the fire turned our direction. The photos were our go-to when we were listing everything. Receipts are good, but photos are easy.
---
I recently  got the Alien Blaster, it was fun doing a run through with that. Someone else had a flair gun, with of course looked like fireworks, was great fun. 
---
Do events for caps, recipes, and weapon and armor plans
---
A good event for weapon plans is at Eastern Penitentiary it’s called like Patrol or something 
---
I told Bethesda to not listen to you and to do what I asked. 
---
That's literally the place he mentions in the OP.
---
They could even add a 2nd rank if Good Boy so that all canned foods give more benefit. There are so many ways this could easily fit into the game.
---
That is a theory we’ve been entertaining, but the problems started before the Quantum armor was discovered. 
---
I've had my PS4 since they came out. This was news to me a week ago. 
---
I like the weekly updates. 
---
OP said scorched, not scorchbeast 
---
it already does tho.
---
This is actually a really good idea. Nice job on the photo too. 
---
You can if you pick good with salt lol. Adding canning would negate the need for that perk, so Beth could alter it to give increased benefit instead.
---
I always picked "Kurt Loader" :D
---
If you're spec'd for sneaky sniper you'll find using anything other than a rifle difficult. Once you level up more and can add more versatility to your perk load out you'll have more options. 
---
You can do lots of things to level up. Crafting  and cooking food helps with cap. Sleep and play instruments help with do gains  check stat menu in your pipboy to be sure they are active. Pick up and scrap weapons and armor to learn plans. 
---
can't turn that off on xbox.
---
That is definitely not the only reason. We use vats because it literally teleports us to the enemy which is especially good against gun using enemies
---
Think about the roadmap though. Perhaps we will begin to see more this summer
---
I really doubt they'll spend their budget licensing music that has no impact whether a player will decide to play fallout 76 or keep playing fallout 76.
---
The fact your defensive is questionable. Also you can ignore everything else in this game, but 10’s of 100’s of trade and buy requests are too much. 
---
So is making a single post with you showing that mask does exist and clearly stating your not selling or trading again is too much. 
---
I might be dyslexic but no one here said anything about getting your “mask” they just want clear evidence that they can get the mask for their collection. 
---
Also don’t respond as I wouldn’t want you to repeat your self or blows ram stick coming up with a reason as to defend yourself again. 
---
I’m really looking forward to having traffic through my camp, I’ve even built a riverside complex with a diner, bar, workshop, lab, accommodation etc.
---
That said, your suggestion is a really good idea, it should definitely be an option for people not wanting camps full of other players.
---
Have a well deserved upvote.
---
Google biometric safes if you do.
---
I’m talking about being able to experience things. You would need to hide like 3 rooms back at your lvl. You wouldn’t see anything 
---
I think maybe they already intend on adding it. You mentioned the jars and lids and it got me thinking, those things are literally everywhere. It would make sense.
---
I get what you’re saying. But I think the way around this would be if they allowed vending machines to be built at workshops instead. 
---
I'm a trader and I'm involved in a lot of PvP so I've played with and against pretty much every god teir armor set and you're still squishy af even running full 3* assassin's set. It just protects you from players who don't understand PvP any way. Anyone with some know how is gonna kill you regardless of armor.
---
I think that the reason that radstorms rarely ever happen is that they are essentially a free nuke zone. Had to deal with lvl 68 scorched, glowing radtoads/honeybeasts/wolves when a radstorm passed through during the fasnacht event the other day.
---
literally the first image that popped up when I googled canning bench.
---
Sorry to rain on your parade, but it did rain inside the building at the nuclear waste disposal site a few hours ago for me.
---
Super mutants carry caps.
---
It still rains inside tents tho 
---
Can you imagine how bad we must all smell? None of us bathe or wash our clothes.
---
The developers didn't really promise the rare masks. I do agree it should be a little bit more available, like maybe a redeem system. Nothing is truly guaranteed. 
---
Maybe the devs are just being trixy liars. 
---
Not likely as the SB reproduce at a really fast rate. 
---
Would be cool to nuke all the fissure sites and force the SB back to prime and have a massive man vs bat fight leading to a bigger quest. 
---
Doesn’t appear to. 
---
I mean as an ending of this phase in the game.
---
I have binned the radio all together for this. Spotify fo4 playlist all the way!
---
Canned food just shouldn't spoil and should give no SPECIAL buffs. Boom balanced.
---
I had one, in about 90 hours. 
---
Rain occlusion was in Fallout 4 and it's in Fallout 76. It's just inconsistent. I believe most of the Camp rooves will activate the space under it to occludes rain.
---
I enjoy the game... usually. The game is still fairly buggy but has come a long way since launch. At launch, I'd have told all my friends to avoid the game like the plague. I'd recommend it now, though not at full price. It's greatly improved, and the improvement is notable. But sometimes for everything they fix they break something completely random.
---
&gt;Enemies not taking damage (only every 2nd / 3rd hit)
---
This is the worst for me. The enemies are in fact taking damage but seem to insta-heal the majority of the damage. It doesn't happen all the time but it's incredibly annoying when it has.
---
&gt; Enemy AI is god awful  
---
Yeah, this is a Bethesda-wide problem. In most core Bethesda games a wide variety of enemies can be defeated simply by walking backwards. You avoid almost all damage but can hit them easily, and it happens in Elder Scrolls and Fallout both. The AI likes to either charge directly at you or slowly strafe from a distance. That's about it. Occasionally they'll take cover, but Bethesda and AI don't go hand in hand.
---
Ah. That’s what I thought the main quest would have us do.  Can still nuke other areas but nuking a fissure would start a whole new chain of quests. 
---
The perk would still be useful when farming the ingredients to make the canned items
---
I turn the radio on until I've heard Sixteen Tons and Shenandoah then it's off again.
---
Actually, I leave it on until Mr Sandman comes on, then I hurriedly turn it off. Cannot stand that song! 
---
yeah hence the reason why fallout 76 still sucks...
---
Haha that’s funny
---
Have you ever considered presenting your views in such a negative way?
---
More so there’s nothing in your post about what they need to fix. It’s all insults and childishness.
---
Fix what exactly? 
---
Absolutely with you on this ridiculously swift decay of cooked food and fruits and vegetables. They need to triple or quadruple nerf the decay rate. Since I have to walk everywhere I see just how swiftly they go bad. 
---
Undoubtedly, as with most things it appears they did, the goal was to limit and constrain. I understand not wanting server lag to increase because everyone’s cooking up stockpiles of food, but it almost seems as if they increased decay lately or another accidental rollback on update. 
---
A really crude and mechanical fridge would be hype. Doesn’t need to hold a ton of food like 5-8 pounds would be good. 
---
It's been done numerous times with numerous bots, everyone is still getting the regular masks. 
---
I have over 200 salt, pepper, spices, and packaged food lol. They aren't rare if you know where to look :P
---
Don't they still have the licensing from all the songs from the other fallout? 
---
Lol. Hilarious. 
---
Even if it was true that you needed just a single robot to survive to get the rare mask into the pool, having even a single robot die dramatically lowers the chance to get a mask at all, so the chances are just so tiny.  
---
Also I understand them screwing up and making the odds incorrect, that’s a reasonable mistake, purposefully making a team event where the goal is for everyone to protect things actually be best when to just bearly protect those things seems stupid and way more complicated then it’s worth.  
---
This is someone forgetting to move a decimal point, I always forget that!  
---
Most are addicts looking for something to sell quick to get high. I taught GED's to a lot of felons that could be very reasonable once sobered up. But when addicted they are unpredictable. So trying to make sense of it as a reasonable person is tough.
---
Sure can! 
---
IRL cooked food begins to spoil at room temperature after 2 hours. By 4 hours bacteria has taken root and it can't be served in any establishment that answers to a health department. So the food spoilage is actually hyper realistic.
---
A new bigger, badder baddie would be really cool. 
---
Maybe this is an insane nitpick but....
---
How would they make that work in game? We're all the humans that are left (as far as we know) besides other vaults. So we have some radio station that is apparently on auto-pilot spinning tunes. No DJ or other human intervention. So how would it suddenly find new music to fit the rotation? 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love some new music. I can only here Bongo Bongo Bongo so many times before I have to turn on Spotify. 
---
Patch 7 is how the game should have released, this should have been 2 weeks after the official release date, the levels of everyone would make sense and it would be a great event to keep everyone together after coming out of the vault 
---
Theyre changing pacifist to prevent you from being killed in pacifist mode, but that won't apply to workshops.  Taking a workshop is a pvp invitation.  
---
Thanks for replying. I can trade you 250 caps if you want for it. My gamertag is GrowlingTiger44. When would you be available? 
---
Just make it like dog food. 10% hunger and that's it. No SPECIAL bonuses at all. Boom balanced 
---
Right 🤩🤩🤩
---
Someone hasn’t done Belly of the Beast quest yet 😉
---
Go through all your saved armor and craft it to ultra-light. I also use 2 mule characters, about to make a 3rd, lol I've got a legendary hoarding problem.
---
Do you really think a slave/rape themed game would go over well now? 
---
After reading others comments, i want to ask; on wich system are you?
---
I'm on Xbox One X and it always had rain inside, and still has it.
---
Then add a 2nd rank of the Good Boy perk to increase the benefit of all canned items so there's a way to make it more useful at the cost of a card slot. Still no SPECIAL buffs though.
---
175%-20% lone wander-30% dodgy-20-80% based on level difference. then u add up the dmg resist of ironclad, assassins, sentinal, and any other resistence from armor mods.... Again, its about math and actually learning how dmg and dmg resist works in the game. learning how perks interact with one another. the only players who can take us out are other full-optimal pvp builds or vats crit snipers who take us by surprise. 
---
its not hard to figure out. there's an old saying, "there is always someone better" he got you fair and square within the bounds of how the game works, and that makes u salty, understandable. but there are ppl out there that are just better at pvp than you. and there are ppl better than us. bitch and moan all you want, but we dont break the ToS, so we are safe. get raided
---
Next update you won't be all PvP damage is turned off unless you shoot back. He can shoot everything he had at you and it won't do anything unless you shoot back
---
well if you think about it 76's map is way bigger than 4's map.. now look at the amount of content in that little bitty map compared to 76... if your not pvp then you're bored.. and i hate to play pvp only games, which with little to no content is exactly what 76 is...
---
I have marine armour with the ultra light mods on. 
---
Maxed rifleman perks with tank killer. Tenderizer and tormentor. And nearly all the sneak perks. 
---
Not worried about anyone getting in my face as I’m dead either way. 
---
Run instigating lever and laser rifle. With a 10mm pistol as backup 
---
There’s a weapon workbench in the little shack right by where the robots get in line for the parade.
---
What is cream used for anyway?
---
This has always been a thing in online games. The worst thing about it is not the end result, it’s the exploitation of the people who are behind the characters doing the farming under almost sweat shop working conditions/terms of employment, depending on which country they’re running the business.

I don't have one.  I have done the event 10 times.  Got the mask I wanted (The Owl), and have stopped doing the event.
---
But, lets just say hypothetically, I did manage to get the mask.  How long after I post a screenshot of the rewards reveal on the screen do you think it would take for someone wanting a higher level of proof?  Someone demanding I show them a video capture of me doing the event?  This sub (despite rule 9) is full of witch hunting.  People accuse others of cheating, duping, griefing daily. Yes, there are griefers.  Yes, duping has been a problem.  I can't speak for cheating, as I play on console, and don't have to deal with that. 
---
I play the game because I enjoy the game.  I think Bethesda has done an acceptable job. Sure, there are improvements needed, but I don't come on here screaming about how I am owed anything. I don't come on here screaming about how I am quitting and it is all Bethesdas fault for not giving me EXACTLY what I want in the game, and to hell what other players might want in the game.
---
Despite your request for me not to respond, I shall do so anyway.  I, as a player, don't owe you squat.  If I get one, It will sit in my stash, never to see the light of day. 
---
OneX
---
I'm with ya on resource extractors. I gave up on those as I can bring in a much bigger haul of lead and junk just running around the world for a little while. I'm fine with turrets however... if they could just fix the issue where the turrets sit around like space cadets while hostile mobs wreck my camp. Put em high and out of reach and upgrade to the heavy ones when you can. I only lose em to scorched and super mutants now but they usually shred em apart when they do eventually detect them, lol.
---
The scorched just have so much of it lol.
---
Exactly, the current rules will make the pvp a poor men’s brawl over nothing lol. Until they change the rules and let the system rewards the players not letting players rob each other, I’ll stay away from it. 
---
Hm I don't remember it raining inside very often in 4 unless it was a building with holes in the ceiling or something
---
Server hop to the event location northeast of fort prickett.  Far north east of toxic valley, east of the crashed space station.   Easiest spot.  
---
If you aren't going to use your camp, might as well help other people
---
/uLadyDevann 
---
I’m using a lvl 15 bone club lol
---
If you can become a general, I can probably walk you through sometime. Not necessarily today, but when we're both free.
---
Lol, sorry, that's not it then. It might be more related to the way the roof was made.
---
I think in PA they just swing it. I know animations for a lot of melee weapons change in PA.
---
Yeeeahhh, no, you're a liar
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Out if curiosity, are you using the pump action or combat shotgun?
---
Rofl. My bad
---
I’d like to see the Crashed Space Station be utilized in a future DLC. Maybe investigate how it went down or learn about its past. Its such a cool location.
---
Just did the entire event by myself (seriously not one other person showed up). I think only 1 or 2 robots survived. Got a soldier mask and a flag pole plan. Already have both.
---
I imagine a lot of pre-war recipes containing post-war ingredients is actually just our characters making logical substitutions...
---
Totally. Too bad i couldn't find his camp. I would have levelled it.
---
Maybe during the nuclear winter update? It does sound intriguing.
---
Grab all the junk near a vendor and sell it to it
---
It only works if you're less than 10 pounds overencumbered. 
---
That’s a good data point, didn’t the nuka one get published pretty quick after the update though? 
---
I really want your project to work though, so I’m going to keep hoping it’s the server hopping and it’ll settle down significantly soon.
---
On this I can agree... there is so much scope for additional locations and lore to be added to the existing map. I'm hopeful that we'll get new stories that will rejuvenate existing areas; new holotapes and notes to find 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
---
Do you enjoy downvoted? 
---
There is a reason it's called a grind and the peeps who legitimately get one that's awesome, but yah one or two people in the whole game and getting only one each of the same old man winter mask? Where are the other four? Someone would have gotten one by now? I think the time to get one of these rare masks ran out before it started.
---
That owl head is popular.
---
Thats the joke.
---
I could probably do Thursday. And I’ll just take 200. 250s alittle high
---
When the other vaults open up, give us a bot or ghoul DJ to take the reins of GNR. Also just give Rose more to do on her station. Could even have a Daily quest (like the Biv booze runs) to find new music holotapes. Doesn't need to be too complex. 
---
I wonder this for all the stuff that requires Flux to build. Like... how were all those decontamination chambers and PA mods made before the Great War?
---
It's the best looking one of the commons imo. And it matches my dress! 
---
For caps get Hard Bargain rank 3 and the Pharma Farma perk to search containers for extra chems. I always end up with TONS of excess chems and sell them off. Hit every faction vendor that you can (responders, raiders, Whitesprings, WS Bunker, Watoga station and plaza, Harpers Ferry) for 200 caps each per day. Once you find a good source to farm stuff and make a vendor run every day you'll be swimming in caps, lol. You can make like 1400 caps/day just from those vendors. It's all about finding your hustle.  
---
I also like to bulk and sell stuff like copper. It's freakin' everywhere. Lol. Idk if the weight to caps ratio is any good (or makes sense) but it's something I've always loved bulking and selling as I rarely use it and it's just all over the place. Purified water is a good hustle too sometimes if you've got surplus or industrial purifiers at your camp or workshop.
---
put it this way .. nuke.. scorched beast queen, go to an event. nuke the resort... go to an event.. bord now nuke the queen... really bored now switch servers.. asuming i haven't already due to glitch.. start over and repeat all day.. boring.  i get better action out of that stupid call of duty game an it has less content... where as fallout up to this point has been the leader in my genre of games... im not trying to dis on them i just want a real game, with real content (that i cant beat in an hr) and pvp/pve in the mix.. 
---
No, there's far too much opportunity for variety to ignore it like that. Plus, SPECIAL bonuses and other effects (DMG resist, etc) are an integral part of the cooking mechanic. Combine that with the fact that canning food (done properly) doesn't make the food any less nutritious. Canning should be less effective than fresh if only because fresh tastes better, but canning should still /be/ effective.
---
OPs idea to make dog food by using spoiled meat had merit but if go about it differently so spoiled meat is still spoiled. Say canning meat takes 5 of that meat, which retains much of it's original properties. Dog food could then be made from mix n match 5 of any meat so that it still won't spoil but it's not great either. That keeps it fairly sensible IMO and still allows for variety (especially for people like me who RP cooking).
---
You can also get all the wood you need from the side of the radtoad building. HUGE wood pile there.
---
I said they wouldn’t...
---
I'm sure there are a lot of public domain songs they could use if they dig. 
---
U selling or buying
---
Oh no not the merchant club!  :-D
---
Don't worry about it.  Some people are pests.  
---
That event is freakin' great!! First time I did it I got Handmade Rifle plans. It's super easy to complete, too.
---
I’m buying yikes maybe I didn’t make that to clear lol my bad 😂
---
I've only seen two legit screenshots of people getting the rare masks. With the amount of people doing the event that is too rare for a silly mask. It should deff be higher drop. Maybe if it was a god tier gun that can solo the SBQ I can see only a couple ppl having it. But this is masks. It has to be a coding error. 
---
Well, don't drop loot in public spaces. Good luck not looking like idiots with the report lol 
---
I’m buying*
---
i am not a high enough level for these but the way you put you top is [XB1] H. (what ever your selling) W. (whatever you need.)  [Just to let you know for futre help]
---
To add on to this; I was told to go back to you can't every two hours to replenish the well-rested perk.
---
Also, there is cranberry relish and/or cobbler that can increase XP gained(I don't know for sure which is better or if they stack)
---
Ah, the rare and majestic Kamikaze Yao Guai...
---
I’m not really too worried, Bethesda can see the messages if they suspend me and Xbox won’t suspend unless they have definitive proof.
---
And did you report them with the new report feature?
---
Yeah, just a bit odd they would try to intimidate me into giving items back lmao
---
I saw one on my way between Overseer's Camp and Flatwoods VERY early on, it was so eerie. I was wearing my vault suit and hat still. Glad I got the screenshot, because yeah since then I've seen maybe one. 
---
Ghoul is 10 feet away from me, I‘m in Vats, press attack and voila, I‘m right in front of him within a blink of an eye.
---
will try tonight thanks
---
Nope. No news from Beth in regards to the other masks or any changes in the event.
---
Copy
---
You are correct sir, I’ve spent so much of my time outside the cause inside the suit I never knew.  I suppose there is some psychology behind that, but I don’t have time for it now, another robot parade is starting! 
---
I have two melee characters and I can activate VATS within 5 feet. Doing it makes me sprint at a higher speed to the target and strike. I’m not sure how y’all are experiencing this teleportation, but I never teleport and have never had anyone teleport to me. What you’re describing doesn’t seem to be universal 
---
There is also an armor bench in the church.
---
But sadly no stash.
---
They can't just take past fallout songs &amp; put them into new/different games.  That's kind of the point of licensing.
---
Same here, i kind of want rid of it though...
---
Jim...I may look you up very soon!  Thanks for the offer.  xXJohnnyMechXx
---
Enemies had no problem attacking settlements in 4, why all these new restrictions? 
---
Even if you did pick it up, the report would do nothing. The game has a trading system for this reason.
---
I've got a level 50 1* instigating pole hook with the puncturing mod I'd sell for 850 caps or so. 
---
Maybe if you do the event once or twice, but if you're farming, I find it's easy to use up 100% of the wood in the area.
---
As of the game will survive that long
---
Wait, they did what?!
---
Now that you mention it, I know those songs because I heard them when I started playing, but it feels like ages since. Was it because of a bug or some copyright bullshit?
---
Please do! I’ll be on again in 3 hours or so. 
---
Don't forget the pink armour and Princess Castle bed. 
---
Right! and of these two screen shots it was pointed out they are both wearing the same rare outfits and have other rare items. It has been said they got the two old man winter masks from the dev room.
---
Lol i hope the whole clan gets banned
---
Report abuse at its finest
---
Same, from Cleveland. Just checked here to see if anyone had the same issue :(
---
That's where I CAMP, across the pond from the shack by where the stream feeds it. Since the update made it possible to use more turrets I zone it to the sound of machine guns and a rocket launcher fairly routinely.
---
The dusky and glowing tear through barricades pretty fast and, sometimes they 3-shot me before I can finish them off.
---
...pretty well set for springs and acid now, though.
---
Maybe they did:). It would be a welcome surprise. I'm not really sure why people would downvote me. I'm not trying to be a hater. Just saying that displaying things at our CAMPS might start out as specific things on specific mounting shelves like weapons and bobbleheads. I do t think they are ready for us to just start putting dozens of random items on tables in our camps like people want. :). 
---
Ah well. That's the 76 community for you. Just like all the babies upset over masks. 
---
Yeah it's kind of funny that most players end up with a "floating" building because the only way to get an established house to fit anywhere is to put it on a single foundation with a staircase. 
---
The limitations are ridiculous. We're in a wasteland, I should be able to build wherever/however I want. I understand not being able to build in certain areas, but even in towns and stuff people should be able to take over houses. The fact that we all have these weird square clunky buildings is so weird. I should be able to build a weird nest on a monorail track if that's what I want. 
---
AND LET US HAVE A FAST TRAVEL MAT GODDAMMIT.
---
Military wing of enclave, sugar grove, and a few other places if those aren't dropping for me
---
I can do 65 a piece. 
---
r/market76 is extremely active in regards to trades and selling.
---
even if he was right and you did take them there is nothing bannable there. he fucked up and dropped it. baggy is up for grabs.
---
people can be stupid.
---
Ok with me can u add me pappododo
---
Always in game. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised honestly. I think Bethesda fucked up. Which is cool if they would like fix it. I dunno I'm more excited about the future content. 
---
I really want Run Around Sue by Dion.
---
Lets all set up in close quarters and form a village
---
I don't want another crafting station. I'd like the Tinker's bench to be able to do that, though. 
---
This ~~bug~~ feature was ~~fixed~~ removed in the 11/12/18 patch therefore either you imagined it or upon entering the cavern you travelled back in time :P
---

---
Bethesda wants to make money not spend money on listening to make their community happy (Like GTA)
---
Okay.
---
Somewhere in here? What is the event called?
---
https://imgur.com/a/xTStZxO
---
Yeah, I’m not sure why he tried to intimidate me into giving back items I didn’t have or had for a month. But messages are there for those that want proof.
---
I got the deep pocketed arms/legs plans from a chest in the toxic valley, I had been farming the grafton monster for them and happened to find them in a random chest. 
---
Nobody’s gonna make you mutations for free. They are way to expensive to make. But I think maybe 4000 each and you have yourself a deal
---
I don't mean anything negative but, How?
---
The share function was all over the release of the ps4?
---
For real. Between parades I've been running thru the forests piling up on wood to bring with me for the next one, lol.
---
So still no rare ones?! Hello? The event is almost over there is not even enough time to get all the rares ones almost now. 
---
I can super duper calmly and confidently say you are lying if you have encountered no bugs after leaving the menu screen :)
---
Yeah, nice one...
---
It's going to take about that long to get the music out of my head 
---
You have to be very lucky to get them. I've only seen one of the rare masks (PS4). I think only a handful of people will get them this year, and I'm
---
super happy for them! That's gonna be a really cool status symbol/bargaining item!
---
Clever girl...
---
Me, too. 
---
Thanks man!
---
Vendors, events, out in the world. 
---
Very nice! I love camp building, too. 
---
Too much buffout....
---
They've always been there.
---
This has actually been gone over before and tried, it doesn't work. It's neat to think about though.
---
In the title line? Or description?
---
Originally I was going to make a snarky comment because this comes up every couple of weeks but then I realized that a lot of people are still finding these little details in the game... and that’s awesome. These tiny Easter eggs do go to show the detail Bethesda put into their game. 
---
Now I’m wondering what I’m going to find that I’ve never seen after 300+ hours and that makes me happy
---
Can’t see comment and don’t know why. 
---
I guess I should have spent more time swimming.
---
I could be wrong, but is the 200 cap per vendor not tailored to the individual player and reset every 20 hours or so? My nearest vendor is Sunnytop Station, and every 20 hours it resets to 200 caps. I usually do a vendor run around the same time most days between Raider, Responder and Whitesprings vendors and cash in on 600 caps.
---
Incidently what do you use your caps for? I mostly buy plans and occasionally fast travel, but there will come a point I suspect when all I can buy are consumables? 
---
Slightly north of there.  A small clearing behind a rock and stump.  Beyond some dumpsters.  
---
It’s got no name.  It’s a random occurance.  Can be the lemonade vendor.  Or could be things like corpses that have special costume recipes.  Or enemies like death claws or wendigos.  
---
Thanks, its what I love best about 76
---
Yeah it's SO quiet. :(
---
That would be title. Because it is easy to see everything you are selling/wanting. (Unless it is a lot of stuff)
---
Does anyone know where i can find wolf spawns been looking for months with no luck
---
I saw him near the overseer camp (on xbox) :
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/lechattricote/screenshot/11734129
---
Want more directions?
---
There was a dozen low level players like levels 1-6 all at the train station. I watched after about a 2+ dozen plus other players (all levels including a level 262) met them over 20 minutes or so then moved to another location.
---
What new report feature? All I've seen is regular reporting... also not sure how to report a dozen players since I would have no idea how or what they bought. 
---
In the transaction I placed for caps for example you send them you GT from xBox and you get a message to meet...  
---
Right between the Sunday Brothers Cabin and Harper's Ferry. I have had luck with the bridge area between there and Big B's Rest stop as well.
---
Honestly me, too. And I love seeing other people's camps. We all build so differently, it's great to see an outside idea and adapt it sometimes, too. 
---
Dude, I didn't even notice.
---
But I definitely remember both of those songs being in the game, I had no idea they removed them.
---
Not impossible for them to have mutated some grain or wheat pre war. In AMS in Watoga, there's a terminal that goes over them using Ultracite pre war to test its affects on animals, hence the random Yao Guai bodies that are inside there
---
I think it's hilarious they lost their items, and I'm almost always with a group. Go somewhere quiet to do your drops, dimwits, doing it at the queen is like dropping a bag a Fasnacht. People will be diving for it there. I don't know what they think they're reporting. 
---
Maybe it occurs more often in the low level areas? I've been playing with my girlfriend since launch, and she is very slow so we never ventured too far away from flatwoods, i've seen plenty of rad storms in this area.
---
Bring on Wednesday.  Same thing happened to me last night, poor idiot machine gunned a robot right next to himself, with an explosive .50, hence committing explosion-induced suicide.  I took his bag and switched servers.
---
Unlucky
---
this is one reason I lost interest in the game. it took me so long to a really find a creature I could tame and to have them finally come back to camp only to be hostile towards team mates or no ever defend camp or wind up randomly dead or just disappear without a sign. it's an incredibly cool system that needs to be fixed. like many other aspects of this game I want to be fixed so badly.
---
For real. In bed ok fine, no. But sitting down? wtf not. 
---
Thanks folks!
---
My gaming time is limited, these outages drive me crazy!
---
good bot
---
Generally when you license something, the terms in the license agreement define how you can use it. 
---
Obviously I'm not privy to the details. But the way it would normally work is you have to buy a license for each work you want to include the song in. So even though they'd used it in past games, Bethesda probably had to shell out again to use Butcher Pete. Given that it is an old song that doesn't bring much royalties these days, they might have gotten the use rights pretty cheap. But it is unlikely Warner (who owns the song) gave them the rights to use in as many games as they wanted. 
---
It's all about balance, my friend.  Some subreddits are mostly positive,  some are mostly negative.   I rad a bunch of em and get a wider perspective.  No side in any argument is 100% right all the time. 
---
Hmmm i cant change that now  but will in the future, thanks. I don't sell much, but figured someone would want this LMG. 
---
Well after being out for 4 months now they fixed and changed many things
---
Be on in just a sec
---
The game was slaughter by game journalists by good reason. Any game publisher like Bethesda kaliber should never get away releasing a game unfinished. If they had postponed a year or so it could have gotten 9/10 reviews. It was a business decision.
---
Nope, not for a lack of trying 
---
Well if you do decide to start selling again you know where to go.
---
Sry i had to stop playing tonight
---
Certainly reads like a scam. Not sure what the trick is though. Hopefully not a new trading exploit.
---
Sry if i wasted ur time
---
I actually had a thought yesterday that it would be really cool if they had a NPC robot vendor that set up camp at the outskirts of these week long events, and they have a bench, cooking station and stash so you can dump gear either before or after without having to lug everything back (currently to Sutton).
---
That’s what I was afraid of if I began a trade. Part of the reason why I didn’t accept a trade from either of them.
---
There is no comment
---
Not I. I haven't seen a rare mak either.  Probably done it 70+times
---
GTA Oniine did add new music  as part of few new Online updates,  and those stations extend into single player too.
---
I'm willing to bet GTA:O and Rockstar have more resources to be able  to license new tracks and new stations for modern music though, especially since the last major music addition also involved using the  likeness of real-life DJ's.
---
I have a feeling licensing music over 45 years old might be cheaper  than licensing new stuff, but who knows.
---
Yes something needs to be done. Scraping ammo would be a welcome change for me 
---
I just remember it from a Bavarian/Czech area of Texas they would sell wierd poochie balls (not the proper spelling). I didn't care for them, but they were better than King cakes in my opinion. 
---
Is it just me or does Biv sound like John C. Reilly?
---
It’s ridiculous! I was at a GameStop, getting something for my kid and the cashier kept bashing Fallout76 to a customer who was handing over the display case as he waited to pay for his copy of 76. I stepped in after some false information when the cashier admitted he didn’t play it and that’s what he heard on YouTube. That told me everything I needed to know about the public perspective on this game 
---
That would be awesoooommmeee. 
---
How do u get the BoS symbol on ur nametag? 
---
I guess not😂
---
That'd be rad. 
---
Or shortly after anyways. I did hate the rad storms in Fo4 as they seemed to occur entirely too often and the only escape was instancing into an area inside. It would be cool if you could at least go into your camp to avoid it, but as you’re constantly running around in Fo76 and it’s online, I feel like it could get pretty annoying. 
---
Making them occur around a nuke launch makes sense and would be more manageable though. I think I’ve only seen one since I started playing and was actually surprised they made it into the game. 
---
Select flat from the main fo76 page on reddit 
---
Why? Do you not need it anymore? Confused. 
---
What's your IGN and time zone?
---
I'm EST... IGN is LillyVee .. add me if you'd like 
---
Do you have a point?
---
Happy to help
---
FML, it's a game! There is nothing in this game that you can't replenish... lose a little loot, go and find some more. Jeeze, some people really need to get out more 😂 
---
40% of them would be made up of different slurs 
---
OMG, I'm going to give this a try!
---
SAFE the email messages! Report them to Bethesda and xBox support for threatening to mass report you. 
---
Even if they did accidentally drop it like they said what about all the 1,000+ people who drop bags all the time?   
---
I wouldn't worry about it at all...
---
Bidets are an abomination!
---
I have one for 250
---
FO4 has rain occlusion. I even have it in FO4VR. You must have the setting disabled either through your in-game settings or INI, or it is disabled for performance reasons based on your GPU.
---
I have no idea how hard programming is but maybe a filter? 
---
CBBE is coming!
---
The caps loss on death already keep me from ever wanting to PvP. By doubling it Bethesda has ensured I will never play survival mode.
---
Any chance I can do 200 so I at least have some caps for fast travelling after? 😂
---
About 115 runs, no, have not seen anyone wearing one either.
---
That seems to be a Bug, the game doesnt differeciate between legendary and normal when it comes to Mods. 
---
This reminded me of the first time I found a Yao Guai by the battle cemetery when I accidentally locked onto it in VATS while I was trying to clear out a super mutant horde
---
Yeah its better that way anyway, cuz when you dont want it you can just scrap it and craft it again later :P
---
I didnt disable it, you can't do that on console. 
---
I just had a run in at Cranberry bog with a Wendigo that was camouflaged, had a glowing red head and was making the assaultron powering up sound.
---
Oh lmao yea sure man 200, my psn is BirdJP19, join in on me. Also kill me, im trying to get rid of a 10 cap bounty on me its annoying haha
---
It burns, just like a shower should.
---
Some dude dropped 75 filtered waters and like 700 gun powders and I was level 3-4. Haha. I’m level 7 now, nothing anymore :(
---
SMH Maybe they should make all the loot drop as soon as we walk out of the vault. Then people and just logout and never play again. 
---
Could be mobs. 
---
I've noticed that the brahmin is usually the first thing they go for. 
---
Like, it's on the left. I dunno. My brain just doesn't see that button. 
---
You seem rather obsessed with duping.  
---
I was collecting them for quite a while but I don't know if we'll ever be able to display them. :(
---
**Bruce Banner** lol David Banner is the rapper from Mississippi 😂
---
Holy shit that is amazing!

#LifeGoals

Haha I get that, I hit it pretty early on thinking it was the select button from the PlayStation of old 🙃
---
I Would 
---
I have like 75 blank holotapes waiting for something like this...heh.
---
Dang.  I should've jumped around to servers when I was just starting out.  Played 8 hours straight my first time trying to figure out wth was going on with the game.  So many things to get used to/figure out.  :/
---
Yeah that would be super helpful. 
---
*Bruce Banner* 😂 David Banner is the rapper from Mississippi 😜
---
Then why do you want to spend so much time for 10 atoms?
---
Yeah, your 2star legendary, max level, supported by what I’m assuming is some degree of legendary gear, on a character at max perk loadout, and should I assume also a quoted damage number at the peak of its damage effectiveness (it is nocturnal after all, that only lasts a few in-game hours)? Yup, you’re like the dad at a sporting event telling another dad “yeah my kid could totally kick your kid’s ass”, when one kid is about to go to college and the other is in middle school. 
---
I’m level 37, 2/3stars in Brawler, no other damage perks like bloody mess, zero legendaries whatsoever, not running adrenal reaction, no chems, just basic gear.
---
I’ll take this back to the start of my involvement. Have you tried a “nocturnal, swing speed” level 50 power fist? Because if you haven’t, you aren’t making a good comparison. 
---
They've said a lot of things are working correctly, and they've been wrong before.  And just because they say something is working just because they *intended* it to work a certain way, doesn't mean it actually works, there are lots of ways to mess up code to get bad results.
---
If it's a matter of 'it works, you just haven't broken the code yet', well then I'm OK with not knowing, but if that's the case, I wish they'd come out and say it that way.
---
I've not encountered this message before, but I quite often get 'no item selected'. Try exiting the build menu, leave for a few seconds before trying again, works for me. 
---
Mayor for a day is SUPER helpful at the end though, so stick with it. 
---
People would go to r/rareinsults to find creative ways around said filter.
---
Oh, and I ended up surviving it by entering the elevator, closing the door and hiding LOL. It took a while but some other players ended up killing the SBs for me. xD
---
Will I just meant the guy you directly purchased them from
---
But if you open the map click on the player there is now a "report player" option
---
34 was a pound heavier than the 42 and the bolt being on the left side, while rare, certainly isnt unheard of and is only used because game designers think it looks good when there's lots of moving shit on screen. Now I'm off to fight giant retro sci fi bugs with my 100% historically accurate guns mods guys, because that's where I draw the fuckin line.
---
I have both at the moment. I tend to use my pump shotgun more though.
---
Adventure mode is coming next week...
---
Honestly, I find vats to be more advantageous in melee vs melee than vs ranged. Ranged dudes normally turn and run when you get too close, or simply jump backwards. I think they're more afraid of hitting themselves with their own explosive bullets than of the big bad dclaw. Melee fighters hold their ground, but they move quickly back and forth, which is a massive bitch. I spent more of last night killing people with a picket sign than with my bloodied claw. My dad needs a job. People need to know. Awareness is key. 
---
Does Biv give daily quests? I just completed that quest yesterday.
---
Well then it's because you're on console. Rain occlusion should definitely be an toggleable setting unless you just don't get any of the same updates as PC. Did you even check your settings for a "Rain Occlusion" option?
---
You do know Grog axe can’t be overrepaired, right? That’s a decent chunk of damage right there. Not trying to disputed anything else you’re saying though. 
---
Finally completing the main quest line and it stands out to me that the story strongly hints that we should be nuking the fissure sites, I assumed the smaller fissures would have various legendary mini boss scorched building up to nuking prime.
---
In reality they are some of the worst locations to hit and nothing special happens other than the fissure closing. Feels like something left unfinished.
---
The main issue was people like myself who preordered the game for 80 bucks and it was a complete shit show.
---
I'm having fun. 
---
If you take worshops you basically are forced into pvp. It’s honestly a really stupid feature.
---
I think any destruction of your camp by a player will make them Wanted, so it probably is mobs. 
---
I got mine from uranium fever. If you are on PC, I can craft it for you. Just provide flux.
---
Not at all... just pointing out the hypocrisy of it all and nothing being done about it to stop it. If people are still duping and on top of it selling in a market for actual cash? It's just as wrong that's all.
---
That'd be great as long as you don't have to be online at certain times for raids lol. 
---
I just nabbed a Dragon from a vendor with faster moving while aiming and it helps when I hit over the 1500 lbs mark.
---
Once you have a bloodied weapon you will enjoy I get my helth down so that my lever gun does 500 plus per shot.
---
I have unyielding bos armor as I've got a mix build,mele for close up lever for range and harpoon for the big guys plus I never run out of ammo for it.
---
Don't know if he spawns in consistent areas, but I've seen him several times in WS golf course and in the middle of the Mire. Hope this helps.
---
I like the rng but at the same time i dont like burning out just to get one of the masks that i probably wont like
---
I edited my comment I meant how they added new music and radio
---
By taking a workshop you click yes to a popup that says other players can initiate PvP against you. These players did as follows: one of then started contesting your workshop, opening the PvP between his team and your team (consisting of 1 person if you were alone). The other one used the facr PvP is now opened to shoot you.
---
According to my observations indeed this has increased. There is no counter to that besides not taking workshops. Hope this clarified the "hows". Take care.
---
Most of the time there are enough people to do each thing 100 times over so I've never had a hard time finding stuff. 
---
Did you recently finish the BoS questline?
---
Did you by chance just finish the Brotherhood of Steel quests?   Full suit of Ultracite PA is the last reward. 
---
CST, and IGN is LegateVesanus
---
I would be pissed! I love my t60 it doesn’t take shit to repair it. 
---
He was called David Banner in the TV show.... And Bob Banner a couple times by Stan Lee in the '60s .
---
You know what yes I did and I have 2 power armor chassis’s that’s probably what happened lol I might be dumb.
---
Gotcha! I didn't know they added that thank you!   
---
On a side not there was about a dozen of them but all low level so I'm sure creating a new character isn't that much trouble and I'm sure they have  few if it's an operation doing it.   
---
From a legal aspect of it, I'm not sure how they get away with it... Bethesda should buy the items or tag them to see where it's all coming from. 
---
I cannot wait for 0 slap damage.
---
Parade is stupid anyways lol did that stupid parade like 30 times and got the same bullshit masks lol wooooo
---
Well, they had Part 2 in Fallout 4...
---
T60 is the shit haha looks good too.
---
Copper has medium weight to caps ratio. 1 weight per bulk, sells for something like 18 caps. Well worth picking up if you need the sale goods, but fiberglass, acid, adhesive, fiberglass, fiber optics and gold are better wealth stores.
---
I don't see why the storms in 76 can't be coming from the glowing sea though? what's stopping the wind from blowing southeast towards west Virginia?
---
You want to trade? That doesn’t seem like a good trade if so
---
Unfortunately no Fallout game has ever added new licensed radio songs as DLC. Vera Keyes and Red Eye were original songs.
---
Even the Mysterious broadcast consisted of songs already heard in the main game in the casinos.
---
I noticed that the other night. 
---
How do you turn it on? Can it be done in FO4VR?
---
Having it rain inside my camps was in some ways the most relentless depiction of how shitty your life was - everything is so rusted and ruined that you can't even shelter from the rain. I would have a happier game if my structures could keep out the rain :)
---
Plus all the BOS paints are T60 only.  
---
Ppl are bored and some us us cant wait any more for survival mode!!! Buts its def not me griefing
---
You want any thing else with the sledge?
---
\*Survival mode
---
This is amazing, great work!
---
I've read that dataminers think the limb ultralight plans are in the toxic valley as well and I'm planning on combing through all the known plan spots tonight to see if I find any combat armor plans.
---
...it’s always been a visible drain using the jet pack
---
Jet Pack has always drained them fast.  You can see the meter move when using them. 
---
Are you sure you didn’t just recently unequip a Power User perk?
---
You have letters and Signs plan and if so how much? 
---
That's a thing already. You can learn the recipes from downed scorchbeasts. The SBQ drops one 100% of the time.
---
Makes sense...but after they kill me and took the workshop can they still kill me? 
---
or.....maybe they never took the workshop and just kept contesting so they can continue to kill me...
---
I think I answered my own question lol but yeah this makes sense. Annoying as hell but at least it should be better once the new survival mode opens up. 
---
Oh, okay. No problem. If you need it later, just add me. I sent the request. I'm on a lot at night. If not, it's cool. 
---
Well at least on PlayStation your characters are linked to you PSN so if one of then gets reported and banned for cheating I would imagine it would be their PSN or Xbox live ID(if it works the same way) that gets banned.
---
Though they could still be using multiple psns or XBox ids
---
NVM, just realized what you meant.
---
2 times during beta and once about a week ago at my camp.  I thought the rad storm was a nicr change of pace and hung out on my patio and enjoyed the irradiated air.
---
I’ll never for forget my level 20 mega sloth I had for over a month that was torn apart by glowing mongrels... ;~;
---
**adventure mode
---
I think it depends on the map region. Higher level region legendary have more stars. 
---
makes sense. I couldn't understand why they could keep killing me but I'm thinking they would contest the workshop and never actually take it so that they could keep killing me. 
---
Sure looks like a scam to me. Run by a 12 year old lol. 
---
They were both in FO3, I wouldn't mind seeing them again.
---
It still does sometimes, most of the time actually.
---
On xBox you can create a new profile with a new email and play the game on that same xbox. 
---
Same lol
---
I think I mostly agree. Only things that stands out to me about 4 while I’m playing 76 is raiders putting up more of a fight than scorched, being able to build robots, and name gear. But maybe someday. And in the meantime I can always jump in 4 to scratch those itches if it bothers me enough.
---
It doesn't even bother me that ppl are bored and that they killed me. It's that they keep killing me and that gets annoying. 
---
Also, yeah, unyielding doesn’t show as an “effect”. But check your specials.
---
Also, can they take all my caps when they kill me? I thought it was just my junk. 
---
Maybe if they fix the meta. 
---
Yeah i figured as much. You can do the same on PlayStation. Hard to stop RMT in games nowadays i guess :\
---
The trouble with radstorms is that you have one near Vault-76 and a very low level players receives it... Its going to be a killer that they can't avoid.
---
Apparently 3 or 4 people have.
---
Maybe I have started exploring out again a little more lately but I'm also seem to be getting it doing the ghoul run in non nuked whitesprings
---
In fallout 76 workshops are part of pvp activities. It's one way BGS decided to get pvp going between players. All you have to do is not take a workshop and everything is fine. How else would workshops work if you couldn't take/defend them from other players? Server hop to find an empty one? Or first to claim gets it and keeps it as long as they are on that server? I agree it's poorly thought out and explained
---
A dark tower reference 
---
I think there is people out there that haven’t played this game while sprinting in a long time.  I saw a post once a guy saying he’s been overencumbered since beta. And never has done otherwise. Just to hoard stuff they don’t need.  
---
I usually just take the junk I want (steel and lead) and then trash the rest.  Usually hoarders will have enough materials to make ammo for a couple scorch beasts runs 
---
My fourth and fifth items disappearing happened today. Gonna miss this game but I'll be waiting for this to be fixed 
---
ah interesting. Streaming is more important to me than playing 76 so I will look for another work around or just disable the GPU when I am not using it. Thank you. I will see about opening a support ticket.
---
Never knew the MG42 was considered an odd weapon :/
---
Well it was used in LA Noire with other murder-themed songs.
---
Imdb currently has about 15 formal entries for Al Dexter’s composition, “Pistol Packin’ Mama”.
---
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223282/
---
Of course the composition and the recordings are two completely separate things in terms of copyright, but most of them are the Andrews Sisters and Bing Crosby version.
---
1962 bro, the first issue written, it was Bruce. Stan lee actually fkd up and misquote his name while writing the scripts for the comics... and everyone reading had a field day with it. So they renamed him. And then it changed again and then Eventually back to Bruce lol 
---
Yea I agree a couple of bad actions can really alienate people quickly which of course is not ideal. Either way thanks for the feedback man, always value hearing additional perspectives. 
---
My apology was sincere, but I also see the point you're making. Either way thanks again for taking the time to respond to me and help me improve. 
---
Yea it pisses me off all I wanted to do was see if they wanted to trade lol
---
Or maybe make it so you at least get one rare mask after 40 or 50 events tries.
---
 I'm all for having rare items but not to the point where they are almost non existent.
---
Yes, you lose caps equal to your level
---
Well u get 3 cards so it's just like non-auto build so basically 9 perk increases..I'm not really a fan of automatics tho I think I wasted a few points with automatic pistols
---
Yup! I agree. I find it hard to believe that Bethesda couldn't or can't figure out who is selling all this stuff and change the ID code associated with the items or something. 
---
Lets say they farm junk like any other character... well hundreds of them doing just that to sell takes away from everyone else doing it on the same server... that's just a general comment, I know a lot worse overall happens
---
It's on by default in the launcher for Fallout 4. No idea about VR.
---
That whole situation seems suspicious. They may have been trying to exploit the trade system, but i think they were up to other nefarious exploits. Id report them. 
---
I can confirm I pulled a syringer from a 3\* last night
---
Put your pen inside concrete bases and  walls, far less likely your Brahmin or tamed pets will die. 
---
I wish more weapons in fo76 had a niche
---
 The automaric railway rifle for example; super durable, high damage, insane fire rate. But also insane recoil and ammo weight. I think the underlying issue is that not all weapons are as unique as the railway rifle. The revolver types for example. It'd be beat if the single action had a fan the hammer in place of a power attack. Perhaps the wester revolver could have accuracy the goes all the way to zero in time and enchanced headshot damage. The pipe revolver could have other cylinder options for smaller or larger ammo types in exchange for magazine size.
---
Coming in like 2 weeks. Check out the Bethesda roadmap.
---
Very true and with how fast Bethesda moves to fix these kinds of things, I doubt we will see an end to it.
---
A song has two parts, composition (sheet music) and the recording.
---
While their are public domain song compositions, US copyright law does not currently have public domain recordings. Most of Fallout’s songs also happen to fall in a loophole where all pre-1972 recordings are under a blanket copyright until 2067.
---
This also happens to be 10 years before the bombs fall in Fallout.
---
And a chem bench in the church, but no stash ofc
---
I bet u never even played it
---
This game is my jam
---
I would like the winter mask
---
 I tried. The difference is all I was trying to point out. The DPS on the knives can be insane and its sustainable endlessly.
---
 Have fun with your fist, I have played with almost everything and I like knives.
---
Yeah, similar feelings were felt when I ranked one up to 3 for the perk card rank up challenge and only had 2 special points in that tree so couldn't use it.
---
I could just give you a full set for free I am a power armor hoarder 
---
Vending Machines are being added not too far off in the future.
---
You can put items in them and after setting a price, other players that come across your camp can interact with the vending machines and buy whatever you put in them. 
---
GTA unfortunately removed songs from the radio too, years after the game was released.
---
Fallout hasn’t done that yet, though there were two songs from the BETA that didn’t make it to the final game.
---
A bloodied build with unyielding plus vats perks you can shoot automatic weapons for a good while and the the crits+headshots you will be to OP then with perception up to like 25+ you wont really miss I can link my build if you want to see it.
---
Good to know. 
---
This is what I mean.
---
Higher levels will go to every vendor and sell all their stuff.
---
Then when a low level goes in they can't sell anything at all.
---
I’m really enjoying it. Especially now with the new events. It’s bringing players together a lot more. Only thing for me is since the last patch it’s been glitchier than ever unfortunately 
---
I meant to choose a one handed melee and I chose a two handed one..ughhhhh
---
me too! I just kept giving them the confused and trade emote but they just continued to shoot me. 
---
I heard there may be either xo1 or t60 plans now, can't remember
---
Sounded like dome 7
---
Haha me too. Just want that jester mask lol
---
Sorry it's a 2* instigating pole hook. With +50% limb damage. 
---
It’s probably AI enemies doing this. 
---
I have to wonder... if they ban players or suspended players for picking up or having duplicated items would they ban or suspend them if they bought these items?   
---
Wonder if that's coming?
---
Yeah , I'm stuck on Wasted on Tick Blood Tequila because it requires a crimson flux to make. Most I've managed to gather is 3 raw :/
---
The whole map is unbelievably okay for a nuclear armageddon happened just decades earlier.
---
It is one of the things I like the least about the game.
---
The lack of radstorms might be the core of the problem
---
My cap pockets are pretty light all the time, if you feel so kind...
---
Didnt mean to rhyme... Dammit.
---
I have this sneaking suspicion that it's going to cost an arm and a leg to trade in your legendaries.
---
 I would wager it's not as simple as giving him your legendary weapon and he re rolls the stats for you.
---
 My guess is it's going to cost some kind of stable flux and/or caps.
---
Yeap.
---
I wish they had wanderer still and also rocket man. 
---
Yeah, I would not be surprised, honestly. Open up with... hmm, weapon mounts and bobble heads, maybe a functional magazine rack or something. Work their way up. They seem very inclined to tread carefully when it comes to server load.
---
Ya, that’s the point of my reply.  A mocking, sarcastic, but truthful, repetition of Bethesda’s response to the event criticism.  
---
Hmm idk I haven't heard of anyone who received duped items and didn't dupe them themselves getting banned yet so, we will have to see🤔
---
That's not how it works. Each player gets 200 caps per vendor faction.
---
It rains in my house :(
---
No. That should have been fixed in fallout 4 when skyrim Modders fixed no snow under roofs.
---
I can't appreciate such a small change thah took them 7 years to do. 
---
Lol. BURN HIM BURN HIM
---
I have one. Furious with blocking reflection.
---
I have one but it’s 35 and has zealot don’t think it would be what your looking for but thought I’d say incase 
---
Well this shower does even more than just cleaning, it makes you completely sterile 2.
---
I saw a level 22 kill one of my cows with a  laser pistol 
---
I wish they would add songs as holo tapes and scatter them around the World as Loot and we could upload them at any relay tower. And may be affected for all players permanently
---
I've seen some 2 and 3\* as low as level 14 but yeah the higher your level the higher the challenge the game wants to give you so you're more likely to run into 2\* and 3\* legendaries. That being said in my own personal experience I'm more likely to come across a full 3\* glowing legendary than I am a 2\*. Single or unstarred legendaries much more common. I'll get 1-5 1\*'s and maybe 1 3\* a night just doing my thing not counting reliable legendary spawns like the Fasnacht Sloth.
---
As of day 6 of Fasnacht: I have the Giant, Owl, Soldier, Toothy Man, Witch, and Beret. I've been playing this everyday since fasnacht parade arrived and haven't seen anyone with a rare mask and have been server hopping constantly for the event as well.
---
I’ve seen a level 22 kill my cow with a laser pistol and go unwanted
---
Just tested it. Works fine! 
---
Hey I'm on for like an hour.... I will be later tonight also in case u miss me
---
I know they did it and it did nothing. But it would be a nice chance to take the game into a new era with another monster.
---
My base is surrounded by missile turrets so I doubt it’s that
---
You are correct on several points I just re read OPs statement and I think I was misguided when I read it the first time. I think I glossed over the first time and put it in the place of all the whinners that come on here daily. I apologize to the OP. 
---
 No thats not an option. 
---
I’m 98% sure that (at least with combat armor) it uses ballistic fiber at level 30 and above, it’s likely that that’s similar with other kinds of armor
---
System and amount of caps willing to spend? 
---
BONE HAMMER TIME
---
What does deep pocket do? I found raider leg plans for it yesterday
---
I like this. But they would have to make each vending machine have separate inventories. Otherwise people would start duping again.
---
Yep not what I am looking for... (looking for a upgrade, not same level, lesser quality)
---
Saving all my atoms for Halloween.
---
Is there anything in the names that state something is combat armor versus other forms? The names vary across the board on them.
---
Xbox, 600 caps
---
Cool just wondering what would be better as far as crit damage or exploding lol
---
Plus add the old rifle.
---
Thanks. what is your ign?
---
45 during the BoS quest, wasn't that difficult just took a while
---
And it didn't trigger the Wanted thing? That suuuucks. :(
---
Levers max level is 45 btw :) 
---
It's you! The ~~hero~~madman of ~~Kavatch~~ Watoga!
---
It used to be great. After the update its just meh. Rarely see a legendary there.
---
Never seen this, and I've modded a lot of lever rifles. Pics?
---
What is you talking about? Bobbleheads and magazines were deleted of course, all those stacked weapons and armors got deleted and their numbers were reduced to 1. Some of the dupers were smart decided to unstack them by dropping and picking them up but 99% of them were deleted. Where'd you get the idea bethesda didn't delete weapons? Stop assuming. 
---
We're you wearing PA indoors? When I did after launch I could still see rain in my PA visor indoors. I'll have to test it out next time it rains.
---
cool, haven't seen any in long time, so had no idea.
---
No combat armor is just the somewhat light green armor, other armors have their own names completely but I only use combat armor so i don’t know if the others use ballistic fiber
---
I was looking at my specials and didn't see any change
---
All armor above level above a certain level requires ballistic fiber to repair. Best thing to do is get the White Knight perk maxed so it requires less. 
---
We should be friends!!!!
---
Several of the key songs aren't available on Spotify though
---
I thought it was only if you were set to pacifist? Or at least that's the way it should be.
---
I bought the Xbox one x bundle with Fo76 and started playing right afterwards, I wasn't a day one person but I love it just the same. I was really nervous it wouldn't be good, and of course there are bugs, and of course griefer's but the community in this game is unlike any other multiplayer game I've played. Plus I love fallout so it already is great :)
---
They had us it the first half, not gonna lie...
---
Hey man I was wondering why you think that? I don't try to come off that way and I would really like to not sound full of myself or anything 
---
Armor repairs used to cost ballistic fiber even before level 30. That was changed in a patch. White Knight and Fix It Good perks cut down the cost, so it's not normally an issue once you get to high levels.
---
The difference between level 35 and 45 is not that much base damage, so if you find a good 35 you like, hold on to it. 
---
How come you feel this way? 
---
Actually as someone who had to make a lot of those enemy spawn points on new settlements I created for fo4 as mods, often they would have problems if you didn't set pathing properly. 
---
There's basic assumed points they recognize, like cliff height differences but the AI would still often end up falling off the cliff if provoked easily. 
---
Exactly what I mean!
---
The drop chance is based on rng so even if it is unlikely, mabey everyone in fallout 76 has been unlucky or the percent is ridiculously low. 
---
+karma 
---
Hey man I'm just wondering why you feel the title was clickbait? I normally try to strike a balance of an appealling title, but also not misleading people. 
---
Occam's Razor, "the simplest solutions are more likely to be correct"
---
Given BGS's history with RNG rates, it's a safe bet they screwed the drop rates on this as well. It's a safe assumption, you're just blowing smoke.
---
I am just looking to see if I can get a level 45 (furious) Lever action rifle..... because it's going to bug me, that I am never gonna be get the max potential out of this thing.
---
He said can't
---
Some of the qualifiers get dropped, but you'll always have the base armor type word in there: Combat, Marine, Leather, Metal, Raider, Trapper, Robot. 
---
As far as I know, all of them need ballistic fiber to repair after level 30.
---
What video are you talking about here? 
---
Adventure mode is what we have now.

I did a auto 10mm pistol slinger up till level 90 , it was a lot of fun and the versatility between swapping between a tse 10mm and a medics 10mm was pretty cool. I used criticals but couldn’t figure out a way to include sneak thay much due to most agility perks being in the auto pistol damage perks  
---
The builders resources are used.
---
Do you have any specifics around this? Like what makes you say this commentary is divisive or ill informed? Or is that just something you feel like overall 
---
😂😂 yes but reread that
---
Adventure mode will soon have 0 damage. 😌
---
That's just it though. He was avoiding full fats crit sniper shots from my teammate. He was taking no rads. He was not taking damage when he was flinched. That is not the build you are describing. That is an exploit, and that is what is shown in the recording, so stop whining and accept that your teammate is a cheater. Deal with it, trash player.
---
Whats rng? 
---
This is a good idea, but you should have stopped at the idea and not tried to imagine all of the specifics. The pre-war preservative idea is pretty bad.
---
I'd like that. I already have 8 fluorescent flux ready. I might not be able to play tonight. But my IGN is the same as here on reddit. Crafting it takes fluorescent flux yes? I have some road leathers ready, but I think I might want to get a harness as well.
---
I would seriously love to hear me some Sing, Sing, Sing by Benny Goodman and Louis Prima.

Ahh I see u found it and edited your post. 😏
---
That is the reason I don't make outdoor camps.... I hope they come up with fix... 
---
I think it's cute, and i like doing it for the plans and masks but they could do with mixing up the enemies a bit, depends on what you consider fun
---
Hey sorry to bother but do you know if it’s still possible to get a TSE handmade from a drop?
---
I hope they fix it too, I love the tents, makes feel like a proper camp :)
---
Oh yeah. More childish stuff is what we need in the fallout universe. Lets turn it into a complete joke.  There is already the pumpkin house btw.
---
This is my problem with gamers of today. It's not enough that they are angry at the companies. No, they have to attack the developers personally and wish them ill (usually getting fired). Also, it's not enough for them to dislike a game - they get offended by the mere existence of the game and the fact that some people enjoy playing it. How can a sane person go from "I don't like this game" to "You are an idiot for playing this game I don't like"?
---
Instead of common joy of playing the games us gamers turn on each other simply for having different playstyle, genre preferences and spending habits. Like what the hell?
---
I have a lvl 45 anti-armor. But it would have to be a damn good offer for me to consider selling.
---
Yeah I agree I've gotten bored of the music there is
---
I like my high level character to wear the tattered dress and the giant mask, while my new one is wearing the bathrobe and the toothyman mask
---
I’ll add you
---
(Small Spoiler is you haven’t done the Enclave Quest) Maybe it can relate to the Enclave and try to recover some lost data for MODUS like in the main quest line, having MODUS recover data about what happened to the Enclave’s plans to live on another planet as mentioned in the earlier fallouts.
---
Yeah maybe the first 1 or 2 times. After that nah.
---
I’m grinding it in the hopes that I can sell the extra plans and masks when player vending comes out. 
---
I've got a 3* Trapper's Weightless Right Leg, +1 Endurance, Weapon Weights reduced by 20%, I'd sell for 1500
---
1* Trapper's weightless right arm 250
---
1* Trapper's weightless left arm 250
---
Does that mean the trade off here is the dev team can do less work so we have to have boxy boring camps?
---
One thing i miss is the hustle and bustle of busy cities and settlements, but i love 76 in different ways! 
---
People are going to keep down voting you no matter how much proof people post, showing this is real, because they want to believe it's impossible because they didn't get it.
---
It doesn't
---
I could add a Napalmer (Lvl 50) and Vampire Sledgehammer (Lvl 50)
---
Underappreciated is the right word
---
Pretty sure my own laser turret killed my Brahmin today. Loaded into my camp upon login and heard "Pew pew pew", when I could finally see my brahmin was dead and nothing else was around for the turret to have been shooting.
---
If I were you I'd find some ruibs to build out of. There are a few abandoned houses aroubd you can build in.
---
Well, we tried. I’d be interested in your: the bot wearing that mask has to die for it to drop theory.
---
What a bunch of degenerates -- I think that's me on the far left.
---
Thanks for the offer, I may have to get back to you on that
---
Thanks for the tip mate
---
Ive only found protective /:
---
Yeah right now the Storm Chaser perk is pretty useless. 
---
Check out the market76 sub
---
I would have thought this wouldn't be an issue, as most of the music should be public domain by now. I don't know much about copyright laws, though.
---
Ok, it probably is tho.
---
All down to personal preferences. 
---
I want it for my C.A.M.P.
---
I can shoot down SB with a Bloodied automatic pipe rifle in a single VATS run.. So yeah I break out the automatic build every now and again.
---
Can I have a link, becuase all I can find are videos that are vague as shit and ramble on for 5 minutes before hand 
---
I've got some other level 40 and 50 stuff, too. 
---
what platform ? 
---
You must be getting downvoted because
---
MR SANDMAN IS A GOD DAMN FUCKING LEGEND
---
Well I didn’t know thanks for the info
---
PS4
---
What are the rare ones? I think I just have the normal ones (owl, soldier, witch, toothy, giant, beret). I did get the effigy camp plans and a spare donut recipe though
---
Agreed. I think we all know by now how much he loves to chop that meat 
---
Considering the fact that the person in the picture traded for the mask, they likely *did* obtain it from a cheater even if they didn’t access the dev room themselves. 
---
Plenty of people not building boxy camps, so the lack of creativity of the users isn't on the devs. 
---
As to environmental adjustments, I think that's going to be trickier based off the current layers system that they use. It's why sometimes you can do things like building a platform in a rockface/mountain or you can't. It largely depends on what the material is underneath. 
---
I'm definitely interested in getting as much as I can inside the camp system, building is a huge part of what kept my interest in Fo4, but I also understand that they've had to adjust a lot by making this open world, though I think slowly but surely we're getting things that we've wanted or expected since launch. 
---
It’s dope that the spawn point for fast travel allows for you to access your camp like that.
---
I'd like to see that.
---
I support every single word : and add some new skin to the handmade, the most popular ranged weapon.
---
Thanks !
---
and Ultracite Power Armor Set 
---
Advanced power connector plans
---
The Nazis produced weapons up until the very end of WWII, many factories didn't stop til they were captured. Thus, there were a lot of surplus german weapons after the war. My dad, who was in the canadian army during the 70's, trained w8tj german weapons. Its not implausible, given the lax attitude towards regulation and weapons in fallout, that the general population had access to guns.
---
It’s in a trailer it’s some drawings of a  ufo 
---
If only there was some sort of pattern Bethesda could have noticed, that would have pointed them to the realization that this game was going to be a buggy mess come release.
---
Is the flamer legendary? I've already got great vampire weapons and ultracite armor I don't even use. Lol

Since it is in very close proximity it could be a high level zone the farther you go in, adding in new levels going past the limit (90,100, or even 125) and also being able to find an undetonated nuke in a crater (Megaton) and also finding a half-destroyed Aircraft Carrier infested with tons of mirelurks lurking around, and possibly seeing the entrance of Vault 101, *for on the fateful day of Oct 23 2077 when fire rained from the sky, the giant steel door of Vault 101 slid closed and would have never reopened, it was here you were born, it is here you will die. Because in Vault 101 No one ever enters and no one ever leaves....*
---
I think that time travelling monorail will act as an alien DLC door one day
---
I was teamed up with a random person because he asked for help and he went to my camp and immediately killed my moomoo. 
---
No wanted. Nothing. I left the team and shot him one time and then I became wanted. 
---
So unfair. 
---
I’ve said this repeatedly. We need a mixtape.
---
Mixholotape.
---
We need it.
---
no but that's like over 1000 worth of caps at this point. 
---
They most likely got them from the dev room, either themselves or by trading with someone who entered. 
---
Definitely this is something else to think of for the next event (hope there is another one anyhow) would be more interesting if it was radtoads or a horde of bloatflys attracted at the start because of the smell of the sausage meat or rouge protectrons / suiciders at the middle phase 
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
damn look at that...thanks!
---
Solved: I got really confused. A weapon with a certain mod installed shows that mod in the list. :-/ I do not have the suppressor yet.
---
It is for a sniper/sneak build like me. But I’m taking a liking to it...
---
Patch 5 added the bali3stic fiber requirement to repair all armor lvl **25** and above. 
---
AA lever action is worth around 3k-5k I believe. 
---
Makes damage more visible I suppose.
---
It’s not even positive though it’s just negative crying about haters that’s my point it’s not doing what it set out to do.
---
Go melee with a "All Rise" that's stupid modded. If it survives the first hit, it's a worth opponent of a second.
---
Did that get nerfed? I swear I don't feel nearly as fast as I used to. Still great for reloading though.
---
You literally have to have foundations to do any walls, you have to have stairs to do regular floors. How is that users fault? People have found ways around the limitations, and made some really neat camps, only for the devs to patch those work-arounds out.
---
I think a part of that is many controversies were out of game issues, but people heard negative news around Fallout 76/Bethesda and in their head transcribed that to Fallout 76=bad. Some of the hate was deserved and some of it went overboard (coverage from media/YouTube [me included]), but a good chunk of the hate was around Bethesda's decision making and not necessarily Fallout 76 content. 
---
I also think this is a game with a really strong early game or really just first half. The first 20 hours were my favorite part, but after that the issues start to show a bit more. We also are getting new DLC and much better communication from Bethesda which allows people to be much more hopeful for the game. 
---
Did you grab the Tin Foil hat? Great area to explore.
---
I base this idea off the usual number of people, obviously the event should adjust to the levels of the people doing in, if there 5 level 100+ people, I think the lower leveled people wouldn't notice a lvl 50 sloth, but I appreciate your opinion.
---
ok thank you! have a great weekend
---
Came here to say this. I'm fairly certain it's quite a bit faster than ADS. I rebound my autorun to X to make it easy autorun/walk as necessary.
---
Putting food in a refrigerator, cooler, or ice machine containers (the ones everyone can access) will make them last a lot longer. Me and my friends just build our camps where there is a cooler of sorts and fill them with food, then we just grab them when we log off. Ive had the same mutt chops for about a week now and theyre still at 80% condition.
---
There are enough guns. The problem is, most are crap. Energy (laser, plasma) guns are useless thats why nobody uses them.
---
I think this is the advanced power connectors. You can buy that plan from the vendor in Harper's Ferry.
---
I might redownload to check this out
---
As stated, this is pretty logical, if you're building a wall, it needs something to be built on. But I've found perfectly legal work-arounds for a lot of things that Just require time or effort or using the available pieces as intended like stairs and ramps. 
---
It’s the legendary effect “take 15% less damage while standing still” 
---
I think they should also make it a bit more obvious pets are pets. Specifically just make a tamed creature have a neutral name color for everyone. I had someone kill my pet before and immediately apologize since they didn't realize. 
---
Although with the update I think it might show your player icon when you aim at tamed pets so that may help. 
---
Highest I seen vendors sell weapons is 800, so I don't believe you.
---
Cavalier is the same but sprinting instead of standing 
---
Just curious, why do you really need to complete it?
---
Two words,
---
#**BIG**
---
#**IRON**
---
Because TubeStreamPussySlayer (what's up, everybody, don't forget to leave a like and visit my patreon and buy me a coffee with the link below) says it's a burning trash heap, and besides, they're young and therefor know everything, regardless of the dumb shit they say, and anyone who dosn't agree must be a fucking idiot who needs things explained to them.
---
what about balancing the weapons that exist so there's more than 1-2 standout options per weapon type?
---
Awesome! I love when people incorporate existing structures. 
---
I hope that you can choose the ability to re-roll a certain prefix.
---
Like You have a   Exterminator Explosive -25% VATS Cost  
---
and can re-roll the First Prefix for (Caps,Flux, whatever) So you may get the desired Bloodied, Two-Shot etc.  
---
But maybe it's just pure luck and you get a complete new 3 re-roll. or even an new item. But i hope you have some certain options. That more precious that more expensive of course
---
Vendors selling something is completely different than folks though. Its listed price may only be for 800, but certain legendary effects/combos can easily go for over 25k caps
---
I've noticed it a bit but was surprised that it didn't happen more than once when 7 of my friends and I took every workshop (and held them, might I add) on our server.  One dude kept trying to take out all 8 of us, it didn't work despite him being a higher level and having a fatman.  I don't PVP much but my 2 shot fatman took him down like 10 times before he finally left us alone because he couldn't kill any of us.
---
Last main quest 
---
I hear Ackbar yelling something in the distance. 
---
6k caps for a cosmetic seems a bit much for something useful
---
I actually asked about this back at the Fallout 76 greenbrier event. Granted that was a pretty long time ago now (Oct 2018), but the devs said it wouldn't be a thing any time soon since the existing map was so large. 
---
The BOS jumpsuit goes for 10k
---
Is the reward so good?
---
Okay, I was gonna gloss the whole post over, but the title just made me laugh so hard. It's basically a /r/RimWorld title.
---
LMAO!!! I'd be skeptical too. I'd been saving an Experimental MIRV in my stash and figured I'd try it out. Worked fine. :P
---
White springs 
---
look, that's stretching my price limit 750 caps is the highest I well ever go, anything higher would just be dumb.
---
Whitesprings bunker.
---
What settings are you playing on? 
---
Random rewards for killing the queen or you can buy them from the enclave vendors they cost 19k caps a piece. 
---
That is
---
Unreasonably priced 
---
Add me please I want to play with someone and do events together I don’t have a squad 😪I’m on ps4
---
No idea haven’t done it yet, but would at least like to be able to say don’t them all
---
Its rare, a tse handmade is common and worth around 2k 
---
I think there are many who have been suspended that had excessive amounts of Nuka or ammo that didn't dup but had those items whether they bought them or found them. 
---
One guy said he bought a prime receiver something like for 3,000 caps or so and the guy gave him ultracite ammo to go with it, he got suspended. 
---
Now I'm not saying it's truthful but I can believe it... 
---
I'm just trying to figure out why one is okay to buy literally today NOT through Bethesda but people in game get in trouble. Not sure how this happens and it's not like they are hiding. 
---
Most YouTube videos say Use my special discount code to get 5% off your purchases... so they have to know about this. 
---
id like to see recharger rifles come back, i had a shits and giggles build for it in the past. 
---
id like the leaked vault tech weapon skins to finally drop.
---
and last id like to see a shotgun shell mod for the pipe revolver, some specific revolvers are built to take .45 rounds and .410 shells
---
What console 
---
Watoga station sells the plans too, but it isn't necessary to connect power lines through walls. There is a litte trick to do it with mats, maybe watch one of Jug's videos
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AyA3qa8X24
---
It's 8 damage points difference for that first shot...just so you know what's making you crazy. 
---
Ill sell you some ballistic fiber if you need, hit up all the survey camps in the cranberry bog and pick up anything labeled “military grade”
---
Had mine ther for a while, on the cliffs just past the end of the parade. Had someone walk (literal, hit backspace for slow movement walk) to my home and just kinda settled down. We chilled for almost 20 mins.
---
Positive, I even double checked. And yea. It’s draining very fast still 
---
Why try so hard? I'd stop the second it wasn't fun to run. You only live so long ;)
---
There’s a dead guy wearing a tin foil hat in the same trailer 
---
A what!
---
Also looking for mods...
---
I got it yeah
---
I know I saw that also how do you find the Flatwoods monster
---
Man I'm so jealous of people who live in WV right now. I have always wanted a Fallout game to take place here in Texas and even more so here in Austin. Would be awesome to see my local area Fallout recreated. 
---
Agree to disagree, I guess. If I have to have ground to build a camp, I'm not feeling totally free with my building. If I can't build within certain areas, even areas that have resource nodes, I'm not getting what the arbitrary rules even are. 
---
What ramps? The foundation ones, or are there unlockable ramp plans somewhere? 
---
Do some vendor runs, you can get 5k caps in less than a week and get a good rifle, or don’t. The only person who would sell you a nice legendary lever for that cheap is a duper and if you buy from them you’re hurting the whole economy and game stability. 
---
In the post I said in the future so we might not see anything like this until Late 2019 or 2020
---
I found it during bet and cant remember which one it was (google should) but some scientist was modifying one of the derelict monorails to travel theough time, had it all set up and such. Was somewhere in the bog
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9341358&amp;d=s92se2ss2pe2eu0er2ir2a04l71lt2lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
So thats the basics. I have weight reducing perks, mysterious savior level 3, tenderizer, lone wander, explosive expert and some other stuff. But the stuff on the build are essential. 
---
Besides perks you need full unyielding armor.
---
Serums you need are adrenal reaction, talons and twisted muscles
---
Some items can also boost damage
---
Agreeeeeeeeeeeee.
---
Soundsfucking cool
---
They removed those but left the Beach Boys? This makes no sense. 
---
Just tell them "I don't like you either". They go away quickly.
---
Yeah, it was, pylon V-13 apparently. I got a good kick out of it :) check it out
---
Well I haven't actually seen a Vendor Selling the recipe for a Lever Rifle (been looking for awhile)
---
Ah, I didn't know about that, I haven't been following a lot of the 'behind the scene' stuff since like January. 
---
It might be a case of tunnel vision.
---
From what I understand Bethesda devs and such involved with 76 is pretty small compared to other large online games.
---
They might just not have enough hands to cover everything?
---
Ah dang it I'm on Xbox. But still it's really nice to see people like you doing this for free.
---
That's the real reason nobody was left alive in Appalachia.  Pete came hackin' and a whackin' and now everyone's gone.
---
Oh yea I saw, but just wanted to give you the extra context. I bet a DLC taking us to some Fallout 3 locations would be a big hit and get a lot of players involved, I doubt they'd pass on that 
---
Echo chamber. 
---
Same, but simply server hopping will spawn fresh steins, so that takes the strain off!
---
You know this subreddit has turned into a desperate circle-jerk when comments actually mentioning the complete shit-storm of a release gets down-voted... :P
---
No, this game is definitely not underrated. A release plagued with a completely broken product and marketing lies for the deluxe edition (that was fun) from a AAA company who should be doing better is not underrated, it's sort of the natural consequence of completely dropping the ball on something. 
---
Good luck finding your AA Lever Action for 750 caps then... 😂
---
Can confirm, got protective and shielded from Uranium, took forever 
---
No 100% if you just want a higher level lever action it's pretty easy to get a hold of. Just the legendary effects bump up the price A LOT!
---
Do uranium fever everytime it pops up and you'll eventually get shielded. 
---
Yeah. The vendor caps belong to you. It doesn't matter how much I buy. 
---
Thank you
---
Commonwealth was target of a cobalt bomb though. Appalachia didnt get hit directly (as far as i know).
---
Why did they remove them?
---
I just saw your username and forgive me if I’m wrong but, are you the actual JuiceHead? The YouTuber?
---
They appear to.  I have received five of them so far.  
---
Initiate (pre patch)
---
Knight
---
Knight CPT
---
Knight SGT
---
Officer
---
Seems like they are going on order.  But I cannot day for certain.  I have not received duplicates since the patch.  Pre patch I received almost half a dozen Initiate paints.  
---
I'd help you out, but I'm o. PS4. Go buy the plan in Grafton, and craft a bunch of level 25 short lever rifles and scrap them to learn the mods. Don't forget super duper. 
---
I like having things others cant bc it was hard to get whether its time specific or hard boss/raid grinding enemy 
---
What plans?
---
In the files of the game you can find some stuff for a bow and arrow and Chinese assault rifle. I think the bow and arrow might be added in with the pioneer scouts questline, not too sure about the Chinese assault rifle though. You can find terminal entries about the CAR and Chinese stealth suit in Mama Dolce's which has me hopeful it is planned DLC 
---
I just want higher level lever action 
---
lol nice
---
Even including FB, Twitter, YouTube etc....
---
Not all gamers are part of the secondary content related to games. 
---
It's why when people here talk about things "everyone" wants it's just not accurate. My brother has 3 times the hours put into 76 that I do, and he's not savvy to any side content that goes beyond builds. 
---
I'm not saying that other people have the masks for sure. I'm just saying there are alot of players who aren't engaged online like members of this community are.
---
Every zone but toxic valley and cranberry bog has a nuclear plant.
---
If you make a group i’ll join ya
---
Paladin and elder exists.
---
Because your videos are clickbait trash.
---
Then how did they find a bunch of players with 100,000+ in duped inventory? 
---
Yeah, about 1 in 330k odds for a three star.
---
I’m selling super cheap if you want 
---
Most of the decoration plans are from there and they carry all of the resort decorations which are the nicest/ cleanest things you can put in your camp 
---
Fucking yes 
---
I’ll craft you one, pm me your GT. Might need a few resources but I should have most everything 
---
Radiation storms should also cause much more irradiation, and you should be able to get some protection from metal camp structures.
---
agreed tired of people killing my cow and my deathclaw. I have to tame a new one each time the deathclaw dies!
---
You can just have it. I don't have a need for the railway rifle. 
---
I'm not flush in Legendaries, but more people going barbarian mode is always excellent. 
---
Add me on Ps4. : Mootsmcboots
---
I'll be online later today.
---
I have not received them myself.  That list is a list of the paints I received and in the order I got them. 
---
Why do you find them to be clickbait/trash? I normally try to make titles interesting, but not misleading. The goal is for people to click on the video but not think it is about something else entirely. Naturally I don't always get that balance right. 
---
Also what about the videos is bad? Like my analysis or do you feel like I am just reading off of reddit posts (I've seen that criticized before)? 
---
Have a rare chance to obtain botulism - higher if CND low but not spoiled 
---
Thanks xD
---
I’m sorry I didn’t recognize you earlier, but thank you for all you do and I hope you’re having a great year so far.
---
It’s one thing for a website to say something is public domain and another to guarantee it for redistribution in a paid work.
---
This was a problem with the Sita Sings the Blues soundtrack which used 1920s Annette Hanshaw recordings which had various copyright issues with federal, state, and international law even if advertised as public domain.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita_Sings_the_Blues#Copyright_problems
---
Is Fallout 76 suposed to take place after a nuclear war or something? You certainly can't tell by looking around aside from the buildings being in poor repair. 
---
Hahaha I don’t know why I laughed so hard reading this. Lol but I am sorry that has happened to you. I just recently put down a fertilizer barrow and I hope that doesn’t happen to me. 
---
Selling copper ore and scraps and a lot of it for low prices because I have it in extreme excess 
---
There are a few pics floating around. Most of them sightings,two of them from people coming forward. Nobody has presented a screenshot of the mask actually dropping at the event though, and with regards to how many time the event has been run by the player base, there is a suspiciously low amount of evidence. It's hard to say if they are dropping for sure or not. I have run the event over 60 times with no luck so far.
---
From what I understand is that, the flat woods monster is a random encounter but places like 
---
Abby’s Bunker 
---
Dryer Chemical plant 
---
Wilson brothers auto repair 
---
Are places that have a increased chance of him being there 
---
Oh you don't have to apoligize lol, thanks man appreciate the support. I hope you're 2019 is going great also 
---
Even as a Canuck, I think Texas could be a freakin awesome spot for a Fallout game.
---
It's got such a distinct regional identity, excellent history, and landscapes. 
---
Ok unlike grafting monster which just spawned wherever and booty raped you at low levels 
---
There is a few fixed spawn locations for  the Grafton monster 
---
No need to thank us, having your stuff and free fast travel to Helvetia is pretty convenient by itself. I was one of those people who built a bigass house and never moved but after the update deleted my camp, I'm actually considering to do this again when we get the next limited event.
---
You can make it look really good if you choose the right spot and, with enough lights and stuff you'll see players noticing your Camp and paying a visit wheter they want to use your crafting stations or not. Also the plans from the event help your camp fit in.
---
Ill have to give that a try then!
---
Meat hook is sold by graham. Bought it earlier today on pc
---
It's Jesterskull25
---
If you're on PC I can join for some of the Fasnacht stuff. I do curse a lot but it's all in good fun.
---
İts a true fact Bethesda needs to do this
---
Yes I do:) this was my post about that awhile back and Bethesda said they were looking at it. The sad fact is however, even if the capability was there, Unarmed would still outmatch it
---

---
I hope you get to pick which bonus you want rerolled, but I the way they have been developing this game they don't do anything easy for the player.
---
 If I had to wager a guess it would be most likely reroll on all 3 bonuses.
---
 Hopefully though they go in depth with it where you can trade in 3 legendary 1 star items (all 3 the same type weapon or armor) for a 3 star.  The specific bonuses on each of the one star weapons would get transferred to the 3 star.
---
 But knowing this development team they are going to rely heavily on random number generators that more often than not don't work correctly.
---
Dude u just proved my point 🙈
---
Supersize Me was fake. Its already proven. Just google "supersize me fake". You find sources like forbes and wsj.
---
You can call Fox News "unreliable journalism" but the truth is they are not worse than any other channel. I would say MSNBC is even far worse.
---
You are just like the F76 haters. Just repeating what others say without checking the facts. Going down the easy route and joining the mob.
---
I had the chance to get a mega sloth once and missed it, how you finding animals to tame? I happen to only come across known spawn points which from what I’ve read are only able to be pacified. 
---
The Complacency Regulator would be good for me.
---
Others have gotten that. It’s a glitch. When you show up it’s some other creature 
---
I actually believe a few players that have been suspended. I don't believe they are all duplicators. Now did they have duplicated items? Well I guess they did or they wouldn't have been suspended.   
---
Point is outside of farming how does one buy full sets of matching BOS armor or multiples of legendary weapons all the same without duplicating them?  
---
So suspend someone that has 1,000 Nuka Colas but forget about the people selling all this legendary stuff? That's wrong all in itself. 
---
Just a text bug.  It shows up occasionally.  It can be mole rats, scorched, ghouls, super mutants, etc. 
---
It would definetly be cool if a fallout game would take place in Texas thoigh I wonder how Austin would be scaled to fit.
---
I have noticed a influx of younger children I'll call them hurling insults down the mic they dont understand and trying to instigate pvp by any means necessary. Tonight's been the worst night for it in 3 months of gameplay. Forget rolling on Wednesday when the servers are split.... roll on Monday when the kids are back at school!
---
You can kill youw own brahmin with plague walker
---
Show us the screenshot then?
---
Although new music is always great to have, I feel like it would ruin the surprise of hearing new songs in future Fallout games. If they cram a bunch of songs into 76 then there will less selection for new stuff in the future and most likely just recycle a lot of it again. 
---
Cool if you give me like 30 min I’ll invite you to a game!
---
There's a holotape saying the protectrons will be doing it forever so I fully expect them to have it happen every year. 
---
cool.........
---
Farm pleasant valley cabins. Lots of armor/weapon/mod plans plus 3 level 3 safes.
---
Start at top of the world. Armor bench can spawn 2 plans. The armor bench by the flame trap area has a spawn 
---
Then go to the wrecked house behind. There is a lvl 1 safe and occasionally a legendary. Sometimes a plan spawns upstaits on shelf or bed headboard.
---
Then there is a dilapidated house with a lvl 3 safe and another house with a trailer in front that also has a level 3 safe
---
Then go down the "vendor" row and in the booths are mods and plans
---
Then go thru the cabins. The cabin with a bench has a plan spawn next to it.
---
The last cabin has a level 3 safe
---
Go up the hill to the diner. Level 2 safe inside and 2 recipes in back
---
There are also some magazine and bobblehead spawns along this run
---
Gow do I show you the screenshot 
---
Thanks for offering but I finally found the right dome, I actually found the keys but couldn’t find the right one.
---
Upload the image to a website like imgur and post the link here.
---
No but it might be patched
---
I’m here if you wanna chill PS4 chat and playthrough
---
If you're talking about the text, that's nothing it's just a bug.
---
I wish they would bring “Its the end of the world” back from Fallout4 into 76.
---
It was just the text. It surprised me
---
Not rare
---
Contractor lvl2 and repair all. 
---
I noticed the same thing. When I was in the 70-90 range, it seemed EVERYONE, on the message boards was talking about their 3 stars and such, and selling stuff. Meanwhile I got nothing. Around lvl 90 I bought a 2* lever action, and suddenly I’m getting lots of 1-2* and an occasional 3*. I always wondered if some where in the mechanics of the game, you got a better chance of legendary stuff by your current level/area, mixed with how many you already owned. 
---
Got a spare one if your PS4 
---
The build itself or someone who uses one? I can link you the build I use.
---
Vegans...vegans everywhere! 
---
Scorched can drop legendary. It's super rare and I don't think that it displayed as a legendary monster when it happened to me. Somewhere north of 500 hours played, happened once in harpers
---
PC player.
---
Rare enough to never drop for me it seems :(
---
That’s always been there. It’s also where you can find s tinfoil hat.
---
Basically the trailer was the home of a guy that thought aliens were real but was a bit of a nut job.
---
Turns out he was right. 
---
Ah it's nothing then.
---
My melee build: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f314eb8&amp;d=sb0s42sm2sn2ss1pe2e60c72i11id0ih2s12i44a72a42a04lt2lu2l71se2&amp;w=&amp;n=PA%20Melee%20Build
---
I'm still on the fence, like I loved fasnaucht for the first 2 days (I probably ran it 50 times) so that was a great, but the 2 after survival have me worried. Player vending is really cool and I really love the idea but that's the content for the week? That's not gunna add more playability so hopefully I'm still distracted by survival mode, but the week after that it's the camera? Now that's not gunna add anything for me I barely use the camera system as it is, let alone a new limited camera system.
---
I'm super super excited for the last 3 but after survival I have to wait a month for anything I like or anything actually substantial
---
Are you guys going to put that shit in your grave stones? Just screw off already if you don't like it. Your opinion isn't unique, and we're sick if hearing it.
---
Yeah it uses flourescent. How many hours is that? My timezones GMT+8 so it's like 7:30am now.
---
It's on a loot table of 16 other items of equal dropping chance so 6.25% chance to drop per run,  If you do 50 runs there's a \~96% probability it will drop.
---
I have it equipped but it doesn’t change the values. 
---
I am excited!
---
 I can't wait to grind for hours on end for a .003% chance for the rare loot that will drop from the new events.  I hope they're so rare that nobody gets one. Not a single damn one.
---
 I mean just think of the possibilities what a super rare Halloween costume would look like. Then Bethesda can put them all over screenshots and event pages to show you just how awesome these outfits can be that you will never own. 
---
I'm stoked!
---
There are certain heavy guns that are part of the meta
---
It should make everything the half the cost. 😬
---
Easy, just blast 40% of it to smithereens.
---
I was bummed when end of the world by Skeeter Davis wasn't in 76
---
ive seen him halfway across town XD
---
Do you think Bethesda are aware of how much more people would enjoy the game with cross platform 
---
This is the first fallout where I don't really use the radio. Not cuz the music is bad but because I love the ambience music
---
Yes. That’s when he’s a Wall-Mart.
---
Where can they be found, the resort is huge.
---
And who said murder and friendship can't work side by side..
---
Maybe it doesn’t work for repairing? I’m comparing the costs with it equipped and not equipped and it isn’t changing. 
---
I just don't get why people like you visit this forum. I would never read in a forum of a game i don't like. You are truly obsessed.
---
I thought if you moved your camp just a bit everything would be repaired?  Have had to try it myself yet
---
In the main trading area by artisans corner 
---
Which ones? I never noticed. Then again I haven’t turned on the radio since the beta.
---
Haha... you got a nice audible groan out of me.  I hope your proud of yourself!
---
Flaming barbed pitchfork. Goes wonderful with the Old Man Summer mask and a tuxedo.
---
I guess I need to keep doing more runs huh.
---
was not aware of that thanks 
---
I remember that asshole from the music  / film industry 
---
that went before before congress in the 90's and messed  up the public domain 
---
It should be 75 years from the  artists death  for books and film 
---
and 50 years for music 
---
It'd be fun to play with other platforms.
---
You forgot to circle the exceedingly rare part of that paragraph 😉
---
Yeah ok but which 40% do you blast, especially since I'm not very familiar with all the big Austin landmarks.
---
Exactly 
---
Now if only I could find him...
---
Its an event it starts randomly
---
Patch by patch they nerf melee weapons 
---
I've been everywhere looking for the sledgehammer... I can't find it either 
---
I've never even been to Austin, just nuke 40% of it and compress the rest so people go "bro I ate Chipotle right fucking there!". Fallout 5: Austin.
---
we are most likely going to be getting taxadermy stuff at some point due to the files so hooray!
---
On a related note, anyone knows the name of the tune that plays in the Pi Mu's basement jukebox?
---
That's one of the most ear-wormy tune I've heard since the Plant vs Zombies soundtrack.
---
For the higher level animals you need a lot of points into charisma and animal companion perk maxed
---
Can I have 20 or 30 at a few caps each, I’m broke rn... my psn is my reddit username
---
Power Armor mods. I was fortunate enough to find the X-01 jet pack mod on the Enclave vendor last night, but now I need pure cobalt and violet flux to attach it to the X-01 torso. 
---
This must be why everyone's Brahmin turns red when I approach? Thanks for pointing that out. I'll keep my distance. 
---
A challenge easier for someone low-level to do? MADNESS!!
---
Not really, no. It's fiddly and overcomplicated.
---
If it feels more optimistic at 11 runs you're at about 50%. :)
---
Heres the messed up reasoning. They needed a high bounty to attract high lvl players to come claim it. While the player with the bounty sits in the open the other 2 guys are waiting to ambush anyone who attacks. The messed up part is the guy with the bounty probably doesn’t even have caps so they lose nothing when they’re killed. 
---
The good news is that with the new pacifist mode your camp will be safe as long as you don’t attack anyone or have a bounty. The bad news is Bethesda doesn’t seem to care about zero cap PvP exploits, at least I can’t see any response from them about it. 
---
Sorry that happened to you but it should be the last time once the changes come out next week. 
---
Yeah when you come on we will discuss price you will have to add me though:brettboy2014
---
Pretty rare. Anyone who says it’s not has really good RNG chances. I ran it 50+ plus and only got two 
---
In my experience, if you farm with other high levels, you can often "upgrade" low star legendaries if you see them spawn in events and such. But this seems to be a very strange mechanic, because they have the chance to drop no legendary even without dropping syringe or drill. This might be if you hit it too early when it has no stars, you'll be given loot from that table, but only a theory. 
---
I use an auto combat rifle for mid-range combat. It's very effective vs super mutants and snallygasters.  Ammo crafting perk is a must though. 
---
I have this really cool photo of two rad storms making a kind of corridor front Vault 76 down to Flatwoods. Took it back in beta. 
---
Theyre going for like 15-20k right now on ps4
---
Or just use the CAMP device. You fast travel to right in front of it.
---
Weapon displays are already coming as per bethesda
---
All u need is rank 3 of animal perk and to be higher lvl than the animal u wanna tame and has to be a lone animal at one of the "random" spawns but u only need 3 points of charisma 
---
Yeah, I'm saying there should be some severe rad storms.
---
We're in the same timezone I believe, its 7:37PM here.
---
This would be awesome! 
---
Depends on the gun. Maybe more mechanical bits crammed in the barrel. 
---
I'd love to have Soldier Boy by The Shirelles
---
Yeah today was the first time since beta I saw him.
---
Was by overseers camp
---
I had a complete psychopath blow up my camp while I was in it crafting with my girlfriend. I mean, almost completely leveled it. The sweet irony though was that their excessive attack in such a small area with lots of exploding generators killed them. They respawned though and were coming back to finish the job when I server hopped. It was incredibly upsetting at the time, but we know now that's the nature of the beast. Some players are rockstars and others are literally raiders.
---
Fair enough
---
I’ll add interior ceilings please
---
I have a spotify playlist of my own and listen to that instead. I add new stuff to it all the time to keep it fresh.
---
Didnt one of the DLCs in the old fallouts add a few new songs?...thought i remember that.
---
I like the fallout radio...just gets repeditive. 
---
Do other people get this sunny weather without skies and green lighting from rad storms without sounds? 
---
Well the Devs created a pretty cool looking cooler for the Fasnacht event so it has to be coming to us sooner or later
---
I’ve got my old quad prime lever sitting in my stash. If you still need. 
---
Shittt, been trying to find a weapon to stick with . Thanks tho :)
---
12 hours apart. But yeah that'll work.
---
I've wrecked a few I'll admit
---
I used to 2 or 3 shot lvl 68 super mutants with all rise and now its like 6 or 7. No unyielding armor pieces or anything. 
---
Ya so rare not a single person from reddit, facebook, twitter or youtube have got one... great job Bethesda 👍
---
Fallout 76 is the Donald Trump of games. People join the hate train just for the sake of it. 
---
I’ve done about 50 runs and have 2. I think it’s rare. 
---
8 hours to get to 50? With what exploits? Lol
---
They do. Proof: my friend (who had not joined my team yet) killed my cow to see what would happen. In doing so, they destroyed my "fertilizer producer". They became wanted.
---
I've been thinking about this. And think probably not - murder builds are really good (nearly god-like) at doing that one thing.  These are not producers who loot, scrap, grow, build.  These are top-tier predators that murder and steal the fruits of regular players.
---
BUT... I'm wondering how many players with murder builds will even want to jump to PVP.  These players are true parasites in PVE - they are usually stealth and built for one/two shot player kills, can't carry much and survive by murdering and pillaging people using workshops or griefers who destroy CAMPS.  That's their resourcce farming - murdering people and taking their stuff.  What happens when parasites move to PVP?  If they don't grind for resources then it's essentially empty pocket murderers killing and looting from other empty pocket murderers. Someone will need to farm, grow, and harvest and process resources to be murdered and stolen from in PVP.  I'm thinking these guys will stay and murder innocents in PVE as it's easy pickings.  
---
I was hoping PVP was a one way street - go PVP stay PVP.  Looks like it might be do PVP get god weapons exculsive to PVP  server come back and murder torture regular folks in PVE with new PVP attained god weapons. Still waiting for details on how that will work.
---
And watch all the low levels get pile drived. Lol
---
They claim just going to dense mob regions based on what level you are and just focus on pve.
---
off, if you're around right now, I have a few minutes
---
Yeah that'd be a lot more fun, but those robots would get smashed up hard. It does make the masks a bit more rare though.
---
Hi there I'm a dataminer. you can find me in the discord server for this reddit by the same tag name
---
Oh it’s bugged. I have enough junk but now it won’t repair all 🙄
---
Am I the only one that thinks Appalachia Radio is extremely lackluster compared to GNN and Diamond City Radio?
---
They were trying. Sony is just outright against it for no good reason. 
---
Xbox here, and I have 4 out of 30 runs.. I'm taking a hell of a time getting the plans
---
Sadly that doesn’t surprise me but adventure mode 0 damage coming next week. All the hardcore pvp folks will be in survival.
---
The only possible way to get to level 50 in 8 hours would be to farm nuked white springs, and even then I still don’t think you could do that in only 8 hours.
---
Trying not to go Ultracite.
---
I got it on my first run through. When I wear it my head is invisible...
---
Yeah I’ve had that happen to me before. Weird thing is, none of the 3 guys had a bounty. Either they killed each other to get rid of it or died that quickly to someone else.
---
I've seen people run into white springs and then train out to the car in the lot, explode thr car and suicide into leveling. But it involves a lot of luck and server hopping so not the fastest. But ... 8 hours to 50 is pretty hardcore. 
---
i have bloody mess and this did not work for me earlier today. shouldve waited for the meatpile, but assumed it would never come
---
Until your power armor is literally there for defense cause you're fucking stronger. Weak ass power armor :(
---
Survival is also jus beta so I suspect it will evolve n change a bit too!! Cant wait to find out tho!!
---
If you’re on PlayStation I could make you one.
---
Or at least mix up the tune in The Whitespring vendor area. That song repeating drives me nuts sometimes! 
---
I think it is really likely they do. Behind the spacestation is a door that leads nowhere (doesn't even say inaccesible or anything). I haven't heard of anything as to what this is about from dataminers or leaks, but you have to imagine it'll be something. 
---
I found mine in a paper bag lol
---
Likely see more in the summer event (due to the name)
---
I'll be on survival next week if you care to join? 
---
Mostarzanasa79 I have them, and lots of others. Serums too. send me a message and we can coordinate.
---
I disagree I want survival and for me it will be more than playable
---
The game is more alive than ever. Jump in and have fun! The game community is really awesome.
---
If you were wanted and didn’t realize it then they wouldn’t get a bounty from attacking your camp. I also believe if you had a workshop and they claimed it, initiating PvP, then they can attack your camp without repercussion. 
---
Sounds like some raiders to me, sure they’re part of the game but they still suck and are total cowards cause they’re always in groups. 
---
JUST KILLED MYSELF. Fuck my luck. I should test again... I'm afraid.
---
Sorry forgot to mention PC 😅
---
The game is not dead and is very much worth getting into if you like grinding games, as there is a lot of it. The games community is also super nice and friendly as the toxic people don’t like it and don’t play and the few toxic people that do play are few and far between
---
i turn it off and slap on the fallout Spotify radio. sorted. 
---
So long as you don't mind my stoic silence. 😁
---
I have the ribbons pole plans. Adding you now 
---
same, never seen one
---
No, you don't? 
---
People traveling to your camp land where you first place it. You land in a direction around it, and typically have to fiddle with it's placement to put you at a good spot. 
---
A fast travel mat would solve this issue. 
---
Yeah I hear ya. I wasn’t wanted and recently hopped serves so didn’t have any workshops. They might have killed them selves to get rid of it, but oh well. 
---
Maybe it will see more use as part of the cryptid quests? 
---
Hand made and lever action are my 2
---
I wish they would do this too. I get tired of trying to find a workaround to fix these flaws. Not to mention the outright amazing structures we could build if we had freedom to do what we want. Still staying within the camp budget though, dont want the servers to fall apart anymore
---
For real??? 
---
This is what im using https://fextralife.com/fallout-76-the-ultimate-melee-build-guide/
---
Yeah I'm excited about how they are doing it. Only dropping random aid items I can work with!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aa266t/fast_ways_to_level_up/  
---
Not saying this guy is truthful, but seems legit.
---
You’re missing all the fun of the game if you’re just trying to fast level. 
---
Integrate spotify into the pipboy 😁😁😁
---
X-01 is dope but the carry weight is absolute garbage lol 
---
I made a giant barn with all the benches, right at the end of town at the T in the road. This morning, someone attacked it and destroyed every bit of it. I keep trying to use the camp to repair all but it's not working, so I'm repairing piece by piece.  I was pissed. I'm so excited for the survival mode update so that my non pvp character camp doesn't get blown up by jerks. 
---
It's not even like they get my junk like if they would have killed me. Just ruin my camp for me and everyone else. 
---
Lucky fucker!
---
I promise, had one scorched flying inside walls, could see her, but she did. At the end of the cavern there were two non-bugged ones waiting afk on the ground. And then I had to stay 15 min trying to kill the "ghost" through the walls moving everywhere. She followed me since the beginning of caverns thill the end. 
---
I've seen that from time to time when people get one.
---
Yes! Imagine if you could get gambling table plans and play card games( black jack, Texas hold ‘em e.t.c.) that could make for some sick in game casinos. Imagine nuclear winter introduced a quest like nukashine, but you could get slot machines and randoms could come around and gamble abit( you get proceeds) or you could host card games or pool. 
---
You get one later on as a quest reward in the main quest
---
You could try some government aid drops.  They'll show up in those randomly.  What platform are you on?  I'm not sure if I have the plans , but if you're on PC I can make you one.  
---
Man. You gotta keep a few weapons. I always keep a shotgun of some type for close encounters. Keep my lever action for midrange ones. My melee is the All rise. 
---
Agreed. There are some fun and helpful people in the FO community. On occasion you will encounter people who just want to cause trouble and grief, but most seem to be decent. 
---
I try to ‘pay it forward’ a bit anonymously by putting extra ammo, food, water, chems, low level gear, etc. in the overseers camp box. I’ll do this occasionally at train stations in suitcases or lunch boxes as well.
---
This really is a great game, and it’s the nice players that make it even more enjoyable. 
---
Yeah I'm aware but I'd rather get one sooner that that haha
---
......
---
I believe I have all of those. Do you have an extra donut recipe? 
---
Level 20 is kinda low to be using a gatling gun and you will probably have trouble finding one
---
Mods, remove them.
---
I think someone identified the Crashed Space Station as a marked location on one of the roadmap screenshot. So it's possibly it will be part of the upcoming cryptid/sheepsquatch content. If not, then the name of the updates "Wild Wasteland" would certainly be wasted if it didn't add anything new to the Station.
---
Yeah I've been trying those with no luck unfortunately. I am on pc!
---
What’s the trade off? I just started using the X01. Doesn’t seem too different to me. 
---
I literally just tried it again and saved a clip of it. Works for me on PS4 just fine, lol.   
---
[Experimental MIRV test.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK5wB-TXYzY)
---
Add Ultra3030 and I'll see if I can whip one up for ya.  I'll be online in about 20 min
---
Yeah I just remember getting one on my first character at around level 20 or so from a super mutant but that was when the game first came out so I wasn't sure if there was anywhere I could get one now.
---
I have an extra one for you
---
Yes, I was on the roof of a building on Helvetia, aiming to the legendary megasloth, so was kinda out of range for the explosion, then it hit the sloth (Wich was far away) and we both exploded. The funny thing is that I had a poor soul (15 caps bounty) just next to me at the roof. So at least I gained 15 caps.
---
This. Youtube is becoming more and more Hatetube. Its not just Fallout 76. Since those hatetubers realized they can get a lot of clicks with negativity they did it now with pretty much every game. Its a clear trend. 
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I do!
---
Part of the weekly challenge is to do 10 events while naked, intoxicated and on chems. Fasnacht is a low risk event. 
---
Just as much as the alcohol. 
---
Thank you so much!
---
It keeps coming up. And every time it’s the same response. 
---
Despite the fact people don’t really buy physical music media anymore. I remember how great the GTA rereleases for Xbox were because you could download tracks to the Xbox and play those on the in game radio. 
---
I had to remove my mods to get the atom shop stuff to show. Turns out the mod needed to be updated.
---
You just gotta turn that record over, you ain’t heard nothin’ yet!
---
X-01 has the highest energy resistance of any power armor set by a decent margin. It also has excellent radiation resistance. However, it falls below both T-51 and Ultracite in terms of ballistic damage resistance. Every suit can protect you pretty well, but some do better than others in certain scenarios. 
---
I've done that with bobbypins.  🤣
---
Locksmith IRL.
---
Get the fix it good perk,it will make a huge difference in how much you are repairing.
---
Daaaaang, I'm sorry. Lol. I posted a vid to show I'm not trying to troll or nothin' like that. It really does work for me on PS4. I've no clue why it'd be doing that to you. :/
---
