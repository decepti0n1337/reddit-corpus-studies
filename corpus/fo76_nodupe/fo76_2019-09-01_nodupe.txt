When you launch a nuke you have a personal timer of 3 hours on that silo. If someone else has launched a nuke it will be 3 hours until that silo can launch again.

---
I've wondered this too! I've had this happen when using a crafting bench, and I wonder if people can see me miming chopping up a hunk of meat.
---
Could you do a doorway and switch back to solid wall? I haven’t tried that method yet
---
Thanks.  I went to Aaronholt but it spawned some pieces of (level 30) T-51b.  I guess I'll just keep farming the raider spots for the other raider pieces I need.
---
Does the planetarium ever workV
---
Also, how exactly did you think new players are still exiting 76 over a year after it was supposed to go dark? Only logical sense is that the issued GECK was rigged to provide remaining residents food and power.
---
shotgun
---
No. I’ve had to explain it so many times. Look up angry turtle magic weapons
---
cool beans
---
True. I’m on PS4 so that’s not even my world I live in
---
Thanks.  I scrapped a couple.  It is kinda tricky though because frames all look the same in inventory but some actually have armor on them.  Only way to tell is to put it down and look.  Would suck to accidentally scrap all the armor on a frame too.
---
Last weekend, I filled my nuka-cola fridge, with it's 15 allowable contents. Then I tried adding the ice box as well, was able to add another 15 items. So apparently, I was unaware, that you can have multiple fridges/ice boxes, and each one has their own 15 allowable contents.
---
I do not miss the endless spam and chat from other games. I like how peaceful it is.
---
Through "Picking Up the Trail" and "Finding the Garden of Eden" it is made known to use that not all Vaults were equipped with one of the two models of G.E.C.K. (Normally they would be issued two of them as well unless it's Fallout 2) The fact that Vault 76 is such a luxurious vault only further proves how ridiculous it is for the residents not to be equipped with these essential tools. 
---

---
You're using circular reasoning here....fucking Schrödingers G.E.C.K. Yes, because we don't see one used does not mean that we didn't have one, but it also doesn't mean that we did have one....The Overseer is definitely not stupid woman by any means, and it would be a break of character for her to leave such an important piece of technology behind. Either Bethesda has dog shit writing or we never had one to begin with.
---
Yea it takes several shots (10?) for Furious to reach max power, try a Gatling, it’s slower firing but hit harder, perfect for crowd control
---
Remember they removed the ability to switch?
---
You can absolutely do the missions solo! I usually play solo, though it’s definitely fun with other people.
---

---
If V76 got a GECK there would be no reason for F76 to be a game.  You go outside, terraform, crack a beer and the game is over.
---
So I hear what you are saying and I do think there is a place for vats with melee.  BUT, some counter points:
---
Everything dies in one hit with melee, making value of crits questionable.  Exception is on bosses, but psycho isn't much of a factor when you are concentrating on one target.
---
I suppose when there are adds you could go all vats-gunfu-psycho on them to build up adrenaline and a crit for the boss, but seems like alot of trouble and you will probably get a crit on 6 attacks anyway without psycho.  
---
Adrenaline is going to have a MUCH bigger effect on damage overall, and even perks like bloody mess is probably more.  There are alot of good perks and it's hard to justify going heavy into luck as melee.
---
It's like in fallout 4. If you throw it at enemies moving you will probably miss them cuz it's really slow to reach the target. Only useable at stationary enemies, like at a workshop, event or enemies sitting around a building.
---
Refer to edit.
---
Worse loading times than FO4? Are you kidding me lol. They are like a tenth the time of fo4. 4 had load screens for almost every building lol
---
I agree, that’d be a good spot for it too.
---
Well they aren’t real.
---
So basically... Never. 
---
(I joke, but I understand. Thanks!)
---
Remember they added it back last week?
---
I had someone do that to me last night! I told him it was an alt character and hopefully I find something to gift back to him after all he did. It’s nice to see people willing to help new players, I suppose it’s about time I try to do the same. One wasteland for all!
---
Oh, I didn’t know!
---
I agree. Ace is cool.
---
Modus can neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program at this time.
---
That's just a meta element that exists in the game to allow new players to come into the game. Canonically we all exit the vault on Reclamation Day.
---
Yup! Just tested it out last night also.
---
It was a great way to get quick screws for 1 steel, you'd just craft with super duper and it was worth it. Also, Assaultron Helmets dont need fiber optics.
---
I just mean that it doesn't seem worth it to do ACP for 300 ammo
---
It a shame that people want the attention, but can't take simple criticism or truths about the reality of this game. It truly sounds like a bunch judgmental hypocrites  that aren't willing to allow others to have their opinions heard,  because they can't handle the truth. 
---
I should just join them to be ban, after ridiculing them for being so judgmental and insecure with there own reality. Personaly they need to get over themselves. Lol. 
---
I am honestly surprised I haven't been ban, from here for some of my sly remarks over the last two years. I tell it how it is, if you don't like it, than feel free to debate it with me, if you run your mouth, than be able to back it up, its that simple. 
---
On another note, I do wish you, and everyone all the best! 🙂
---
You do know that other players don’t see the names you give to items, right?
---
No. Go to /r/gaming if you want to spam memes. I'm so happy this is a discussion-only forum. Last thing I want is this sub to be flooded with rule34 deathclaw fantasies.
---
Gift emote, drop the goods, shoot the loot bag, gift emote again
---
I also have the armor I want, so...
---
we need a confirm trade button for bartering.
---
How were you able to do 3 at a time when they’re all on a set timer? Not trying to be accusatory, I just can’t get the math right in my head
---
I never thought of it that way. It's true that there are virtually no screaming squeakers or super salty try hards. I'm very grateful for that.
---
If you got the time I’d recommend just dumping your raider and t-45 PA’s and go for the strangler heart PA or the T-65 armor. WELL WORTH THE GRIND and I run a bloodied/food slugger build lol.
---
My tripwire laser seems to have a render distance. You leave or enter the area, the laser is gone but trap is still active. If I toggle the switch, the laser turns back on. Very frustrating.
---
He is an adorable little bot
---
No. Stop worrying about this because:
---
A) the change is inevitable
---
B) the change is inevitable
---
C) the change is inevitable
---
When I go to unlink them, it says it'll delete all the data and stuff.  But I'm think because I actually have two instances of the game that doesn't matter, right?
---
look up his name on social / recent to thank him
---
Yeah that’s the place
---
76 has very few buildings
---
I sold an Intelligence Bobble head for 42 caps.
---
Honestly yeah haha. It's really fun to use though! Which is why there should not be such a limit for using it as it's so  far away from being op.
---
I am truly sorry to hear about your loss, I haven't found that companionship in game yet. I hope that you find new love 💘 in the future.
---
If you're solely logging on and playing just to fulfill daily limits and nothing else, you have to really ask yourself if you're having fun at all.
---

---
I didn’t realise that turrets can shoot through the communist fence. Giving them a clear line of sight without having them awkwardly on rooftops is always a pain, I might have to buy it after all...
---
It’s the only logical answer, though.  Either that or the GECK is something very expensive to produce, so they can’t just give them out like candy.  Possibly the experiment was to test resiliency and the rugged, independent reputation of West Virginians?  Even that doesn’t really make any sense or the vault would have opened immediately.  Best not to search for plot holes in a video game.
---
What this guy said.
---
Forceful stock makes a huge difference on durability, and not alot of difference on anything else
---
Jesus, sorry for asking.  Of course I should have know to search angry turtle, what was I thinking
---
You lucky bastard.
---
It is pretty expensive, but they gave us all private rooms and fuckin colored tv....over terraforming equipment. 76 is supposed to be a control, but the Overseer confirms that she had a secret mission. Her mission was to get control of the Nuke Sites as far as an experiment for the residents there wasn't one....that we know of.
---
Have the same problem... Don't know if I'll be doing that
---
My camp is currently a square with benches,but before,some of my projection lights were always working and some not(beside the first time I placed). There must a trick about it,but it could be anything'
---
I can't hit a thing with my caster.  Put it on vats and it's a sniper from hell.  I can shoot at things point blank and miss every time though.
---
It has more than you’d think. Every single one would have a loading screen in fo4. Not the case in 76, and the ones that do usually take less than 20 seconds. I don’t know about you, but I never had a loading screen the short in FO4 lol. Maybe you haven’t played 4 in awhile. Go back, it’s painful. Things like generals steakhouse would probably have a 2 minute load in FO4.
---
Basically boils down to the harder you hit per shot the worse the nerf will be in terms of your output per shot. It's alarmist to say it will ultimately kill this build though as what is true for the PTS doesn't necessarily transition to live. Ultimately I'll stick with rifleman just to avoid using tens of thousands of ammo to do anything. After all, I didn't pick this build to win a DPS race.
---
Haven’t met a lot of people with the same problem. Talked about it a lot on facebook groups and it almost seemed like I’m the only one. In other words a last priority fix.
---
The rolls are entirely random, but at least you’re guaranteed a 3star for completion.  I guess that’s nice.
---
I do the event for fun.  I have all the rewards, but it’s something to do.
---
If you’re looking for maximum efficiency, saving 5000 scrip for the 50% Purveyor sale is where it’s at.  Outside of that, the usual farming spots will give you the best odds of landing something useful.  RNG is about volume.
---
I don’t think I could stop buying or selling three items if I tried it’s invaded my personality now
---
Make a LFG post whenever it pops up, you’ll get high levels (as long as your server isn’t full) flooding in
---
All secret service unyielding +1S and chance to reduce damage while sprinting/standing still split 50/50.
---
I’m seeing less people and xp grinding events like Radiation Rumble. Same number of people though
---
Yeah but mole miner gauntlet and deathclaw gauntlet are pretty close.
---
With the right build everything dies in one hit with unarmed anyway.  I have a junkies build, bloodied is even more so.  I actually use a vampire's death tambo for general mobs, kills just as fast and saves stimpacks for ISS.
---
i've been to a few acp events where 3-5 players are using a tesla my fps are fine, could connection speed or some other factor be contributing to the fps drop that some players are experiencing?
---
secret service. Cuz it's literally the best
---
It's really not, but I stand in astonishment of this comment.  Damn fine misdirection that made me question things for a few seconds.
---
The switch box wall mounted power connector shows green even though it's off. If I switch it on and then turn it off it will correctly show red. Resets to green anytime I switch servers.
---
I did not ask for your armor set. Stop making me jealous. Or I will be forced to use my superior tactical knowhow to terminate you.
---
How are they able to damage your base? Are you hostile with them?
---
everything should reset twice daily, at noon and midnight, instead of the 20 hour thing
---
I think I check teo of those spots eveyday and I never found a case there.
---
Also 9 endurance? Nah thx.
---
When it wants to.

---
The damage nerf hits builds that rely on stacking buffs to get huge instances of damage the hardest. Any build that depends on killing mobs in one or two shots is going to be hit hard. This includes rifleman, bow, and pistols.
---
Continued, sustained damage is going to be the “new” meta. Automatic weapons, automatic rifles, and swing speed melee are going to be the strongest builds, same as always.
---
What this does not mean is that those builds are “dead in the water.” All builds should still be viable, but to varying degrees of efficiency. The changes will more impact legendary prefixes than anything else IMO. If a weapons prefix doesn’t offer up front damage to all enemies like bloodied, junkies, or instigating, or strong utility like vamps, they are going to plummet in value.
---
As a PA Heavy Gunner build user ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f347e58&amp;d=sg2sq2s32sr2s22eu0eh2pe2c72cm2id2ir2ip2ic4a71a12lt2lg2l71&amp;w=ib4a04lu2la2c13ej2e30sf2ce0c61&amp;m=1c24fegh3&amp;am=182a38-182a38-182a38-182a3a-182a3a&amp;wp=w7w7w7&amp;wm=142534-1l2534-142835 ) i can tell you that yes it can work, but it is not optimised. To optimise a Melee build, you need a full Unyielding armor set.
---
But you still can manage to build a pretty good tank in a power armor. It may become pretty popular soon, with the addition of legendary perks. "Take one for the team" is pretty interesting, i'm highly thinking working on it first, as it gives a 40% team dmg buff against enemies attacking you. Boss fights are gonna be fun !
---
Legendary perk cards list: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_perks
---
If you mean legendary effects, I’m a full health vampire tank, so I go with vanguard
---
My magic gauss minigun only actually works when I'm the only one shooting him, if someone else takes a shot, even one other person, I do less than normal damage.
---
Same with damage from my 2525 fixer.
---
Is this the new god mode?
---
its a good point
---
I haven't used any of the ones that recharge them, but I do use one that combines partially charged fusion cores together and haven't had any issues with that one.
---
I have 3 sets of power armour... I know what my xo one is because I’ve got an atom skin on it, so when I need my ore gatherer I take the other two out and place them to see what’s what.... NOW I LEARN I CAN NAME THEM?!?!?
---
that was broken in one of the last 2 updates, beth has to see what they changed that fucked that up and then unfuck it in an upcoming update.
---
I think we’re playing the experiment.  What happens when you put a bunch of overdeveloped superheroes in an isolated  environment?
---
Yeah but that would be ideal too.
---
 have been in Deep pocketed Polished or Alloyed heavy metal, with WR.
---
335 DR for a full set.
---
Still working in a full set of SS, which has slightly less DR, but way better RR and ER.
---
There are certain modifier/gun combinations that screw with server time as it calculated damage so it sort of guesses what the damage is to the significant benefit of the player.
---
Check out r/overwatch to learn why this is a bad idea long term.
---
Can you send messages?
---
Drunken wandering is the best way to explore the wasteland!
---
It's pretty clear to see why they changed that. Ballistics fiber is a particularly difficult to find item, especially early on.
---
Omg same. 🥺
---
I’ve had the same troubles, I wasn’t in pacifist mode so they would punch me until the electrically charged serum kicked in and damaged them. From there they would shoot me to initiate combat and proceed to blow up or mow down my entire camp.
---
Keep a 0c vendor behind a level 3 lock at your camp.  Unlock and "follow me" when you see a low level there.
---
Edit: spelling
---
He is! All the new robots were a major plus for the Wastelanders expansion.
---
For my bloodied commando I run unyielding bos heavy combat, my junkies character is vanguard heavy combat and my bloodied melee is unyielding secret service. It all depends on your build
---
I think they’ll stay the same just not as effective and the bad metas are fucked
---
Sometimes I find failed runs where you farm ammo better than actually finishing it since the legendaries I get are mostly trash
---
Don't forget the acid.
---
I don’t get it I have a magic weapon but can’t burn him that fast?  Is it because I’m not a bloody build? I’ve run him a good dozen times and never seen him melt that fast.

Please Bethesda 🥺
---
Nerf isn't as bad as you may think.
---
If you can one shot enemies on the body, aim for the head and you will still one shot them.
---
Otherwise you need to use a second bullet to get the job done, auto rifle will be more valuable than single shot as most fire rates are near doubled when auto.
---
In the end its more about your play style than the weapons you use. Perfect your sneak build with a silenced weapon and you'll be fine!
---
Are you sure?
---
No fun allowed
---
I think 200 was required as a suggested buffer but framerate and consistent hit trajectory is most important.
---
I agree.  There’s some perk space to play with as a melee build, but I’d rather invest in things other than crits and vats.  Extra defense, carrying lots of steaks to perpetually maintain extra damage while jumping from one event to the other, etc.
---
I once bought an Explosives Bobblehead for 200 caps. I've found hundreds of Bobbleheads in the wild but never found an explosives one. I needed it for the set. Of course as soon as I bought one I come across it everywhere.
---
I’ve played since beta...I’ve never been more surprised. Mind...blown.
---
All awesome ideas! Esp would love to have an apartment in Charleston and a house like Hornwright estate. One of the little villas on Whitespring or a room in the hotel would be cool too.
---
On PTS, non-automatic rifles do almost the same one shot damage compared with automatics, but 20% fire rate, double VATS cost, no groud pounder perk. Okay, don't worry about anything, it's well balanced. Feel free to be a rifleman.
---
That would take a lot of bait!
---
I’m not sure if he meant he was using the event to farm ammo. I interpret it to be the fact that you complete an endgame event that rewards multiple legendaries and unique cosmetics while only investing item degradation.
---
Sorry if it wasn't clear enough. You use the terminal to LOCATE your desired target by selecting "Reveal Enemies". Enjoy ;)
---
Certain effects on legendary weapons/armor give exponential and potentially uncapped damage allowing easy instagib of even the most hardened end-game content.
---
I should be able to place partially depleted cores in my fusion generator at the base and have them slowly recharge. Just plop them in there like an inventory and let it do the work.
---
I know there are many briefcase spawn locations throughout the map, but the ones at Arktos spawn something like 75% of the time.
---
Gauss minigun?
---
One downside to this is that you must sacrifice other good perk cards for the Ghoulish and Hacker perks. Also, the yellow dots are simply terminals, Arktos is where you need to check for the case.
---
So what you’re basically saying is, assuming I have all the plans/atomic items that the other person on the team has, I can blueprint and make it my own? That’s awesome.
---
Please no.  People can post pictures, but there are limitations, and god no I don’t ever want this to allow memes.  So many other gaming subreddits have been rendered useless by allowing pictures.
---
Like r/dnd You’d  think  that’d  be    great  sub  to  get  questions  answered,  talk  about  rule  interactions,  upcoming  releases?  Nope  -  here’s  a  million  picures  of  random  player  characters ,  many  times  not  even  from  any  actual  D&amp;D  content
---
It’s so bad people have to create \*other\* subreddits just to actually talk about the game in question.  
---
That and pictures are low effort.  I could get a stupid picture of some glitch in the game and post it, and since it’s a picture people just upvote it.  Pictures are always upvoted far more than posts.  
---
As bad the sub is, I’d rather actually have discussion on the game, not it devolve into “LOL look at this funny super mutant that died in a weird position”
---
Huh, TIL
---
thanks
---
Every time I try to set up a trade on the Market sub, the other person never sees me online
---
It's so aggravating
---
I care more about effects than type in general.. as long as is has whatever effect I need/desire whatever has the highest resistances is fine with me..
---
when I find something better in some way than a piece I have equipped I swap it out
---
where you can only redeem 20 per day?
---
i have 1500 treasury notes just sitting there that i will never be able to redeem because of the limits.  at least legendaries i can sell if i am maxed out.
---
I think the only way to get it above 200 is with the faster fire rate legendary effect.
---
Yeah I agree. They recently showed with the banning then immediate unbanning of all the dupers that they really can't afford to lose a big chunk of the player base
---
steel as well
---
Lol no shit
---
You don't
---
How come?
---
I use mine to bomb camps within proximity of my own. I grab some artillery grenades, shut down my store (hides me from map), go into stealth, fast travel to their base, and throw the grenade. The best is when the dude is IN his base and has no idea what's going on. Hiding behind a tree watching some dude jumping around in panic while explosions happen around him is amusing. The 300m radius definitely needs an increase. I recommend like 1500.
---
Everyone knows
---
If any of the OG players come here they can vouch, they will know my name based on my name here. I also gave credit to the guy who truly first found out about it.
---
Gotcha! Thanks for the info.
---
Id say it should actually be unethical or possibly illegal to time gate any game, especially the time gate being totally illogical and artificial. You wanna build a castle? ok that takes time, but HOW and WHY i cannot carry more than 30K caps? 1000 scrips, and can only exchange 20 Notes ? lolAt least anything over the limit should go into our damn tiny stash stuff wont go to waste.We shouldn't even need gold bullions, we should be able to directly buy from the SS with notes anyway...
---
I played so much overwatch but never joined the sub somehow. That community is horrible though so that's why I never joined it. Just figured this community is better and could handle it
---
So why do you need to crit?
---
It’s hit or miss. Found a vendor about six months ago that had every serums RECIPE!!!!! For 500 caps. Spent every cap I had.....
---
I'm high af right now and it took 20 minutes to read this, but I appreciate it and agree 100%
---
I only wear power armor. I just feel like a tank and I honestly play better when I wear it.
---
I was thinking you could turn as much junk gear into scrip as you want, so it doesn’t clog up stash space, and be able to spend 1000 per day.  It would be the same as it is now, just without inventory bloat.
---
Sacrifice three radtoads to the PewPew gods
---
I agree. Hopefully this info spreads like wildfire and they fix it, or so many people try to spawn at Arktos that they end up killing each other and as a result I don't get nuked as much.
---
Huh, colour me surprises that a subreddit created purely out of aversion to criticism has some issues.
---
Didn’t work for me until I read all documents, analyzed sample, then installed fuse. Third attempt.
---
I didn't think i would have to mention the huge amounts of junk you get and stimpacks and legendaries and flux and plans and rewards and the FUN! 
---
And then i go outside and get loads of flux and stuff to make flux.
---
i play it
---
Ah, I was still thinking the Meat Week event.  
---
Still, I don't see the point of doing it at all unless you're aiming to get 100 ore turned in.  Anything less than 100 and you have 0% chance of getting the rare rad barrel plan.
---
Right! I have to send them a paragraph every time explaining the situation and telling them they can’t be in a private world.
---
Well, I've seen plenty of people say so because they did not drop until the last Meat Weak. The plan for the Tenderizer was not originally in the Meat Weak drops pool.
---
To answer your question on how to get the mods is yes the only way to get them is by scrapping them
---
Launch a Nuke on Whitesprings
---
Sorry can’t help you since I’m on PS4 but I agree....those highly radiated fluids are real hard to come by :(
---
I get mine from doing scorched earth
---
Sure sure.  That makes sense.
---
Yea lol
---
The community is so nice because were not out here to fight against one another, we are out fighting the game - be it the harsh wasteland or the harsh(er) servers and bethesda shenanigans.  
---
Why kill you when I am already overencumbered? Why destroy your camp when I get a bounty on my hand and others try to kill me (and steal my junk).  
---
And most important: why grieve someone that can help you with events? It's not like I get something for one person shooting less on the SBQ (provided he doesnt use a magic like a drooling idiot (yeah, we get it; heavy goes bra-tata and sbq is dead, maybe stop shooting a little while before))
---
You'll miss your chance to pick the lock but the loot is individual as with any container. It is a thing to break those hype shooting the drone to get a certain end game item and that will break the cargo drop for you, but they would have to be there the moment it's dropping.
---
Yeah, good call. Hadn't actually thought about that. 🤦‍♂️
---
You have answers from 3 different people that you're ignoring. You don't seem to value the time of others. Imagine we might just end up at:
---
&gt; Too each their own
---
Hey that reminds me of something... Is that why I get booted rather quickly when I join someone's private world?
---
Wtf is FSP? Trying to figure it out but SBQ and Scorched Earth... Death From Above...
---
I get the other abbreviations, I know what you're referring to, still no clue.
---
Edit: Got it! Fissure Site Prime?
---
I refuse to use this over SBQ. :|
---
It wasn't used very much. They took out luck and put in daily ops bonus xp.
---
Yes. Tell me, have you ever seen a weapon in a trade menu or vendor named? And sometimes it glitches and you can see the the name for like 1/10 of a second and then it goes away, proving it
---
Where did you launch the nukes
---
well yeah. That's obvious.
---
Another issue is good headsets , if you have a high end headset nobody can hear you but a 10$ no name brand works flawlessly. It’s ridiculous
---
Fissure site prime lol
---
Depending on what you have i have some to trade
---
Interestingly enough, If you get in there when there is no event all nodes will be collectible.
---
They didn't change it, the person is referring to the 3 hour wait after silo A is used before it can be used again
---
Monohgah mines CP event sorry forgot to mention where I launched
---
Sometimes you find unmineable ultracite in nuke zones that was transformed from normal ore, have a mess around with it.
---
How about just making a text box where we can type and search what we want. Super easy to implement, can be totally client sided and server would still only check whether you can build something or not.
---
A simple text area can be literally added on the main scrap/transfer menu. I have magazine full of racks and i literally have to spend 5-10 seconds to pass all the displayed items to get to the ones i want.
---
A text box right under the categories, where i could type for ex: "Water" and both in my inventory and stash (or the other container) would only show purified, boiled, and dirty water
---
I feel like hacked ones rarely appear on console no?
---
So are those the guns people use when the scorchbeast queen and such are merked in a few seconds?
---
*imagine crying about this when pacifist mode exist for this very reason* 😂
---
If you are in a team, then one of them needs to be in first, then the whole team gets first preference when loading the mine. So if you have 2 teams of 4 ready to do ACP, get one person from each team in there first and you'll have 8 buddies there.
---
You mean update?
---
Finished it 2 days ago. Got to 98 and could not be fucked anymore. Bought the last 2 levels with  atoms. Pretty burnt out after playing for almost 2 months on a daily basis. Probs wont play again for a while and won't do it again.
---
Takes up too much time, rewards were cool but in the end I feel arent worth the effort. 100% worse off for losing the atom challenges.
---
Ok cool
---
I think I misread OP then, apologies . But what is OP meaning by doing everything till the last point? I thought you couldn’t enter a silo during the reconstruction of the missile? Or does it let you in early? I’m so lost :-(
---
EDIT I think I know what he’s talking about , I didn’t actually know there was a timer for the player to use that same silo afterwards , I just change servers and repeat
---
Yes, thank you. I usually leave my ps4 in rest mode to update, whenever i check back the next day the updates progress has completely wiped
---
One day you’ll be a high level dude bouncing around and one shotting things, you’ll come across some noobo wearing wood gear and it will be your time to return the favour :)
---
I was having to do mine and my husbands every day since i started cause he couldnt and i ended up buying the last 10 levels 3 weeks ago. Feels nice not having to play fo76 right now.
---
You're going to need a new build for the ops, stealth is dead there.
---
Likely because you didn’t dupe anything.
---
You'll get there
---
Yea. If no one can see you on their friend list it’ll assume you’re not really friends and boot you.
---
Only time I really used it was during fasnacht where I moved my camp so I could shell the bonfire.
---
I tend to play deep pocketed and stealth so far I'm running leather since it's low maintenance.
---
I’d say yes it’s good still has a few game breaking bugs tho so unless ur unlucky then I’d say go for it and play
---
I stayed away for a long time due to bad reviews. I finally tried it for free on Game Pass a little over a month ago and I’m level 135 and haven’t put the game down since. I love everything about it.
---
But I would love to see R34 *death claw fantasies*
---
Then make a better build. I can do 2/3rds of the required damage.
---
Yea just plug cord out of your Xbox
---
The way the instancing works you mostly get 4-5 people on average in each instance. So if you're not in a group or grouped with low levels you won't get placed with higher people who are grouped. Same with joining late, unless you join on a team mate and not on the event icon.
---
You mean pull cord out then put it back in?
---
&gt; Simp
---
He said, "Go play a game where trash talk is welcome."
---
Also, what sort of lame insult is "Simp" anyway? It's a word lonely incel teenagers use. That's really the best you could come up with?
---
The main story yes, but its still super glitchy.
---
Son.  
---
Of.  
---
A.  
---
Bitch.
---
Well, from my perspective:
---
I've done the event at least 15-20 times so far and have collected all the plans with two characters. It was really fun - don't get me wrong. But my lead and steel have really taken a hit. So, now I am taking a break from that event so that I can farm resources. Also, because I have all the plans, I do not feel compelled to join in.
---
However, I do always show up for SBQ since she is not as much of a bullet sponge and is actually pretty easy in comparison. 
---
I am not sure about other people's perspectives.
---
Beyond suppressed as other have said, make sure you have your Pip-Boy light off. It actually affects sneak.
---
So my JE+P Lever Action should still do the job?
---
Yea should see a big green Xbox logo when you turn your Xbox back on
---
Ok good cause yesterday i...MAY have been really bored and tired and bought it without thinking lmao. Its not usually like me to do stupid things like that. Anyway i just wanted to make sure i didnt waste oh....80 dollars on the deluxe editon for fallout 76
---
Lol!
---
My automatic bloodied handmade does around 320 damage per shot and it doesn’t seem to even touch him. Not sure how to increase that. Have any tips? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Make sure you’re carrying a fan!
---
This is the answer. You craft four pieces and they are not good, but you are forced to keep them or drop them (therefore, destroy them) because you have used your 150 of the day. 
---
I rarely craft really. Can't stand the system. It's more fun to visit vending machines and buy those great pieces which have gone cheap because of SS armor.
---
Huh. When i first played it on ps4 (i have it on pc now cause i was an idiot last night and bought it impulsively) it had a bit of story but not really much. The gameplay was pretty bland too edit: relax guys. Last time i played 76 was a couple weeks after launch. Before any dlc or shit like that. Im just talking about my experiences then. I have no clue what the game is like now. Hence my post. Also im not saying im an idiot for buying 76. Im saying im an idiot for not thinking it through first. For all i know 76 could still be trash and i just wasted 80 dollars. But i DONT KNOW THAT. which is why im asking this question. Im not saying anything good or bad about modern 76.
---
Next time you are launching a nuke for the ACP event throw up a message on Xbox LFG (bottom of People section). Make sure you are listed as online so players can join your server.
---
Much better than the lvl 134 who killed the Wendigo before any of us can get a hit in. Spent the whole time playing music not caring about the ghouls but hoped to at least get a hit in lol
---
Find a corner and slowly move it to the wall you want. It works
---
That’s an interesting idea.
---
I'm pretty sure areas still have a max level limit. Like ash heap is maxed at 50
---
If you are gunna be on in like 6 hours from now (2am CDT) I got some flux to trade. Gamer tag is Deanbag97
---
My camp is about 100yards from a blood eagle compound. I surprise them every now and then with a barrage.
---
I'm seeing a lot of low alts being leveled up (you can tell by the outfits they're wearing), myself included. After finishing the legendary run and doing the new event about a dozen times, there's nothing else I would like to do. I've geared up my other toons so I can run the next seasons with them.
---
I do, the problem isn't with signing into the XBox, it's signing into the game itself
---
Yeah the assaultron wasn't the boss you're right but i couldnt get pass it to even reach the sentrybot boss at the end lol
---
So this answer the question to why once one teammate was outside the map in the Pharma lab and why he didn't die (because I die like in less than 30 seconds.) Got the message *player found a nuclear briefcase case* and about 2 minutes later he launched a nuke.
---
Maybe I'll try it some day, want to launch a nuke, I have got 4 nuke codes like 7 times but I've never found a nuke brief case. :(
---
I clearly have by now tho
---
What's that even used for?
---
Would be nice if names stayed. You could change it later if you wanted
---
It took 6 months to get Earle. Even though new things are nice, it's not possible every update because of bugs and delays.
---
I truly dont understand where the *difficulty* is in fighting earle. I've done it with a group of three to five generally--no low levels though. Never failed it in a dozen or so runs, and died once to the fall down the shaft only lol (embarrassing first timer moment....) 
---
Earle is a bitch and his children hit like pansies. My only challenge is the RNG which hasn't given me any furnishing type items yet.
---
I turn up to every PS4 launch I see hands down. Love the XP and shit. Prefer SBQ tbh. Old and true.
---
I have destroyed probably 20 vanguard pieces. We should be able to trade with them to people with the plans.
---
It's the best magic weapon, it doesn't proc 100% of the time like a minigun will so you won't instakill a boss and ruin everyones time but you can solo SBQ or Earle with no problem. Magic weapons don't need to be 200 fire rate, even 50. cals are magic, it just procs more on them. As for mods just get the prime receiver and scrap some until you get a hipfire barrel and the focuser.
---
The way to check is find a terminal and load the missile silo holotape into it and it lists all the cooldowns
---
Yes. If you find armor with "15% damage reduction while standing still" it automatically makes applicable weapons OP for some reason. If you find something like "50% limb damage" or "Extra Bash Damage" those are also special modifiers. Best used on weapons with high fire-rate and a good frame-rate. Focus on a specific body part till it pops. You'll see this mostly on gatlings and such, but this also applies to shotguns in VATS. Headshots with indiscernable yellow numbers popping heads.
---
Unless you create a new character. New characters canonically haven't left the vault and a year has past since reclamation day. All the in vault robots state as much, as well as certain interactions after leaving the vault.
---
Did you test it yet fully to make sure it works? 🤣
---
I know this will fix it
---
Just my luck honestly I’ve tried to make sure just like SBQ I look for enuf players on server but I guess it’s not really the same as scorched earth , I have like 300 repair kits from it if that says anything but maybe I’ll get lucky to join a CP event soon
---
I do Bloodied Unyielding, with an emphasis on AP refresh speed.
---
Treasure hunters plan was from the mole miners pales. Haven't seen it back yet. Has a hat to go with it. 50caps is a really good price they where selling for Heaps more
---
Really destroys the whole “Fallout with friends” experience doesn’t it?
---
Go to a terminal in the world, any will do put the holotape into it and check then run the appropriate silo
---
Lol, good post, have a good day mate.
---
Stack adrenaline (if it’s max level, wipe out the Wendingo spawns, and you’ll have 60 seconds of an additional 60% damage), if you have the Sneak 3 perk, replace it for Escape Artist and instead put the perks into the perk that increases ranged Sneak damage, if you’re a heavy VATS user then you want to get the Better Criticals perk (that is a real game changer), and carnivore plus cooked Scorchbeast meat makes you significantly tankier by restoring 400 HP. If you have strange in numbers and you’re in a public team, 500. There’s also a small area to the right that has Hornwright crates. Stand on them and blast away, making sure you keep the spawns away. Earle can’t melee you there and he can’t spawn hazards there either. He stands there and takes it like a dumbass. Psychobuff is a hell of a drug, and the Karma Syringer works on Earle. He has a natural 80% damage reduction. That’s how I do it.
---
Alternatively you can watch AngryTurtle. He might play as a PC dude but he has some real good advice.
---
I’m always online so ppl can join on me I’ll take a shot at it ty for the suggestion
---
I have no clue what "proc" means.  But I've been using this weapons for several weeks.  I go to every ACP and SBQ and have never had any unexpected/extra damage.
---
Feel your pain. I did the legendary race on two accounts and just about lost my mind. Was so happy when the second account claimed level 100 haha.
---
Yeah, for the most part.
---
It's still got plenty of issues but its alot better now yea.
---
Exactly, the nerf is negated by the legendary perk Ammo Factory anyway. An extra bullet doesn't matter when you're making 2.5x more ammo.
---
Stealth VATS crit sniper here. As you enter the battle to the left close to the corner is a piece of excavation equipment with a bucket for moving dirt. It is an excellent hiding space with vantages of almost the entire area.
---
I crouch in there shooting wendigos with my bloodied lever, once adrenalin is charged I shoot at Earl doing around 400 damage per shot. Occasionally I draw the attention of a wendigo swarm but very rarely do I die to them. 
---
I definitely do more than my fair share in the event and it is great when I see a teammate start to get over run only to have me kill everything chasing them down. 
---
I have yet to fail in this event while using this strategy.
---
My favorite armor solar I have some pretty good ones but it takes so long to get one you want to keep and it takes so long to build up all of the stuff you need and you can’t even put the jet pack on it whitch would be great if you could attach it to all armor but still it’s my favorite I love the look and the effects
---
Why are we not funding this?!?
---
Seriously though, for a Halloween getup or April fools day prank this would make it rather popular.
---
Appreciate it, BBC.
---
You said it. I always thought it was a setting either in fo76 or my ps4 itself that was hiding my online presence.
---
Gutted to find out its a problem with the game that probably will never be fixed.
---
You can use explosive bait
---
Been like that since Wastelanders released. Also to get to the lower floors you now have to pick the locks on TWO doors that you didn't have to before,  and they also closed of some of the dorms that were previously open. I used to get tech docs there &amp; the weights for lead &amp; steel. I don't bother going there anymore.
---
I always share Strange in Numbers because I'd say the vast majority of players aew mutated
---
I prefer combat or scout armor, i’m currently swapping my vanguard pieces for 15%, but I always keep one piece of auto stim and lifesaving.
---
I will jump for joy when I'm done grinding out my boyfriend's legendary run. And cry a bit, probably. LOL
---
Have 2 300 lvl characters I’d just like to have ppl join event if I’m launching a nuke and lets be honest after launching a nuke 3-400 times it’s really really dull and having no accomplishment after makes it worse
---
Will have to catch you some other time. Will be dead asleep at that time..lol
---
Whenever it dose this open another game than close it and then open fallout76 again. That worked for me
---
If you’re asking if it will still kill stuff, the answer is yes. If you are asking if it will still one shot most mobs, the answer is no. You will see a significant decrease in damage. It’s still one of the best rifles, but no longer in a top tier build. The damage nerf combined with increasing level caps with one wasteland means it’s going to take more bullets to kill everything. That’s why automatic rifles won’t see as much impact.
---
Rifleman depends on massive single shot damage to kill enemies quickly before having to chamber your next round or reload after less than ten rounds. Commando is more dependent on sustained damage over time, not needing the highest damage per shot.
---
If you didn’t know the specifics they changed damage from multiplicative or additive meaning that stacking % buffs no longer takes into account the damage gained from your other buffs. On live if a rifle does 100 damage and you run rank one of each rifleman, expert , and master your total damage is 133. This is because each added buff takes the other 10% increases into account (10% or 100 is 10, but 10% of 110 is 11). On the PTS you get only 10% of the weapons base damage, meaning a rifle that does 100 damage with rank one of each rifleman card will only do 130 damage.
---
Squad maneuvers on a 6 charisma toon is what I run. My medics builds I share either field surgeon, friendly fire, sunpower and lucky draw. Sun power is good for the added strength to big guns players, friendly fire for regen heals with my flamer, it’s great for the radiation rumble for survivors and for project paradise keeping the friendly pet alive.
---
I do 69 for 1* , 666 for 2* , and 1337 for 3* no matter what it is.
---
PvP isn’t the only point of workshops.
---
Almost every other player feels you dude
---
Yes because after I put it on and was jumping to different vendors I saw another for 1000 and I bought that one too and I didn’t know that I have one of those pails left the better of the three I’ll open it and roll the dice thanks for the info
---
That was awesome 😆
---
Bunker, from the modus armoury vendor
---
not bad idea wise but you know the core actually there to give energy to the generator lol not other  way around :D
---
That I understand making ammo is a chore just didn’t realize CP would die out that fast just a lil disappointed atm . Ty for the reply
---
I always assumed the core was more of a backup power since they still seem to run when you take them out. Thought it might charge them, especially since the power plants produce them...though, being attached to a power plant is totally what's charging those cores.
---
This, someone make Bethesda listen to their community! That would improve this game so much.
---
They have a 100%. Everything in that area has a 100% spawn rate. Only briefcase location within the building varies
---
Yeah, been there mate, that's why I put it down for a bit. Look on the groups as someone suggested, surely a couple of buddies will join you.
---
It has a lot to offer if you like to collect. The story can certainly drag once you hit the Savage divide and it gets bad in the Mire, but once past that the game opens up a lot with the new content. Once the map is explored and you have gotten up to level 50 you begin to settle into your final builds with the game.   
---
Playing solo is not that bad and once you learn how things work it can be pretty easy at times. (Vital beginner info: Using a workbench uses items in your stash box, so if you are repairing or making something you do not need to keep items on you. Scrap extra weapons and armor you do not use to unlock mods for them. Plants and meat spoil over time, old world foods will not spoil but provide no buffs like food you cook yourself.)  
---
Playing with a public team can be hit or miss, if you get someone willing to help you out, there are a lot of things they can do to assist you, from giving you supplies, to giving passive buffs that boost your exp gain. For the most part high level players do not harass low level players, if you see one coming to you just wave hello, do not attack them and most will either wave hi and leave, but others will help. I know when I created a new character to do some events I had a level +200 come up to me and offer me a gun. He gave helpful information if I had been new, letting me know how pipe revolvers gain bonuses from perk cards for revolvers, and if you give it a stock to make it a rifle, it also gains damage buffs from the rifle perk cards. This is the kind of community 76 has, people are mostly indifferent or nice. Sure you might get unlucky and run into a person who is a dick, but they are fairly rare these days.
---
Same here.  No plans to interact with the next one.  The daily log ins are just too much.
---
Will do ty bud appreciate you.
---
Can't help, PS4
---
But can help. Nuke the Whitespring with a buddy on server. Start at the gold club, kill all ghouls and circle around the nuke zone killing them all and collecting their drops. Then either you or your friend leave the server and sign back in. This will usually respawn all the ghouls, whom you can kill again and again for more and more mats and scrap. Then, when you feel as though you have enough, go farming for raw flux
---
While you’re waiting for the Karma to make him weak, that’s while you shred the spawns.
---
1.) Dailies were SOOO easy ... 1hr tops
---
2) Create a new character... levels easy 
---
3.) I like this idea 
---
4.) I like the Skins, just wish we could get some for other types of guns ... FIXER!!
---
5.) it would be nice if they went back to **Atoms** once the SCORE run was finished
---
No longer available.
---
Fair enough, I play at hoodrat hours. I will add you so if you are still looking lmk
---
It would also be nice if when you hit that final level there was some sort of acknowledgement or too-doo about it. Otherwise it just feels like an empty sacrifice of time, effort, and resources. Sure we get the rewards but an atta boy/girl would be nice considering how much flak I’ve put up with from my wife and daughter demanding what ever this “quality time” thing is and whatever something something “responsibilities” they keep yammering on and on and on about are.
---
This is a really complicated question, ya know? On top of nothing being finalized until these changes reach live it also will hugely boil down to various break points when it finally does. We simply can not tell you if your weapon will have any real value until then.
---
For instance there might be a situation where two shots from your weapon are needed to kill an enemy because you deal 99% of their hp with your first shot. A handmade might also kill that same enemy by dealing 50% with each hit. At that point is your lever action still viable to you? What if your weapon two shots an enemy a handmade takes six shots to kill?
---
We just do not know where the meta will fall. People are, rightfully, quite upset about these changes and there is reason to think what we see on the PTS will not be the final numbers. Just chill, my dude. Meta takes a long time to emerge and planning for what people see on the PTS is a bit silly.
---
This would work well as a gunslinger or riflemen type but it would probably work with any type weapons. 
---
I had a gunslinger revolver crit type build which was a lot of fun to play with the right legendaries.
---
Bless you Bethesda!
---
Effects that have a chance of triggering are said to proc when they trigger
---
Very nice
---
Three rounds of ammo, one at a time.
---
Didn't work
---
Ooo didn’t think about those perks to use during those events, pretty clever
---
Im glad you decided to take the photos, need to put them in a comic like strip with the comments you made over top.
---
&gt;Never really got why everyone made such a big deal about it, or the previous lack of them.
---
I guess because it took something away from the games without adding anything in it's place.
---
I agree that the range is ridiculous, but it was done so the griefers wont use it to destroy camps. Now we cant even damage workshop items, so its range could be doubled or even tripled or quadrupled. Id say about 15 caps fast travel distance, maybe 20, as long as they dont damage other players.
---
I use mine just to scare people who contest my fully built workshop. I hate PvP in this game and I dont lock resources that Im not farming for, and I allow anyone to walk in and take and resources, and even give it to the (especially low level) other players. But the number of annoying selfish players in the recent month made me kill a lot of player.
---
Please say you’re on Xbox.
---
Y and ps4 🤬
---
Shit so I missed it. Well that sucks would have been sweet to get the beret since all im interested in was the Beret and fatigues so now I just need to grab the fatigues. I hope they add BoS clothes for sale including a different beret to the Atom Shop. Thanks for telling me though.
---
FUCK! I wanted to fight you.
---
Maybe unplug the power source of your machine and back in?
---
Thanks I knew there were probably some there. I've only been there maybe 2 times out of thousands of matches.
---
I share Radicool. We all like getting stronger.
---
But now that teams are hot and Earl is there, I might start sharing the one in which your stimpacks heal everyone.
---
Did already
---
Not all players have an open character slot for cheesing the level up daily. Most players I know use all of their character slots for either different builds or storage mules.
---
https://youtu.be/pfnnujU1DUk
---
I would say a good idea is if you see high levels on the server, double check to see if they are active. I have used your same method for doing Encrypted and had no one show up since I later discovered the high level players were all sitting AFK in their camps.
---
*laughs in dataminer*
---
I actually didn’t know.   So NOW everyone knows
---
Dang. I’m out of ideas GL
---
Are you saying there is a briefcase 100% of the time somewhere in the Pioneer camp?
---
Plus it's one of the few that stack!
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks, I'll try it!
---
lvl 100 in just 3 weeks?  
---
IDK but it seems you are kinda of rushing. Ive played about 6-8 months, about 900+ hours and Im lvl 222  
---
And I left VATs as soon as realized how unreliable it is and only occasionally use it in PA with increased VATs chance.
---
It sucks but it's surprising how rare vultures like that are to be fair, I've only had it happen once when I was low level. They even went all out using a stealth boy whilst I was repairing my armor. There's more cool people than chodes like that though. Always stash your junk is the best lesson.
---
PvP zone. Shoulda stashed. 
---
If it's a public server you go into it without anything on you that you don't wanna lose.
---
Even for the SCORE daily I treat it like I'm a glowing target while I build 10x plushies to get my challenge done.....
---
Funny because I'm  friends with the people who were running that!
---
Everyone but those who doesn't read reddit or noobs.
---
This has been posted.
---
High luck means you should focus on vats.
---
5 points go into the mutant perks, 3 go into bloody mess, 3 into serendipity, the other 3 could be Tormentor (rifleman), One Man Army (heavy gunner) or something else.
---
A Bloodied Unyielding build with 30 luck or more means lots of critical hits, all the time.
---
I want them restore the feature that extra durability provides extra damage/armor.
---
Well, as you can see, I haven’t been on reddit for very long, so I do appreciate knowing that’s a bug and not just my flamer being shitty.     Shittier, I should say, since they’re hopelessly broken in other ways as well
---
Tactical or armor? If you're on pc I can give you one. You can usually buy the plan for the armor one from a dupers camp and sometimes they don't rip you off too much too.
---
Understandable... we all make our own choices 👍🏼
---
Marine Helmet or Marine Tactical Helmet? The Marine Helmet plan was only obtainable from treasure hunter mole miners but some people, myself included, would be happy to make it for you. If its the tactical one, you can still find those plans in harpers ferry sometimes.
---
I’m working on sentinel solar scout armor and let me tell you it’s a long lonely road I have 3 unyielding pieces 1 sentinel piece 2 more that have the assassins effect I’ve dropped or scraped more so many
---
Notice how the lights go out when you take one out, and the generator stops humming if im not mistaken, especially in FO4. So strange that It didnt even cross my mind that cores would be charged actually or be back up. I get your point of view tho.
---
Directly from the Fandom  
---
" The fusion generator is a fusion powered electric generator that uses a fusion core to produce electricity.  "
---
I have been trying to get mfs to grind this event with me for ages.   It’s so rare than anyone else shows up
---
Really? I didn’t think it would stack, that’s pretty sick
---
So why should I have to grind two to three times as long as someone who is able to cheese the system and essentially exploit their way to an easy daily completion.
---
Depending on what other folks are sharing (to avoid duplicates), I’ll usually share one of strange in numbers, travel agent, inspirational, or scrapper. If there are very low level folks, I’ll sometimes share aqua-girl instead.
---
Do you also really think we would realistically walk 240 miles in a day?
---
I had the opportunity to play with friends before the semester began. Running events and  SBQ etc. The levels went quickly as I got a feel for the game. Also, I think unreliable is an understatement. I went with a gun sling character. I that's what I always liked in FO3, FONV, and FO4, little did I know about VATS issues. Now I'm leveling to respec to a shotgun build, oh well lessons learned!
---
They couldn’t even get the power counter to function correctly in 76.    I’m with you, though.
---
You should swing by my trap camp if you get a ps4 and then we can fight 👌
---
If you’re on Xbox, you can use the LFG tool to post a “project paradise on me” post, and it often brings help.
---
It wasn't that bad at launch. I enjoyed it much more than games of a similar type like division 2 and anthem. Wastelanders did make it what i wanted more or less as well.
---
It did, there were robots and tapes that moved quests along pretty much exactly like NPCs but with less jabber.    
---
Like how are the NPCs different than the robots?  They give you the exact same quests repeat the exact same lines... They just look like people instead of robots.    
---
If beth NPCs had been good in other games I could understand, but they weren't.  They are all just quest bags with limited interactivity.
---
Unyielding Marine, full set. Marine is balanced, you get the best of all worlds, and I look like a lightweight, agile Power Armor.
---
That was a FB group that I am in the Auction. The FB page is Wasteland Rouge Traders and we have Auctions that bids are only in junk. I am so happy that you had a pleasant experience and we welcome you anytime
---
*curses* So many pieces I could've used. It's a real shame...
---
“Would you like to scrap this lvl 50 ultracite torso.          
---
You will get 1 steel and 2 plastic”
---
&gt; Leveling up should be a repeatable challenge and the 10,000 XP challenge should be a daily. When you're low level gaining levels is easy but for us higher level players it takes all damn day to gain a level even when boosting XP. 
---
You are doing something seriously wrong. If I am boosting I get 2-3 levels in an hour of serious play. More if I get a glitched line in the sand. 134 , 4 weeks ago 268 now on my main my alts have fared well also. Oh it was slow as hell, until I found a pattern and used all the xp buffs minus the bobblehead but using the magazine unless I plan to do ACP in which I pop a tesla 5 for the ammo on heavies.   
---
Having the 10k repeatable is what saved my ass and allowed me to finish a full week ahead of schedule and I was 6 spaces behind the ship. Glitched line in the sand popped every xp plus lunch boxes netted me 7000-7500 per wave, 20 waves per event got me up so fast and I only had to spend 3 hours harming it.   
---
As a FO 1st person myself I could see greater outcries if we were to get a bonus, maybe post 100 bonuses but not SCORE.   
---
Point 5 I fall back to for the first members. But to make it fairer let the non payers accure atoms through the old challenges.
---
It took a lot of my energy to level up to 57 on my character after I got wiped to make a near perfect PvP build for my play style. I don’t think I could do that again then acquire PvP gear on PS4, especially since I don’t know anyone on PlayStation side who owes/owed me any favours. Even after calling in all my favours on Xbox, I still don’t have a set of ass/sent armor.
---
Thank you for the tip.
---
Uh you can still scrap the chassis
---
I find everyone crowds the radstags, leaving the easy to solo gather molerats free. It works most of the time for getting both through.
---
Np, good luck!
---
https://youtu.be/PFL46PhIGHc here is a link to one of a few Auctions on You Tube
---
Well, I would suggest that it’s using the system and how it is setup to my advantage.... seeing as the challenges are across the account... not the character. It is not even close to being an “exploit”.... lol
---
I choose to leave a blank character... no Legendary items, no caps...  easily to delete and start up again ... helps me and my friends with Cap/item transfers.
---
&gt;  I also wonder if I'd log in and play at all if the limits weren't there? 
---
Those limits are exactly why I don't play much.  The amount of times I've hit my scrip limit after playing for a grand total of 10 minutes is absurd.  
---
I honestly don't know why people cling to the idea that daily limits are required to keep people coming back.  Pretty much every ARPG/Looter Shooter ***except*** Fallout 76 has no need of artificial roadblocks like this and yet they still have higher playerbases.
---
Always was, my dude.
---
The armor helmet and im on pc, but I dont have many caps at the moment
---
Lmfao that’s why you trade and dont freeload
---
He bought the outfit, 50c is ok
---
The hotel trailer next to the wayward is great for this
---
Leave and return later, when the event is over.
---
If I see you crouching I will immediately assume you are after my candy, and try to kill you.
---
similar thing happened to me but it was at an armour workbench
---
Don't sell flux cheaper than 250.  People buy that all day long
---
Honestly I'd be happy if depending on your nuke location you'd get a 100% 3* cryptid spawn, like if you nuke the toxic valley a 3* grafton monster would spawn as the boss or if you nuke in Charleston a 3* snallygaster would spawn nothing huge like colossal problem just a few bosses to add some diversity
---
Stash your junk. Whether you’re in a workshop, about to go into a workshop, chilling in your camp and stepping away to take a leak, or you just stashed your junk. ***Stash it again***. 
---
You need to become like Pavlov’s dog. You see a stash/scrap box, you walk over and dump your junk.  It needs to be a muscle memory. 
---
Wife just told you she’s pregnant, but you see a stash box on the screen?  Stash your junk, then celebrate!  Celebrate the fact that you stashed your junk, and then *celebrate the fact that you stashed your junk.*
---
You rock! What I want is the bear arm plan!
---
PvP grounds. Lesson learned.
---
If your fighting Earle, the perk where your gun randomly repairs itself is amazing.  Gun breakage is a major issue in that fight.
---
Vitor brum?
---
The damage calculator change is a first step to balance certain weapons and legendaries since they mention it will be so much easier to oversee and balance the damage buffs and perks. 
---
Unless they came out with a final patch note, things in PTS are bound to be changed. It does take time and some planning to add a new storyline to the game and it’s not even been 6 months after wastelanders so I wouldn’t rush for a brand new storyline, I’d rather have them fix bugs.
---
But I do agree with you, I love fallout because of its lore. But you have to understand we might be facing a smaller dev team than fallout 4 from the looks of all the patches and bugs, so things might be coming out slower.
---
You can't do enough damage in 45 seconds to loot?
---
What's your IGN, I can hop on to give you a couple for free.
---
I spent a thousand hours trading, and helping people out. I’m not a freeloader. The people that armed me after I got wiped were the people I’d helped most.
---
True, I have noticed that, just not sure if I can sacrifice any luck perks for it. But still a good idea
---
Also this is the link to our page and the huge giveaway we are doing https://m.facebook.com/groups/2414206815539102?view=permalink&amp;id=2459024284390688

I have a 3*, get this...
---
* 40% faster swing rate
---
* 90% reduced weight
---
....and it's a mutant slayers prefix 😭
---
You missed Meat Week, my dude.
---
Now do this with the giddyup buttercup ride and you can have an invisible noble steed
---
And stay crouched so they can’t see you on the map
---
If on console, we now have 'A Colossal Problem' event.
---
This didn’t answer the question as to why some of the people who are most dedicated to the game are the ones punished by having to actually do the work to complete their dailies.
---
And I would most definitely consider scrapping a new character every day a way of exploiting their mechanics. Bethesda clearly didn’t mean for this to happen based on the other dailies, also, if this was intended as a “feature” we’re back to the question again of why Bethesda now intentionally punished some of the players who play the game the most.
---
Ther is a logging camp north of the new BOS place that will get you that wood back
---
Now this is the stuff I suspect from this subreddit thanks for the information
---
Freedom never felt so good. Too bad the next season is just right around the corner.
---
I know mutants doesnt show in the items stats, its added afterward. I know from a mistake with starched genes. It still hurts to think about.
---
That’s tough
---
I wonder if you could get a friend to shoot you with energy guns to charge your cores or if using energy grenades on yourself would work.
---
"proc" is old school lingo, meaning a procedure that has a chance of triggering, usually a  weapon effect
---
It just works.
---
It's Finn199, Im level 71
---
No need to be a drama queen lmao, I honestly had no idea of pacifist mode considering I’m not playing it that long and had never encountered any hostile players till now 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I have some stable cobalt flux that you can have
---
that makes me saad
---
T I fucking L. I never share it because it  seems to be the most shared card and had no idea it stacked.
---
I added another for you!
---
Nah, I used to use it all the time. It doesn't just hit the exact spot you popped smoke on. It'll hit in a radius around that marker as well. If the enemies you're after are in an enclosed area, like a base of some kind, or if they're attacking something specific, they tend not to move much. (Until the artillery starts coming in, in which case they'll try to find the owner and kill them.)
---
It isn't extremely useful at higher levels, but it's still fun. And it can help a lower-level take an area that they might not otherwise be geared for.
---
What you can do is open your pipboy, go to the event tab and click "Leave quest". So you are no longer in the event.
---
Hope this helps. Have a good day.
---
I love the fact that there is a weapons workbench right next to where you spawn after dying in that event.
---
Believe it’s happening quite a bit. You are one of many, including myself, that has had this issue. 120... lucky... 1133 plans. 850 5 cap mounted heads plans, low price power armor pieces, high priced colossus plushies.
---
I just sell the you have been insulted notes for max caps
---
My weaponry is perfect, and most of it mine anyway (it was loaned out because I didn’t want it at the time, I went off PvP and went rifleman for ammo efficiency and made a melee character for boss killing). My build is amazing, and I can thank my friends for helping me make it. My armor was also mine anyway, also on loan until the girl I lent it to turned herself up a better set. She’s now using Uny/sent scout armor while I have 2* Uny heavy combat armor. So I’m better equipped than most people in the Wasteland, but I’m not equipped as well as the gods of the wastes yet. Nor do I have their skill. I still need a Tesla rifle and ass/sent armor. I’m thinking of biting the bullet and spending ~£50 to finish off my gear and aid stockpile.
---
It would be nice for PC players to not have a console or gamepad-oriented menu, but I'm aware that ain't happening.
---
Oh god you poor thing, with how bugged plans are and they don't stack correctly in your Stash it must have taken you a long ass time to fix that.
---
AGREED! Until the alcohol makes you think taking on a legendary scorch beast solo is a great idea at lvl 29 lol
---
Damn never considered that
---
It used to work if you aim, quickly vats and shoot, never tried again in a long time
---
Nuke Morgantown for high rad fluids. Drop just north of Mama Dolce's so you get part of the airport. I can get 25-30 HRF easy plus plenty of cobalt flux.
---
I can still play. Sorry went to run an errand. You still on? Message me if today still works!
---
The range is a tiny little ring, too far one way you're too close, too much the other it's too far. Bafflingly it can't even fire into a nuke zone so I've never seen anyone be able to use it on the SBQ!
---
Should add: The chem from "Brawling Chemist" is called the Super Chem Mk I, and it gives +3 STR, +25% Damage Resist, and +20% melee damage for five minutes. The chem from "Survival Shortcut" cures all diseases and completely restores your health, hunger, and thirst.
---
Thank you so much for putting this guide together. I did have a quick question:
---
As I understand it, you get the level 1 legendary perks for free. Are you able to swap the level 1 perks out for something else later on? For example, lets say I start out with a non-PA build. However, after awhile I decide that I want to use PA and get the PA legendary cards for it. What are my options at that point?
---
The only thing shared is slots and they’re not cumulative? Well that fucking sucks
---
Squad maneuvers won't do anything for anyone that already has the speed demon mutation, which is the majority of the population. Those people are already hitting the movement speed cap so another move speed bonus does nothing.
---
Hmm, I think I do remember that. Within the first few months they got nerfed to have bonuses apply spread among the pellets instead of to each pellet individually. And since then nobody has really used shotguns. Not sure if it was intended for them to get 8x bonuses from launch though
---
Have you seen my legs?
---
Speed demon isn’t needed if you got squad maneuvers add the fact speed demon makes you hungry and thirsty more often. I got rid of it and I swear by squad maneuvers over speed demon mutation. You do have a point tho that majority of the people run speed demon.
---
When I have power armor it doesn’t even show up as an option for scraping.
---
By main story, they mean The Wasterlanders Questline that came out earlier this year.
---
I don't think there is an in-game counter for your player, challenges just tick it down independently. So if they did add them, they would all start from 0 on all your characters. But yeah, the tech is already there, it would just require a bit of tweaking to have a stable place where it rises infinitely
---
I and my squad used shotguns a lot back then, alas my whole squad gave up on the game after the nerf, and I had to rework my build to rifles and later commando.
---
Bethesda, hire this man.
---
Carefully doing trades here. There are other pages for that. But just to let you know there is another chance coming up for Meat Week second helping.
---
All the bugs were miraculously fixed!! Not really but we should be getting another meat week at the end of September so you still have a chance
---
Running during your vats attacks does a power attack
---
This for me. I don't have a build, but suppose I will have to now. Swap perks and SPECIAL points and all that shit. I just want to play the game how I want to play.    WITHOUT POWER ARMOUR!!
---
Gotcha, thanks. Will post elsewhere!
---
I doubt that's possible. The SBQ is still somewhat bugged, but she spent over a year being like REALLY REALLY bugged. The ISS was only fixed a few months ago, too. The colossal problem fight is...still a long way from fully functional. Less than 3 fully functional fights over almost 2 years, and that's not counting all the time they had to perfect the SBQ before the game launched
---
Thats not a fallout issue. Its a ps4 issue for some reason.
---
I never had it until earlier this year or so. Now, 50% of the time game downloads/updates reset after being in rest mode.
---
So far it seems to me that if you pull it from rest mode before its done, it resets.

Don't want you to get in trouble thats all. GL in your search.
---
All right, so my memory was close. They've been trash for a long time, but not from *the* very beginning
---
Huh, I never knew that...been playing since beta.  Thanks, I'll give it a try tonight!
---
So if I have the lowest level of Master Infiltrator, does it work as an extra hacker or picklock card? Do they work together?
---
Exactly!  They knew what would be happening! I actually ran out of repair kits and had to intentionally die to get access to the bench.  I’ve been rocking the weapon repair card since then. 🤓
---
That sucks that that has been happening to you. 
---
I'm on ps4 and see a very busy ACP and even SBQ 9 out of 10 times.
---
The shotgun nerf occurred at the same time as the two shot, and explosive nerf.
---
Them 2 months later every weapon in the game got a 10% nerf that utterly crippled shotgun builds entirely.
---
I feel like after seeing the burnout from this one, many more people will just not care about the next one. I personally doubt I want to go through it all again for some more cosmetics. I remember the datamines showed that most of the stuff I want is a very early reward again just like with this one
---
Extra mules being used to stash your mains gear instead of FO 1st isn't cheesing in it own way?
---
It's the same shit. You're using a new toon to complete a goal.
---
My new main goal in game is to find a player breathing like a dying seal
---
Do you get something shotgun related from that?
---
Nice.
---
This, for sure. As a heavy I appreciate the non heavies putting the lead on the spawns.
---
Xbox? Can help restock reserves if needed.
---
 I’m not sure what you mean by “most dedicated”? I have almost 2K hours into the game... can still level up my main (L365) pretty easy in a game session ... especially with new “teams” and XP boosts. 
---
Don’t get me wrong... I have plenty of issues with Bethesda and the choices they’ve made ... and issues with the game ... I just don’t see it as “punishment”
---
I’ll just leave it at “agree to disagree” 😎✌🏽
---
I finally got Bear Arms plan from this, first time getting two animals alive. I always go to Project Paradise when it pops (PS4), just to try and entice more to join, works like half the time.     
---
     
---
For entering that code, does it start the event when you do that? Never heard of this before, sounds super helpful!
---
This is exactly the kind of vital information I came here for.   Take my upvote and my thanks.
---
Alot of people use the LFG tab. Usually takes about 10 minutes to get all the people I need.
---
It happened to me also I don’t know if I caused it didn’t do anything out of the ordinary and I just fixed the glitch that happens when you apply the future skin to your camp and I’ve gotten all the best answers and help from this site thanks guys
---
Where did I say the mule was storing junk items? Where did I say it was a completely new toon? In my experience it is very common for people to have alts that are upwards of level 10 to 15 that hold large amounts of weapons or armor that the player is not currently using. It is also common in my experience that players use these accounts to run shops or vendor characters with full camps dedicated to selling the players unused loot.
---
I want more gears and circuits as guaranteed drops off robot kills
---
Yeah its a bit depressing, last week or two most of the events has been empty
---
Sounds about right, for junk ones anyways.
---
You only need the first level of Master Infiltrator to open any level of lock/terminal. Later ranks only matter for the auto-unlock effect to skip the minigames.
---
Omg you nailed it.  That is exactly the cartoon reference that flashed in my mind when I read OPs post.   😂
---
Future being the operative word. They can barely meet their current schedule. Balancing will be a year or more out
---
I’m on Xbox but it’s ok maybe I’ll find an event soon but the experience has left me not wanting launch anymore nukes I’ll just have to wait to join in on one.
---
You got this!
---
It currently costs 1 Perk Coin to swap out any Legendary Perk, regardless of Rank or Level,
---
That number seems to be a placeholder though, and when finally released, it could cost more.
---
Added, thanks!
---
And obviously replying
---
More than once
---
It is effectively the same as having Hacker, Expert Hacker, Master Hacker, Picklock, Expert Picklock, and Master Picklock equipped. Plus you can auto-unlock Level 0 Locks/Computers.
---
The nuka cola fridge isn't a refrigerator. It acts as a punch bowl, meaning anyone that walks up to it can drink it's contents.
---
Your stuff isn't safe in the nuke cola machine.
---
The gauss explosion counts as a second hit, so your firerate is basically doubled. Putting the gauss minigun over the 200 fire rate for consistent magic damage, the FFR means you don't need a tri barrel so you don't need to sacrifice range which is descent.
---
Thats what someone did to me, i just started and the high lvl player gave me lots of plans, recepies, weapons, and gave me 5000 caps for a head start and told me the basics, bout play styles n such. Now im around lvl 76 and do my best to help out new lower lvl players I find. Been playing for 2 months now on ps4 btw. Fo76 has such a good supporting community n player base.
---
And just FYI, the new red communist atom shop paint lets you put a jetpack on the excavator power armor
---
Power armor for me
---
No prob. Buddy and I do this every couple months and just farm for ages. By the end, we're overencumbered with flux mats and ionized meats (I run carnivore and bloodied, so these are perfect for me when mixed with diluted rad-aways for rad management)
---
This is the thing. Everyone paid money to be able to have this game.  The great thing about this game is you can play however you choose to play it. Missions, exploring, pvp, etc.... I can take this thing down in under 1 min with my team. If me or my team drop the nuke and were farming xp, its gonna stay alive for a while, if we can help it. If we're farming plans for the group its going down in under 1 min. Regardless of who joins to the event. Fact is we did the work to drop the nuke. And other join without having to do anything. They will either get free xp and/or plan rewards. If someone else drops the nuke I'll join and wait to see if they can pull it down by them selves. You can normally tell if they are farming xp because they will hit it a couple of times then let it run around without paying attention to it, going after the normal wedigos. If not ill wait to see what they can do and finish it if it looks like the keep going down. Lol. Point is if you did the work and dropped the nuke finish it in 2 seconds if you want. Its not your obligation to wait so others that join on the event you spawned, get a hit......
---
If we reach the atlas goal for next week or maybe the week after (one of the 2)I believe we can earn another meat week
---
I wouldn’t have every mutation cuz at some point one mutation is gonna cancel another out or worse, just pick the right ones for you I highly suggest marsupial &amp; speed demon. 
---
Heard mentality is also great now that we have the public teams system in place
---
Having every mutation isn't bad per se, but some of them just don't help.
---
Ugh I was hoping this was the patch that food and water requirements were going away.
---
Oh ok. I meant before all of the dlc. Like, a couple weeks after launch
---
Don't need but still put it on there lol. I knew that shit was decent, 3rd one I ever made and if I remember correctly super duper proc'd on it and I made 2 of it, (if it can even proc on those kind of weapons, this was a long time ago I can't remember.) If only that shit was tradeable.
---
Your bad luck was my good luck. My first purveyor tenderizer was AA Swing Speed +1 Strength
---
They can't though, it lags the shit out of the game as weapons, armour, holotapes all take up a heap of data to exist. Where as junk is just an item id and a number to say how many of it there is 
---
If they added a junk bin that allowed 1000 Lbs of junk to be stored in it and make it a rusty version of the scrap box the game would run slower as people would be able to store more weapons ect in their stash box
---
If they took 400 Lbs off the stash box capacity to prevent that from happening the FO1st members would get mad
---
If they reclassified gunpowder as a junk item that can't be scrapped back to it's crafting components as a way to make that change less brutal people might go for it but I am doubtful
---
You start the event, then run to the door and enter that code. Go downstairs and you’ll see a room in the center of the sub level that has a terminal in it. Grab the shutdown code, run back to the starting terminal and shut it down. The good robot will take over the experiment and heal the animals between rounds.
---
So those cards are the first to go, eh? Good to know!
---
You wanna shoot us a nukadragon build so we can evaluate your perks?
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Great Post, Koodos on the setup and commentary.. the last Pic is awesome 😎👍🏼
---
Love the community in this game, hopefully the GTA players don’t find out about it.
---
What mutations do you have? With class freak, my stats don’t tank very much, but I’m sure removing some of them that you don’t have a use for will help you out. I actually need to scrub some of my own off of me
---
What's wrong with going to Harper's Ferry?
---
Ore? Theres ore? Shit how could I have been so blind?
---
I didn't even think we could go down in the tunnels I thought it was lethal radiation that would just kill me.
---
I was under the impression the scavengers were doing whatever needed to be done and we are just supposed to defend them...
---
😢
---
Thank you for explaining this 😎👍🏼
---
With class freak twisted muscles will still mess with your accuracy quite a bit, and you'll lose dps on the gauss mini from the grounded mutation. You shouldn't have problems with dps from your magic junkie minigun, but the numbers on screen won't represent it's actual dps.
---
What weapon do you use?
---
Yeah just did this and wow! Thanks for the help
---
The bot hasn’t had it for sale
---
It used to be that if you scrapped one you instantly learned to craft it. All you need is someone to give you one.
---
An automated handmade +33% VATS, +33% to bugs and mirelurks. I have rank 9 commando
---
I'm thinking about curing all and coming back with  marsupial,  healing factor, and bird bones (I like my jetpack flying too much sometimes)
---
Ah.
---
It’s not a bug it’s a “surprise feature”
---
Oh damn on which platform are you? Most of the time I joined acp when I was level 30 high levels would drop me plans and loot
---
Does this work for Atom Shop items even if you don’t own them?
---
Nice. I'll be picking that one up for sure.
---
5000 caps? Wow that's a huge head start. What do you mean by play styles?
---
So could I scrap all 6 of my hack/lockpick perk cards if I have max rank of Master Infiltrator Legendary Perk, or do you still need to hang on to the standard perk cards?    
---
Also also, do I need to get the Legendary Perk Cards from a pack, or are you just able to choose whatever you want into whatever available slot?
---
Honestly it's going to be hard to justify not just using everything for legendary SPECIAL slots. Other than ammo factory and the resurrect in PA perk, nothing is looking particularly useful to me.
---
Edit: And the poison resistance looks alright too
---
Stomp the brakes and put that thought right through the windshield.
---
I had not used it, but only because I did not know this. You are truly doing Atom's work.
---
They should change him into Ward Williams. He's show everyone what true wall glitches are about.
---
What’s your IGN?
---
Beyond Master Infiltrator, those legendary SPECIAL perks have me drooling.
---
The high jump is probably the marsupial mutation
---
Kind of like many of the affects are worthless for ADS play, but here we are.
---
Thank you for the guide. Some things I think need clarifying:
---
* Do the explosion-on-kill perks cause AOE damage? If so, how much and what is the radius?
---
* Does the increased damage from Follow Through apply to all damage sources or just the player with the perk? (For that matter, I wonder if the Tenderizer perk works the same way)
---
* How does Power Armor Reboot affect players who die with high rads? Are the rads eliminated? Does the player lose only some like after respawning? Or does the amount of rads stay the same as the moment of death? Thinking of Bloodied builds here.
---
* Also, does Power Armor Reboot trigger Revenant?
---
* Does the player themselves get the damage boost from Taking One for the Team? (I assume so). Do only members from your team get the bonus? What about players who aren't on your team but are sharing the same instance, such as during A Colossal Problem?
---
I wish low level players would stop running away
---
Not sure why your logic got downvoted... have an upvote 👍🏼
---
Nice! Appreciate the info! Think all I need left from there is the diffuser plan now, this should help!
---
Man that would be nice its technically aiming like I'm not just NOT aiming yknow
---
That thing is awesome, so quiet.  I want a Reactor Version.
---
It's quite possible that they have no idea what your intentions are or what you can do for them
---
Edit: to clarify, I assumed that high level players would want nothing to do with me since I can barely do enough damage to register on the enemies they're fighting
---
You can freely choose whatever Legendary Perks you want.
---
True I guess but still
---
Maybe that is the REASON that he is asking for the cloth donation.... This isn't a material donation for the BOS. It is a clothing drive donation so that he can get some new clothing.
---
Ya, no smoke and stackable!!
---
Basically, yes!  Use the Holo tape “Missile Silo status” to check any map your in 👍🏼
---
Wow, that makes sense but I didn't even think about it.  Thanks for the tip.
---
You would need to maintain 10mph for 24 hours. Very few people are capable of maintaining that assuming proper nutrition and hydration.
---
Platform?
---
It does?!
---
I just take workshops and seem to get it pretty often
---
Had this happen when I was using someone's sleeping bag. I was permanently fixed in 1st person and could only slowly crawl on the ground. The controls were reversed and when I tried to move my camera went haywire.  Had to alt+f4. 10/10 experience.
---
Bad? That’s up to you to decide. The each have a debuff associated with them.
---
I’m not sure what you don’t understand about “some of” not meaning every single player. Just because you don’t have every character a lot filled and you have “2k hours” doesn’t mean that other people that have both less or more hours than you have expanded their accounts to include builds for several different weapon types and play styles. This is quite literally one of the core selling points of an RPG. Fallout has always been about different choices that lead to vastly different gameplay experiences. If you chose not to take advantage of the fact that this iteration allows you to easily manage multiple play throughs simultaneously, that’s great, but not everyone plays the game that way.
---
How is it not punishing for one player to have to earn upwards of 20000 XP in order to level up while another player is able to earn only 360 XP (that is from level 2 to 3 according to the wiki)? There’s nothing that can equate these two numbers. No amount of Intelligence of aid buffs can make those numbers relatively comparable to one another. I get supporting Bethesda, but there is no way to justify that large of a gap in effort required to complete a challenge that rewards twice the amount of SCORE as the other dailies.
---
You can “agree to disagree” all you want but your attitude is the reason Bethesda is able to justify its predatory business practices. Not being able to support the members of the community who are unfairly or disproportionately impacted by systems/mechanics that take advantage of certain users is how games lose their player base and eventually die.
---
I mean team aggros come back so when I'm in a multi-team fight, I'm not constantly trying to get the other players aggro again.
---
I can build it for you if you want. But an easy way to get that plan is by taking cover workshops and defending it.
---
Yep try to get a full team with everyone running it and take a look at your specials.
---
Can you spend your banked respec points on anything or no?
---
Should have brought explosive bait back to destroy it.
---
Claim workshops.   Eventually it'll show up.  I'm still waiting for the windmill, myself.  Got the fusion Genny right off the bat though. . . Rng
---
Really??? That would be awesome! What would you like and need in return? Yeah, I need to improve my defense skills to be able to hold down the workshops
---
I don't think so.
---
Of course not - would Bethesda *really* allow that?
---
When I realized this was possible, I was in a teammate's camp. I haven't tested it out, but I  don't see why the person would even need to be on your team.
---
I just got 4 of them set up few hours ago
---
So other characters to bypass time gates, caps limits.....?
---
Fresh eyes make a difference sometimes :-)
---
No word on that change since the one interview it was mentioned, so no idea if it's just coming in a later patch or if they decided against it. 
---
Here's my experience though: in the live game I've got 90% food/aid weight reduction from my armor, a Refrigerated backpack, and carry around a ton of food, mostly melee food buffs for boss fights and for the Rejuvenated perk. In the PTS I switched out all of my armor, changed to a Chemist's backpack, and threw away all of my food and water. At rank one I get Survival Syringes at a rate where I still never need to worry about hunger or thirst; at max rank I presume I'd get enough Survival Syringes to basically always maintain the Well Fed/Well Hydrated benefits. 
---
I'm uncertain if I'll make this change for my character when the patch goes live, though. I'd have to re-roll all my armor, and I'd be losing out on all the melee food buffs I use.
---
Nothing at all. Well actually I think you need 4 razorgrain to build it. So besides that, I don’t need anything. Ps4 is Killer-Soldier1
---
If you’re on Xbox or pc I’m sure somebody else can build it for you :)
---
As long as you
---
Don’t scrap it, you can build it in all your camps.
---
Become a Junkie, you already have the weapon for it.
---
I mean they don’t play test their game very well, so it’s not really unlikely imo
---
I play on pc. 😔
---
If ur on Xbox I’m down to grind it w you HMU if u want my GT
---
If you play on PS4 we can test it
---
Awww,  yes. Yet another currency. .  . Grind my brothers, grind
---
I already run 11 luck as a heavy gunner, so tbh you could probably do anything you want.
---
Well I’m order for you to blueprint or highlight anything in a camp, you need to be part of the team, with whoever’s house that is. I know you can add and delete stuff when you invite a friend to a private team, but not so sure about public.
---
I have one if ur interested
---
Think about what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about Atom Shop items that can only be purchased using a premium currency.
---
How's the power? Is it just as bad as every other explosion in game? If so, then yeah, range need a buff. I love using consumable items like that. It's just a shame they're more for flavor than actual tactical advantage.
---
Woah, that's kinda cool
---
Yes, you can build things in another teammate's workshop if the team is public.
---
edit: oh, I think I misunderstood what was being asked. Yeah, I tested this. I successfully blueprinted from a teammate's CAMP and built the blueprint in my own CAMP. But It seems you can't do this if they're not on your team. No, it doesn't matter if the team is public or private.
---
I literally change our if a teammate was sharing our because I assumed it was a waste...
---
So other cards stack? Or if I use 2* Inspirational will it override the 1* Inspirational someone is sharing?
---
I know these have gotten alot of hate , but i think some of threm sound great
---
And they have released plenty of items from the atom shop that are broken or don’t work properly, and they barely test how things work inside an actual world environment, so to me it still doesn’t seem too unlikely
---
So you think Bethesda will let me have something I didn’t pay for? *laughs*
---
That Fixer was not overpriced.
---
That I'm not sure about...hmmm be cool if it does!
---
I’m not saying that it *DOES* work, I’m just saying I wouldn’t be surprised IF it works
---
Well, Treasury notes and XP are good. I'm going to try what that guy does in the video. Start the event, then run to the tunnels and collect ore, then go back to defend whichever scavenger is still alive.
---
What is ur PSN
---
Sentinel assassin AP refresh leather set.

---
It’s true, given the HUGE amount of materials required to craft PA it’s kind of absurd what scrapping yields
---
Shoulda stalked and murdered his mother and first born
---
Or if they weighed what they were charged
---
*sprays you with a spray bottle* no
---
I'd like to see more objectives in boss battles that may require a team maybe even a specialist or two.
---
Like turning off the pylons, but in rooms like Vault 94. Say one room could be enemy heavy that stealth gets through, another with enhanced perception that tanks could get through easier. A section with Radiation Rumble level rads to prevent a bloody player to activate. 
---
I'd like more aspects besides crouching for sneak or standing your ground in PA with a heavy.
---
You can use them to pick perks and then scrap them.
---
...please tell me you're joking.
---
I just posted my nuka build
---
#YES
---
Maxed out secret service armor gives DR and ER rivaling X-01. Rad resist isn’t as good but there aren’t rads in ACP
---
Yes. At this rate, I'll never be able to spend all of my Treasury notes if I keep earning more. And yet it takes me four days to save up enough bullion to buy the plans that I want. If we can't sell the things that we make from those plans anyway, why bother with a cap? It's not affecting the economy.
---
Again, what time gates? I’m not referring to characters specifically to farm NPC vendors caps. And a single account is limited to 150000 caps, there’s no way around that.
---
If you had taken time to read my comment I said they used alternate characters to run “shops or vendor character.” Have you never seen a player run stores? There was a player on Xbox with a Trashcan Carla account that ran a massive trading post for a large amount of time before Bethesda places in the hard carrying cap. There was another player who is still active who ran a little shop of horrors, specializing in unique items, base weapons, and apparel. No cheesing, no exploiting, just players who enjoy selling items, finding trades, and making deals. They didn’t dupe or use Nukas to get huge cap stashes, just enjoyed the economic side of the game.
---
Yes, it kills FPS. No, the Tesla users aren't immune to it.
---
Why stop at mother and first born?
---
Could i get a one?
---
Level 240 came over and took the workshop off of him and when he went over to see who was contesting his workshop, he got brassed up.
---
I think so too. I remember most gear stats changing like bloodied and berserker adjusts on the spot. One simple way though is to just compare your gear to their non-legendary counterparts
---
*no*
---
&gt;I'd like more aspects besides crouching for sneak or standing your ground in PA with a heavy.
---
This is so true. Pylons were a good start but that kinda got old and the old Vault raid scavenger hunts really sucked. Gotta find a happy medium.
---
Good point murder his entire family then move onto friends and neighbors but leave him alive, next don’t forget to steal his Identification bankrupt him and plant cp on his computer make an anonymous tip to police and sit back and watch)
---
Don’t actually do any of this btw the pandemic is making us all a lil crazier
---
Bonus though you can build multiples. I keep 1 for completed meals and 1 for raw ingredients
---
Too funny.
---
Spend 'a bunch' of stuff building the power armor crafting station.
---
  The get the amout of plastic from a pen when you scrap it. 😁
---
Just like how he dons a radiation suit whenever Monongah gets nuked
---
and they are super cheap and easy to make! i got my first batch the other day and oh man.
---
Yeah those fingers going through your chest would break your heart
---
Thanks very much for this, you've answered about 7 of my questions in 1 post.
---
Scopes and some other shit
---
Eat, Sleep, Fallout 76 🤣 I'm envious and this had definitely earned you bragging rights! 👍
---
that is perfect
---
By that i mean by what type of player u are, do u preffer to close combat or sneak around and cause damage, cause damage from a distance using long range weapons. Are u a tank, a low health player(several weapons have effects that inc damage if player has low health). Mutation effects and the perk card starched genes as well as the other perk card that reduces bad side effects of mutations. Personally im more of a close combat person so i have a bubch of melee weapons, just depends on what ur comfortable with and knowing what perk cards to use.
---
This is so weird! I ate 3 the other day and had no effects. Why is that?
---
The Interloper would make a great boss fight, I hadn’t even thought about that. But I think everyone can agree that we need some more end game level fights or activities.
---
I don’t see a single perk that excites me.
---
In fact for the majority of the playerbase if you PVP for workshops you're a bit of a cunt. 
---
I leave my workshops unlocked, take what you want. We're rebuilding the wasteland _together_. Don't be a selfish bastard.
---
You're missing the point totally.
---
You're aggro at me and this bite1t guy because we endorse using a fresh toon to level up and call it cheesing and exploiting. 
---
Im pointing out that it's hypocritical of you as you endorse using alts to have over 30k caps and hold your gear, which by its virtue is using new character creation to bypass limits (namely, Max individual caps and carry/stash capacity). It's one in the same.
---
If you don't want to have to spend ages levelling, then reduce you mule numbers and have a daily baby toon. Same as if I want more space, then I'll make a mule or trader toon.
---
I can't break it down any simpler than that.
---
I mean it doesn’t usually one shot most things anyway, hahaha
---
I feel you on the griefers. I have had several 300+ level players wait till I fully stock up a Workshop then drop me and try and take it. I have a Legendary Daisycutter (Mini Nuke Launcher) with 7-10 rounds I keep in my Stash box now for these guys. Oh you wanna take that? Here is a couple nukes for ya lol
---
What’s there now is actually less grindy and a bit simpler than this. You get 2 perk coins per card you trade in. That’s it. People didn’t like the whole thing with trading in Gold Perk Cards, so they axed it. The newly reduced upgrade prices make it much more reasonable than it was even a few weeks ago. 
---
I think they also need to add a 1 time award of 1 perk coin per level at launch to make up for the bugged out duplicate perk cards that people didn’t get to keep. But after the system is live and people have burned up all their duplicates and unspent perk packs, the system really isn’t bad.
---
We really do. ACP was a nice change of pace but in a few weeks we'll be over it and want something new. Just hoping daily ops will be enjoyable.
---
Run a bloodied build with 69 health for maximum karma farm
---
If you find something good for someone  else, you could maybe trade them for it.
---
But think about AA batteries, brand new and fully charged or 5 years old and dead there is no way to tell the difference in your hand, fusion cores follow the same idea.
---
There are some you can, but I won't say on here.
---
These are my perks, I heard gauss scales off of demo expert, but I’m not sure cause I don’t have one yet. All of my equipment is a work in progress to boot. I would definitely get rid of eagle eyes, and maybe talons and twisted muscles if you don’t melee a lot. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c176b8b&amp;d=pe0&amp;w=sg2eo2eu0eh2ip2sq2s32sr2ir2a72a04l71ls2lt2lu2ib4ce0cu2cm1
---
Edit: I also believe grounded messes with gauss damage but also unsure about that.
---
So if I had a 3 star instigating explosive black powder rifle I could trade it in?
---
Well, I wish I had 2, as it is the only thing keeping my lvl 32 dumbass alive
---
I got the Bear arms plan ages ago but only got one of the weapon mod plans recently, still trying for the other.
---
Also I'd take super duper it works on almost anything you craft including gear and if I recall correctly serums.
---
I've never really seen anyone build more than a few teir 1 turrets at a workshop.
---
Vats has had issues with most weapons since wastelanders dropped, some weapons it's totally broke.
---
Now I won’t get punished for winning a fight!
---
I've been a dirty PC gamer for a while now.
---
I meant to say CAMP, but you can do it at workshops as well. That should already have been obvious, since you can lay down blueprinted defenses at a teammate's workshop, like defensively elevated turret groups. My standard workshop deployment structure has a pair of elevated turrets together.
---
Yeah, though you do need to be teamed up with them.
---
[Welcome to the club](https://i.imgur.com/h7TxFcg.png)
---
Nice
---
In fallout I liked power armor builds that used small guns and energy weapons, close to mid range I guess. What should I be spending my special on?
---
Ok, now i know that'll be the first Legendary Perk I'll be getting for sure. I can finally use the space i use for 'Picklock' for something better and will no longer have to keep switching Perk Cards for 'Hacker'. Praise Mothman!
---
really can’t imagine a good use for the explosion on kills, especially with such low perfentages
---
I see it on player vendors quite often. On PS4 at least.
---
"Smoke weed everyday" cit. Snoop Dogg
---
I am very much looking forward to half of the map not having worthless low level enemies and loot.
---
This was very helpful!! I love it! Thank you OP!
---
Obviously.
---
Probably gonna get one point in Poison resist and then stack STR to maximize my commando-melee build
---
Does rad resist not just act like rad x but also rad away? I mean does it take radiation away? A lot of people use radiation to keep bloody health low
---
Just go to the computer and hit analyze.  You shouldn't need another blood sample. That worked for me and I had the same issues you do.
---
I gave her the tricentennial mascot head for a while, I loved it when she starts typing on the console and the dumbass Lincoln hat clips through the wall
---
Fortunately for you, Medics is not a preferred  Legendary effect.  Unfortunately, people want max level weapons in general for trading.   Don't focus too much on your weapons and build until 50, use the best you can get and then refine your build.
---
Does powerfist count as unarmed or melee or both?
---
I quit the game for this reason and they wont add anything or fix the damm game
---
It's nice to be appreciated :-)
---
Alright, will do.
---
Lately I've gotten in the habit of dropping one item quickly with the gift emote, standing up / crouch / stand up / crouch, spin around in a circle, and only afterward going into the pip-boy and slowly picking all the rest of the items I want to drop. That seems to hold their attention &amp; give them the idea that more gifts might be coming. Also, some players will respond by opening up their own pip-boy and beginning to look for something to drop back... that gives more time before they take off.   
---
Even with this technique, about 10/20 gifts I attempted to drop for different players today went unopened. I say and/or sing "it's a gift for you!" on the mic in area chat too... sniff.
---
It is a bug and happens to some. I stopped using some weapons because of it.
---
They do this in GTA V you’d think Bethesda could figure it out.
---
Having just done the math, yeah both methods are pretty much the same. Using the system I thought of thinking in 5 level increments (as currently you get a perk card pack every 5 levels) you get 5 perk coins from leveling and a possible 6 more if you scrap every single card you get in your pack for a total of 11. The system that's in place now you get 10 if you scrap every card. 
---
I guess the main difference is you don't feel pressured to scrap every card you have and ever will have. Just a bit more flexibility. You also still get a little bonus for every level you gain past 50 whereas now you don't and all the levels just blur into each other.
---
How about prototype Liberty Prime, which is full of bugs and out of control like this game?
---
Is taking one for the team something that should just be taken by everyone, even if you are on a pible team alone it ups your damage?
---
I’m lvl 270 and have been playing for around 300 hrs.  I’ve only once had no one show up to a nuke event...and that was mostly I think bc whoever dropped it on the queen did it where you had to fight in a nuke zone.   So I dunno what servers your hopping in.  I honestly don’t mind soloing either of the nuke events either and sometimes it’s enjoyable to have that challenge!  That’s kinda a bright side to look on it!
---
It constantly removes Radiation at the rate it describes. At higher Ranks you can walk in Radiation zones with a Radiation Suit or Power Armor and have zero Rads.
---
They nerfed the Power Armor Reboot from the last I heard of it. It used to go up to 40% chance of revival and now it's 30%. I mean I get why but still, that woulda been nice.
---
The plans are a rare drop from events in Cranberry Bog, the best is Census Violence since it rolls twice on the rare drop table for rewards.
---
Would be nice to see a enemy/player kill counter on favorited weapons
---
I like it. Event should play out like the Giant Robo-Scorpion battle from New Vegas. Big area, lots of lasers and explosions, and melee builds get stepped on.
---
I have to agree, I'm trying to reroll one of my SS armour and it's been over a week now, doing 3 a day or I I stockpile for a couple days
---
The RNG sucks ass dude
---
Is it out yet on regular servers
---
Well I’ve been playing since game launch, this is the worst lag I’ve experienced. As soon as the event is over the fps was back to normal. So I assume it was related to the teslas.
---
You have to literally get the final kill shot to get the credit. Best on private server with friends
---
I want a super mutant stronger than a behemoth, to be introduced as a boss fight cutscene, and immediately killed by a radroach. The roach then takes it’s loot and power, and the real fight begins
---
Honestly I don't care either way as I have little issue keeping well fed/hydrated - in fact I have the issue of slowly accumulating too much stew/dog food/water. So i'd be using them for the buffs regardless.
---
That said, Bethesda has a track record of not testing stuff on the PTS (either back when it was private, or now as public) so just 'cos it's not live on it now doesn't mean they won't push it straight out anyway.
---
On one hand I agree with you and I love your idea, on the other hand I look at the armors and I think about the scrappers who would just hit each spawn and collect it all to scrap while new players with no power armor never come across a set. I mean when they had the daily for scrapping or crafting 3 power armor pieces I went to every world spawn location on one server and I only found 2 pieces of raider armor, everything else either was not there or already stripped off the frames. That is the danger I feel, if you make something a limited spawn and make it really good for scrap, you run the risk of it always being scrapped.
---
I feel it should have remained. Why even have fridges, rain catchers etc. It needed to be scaled back as my character behaved like a 600lb fatty wanting to eat and drink every two seconds....
---
But to be totally removed has made the survival element even pissier.
---
My friend got the helmet
---
It disappeared for no reason tho
---
Time gating and token systems aren't some new mechanic recently invented by seedy mobile game companies, games like mmos have used them for ages to help stretch out content to keep their players occupied between releases.
---
Hell ya!
---
Love seeing this!! If you need people to play with, I'd like to invite you to r/PKOA dont worry about platforms as we have players on all 3 :) I'm on PS4 myself
---
Thanks for this!  I’m still holding out hope that perk coins will end up being added as event rewards or something like that. The costs just don’t make sense unless there’s another source beyond card scrapping.
---
Grind reputation with Foundation + grind alot of bullion and you can buy it from their bullion trader.
---
Also, the heads twitch as well.. real freaky
---
Rule 10.  If you think you're the first person to complain about either scrip or bullion limits you're sadly mistaken.
---
This is it in a nut shell. These are mobile game tactics to manipulate people into spending money. Except in this game you can’t even spend money to extend your scrip or bullion limits (unless it’s an eventual plan). 
---
Right now I think they are doing it as an artificial content progression gate to prevent players from going hardcore for a solid month and getting everything they want in game and quitting. By doing this artificial gating they are hoping they can slowly trickle out game updates that will keep us busy. Unfortunately knowing that progress gating is their real method to their madness (and not immediate profit, even though long term players contribute to long term profit), even if they did away with these daily limits they would just make the price to buy everything exorbitantly expensive (which would still gate progress and be equally shitty for the community).
---
The ultimate solution is to make more content constantly and have tons of things to buy and do. We know that high frequency content releases are not going to happen, therefore neither will their progress gates they have in place. Unless it’s to replace limits with higher scrip and bullion prices.
---
I feel conflicted about the Hunger/Thirst in FO76.  On one hand, a Survival game really should have a mechanic of eating/drinking, on the other the on in FO76 was trivial and just a nagging thing.  So in short I don't give a shit.
---
Buy it from Stanley (or whatever that guy's name is at Foundation) for a whopping 4k gold bullion.
---
But why not do it? It doesn't affect choosing to do the final mission for the militia-I mean, the raiders.
---
Take my upvote
---
As someone who uses a full-health build, I'm really excited for the "What Rads?" perk. I currently use "Sun Kissed" and it works great, but the healing only works during the day. I can take that off and use a different card now.
---
I can help. My name is TheDanioKing on pc social! (More or less my friend can, I’m a diversion for the spawns, and will heal you in your inevitable demise)
---
Thank you for the info. It's good to have it all in one place. Concerned that most of them are useless/gimmicky. Seems that most people will take the Ammo Smith, Lockpicking/Hacking and/or Legendary special ones and the rest will just be forgotten or taken as a laugh. And Follow Through seems stupidly OP for builds that are already stupidly OP...
---
Damn!lmao
---
You get the windmill plans from doing a 'Powering up' power station event. One of the 3 possible plans that drop when completing that event at any of the 3 power plants in the game.  Not a workshop drop.

Does that ex bait still work?or does it attract animals? It was right next to w.s train station
---
Awesome thank you!
---
I made a blueprint at someone else's CAMP and it was available at my CAMP, but I didn't *deploy* it. I'll go do that now.
---
Yes, you can deploy it, but you can't blueprint any objects for which you have not learned the plans. When you try to highlight the object it's listed as something like "not available". I expected it to allow you to blueprint, but not build, like things which are already listed as unavailable options by default in your CAMP (when you haven't learned the plan yet, or purchased the item in the atomic shop).
---
Ah ok. Is there a almost guaranteed spot in the map for the case?
---
True enough. Enemies also don't cluster up often. But it's worth asking about anyway.
---
That sucks, they really need to come up with a better respec system overall, and instead they're making legendary perks swapping also drain the same resource needed to level them up.
---
If they do that then the mine collapsing should act as a death, ridding you of your junk so that there’s a reason to run
---
I’ll unfortunately have to buy it from Stanley* I was a little quick on the gun and just did the raider quest line the day the update came out like a dummy
---
The event is buggy in the last minute. Better deposit before the last minute, you’ll need at least 25 to clear.
---
Im Xbox, someone on pc should be along shortly.
---
I agree
---
Awh. Thanx.  I've done that several times, but I never works.
---
I’m waiting for a giant “reaper death claw” boss fight
---
You can’t have all of them. You have to choose between carnivore and herbivore, and unless you are in a team and everyone has it I’d stay away from empath.
---
Doing it for your BF as well? Thats love right there :P lol
---
GET 'EM OUT AND COMMENT "NICE" BOYS!! HE DID IT!!
---
No, later this month
---
This.  That perk is probably the #1 reason to run with power armor.  If you're bloodied/unyielding, then having emergency protocols on your chest piece would be another major one.  However, the only time you NEED stabilized is for queen or colossus.  It's very easy to make a build where you can swap out stabilized for something else and swap in non power armor stuff like serendipity for the other 99.9999% of your game time when you're just running around the wasteland.  Outside of power armor without stabilized, you're going to absolutely own everything you come across without that PA just fine.  Personally I like having different outfits on my characters, not power armor, so just everyday play outside of those bosses I've got my power armor set chillin in the bags waiting for the death from above alarm to go off.
---
Just look at what you want to spec into and start getting perks that work with whatever build you are trying out. I’m only level 118 but trust me you have plenty of time to move your special points around after 50
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151/
---
How many players saw failed events, and you completed each one every time?
---
The Fancy Pump Action shotgun. Looks pretty with gold inlays and fixed legendary perks.
---
It's something like a 1-3% drop chance. But the worst part is just trying to redeem the damn tickets. That robot is so damn slow.
---
I had a guy drop me a ton of plans a couple of days ago. Most of them I had, but it was the thought that counted. Then the next day I came back to my cabin and someone had came in and redecorated it with all these trophy heads all over the walls. They even had a big death claws head hanging on the back of my shed. I thought it was a buddy of mine but he said he didn't do it. So thanks to whoever did it.
---
The range was kept small because you used to be able to build multiple artillery guns in a CAMP, so PvP server griefers could just move their CAMP in range of someone else's with a bunch of artilleries in storage, plop them all down real quick, then wipe the targeted CAMP off the map with a single grenade calling a strike from each gun in less than a minute.
---
By the time they got around to fixing it, open PvP had already failed, so they never bothered making any adjustments other than nerfing the build limit to a single gun per CAMP since players were already obliterating the strongest PvE enemies without needing artillery or orbital strikes due to overpowered builds with carried weapons.
---
They're really only in the game because the assets and coding were left over from FO4, then they never bothered adjusting them to fit in anywhere in 76's gameplay.
---
I’m a sneak sniper, I run with 3, 15, 3, 3, 6, 15, 11. If you’re going to be using rifles you need max perception to get all the damage cards and max agility to get the sneak cards and max action points. Luck helps with criticals and mutation cards.
---
I based by build on this and then adjusted it for better quality of life. I probably need to move some endurance to luck for more crit cards though
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/ladydeath/?rid=2355
---
I haven’t seen any low level guys taking out the spawns in any of my runs and my last one was the breaking point I’m leaning towards wishing there was a level requirement
---
Lever rifles are great. If you want to use them you’ll need more in perception and agility. Here’s an example of a rifle build that could use them. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d547cc&amp;d=lt2l12a72pd2pk2pl2a32ic3iq2cr0ej3e60sa0sb1lk2a02pp2c62a42p00lv2&amp;n=Rifleman%20Build
---
Dint worry too much about your mistakes, you can move special points around after level 50 if you need to. But use that tool and look up rifleman builds on google and this sub to get ideas for a build to work towards. Everyone’s first go is a bit of a mess but it’s fine, it can be fixed!

I dint understand why some people are upset about the perka themselves not being account wide. You all do realize that means your highest level character will unlock x amount of Legendary perk slots for *all" of your characters and leaves the option for you to customize each character with the legendary perks that best suit them?
---
My melee charcater will utilize different perks than my heavy gunner. If I had to spend points to change those everytime I wanted to switch characters, that would suck ass. The legendary perk system is good as is for account purposes, the coin system could still use a bit of tweaking though. You'll have to get to 600+ on multiple characters to max all their perks, that's the biggest grind they've added so far. It also doubles down on the desire to maximize xp gains along side the season progression. Double xp weekends will be major opportunities for some serious gainz.
---
So from what I gather here, it was then a mistake for me to upgrade a lot of my perk cards when I had multiple copies?  2 perk coins regardless if the card has one star, 2, 3 or whatever.  So a fully maxed out Expert Rifleman gets me two perk coins, but if I hadn't had ranked it up I would have had 6 coins? How depressing.
---
Gaming system?
---
Pc
---
At the very least, increase script you can get OR put in. I wouldn't care either way. I do so many events, that I now have 15 characters. 15. Because I don't want to drop all the script I get and let it go to waste. And some of it isn't even technically bad weapons, there's some I know someone will use and I wouldn't wanna script. I just need to find the people who want them and trade. But the script, I'm over weight every day now cause of how many Earles or queens I do. Getting 2-3 weapons per event. And usually they end up being 10-20 lbs weapons. Or they could increase stash limit. I'd be okay with any of the 3 options.
---
Follow through MAY be tempting for me depending on how it interacts with the damage calculation, but overall it's really hard to compete with +5 to a SPECIAL.  5 carefully chosen perk cards and the benefit of 5 points in a stat outweigh most of the other legendary perks.
---
Poison resist and ammo crafting are the other two tempting ones, and even ammo crafting might be worth the hassle of putting on an alt given the tradeoff.
---
If legendary perks could be freely swapped some of the others would look more appealing, but with a resource cost to swap situational legendary perks are hard to justify.
---
Sorry, cant help. Just let people know your looking for one. To most, medics is script.
---
I tested this out. If you haven't learned the plans for something yet, you can't add it to the blueprint. I don't think it matters whether or not it's an atomic shop item.
---
It’s to get you to log in daily but they don’t understand if they took this boring shit out people would be more inclined to log in daily to do the fun stuff
---
This was funny.
---
If he had stable internet and wasn't working, I might make him do it. Lmao.
---
&gt; Legendary Perks themselves are NOT shared across all characters - Each character has to choose and upgrade Legendary Perks individually.
---
Wait, when was this changed? I remember their entire fucking advertisement around this was that it will transfer to new characters and give you an edge if you want to try alternate builds
---
Ah, I should elaborate on that. It's 2 Perk Coins per card per rank. So a Rank 3 Expert Rifleman will get you 6 Perk Coins. I'll update the post.
---
Yes, that’s exactly why I did something different. 
---
Why pay 25K caps to get a bloodied magic minigun that will only help yourself, rather than spend nothing-10K caps to help your whole team?
---
Remember there was a character in FO4 who did that?  Walked around making motorcycle noises?
---
In homage, sometimes I turn on my mic and play this: [12 hours of Harley-Davidson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnfgMywx0e0#t=20s)
---
Now, go play that in a background tab and come back to watch this video.
---
Hey hey 👋 lol
---
Groosssssss. Now I have to go shoot mah rug.
---
I usually just keep one alive if I'm doing it solo and so far I have a bunch of lab coats and a formula P plan
---
I'm kind of confused how this will stack with my current cards. If I have Strength and Perception maxed at 15 right now, how or will I need to add to these SPECIAL characteristics or will.they need to go on other Special stats that aren't maxed?
---
It also appears that the Wasteland is going to be a lot more difficult and dangerous in the near future.
---
Magic weapons still exist in the pts.
---
I agree the sbq mob is much more diverse hence more fun
---
I have a couple medics handmades, just as a tip, 25% less vats cost is more important than ffr. Use 4 leaf cliver in luck n with a commando build, everybody clise heals like they just took a stim
---
What’s ffr
---
Toke em if you got em
---
That and it ruins any kind of Instigating Build if there's a cluster of enemies and they all lose a tiny amount of health from the Explosion.
---
This. I remember they'd lurk at whitesprings during nukes. Wait until they copped some stray damage and rip through groups of people to farm the collective junk drops.
---
I don’t think so
---
So essentially when this goes live if I’m level 150 I can pick 4 perks?
---
I was literally singing that song in my head when I was reading this post, only to click on your link..... and then of course lead to this:
---
https://youtu.be/aVZUVeMtYXc
---
Faster fire rate.
---
Just like the players who “didn’t help at all” are mad at people who kill them in under 3 seconds
---
Ah, I see
---
Anyone know the regen rate for Sunkissed?  Trying to compare against What Rads? but “slowly regain” doesn’t really help numerically.
---
If you have 15 in your actual SPECIAL, before any bonuses, then you will gain nothing from Legendary SPECIAL perks.
---
I have plans for both bear arm mods if you’re on PS4.
---
I am literally in the same boat. I now have 4 accounts all for mulling (20 characters). Between weight limits and scrip limits it sucks.
---
what platform are you on i am sure there are people who could craft it for you
---
It's always been that way. The only thing you share is the Slots themselves, not the Perks.
---
You'll still have the ability to equip 6 Legendary Perks (If you unlocked them on another character) on a Level 1 character, but those Perks will be Rank 1.
---
At least there is no Daily Perk Coin limit.
---
Nevermind, work shops.
---
The unicorn medics is ffr n less vats cost. Dont get hung up on what rifle it is. Noone in my group stays close for long and/or nerd rage bloodied so my medic rifle sit in stash, but im on ps4.
---
Well I mean for events like acp
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Windmill
---
I'm a HUGE fan of this site in general.  It is usually fairly up to date. It isn't perfect, but I love it.
---
-------dont give them any ideas. .  .
---
I'd argue SS armor is actually better.
---
And you'll spend the same amount of bullion but have like 300+ resistances and 15x legendary aspects instead of a shimmery outline and fall damage.
---
For a free suit- cool. To buy it. Nah........
---
Edit- I actually play a stealth toon too if that helps. However, for Nuke zones the CSA is still supreme.
---
Yeah, its really annoying when that happens, i honestly wish it was just open like SBQ
---
I tried it out on PTS and it wasn't worth it at all. I had the last rank equipped of Far Flunged Explosives and 20% makes it so it triggers very rarely and when it does most of the times there are no enemies nearby or the explosion takes too long too trigger.
---
So I'm no way picking any of those perks on the live servers.
---
They never said that. At the very first Quakecon last year when legendary perks were discussed they said that something might be account-wide, and that turned out to just be the slots.
---
You should be well fed after eating a Mirelurk Queen, a deathclaw or a scorchbeast. Having to eat five or six of them multiple times a day is straight up ludicrous and really breaks any kind of authenticity.
---
Three hots and a cot should be enough.
---
This. I perked out my first character the way I perked my character in FO4: "This perk looks useful." By level 30-40 in Fo76, my first character was useless af.
---
I got smarter. Looked up builds. Made a second character, and once I finally hit level 20, I am now having more fun with my secondary character (also a bit useless, but that is because the build I want is mostly geared towards end game, so I just don't have the perk cards to spend my perk points yet). 
---
I will say as someone who has not seen level 50 yet, that freaking grind between level 11 &amp; level 20 is obnoxious af. At least in FO4, I had side quests/lore/factions/storylines I could explore/learn about, or areas I could clear out as a lower level player. In Fo76, there are some quests I just can't do on my own (Monogath power plant, Thunder Mountain power plant, earning Rose's Trust, anything with an assaultron). I know other folks don't mind helping me, but I also feel bad as these are individual quests, so barring XP and feeling helpful/useful, I don't feel like they get much reward out of helping me advance in the game. And I feel somewhat guilty for trying to join the larger events ("Clossal whatever" and "Scorched Earth") because my weapons are shit and barely do any damage to help out. I don't feel like I am pulling my own weight, or capable of doing individual quests on my own in this game, and it's a terrible feeling. I used to get so much pride out of killing a tough boss/enemy/quest in FO4 (on low levels that quest was freeing Nick Valentine. It may have taken me 2 hrs, but dammit, I rescued him!). I haven't found my sense of pride moment yet :/ Even bringing Posidon power plant online by myself (twice!) within the time limit doesn't bring that much pride. It's a delightfully frustrating puzzle, but not really a "work at this for two hours, you'll get the hang of it, and get a solid reward out of it." I did get the fusion cell generator and large generator plans, which were my goals, but it wasn't a "Ha! Yes yes yes! I did it!!!" moment like clearing out areas in FO4, killing a mirelurk queen, clearing out mutants or raiders from an area, freeing Nick Valentine,  destroying the Brotherhood, destroying the Railroad, destroying the Institute, etc.
---
I am having fun accomplishing my own goals along the way (claiming workstations and getting all of the resources to be available), but I don't really see myself playing this game every day once the main storyline is done, the way I did with FO4.
---
&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/aaw5yI8
---
Haha, that's right! Thank you so much! If you're a raider, you might appreciate the photos I just added with some backstory about my little Crater Raider 😎
---
When does this come into the game?
---
Thanks for clarifying and dispelling my depression.  ;)   You do us all a service with compiling this info!
---
I like the survival part of it I started playing fallout 3 and I was like this game is awesome then the games got better I don’t think they should take it out but fix how long drinks and food last
---
Other cool encounters like this can happen at the two radioactive craters, usually scorched or mutants fighting a large creature
---
That's a bit stupid. The slots don't really matter if you still need to scrap a ton of cards to fill them up. If you are maxing or even just ranking up your legendary cards as you go along, unlocking more slots early will have absolutely no benefit
---
Personally I do not use power armor, i use the chinese stealth armour to move around and deal 2.75x mlre damage up close, as for a power armor build i suggest get intellegence and strength up a bit to get the perks 
---
Power User
---
Portable power
---
And there was a perk that said that gives a chance to repair fusion core energy thru enemy attacks but not too sure, u could look up some videos but thats what i would recomend as needed
---
PC sorry, thanks tho.
---
I saw what you wrote before you edited it. No, you can't drop down items in another player's CAMP that they haven't learned how to build yet. You can't even build in another teammate's CAMP. But you CAN create blueprints from structures in a teammate's CAMP or workshop, then build those buildings in your own CAMP, or in any teammate's workshop (assuming for workshop structures that your blueprint doesn't contain items not allowed to be built in workshops, like non-foundation floors).
---
Usually when I mention it, people say "oh you're a hoarder you need to stop!" I'm glad the first person who replied is agreeing. I just don't want to waste script. Like what's the point in wasting it, when it's given to you. I'm also a active trader, so most my mules have a mix of script, and collection pieces, and also weapons for trades. I have a long list as well. I just need to get fallout first back which is actually a God send tbh, cause scrap box. without my scrap box id probably have more or id just never pick up junk. RN I just give all my friends my flux and whatever I get from events which is a waste almost
---
Wait, are you saying we can adjust our special points??
---
Gotcha, so they need to go to other perks to try to level other stats to 15 if I go that route. Thanks.
---
My generator was getting destroyed all the time.realized I'm near a mutant spawn.walled it up seems to be ok now
---
This almost just happened to me, and it has happened in the past. They should really have a loot chest outside of the mine that is linked to Earle’s corpse so that the loot can still be obtained. Icing on the cake would be that the hypothetical chest is also linked to all the wendigo bodies so that we get a little more bang for our bullets.
---
It's going to take such a grind that you might want to consider restarting on a new character if you're not very high level.
---
The bullions are a 3 weeks grind, 1700 a week maximum.
---
The rep is going to take months.
---
Just saying. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You die while killing Earle? Might need to re-think your attack method....just saying
---
Love it I’ll rip my bong and take a dab in celebration
---
My dude. My guy. My chum.
---
It was literally the first Bullet Point, I even put bold font to help:
---
"Legendary Perks are estimated to launch with "***One Wasteland For All***" - A Patch scheduled for release during **September**, currently."
---
I get that you might not want to read a Wall of text, but come now.
---
I just finished them, and OMG, yes. It felt like she was setting up my low level character to constantly die. At least I did level up 3 times during her stupid "Earn Rose's Trust" quest line, but I am a bit salty that my character isn't powerful enough/doesn't have the right tools to clear out enemies by Rose's memorial to look at more Rose/David lore. I had to have *help* to finish out her bullshit keys quest (couldn't defeat a Wendigo at level 25, though, admittedly I am building this character to he heavy gunner, which is more of an end game play, but still! Obnoxious. I didn't have such issues in FO4, though granted, that was also in part to my "save early and save often" playstyle).
---
I am enjoying this game now, but based on the things I find annoying, I don't forsee this game being playable for me once I finish out the main quests. I don't know how invested I will be at that point for dropping nukes/figuring out what happened to the Brotherhood. Thank God for oxhorn.
---
I completely agree SS is better. I rock a full set of SS armor all modded definitely the way to go with armor. But I don’t use energy weapons or PA so I don’t have anything to spend my bullion on right now so it’s something to work towards. Unless you can suggest one of the PA sets to try out
---
Thanks for this guide, it's very useful
---
If that's the position you're in then why not buy it :) Alternatively, maybe sit on your bullion if you don't *need* the CSA and you might get yourself a head start on whatever the BoS brings with them.
---
Hi. :)
---
The plush screams, the heads twitch, the rug bleeds and blood pile is probably his insides.
---
Thank you for the link I'll look into it, I had no idea we could move them around after level 50.
---
You should probably wait until level 50 onwards to find a good one that you can forever use for your Medics style.
---
There are many ways to die just as Earle is dying. Not watching for falling debris, getting swarmed by spawns, glowing crap on the ground, or my personal favorite: getting feared into any of the above.
---
Most of these are avoidable, but sometimes RNGesus smites you.
---
It doesn't just work at any time of day, but it works WHILE you're being irradiated too! Sunkissed doesn't do that!
---
Combined with Ghoulish, you'll have crazy health regen in any Nuke zone.
---
When will they release it?
---
Yep. Each level after 50 lets you choose to either gain a perk card, or reassign one special point.
---
Yes, very easily post 50.
---
Graham sells them? Or you got it from meat week?
---
I’m not that far from completing the rep grind probably another month or so... lol other than I have a bunch of bullion saved already. The main character i want to use it with is 337 so that’s outta the question.
---
Interesting! Had never heard of that, thank you.
---
Pls respond
---
It does feel satisfying and I’m not usually a “completionist” in video games. I was honestly not expecting to finish so I surprised myself and felt paid off for the rewards imo.
---
Have all perks at every level, 600+ perk points, &amp; 49 unopened card packs @ lvl 780...ready to max out most of the good &amp; useful legendary perk cards day one.
---
Two things:
---
1. Let’s say I have a level 200 character and a level 100 alt. How many slots do I unlock?
---
2. From what I recall on the pts patch notes, wasn’t proliferator removed temporarily while they fixed a bug with it?
---
Yeah I'm looking forward to that one too. Constant rad healing will be nice, I can take off lead belly.
---
That's good! I'm glad it didn't kill your interest in the game, that happened for a lot of people T\_\_T I was also so satisfied with my rewards, but exhausted lol
---
I saw this repeatedly on PS4. It's almost comical how someone can miss with a NUKE.
---
If that is your playstyle, Fo76 might not be for you. Might I recommend Call of Duty or Ark: Survival instead?
---
One thing to keep in mind is that you’ll need to swap perk cards around a lot if you want a good build. Eg use damage focused cards normally but switch them out for crafting focused perk cards when you’re at your camp. It’s a pain but it’ll help you be optimised. Apparently perk card loadouts will come in the future someday so that’ll make it a lot easier
---
Thank you
---
and thank you!
---
Behold, He is coming with the cloud!
---
Enemies will scale to a max level from 50-100 depending on region and enemy type. Like, everything in the Forest will only scale to lvl 50 max, but like the enemies in the Savage Divide or Cranberry Bog can go up to 100.
---
Its happened to me once or twice but that's my fault not paying attention while changing perks lol
---
I feel the same way. The only time I think the "no" comes across as a simple "no" is when asking someone yes/no questions because they don't have a mic. The "confused" emoji works as a solid "maybe" and "I have no preference."
---
That's why you need to be extra cautious when he's close to dying. The adrenaline (the real stuff, not the perk) and urge to just finish him off and loot as quickly as possible needs to be kept in check. When he's close to dying remain calm and keep an eye on your surroundings and health bar. It's the same reason people end up losing their flux at the end of Scorched Earth.. The SBQ dies and everybody mindlessly rushes in to loot her and gets taken out by the last minute adds. When she goes down you need to remain calm and make sure the situation is safe before looting.
---
Thank you for clarifying that for me - and answering it the way I was hoping you would!
---
Good to know! So is it worth it?
---
That kind of sucks... That it takes that long to max them out. Still leagues better than what it was.
---
One of these days I swear some one will trash one of their legendaries this way.something with a skin or a wastlanders piece
---
1. You unlock 5 slots. Unlocking them is based on your highest level character only.
---
2. It was removed completely from what I've seen.
---
No news so far, but it’s not coming with the next patch. Sometime this fall according to the roadmap still but it’s not looking hopeful with all the delays. Not even in the PTS I believe.
---
As a side note, this is why I sell plans for 1 cap at my base. All plans. The BS common ones that are ubiquitous (tinkers bench, armor bench)? 1 cap. If I wind up with an extra "large generator" or "power cell generator" plan, it's going in the vending machine for 1 cap. Fuck this plan gate keeping Bethesda seems to be a fan of.
---
Yessir! I wouldn’t stress much about it, but here is a website you can use to brainstorm potential builds for yourself. If you plan on playing well past level 50, I would think about what you want to play with for end game. I am a heavy gun PA build which I think is fun, but definitely something to put thought into! Have fun with it!
---
https://nukesdragons.com
---
I don't think the negative effects should be removed, rather the rate at which hunger/thirst goes down needs to be adjusted. Even with the horrors of the wasteland, there is no reason for my character to be having a 3 course meal every 5 minutes.
---
Then it makes sense to grind.
---
Thought you were more new to the game, like under 100. 😊
---
Can you become addicted to either of the new chems?
---
To wit, just because you cook a meal doesn't mean it always comes out good
---
What I want--a muh'fukin DEATHCLAW but for him to actually speak and howl out at the combatants in the area. Like a super smart one.... We know it's lore friendly. They've spoken before. 
---
And for him to be strong. Crazy strong. Not a sponge but have like a cleave or swipe that one shots like everything in an arc.... People need to die more often. Not just to the cave cricket the bloodied guy didn't see.
---
What do you play on? I have yet to come across anything like that on ps4
---
This happend last night to some one on here as well.but that guy had screenshots...  pics or it didn't happen..lol it seems to be a rare bug so far.yesterdays o.p was kicked as well
---
I did this with fo3. I play after I do everything I need to do, or lvl up one of my alts.
---
Nope.
---
Did he get banned?
---
Yeah that entrance closes so you can't fly back up when he's dead. Oof. Glad you figured it out. I usually stand there or in the other corner with a ceiling when doing ACP, luckily never once dying to the collapse. Pure luck, I didn't move on purpose or anything.
---
It's actually the rewards. For every 10 million he loses an article of clothing.
---
His final 'surprise' is after its achieved.
---
I dont think he did.i didnt see if he updated.you should be ok.plenty of odd bugs in this game
---
The whole UI needs cleaning up and to be modern and fresh.
---
Seems prehistoric now and clunky, not forgetting when it lags.
---
Nah just leave it as it is an focus on what really needs to be fixed instead. If it aint broken don't fix it
---
Hardened mass and plastic...throw in some screws too.
---
Fully aware, it's what I was referencing. You just can't progress to any degree if you can't cause damage.
---
That was way more info than I expected.  You rock.
---
Yep
---
Forest is maxed at L50 too IIRC.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423679/new-features-in-the-pts
---
This says that it was temporarily removed a while back. But we haven’t heard about it since.
---
They should let us sell them to vendors. Hand thrown nades are so under powered and are so heavy -.-
---
Oh that would make me so sad.
---
That's is an amazing camp!!
---
Going afk in an event area is just... So weird. At worst, you're in the way of someone else's ability to kill something. At best, you're a solid target to distract beasties with while others kill them. Shit happens sometimes, but it's just so weird.
---
The grind I shall do then!  Yeah unfortunately I made a new player mistake and got a lil hiffy and just went full raiders. I won’t make that mistake twice.
---
Xbox
---
Tug it faster.
---
can you use the buffed SPECIALs to equip more perk cards? Is that what you mean by "perk points"?
---
See if you can replace 3 more points in Luck for Bloody Mess (+15% dmg)
---
Is it in the Atomic shop yet?
---
I heard that if you throw it at Camps it destroys them, but idk
---
Is the legendary specials added like unyielding armor or do they actually allow you to equip more perks for the chosen legendary special. Ty
---
My Excavator was missing when I logged on this morning.  Cursed, took a deep breath and went and killed enough Mole Miners to have the Black Titanium to craft a new set Of Excavator with calibrated shocks and improved it by using the Caps. Cosmos skin.
---
I drop into stealth just as he's about to die and finish off with something silenced or let others do the last sliver. 
---
Learned this as i wanted to loot screws and fiber after the event, not fight wendigos that keep spawning. 
---
Doing this helps not attract aggro so you can loot earle, then allows you to stay hidden/caution while picking up ammo and wendigo screws
---
I get that- there is a great deal of caution needed but there’s a significant different between Earle and SBQ and that is that you can always go back to pick up your stuff from SBQ’s corpse but not for Earle- which as a whole makes it significantly more punishing if you die from a random cause. While I’ve learned to just back up near the end of the fight and start picking off spawns, it still greatly punishes anyone who dies at the very end- maybe even unfairly given that you’ve lost a legendary item that *you cannot access again*.
---
That’s a shame honestly. I mean I’d only expect it but it doesn’t make it any less annoying. But don’t let it get you down because for every player like that there’s 10 more who would gladly help repair it with you
---
I died to collapse after respawning just before Earle was killed. That roof collapse immediately so you can't go back up that way
---
Abandoned mineshaft 4- on shelf in taller building on second floor
---
Hornwright’s Estate- in basket of Evelyns room
---
Red rocket filling station- by radio
---
I don't think it should be removed, but most food should be a lot more filling.  I shouldn't need to shove a steak, a bowl of soup and a bottle of water in my face every 15 minutes.
---
The fridge should be replaced with a very low capacity freezer with zero spoilage, so it's actually useful.  Cooking for bonuses is enough of a hassle as it is, let me store a handful of ingredients or meals for later use.
---
^this
---
Thanks
---
I could live with the fact it doesn’t go if they made the bars not drain so quickly
---
I got this side quest a few days ago when I was level 20. I wish there had been a level cap. It was a pretty lame side quest, IMO, with little in the way of reward. I dislike the lighting in the mine, so I'm definitely not going back. I prefer the SBQ over Eddie. There's more room for someone low level to feel like they got something done *and* to get out of the way from the folks with the amazing weapons/specs. And hell, depending on what you hit and with what weapon, you likely have helped out in the SBQ event.
---
SBQ feels like some level of organized chaos... Eddie just feels like chaos for the sake of chaos.
---
Howd you get locked in?
---
You didn't glitch through a window activating a bench did you......?
---
Ooh. Just wait til you get to the bunker under The Whitesprings. There’s a very...creepy but very interesting AI there. And, if you listen to various audio recordings on terminals around the bunker, you can piece together why Appalachia is such a hellhole; why Liberators, Super Mutants, and ultimately Scorchbeasts were unleashed on the population. I don’t wanna say too much to avoid spoilers, but let’s just say the Secretary of Agriculture, of all people, is an absolute madman.
---
Let me start by saying that I personally do not have a mule account on my main account I regularly play on. I have five full build character each specializing in different weapons and play styles. I do not have the option of emptying a mule to use for leveling without throwing away days if not weeks of progress. My wife has a mule we both use for long term storage and to transfer items, but she also only plays casually.
---
Second, using a extra character to hold items or caps is in no way comparable to taking advantage of a character who only requires 360 XP to level up vs a character who takes upwards of 20,000 XP to get that single level. An account can hold no more than 150,000 caps, there’s nothing a mule can do to increase that limit. A similar comparison would be if new characters automatically had items you could sell that would quickly net you the daily 1400 vendor caps.
---
Finally, I am not in this discussion because I’m debating the legitimacy of the tactic of using an alt to get the level up daily finished quickly, I’m here because people repeatedly point to this as justification for leaving in place a predatory system. “Oh it only takes an hour” leads to “ But what if I have to level up a level 300 character,” and the response is always “ just make a level 1 alt and run to the Wayward.” Instead of having a discussion about how Bethesda is taking advantage of players for daily statistics, it turns into justification for forcing players into grinding out challenges daily rather than implementing a consumer friendly system.
---
Not yet. I’m sure they will announce it on official Fallout Twitter or Inside the vault in a day or two. All I know is that we achieved 150k wood for the challenge. There’s actually a tracker on the main Fallout 76 website
---
Would be nice to get into the office that is inaccessible in the whitesprings bunker
---
Do the ones that cause the enemies to explode do damage to other enemies?

You’re welcome bro
---
What about rifles and handmade? Can any of them be a magic weapon?
---
Why drop them when you can make loud boom!
---
You forgot some important perk cards for your build  i added them if you wanna take a look. And you dont to keep pick lock and hacker perk cards equiped man. You lose alot of potential. Think about it !
---

---
Fast traveled into the base im pretty sure he designed it like that
---
Need two for a chance at the diffuser and bear arm weapon plan.
---
But what if they lose all of their health?  Does Demo Expert work with it?  Good point on the Instigating downside, I run knives and swords and while it would kind of suck to lose the advantage of Instigating in mobs it might be fun to use a Ghoul Slayers at the golf club and take them all out in a couple swings.
---
Yes that entrance shaft collapses immediately when Earl dies. I got caught in there once, died and respawned during the last seconds of the fight and was jumping down the shaft.... CRUNCH. No looting Earl or the wendigos!
---
They’re ok if you do them from stealth or where an enemy is caught in place. Explosives were pretty neutered ages ago.
---
I was just trying to buy ammo from his shop
---
Floater Nades are... Bad. No boom. Just sad chunky fire/ice/poison.
---
Stand in the tunnel next to where he spawns. On his right side. If everyone sits in there, he will stay in that location and you don't have to worry about falling debris or toxic puddles.
---
Yeah for sure it’s punishing if you die just at that right time. It is however a specific circumstance though that most players should be able to avoid with some precaution.
---
I do like this new challenge because it's almost like Bethesda listened when we asked for more challenging content that bloodied builds wouldn't just roll over (at least all the time).
---
I die maybe once out of every 4 ACP and never run bloody/adrenal lower than half hp for the duration of event.
---
I also have a rule. Everyone who gets downed gets 1 stimpack pickup from me. No more after that. 
---
Through this, I have noticed that 9 times out of 10, the only people who are downed more than once in any ACP are those below lv 150 (probably first character dudes), or 20% hp bloody builds of any level. 
---
In many ways, Beth has done a great attempt to take bloodied away as the optimal, easy meta for this event. 
---
This event is I think the only one in game that is increasingly challenging for bloodied non PA builds (only if detected, i know... lol) who are going in with minimal hp for maximum buff, while the difficulty remains similar for the vast majority of other builds.
---
Sealant for travel, you've already got a rag wick, you want to keep that rag in place
---
Going in to the dev room won’t get you banned. Taking something out will.
---
Ok that helps
---
Pft, I know it's you Michael.
---
I have accidentally left the mine while the event was still active (wasn't paying close enough attention to which quest marker I was following). It's annoying to find the mine back to being "closed" while the event is active and your teammates are still in there.
---
TBH, though, for me Earle was a one and done. I went in, helped out where I could, got the crap for his kid. Not gonna go back. The lighting is fuck awful, it's hard for me to comprehend what I am seeing/what is going on. SBQ forever.
---
This is the one time I would go with “it just works”
---
I'm really bummed they max at 15 per stat, I really need some extra STR slots
---
2? I know about the one North of the monorail junk pile, where is the second?
---
If you used What Rads on a mutated character that does not have Starched Genes equipped, does it remove that mutation?
---
I can help you launch nukes as well if you want at some point.
---
Sigh. It used to be so much better but its getting harder and harder to find considerate players now.
---
Does that reset outfit spawns too?
---
Having a Rank 4 Legendary Agility perk will give you 5 points of Agility and allow you to equip 5 points worth of Agility perks.
---
Thanks! Ok I’ll let you know!!
---
Honestly, this. Everytime I think I'd like to be able to chat "Hey, I want to take over this power plant, and I hear the quest gives out plans for a large generator/fusion cell generator, anyone in?" or "Anyone want to tag team up on [individual quest]? I am on [step] and happy to get you to there/go with you to your step." I also think "Goodness gracious it's annoying how ubiquitous that is in other games, I'm kind of glad I don't have that option."
---
Though, TBF, I think there's a huge difference between "I am level 20 and my weapons are crap, and the game sent me on a quest in an area with level 62 enemies" vs "I'm new and scared to kill anything by myself," or "I'm new and I don't want to put any effort into levelling up, can someone give me items for free or let me tag along for XP?"
---
I feel it should stay. There are just too many perks/items/camp items that would go to absolute waste if hunger/thirst is to be removed. What I noticed is you get this new legendary perk that let you spawn some stims or something that will make hunger and thirst least of your worries
---
No, it won't remove mutations. But it won't keep you from gaining unwanted mutations either, which is part of the purpose of Starched Genes.
---
We actually are getting those with Daily Ops. One of the datamined rewards.
---
Its really irritating to the point where i just want to kill it and act dumb.
---
Just happened again. This time it was 2 ACP in a row, then an Encryptid, then another ACP.
---
I ignored the first nuke launch. Figured I had to do my daily legendary scripping, effect rolling, housekeeping stuff. 
---
Finished all that. Was just about to get ready for Morgantown high, Top of the World and the aluminum ore in those Ash Heap locations when another nuke popped. 300 aluminum or a ACP roll? I chose ACP.
---
No aluminum after that. Encryptid plus 3rd nuke made sure of it. Ended up buying 10 bulk from a player vendor. I was down to 60 aluminum in the scrapbox -.-
---
thats what i needed, thanks!!
---
It's the equivalent of punching a frag grenade into an enemy's mouth. Will *that* do damage to other enemies?
---
There's this group of people that's demanding welcome mat to work as spawn point  of their camps. Be sure to let them know of your experience. Honestly, I think these people are the ones that do this
---
Person who dv is one ofvem
---
I hit em first and then call the others. Then again, we do too much damage. No legendary should die with 1 or two hits. I'm just getting tired of these bloodied people crying damage nerfs on the PTS should be reverted.
---
Rigged from the start, love it!
---
DETECTIVE!
---
Nope, no scar.
---
Collection might be a temporary solution. Mine helped me restock after I pretty much spent all of my supplies trying to get Monogah's power plant up and running, and then worked to get Poseidon's power plant up and running (twice because I didn't get the plan I really wanted out of the first attempt).
---
All listed for 150+ caps like any one in their right mind would ever pay that much for those things.
---
Short answer - Yes
---
Rifle builds will be playable but rather pointless.  May as well go Commando.
---
My main rifle (Bloodied Pipe Revolver) lost half its damage per shot, really not happy about this.  I have an automatic Gamma Gun that does more per shot now.
---
Also they screwed Stealth builds for the Ops.  Can't use it at all in there but it should still work while killing random stuff.
---
Look at huntersville on the map, you see a road heading south. Follow it to a huge crater. It has a checkpoint and lots of military cars and barricades strewn about, so it seems like that was a military base where they got all the vehicles and stuff in huntersville from. Since no nukes dropped in Appalachia, my theory is either there was a nuclear reactor that exploded, it was purposely destroyed after the war, or perhaps modus had something to do with it but as far as I know there’s no holotapes, notes or terminal entries talking about either crater. Only thing that I’m sure about is that the one north of the monorail elevator happened after the war
---
Take your tag on it before using the emote. That's what I do... Though I haven't had too many negative experiences with people one shotting. It still blows my mind just how many times I've done AWOL and One Violent Night with total strangers and nobody using the mic and we all make sure everyone gets their hit in. Thumbs up and hearts all around at the end. I know there are plenty of a-holes on all platforms... But still,  reputation of being one of the best in-game communities is well deserved.
---
Ya just couldnt wate for the hide to tan. You just had to lay that shit out straight from earl's corpse.
---
Collosal problem has some awesome camp items. My favorite is the trophy by far.
---
How will a perk spawning in stims reduce hunger and thirst? And they aren’t removing hunger and thirst
---
The one that just happened was one violent night. I use a bloodied railway so i unequipped it and ran up to it to punch and it was dead before i got there. There was like 10 people there and i said it over the mic because there was 10 people there.
---
And this is why I hate that we don't have an opt in/out of pvp session, or dedicated servers for pve, pvp, and "anything goes." 
---
Admittedly, I'm more salty about it after running into a griefer earlier today (that jerk was pretty much going around and killing other players for fun. If you want to do that, go play call of duty or Ark Survival). He ruined my workspace just before I could collect from my third junk collector dohickey. If he had waited like 5 more minutes, it wouldn't have bothered me. I had been sitting on that workstation for a few hours, and was starting to feel bad (even though I do leave the resources open for anyone to grab/enjoy). I sort of wish I had destroyed my other work station before server hopping to get away from him.
---
See this is why i love the f76 community on reddit . Thanks for all the suggestions things are dropping so quick now with the few tweaks to my load out. We just got big earl in under 5 minutes. Thanks everyone.   I haven't  even cleaned my mutations yet..
---
It’s actually the opposite of that, the nozzles that give you way more damage are supposed to reduce the range but if you mod the flamer afterwards it goes back to the default range. Relogging just fixes the bug
---
I was running up to punch it because i use a bloodied railway.
---
I just want a hatch in the ground that leads to a decently customizeable empty bunker
---
What I don't understand is why several level 100+ seem so desperate to get a shot in on everything and unload their full auto TSE weapons in situations like Uranium Fever when all 3 of the legendaries are guaranteed to drop under level. I mean, are they having that much trouble getting scrip?
---
No that’s just instinctual fear
---
It used to be no problem, but every time someone acts like a jerk everyone gets more cautious and just assumes someone is going to do it anyways, leading to the exact feeling you’re having now. It’s just a slow snowball effect where only one person needs to be selfish for everyone else to feel like their only chance at getting the kill is to kill first
---
Does ammo factory stack with ammosmith perk?
---
Wait couldn’t you with rank one of the survival shortcut just not eat or drink
---
How do we get the initial rank 1 legendary perk cards?
---
People who play fallout 76 high unite
---
It hurts my soul 😀
---
Or just remove them altogether
---
Not sure if I missed it, but on first reading I don't think it's clear that the first rank of each perk is free (so a level 1 character for a player who has another character at level 300 will be able to have 6 rank 1 legendary perks right away - though obviously upgrading them will take a long time).
---
I think it's the culture in the game. I've had it happen "twice" (the first time, I think I accidentally caused friendly fire, and it didn't occur to me to give the guy killing me the "confused" emoji. I totally get *why* he killed me, so no hard feelings and a lesson about turning on pacifist mode learned). The second time was a griefer who had better weapons than us low levels (me at level 28, a teammate at level 52, and I have no idea what level he killed off to get the "wanted" tag..thisbguy was level 100+). He came at us with a mini gun.
---
Otherwise, I mostly run into people willing to help out low level players. I've since learned a lot of higher levels gift out loot from events most likely because a) it's not what they need, b) they already have all of their scrips for the day, c) it's just extra weight in their inventory/stash.
---
I sell stuff in my vendor shop mostly to get rid of it/get it out of my inventory. I'm close enough to vault 76 that new characters or alt characters can stock up on items for dirt cheap (I sell everything for 1 cap, regardless of what it is because I'd like to help people... I imagine others come by and buy up some of the items worth more to stock up their own shops and make more caps, and that's fine, too. It's no longer in my stash and thus no longer my problem).
---
For the most part, folks are extremely helpful and team oriented in this game.
---
Insufficient Charisma
---
As one of the few people who doesnt run a bloody/unyielding build, I feel obligated to take What Rads? and make it useful.  I wonder if +300 Rad resist with full Secret Service armor and -6 rads a second is enough to be in a nuke zone without needing power armor or the stealth armor.
---
24 hour grind
---
Does Auto Unlock with master infiltrator mean you don’t have to hack or pick it yourself? If so is there a cool down on it?
---
I did say 'stims' which might have caused some confusion. This perk spawn chems every 20 minutes or something that fully restore hunger/thirst and cure disease. So you don't have to worry about foods or drinks no more
---
I think it's important to mention that you always start with rank 1 of the legendary cards and most provide diminishing returns when leveled up, I think many people are way too focused on getting these cards max rank when there isn't all that much gain.
---
hmm dont have the rug but maybe it can be used along with mothman/cult or raider stuff to bloody up your camp
---
Rocks can sometimes bleed when you shoot them.
---
Well you have to do some amount of damage like you tag SBQ. Just punching for once won't get you the loot most of the time.
---
So do the heads on the head display, trophy thing. Are Wendigos supposed to be legitimately un-dead now?
---
I did one today and somebody glitched themselves into the boss room before the mine was opened and killed him. Since they killed him before the mine was open it didn’t complete the event so nobody got anything at all from it.
---
Yeah agreed big time.  The amount of QoL perks in strength is the problem.
---
That doesn’t make sense though. As when modded the standard barrel has notably less range then the long barrel. This is taking into consideration the effects of the three different nozzles also. For example if you have the standard nozzle equiped with a long barrel, the range will still be broken when loading back into the game and will require you to re-mod the barrel to fix. The issue still stands.
---
Plans, recipes, and ammo. These days I am specifically hunting for 5mm or .44 ammo.
---
For plans, I am looking for the ability to craft my own weapons. Decorating isn't high on my "to do" list (I have a real life house for that, TBH). Recipes, I look to see what is out there. I have no real goal in mind.
---
I won't destroy your stuff if you're overpriced, or don't have anything good, though. I sell for the same reason you do: to get rid of extra stuff.
---
Damn it, were the raider quests more fun than foundation? They're quests bored the fuck out of me so I opted to skip the raider ones thinking it'd be more of the same fetch quest garbage without interesting characters or stories.
---
Tell you what, let's make a deal.  If you keep using the follow me emote for legendary enemies, so will I.  Fuck all the stupid, selfish, lazy people.  We'll make the world a better place one Uranium Fever at a time.
---
Fair enough, the way it's worded it was like bloody mess and they just explored to a pile of bloody chunklets.
---
Maybe the smaller events legendarys should just drop them for everyone. Excluding sbq the new event and encrptid
---
Lmao. You got yourself a deal
---
And you learned this how? did the big bad rug scare you? hahahaha
---
and thank you I will go home and try this out
---
Pacifist mode just means you can't harm them, not the other way around.
---
Are all legendary perk cards (Lvl 1) unlocked at the start, and we only need to spend 50 coins to get to level 2 of any one legendary perk card “tree” so to speak?
---
Or do we need to spend coins as well to get the Lvl 1 of a legendary card too.
---
How about actual artillery pieces.
---
Even imposter sheepsquatch is getting oneshotted nowadays. We srsly need damage nerf
---
Does pacifist mode help for this? My understanding is it means you can't do damage to other players, not the other way around...
---
This just gave me mitten squad flashbacks
---
Yeah it is. Sucks and you wont stop anyone from doing it
---
 Can you have another drug effect when you have taken super Chen mk1 ? Does it stack with other drugs ?
---
Once, for no real reason I just found a level 5 and dropped a fully customized 10mm with like.. 200 spare rounds.
---
Mostly because I had no real use for the ammo.
---
Felt nice.
---
Mmm... Can you, though? Rose's storyline is part of the main story, and you get roped into Signal Strength when following the Overseer's path. I needed help with both of those due to lack of good weapons, and saving up perk points for end game.
---
I do enjoy dropping a bunch of stuff next to new players then fast traveling away before they can thank me.  It's weird, I know, but really satisfying.
---
The #1 thing Bethesda could do that'll be best of two worlds: Increase the time it takes for how long Food/Thirst meters to go down: -50% within 2 hours / -100% (Starving/Dehydrated) within 2 more hours. 
---
Gives you up to 4 real hours without really having to worry about it.
---
Plus if i remember correctly that's exactly how Fallout 4's Survival Mode handled it as well.
---
Ah yes. Followed by an almost too realistic post orgasmic-like groan.
---
I am on PS4 but its an Atom Shop item so you cant drop it
---
He takes abit to give the quest and turn in I just spam X till it starts takes 1-2 min sometimes. Try to keep extra drinks on you to when do it had a few finish straight away
---
It acts as one more obstacle for some NPCs to break before they get to the next obstacle. They can't break foundations, for what it's worth. I use the ramp foundations and make them face outward so that the taller end faces the NPCs. It gives them less to break.
---
I have the plan. Can't find it in my build menu. Help?
---
Where you land collapses and spills out a little. It is a great place to hold him until he gets low then move out and away.
---
Are you on PC?
---
I think you are right about this and not only because it can make you feel good, but it’s helping to grow the community and cause a lot of them to do the same when and if they have the means later.
---
5 months? I've spammed on his hiccuping self for 20 mins straight before lol, dude just acts like I don't exist and continues singing his "99 bottles" jingle
---
You can afford to miss a week or two in total honestly. This season missed about three days, hit rank 100 last Tuesday. So adding that up so far it's been 11 days lol.
---
Same
---
So by putting the ramp foundations out in front of a fence it would force the NPCs down a specific attack path?
---
Happy cake day pal!
---
The ones in the back be pushing the poor idiot with a stick to the front. They actually programmed natural selection into this game.
---
I know the spoilers, actually, and I am excited to get to that point. For me, spoilers are what allow me to really enjoy a game/television show/movie during the moment. Otherwise, I spend too much time wondering/worrying about what is next that I don't truly enjoy the moment I am in.
---
I hope I'll still find the game fun when my character is able to get to that point. Right now, the excitement I have to get to experience that lore is outweighing the things I dislike about the game, ways the game sometimes bores me, and the ways I find the game frustrating. I am currently really holding onto the excitement for that part of the game, and what follows after getting all of the lore :)
---
I managed to survive Big Bend Tunnel West around Level 35, feeling pretty badass about myself. Thought I’d have a look around the Cranberry Bog, because, you know – Cranberries. Hit NAR Repair Yard and its high-level Supermutants – oh boy! If only I could make it to that city not too far away! The best thing about those Assaultrons kicking my arse is that I didn’t lose any ammo in a drawn out grudge match. I did lose my loot from Big Bend, but I didn’t care. I just ended up thinking ‘maybe this game is just too hard for me’.
---
It sounds like you can scrap all six cards with the minimum rank Master Infiltrator Perk.  The extra ranks just allow you to unlock the lock or computer automatically.
---
So does that make Todd 'Dear old Dad'? Lol very cool with the character.
---
I’m interested in the Gat. Which platform?
---
Lol beautiful! If they ever put in Nick Valentines jacket i was actually thinking of making a Constantine
---
I think helping them through stuff is better.  They were having trouble with mayor for a day, so I helped kill the robots for them.  That way it's not just them getting a bunch of stuff without at least par8also appreciating the game itself.
---
Just pick them up as that other person said and yes within the last month
---
In the trailer at the West Tech front entrance.
---
Thanks! I actually didn't realize until I posted haha.
---
It was in fo4, It was something like how many animals, robots, humans you killed
---
Foundations can't be destroyed, but NPCs will attack the first camp object they come across. I put a bunch of ramp foundations up so that they just waste time trying to break the foundations while my turrets kill them. Enclose your camp in foundations rather than a wall, and they won't be able to destroy your main camp.
---
Oh man that's a great idea!
---
Yes, he's ruining pvp because he hates when we fight.  ;)
---
This would be so awesome. Just picturing some guest hearing my artillery as he is buying something is just great. I also wish they buffed other explosives in general, idk why but they feel a little less like a joke since 2 weeks ago, not sure if it's just me, but still, they could use more power, same for bash damage as many say
---
Holy shit it works. Dude you're the best.
---
Thank you! And great job! Happy cake day!
---
It’s because day night passes by so much faster than real life it does seem annoying. But I’m a heavy food build so I never really get the negative part. Stay obese people, stay obese.
---
It does not stack, from what has been reported. I'll update the post to clarify that.
---
I don’t know why people complain about the water food thing. Get some industrial purifiers and plant a bunch of corn. I make 60 corn soup that last for like 4 hours and regens ap. Easy peasy......takes two minutes to craft.
---
Rank 1 is free. You just need to have the Slot unlocked to place it.
---
Had 3 lvl 2's follow me to overseer camp, and then they each got 1k steel, 20 lead, 20 aluminum a piece, full set of customized armor, fully customized melee and ballistic weapons. Also got them a bunch of aid. Area chat was going crazy today. Feels good to help the low lvls out.
---
I live on a cliff and have a firework show every night. Way easier than dropping.
---
Let me check my stash, I have a three star medics handmade. Will check the other stars.
---
The Legendary SPECIAL, Chem-giving and What Rads? perks are the opposite of "diminishing." They become exponentially more powerful.
---
It’s how I sleep after too many drinks so I just pretend my character is the same way.
---
Got it, thank you. So if I have one lvl 300 character, I can log into my alt and have 6 level 1 legendary perk cards equipped at once theoretically.
---
You're given a prompt that immediately unlocks the object, no minigame required.
---
It’s just a power nap, ain’t got time for no fancy linen!
---
Whenever I remember, I try to give anyone below level 100 a couple free stimpack diffusers to help with the tadpole challenge. The things are cheap to craft, aside from the super stim, and borderline useless since they don’t operate like friendly fire, so why shouldn’t I give them away?
---
Though do sell for quite a bit, though.
---
Yes.
---
I sell almost everything for 1 cap..including aid. I just want the shit gone.
---
Alot if these perks are ass and none of  them are worth the grind. Smh I was hyped for heavy duty and they removed it. That seemed like the only real legendary perk.
---
.38 and .44 ammo... Always leaving 1 k of each at the overseers cache near starter zone. Wish I could throw some .38 into my Gatling gun...
---
Rank 1 is free, you just need an open slot. I updated the post.
---
Wouldn't wax work?
---
he even donated his own clothes. what dedication to the cause
---
You think we should tell Maggie he might not be dead lol poor guy
---
Those Armor perks basically removed the major benefit to Power Armor, so I can understand why they were removed.
---
. . . Now I am just picturing a Fallout character acting like a character from the SIMS and spinning around to suddenly be in their underwear and then getting carefully into bed.
---
Heh I remember one asked me where he could find leather, went to stash and dropped 2 k leather. That stuff drops like rain..that and steel.
---
Tested it, everyone can see the same stuff. I always leave a full armor, weapon set in there along with mats.
---
Where was your base?
---
People are upset because this system effectively disincentivizes you to play several characters.
---
Spreading your playtime among several characters instead of playing just one all the way will put you at even worse disadvantage once this system will hit the live servers in its current state. Grinding full set of upgraded perks for each character would be an utter chore only few will resort to. Others will just put their lower level chars on a shelf since it's gonna be too much considering how many other stuff they already need to grind with all this rep/gold/plan bullsh*t.
---
It'd be really great if all chars would contribute to coin gain with their xp counting towards an *account-wide xp-pool*, which in turn would govern how many coins you would have to spend on *account-wide perk upgrades*, which any character would be able to use afterwards.
---
Does legendary SPECIAL cards increase the corresponding special like it would if you allocate a point there (so you can equip more cards perhaps)?
---
Because spawn points at a players camp is more or less random (and it's a good thing, or sometimes you'd spawn on top of stacked punji or a button of death) you can sometimes spawn behind a locked door. 
---
Many players lock their doors for various reasons. You can always fast travel to a free location such as your own camp or Vault 76 to get out (if you have no caps), or try fast traveling on the location you are at, as sometimes that will load you elsewhere in the camp area..
---
Would be a lot easier with text chat. I make level 15 raider power armor fully modded, and sometimes i'll find a low level to drop it but they haven't a clue what i'm trying to do.
---
They should be able to ... or, well, *technically* it should be possible to restrict how fast each plant grows, or even how many you could have in a camp. They sure are adept at restricting currencies, at the very least; it just makes no sense that several things can apparently grow in the wilderness, but can't be cultivated in an actual garden.
---
Just after wastelanders hit, I brought up a player from free trial (think I added him here from r/fo76), to him purchasing the game, to getting to lv 70 with heavy guns and PA. Ran with him a few times a week and showed him the ropes, always on a level appropriate character. 
---
Then I took a small break since I was waiting for legendary run update, and when I returned, I havent seem him since. :( 
---
The experience was really awesome endgame stuff/content tbh...
---
If you have any of the Survival Syringes in your inventory and remove the Survival Shortcut perk you keep the Syringes and they're still usable. I didn't test this with the Brawling Chemist perk but I'm assuming that it works the same way.
---
Are there any modern MMOs where text chat isn't dead or toxic? Sincere question.
---
Oops. Xbox
---
Reminds me of the Han Solo in carbonite-like object on a ceiling in the roof of the Disciples base in Fallout 4 Nuka-World in the sense that if you shoot it it bleeds.
---
Never gonna happen, they're too chickenshit.
---
In a day or to if they do it the same as the last stuff
---
The event in general has a surprisingly high level of effort put into it relative to the rest of the game.
---
So if we combine them, can we build our own Earl as a pet to guard our camps?
---
I can’t wait to fight in this fatigue
---
Man, I needed someone like you a year ago. Those damn challenges!
---
Yes, I believe it still grants a very small amount of rep, but it is still going to be a horrible grind.  I'm not a fan of taking advantages of game glitches, but you might consider using the Raider rep glitch that's out there.  You can Google it easily.  Honestly, the faction rep grind is a bit over the top grindy.
---
Thanks for writing this! 
---
Can you explain a little more how follow through works on a boss? Does the dmg boost apply to others? If I continually sneak hit does the timer reset every hit?
---
I've started tossing a grenade into Ward's trailer every night after completing his daily, that's a good use for them.
---
Someone probably asked this already, but am I right in thinking when you equip the legendary Strength card it adds to your total SPECIAL? So for arguements sake you had 3 points in Strength then are able to add an additional 3 to strength through the legendary perk taking your SPECIAL to 6 that you can then pick another level 3 card in strength?
---
Awww man, they got rid of the bonus coins for holographic cards? Was hoping they'd keep that so I could get something more substantial for my 4 max rank Gold Butcher's Bounty's.
---
Apparently bloody mess has a low percentage chance to explore nearby enemies.
---
Yes, everytime you complete it you get some rep. Also, be sure to also give Blackeye Queen Mirelurk meat everyday. I got a lot of rep doing this. Just know, in my experience,  you can't  get the quest loop everytime. I had to jump servers to get it to work consistently.
---
I'm only at level 105 with an average lever action sneak build, but very few enemies take more than one or two shots.
---
What enemy is even alive for 30 seconds to make Follow Through useful?
---
It is really just a card for bosses. Then I ask myself if I will want to level up a card that only has situational usefulness compared to SPECIAL perks and choosing something that is always helping out.
---
I run a heavy food build with strong back, travelling pharmarcy, pack rat, bandolier, and thru-hiker. I'm a hoarder and I need that weight reduction.
---
5 more points in ECIL will let me grab Ironclad, Bodyguards, Demo Expert (if I ever get a good explosive gun), and Serendipity.
---
For me, those would be changes that would always help out. Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw might be other quality of life perks that resonate with my foodie lifestyle.
---
I'll probably get Follow Through for the initial boost since it is better than tenderizer, but it would absolutely be the last legendary perk I try to upgrade. Like you said, Ammo Factory and Funky Duds are the only other ones that look compelling.
---
If we are honest, they probably need to rework these, right?
---
If everyone ends up using the SPECIAL legendary perks, it means they failed to balance them.
---
Shouldn't there be a unique legendary perk for each weapon type (pistols, shotguns, rifles, automatic...etc)?
---
I don't know why they removed the armor ones, but I would think unique armor perks make sense too.
---
200 should be 4 slots unlocked, no?
---
yep
---
Hi, I'll purchase the Gatling plasma on Xbox later on today. Send me a message - Big Keebes

Bethesda will listen and take one word: gates. Then add more time gates. Cap gates. All the shitty F2P mobile game tactics to make you keep playing. And as for logic, do you really think they’re capable of that? If Bethesda knew the first thing about logic, Fallout 4 wouldn’t happen. The Institute would have been capable of destroying everyone that opposes them. The Railroad literally had a fucking red line pointing to the building with their main HQ, protected by half a dozen ferals, a single brick wall, and contains the five most important people to the Railroad. The Brotherhood of Steel would be taken down - it’s not hard to replace Brotherhood soldiers if you subdue or even eliminate a squad to replace them with synths and use them to destroy the Prydwen. And the Minutemen? Well, if they become a threat, eliminating you wouldn’t be hard. Even a god can be killed with enough numbers.
---
I seriously  wanted to see the supernatural version more
---
Voice works too
---
He doesn't get it...possibly a Freudian slip?
---
Where did the logo pop up?
---
Are you talking about the runaway raider daily where you bail out of dialogue?
---
def down for doing a few rounds of this event i want to get the bear arm/mods, same goes for free range i want the staff super bad
---
I wish Legendaries weren't level restricted, or something. It'd be cool to give a one star legendary minor weapon to a relative newbie. They could rock it for ten levels or so.
---
Sometimes when I come across a new player, I'll try to get their attention and drop them a variety of things, almost like a starting kit(typically includes stims, radx, radaway, some bobby pins, a variety of scrap, a weapon or two, maybe some armor, ammo, and a hefty amount of purified water). Last time was not too long ago when I needed a fast travel point. I joined a public team and a level 70ish was giving stuff/advice to his level 15 friend. Popped right over and more or less started throwing stuff at him haha
---
That's what I do but it doesn't even look like the bar moves majority of the time
---
No worries. Don’t take that link as gospel it’s just one take on the build. Read around a bit and play with your build to work out what matters to you :) and have fun!
---
Did the emote at project paradise, got killed, people took my loot bag so I couldn't even find tge spot to retrieve the legendary. 
---
That was cold, man.
---
I was gunna donate wood but then I got high..... I was gunna Fortify Atlas like I should but then I got high..... We got the Steel Dawn Army Fatigues anyways and I know why.... becuase I got high, becuase I got high, becuase I got high.
---
I almost never see anyone use it or sell it in vendors. What I would recommend doing for your 3 tadpole challenges would be archer, athlete, and hunter. I believe swimmer is another one of the easier ones too but you'll need to revive someone in water I think.
---
Archer and athlete are probably the easist IMO. Hunter can be a bit tougher because you have to search for each of the animals and kill a yao guai with a syringer. On the good side, I know a syringer with the bleedout mod counts towards the challenge.
---
edit: if you're just working on gathering badges, there's not really anything worthwhile using tadpole badges. Possum badges on the other hand are mainly for backpack mods. There's a chance of getting them from the pioneer scout dailies as well as from the "campfire tales" event.
---
That part of the challenge may even be bugged. I’ve used three and it still hasn’t ticked off
---
My flamer just won't do damage to the scorchbeast queen. I am hitting her but it only registars it when its perfectly placed on her head. Don't know what that's about. Sucks to hear about the range because mine feels short too
---
Me and my buddy always run this on PS4. I don't understand why people don't head to it every time.
---
Now this sounds like a fun past time.
---
I think the issue you’re having with the queen is linked to the broken range. As you must be right under her head for the flame to reach her, a flamer with fixed range should perform better.
---
pretty sure it doesn’t, even with the exploit it takes hundreds of turn ins of a quest that supposedly awards 200 reputation
---
Not that I know of. And the GamePass kiddies will ruin that just like they’ve ruined everything else in this game. It’s gotten a hell of a lot more toxic since it got released on GamePass.
---
Just give them a lower level weapon.
---
super mutants now realise that this IS the milk of human kindness
---
Shut up Meg
---
"You only just left the vault now? What have you been doing all this time?!?"
---
*Pew pew pew
---
Good. Anyone who sells mounted head plans deserves to burn in Hell.
---
Use the glitch for Daily Retirement Plan.
---
Take over a workshop and see how many things you can blueprint and deploy at your CAMP
---
But how many flamingoes does it take up?
---
Can you please not take a Tesla in acp
---
She is portrayed as pretty tough though, she was nearly killed around the mountainside bed and breakfast area, but ends up at the silos anyway. Not that she did anything with them lol.
---
Yeah that was the other example I was gonna use especially if they are low level and might need help with a quest
---
Ok
---
I have legacies and generic BE weapons. In my experience, bloodied, no fireproof, (I use dense, because wtf are you if you don’t) I take minimal damage if I use a generic BE weapon. 
---
On the other hand, if i use a legacy explosive, it is very easy to kill myself in the fashion you describe or accidentally shooting a trashcan or pillar. However, the fashion you describe implies that there are other players near you. This suggests that you are in a public event. Using a legacy weapon in a public event with people around means you are a shitty and selfish person deleting NPC’s without letting other people tag. Therefore, I don’t give a fuck about you and your character.
---
I find if I store them, replace them, then fast travel away they work. But I believe only I get to see them. My buddy came over after I had done it and they were broken for him and working for me lol
---
I get this alot from the newer players, demanding weapons and ammo, I help people if they either ask nicely or dont ask at all but clearly need it. The entitled ones get spoiled food and a you have been insulted
---
Add me ign: ZuccGivethSucc and I can finish that set for you
---
If I got locked in I'd get nakie and lie on their bed with a Bog Wanderer mask on..... Something positively chilling....
---
Shout out to you mountain builder types- learn to site a camp. If I'm falling to my death you most likely are too.
---
Just wanted to point out that it has been confirmed via datamining that these briefcases spawn due to a bug, and exploiting a bug is an exploit.
---
I'm not using legacies in meat week or anything, I'm using them in events that need them. Such as when dealing with Earle.
---
I got a super duper proc off of the uplink for roses/Madigan quest that I thought was neat. Couldn't display it though:/
---
ACP (the event) rewards a guaranteed 3* legendary.
---
Yeah, I once traded with someone who requested my JE laser, BE gatling plasma, B2525 fixer, BE25 flamer, tattered field jacket, responder fireman outfit and helmet, forest camo jumpsuit and scout mask like please, I'm never gonna give you a legacy for caps. Thats when I want a middle finger emote
---
I remember the time when i've had the pleasure of witnessing similar fight just few hundreds feet away from my camp. Sups were trying to gang big ram down with FREAKING BOARDS, so i laughed hard and spilled my tea.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just for that, they all were rewarded with plasma shots.
---
That's... that's not the point.
---
The perfect picture describing how I’ll feel tommorow.
---
When the damage nerfs come in, you might find a lot more enemies take more than a shot or two.
---
Ew
---
Time to settle in a nice rocker in front of the fire place, turn on some tunes, grab some potato crisps and sugar bombs, and a nice big bowl of my hydroponic irradiated thistle.
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Making mobs blow up really suck and sounds lazy
---
Hahaha fr 😂
---
A better system would just not have it cost anything to swap it. Same issue as builds. It's easier to make a new character with a new build than spend 50 levels moving points around. Not even freemium games are that dim. It really would be the best qol improvement being able to respec either for free, some caps or 1 level point at most.
---
I mean, it's nice to level up your gear, it would be less fun if you could just use the best weapons right away.
---
I never completed the Medic badge, actually bought the diffusers from someone, but never have used them. 
---
I actually had a thought about the Tadpole badges tonight. I was doing one of Raider Punk's daily quests, and it was 'Go Squash Vengeful Mothman'. I thought to myself, these Wasterlanders players, have it so easy! Before Wastelanders, you had to go scour the freaking map to find a Mothman!
---
Haha just to continue this discussion from the other night, I would suggest this: i don't recall the last time during a prewar fallout scenario where it would be likely the president would be captured, much less made to do anything.
---
Theoretically this would mean the command officer of a nuclear silo somehow capturing a president (which would be required for the codes in fo76, as we're not talking real life) and convincing his crew, either human or robots or a mix, to set up the process before getting prez to give codes.
---
I dont think any move to make the prez a hostage would go unnoticed, and if it did, then yeah, such was how many things went down in the fallout universe.
---
As for the scorched officers, that's going to be more paragraphs but I think it's safe to say one general would not be able to easily convince all code carriers to fail their only job.
---
Totally fair point, but do you think the time to kill on normal mobs will be increased so much as to make Follow Through a good legendary perk?
---
Ah I see. Thatll be cool
---
One wasteland is going to nerf this. You won't be able to get higher xp for the higher level enemies. Running around whitespring with a low level friend to ppwer level them was fun.
---
Thats what i was worried about. I didn't know if it'd be like a large blank interior where we would build a house or something. Thinking like foundation in halo 3 forge mode
---
I mean yeah?
---
Right beside grafton dam i have water purifiers set up for caps
---
How do you drop PA, I have a set I want to give away.
---
Had to downvote to hit 69 for your score. Sorry.
---
Actually, it doesn't. In ACP, I routinely use one to mow down literal mobs of wendigo spawns that NO ONE else pays attention to, as they only care about putting shots into Earl. 80% of the time I end up being the only person of 8 that does it, and I save someone running and gunning Earl, while getting their ass eaten by 7 Wendigos nearly every time they spawn. I don't use it to 'melt' bosses, I switch to other weapons to put in shots on bosses. If others are actually helping with the spawns, I won't use it. And I occasionally run into the idiot low level that panics and drags a town towards me, or right in front of me while firing, and its instant death for me. So please, explain how that makes me a shitty and selfish person.
---
Definitely not one of the usual nuke areas. Yeah, was probably intentional. Sorry to hear what happened to you :(
---
I think that's exactly the idea, although given the prevalence of food and drink in the game, I'm not sure if it's really worth it in comparison to some of the other options (unless you really, really hate gathering stuff).
---
How do you people get messages? Is it even possible?
---
It does work, it's a pain in the rear, but it works. I used that the other day to finish of my Raider Ally for the last time ever. I must have done about 25 server hops to finally finish off the rep, but it did eventually get to where I could tell it was moving.
---
 Out of 5 characters, I brought two of them to full ally with both factions, and never again. I guess the other 3 are just going to be rogues.
---
I thought this was public knowledge already.
---
Yeah, it's the first time it has been forced to drop as a 3-star.
---
Xbox you can just select the player from the map than select "message player" to send an xbox message directly to them.
---
No, apparently not. Been hearing a lot of debate about it.
---
No. Proccing Super Duper is not possible. But you got a badass bug to happen.
---
&gt;wtf are you if you don’t
---
A power armor build.
---
&gt;Using a legacy weapon in a public event with people around means you are a shitty and selfish person deleting NPC’s without letting other people tag.
---
As OP said, using legacies in ACP is beneficial, and given Earl is a fucking bullet sponge, everyone can tag him.
---
&gt;I don’t give a fuck about you and your character.
---
Salty much?
---
Upvoting for awareness! I didn't know this. Thanks!
---
I had a level 2 literally yelling at me during meat week to give him some loot. I did the gift emote, dropped some spoiled meat, the "your the dumbass" note and proceeded to watch in enjoyment. He ran off afterward
---
The legendary SPECIAL ones definitely seem to be the most overall robust. More SPECIAL stats is always nice, but the real value is extra perk points.
---
In comparison, something like Survival Shortcut is neat, but finding food and water is easy, and is often a side effect of consuming food for the special effects it provides.
---
Oh yes, finally... An appropriate use for "you have been insulted"!!! 😂😂
---
Reddit Moment
---
This 100% my legacy does nothing to earle but it melts the mobs and most ignore them until its too late. Dropping wendigos while they drop earle is the lords work.
---
Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter came before Wastelanders. And you actually get 80 Atoms for 7600 Wood, because there are rewards at 76, 760 and 7600. And as you just mentioned: You get 2000 Atoms for free when doing the Legendary Run. At what point is it you that's getting greedy, and not Bethesda?
---
You can also add that ammo factory stacks with ammosmith perk. It's been proven working on pts already. (I even provided some screens with enormous ammo amounts)
---
You have to finish tadpole quest line to get the possum badges from campfire tales
---
My only question is... With the card buy system how do they account for the 100 levels I've spent swapping points to keep myself interested in the game trying new builds. I haven't seen any real answer to this other than, gg fu.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Salt is also both useful for crafting xp boost food and for cheeky player interactions:)
---
Me*
---
-For the title
---
Holy hell that the potienal for builds with that
---
Aww man the cap really bothers me -- well at least I can get 5\* demo expert or gunsmith to swap around for my build, don't really need anything else, well maybe 3\* inspirational
---
I only use my legacies in earl or sbq when I see that the event may fail or if it looks like the other players at the event aren’t doing enough dmg to complete the event. 
---
I stopped having hope that other players have any sense of their surroundings and have fully embraced the fact that many of them just run around with blinders on... much like real life!
---
Earle every time
---
Oh any of the closed off residential spaces along the ghoul strip or other places that have hand scanners :(
---
Yup
---
Is there a cool down between uses or can you use it as many times in a row you want?
---
Straight up.
---
I'm on XB and I always do that event. Actually completed it tonight with another player, again...still can't get enough peeps to keep more than just the bear or deathclaw alive.
---
I've had the same rando message me a few times. The first was, ""got any 50cal ammo? " then, "can you repair this?" followed shortly by "so?"
---
He was level 60. I just ignored him. I'm happy to help people out but just bluntly asking with no please or anything rubs me wrong.
---
All I get is cursed crap. I mean, what a sales pitch.
---
Thank you for taking the time out of your day to answer such a dumb question😂
---
Thanks! Sorry for the dumb question😂
---
Lol no problem, the receiver you'll be looking for is the powerful automatic receiver
---
This is what I run and I swap in cards for repairs, hacking, locks and weight reduction when needed
---

---
I assume I should just scrap a bunch until I get the mod?
---
I’m totally uncivilized and do that in real life. So the game is immersive af for me.
---
Although I do admit my momma taught me to at least take my shoes off
---
What happened to Antivenom? Did that just become Funky Duds? I cant keep track of the changes well lol
---
Ummmmm.... maybe? (he says, not wanting to get Todd-perma-banned)
---
Yes but don't scrap fixers!  Scrap combat rifles, that's where you'll get fixer mods as the fixer is a combat rifle variant
---
If you head over to the market sub you'll easily find them for 250-300c each. There's even a gal who sells them at 50c each of she sees ya
---
Oh ok thank you! Sorry I've never been much of a fixer user.
---
Not a problem glad to help 👍
---
Remember that the Perk Loadouts in winter 2020 might mean you can switch to the lockpick/hacker skills anyway. Just in case that helps you save a Legendary Perk elsewhere.
---
They're not great, but they're essentially 5-star legendaries. The 3 legendary effects you can see, plus +15% damage and +20% faster fire rate/swing speed.
---
Well that sucks. That means that I won't get more XP for killing a high level enemy even if I did it all by myself (and it took 5 minutes and hundreds of rounds)?
---
Stealth throw them at noobs and watch them panic when they hear the noises!
---
I just hate the amount of grinding the game already has in it and even though it’s not much of a grind it’s annoying to have to worry about my ammo, weapon/armour conditions and cooking food/gathering water I feel the Chem will make it way easier with reducing the weight and giving me more time to play the game and doing more activities like doing daily ops with my friends instead of grinding for spices and salt just to cook something that’ll last me a whole 30 minutes of food
---
Ahh okay, makes sense. I never use scopes
---
No doubt, doesn't mean dupers haven't duped the crap out of every mat for this event lol.
---
Nope, any Level ups you've used on reallocating SPECIAL points is completely wasted on this new system.
---
If it takes one shot less to kill each enemy when there's a bunch of enemies around is it worth it to you? I think I might say yes to that. 
---
I'm not on the PTS so I really don't know how this stuff is going to shake out. I'm probably just going to leave a slot open on my stealth commando initially to get a feel for things.
---
I feel like if you have just walked all over the wastes doing very physically demanding work all day you could just slump onto your nice vault-tec bed and pass out
---
I haven’t even seen a paddle ball in the entire time I’ve played the game..:
---
Either way, nice work man!
---
I figured that went without saying, because why wouldn't it?
---
Game runs like a turd... every aspect is bugged. This is not open for debate, it's fact. Even the Atom shop updates, every single one has been bugged since i got back. I'm resting over 1400 hours... don't tell me this game isn't a mess and QoL garbage is more important than performance and stability because it's false.
---
Yeah.... But I can't be a cool kid using a shovel.
---
Unless I make a new character called 'Gravedigger'. He must have cannibal perk.... And the night perks....
---
Hmm.... I might be on to something.
---
150M, that's a lot of wood. O:
---
You can get it with Mr. Fuzzy tokens in the camden park reward terminal thing. It doesn't drop legendary or anything but it is still missing that  keyword so I thought it would be fun to point out.
---
Why would I need a market if I can just have the weapon I wanted crafted for me?
---
Yeah... I have to wonder who would take the time to get one. Far as I know they’re fucking trash.
---
I've you've served in the military and are at basic training, it's the ultimate bigballs act to sleep on your made bed... Or even sit on it... Maybe these characters are expecting revellie at 0600 and can't be fucked making their beds.
---
They'll never completely remove duping, it seems, from this engine. So fast travel bug. Trade bug. Invincible frozen enemy bug. Magic weapons. Issue where you can grab something random from inventory if clicking too quickly repeatedly. Lag when accessing large inventories. Not placing us in servers where our camps can't be placed. Theres too many!
---
But in all honestly, fallout 76 is great. They can take their time and i generally trust them to make good decisions about where to place their labour hours.
---
I don’t really care about the bugs as much as I care about content. I don’t encounter a lot of the bugs because the game doesn’t have anything for me to do to keep me playing long enough to find a bug but the real annoying ones are the ones that mess with the actual game not just visual bugs like the auto complete bug or the Earle just no-clipping into the roof and mocking us .
---
Because this is Bethesda, I guess. Crucial and most obvious mechanics might not work as intended or even exist at all and it happens more often than not unfortunately. Thankfully, this one works (for now at least).
---
If anyone questions the awesomeness of your shovel, plant it firmly in their face so that they can evaluate it up close. Bonus: it makes an amazing sound!
---
Also for the backpack itself if I remember correctly
---
That's too bad. I think the game is fun. I just want to spend more time playing instead of managing my inventory. I can do that at work.
---
Same man after I finished it I stopped playing I just started to come back for a day or two to deliver cloth n wood but other than that games very bland for a lot of people myself included
---
Nothing like getting a buzz on with the settler forager at my camp before I head off into the wilderness
---
*Flashbacks of GTA San Andreas in Whetstone with the hillbillies....*
---
ah man, I thought I was first.
---
I wish I had thought of that. If it ever happens to me again I'll do it. Thanks for the idea.
---
The only one that really bothers me is the trade glitch. And the auto complete bug also really sucks
---
Huh, never played this game station. Good to know!
---
Because, hell, why would it exist in the first place...
---
Ah a simple answer, what you do is
---
what do you mean, "you people"?
---
Slightly grumpy perk coins aren’t shared, given I levelled an alt to get more coins. Also disappointed the armour perks didn’t make it to the final game.
---
30% less damage isn’t as good as power armour, but would still be a big buff to armour (which is very squishy, even in a full suit of SS!)
---
That's understandable, although I've personally found that the Herbivore mutation alongside a small farm and some basic cooking more or less removes any issues. You can easily make various vegetable soups that will restore food, water, and give a variety of buffs, as well as just eating whatever plants you find while wandering around without having to worry about diseases.
---
Survival Shortcut should definitely allow you to just completely ignore the need to collect any food, drink, or disease cures, though, so it should hopefully be what you're looking for.
---
Maybe you're out of crafting materials. Or maybe you ran out of ammo in your last fight and now you need stimpaks and more ammo. Someone could be selling the exact thing you want for much cheaper than the cost of crafting, but they're on an entirely different server. If we could sell while offline or in another server, it would increase the frequency of trade.
---
The only gripe I have is when I'm plugging some bastard with .45 rounds from stealth and the health just goes back up. I lose half a mag to what should have been two shots.
---
If I spend half the game creeping like a paedophile around the playground, I expect my damage to be relevant and not be magically regenerated. I've paid a price in movement speed for precise, and high value shots.
---
DETECTIVE!!
---
*in the background*
---
"All these nightmares. Floating in space..."
---
Just have to wait until post L50 to complete it.  Better rewards, and You’ll have buily up better weapons by the time you need to go there.
---
Oh i know but having 'Master Inflitrator' either way it will save me 6 Perk points that'll be useful elsewhere.
---
Regardless i thank you for reminding me about the Perk Loadouts.
---
Hey congrats!
---
That would be good for me because I get a lot of food/water removing diseases so I would burn through food like no ones business
---
All of wastelanders also deincentivizes playing multiple characters.  Whatever the inevitable currency or reputation grind will be will deincentivize it further unless it's account wide.  I would personally just pick a dude and consider the others gone at this point, unless you do nothing but play 76 all day.
---
Ok, Bethesda PR damage control employee.
---
If it bleeds we can kill it
---
Save all sort settings  in pip boy menus ,  so that when  re-enter the game they are kept  .Мake visible regular armor  parts when use power armor. Chat option.  Мarking option to show others player interesting  items . Remove the idiocy not to display the main menu when there is no connection to the servers . Option for automatic teaming when performing tasks from the game plot  , and many other  which is present in all such games
---
Hmm that makes them much less appealing outside of INT for xp, since I never put that above 5.
---
Damn im sorry man. Lost sbq flux recently to mirelurk queen and it got snatched up quick. Feelsbad
---
You get the level 1s for free. So you can walk out of 76 with your party hat and have 6 level 1 perks.
---
You drop it instead of equipping it and placing it somewhere. I think it may take off the armor pieces, but you can transfer them back to the armor I believe
---
I'm came because there was a promise of spaghetti.
---
This is just shit about melee weapons. Please get back to the pasta it's been missed in discussion.
---
I have reported this many times, but there is no response from them.
---
Sooo you've became the equivalent of the Animal Planet/Nat Geo Wild cameraman and just sat there and took shots of the wild nature. Next level of roleplay if you ask me. GG
---
I use it for Distant Thunder or Surface to Air since my CAMP is in range. I throw the nade and kind of drag the Scorched into the zone. Its hard keeping them all there but it usually works.
---
Also i take over workshops near places i know spawn events or always have enemies for target practice.
---
Using sneak and lobbing one in a group of Super Mutants near Abandoned Bog town is always fun
---
That’s what happens when one lives in America 🇺🇸
---
I hope so :)
---
Damm that heavy duty perk that was cut could’ve saved power armour
---
Now scroll down to read how people complain on players doing that. Because this breaks the event for the rest of Earl assassination crew.
---
Fun fun fun
---
Thanks for the info. What about the 3rd*, is it bugged as well? I got a lot of limb/reduced weight combinations lately, but cannot tell for sure if there have been others dropped by mobs.
---
Anyway, i'm looking forewards to reading your upcoming ripper article.
---
Like in Pokémon, where you left your pokémon for trade and while you're where offline someone could trade it. A good idea, but I doubt Beth will implement it.
---
I've had similar things happen. One kid had a mic and explained that they'd read how nice the community is, so they asked  ... with all the social grace they learned from GTA.
---
That one actually got some help once they started acting appropriately.
---
I run SBQ and Earle almost every day so thats where I see it as being useful same with Taking one for the Team . Ultimately its down to your build though as its whatever caters to your playstyle.
---
Making a post complaining about this makes YOU the drama queen. Projecting hard.
---
It’s a known bug on every system, they’re just too busy reskinning shit for the sake of “new content” to bother fixing it. That bug, the concrete shoes bug, and the fast travel bug are by far the most annoying things to deal with in every day play.
---
Not only on PC, have happened to me 3 times on xbox doing the encrypted event, in all 3 I had to restart the game because I couldn't respawn.
---
Thank you sir for finally giving me a use for all the frags and whatnot I get from doing random challenges
---
It wouldn't work as a lot of us have been grinding packs for a while and have them saved. ;)
---
Hey the wasteland will wear you out. Theres no time for all that frilly nonsense when you finally crash on a soft squishy mattess. I mean have you noticed how quick you start snoring? Out like a light.
---
You’re the reason I grief events 🤣
---
I still need to do more research about the 90% reduced weight thing. I personally feel i see this one QUITE often compared to other third stars so I feel there is something there but I cant say anything with confidence yet. Hopefully soon I will have more info.
---
That makes sense. I'm just thinking about the coin investment it takes to level these things up. It is really a heavy commitment to go down one path versus the other.
---
&gt; Can we please remove ~~the prompt when dropping~~ floater grenades?
---
FTFY
---
At minimal 50% larger. You get one at your base but three at workshops. Most workshops are middle of BFE. They have a minimal range, so only used for attacking and softening up targets. It does great damage, huge aoe, but that range is rough.
---
I wouldn't mind a nice, compact one.  Perhaps the size of a warehouse or two, already furnished with the main crafting benches.  Give it practically no room to add more buildings, just a bit of space for defences outside.  Something like a small lumbermill.
---
Effect drops are definitely intentional not spaghetti, it’s constantly being manipulated behind the scene, some effects (garbage) have way higher chance than others.
---
Its really not that big of a deal to do multiple characters under the current PTS version - I'm working through my characters and already have 2 to where I can max upgrade their base legendary set... working through number 3 now. If you play consistently and set yourself targets its turned out to be surprisingly reasonable. 
---
Now I just need the next season to give me more incentive to invest time in levelling. ;)
---
I haven't seen any post my bad. I only did it when I solo so I could mess around and see if anything was different
---
The prompt needs to stay, it's the grenades that need to go. Either remove from game or turn them into normal items that can actually be dropped or sold.
---
If we're going to get them as random loot, we should be able to deal with them just like with any other random loot.
---
I've never gotten my hands on that. Where to find them Cursed weapons?
---
It worked on "Heavy" (Combat, Metal, Leather) Armor, not Power Armor.
---
I feel the same way about the scrap.  Get rid of the 'loose, waste, excess, moulded' etc
---
Screws, Acid, Plastic - that's just fine with me!
---
that’s what she said.
---
Potentially they could have been role playing, as a Raider. That doesn't make a difference to whether the demand would work though.
---
Why would I need to spend any time sever hopping? Why would I be out of crafting resources? I like your 2 other ideas but the first one is a literary game and game economy breaker.
---
I use them for events. Realy help in the new colossal problem. Do you need some?
---
Power armor is not heavy armor. Those perks actually made power armor worse by pushing the damage protection of regular armor closer to what power armor offers.
---
I would assume something like this where its not even possible to obtain other effects such  as swing speed or power attack on these weapons, which once was possible, wasnt intentional but just an oversight  or human error. For example with my post last  week , [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/igsdg5/legendary\_drop\_fun\_facts\_with\_keiji\_week1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/igsdg5/legendary_drop_fun_facts_with_keiji_week1/) , making only the metal left leg in the heavy/sturdy variant doesnt make much sense at all if it was intentional... AAAAAALTHOOOOOUGH...
---
If you don't like open world's you'll drop this game within days. Watched my friend play it and all he did was move his base over and over. He quit in 2 days. At endgame you gotta make your own fun.
---
1 perk coin per level is far less good than the actuel system. I'm lvl 530 on main main and with the actuel system I will have more than 900 coins, with your idea less than 500, so it's a no no thank you.
---
PC? I’ll make you some. The plan is a rare drop from Project Paradise.
---
No offense to you but you should include some paragraphs it will make it easier to read.
---
Random prize after A Colossal Problem
---
Fix constant frame drop when opening inventory, the fast travel bug(please), better hit registration, iron all vault heist bugs, fix bugs with colossal problem and make logical rebalances to it. Just in general playtest their own game please I beg
---
Seriously, we should call this the 'Crazy Frog' bug
---
If so I'm all over it.  I hate power armor, and never use it, and I hate taking my armor off to go into radiation areas.
---
Collect legendary stuff from leader of the pack to give out.
---
Yes. The legendary stat perks give you extra points to equip perks with. But stats are capped at 15, regardless of legendary perks. So you can't get 20 points of perks in a stat.
---
They are a possible reward for completing a  colossal problem. 3 kinds. A pick axe, shovel and  harpoon gun
---
Half of my perks are for the improvement of anything related to item durability, food and hunger, AND GODDAMN WEIGHT. 
---
I feel like there is little room for actual combat perks which bugs me.
---
Colossal Problem quest. A shovel, pickaxe, and a harpoon gun. You can't polish a turd.
---
Certainly there are times it’s only oversight. But there has only been oversights that drops all garbage, no oversight that causes higher chance for good effects. If it’s only oversight the good/bad ones would be 50/50.
---
Shittiest answer award...nominee right here. Feelin a bit ripe tonight mate?
---
The floater grenades are for pvp I thought throw the poison one i hear that works the best
---
I usually drop that note in front of a player vendor selling ammo for like 2-5 caps per
---
Don't bother with them. All 3 cursed weapons are scrip material. You can buy them from player vendors for \~500 caps.
---
Thanks for the heads up what is the page?
---
Sent you the name. We are not allowed to link it here. Some bs between the devs
---
Hard facts cant wait for one wasteland.
---
Customer Service
---
Yeah when i use vats on my handmade/fixer, it shows damage numbers but does no damage to the SBQ or Earle.
---
Ya. I can totally see a max level Follow Through being beneficial to save a few shots, as you say. That really helps with crowd control.
---
Ultimately, it comes down to how it affects damage with all the changes they are making. Gun Fu and Adrenaline are already good crowd control perks, so it has to be way better than them. 
---
And how different is Concentrated Fire from this new effect with respect to having a single target? Really, if it does not end up being a multiplicative increase, we aren't going to notice the damage boost.
---
I do wonder if there will be a death mark or something, so your team knows a boss is debuffed.
---
Actually there are some 'oversights' i would consider player positive  but i dont really want to go too much into those at the moment. Maybe some point in the future but I have several ideas for the following weeks lined up before then
---
Thank you my child!
---
Have mine, and my welcomes!
---
So I copied all of the perks and read through them. The only ones I want that survived are below. Guess am lucky my character levels are split 200/190/120/90/60, although it sucks you can't share the upgraded cards also.
---
Ammo Factory
---
Far Flung Firework
---
Funky Duds
---
Master Inf
---
Power Sprinter
---
Just like scrapping stuff in workshops. People would take over a players workshop and scrap all generators and turrets if they would give good materials.
---
All just seems boring and adds nothing to the game for end game players.
---
I want that cursed shovel dammit lol
---
So I need to go back in.
---
Edit : did you try fast travelling to one of your team mates: that worked for me one time
---
Between this and lost duplicate cards, why the tumbling fuck wouldn't they just keep perk coins tied directly to level and just let you deal with your cards how you see fit when perk loadouts come.
---
The pic ax isn't terrible. But yeah they're not super high end pieces. But the pick is good if you run bloodied 2h and don't have anything better haha
---
Yeah the only downside was not being able to fast travel if either bar was almost empty.
---
I always enjoy this &amp; try to reciprocate where possible. Plus the heart emote after. Feels n such.
---
I remember the first time I saw another player do it, in a nuked Whitesprings &amp; it was an immediate "that's genius!" moment. Been following suite ever since.
---
I was mad because I didn't seem to get the new cursed items..... until they started flowing..... anybody need a harpoon shovel?
---
I'd have done Season 2 (although very slowly) but the rewards genuinely look so dire, so not other bothered if I miss it. I would have liked the fourth Stein but I'm not wasting boring grinding time for it.
---
You can build in a teammates camp, you can even build stuff they don't have plans for
---
Just not in public teams, you gotta be in a private group
---
Now, this is a story all about how
---
My life got flipped-turned upside down
---
And I'd like to take a minute
---
Just sit right there....
---
Least they all have rw
---
Those will really only be boss fights and should work the same. The rest of the enemies should scale down and will give the xp at the level its showing you.
---
&gt;Ammo Factory - Produces 50/75/100/150% more rounds when crafting ammunition.
---
 I can use my LMG!
---
Y’all gonna get enough of trying to police what guns people use. Will be the same people complaint others are telling you how to play.
---
Yeah, I think it's actually going to be great.  I was helping a lower level get through a tough (for them) area.  They weren't doing much damage, and I was essentially carrying them.  It's exactly why I was there and I was perfectly fine with it, but to hear that they'll be equally leveled to both of us is going to be good I think.
---
Nope, but you can use depleted cores in making ultracite cores however. That what I use them for.
---
vodka lemonade? how about rum? Iike that better with lemonade!
---
ps. paddle ball should be legendary. I saved mine....
---
&gt; Will that do damage to other enemies?
---
I mean, the explosion and bone fragments might?
---
One of the only good ones I have experienced tbh.
---
They also have a super low chance of dropping from events in the Cranberry Bog. But frankly, the chances are so low that you might as well not even try. For all practical purposes, Fort Defiance is indeed the only way to get them.
---
T-45 Jet Pack Internal Database Bracers and some Hydraulics...
---
are u kidding? what kind of nonsense question is that?
---
Mods, can u delete that post pls? -,-
---
link?
---
Yeah, i have a few items that I do not have plans for since I was lvl 10. Someone else built them in my camp. They still show with the denied/ not available but it says I have 1 and can place them or repair. I never got the plans  for them and changed camps hundreds of times. Past week I was searching for a good camp , I sm rebuilding at least twice a day, still searching.   If scrapped they are gone.
---
I'm happy with mine, lots of trap camps at whitespring station, and they are just in range.
---
Althought yes, it should be larger
---
First off Mr. Squeeze agrees with me on the vodka lemonade and second  off paddle ball is so fun boing boing boing boing
---
I just hit level 60 a while ago so I can probably get two legendary perks once I hit level 75, correct? If so then I plan on choosing Master Infiltrator and Ammo Factory. Having less QoL perks in my actual build will help out alot.
---
Make all weapon types viable. Get rid of Bloodied and Junkie exploits. Fix magic weapons. Reduce bullet sponge enemies accordingly. Fix the goddamm servers so I don't get kicked so often.
---
All legendary perks are open from the get go? can i switch them around?
---
fair. I'll drink my rum alone then.
---
VATS
---
Yes. After reaching 25/50/75/100% ore deposited, a wave of additional mobs will spawn - snallygasters, cave crickets, deathclaws and a few other types are possible.
---
Yes
---
You can roll it in glitter though
---
Does Sizzling Style reduce damage taken from explosions like Fireproof does or is it purely just the fire damage from stuff like floaters?
---
Text chat
---
Seems like everybody has this reaction after completing the run.
---
Or just buff grenades so we want to use them instead of throwing them away...
---
I’m just glad I don’t have to spend perk coins on Master Infiltrator.
---
Nah nades suck and just weight you down
---
Forgot that was going on....still giving same scrappy rewards?
---
You read my mind lol
---
Except for the name. I was thinking queen of the night (? may want to get a vampire weapon also )
---
I feel you. I came back and rebuilt a camp. Really can't seem to make myself do any quests. The thrill is gone. The icing on the cake is when I accidentally complete a Daily Quest and end up with doodley squat.
---
&gt; This works if your team is public or private
---
I call BS on the public part. Private team, yes. But not pulic, because the build menue is not accessible.
---
Can those new chems be dropped, transferred to another player or sold?
---
Can you change the cards for free or is there a cost?
---
I agree they suck. But if they were stronger I would carry some with me.
---
This pains me, because I look around player vendors to try to buy the pickaxe, but nobody seems to sell it.
---
Best one I've experienced was Serendipity never not working. Game crashed and the magic zero damage taken was gone...
---
So I could throw them away more
---
So the paddle ball counts as a one handed melee?
---
That would make a nice skin for a shovel.
---
I just follow low people around and I'm doing whatever they are. Chilling in the camp. Killing mobs. Questing. Swimming accross a lake when I dont have aqua boy. I'm in. I leave stagnant loot for them and never kill a mob before they chunked into it. Sometime i make full sets of leather deep pocketed (except the chest which I dont have halp?). This is the end game.
---
You can use empty cores to make ultracite ones
---
If you're moaning after ye
---
1l
---
L
---
Toxic players must just be ignored. Never allow them provocations. 
---
This is people who we probably should feel sorry for.
---
Oh well, my energy rifleman build doesn't need any of that. Looting cake day bruh!
---
Even with my 75 lvl i'm still not ready to go there. Although it's mostly because of some careless players dropping da bomb directly on the mine entrance!
---
The paddle ball has the keyword 'WeaponTypeMelee1H' but it also seems to reference a lot of pistol things.  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/pC2hLV9](https://imgur.com/a/pC2hLV9)
---
Seconded. Nukashine t65 please.
---
&gt;As OP said, using legacies in ACP is beneficial, and given Earl is a fucking bullet sponge, everyone can tag him.
---
some dude melted earl down in a couple of seconds yesterday - it wasnt really benefical for me or the other 6 players - why must everything done so quick?
---
If you’re online at reset, some challenges will auto-complete without giving the rewards.  Lost 7 of them today and 2k in points because of it but *definitely* be sure to be offline for weekly reset because it’ll do the same with weeklies.
---
Perhaps the harpoon gun can be of use. I've used Vampire HG with Fletchettes mod and it was kinda... tanky? Not sure about that, but that healing was better than nothing.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
It's just a power nap so it's ok.
---
Known bug and it sucks.
---
However the one time it happened to me I stayed on the respwawn screen hoping the mine collapse would fix it. when the mine collapsed inwas teleported outside but still on that screen then closed my app when I loaded back in I had rewards.
---
Not exciting but if your team wins and you wait it out atleast you won't miss on some rewards.
---
That was likely a magic weapon, rather than a legacy. Magic weapons are supposed to be fixed in the next patch.
---
Yeah i hear ya. Dont warry too much though. Just have a suit of PA ready or other hazmat and with good fighters its not that bad. Me and  my community took him out in under 5 min last night.
---
 It can be tough but you got this!.
---
 What platform you on btw? I have an extra shovel.
---
Tbh I roll a pretty optimized rifleman/commando build. First thing I'm going to do is get that strength perk so I can finally have more QoL perks.
---
Gamertag? I would like to share my experiences with tesla guns ;-)
---
I was wondering why there are no gates.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/post/2940893
---
I can't give this one enough upvotes!!! Love the plushies!!!!
---
I've been running around in t51b and haven't had any issues. Hydraulics, jetpack etc and now spending bullion on the t65
---
Working fine for me on Xbox. I do it every day. As previously stated, sometimes he takes a while to give you the quest but it does work.
---
Why was nuclear proliferator cut? Or more like when? Thought it said on the pts it would return later?
---
What is it that you most desire?
---
So you're a writer on the side right?! 
---
Awesome job making us feel like we were there to witness the entire thing!! Thanks for sharing!!!!
---
For perk cards they are capped at 15. You would still get extra strength.
---
Blaze it
---
This reads like a bad fanfic and I loved every second of it
---
1. Whats the benefit of exploding enemies, aesthetics aside? 
---
2. Is it possible to change Legendary Perk Cards after choosing 6?
---
Only Fire Damage. So Floater and Angler damage mostly, I believe.
---
I know right ☺️. Most all major baddies need a plushie. The Colossal Wendigo plushie needs to be redone though. The plushie itself is good, but it would look better bigger. Would stand out more too, especially In a collection.
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks, targeting hud, optimal servos and red chinese atom shop paint for the jet pack
---
I tried it, reload is too slow.
---
Happened to me when having SLI or just second video card active.
---
Freezer is the best, followed by gnasher. Cryo anything is great, really.
---
I have only one word for you: Nice
---
Heavy gun user, once you have ss armor it's so cheap to repair , heavy guns last for days without repairs.  No need to run any perks (except swap in when you repair to 200% or white knight for cheaper) if you have legacy explosive energy weapons I could see running the gun one.
---
Wish they'd buff grenades as a whole so you wouldn't feel the need to drop them.
---
This!! I've said the same thing from the first moment I saw it!!! Didn't know what it was at first since its so tiny and just didn't seem to be that... literally every other plushie you know immediately what it is!!
---
Usually charging weapons seem to be the prob in vats. Instant shoot like shotguns, rifles etc seem to do MORE damage in vats.
---
1. Splash damage to nearby enemies, mostly.
---
2. You can but it costs 1 Perk Coin currently. It is unclear if this number will be maintained in the live version.
---
Getting trapped in power armor.
---
In the lore the only way to actually kill a wendigo is with fire to cleanses it corrupted spirit if not then it will just regen
---
Anything with emergency protocols and calibrated shocks works for me.
---
yes, i think it was a magic one
---
Benefical means something different for everyone. I'm looking forward to an enduring fight at SBQ or ACP, many waves of opponents and a cool team that delivers a tough fight.
---
What I often get are no rewards because someone thinks it's enough to collect the XP for the boss and replicate this as soon as possible.
---
What I get are Fallout 1st tents that disrupt spawn points or enemy behavior.
---
I fully understand that these claims do not apply to everyone
---
Yesterday I had to smile when someone melted himself with the first shot at the SBQ Fight
---
I think one
---
Same here, but I really don't need anything else from STR except bandolier 2\*, which I have
---
no worries...
---
You want to grief others events, my tesla gonna grief your events ;-)
---
TIL there is artillery.  How do you obtain it?
---
I've seen them in some CAMPs but thought they were decorative.  Never seen one in use.
---
Check your daily quest log in pip boy.  You may already have it but not ‘selected’
---
Ok this is interesting, melee is gonna be even better now.
---
Nothing, this would just double the number of bugs (p)
---
I'm good for taking one extra hazmat from Radiation Rumble, but... all i have is weak Gauss and AA plasma. I may be a nuisance or just a liability on this cerberus sibling extermination.
---
My platform is potato PC. Good for taking one of those extra fry you wanted :D
---
is it the wood event reward? I didnt donate anything, do I still get reward?
---
Please.
---
Are you on the PS4.? (my psn is tracyg1976)
---
Saw a note/holitape called "Bad news" priced at 2020.
---
Its always slow on HG, but the Cursed effect is helping with that!
---
Better do i shot and let him finish them off
---
So you’re gonna grief events I’m already griefing to grief me? Makes sense.
---
Yeah, balistic ammo is kinda wierd, the distance of your target does a lot ... :/
---
Lmao she would probably get mad at us knowing that in our camps we have parts of his dad that are still moving and twitching
---
I have the Vampire Gat laser as well. Love that weapon lol. Got me out of several tight spots. Plus if there is a bunch of high level players in ACP or SBQ I draw off all the mobs so they can focus on main event. Just got to remember to hold down a power plant a couple times a week for Fusion Cores and i'm set. (Currently level 74 in game)
---
That’s me running at 19% health.  I usually die when running away with ‘the fear’ straight across a lava pool and can’t stim.  The joy.  I do die but I’m also the nukagirl dishing out the mele damage to his knee caps!
---
Awesome information, thanks for posting it! You mention that If you pick one up, another won’t spawn until you’ve picked up a certain amount of world items. Do you know roughly how many items that would be please?
---
Personally I puff while my dweller take a nap for that sweet xp buff
---
It generally makes little sense to grief events.
---
So I just continue the pointless
---
Im ps4 im sorry friend. But even a little helps. Dying is part of the game, no shame in it. Theres plenty of small wendigos to take on too n it helps the heavy hitters when someone focuses on the adds
---
Super helpful and clear. Thank you!
---
Can you turn off a legendary perk without having to spend a perk coin to swap it? e.g., what rads? Is bad for my bloodied build normally but I might want it in a nuke zone, or if I want to run full health for a change of pace without respeccing.
---
I’m looking first at these:
---
Master infiltrator
---
Funky duds
---
Ammo factory
---
Survival shortcut
---
What rads?
---
Or maybe SPECIAL boosts:
---
Legendary PER END CHA AGI
---
Fire, loved the Griffiths benches
---
Perhaps i'll visit that, when i'm finished with my armor.
---
Use a gaussrifle + the perk that give u some more range by aiming with scopes and your problem is solved... ok and YES the drop off is a little bit high because most weapons cant get more range then over 220 and even that number looks like u have to stay much closer then u want as a stealth sniper buts its the game engine.
---
The pickaxe is alright if youre a two handed melee build, the harpoon gun with flechette mod turns into a magic shotgun in VATS but the reload time makes it so unfun to use
---
Posion resist is very handy btw
---
It makes little sense to grief at all, but it’s entertaining.
---
Wait so my lvl 380 friend will see a lvl 80 enemy while I see a lvl 10 or something?
---
Ahh, appreciate this. I'm good then, never on during reset. Enjoy your day or night mate. 👍
---
I wish that funky duds and similar gave you the resistances whilst wearing full armour types, even if they don't match. So I can wear 3 pieces of heavy robot armour and 2 of heavy combat for it to work etc.
---
i spawned in. said camp cannot be placed. lets c whats here.
---
someone had copied my camp. down to the lights. Only changed wording on neon display.
---
i was annoyed. soon as i emoted ?? he/she disconnected.
---
What is the cloth donation reward and where are we up to with it?
---
Edit* it's the collectron. I NEED IT
---
Yeah cause that's what you want in your house lol
---
If you have the herbivore mutation, then definitely the communist scavenger bot. all those great soups!
---
Yeah idk I wish there were but I like them otherwise and have found some ways unlike using them.
---
Its nothing to do with the BoS rewards. Its a CAMP item plan you can possibly receive upon completion of the event "A colossal Problem".
---
If you run sbq you get improved repair kits. No need to even bother with repair perk cards
---
I dont think you know what exploit means
---
its so annoying to find ballistic fiber currently without going to a website to find the spawn points then traversing around the world collecting it. Steel scrap drops on everything ugh
---
I do! I’m on xbox
---
Bummer I’m on box
---
T51 would be the best all rounder until you get T65.
---
Targeting hud, calibrated shocks
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
That is the best time to do it. Unlike me 10 minutes ago. I was afk at my camp while I rolled the doob and some moron goes and starts ACP, so here's me puffing away while tanking all the damn Wendigos trying not to die even though the health bar is so damn blurry and ash is dropping onto my crotch region...
---
I don’t like PvP, but I love Monster Mash for the XP. Which means I usually run like hell if anyone else shows up. (Monster Mash is considered PvP even if there’s no one else there for the purposes of “level up during PvP” challenges, too)
---
Nobody wants to sell it? And here I am getting it every other time. If you want one, I can just give it.
---
i personally want them to reduce the amount of workshops by about 5 or 6 BUT add all the resources lost from said resources added to all the other workshops increasing their worth.
---
i want to see workshops being worth fighting over, currently thats not the case :(
---
:( PS4
---
The fast travel bug more than anything. I experience it so much that all the other bugs seem either rare and/or trivial compared to it.
---
You bastard, you beat me to it. 😂🤣👍
---
The game probably need something to show you actually want help.
---
Personnally, in this kind of game I like doing the progress all by myself (finding my PA? armor etc...) , and I hate when somebody comes to help me while I don't want help.
---
Last time I restarted a char, someone jumped on me at the vault exit, and drop me stimpak and lvl1 armor. While I can appreciate the gesture idea, this was seriouly anticlimactic, I didnt took the gift, and the dude made me sure I understood he wasnt happy.
---
And by "helps", redhoodswolf means "completely saves their a$$" except for the most powerful of players.  On one of my most successful runs, I was able to really damage Earl with a Vampire Minigun (accelerated barrel/fire rate 209) but only because someone was killing wendigo's.  I only had to kill a couple of them.   Little did I know someone was killing absolute mobs of them.   When I didn't have anyone doing that on another run, I had to deal with like 20+ of them.  I lost count.  It was a lot.
---
Just plan on dying once or twice in this.   Just get back in the fight asap.  In other words, I don't ask for stim help.  If I have to, I just die and get right back in it.  I want everyone to keep laying on the damage rather than running over to help me.
---
Pretty much that, yes.
---
its doing more damage out of VATS because of the bugged +33% VATS hit chance since rapid fire weapons with traits like that one are bugged and doing "magic" damage
---
Lol. Whatever. If people can’t answer a question it’s simple because they don’t like the TRUE answer.
---
Or at least let me turn them in for gold or scrip or caps or something. I currently just throw them at whatever the second I get them.
---
who is it entertaining for? Hardly for the injured player.
---
I also want to have a little bit of fun - you grief their events and I'll make a slide show out of them for you so you can watch them frame by frame - deal?
---
Where is that damage coming from?    Still trying to wrap my head around this event....   I've had three runs so far.
---
I just need the Damn Backpack from this event. I've earned or traded for all the other rewards, but no one ever knows what they're doing in random servers, least of all when changing the experiment, which is what's needed for the Backpack.
---
They should have added a legendary perk which stopped you needing food and drink.
---
Then if it was such a problem for some players they could remove the need.
---
I not got the drop three time must be bugged if it's guaranteed r it didn't pop up.
---
I am lvl 20 myself, and I would like some help sometimes, it was espesially frustrating playing alone yesterday since I kept dying to either bloodeagles or other stuff in thatt area. but at the same time, I'm used to playing alone so it gets wierd for me when there are other payers there.
---
They need to fix laser tripwires, keypad switches too
---
It actually is kinda big deal for a sheer majority of players (I'd say about 98% of the playerbase), most of which play quite casually and will never get higher than level 100-200 (well, maybe some of them eventually will if Beth will decide to continue server maintenance for years to come).  I believe they won't consider such grind reasonable at all.
---
From what you're saying I make a conclusion that you already have two characters at aboul lvl 600 with 3rd one on the way.
---
I played this game for 1900h+ since beta and my main is lvl 640. (And yeah, I grinded season 1 for 4-6h a day to be able to finish it in 3 weeks and finally make a break from the game. Levelled up about 200 times in the process) I also got 4 alts of levels 70-140, which are really a drop in the ocean if you compare xp requiremets to get to lvl 140 and to lvl 640. What I'm trying to say from a perspective of player who already played quite a lot: I don't consider grinding several chars to the same rep/xp levels reasonable in any way.
---
Fast travel, VATS, lag that's so severe it makes the game unplayable at points, fix "explore different areas" bug where areas you've obviously visited still aren't marked off in Challenges.    
---
Did papashekels (or a name similar to that) make up a huge, wonderful list of these things?
---
Gauss weapons and Vats.
---
Am I the only one bothered that this was a hyped event and then when you finish it..... nothing happens? Like not even a cool story about why you needed to beat him in the race or even a cool congratulations image. Nothing. Just over.
---
The spit attacks mostly. But i think melee aswell
---
Noo I wanted nuclear proliferator
---
No joke.
---
Gotta be quick on the draw. When it comes to overly used one liners 😂
---
Reward
---
Tell me about it. Maybe next time.. 😂
---
The recent mass duping also pretty much killed trading and economy in this game. Anyone who says otherwise is delusional (and propably holding couple dozen duped legacy weapons on their mule).
---
At the time of the dupe wave i knew this would happen. It was hilarious seeing dupers justify their duping and posting comments like "We are doing everyone a favor by making these weapons available to everyone!".
---
Just go and try to trade anything on the popular trading sub or discord now. Unless you have boat load of legacy items it is impossible to get even the basic top tier items anymore.
---
All the legacy items need to go. Period. EDIT: Or as pointed out by OP, possibly made equal in power when compared to the ballistic non-legacy explosive weapons = dropped down to the same 20% added damage.
---
And i'm not saying this because i don't have them myself. I had one, tried it and got very quickly rid of it. It has been my personal choice to stay away from them, because i have always thought that they should not exist.
---
And before someone comes in crying that "My BE15 Gatling Plasma was a legit drop for me!"
---
No it fucking wasn't.
---
Before the patch where they made it impossible for the energy weapon drop with explosive there weren't many of them around because people didn't use them and just threw them away for being really really bad. Energy weapons at the time broke so fast (especially with explosive effect on them) that they were not used by anyone. You have to remember that the repair kits did not exist yet.
---
Only energy weapons with explosive effect that were around after bethesdas decision to remove explosive from energy weapon rolls were lower level ones with really bad prefixes and minor effects. Not a single godroll legacy was around. Those came later with the 3rd party software/hacks that could spawn any item in game.
---
EDIT: All this said, bugged legendary effects aka "magic" weapons are equally a major issue that needs to be addressed by bethesda.
---
But spawn points in camps are random. They’re always around the same spot, but never exactly one particular spot. At my old camp, players would usually spawn next to my generator shed, which I have locked just because there’s literally nothing in there save for a generator, and I hate seeing doors left open. And yet sometimes, people spawn in that shed. Not their fault, and it wasn’t mine either. 
---
Most people, myself included, that want the spawn mat back just want to have more control. Have them spawn directly in front of their vendors, or at the front door, or something.
---
The level requirement for this shit is absolutely ludicrous.
---
Do you know of the auto unlock counts toward challenges?
---
I originally did this, then decided was better to leave it at the overseers Camp. Gives opportunity to experience the game a bit first, then find helpful goodies. Plus, choose what to take, if anything.
---
My best (worst?) example of this:   in another player's camp.   "Give me all your X.   Give me all your X or I'll nuke your camp."  So I'm witnessing a shakedown or attempted robbery?
---
Honestly, my response would be one of three things:   server hop just to get away from the annoying little s\*\*\*, LOL, tell them to go f\* themselves, or just kill them.   Depending on how I feel at the moment.    Can't believe some of these players.
---
I want to nuke a spaceship. Want end game Flatwoods monster.
---
Yeah, I think someone above lvl 200 tried to give me something last night, because there was suddenly a bag on the deck of my Camp. I kind of tried to talk true the headset, but no responce so I guess he diden't hear it. So I got kinda aqward and logged off since I had a seminar the next day. But at the same time I have to join that one via zoom because the start of a sinus infection.
---
nice
---
Troubleshooter's with deep pocketed, str/agi bonuses and weight reduction. It's a must for silo/encryptid/awol, especially with One-Wasteland. I can tank anything else with just an Excavator PA and Medic torso.
---
Picked up the plan recently and I was surprised at how cheap they are to make. And then I was surprised that more people dont sell them in vendors. 
---
 I've been giving them away for free to help also and most of the people getting them are over 100 😄
---
Wait til you see the file folders for this game. Everything is a MISC folder. It's a nightmare to datamine
---
Dude I can also kill a hole mob of Max lvl supermutants with a single shot of my Auto grenade Launcher.....  the legacys are strong yea but, you have to pay the price of repairing them every couple mags and especially the laser every mag.
---
Kinda disappointed about those Armor perks that were cut, though it makes sense, sort of. Doesn't matter though, definitely see some perks I'll be grabbing.
---
Server hop?
---
Electric Absorption has a strong enough healing effect that if there are enemies using energy weapons, such as flamers, they can make you practically immortal.
---
Hopefully "What Rads?" doesn't have a change of removing a mutation.  Would hate to accidentally remove starched genes only to have a few mutations get cured.
---
You got a hacked gun my dude. Very valuable
---
Rather sad they took out heavy duty, but hey, any buff to power armor isn't allowed and we have known this for long enough.
---
Legendary strength, ammo factory and master infiltrator will be added to my line-up I think. Not sure about the others yet, agility possibly and int or luck maybe? Funky dud's is interesting but how often do we deal with poison anyway?
---
Yeah I was trying to get a junkies missile launcher with RW just yesterday and the guy asked me if I had any legacies!
---
But I don't collect legacies as Ive been waiting on them to get a massive damage nerf, I thought this incoming balance was going to address legacies but apparently they're still doing the full damage on PTS? I'm on Xbox so I can't play it.
---
But yeah there about 95% duped now, the good ones at least. On Xbox we don't have any way to spawn in weapons so the dozen or so God rolls we had before the patch have all been duped. 
---
Just before the duping wave, everyone was wanting a JE gatling plasma, there were only 2 that were known to exist on Xbox. They're very common now to see offered in trade posts.
---
So what you’re saying is that the real end game is the friends we make along the way.
---
Oooo nice! That means i can make over 150 5.56 rounds with Ammo Factory &gt; Ammosmith &gt; Super Duper. That'll save me sooo much resources! Glad to hear that it stacks up.
---
I'm currently unemployed so I kind of like the daily challenges. it gives me something to do other than constantly check my e-mail. 
---
I'm two spaces away from finishing, I'm kind of excited to get the final prize.
---
They should really give detailed descriptions about some of the cards, like the exploding enemies ones or the blocking one for example, I would assume that people will be really mad if they waste roughly 88 character levels of Perk Coins to max out a card only to realize that the ''explosion'' is just a crappy frag grenade copy.
---
Afaik there is no system to scrap the actual ''Legendary Cards'' to get perk coins back, that will bite them in the ass if they ever decide to nerf or completely rework one in the future.
---
I can already see some people complaining about  Follow Through because it will be rendered useless in the first set of Daily Ops.(we all know how popular stealth builds are)
---
Thank you for the reply and information
---
PA is really only good for dropping down and blocking doors so mobs can't bother you during nuke silos.
---
You are a god. :)
---
my favorite is when I look in a vendor machine and they have disease cures. I buy EVERY SINGLE ONE.
---
Only running two myself, one is locked so I have access to one myself at all times, the other is not.
---
Here is your karma my dude
---
The point is, they reduced the explosive damage effect on all weapons but forgot to do so on energy weapons.
---
It's been broken ever since. All they need to do is balance their damage so that for example, 
---
an explosive gatling laser does the same damage as an explosive minigun.
---
Validate install
---
Take off some of its health before you emote.  
---
I've ran into this same problem several times, but it's not 100 percent.   Just earlier this week, there was a great UF where I was able to lure them out and I think everyone got a hit (except one player who just didn't seem interested for whatever reason).
---
The handmade is part of the basic loot table so you don't need to know the plan to get it as a legendary drop. That only applies to weapons that were added in post-launch like the fixer, sheepsquatch staff, bear arm etc.
---
As for how to get more legendaries...well you would just have to hunt down legendary enemies. Nuking the Whitespring is still a really good legendary farm, but you're not guaranteed to get 3* items off 3* enemies so it's just luck.
---
A Colossal problem rewards a guaranteed 3* legendary, but that takes a bit of time and resources to farm so it's probably no more effective than your other options.
---
Removing content and weapons is stupid. They should focus that manpower on something more useful
---
this too
---
What about adults with lives and jobs? Not going to be possible dude. Sounds like you are able to play 12 hours a day.
---
If it cannot be used while in Power Armor, it is unarmed.
---
Wow.
---
Thanks for this! There's a few I'm definitely interested in there, will probably get What Rads first, as much for the regeneration as the resistance. Will hold off on Master Infiltrator until we know more about perk loadouts, as you say. I'll make a decision on Follow Through once I see how much damage I'm doing with the next patch. And Funky Duds looks useful as you don't need much poison resistance to make a big difference. Which leads me to...
---
One (possible dumb) question. What is a "matching" set of armour in this game? For example, would it be "all sturdy armour", "all combat armour", or "all sturdy combat armour"?
---
Are they watching us...
---
Duped and hacked legacy weapons are not content, or items that rightfully exist in the first place. They were created by players. So it is not stupid. Far from it.
---
Thank you! Yea ive tried hoping into colossal problem with some high levels and needless to say all I really did was get in the way so will wait awhile before trying that again. I'll continue what I'm doing and I guess google some get legendary spots and hope for the best. Thanks again :)
---
For a 3\* ranged, no. For a guaranteed 3\* reward, try the A Colossal Problem event.
---
Nothing you can do to affect the drop chances. Also FE might not be the best combination against groups of mobs because the explosive effect will reset the furious effect all the time, giving you no bonus.
---
lol...i know you're not talking about me! ok fine you're talking about me... :) And just for the record I'm pretty sure I killed at least one robot by myself and NO that victory is not taken away because I was downed by a grumpy Gutsy after the quest ended. TYVM!
---
Do you know how mich time we have left?
---
Oh damn, never thought of that. Thanks for the advice.
---
User interface is so fucking bad.
---
- perk card menu unorganized. Rename perks so they're grouped together properly
---
- build menu is a nightmare
---
- crafting menus have so many redundant or unnecessary submenus. *Presents and Pails are two separate submenus, really?*
---
- inventory is likewise unorganized and cluttered. Add new tabs for keys and move that, misc, holotapes and notes to the end. Add IconSortingTags mod. Add BetterInventory mod. I'm sorry you poor console peasants have to deal with that abomination. The inventory is set up assuming there's like 50 items in the game total but it's closer to 10000
---
*Deaf and mute people have entered the chat*
---
Thanks.
---
If you want a very specific weapon you're best off trying to trade for one. 
---
On the plus side FE isn't a great combo on a hamdmade and a 2\* will probably cost no more than 6k. Depending on a 3rd star maybe double.
---
Personally I wish I had a magic heavy weapon, but then again I'd just use my regular for  a few minutes till damage is soaked and then burn it down.
---
Thank you :)
---
I’m fine with them being removed, but fine with them staying. 
---
On one hand, I’ve seen a lot of people camp items would be useless; such as fridges, water purifiers, etc. maybe for them, but not for me. I use inert flux for my water anyway, since it’s so easy to get, provides the same amount of water as purified, and weighs way less. For food, I just kill something when I get hungry. Easy. Even then, I still have the “survival” camp items in my camp because I want it to look realistic. I know the rain catcher that was just in the atomic shop just gave dirty water, and that the water well from the settlers had a lot of complaints about it. I haven’t collected anything from mine, they’re just there because I think they make my camp look better. Same for the fridge. It’s there because my kitchen looks better with it. 
---
On the other hand, if the bars do stay, I’ll also be fine. I’ve already said it’s more than easy enough to get food and water for me. I just wish the bars went down a lot slower. I should at least be able to AFK at my camp to microwave some frozen burritos to eat IRL without coming back and both of the bars are in the red.
---
I also love to sleep with my backpack, including the shovel sticking out of it.
---
Np friend! Oh crouching idk but serms to help too. I run 75  poison resist
---
I think you can still increase your str, you just won’t receive any more str perk points beyond 15
---
I would be ok with them staying in the game, but the explosive splash damage does need to be addressed.
---
Yes upvote for this, congratulation\~\~\~ Nice :D
---
It is hard to get morning wood over the promise of a new outfit. I feel fatigued by it all.
---
(Yes, I just invested in the Woodchucker perk, without knowing that we had just gone to cloth)
---
Yea I know. But it's the same with the TSE Weapons. They had a balanced dmg in the past. Just because they got duped like shit and the explosive perifix was broken so people could kill other by just the splash dmg from the weapons. TS got nerfed into the ground and is imo now completely bullshit and useless. Then because they don't can fix there shitty game, they nerfed every single Explosiv Shotgun, which are now literally also just shit.
---
What they have to  fix is the broken magic 15% armor effect and also in general all the magic rapid fire weapons or shotguns. This is what sucks a lot when you come to a queen or earle fight and he is down in 12 seconds and you can't even tag him a single time.
---
They're still in-game content , it doesn't matter if they're duped or not 🤣🤣
---
Place a second chassis down you ghostwalker
---
Exactly. Rank one works as 3 lockpicking and 3 hacking regular perks.
---
Never trust anything that bleeds but doesn't die from it...a bit like women.
---
Well, with wastelander for all it will be difficult to level up like that i guess...
---
people overhype legacies. I have played and made builds around most of them, laser rifles, gatling lasers, gatling plasmas, flamers. well, most of the good ones at least.
---
the truth about legacies is that they're high maintenance (literally), prone to blow up in your face and their damage isn't as absurd as some people would lead you to believe. similarly to 'unyielding + serendipity makes you invincible', it's just a wives' tale.
---
all of my legacies are sitting on my mules because I can output about the same damage with other weapons. and they're useless for bosses because the splash barely scratches them and they'll break multiple times during the fight.
---
the only exceptions, kinda, are the flamer and the gatling plasma. the flamer isn't particularly good, it's just an interesting build considering it's a silent weapon. but it's awful for bosses anyway, commandos fare better all in all. and the gatling plasma, I was just playing with a JE one and I could swear they nerfed the splash damage.
---
used to be I could just spray in whatever direction and kill anything, now I takes a few well-aimed volleys at even a level 45 scorched.
---
magic weapons are infinitely stronger. and it's probably because I play on PC, but I've never experienced lag caused by legacies.
---
They did not drop legit in the game. They were created using 3rd party software and hacks, then mass duped. So no, they are not content.
---
Absolutely!
---
Put on Fireproof 1 and see the magic
---
Just because people haven't gotten legacies doesn't mean they need to get rid of them. They were (somewhat) farmable in the beginning, and it doesn't matter when new players come in. If they got rid of those, they'd loose a ton of their players and after 76 was released on gamepass, this game has few users and it's dwindling from lack of content, bugs, and no fun endgame. They can't afford to loose any more players or this game will die.
---
Agreed, magic weapons need a fix also.
---
The thing with all these legendary effects though is that they were brought from fallout 4. In that game you could only have 1 effect on each weapon, so explosive damage being so high wasn't a problem.
---
But when you ad explosive on top of 2 shot, then you suddenly have a weapon that is dealing way more damage than was ever Intended. Plus you have more than just 1 player, so the damage being dealt to mobs and bosses is even higher.
---
It's legacies and magic weapons, that have removed the challenge from killing bosses and prompted Bethesda to nerf all.damge in the next update. They should have fixed the exploits, priority #1.
---
not all of them. don't know about consoles, but BE15r and BE90 gatling plasmas existed since before it was possible to inject specific rolls into the game.
---
it's also impossible to differentiate between a dupe and a legit roll, although yes, 99% of them *are* dupes.
---
You can change the settings and make it impossible for your friends to join your private server.
---
You probably told someone's 8yo to get bent. Nice
---
Yeah the gauss does the same. Even fully charged take 3 head shots at 100 yards to take out a West yak super mutant. 2 with bloody mess perk equipped. Close range torso on gauss is instant kill up close.
---
You get a new card pack every 5 levels. Each pack has 4 cards. Each card gives you 2 coins. 2x4=8. So currently, after 5 levels, you can get 8 coins. 10 levels and you get two card packs. 8 cards. 16 coins for 10 levels. With what you’re suggesting, we’d only get 10 coins. Let’s do more math. 50 levels. 10 card packs. 40 cards. 80 potential coins. Versus what you want, which would only give 50 coins for the same amount of levels. 
---
So no. The current way it’s handled, even if it’s still bad, is better than your way.
---
Tactical ops underarmor. Was an atomic shop item.
---
You know you can set it to team invite only, right? Or did you just decide to time travel from October last year to complain when this was already fixed?
---
I don't want them gone, just the explosive damage they deal out to be lowered like it should have been with the rest of the explosive weapons.
---
They won't loose players, they will maybe loose dupers and eBay sellers, but not real players.
---
I have my next project in mind. 
---
Lost Home (south of watoga) is a random encounter location. One of them is 2 settlers arguing about whether to go to crater or foundation. I always tell them to go to foundation. They do leave the place and start walking North but i am wondering if they actually go to crater. Like if i follow them will they get there? Or will they get killed by something. or do they simply vanish at some point.
---
I’m honestly too afraid to screw up the event for everyone else, so that’s why I steer clear of it. Thank you for the tips tho! Now I know what to do
---
Plasma. Fuel weight and how fast you chew through it. Weapon durability.
---
I have this problem too, you're not alone. A friend I've always played with has disappeared from my friend list. Luckily he can still see me on his. But this means I can never join him on his private.
---
Not probably. Pretty sure those are [Cadaveric spasms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaveric_spasm)
---
Oh dude, I already imagine a group of friends nonchalantly driving in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains through interstate 59 .. not a care in the world. All you can hear in the distance is a soft and dewy flapping of lips: \*tpbrrrrrrr\*
---
I’ll tell you how I shot at my rug thinking it was a bear

---
They can't, the gun was put in the game to fire bullets that's why they are such monsters. My plasma does 150 damage per shot, but what they really means is 150 damage per bullet, and how many bullets does that thing shoot when pulling the trigger per second? 10? 50? I do over 1200 damage per 0.6 of a second to give you an idea. They can't nerf them with removing the bullets and they cant do that on those guns without deleting them completely.
---
This is only supposed to work in vats to my knowledge?
---
depends, are you sneaking or not?
---
Because these artillery are mortars and that's not how mortars work. They aren't used as "long range" weapons, the effective range of mortars this size would be around 7000 meters give or take. They aren't used for their range but for their high parabolic trajectories allowing them to hit anything within that range even behind cover.
---
Definitely plasma,  weight is the biggest issue.
---
As others have stated, I'd like for hunger and thirsty to stay in game but maybe not drain so quickly
---
On another note I wouldn't mind a sleep bar like in FO4
---
I must be getting too old for this 😒😒.. I didn't understand a word of what you said.
---
Is it a spaghetti recipe or something??
---
In Fallout 76?
---
😖😖
---
So are you saying the developers don't have the tools to even fix this if they wanted to?
---
So I can't buy it, right? Anyway, thank you :D
---
Or want visitors to spawn right inside their trap
---
Wow.   From armor effects?
---
I’ll try to hit you up in like 7 or 8 hours 😅
---
if you want more than 4 players what do you do?
---
Sun kissed and rad sponge don't affect mutations (both remove rads), so I wouldn't expect this to either.
---
I suppose i could give it a whirl. Thanks for the tips!
---
You'll need to more than two people unless you get ridiculously lucky and two of the creatures happen to wander over to each other or you're fast enough to cover two sectors at once. All three friendlies need to survive to get the top tier rewards where the diffuser and bear arm plans are, if you can't protect them all and a single friendly dies then you're sol.
---
Also clearing the robots on each sector is absolutely needed but can ultimately be a moot point as due to how interior cells work even if you kill every single one after a set period anyone entering the dungeon will be trigger them all to respawn and likely take out one of the friendly creatures.
---
At an absolute minimum you need three people and for each person to be capable of farming and defending a sector on their own. The reason many people give up on this event is because most idiots that show up dog pile on a single sector an leave everything else to die.
---
I used to give new players all the PA frames I found in the wild. Felt like a wast to just leave them there. Recently I've been at max, caps, scrip, stash so I just dump all my loot for them to sell/scrip/scrap.
---
Hm didn't see this suit before. Where can I buy it?
---
yeah players are trying stunts now :)
---
I was in an instance with a lvl 70 and 90 last night.
---
one had a deathclaw gauntlet, and the other an explosive combat rifle. I went through 6000 5mm ammo in my junkies minigun.
---
Failed the event with a sliver of health left on Earle.
---
Was epic though.
---
They are trash.i got cursed weps and threw them away.absolute garbage.as usual.
---
These are NOT legendary. Bethesda, what a shitty, ahitty thing you're doing to the game. Try making it fun.
---
the problem is that we're getting a buggy mess regardless.
---
They can't fix them with how they are made. They can't make all Gatling Plasmas fire plasma when they are firing bullets. They can remove them, but they can't "alter"  them. 
---
I'm sure they could if it was a life and death situation but those guns are rare, and there's other bugs and problems that need to be fixed to help the majority of the fan base. So no, these aren't going anywhere, and if they do, watch all hell break loose for the thousands of players who have given up their entire inventory  to have one.
---
Yep, sadly you can't buy it anymore. You'll have to wait and hope they add it back.
---
no.
---
minigun and .50cal ammo needs MORE GUNPOWDER dammit!!!
---
We're getting delayed buggy mess so we are getting bit of both
---
My plan is to get the legendary specials and then progressively shift points out of the stats they're in to get me more in other areas. I have a 14 strength almost entirely for weight management so +5 means that I can move 5 points out of strength into something that I actually care about and not lose my perk access.
---
Now I just need to push myself the last bit to level 300 for all the slots and then spend an hour cashing in the 100+ levels of perk cards that I've been ignoring.
---
to be fair this issue existed back in Fo4 as well and not even modders could fix it properly.
---
Bethesda doesn't stand a chance.
---
nope just shotguns, as long as you are repeatedly hitting the same area it'll trigger, hence why shotguns needs vats because of spread where as VATS shotgun shots all hit the same spot :)
---
There are 2 numbers
---
The most popular and the one that has been around the longest is **180**
---
[The number comes from this amazing handy document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
This was taken as gospel. 
---
[Until the great Angryturtle said it was 255](https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0?t=1055)
---
Now. Neither of them show how they reached this number BUT i was more inclined to go with AT as he usually goes into great depths in his videos. SO i decided to test it myself. Three times i tried and three times i messed up BUT i can tell you that it is not 180. It might have been back in the day but it isn't now. 3 times i collected just over 180 items and the lead weights i picked up first didn't respawn. And 3 times i went over 255 and they did respawn. It sounds like a lot but it's not. The gold club has easily more than 255 items in it. The sons of dane compound out back has about 100 things. And apparently there's a house filled with books somewhere that has 300+ things in it. I am gonna find that now and test again and make sure i don't eff up.
---
yes please!
---
Good luck.
---
Marine helmet is awesome and sells well.
---
I got alot of the rare plans but missed out on the camp circus trailer.
---
What does it mean, chance to explode? Does that do AOE damage? Does it mean instant death? Like if I just melee the sqb a few times she explodes?
---
So far I have seen:  *note, I'm not on pts*
---
Mini reactor: size of 1 reactor in the silo, 100 power
---
Solar panels: 5 power, pretty small looking
---
Disease cure station: looks like the thing you get scanned in for the silo key card in initial room
---
Got a message from a new lvl20 yesterday asking if I needed any help (I'm 220) thinking he wanted to tag on and leech xp or need meds or guns I messaged him back asking if he needed anythin. Nope, nothing, just asking random people what he could do to help out for no gain.
---
I do get your kind of entitlement experience on fortnite:save the world though, every time I play
---
Ammo factory and funky duds all the way.
---
50 caps is awesome price.
---
Pretty rare item. Not many people liked the mole miner pail event to get loads of the rare plans.
---
I had friends selling them for 3-4k and they sold.
---
A prefab tab is a must.
---
We won't know if it's scrapped until it happens or they say something. Frankly it's not as if it's something thats needs to be included in the pts build as there's not much to test for it. All they would be effectively doing is disabling the debuffs and they're done.
---
Can you remind me again what they promised when? A link would be nice.
---
I only remember them ignoring anything concerning legacies.
---
You invite them? Duh!
---
It was like back in January 2019.
---
In terms of killing power, bugged aka "magic" weapons are the bigger issue right now. As they are way more powerful and causing bosses to die within seconds. But yes, i agree with you OP. Legacy weapons should do the same explosive damage as their non-legacy ballistic weapon counterparts.
---
It's great I'll never need to put on clunky power armor again. Or have to keep fusion cores. But I've got to wait until level 300 for that since the SPECIAL legendary perks are just too good.
---
well pretty soon you're gonna have 4 free fast travel points around the map to help. Foundation and Crater will be free.Also if you're in a party you can use them, their tents and camps as fast travel points. You could potentially have 13 free fast travel points if you wanna hop around.
---
I went to fight Earle and quickly found out just how underpowered my build is. So I am grateful for legacy/ magic weapons. Apart from the frame rates - aagh my poor PS4 can't cope lol
---
I spent most of my time reviving the people doing the actual damage to the SOaB, and taking pot shots at the Wendigo spawns after having tagged him.
---
No. Aluminum and lead and that's it.
---
oh that's right, no rads.
---
Never had any lag or shutdowns, and our Privates are up, up to 12hrs.
---
The only time the server shutdown is when a hotfix was pushed and crashes when we provoke it.
---
ok, go on...
---
Bulked materials, outside of lead and aluminum, only exist so they can be sold to vendors. Everything else can be be sold as is and that's why they don't bulk.
---
Well we got magic legacies as well. Whatever the case legacies gotta go first thing first
---
No joke im afraid
---
Hmmm didn't think of sneak but then again do these guns even need sneak to wreck XD
---
I'm not doing a google search for you lol it's not like I keep track of Bethesda's announcements
---
Try to get fuel? .)
---
Wow thanks for posting the links etc this is a big help, I’ve never been aware of the fact you have to pick items up for a respawn, I’ve just always guessed at a time to go back and hope they’d spawn so it’s good to know! 
---
I’m a big fan of looting everything anyway so it’s no bother for me to do that and then go back :)
---
Had it my vendor for weeks at 15k
---
You can't fix what doesn't exist, said a data miner to me when I asked a question about legacy energy weapons. They were completely removed from in game files. Bethesda would have to work hard to add them in again then adjust how they work etc.
---
Whether this is true or not it makes sense, otherwise Bethesda would of addressed it by now. Duped or not, people made huge trades for some of the legacies they have to, so removing them isn't an option either. I know you haven't said remove them but that is the only real option, the Bethesda Band Aid way. (No offence Tood, I love the game if you're reading this.) 
---
You could solve your own problem though... Buy first if you haven't already and go to a private server.
---
You can not even state what exactly they promised, and yet you start this?
---
smfh
---
I am asking because you obviously have more info than google has, I also can't remember Beth promising anything in this regard. I only remember Silence.
---
I remember someone mentioning a craft able drink that makes you immune to fear. Liquid courage I think. Used the vocal sack to make it
---
In west Appalachia, born and raised; in a bunker is where I spent most of my days
---
O_o

"Weapons: Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
* Dev Note: The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve **temporarily removed** the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied **so we can make adjustments**"
---
And such adjustments never came, we are still waiting for them as the removal was / is supposed to be temporary.
---
I'm not on the pts, and don't pay close attention to it either. So that is not first hand knowledge. Just something I saw on another comment. So I am not 100% sure if it's really a thing or not haha, but it might be
---
Most of us don't know where to spend all the caps, on my toons it's gotten to the point I removed the Travel Agent.
---
Only if they separate outfits and non legendarys. Otherwise people would just fill it with garbage to make a quick cap off your fast travel
---
I hope so. They need something to make it more interactive.  I hope it's a high yield, low duration option.
---
okay
---
Thank you!
---
When a game feels more like work it looses it's allure!
---
Yeah, pretty daft the best way of getting it is scrapping flamers for 100
---
Be scattered gp, yeah I feel you
---
Yes, and maybe even make an upgrade to rank 2 for one of them.
---
Im gonna have to carry a weaker gun then 😀
---
Lemme quote one of guys I played with recently
---
"BITCH GIB"
---
No enemy in the game should be able to take a headshot from a maxed out rifle with 95% plus accuracy with a 308 round or bigger from any distance  , there would be no head left 
---
Maybe a deathclaw or a bear could keep Coming but at a greatly reduced rate if at all
---
It does, yes. It increases the base damage for bashing and the effect adds it's to the overall damage.
---
I beleave they stay on. Only if you scrap it you get the items in inv
---
But what if bashing isn't on the weapon?
---
That's what I was worried about, that they might have got themselves stuck up a tree so to speak.
---
Well i do have 1st and I know what you're saying, but that's a bad way to look at things. We can't all just play solo on an online multiplayer game!
---
Right now, on Xbox at least, it's not uncommon to see 2 or more explosive lasers or gatling plans at a queen event. So they next duping exploit that goes public will mean that all those people will dupe theirs for quick caps and to trade etc. 
---
Also when people's bloodied and junkies builds don't seem as powerful anymore they're all going to want the big powerful legacy weapon they see the other guy using. And so it will only end up being that every other player will get their hands on them.
---
Maybe it will get to a point where when everyone has them, nobody can have them, and they will have to delete them all?
---
A more positive negative. How about the taunt one where you pretend to shoot them? Is that a nicer way to say NO?
---
But imagine the buggy mess without an delay. Could always be worse
---
In what universe is getting rid of a BE flamer that doesn't shread bosses in 3 seconds a bigger priority than an IE minigun that can shread boss in 3 seconds.
---
I say, fix magic effects first, then legacies.
---
the travel cost is designed to pull caps out of the game and reduce them in the economy, so allowing you to get em back defeats that purpose
---
They would only allow us to scrap one card per day.
---
I'd guess it just upset your standard power attack
---
think he meant the npc vendors
---
How do you know?
---
Gotcha. Did not read carefully enough. Thank you!
---
Currently in the middle of testing again and i think i've effed up again. I looted 190 things and went to check on the weights that i took first and nothing had respawned. So i went back to the book house and looted another 60 things and went back and the weights till haven't respanwed. Even tried relogging. (im in private btw). HMM! Gonna pick up some more things and try that.
---
if you spawn in at summersville you will see a house in front of you. it's filled with books and other stuff. It would probably take you 2 mins to loot the place and hit your number.
---
I was hoping this was a mod.
---
Yep, or bash it a couple of times.
---
Lol I left my loot for the first time earlier at the golf course after meeting the raider pretending to work there I go about clearing  ghouls for the mission, next thing I know first ghoul I see I pop shot because usually they'll go down but this bastard was so fast. I realized he was a level 60 ghoul big cankerous bitch, then all of sudden 4 more come blazing out like I owe them money. I'm stuck in the middle of the golf course on top of the only generator they can't reach.  I put all four of them in 2 or less hits they all run distances I can't hit them. None show up on vats I take 1 step off the generator and pop I'm dead he lays my ass all the way out for playing games.
---
Does it matter which one goes first? Why not do both? It's just that I'm dying to see legacies get adjusted cause it's been so long since they promised us a fix
---
This annoyed me when seeing the text in the Atom Shop. The most recent PA skins clearly state that they're available for all PAs. That's good.
---
The technology is there. I mean, they better fucking not have the gall of releasing the old skins as separate for whatever reason Tod conjures.
---
I'm too cynical to believe there will be any attempt to retrofit the old skins for the T65.
---
This is Bethesda we're talking about. I'd rather them not change anything since they'll probably break something I enjoy in the process.
---
Yeah, definitely try at least once or twice.   I was surprised.   I wasn't going to mess with it myself until I was encouraged to do so.   It's intense but not impossible.
---
Just thought I'd mention cos I missed a point you made there about durability. 
---
As a separate issue energy weapons, even non explosive weapons have got awfull durability and yeah that needs fixing. Energy weapons in general are awful in this game.
---
It's such a huge gap in performance between a BFFR laser rifle and a BE laser rifle. And this rebalance they're doing seems to ignore that entirely.
---
For now at least, I guess anything could happen in theory before it's all added fully Into the game.
---
Master infiltrator and far flung fireworks are definitely the ones I'm going to pick up. As someone who's friends are fairly low level and I'm unlocking most of the locks, it will very much come in handy, and I just want more explosions on my screen, besides the ones from my rifle.
---
How many hours?
---
Many of us definitely don't enjoy any of this. The game's broken already. Any change is welcome
---
Those should be Legendary Perks: Wait and Hope. They wouldn't actually do anything, but you'd have them to look at when you're disgusted.
---
Thanks anyway!! I’ll find some
---
Then it has not this specific magic effect and the bashing is useless.
---
To be magic, the heavy gun needs to have fr of around 150-200 AND be intigating, junkies, medic, or stalker OR 30%vats, limbdamage, or bashingdamage.
---
Imho the best is Junkies with limbdamage and the shredder.
---
I scrapped the thing 10 seconds after I built it bc just too damn ugly
---
Finally someone with the guts to BOOM! 🤣
---
Then they should definitely be modified to fire large balls of cats glued together :)
---
An absolute beta move right there. Nerf is gonna come no matter what. It's just that I want to see it happen come One Wasteland
---
I have magic armor on and it works that way so idk if the shredder is worth using
---
So no basically
---
Awesome read! Thanks
---
Yea absolutely!
---
I have for example a Qffr laser and even without splitter I can't shot a full mag until the laser breaks. That's really sad because in general laser weapons are my favorite weapons in most fallout games...
---
It sounds like a problem but if you check the clock on your Pipboy you will notice that you are stuck in a "Groundhog Day" style time loop.  I mean sure, the sun rises, the sun sets but it is always October 23rd 2103.  So what is a "day" anyway :)
---
WestRider85 HMU!
---
The sale I believe is coming next weekend I believe but I could be wrong. 
---
Now for the best way to use the purveyor depends on his much you trade.
---
As a trader you would be better off getting 3* weapons or armour. 
---
If you have good weapons/armour already then just just go for 3*. If you are looking for something to use though it would probably be better to roll 2*
---
Regardless the biggest tip I can give is to keep you scrip at max, then only use 150-200 a day
---
. i already own fallout first. yet due to my play style and my friends play style its not very convenient to do world bosses with just two of us even if i can facetank them.
---
Nah I totally get the nerf etc, I understand it and it needs to be done and it is coming. What I mean is I've seen posts about people complaining about other players, how they play, the weapons they use etc and it's a problem that can be fixed with 1st. They shouldn't have to go sub but if they love the game as much as they say then there is their answer.
---
I'm upset because I have respeced all my chars specials multiple times
---
So the BOS Collectron is what he calls his....’trusty fellow?’
---
Love the smug and entitled first two paragraphs. Hope your day is scrumbleful and flippity bumble as well
---
Yeah. Idk why but i take no damage from the queens acid bath when i crouch having 75. Thats just 3 peices with the effect
---
Good question...i will try next time I am on a private server. I will test on plans as well. For some reason I thought those were separate of "world" spawns
---
Now to build Lux
---
set up camp close to whitesprings station and sell all the trash legendarys for super cheap prices. i will usually buy any 3 star item for 300 caps if i see it (got about 600 ultralight weightless armor pieces in my stash) because i know eventually i can sell them or scrip them. i also sell trash items for cheap that weigh too much or is only 1 or 2 stars.
---
That sounds pretty nice. Record your adventures tho. You can make a YT channel with this stuff. Pretend you are a observer
---
I expect they are referring to people calling Fallout 76 a spaghetti nightmare of code.
---
When meat weak was still running, the guy that launched the nuke asked if we all got a shot in on Earl. Then he waited a min or 2 and just melted him in a couple of seconds. Because the cookout was about to start.
---
Probably 😂😂 I still prefer my spag bol on a plate
---
Of course we complain. I'm sick of these people one shotting legendaries and bosses. Legendaries are understandable cause they are squishy as hell but one shotting the queen or Earle is not acceptable at all and it is not for us to endure. Blood in on Bethesda's hands and they need to fix it asap. Hiding on a public server is never a solution
---
im only home a few days a week and the legendary run feels like a second job to me because ive got to make up a fair bit of score by doing the repeatable. i hit rank 78 today. probably wont get to max without spending atoms.
---
Just grind out legendaries, if you have a few friends that can play then nuke whitespring, its good for 20+ legendaries if done right.
---
Other than that the 3 best places would be whitespring, westek and the burrows. 
---
If you want to get into the trading market then get yourself to max caps and spend a few hours each day sever/vendor hopping to find bargains. I found a B/As/+1S knuckles for 600 caps. On the trading market these would net me a God roll fixer. 
---
Just hang in there it really won't be long before you are swimming in legendaries. I end up sellingnof soo many nice weapons ate dirt cheap because I need the stash space. I even have 3 full weapons mule well over 250 guns.
---
Does Ammo Factory stack with Ammosmith or is it meant to replace it?
---
ive literally just turned my xbox on if you need a private world to move an item or two.
---
Anyone else &gt;!is thinking how we made Maggie's dad into a rug for our camps?!&lt;
---
Everyone so mad they're downvoting you for speaking fact. They're just mad there's a dupe going around and they still can't afford a legacy for their Z 40 FMSWA 10mm. Legacies should be returned to the drop table when repaired, and magic guns removed.
---
Is there a video that shows these rewards?
---
guess i will just go fuck myself.
---
No at least make them sellable.
---
I ran a Instagating/limb damage minigun with 209 fr on earle last night and it didn’t do shit any reason why magic effect didn’t kick in? With all 3 heavy gunner perks maxed
---
Nice!
---
yeah... i get this problem with all my pistols... the reason it seems worse with the Gauss pistol is probably because it's so slow.
---
For some reason it hit's more often at 50-75% hit chance than 95% :p
---
If the first shot miss for me, most likely every shot will miss until i exit and enter again... if that's another miss, then exit and enter once more.
---
From the wendigos??
---
Specifically?
---
Scopes, especially long ones improves your accuracy in vats...
---
Um....
---
Is this a copy/paste of stuff that is either not true or out of date?
---
I believe they're referring to the magazine, not the weapon.
---
As long as it does not Require me to log in every day to do a daily ill be back
---
I don't like the whole floater idea. In my opinion these creatures don't fit into the world. A
---
I have an iffrfr 50 and it doesnt do shit. Magic armor or not. I'm beginning to think this magic shit doesn't do anything lol.
---
The lightning is energy damage (which it shouldn’t have)
---
Yea, kill enemies lol
---
It does. What are you trying it on?
---
IIRC correctly, Rank 1 is 1/Sec but you (Obviously) don't heal up afterwards. This is from memory when I was testing a few weeks ago.
---
And just to kick you in the nuts the plushie has a mole mine rebreather on it
---
Everything lol. I've tried it on the queen and earl. Also have a tse mini with a fire rate over 200. Magic armor also doesn't work. I only need a single peice of LDWB armor right?
---
Yeaaaahhh, they all have the same roll when dropped. Sadly they don't really have any real use or value to them.
---
I went to the house you mentioned and picked up loooooads Of textbooks, definitely 200+ there so I’ll head back to fort defiance and see if everything has respawned me! Thanks for letting me know the location of the book house :)
---
Can trade for it, very expensive though, being one shotted is normal, keep trying and you should get it eventually
---
I’m convinced they have an intern updating every inch of that page manually.
---
Yay, sounds like fun 😂
---
How much would one cost?
---
I bought my from a player vendor for 5,000 caps.    My brother got his for free from a player on a public team we joined.
---
I'll give you a plan for 2000 copper.
---
Yeah I ain't got that
---
Well looks like I'm going around player vendors then
---
Stop shaving you don't have a beard!
---
As much as I want it to, not gonna happen chief, to many bugs, plus every patch the game breaks.
---
They cost roughly 5k-7k depending on the person
---
Ah cheers
---
Armor effect only works on shotguns.
---
“Tracking Terror”? What is the quest asking you to do (check the Pip Boy text)? Also have you tried server hopping or rebooting the game?
---
That clipboard will be all he's got on him....
---
Are you a noob?
---
Sure
---
*Misunderstanding intensifies*
---
I can give ya one for 2k on Xbox
---
Because when you can one shot everything, sometimes it’s fun to run around with a paddleball at West Tek.
---
The legacy guns have a beam splitter problem, it quaruples instead of splitting the damage.
---
  [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/426171/bug-explosive-damage-is-broken-and-inconssistant?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/426171/bug-explosive-damage-is-broken-and-inconssistant?language%5B%5D=en) 
---
This explains explosive damage in more context and how it relates to legacy guns
---
The Armco ammo machine is incredibly efficient for 5.56 anyway, but I can see myself using the perk for .45 though. In my opinion, that legendary perk would come way more in handy when used in a secondary/mule character so you don't waste precious points in your main character for a perk you only need during crafting. Just my two cents.
---
Bought the same exact laptop, have the same exact problem! Have you found a solution yet?
---
Idk man, on my heavy weapon character with all the damage &amp; armour penetrating perks, 1k + rounds of my TSE .50 and 500 + round of my explosive vamp minigun didn't make much of a dent. Then the other guy left (we were only 2). So I just farmed spawn till I got bored. Or is plasma weapons Earls cryptonite?
---
I left with 400 one time 😂😂 I’m not much help for Earle but I can kill those spawns
---
Why you down vote me? I was gonna give you a plan for free. I asked if you was a noob because a noob wouldn't have anything of value to trade.
---
Wish you came eailer, just spent a bit to get more keys to start the event :/
---
Magic armor is for shotties.
---
I down voted you??? I didn't. You're on zero for me
---
Ha ha... I’m going to have to join you there
---
Weird, no worries. I'll give you a plan anyway. When can you be on for it?
---
I have a full set of +25 rad resist SS armor, so I can tell you how many rads/sec I get with it in a nuke and find out. I'll edit the comment after I test it.
---
Or make them useful would be better. They suck so much atm I feel like the enemies don't even notice them explode at their feet. Would be fun it it worked as a berserk bomb and made enemies attack each other
---
By my parts combined, I am Captain Earle!
---
Detective Douche
---
i´d made him a broadsider...
---
Go to the razer synapse program. Under system performance tab, set the refresh rate to 60Hz and the GPU to the gforce by défault for both batterie and plugged in mode. Also have to run the game in  borderless windowed and not fullscreen. Just delete both ini files in Documents and Game path if you allready have set it to Fullscreen
---
A bloodied ffr fr Gauss minigun
---
I scrap them withe the scrapper perk a and don’t get any fuel.
---
I'm on right now haha
---
Perk Coins - 
---
Even if we scrapped every card from level 51 to 415
---
* 46 packs from non-repeatable challenges  
---
* 1 for every 5 levels from 105 onwards  (62 packs)
---
* 364 single "pick a perk" 
---
* 904 cards
---
* 1808 Perk Coins
---
\- Does it look like there will be other sources of coins (challenge path, random drop from events etc?), or is it just the long slog to 415 and beyond?
---
I'll be on withing the hour. Send your gt and I'll deliver then. 👌👍
---
No it will remember. You can just use ammo converter at other ppls camps if you want
---
There's a standard backpack with I think 10 carry weight  that you can use the atom shop skins on.
---
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool / And all shooting some ghoulies outside of the school / When a couple of guys who were up to no good / Started raiding camps in my neighborhood
---
Some players have such insane prices for plans that they'll never sell them
---
Sweeeet
---
Hey do you have any extras? I am in need of this plan.
---
Really fun when this happens. Now I’m done with score I’ll started getting ore. Not many people do it now though
---
Well for me when I vats all pallets do the weapon damage. But when I don't each pallet is split damage then vs damage resistance
---
Get a set of troubleshooters armour if you struggle
---
Yooo really it doesn't work for heavy? Jesus dude this whole thing is confusing
---
There's also LOADS of stuff in the fort to pick up. There's the stuff near the lift and also the 4th floor which has a magazine and bobblehead spawn plus a plan in the PA room. 
---
so. i definitely didn't mess up this time. collected 190 things and went back to the lodge for the weights i picked up first. Nothing had respawned. I logged out and went to a public and checked. Nothing. Logged out and went back to a private. Nothing. So i went back to the book house and picked up enough stuff to get to 260 items. And the weights respanwed. So. It's definitely not 180 and it looks like 255 is the magic number.
---
Makes a lot more sense.
---
Its an annoying bug that happens in NW too.
---
If someone gets in and out of the suit, it appears again
---
People in the comments are telling me the armor doesn't apply to the weapon. Im so surprised.
---
I'm actually using it on pts and its glorious
---
best thing about it though is I made a new test character just to see how pts and on world worked on it and its so lovely having what rads / master infiltrator / survival short cut when just outside the vault - suddenly those few rads getting water seems funny and that annoying lvl 2 chest thats taunted your every new character randomly placed in the new zone you can finally seek revenge on.....
---
No not at all, it has been data mined you just get a rehashed Christmas gift with no new plans. The event was just a way for Bethesda to try and remove some of the d00ped scrap.
---
Oh right ok. I'll find some
---
Because the molecular makeup of each pellet is varying on the Kelvin scale which provides a destabilized uranium filter in the kaneuter valve. 
---
In other words, nobody knows. Long time issue.
---
I was using it last night on a new character its awesome being lvl 2 out of the vault and snapping that thing on and confusing a lvl 500 as I lockpick a lvl 3 safe for the team
---
also was funny in daily ops with a board finishing off enemies for my team in the melee kills op being lvl 3 and all
---
Then sneak attack with a heavy weapon! I so want to do a stealthy heavy weapon build LOL
---
Yea because everyone is duping wood /s
---
As I mentioned, it would be nice to have an option, so if someone it's doing the taunt you can say no or if someone invites you to trade you can politely decline
---
It's also handy for silo runs
---
I just start tossing them in the air at events.
---
One time when I did this after SBQ, 3 other people started skeet shooting my grenades out of the air.
---
Oh useful
---
If you're ahead of the spaceship then you have time. I don't remember Bethesda mentioning the specific end date beyond "mid September"?
---
It's not even a big job either.  But probably one of low priority to Bethesda at the moment.  There are lots of things taking precedent
---
ah, i practically solo-ed the entire game, slowly farmed, discovered and hang out at a region until i saw everything in it before moved on. Skipped events cuz it seemed too repetitive and didnt fit the story very well.
---
Seriously, you are going to down vote me, my god.
---
The mole miner pale where to remove caps and this is to remove scrap. People d00ped all types of scrap but it would be unfair of Bethesda to only demand the most useful stuff.
---
I just did it with a three person group. Level 248 (me), 130ish, and a level 88. We actually did pretty well.
---
Where on the map is the dev room? I’ve always wondered
---
I'm somewhere around 1500.
---
Speak for yourself. They are awesome if you know how to use them to your advantage.
---
I dropped one little nuke, they all got scared, and said "Go into the mine and shoot the monsters in there"
---
Do you have a source for the motivation in game design?
---
Also if that’s the case... why did they lower the cost of pails?
---
And then we would have a hundred posts asking for the opposite of this, a Are You Really Sure option. LOL.
---
But making a camp wall out of handful of pencils and hammer handles do. Check.
---
No, only shotguns preferably pump, and heavy weapons with fire rate over 200, we technically if u can get a rifle and hand made fire rate to 200 than yes but I dont think that's possible
---
I dunno, there is so much mis information with em. Its like they don't wanna give out the info. All I know is my iffrfr .50 doesn't do anything. At. All.
---
Me too.
---
so are you saying Lvl 1 Infiltrator (Lvl 0 locks/terminals) will automatically open lvl 0 locks/terminals but then allows me to lockpick/hack lvl 3 locks/terminals without equipping all three picklock/hacking cards?
---
\*looks at earle, who is stuck in the floor...AGAIN\*
---
It’s a fair question.
---
The 50 cal isn't magic at all lmao
---
Op speculated and I gotta say, this time he was correct.
---
“And instead he just flapped his little wings!”
---
I don’t think players are not interested in the event, just no one is willing to do silo as every time I launch a nuke every player in the server will show up
---
I didn’t get plans because I didn’t play the Christmas stuff. Will I get plans for Christmas stuff?
---
Damn, I hit 150 recently, 180 hours in
---
It fits the description, over 150 fire rate, instigating prefix, what else does it need?
---
My tse mini is over 200 fire rate and also doesnt do anything.
---
No, nothing holiday themed.
---
It has to be 180 fire rate or 100 with explosive, and the tse mini isn't magic because ts and e aren't magic, armor doesn't work on those either.
---
Actually in a public team you can open the build menu but it's empty. I personally never thought to BP anything but I guess it would be possible since you just can't place anything new.
---
Shits so confusing lmao, I just stick with my de gat plas for large mobs or my tse flamer. Just kills em a bit slower.
---
the health goes down then up lol
---
They... They look like a goat's.
---
Armor does apply to magic weapons that are under the 200 rate of fire.
---
He just wants a friend to hang out with.
---
Does ammo factory stack with ammo Smith?
---
Will using a perk like Legendary agility that ups your perk points then mean you can add more normal perks to your character? (I hope I've worded that OK)
---
Thank you for brightening my day with a reminder this exists
---
Where you find that note I need a load of them now lol
---
Blaze it 🔥
---
Pls elaborate. I can jetpack exco with the Chinese paintjob??
---
After about 5 events I felt comfortable enough to remove the tag to search for screws 😏
---
It goes both ways.  Legacies users don’t want the change cause then those guns lose all their value.  
---
Both magic weapons and legacies need to be fixed now more then ever with One Wasteland around the corner.
---
Yuck. Everytime I go into someone's camp and see one of those things it gives me the creeps. That is simply not good decorating.
---
I think it's okay as long as you don't invite her over to your place
---
That's true, but what about people trying to do the event with other events going on like meat week? Ended up getting screwed out of all my Gauss ammo and stimpaks because it was just me, my friend, and the player that launched the nuke
---
“*Intelligence is a measure of your overall mental acuity. It affects the Condition and Durability of crafted items, the amount of material gained from Scrapping, and the difficulty of Hacking.*”
---
Modifies: Item Condition and Durability, Ability to Hack Terminals, and Scrapping Return
---
Raising Intelligence decreases the number of words when hacking terminals.
---
At an Intelligence of 1 there is +0% crafted item condition bonus. Each additional level of Intelligence increases this condition bonus by +5%, except for the jump from Intelligence = 4 to Intelligence = 5, where the bonus increases by +10%. At the maximum Intelligence of 15, the crafted item condition bonus is +75%.

---
The photomode silo trick is a godsent
---
I know exactly what it means. It's a broken part of the game used because it works. It shouldn't work.
---
Well at least he has his water cooled bonesaw now to patch up any injuries.
---
3 whole times?!?
---
That’s a bug? I’ve seen so many dead legendary Scorchbeast that look like that I thought it WAS a feature. Nevertheless, definitely would be a welcome permanent addition
---
Magic needs to be removed. 100%. Legacies need to be fixed, as they said, then returned to the drop table.  Exactly as they discussed.
---
Not just bugged weapons, people are doing it with buff stacking on a stealth bloodied build.
---
Which should change with OW, thankfully.
---
They need to do something about the bullet spongeyness of the bosses though.
---
I would rather not get them for rewards at all. Grenades have always been broken for me. They either fall under the map, or after thrown continue to move with me so they dont land where I originally threw them.
---
Im 37% sure daguardey is a robot
---
How the fuck did you have enough room to place it?? I have come to the conclusion if your camp isn't the size of an aircraft carrier the rug won't fit
---
Ty, but I read somewhere that it only made the white bar on the armor you crafted, and not the total value of condition. You just gained some extra condition on top of an already "default" condition. This is not specified on the wiki, hence why I ask here for confirmation.
---
I also tested with the berry mentants that give +5 intelligence and I saw no improvement on the default armor condition bar.
---
Edit: so basically I wonder what they mean with "condition". Once its broken, does it has the same total condition as another armor crafted with less intelligence? Im trying hard to word myself correctly to avvoid missunderstandings.
---
I did EVERY SINGLE DAY that didn't auto complete for me and I am still at 93/100. This is pathetic. I literally would have to play every. Single. Day. At this point.
---
I have grinded over 6500 screws so far.
---
Honestly the only thing i have to gripe about is the framerate 80% of the time i feel like im playing on a slideshow projector same issue on both consoles I haven’t bothered buying on pc because i heard when it launched it bricked peoples computers 😭 so im not taking the risk
---
I had this same problem, they are daily quests I believe, i found out by checking the black boxes on the map.
---
Honestly. I like how they tried making explosives and even explained how "powerful" they are. However they didn't mention that you need all the grenade associated perks in order to not just tickle your enemies. I would rather use a pipe revolver then those grenades, well at least until they buff then I'll use them
---
Definitely.
---
No 3 attempts each time I failed
---
I run just these 3, with class freak to dampen the negs it works well.
---
Seriously something to consider. Just because the game isn't meant for children doesn't mean they can't get their hands on it, and what the player said does sound like a child.
---
ProzacPromises ... hit us up
---
If i was in a nuclear apocalyptic wasteland and ive just arrived home to my floating house after murdering a giant dragon and also a giant wendigo thing all the while being hopped up on buffout,bufftats,psycho,med x,psychobuff and all the alcohol i can carry id sleep in my regular clothes too on top of the covers
---
I understand, but I don't think the issue is on vendors but Stash management. In my opinion, we should have the possibility to choice to bulk every junk to save weigth in our stash. Besides, I think it will improve the search of junk in Stash and player's vendor machine. Maybe, craftable with 1 plastic instead of 2...
---
Nobody,... Move,.... A,.... Muscle.
---
It's perfect
---
It took me 20 minutes to remember that I was in the rusty pick to buy legendary modules last night
---
"You shot mah pops and made him into a rug!"
---
Meh
---
Yeah that is so confusing to me, especially when they are high level players.
---
Bethesda pay attention to this idea. Its actually a good suggestion.
---
Agree
---
True I see all these post like legacies are monsters . Maybe in pvp I don't know.
---
I hardly see them used at boss events because explosive is crap on them.
---
So what is it left? Normal mobs. People are really mad for how you kill normal mobs? As you said they can be two shotted even with the worst weapons.
---
Especially since it's difficult to make caps in the first place, also 12000 caps for some signs from the station vendors?!?!
---
Without actually doing the math, I’d say yes but it’s gonna be close
---
I have a collection of 1* furious rolling pins at 30k caps, im up to 5 of them now.
---
Same thing in FO4. This "range" stat they added is just bullcrap with how close the falloff starts to hit at times. It also renders shotguns falling straight into [this always relevant Nerfnow comic.](https://www.nerfnow.com/comic/748)
---
It doesn't matter because almost every update (delayed or not) comes out broken and adds more problems then fixes. I honeslty don't know what your talking about.
---
I gotta be honest, fusion cores are one of the things that I hate with a passion about fallout 76. It was painfully obvious to almost everyone that having the gatling laser use fusion cores was a heavily flawed and buggy idea in fallout 4, and so why in the hell they used that same concept and expanded it into now also being plasma cores is confusing as hell to me. There was a very obvious and simple solution to the fusion cores issues; bring back electroncharge packs. And just have fusion cores for power armour. Then you don't have to deal with reloading your gatling laser and it using a near empty core that has 10 shots left in it. Or the bug of ammo disappearing into thin air, or being forced into a reload when the ui claims there is still a few hundred rounds left. 
---
Bit of a rant, sorry.
---
I just called my girlfriend after giving this a read. 
---
"I love you dearly, with all of my heart," I said.
---
"Did you read reddit again," she replied.
---
...
---
That would be the Hallucigen gas grenade.
---
Have u done to house party quest
---
This figures as I got my third cursed harpoon gun along with a broadsider and a fatman after one ACP event.
---
That benefits the player! We ought to fix that...
---
One you contribute to the SF world don't count your self out brother.
---
Two just try the build and see if you like it. If not save the perk points and move them back. There will be sacrifices in other area to make a build. Th idea of the FO76 perk system. Can't be too OP.
---
Just need your bloodied melee friend as Maze hahaha that's awesome
---
Thank you, it worked. Didn’t need to run it in a window though! 🙏🙏🙏🙏
---
The watoga one is the first to come to mind, there is one on a PA stand where you get the excavator armor that's been that way since BETA so I assume some of its intentional and some of its a bug.
---
Ah crap I'll have to heal up to get there I run at 28 health
---
In ellie's bunker or whatever it was called for the enclave questline
---
didnt work in fullscreen for me. Had to set it up in Borderless Windowed
---
Wrong it goes both ways you can’t and neither can they be harmed
---
Thats quality even better than insult bots one XD
---
* fast travel bug
---
* no respawn bug
---
* VATS
---
   * initiate VATS
---
   * 95% hits chance should mean 95% hit chance
---
   * game freezing in VATS
---
* lag in general
---
   * it's been weeks since I saw a player run in a fluent manner and not in jerks.
---
* all the pop-ups reworked so that the least destructive option is the default highlighted option.
---
   * for example "NO i do not want to drop and destroy this skinned legendary weapon" should be default, not "YES destroy my favorite weapon"
---
* daily blue screen(s)
---
* ammo converter UI
---
   * why not a simple trade menu with ammopoints instead of caps?
---
* loads of OCD-type changes like the build menu that is chaotic or even the menu when modding weapons (order of mods is inconsistent).
---
* simple balancing. just raise the effectiveness of under used legendary prefixes. For example the slayer types could be 100% extra damage against that type of enemy.
---
* stimpacks quick button in busy events/locations. I don't like clicking it 5 times to eventually, when the game feels like it, get extra health from one of them.
---
Gauss ammo is really a pain. I love my gauss minigun but the ammo consumption is too high and I’ll probably keep it in my stash box until legendary perks  released
---
Anyone know if the cryolator is working down there? I can’t get him to go cold like I do with the above ground spawn
---
What nozzle are you using? If you’re using any of the 2 that boost damage then it’s not “broken,” you’re just remodeling it to glitch out the range every time you log in
---
Can you find that reduction on armor?
---
Nothing gets heavier when Bulked. Aluminum and Lead get lighter though.
---
Or running on top of the corpse I'm trying to loot.
---
Perhaps I miss spoke my point is that with my 1 hour a day that I can play, if i spend every minute just trying to complete every challenge then I don't have time to do my other "grinding" tasks. Also when I do actually get the chamce to play longer I dont want to have to stop just because I'm about to level up again. The point of the game is to be entertaining not a second job! Now that I think about the repeatable challenge is probably what allowed me to complete the season as well so maybe it should remain repeatable. As for the FO1st "outcries" all I can say boohoo! There is no reason why anyone should be mad about FO1st there is nothing "pay to win" about it. If anything its "pay to be more convenient" I played FO76 for awhile without it the only reason I bought it was due to Wastelanders and the quarantine. Trust me I hate "play to win" mechanics but my having FO1st takes absolutely nothing away from other players.
---
Yeah I was bummed when I saw that.  I’m running heavy weapons and currently at 14 str all used.  I was looking forward to pushing that up to 20 ....  
---
But at least I could move a point from somewhere else (perhaps luck) and then put a luck legendary perk in to push that up, etc.
---
Sadly a mixed set of forest and urban scout armor doesn't count as a matched set.  I fully understand why it doesn't, but since you can change urban to forest with the "no paint" glitch it does _look_ matched.
---
Yep I just want my blackbird paints on my t65
---
This is nor correct:

 **Power Armor Reboot** \- 15/20/25/30% chance to auto-revive with full health if you die in Power Armor.

It's in the latest PTS!:

 **Power Armor Reboot** \- 15/20/30/40% chance to auto-revive with full health if you die in Power Armor.
---
Get the missile silo state holotape from the whitesprings bunker and it tellls you when youre able to launch a nuke from each silo again
---
I go commando a lot when playing games
---
It definitely worked.  Now I'm getting some slow framerates so going to have to lower some other settings but so much better even with some stutter.
---
It would be very helpful. Especially cool if we got a Bandalier backpack skin
---
I really wish that perk loadout they promised us was already available.  It would be a great quality of life improvement
---
What's the max scrip?
---
While we are at it.  Just stop giving random shit as quest rewards.  Even at low level I never wanted the random piece of armor, pipe pistol, and missiles/nukes/etc from a quest.  Ever.   
---
Give us plans, give us scrip, give us legendaries, give us caps.
---
The math doesn't seem to favor you.
---
Iirc T-51 gives 181 rad resist and I roll it in nuke zones.
---
Eventually you can only reduce the trickling in rads by so much with resist, you'll always keep getting a little.  This perk that removes rads per second will be great for that
---
Can you swap out legendary perks at any time like regular perk cards?
---
1000
---
It's weirder why they do it without pillows. I've seen pillows out in the world. I *know* they still exist!
---
Does it remove Rads?
---
Just happened. Was working fine yesterday but not today...
---
Okay so my 182 laser is magic
---
Tell that to Bethesda...lol!
---
Was thinking this same thing last night playing. Might take a week off of no intentional season grinding. We can still unlock rewards without even trying sometimes though so that will be a please surprise.
---
Phattybluntz
---
You can scrap it but it doesn't yield anything, it just goes away.
---
How many special points will you have to move? On my melee toon, I can just swap out cards to either go unarmed, 1handed or 2handed without swapping special points around. My main has been running shotguns since the beginning. Guess melee is a tad different in that aspect. Take a screenshot of your current set up in case you don’t like it after you switch. Never built a heavy gunner or commando so I’m not sure on how you’re set up. GL man
---
Just wanted to say... THIS WORKS!!!
---
I've honestly just started avoiding vendors when I see 300+ plans. Usually means they have 45 mounted tics for 100 caps each.
---
Dang that's not a lot thanks tho.
---
This. Somethings things have to be ironed out as they go rather then delay and repeat several times over.
---
This is exactly the kind of content I needed this morning. Thank you. 😂
---
Same but i was done after bloodied berf
---
P L E A S E A S S U M E T H E P O S I T I O N
---
And once again, pa builds get screwed and mele still has the most.
---
Maybe the next boss could have spawns that drop lead!
---
Oh no
---
Cave feel like 'The deep/hopewell'(or just something interiors) might be pretty cool since all others are on the surface
---
For the unique resource, I can only came with ideas of mystery meats(or something like mush bars in the oxygen not included game) and bug parts. Well it will be useless, but somewhat good to be exist I guess
---
Does the legendary strength perk and such allow you to Pick ekstra perks in your build?
---
There's some really good strategies for making caps pretty easily. I max out every couple days, shop for bargains on redditt/player vendors, then rinse and repeat.  Shoot me a message if you're interested in hearing any of them.
---
The run should have given you enough atoms to buy up to 10 ranks if it looks like you're going to run out of time.
---
Nice. 
---
My friend just hit level 69
---
Take that as you will
---
I wish there were another way.
---
If it has the right talents and any piece of armor has that has blocking effect or watever its called.
---
My understanding is that bloody mess is going to be much less effective after the upcoming damage nerf, so I eliminated it from my build and swapped it for good with salt.
---
Those greenhouse walls and the bunker are calling my name
---
There is two true endgames for 76. 
---
Good or Evil. Settler vs raider.
---
You can choose to help the noobs and play with 
---
Or 
---
You can destroy them and play against.
---
Honestly, I just want crafting perks to be separated from other perks. I hate having to restack cards just to build a new turret or repair my armor to 200%.
---
I didnt know that. So i feel like i won't be able to finish in time where can i do that? On bethesda? I didnt see that on atoms shop
---
So yes it does?
---
I’m gonna find your GT, PSN, IGN. Whatever the fuck it is. If you’re not on Xbox, I will buy a PS4, or make myself a PC. Then I will proceed to spend £200 on gear and aid to get myself the most powerful character you’ve ever fucking dreamed of. Then I will stalk you and make sure you never get another kill. All without using legacies.
---
It's a bug that we're even getting them in the loot lists!
---
They're a gold bullion reward [that I'm thankful I never bought after this demo], as they're so bad, worse than frag grenades!
---
I did it solo and it was way easier than with a team. Not sure if it was because there was only me for him to go after so I wasn’t chasing him. It did feel like he had way less health than in a team.
---
They seem to only project if they load in after walls/floors etc.
---
well I got a mutant’s trapper left leg 1* yesterday
---
Perk coin should be accounted wide like champion point in eso 
---
Expecting rebuild of the legendary Perk system next year
---
What is v9?
---
I get steel for mine
---
It's a glitch that they're in the loot list to begin with, they're a gold bullion reward.
---
Your absolutely right.!
---
Do the legendary special perks still leave the base special cap at 15 or boost it to 30 with the maxed out card?
---
With all the explosive perks, they're still worse than a frag grenade!
---
Hang on.... We *don't* have this yet??
---
WTF I just realised that we don't. Yep. Upvotes all round.
---
The only reason I have the game is that my friend wanted me to play it with him given that I'm such a FO fan (Played them all through the years). So playing with them was half the fun. Of course me screaming obscenities in discord voice was probably another bonus for them.. :)
---
The flamer is the best. Hands down. I’ve had both for a very long time and the flamer is the king in my opinion.
---
People griping about fuel cost need to use the ammo converter. Within a day of that coming out I had 10k fuel with enough ammo points to continue for a very long time. 
---
It’s not supposed to be the only gun you use though. If you want to main a legacy I think the only viable option is the plasma gat due to its durability and ammo availability.
---
it is silly to remove the negatives.
---
leave it alone.
---
Non legendary armor and weapons are fine I'd you're near a workbench, as then you can learn mods!
---
Isnt 500 atoms around the last 10?make it to that buy the last few levels if your short on the last day.u might be ok just get the dailies out stay in a full building group and get the max xp you can
---
Ooof yea I forgot you need perks for nades... I wish more perks were passive. Crafting stuff especially
---
Noob means...well we are still not sure but it's not something nice.
---
Say newbie next time.🌝
---
Just wanted to add, intelligence adds an experience gain bonus (2% per point, iirc).  With the new rare perks coming levels will be more useful after 50.
---
No.  You'll get at most one level per day at such a high rank.
---
It was probably a kid lol 
---
Lots of young kid seem to play this game
---
This seems about right but seen them as high as 14kcaps.im sure some one would pay.lol
---
I used to run ops with two to three other guys. We'd pretend to be a fireteam decked out in X-01 out looking for supplies and get the Sunshine Meadows line running.  
---
That way we got a load of rad free salisbury steak and purified water, and we passed those out in the forest area, acting like we were a federal checkpoint distributing supplies to new arrivals.  
---
Simple premise, but it was always fun. We either got in fights over the factory line, or we'd have some good chats with new toons.
---
Pretty sure you just hit "Rank Up" on the board.  On PC I believe it is the R key.  Not sure on consoles.
---
Apparently the modded ones are actually pretty good. But you could only learn the mods when you couldn't scrap it, and now that you can scrap it you can only learn the mods from dev room plans
---
I want a weapon weight backpack. I never seem to need less ammo, but it doesnt weigh ANYWHERE near a rw handmade. Xd
---
Some believe the purveyor is seeded.when I get a bloodied drop or junkies I run to the purveyor. Aslo if I get a handmade from a legendary I run to the purveyor. Usually it works out for me..just random as fu
---
master infiltrator looks really good
---
*groan*
---
no
---
I think it's any mix of +agl, reduced weight, swing speed, and limb damage
---
Is there a better alternative?
---
That is so fuckin sexy. I gave up lockpicking and hacking awhile ago out of annoyance. This will definitely be the first I take!
---
Power armor reboot works instantaneously, so you never go down, so it doesn'trigger revenant( I suggested it should anyways on the PTS forum , haha, would be epic). 
---
Power armor reboot doesn't affect rads at all, its awesome for bloody PA. 
---
The player gets the damage bonus from take one for the team, Its great for joining a public team then doing your own thing. I think everyone gets the bonus no matter if they're a teammate, but that might be wishfull thinking, not actually 100% sure.
---
If you have the game on both Steam and Bethesda, then yeah, you should be fine.
---
Just that once you de-link them, what you currently have is tied to the Bethesda version. The Steam version once unlinked will have no characters.
---
And I'm not sure what would happen if you made steam character then tried to link it with an existing bethesda characters, one would overwrite the other.
---
What I did do was make a new Bethesda account (new account so no games) and link that to my steam version. This allowed me to name my account, so no weird alpha-numeric string.
---
Interesting, so the cursed harpoon gun won't suffer that massive delay if reloading with speed demon
---
Oh i seee thanks man u saved me. And its just for 150 atoms
---
It will be a killer if this goes.
---
This is with a real weapon right?
---
Thanks why building group tho i dont understand
---
You  have to hit the same body part continuously.  Also, lag is a big factor in whether you  trigger magic or not.
---
Yeah, the current metal building kit we have looks toi clean and like it was only just manufactured by a high tech company. It looks too pre war.
---
At least 21, to make all the SPECIAL points count.
---
I’d avoid using the special formula route.  
---
Makes protecting animals harder.  Yes they heal but they attack instead of running away.
---
Yknow who needs nades when you have a magic laser mingun
---
I smell a commie!
---
I got the plan for ultracite Gatling laser gun.
---
Or Mayor De Blaseo of NYC
---
Are you selling those plans? Im only missing those 2 plans from the event.
---
I've never seen the artillery work even near the camp...
---
Ah that explains why my flamer is the weapon that damages Earle the most. And it will melt a regular wendigo in under 4 seconds p.
---
I have a theory.
---
When you are in vats, it appears every pellet does weapon damage.  This we are sure of.
---
I think when you aren’t in vats, each pellet that hits is showing full damage on the health bar for a moment, like if you were in vats.  But the game is only registering normal damage.  Because the game isn’t running the two codes simultaneously, you’re seeing the health bar show one thing, then correcting itself when it finishes the damage calculation.  I think the lag is caused by the game running these calculations 8/9 times per shot, instead of 1/2 times per shot, as normal.
---
This might also explain part of magic weapons with &gt;200 (160) fire rate.
---
Wow, that’s a lot point swapping... definitely take a screenshot before you move anything just in case, lol. Most I’ve ever moved is a couple here  and couple there
---
Any chance to have some more info about this one?:
---
 **Survival Shortcut** \- Generate 1/1/1/2 survival aiding chem(s) every 30/25/20/20 minutes. Up to a max of 5/6/7/10. (*The chem cures all diseases and completely restores your health, hunger, and thirst.*) 
---
It sounds very good tho, does it mean you don't need to carry food or drinks anymore? Just use this?
---
2 animals alive can still give top rewards.  It’s just drastically reduced, but it can happen.  
---
All u really need is 3 people with decent builds that can handle the rooms their in.  
---
I’ve complete this with all 3 alive plenty of times with just 2 other teammates.
---
I turned in 2000 cloth last night. All I got was alcohol.
---
For the INT. More INT = more xp. Also if you get in a large group for an event like colossal problem pop a lunchbox.  You can get 100% bonus xp from the very well rested buff.
---
The best gun is the gun that kills enemies before they kill you.
---
What perks are you using with your handmade ?
---
What's so insane to me about the people that have played this failed alpha test game is that none of you can admit that there is no end game content at all.  There's no raiding, no dungeons, no changing vault to raid and explore, there's nothing but hoarding and bad minecraft base building stapled onto a bad mmo.  It's cool to help people, but because there is literally no reason to play this game once the main quest is complete.
---
sure ;-)
---
This joke isn't even funny when its told *right*.
---
There's a hidden rad resist effect to power armour and hazmat suits not shown with the in game stats that accounts for their higher resistance.. Like a certain percentage resist of 40 or 50 or so
---
Could be the game trying to load more audio than it can handle.
---
In my case, imagine the .50cal with it's 91 rate of fire, 9.1 shots per second. (per wiki, under the expanded legend)
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_weapons](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons)
---
Now add to that, that it was shooting like a shotgun instead of a normal gun, so x8 pellets per shot.
---
And add to that, that it was also explosive legendary effect, so on impact, the game is trying to play the shot audio and explosive audio.
---
9.1x 8 x 2 = \~145 sounds  per second the game is trying to load an play.
---
I'm guessing the game basically can't handle it and it starts lagging things
---
I believe it’s mandatory to get the backpack skin though.
---
Honestly none that pertain to weapons i more focused on health and carry weight
---
I wasn't crouching though. I was standing in plain sight with my weapon sheathed.
---
That would cause more people to hold onto more weapons which impacts stability.
---
Taking lockpicking would be foolish for anyone on PC if you ask me.  While I have absolutely no doubt that they will go out of their way to find some way to make the perk loadout system thoroughly dreadful, the perk loadout mod that already exists makes lockpicking and hacking perks largely irrelevant already.
---
Damn I'll have to give that a try, thanks for the tip.
---
i uploaded some photos. i hope now it is better &lt;3
---
Why seperate it, we should get all 3 imo.
---
Yeah I’ve only run a few games on console because of things like this. Granted not all of them are bad with people cheating. There are still a select couple matches that definitely frustrate me. I’m sure it’s a lot worse on PC though, unfortunately.
---
If you're a PA user I'm surprised you weren't more excited about the poison resistance. Bloodied PA here and I just eat shit from poison enemies all day
---
i have photos now! &lt;3
---
the other way around...
---
I havent even completed it once. I've just been paired up with lazy or incompetent people its honestly annoying
---
Oh you want to complete this for the quest? Sorry all of us are gonna AFK and let you alone deal with this event
---
Cheers lol, pissee me off
---
Me: Fucking do it you little toe rag. I dare you.
---
I am. 1000 caps each. Mack012166. I’ll be on this afternoon around 2 eastern.
---
The Shoveler, anyone? No Mystery Men fans around here?
---
I disagree with the pickaxe. It's quiet and you can easily reach 20k+ sneaky power attacks on Super Mutants.
---
He thinks he’s superior to us. He’s filthy Enclave.
---
Of course pacifist mode wouldn't work, I'm not sure why you mentioned it in the first place.
---
As for being cautious, I can hardly control when the event starts. I arrived, made my way to the plastic, then the event started. That's hardly my fault.
---
Or the flamer. Really opens up a few neglected weapons
---
He is basically saying 3 isn’t a lot.  Personally I got lucky and got it on my second try.  I haven’t seen it again in 30 plus tries.
---
Some people are very unlucky and can do it 50 or more tries and never see the plan.  It has a low drop, that’s why it goes for 5-7k on player vendors.
---
Yes. I am in Germany. So if we could find a time slot that works for you, that'd be amazing
---
I tried it once, but then someone dropped a nuke and I decided the event was taking too long, so I bailed.
---
I’ll give you those fusion cells... Lemme just unload them into your face.
---
My 5 wwr armors would like a word lol
---
Plus, it's not much but the 100 score for every 10000 ex helps a little. Take workshops to defend them and get the exp. I stayed around Watoga and north of there to kill and get that exp. I only did building teams for the Int and sleep until rested for that 5% Exp bonus for a hour (2 if you are well rested).
---
You obviously haven't fired explosive legacies before. The explosive damage is so ridiculous that even Fireproof 3 and Dense mod on your chest won't save you.
---
Did u get bored once in the game? Like I am interested in the game but I look at it from a mmo point of view I play mmos normally where content is infinite. Does this game have alot of updates and events and stuff that keeps u interested or do u hit endgame and at a certain point kill the same boss over and over and that's it till a new boss comes out?
---
I just wanna know more about the game from a high level perspective because I'm interested and a  games endgame is very important to a grinder like me.
---
We don’t have this issue on console.
---
I use those and also grabbed Herbivore (that 25% xp buff from cranberry relish tho), and Herd Mentality.
---
Herd mentality is actually broken with public teams, even if your the only one in a public team it still triggers.
---
I'm glad I could help brighten your morning
---
Definitely commando or rifleman (depends if it’s full or semi auto) and demolition expert for the explosive shots
---
This doesn’t happen on console.
---
BTW grats on 420 :D
---
Oh i get it. Thanks a lot
---
But the professor added one extra ingredient CHEMICAL X
---
Not the exact same thing, no. But there are cheaters on console.
---
Well there's your problem. QOL perks won't help you kill the enemy.
---
Because they've already drained the caps, now they can do it at appropriate prices I assume
---
Did the event first time yesterday - made a few mis-steps but no biggy - go so excited when Earl fell - I forgot to loot him. (Oops)
---
Question for the veterans - is there more than one way out? I booked it to the entrance and barely made it in time.
---
Wazer Wifle
---
Ah got you!
---
That pretty much sounds like my first character.
---
Was focused so much on exploration, so I SPECIAL-ed into carry weight and crafting. Didn't really start looking into builds till level 70-ish.
---
Now, when looking at builds, it's probably best to start with, How do you like to play?
---
Stealthy kills?
---
Punching things to death?
---
Run and Gun?
---
Walking slowly and laying waste to anything that moves?
---
Based on how you like to play the game, the weapons/build you would want will change.
---
What they need to do is do like a quad xp  in nw so those of us that don’t  cheat can lvl up quickly and get the rewards and be done with nw. The cheaters are already per 100 on here
---
It's common enough that I now have an endless burning hatred for Mirelurk Kings.
---
What do these cheaters do?
---
Thank u very much! I will try that too :)
---
XP score is repeatable, that will likely be the key to completing in time.
---
Grind LITS 
---
Grind Guided Meditation
---
Grind for grind sake.
---
Yup got rank 100 and now taking a break too
---
Monster Mash made a Public event before they actually fix PvP would be a huge disaster IMO. It'll both be not fun at all and a  fantastic XP farming event will be gone forever.
---
But if they actually fix PvP, I guess there could be room for it to be fun.
---
Make sure you don't have an old unfinished daily from him from 5 months ago. You can either complete it or abandon it.
---
It weird used a flamer one for ages then traded for a plasma, its great for carpet bombing and like you said ammo is a lot easier I just sometimes miss the range and accuracy of the flamer, gets annoying sometimes the gatling start up
---
The alcohol is to help ease the pain of being grifted by the BOS and get you drunk enough to do it again I bet.
---
According to this, we have a week: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html?
---
I've been tearing my hair out trying to fix this myself and as annoyed as I am that there's no fix that I can see I'm glad that it's not just my game settings.
---
I think they meant crafting rather than scraping 🙂
---
Total/Max condition on an item when crafted is luck based (I believe)
---
Intelligence, is as you state, determines the starting condition.
---
Ha! #truth
---
The spin up is a killer imo. I managed to get a VE flamer recently and it’s truly incredible to use against Earl. Keeps me alive and deals great damage as well. I typically switch between that and my .50 cal.
---
Not to mention all that duped glass and leather.
---
Yeah I always cringe when my character gets into her perfectly clean bed while still having the jetpack, backpack and cowgirl boots on 😬
---
It's real. Saw someone mention it on the official forum and one of the community managers responded. It has a really short duration right now (60 seconds), but they are going to make it more in line with other alcohol buffs, so probably 3 minutes by the time it's live.
---
Where are these people on PC? I play through XBox Game Pass, so I'm not sure if that matters, but most of the time the high level people I see on are sticking to their camps or nuking sites and soaking in rads. I almost never just "run into" someone out there.
---
Nope, was wrong. Luck affects the durability of picked up items.
---
Ah, so the 20% fire rate on the harpoon is pretty pointless then?
---
Save em for when a newbie is taking forever at a vendor.
---
Sometimes it's enough for them to back out to see wtf is going on and youn c an swoop in
---
I was hanged up on last night by a squad of people using paddle balls. I grabbed a boxing glove to fight back. The whole time no one swapped to another weapon so it was just really random. But also very fun
---
The problem is the use of trainers in general or more so the people that make them.
---
The way they bypass any form of security and manipulate a games internal files into thinking it's running as per normal is incredibly hard to stop, take a look at GTA online for PC as the best example of this.
---
I know people like to bash Bethesda for incompetence but I honestly believe if it wasn't for the use of VPNs and they were able to track these people down they'd be sued to oblivion.
---
I am, actually.
---
What a ridiculous bug.
---
It is cool fo have more weight reduced backpacks, but when will power armor get some 😭
---
But doesn't the Harpoon gun have a max of 1 shot?
---
To encourage the use of VATS?
---
In addition, so many headlines for the categories look similar on first glance.
---
Doors, floors, roofs. Stairs, chairs 
---
So often miscliked..
---
Without VATS, most shotguns just shoot cotton candy anyways
---
Underwear? I'm not just Free States, I'm also Free Ballin.
---
Any junk that is actually useful has been duped.
---
Also all the various animal skin rugs get their own spot in floor decor. They should share a spot and I scroll through. Simple thing that would vastly clean up the menu. Many more examples like this
---
This. Will grind for this.
---
...to be real will probably grind for anything that comes with the BoS but that's just my unhealthy addiction to the grinds BGS throws my way....
---
Fast travel never fixes it for me (or at least when it does it when I'm using a bench and the owner logs off) but drawing my weapon does.
---
It took me a while to figure that out. I spent like 20 minutes just skimming around shaking my beaker until I button-mashed my way back to normal.
---
Even with a heavy hitter I do a bit of damage to him and then shift focus to the adds for ammo, screws and acid.  Pretty much guaranteed someone will take him out with a magic weapon within a few minutes anyways and I want loot lol
---
 I've only done the event once with two lower level strangers where I needed to actually unload on him.  Every other run has been done in like 2 to 5 minutes.
---
Idk about best but I’ve been using a bloodied Gatling and I kill high level super mutants and scorched with one bullet. Super ammo efficient lol
---
Bethesda has no anti-cheat system. They are probably flooded of players reports man. Bethesda needs an anti-cheat system to work with.
---
As you wish my lord you are so great we peasents shouldn't even come near you we are trully sorry please accept our apolgy
---
Try to get at least 3 people with a flame weapon in each habitat with friendly fire equiped.
---
Think you get around 2%per intelligence points.i had 5 intelligence perk cards so that's 10%off the top then in a group of 4 it's about 8% so 18% and with my unyielding gear it's a extra  15% so in a group of 4 I'll get around  a extra 33%xp add lunchbox and you keep adding from their. Cranberry relish can add bonus xp as well
---
It’s not useless
---
Shouldn't always come out bad either. You'd think our character would get the hang of this cooking thing by now
---
Congrats! I reached level 100 and rank 100 at the same time and it was a double reward. Im so happy even though ill litereally never use the fireplace door (even tho i was so excited for it, where am i going to put it in my shack of a camp??) or most of the things because i DID it and the stuff i do want looks great.
---
Are you playing on a brand new PC/Laptop?
---
Can you clarify how the purveyor loot pool works? Was told that you can’t get a drop unless you know the plan; but I’ve gotten drops for weapons I’ve yet to learn. Does that only affect non-vanilla weapons like the fixer?
---
Thank you here's an upvote
---
Lol thanks
---
Big No thank you - then only high level players can have them. If you really want limited workshops - then I want worlds where there's a smaller range of character levels.
---
I'm only a level 34. High level players have been great for the limited time I've been playing - they either don't grief me or leave drop some basic plans or water.
---
Then the last couple days, 2 different high levels watched me claim the Junk workshop. (It was unoccupied.) Each time, I did the defend event. Then I build the 3 junk processor things and their generators.  Both dudes came in and smoked me. That's not fun to me. (These were 2 different worlds - 2 different players)
---
I enjoy going to camps, take all apparel/armour off character and sleep in other players beds.
---
have had some entertaining responses. From LOL to messages telling me to get my cooty ridden ass off the bed, to immediate disconnects.
---
😂 Got it! I will grind for all cost :)
---
So does the legendary strength go past 15 or will it still cap at 15
---
Honestly, I would wait until the legendary perks drop. There will be six legendary slots and you can have legendary special cards that give you up to +5 points you can use for perk card placement.
---
Rated M for mature. Online interactions not rated by ESRB. Don't let your kid play online games if they can't handle any possible consequences.
---
Wow i didnt even now i should build intelligence for xp i always thought only events group should give xp s. Thanks
---
  
---
I'd invest in a couple points in Commando or Rifleman perks.
---
Have a look at :   
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Not nearly as well as with a queen fight. You’re better off saving those cryo cells.
---
Look up angry turtle magic effects on YouTube
---
I already divorced that shit once.
---
Where do you find this guy ?!
---
Floaters are pulled directly out of old school Fallout canon so...
---
You still have to learn the rest of them.
---
Making explosives actually good would work for me too, but yeah, the prompt should go.
---
prob a better bet to post in market place and trade someting.
---
Of all flux in game, i have never seen Violet in players vendors.
---
Good luck. I was lucky that an online friend let me nuke and farm for a couple of hours. BUT..a few Earle's has eaten it all now :(
---
Lately a good run will get me 5 (HRF dependant) at SBQ
---
Wow. Survival Shortcut just jumped itself into my must-take list, although I can't imagine that doesn't get toned down somewhat before release.
---
No, unless you grind the hell out of yhe repeatable. Just doing the other challenges you'll get up like 5 levels.
---
We’re supposed to be rebuilding America, they would’ve taught us how to build something at least structurally decent in the vault. There’s no need for that crappy wood and metal shacks whenever our dwellers would realistically know how to build a normal house, even if it’s small and basic
---
&gt; **I didn't realize it until recently, but the true, and best, endgame is helping other people progress.** 
---
That may be true but the true secret endgame are the friends you made along the way.
---
Armor Ace, lots of Commie stuff, likely starts next Tuesday
---
Literally every single weapon including explosives have weight reduction (fucking pistols, really Bethesda?) Perks EXCEPT ballistic rifles. Fucking stupid. Tank killer should have reduced weight for rifles built-in.
---
lol yea “mission accomplished”. You conspiracy theorists are funny.
---
Personally I only buy 100 scrip weapons. Some say the third star doesn't really add much value/benefit so if you're low on scrip or don't really care about the third effect, you could buy the 60 scrip weapons and still get good weapons. When I'm at the Purveyor, I'll buy 2 things and if they're undesirable I'll stop for the day. If I'm getting good prefixes, I'll continue buying. Maybe it's superstition,  maybe it has something to do with the way drop rates are calculated, but it works for me.
---
The sale will happen when we reach the leather goal in Fortifying Atlas. The sale is planned for September 10-14.
---
Yes, its live in the PTS,  we get a few weeks break before it starts, check in YouTube for a full run through on rewards.
---
Level stops meaning anything after a while, it’s all about having the right perks and builds so your weapons and armor can handle anything.
---
As someone whos been playing for the entire time the games been out and only hitting level 100 this month- i feel that casual no specification life every day and fear the right side of the map.
---
looks like people can’t take a joke
---
What kind of setup you running?
---
Rifles first. Power armor already has weight reduction perks.
---
Purveyor sale is scheduled for Sept 10-14
---
From what I heard its at least fixed in the PTS.
---
Only took them... *nearly two damn years*.
---
It should still be challenging, enjoy it because late game is soon freaking boring
---
There are plenty of cheaters without VPN.
---
&gt; i kill high leveled scorched in a few seconds but when i use the handmade it takes me a couple minutes to kill one
---
Honestly, taking "a few seconds" is still too long for a TTK, in my opinion anyway.
---
I play the full meta build (bloodied stealth commando), and I one shot max-level scorched with a single bullet. Note that I'm *commando*, not rifleman, so the fact that I still 1-hit things with an automatic gives you some idea of how OP that build is.
---
From the info so far it be it depends on how fast you clear them 
---
But top reward will have legendary scrip and gold bullion
---
Underarmor linings aren’t like some of the other plans in the game. You can learn them out of order.
---
Sure. Make yourself some cranberry relish and I’ve got a few leadership bobbles. If you can get +INT unyielding armor, it will go even faster. I can’t spend a ton of time on it with work, but I can get you an hour of grinding mobs. 
---
I don’t have FO1 any longer, but I’ll see if I can get someone that does so it’s a private server.
---
Wow, so Survival Shortcut means you never need to worry about food or water again. That is a pretty epic QOL perk.
---
I mean when will it get it's own type of 'back pack'
---
The best kind.
---
it does not unlock the previous tiers. I have shielded raider but not protective raider. and I have no idea where I got the shielded raider plans from. but I have it for a long time. I had it at least since before the first fasnacht.
---
The. Fucking. Fast. Travel. Bug. Goddamnit.
---
Hey Mags,  if you want to pay your respects to your dad, come one over to my place.  I made a great rug out of him.
---
I've played 3,NV and completed 4 but never got in to builds, I sort of just use what gun i feel is most useful combining fire rate and dps, so maybe on this one thats where I'm going wrong.
---
Hmm i havent played in more than a year and only started playing yesterday, i only have 100ish scrips with like 3 unwanted 3 star legendary weapons, should i wait till the sale or fuck it and try my luck today ?
---
I have a question...Is there such a thing as a legacy gatling laser?
---
I'd like to be able to sell them.
---
Calibrated Shocks.
---
I need an adult!  I need an adult!  Stranger Danger!
---
I think end of September is when it starts.
---
I'm assuming you mean build, which I dont really have a set build, never need on 4 when I completed and not played much of 3 or NV.
---
I don't think you could pay me enough to play NW on PC. All I ever hear about is rampant cheating on PC, but I haven't really seen any on console that I have noticed, at least.
---
BONK
---
had this last night. I am the only PA with heavy gun. NOBODY has the common sensse to say hey, let me get the minions off this guy so he can keep unloading the minigun. Not even taking ads to them got them helping.
---
instead they kept trying to melee Earle.  Was a colossal fail.
---
I know 😐
---
I mean weight reduction.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
That the dice you roll bro
---
You choice to play a multiplayer game that way and unfortunately for you Bethesda Priority in a multiplayer game are make the multiplayer experience better
---
So do we get atoms for dailies during the “break” or just s.o.l. ?
---
Also on the east coast in US, but hiiiiii!
---
Man, Suited Up was nice :/
---
They said they want a break between seasons, so Update 22 will most likely come in the second half of the month.
---
The reputation grind though.... ugh.
---
I bet it’s just a bug
---
Start a new character. That’s what i did when I got a bunch of good rifles such as BE lever and handmade from murmrgh and loots. It’s a pain in the ass to move perk points back and forth so I built a 2nd character for rifles. Way less hassle and struggle than changing one character constantly.
---
Then it'll take up a chest slot. Meaning no Jetpack or Emergency Protocols. No hot swapping either. You must exit armor, press the Transfer button, and swap chest mods that way. We lose our backpack stepping into power armor. Power armor needs to lose something with a backpack as well.
---
Of course, I wouldn't want to be one shot killing everything when level 31. I have the female ally at my camp (can't remember her name but she's always playing a guitar) and got the ally mission find beckett. I was already at lewisburg so though I go and do it, boy was that a mistake. Manged it in the end but I seem to keep coming across monster at like level 69, so it makes me think maybe I'm still a little bit to low level.
---
Or just let packing light apply to rifles aswell
---
If I were you, I would make sure I'm turning in enough stuff to get 150 scrip per day and save up to be at max scrip for the sale. If you're maxing out every day, you'll be able to buy six 3* weapons in between now and then to maximize your scrip.
---
Wait you can server hop and give blackeye more meat?
---
Don't know tonne honest, don't think we get anything.
---
They seriously better change the perk card swaping for coins BS.
---
No. But if you never want to worry about rads again outside of nuke zones or radiation rumble, max out What Rads? and throw away all of your radiation chems or perks. I did and I couldn't be happier.
---
You can equip jetpack and backpack with ss armor
---
Because it would essentially relieve 9 perk cards. While all thenothers relieve 3 at most. Bteaking it down puts it on the same level as the others already in game.
---
Yeah, probably best to just get one ally for the dailies then wait till you are higher level. I found I had my build set up by around level 100on my first play through
---
Yea. I did the same.  Played fo3, NV, fo4 and not once did I ever know builds were a thing till I started playing 76.
---
We're here.
---
Ash heap is appropriate for the 30’s.
---
if you are not comfortable there yet, you can always continue to roam the forest and toxic valley for a few more levels.
---
Where do you get the camouflage paint for the helmet??
---
Can we please remove floater grenades?
---
They need to load the world to know if your camp fits there. So basically you would have much longer load in times because you chose a popular camp spot. 
---
Sometimes you just want to get in the game without waiting forever for a world. You also get to move for free if you so choose.
---
Bethesda really does need to fix the combat related bugs first more than any other glitches.  Those are really the most game breaking, immersion breaking, enjoyment crushing things of the game.  And it seems they've been around from the start.  But unless everyone votes with their wallet, nothing really will encourage Todd to fix things.
---
it doesn't know if there is a camp where yours is until it finds a world.
---
yeah that nice and all.....till the handholding becomes annoying and cloying. i need copper,mod this, mod that for me, i need .... i need.......
---
There is zero indication it will start Tuesday lol
---
Did we win the wood challenge? I think it was something like 5 million left on the last day.
---
And? Either than the default, backpack mods come with resistance penalties. Power armor already has enormous resistance bonuses. There has to be a negative.
---
Im shy so i dont talk on mic but i just have push to talk off and voice chat volume on 0. I have no idea if people actually know i cant hear them and i hope i havent ignored anyone by mistake. As for chatting, in my camp i set up a letters spelling out 'hi are you new hit g' for new players because you can sometimes tell if theyre new players or just a new character by if they arent using the emotes.
---
invite them to your camp and build a flamethrower trap on them and steal all their loot.
---
I feel like I've been littering the Wasteland with 1% cores that I just dump (and can't even recycle).
---
Oh thanks lol, I actually dont want it to heal rads, im bloodied lol
---
Common sense and experience you gain from trading with people.
---
25ore and 1 survival is all that needed to pass the event
---
Yer I keep seeing things about build but never bother on fo4 which I completed, so haven't really bothered on this one maybe I'm going to have to. Would you say to explore savage divide before ash heap or for now just stick to toxic Valley and the forest as I have decent guns and armour but is all starts at level 40.
---
Hiiiiiii! How's it going?
---
Yup. Its a terrible design for the legendary perk system and really a smack in the face for anyone whos played this game a long time.   
---
I'm in the same boat as you and I am extremely pissed off about this turning in perk card bs.
---
Best gun would be the gun designed for ur loadout.
---
The Raider reputation glitch is still working... Just saying.
---
Probably a high level player was there just before you. Ash Heap is around lvl 25-40 zone, with average gear you can manage it.
---
That works too.  :)
---
So sounds like the event just glitched or waited too long to deposit the ore.
---
The point where it says world found is when the CAMP location should be checked, not after loading in all of the assets.
---
That should all be happening server side before the client game loads.
---
Guess we are all going to miss you. 😉
---
the least they could've done was add in a "sell all of this ammo type" button.
---
Wait wait wait so you’re telling me that the first time I did that quest, my friends and I went into a weird abandoned mine, murdered some chick’s dad who happened to be a man eating monster, stole his head(s), and now his undead head(s) are just sitting by my vendors twitching and his skin is doing the same thing in my bungalow and no one has said a thing?
---
You prefer junk over script?
---
They have said that system is over.
---
Alright, I'll add you. My GT is same as here.
---
So 30's so be able to deal with the level 69 infected ghouls that look like they have been on steroids since the bombs dropped, cause they ran through me in secs the other day.
---
I think it's like 95-99% reduction IIRC. Stealth Suit and PA are pretty much the only viable gear in nuke zones sadly.
---
I really wish I could wear outfits over top the stealth suit.
---
It sound like it glitch I have waited seconds before trading in ores and still successful
---
Nothing like accidentally throwing a nade and throwing all the shit (plans) all over the fucking room.
---
Aaaaand now I know the strategy next time I go in! Thanks! I’m still trying to figure out the best way to fight him. I think I’m good in terms of armor (full unyielding including secret service chest piece but am trying for a better unyielding roll for that) but I’m just really struggling to find out which weapon will do more damage than what I’m doing. I think my plasma Gatling is fine but I’m just not satisfied
---
So I take it builds are a lot more important on this one and something worth looking into.
---
Now all we need is an end-game boss event that spawns mobs with adhesive in the same numbers and my world will be perfect.
---
Been grinding for unyielding on my left leg for that long, I come to a point where I have too much armour for each days worth of scrip😂
---
Are you on PC? I'd be happy to run it with you a few times.
---
Thanks for this, I've been wondering about this, here's an upvote 😜✌️
---
No stick to the west of the map, savage device has packs of feral ghouls at level 62 and they will kill you very quickly. Can't post link because I am on my phone but type nukes and dragons in to google. Its a great build tool. Play around with it. If you are struggling for damage I would suggest going for a junkies vats rifle build.
---
I think my response then would have read “it just works!” 😂
---
If they can't be sold or traded to other players, I think the current system of turning them in at the legendary exchange is better than scrapping them for steel.
---
Are there any details on the exploding palm perk, specifically how much damage it deals? Is it affected by demo expert?
---
Yup. More proof they don't play or test their own game. Ever. Monumentally stupid putting that effect on a single shot weapon.
---
Yeah, I learned about that way too late which is honestly infuriating because at the time I was spending all my scrip in modules to get rad resist SS gear. Now I run bloodied anyway, but I feel for the people who have yet to find all of these stupid and obscure design "features" the hard way.
---
Someone obviously needs to teach the little shit some life lessons.  Better in a game than real life.
---
Thats what I though otherwise why would you start getting mission there.
---
Yeah, that happens occasionally.
---
Yes but I’m talking about it like a cosmetic option for our camps that would be in the atomic shop
---
Definitely more useful in 76 because of the level cap, in the other games you get that powerful it never really mattered what you picked.
---
I say, if you don’t have a decent weapon now, go for the 2* weapons as the RNG for effects will be better.  
---
If you already have a decent weapon then go for 3*.
---
It's a bethesda game. What did you expect?
---
PSN: kyrawyra :)
---
So do you only scrip Untradable armour? - what about bog standard 3* items that are dropped by SBQ &amp; ACP?
---
Thats another thing I might be doing wrong as I find i use vats a lot less on this than on the other games.
---
so one thing ive seen in your comments is that you say you never needed a build in prior fallouts and you seem to not be interested in using a build
---
this game isnt fallout new vegas or fallout 4 though
---
id say you dont need to do a maxed out build but one thing you should definitely do is to pick one weapon type you want to use as your main weapon, and get the according damage perk cards (rifleman/shotgunner/heavy gunner ...)
---
if you continue to just use whatever weapon you get your hands on without investing in your damage output, youll constantly run out of ammo
---
this still doesnt mean that you have to think through every perk you choose or that you have to set for a certain build like junkies or bloodied but imo as i said at least some damage perks should be considered
---
for max resist use radsheild instead of diluted rad-x , this will stack with a glowing blood pack.
---
Move your CAMP somewhere less popular.
---
Exactly.
---
This is solely a pc problem.
---
That's something a chem addict would say.
---
Didn't think this would be such a *hot* take. Pellegrino and Ellis are both great television devils. It's not like you said you wanted to see the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's version of Lucifer or something...
---
I prioritize scripping non-tradable gear. Everything else I list in my vendors. Once I run out of non-tradable gear to scrip, then I start scripping the regular stuff if I need scrip.
---
if it was shared across the account it would be better , but per character it's pretty insane if you play more then one build
---
Makes a world of difference, make sure you get at least 1 point in the concentrated fire perk and you will be able to just do head shots.
---
Nah. Wasted perk points. The reduction in weight should be paired with something already applying to rifles. Tank killer makes the most sense.
---
The legendary perks for example. The first version on the PTR for update 20 was horribly ballanced and most perks where trash. Know the ptr gives me hope. And it's a bethesda game after all.
---
I still use it, especially in the Uranium Fever Event.  I get my one hit in and then I do the emote.  I appreciate it when others do the same.  Regardless of the mouth breathers that kill it on sight, doesn't mean I have be like them.
---
4 also has the same style walls we see many of the shacks and ramschackle places use. Would love to have access to that to properly fit in. Junk fenced were a step on the right direction.
---
Ghoul slayer gamma gun for sure!
---
Wadu?
---
This series is great! Keep up the good work!
---
Yes.  Especially if u want to kill stuff efficient.
---
I havent played in a while, back then the best way to farm legendaries was to nuke whitespring and bullethose the fat bastards. What's the best method to farm them nowadays?
---
I have never seen charred ghouls in the ash heap
---
I just like the evil dick Mark plays more than some beautiful angelic lucifer.
---
I am still pretty new, what exactly is the process of "blueprinting" in a camp?
---
From how you describe it, I still need to have the plan(s) for the things I am blueprinting in order to make them in my own camp? How is it different from just building it myself normally in my own camp?
---
Thank you for your assistance!
---
I do take damage perks, I think I was a bit broad I  what I said, I tend to stay away from things like RPGs and fat man's. I tend to have a rifle, a pistol and a shotgun and carry a energy weapon just in case. I have perks (can't remember the names without being on the game) that make my rifles or pistols do more damage. Maybe I need to concentrate on just one of these instead of 3.
---
The wr reduction backpacks from foundation and crator  doesn't have any penalties for the user that equips it , I don't see why power armor should for similar backpacks . You can equip jetpack and backpack at the same time and power armor shouldn't? Power armor may have a bonus of 42% but not 3*** Legendary effects 
---
The only backpack that has a penalties is high capacity which is -60 for er and -60 rr. If there was a power armor equivalent to this,  then -60 er and -60 re can be given power armor.
---
Oh god love my heavy weapons but its just embarrassing staring at a wendigo because he pimp slapped out of my minigun wind up
---
Ok thank you.
---
You’ll find plenty of people willing to admit there’s no endgame, and that it’s still a big problem. But what remains of the player base also seems willing to sit and wait for one. 
---
I’d be more comfortable with the level of charity in game if more people were like OP, and admitted that it’s born out of boredom at least as much as altruism. It suits Bethesda to whitewash this fact (‘we had no idea you’d all be so nice!’) when it’s largely due to failures in their game, but that’s a disingenuity the player base should never buy into.
---
Yep I owed one once, can even get 2 legacies effects on it, it was double explosive
---
its all RNG.
---
Tag before emote.
---
Is there a trick to getting it to aim at the head as I have a ranked 1 of that perk attached.
---
Oooh, thats a monster
---
You mean one that you can just pick up and not use the RNG vending machine? I haven't been over to Westtek too much really, so not familiar with the place.
---
You get chance for a legendary when you complete events and dailies. It doesn't have have anything to do with your particular performance during it, it's just a random chance.
---
Raiders may be evil, but settlers aren’t good. 
---
The only true good in 76 died in the glass caverns. Brotherhood!
---
He's good at that. He was awesome as Bishop in Being Human too.
---
Well, you can't scrap legendary pieces anyway.
---
Exactly, literally just hop onto the roof and there’s a chair with a plate beside it, and on the plate is a perfectly preserved pie
---
Oooooo man that sounds awesome. I would love to try one of those out. I might have to check eBay to do that though 😂😭 Thanks for the info!
---
I'm nearly there, on 98.
---
Yeah! For some reason I always get this plan lol. My gamer tag is ash lemonjello. I won’t be on till 6pm eastern
---
Yer I had two level 69's come of of nowhere at me.
---
I tend to scrip untradeable items, or things no one will want.  Stalker's bowie knife, I'm looking at you!  Good items that don't fit my style go to my mule to hold for big trades.  Meh items go in my vending machines.
---
The rigmarole of doing the laser grid and fixing the pipes and the mainframe...once you do it once, you should be allowed to bypass all that at least ONCE per 24 hours.
---
its a fair question? realy? no its NOT. Because no build, no weapon of choice, nothing \*facepalm\* its a question without anything to answer it. thats why its not a fair question because we could tell him anything that doesnt help him because we dont know what he plan to do with his char/build/what so ever.
---
Yup! Fix those type of bugs and add more end game content. Quit trying to change how the leveling/legendaries/perks work over and over.
---
That sounds really frustrating. I'd get stuck on an infinite loading screen glitch and not realize it's glitched.
---
high PER helps most rifles
---
Every backpack mod besiddes faction mods has penalties. What you said is verifiably false. What you want is enormous resistances on top of enormous damage reduction on top of fully flux modded extra 100 carry weight on top of massive radiation resistance and so on and so on. You just want all buffs with zero trade off or negatives. No. That's absurd.
---
you forgot to add that on launch, all the perks will also not be working
---
because bethesda
---
So you want it to load a world in the background, just to check if your camp can be placed, before it loads the world and places your camp?
---
So two load times? 
---
What about if you have a popular spot, and you get caught in a loop of "checking... nope... checking... nope... checking... nope... checking..."? 
---
What if you actually want to take the opportunity to move camp for free?
---
My endgame is keeping bloodieds alive with a fine mixture of solar vanguards, team medic, and empath.  I've never felt more useful.
---
Ghouls can’t be lvl 69
---
That would be great, but....it would make the load in times even longer for everyone, wouldn't it?
---
Faster fire rate
---
Highly doubtful. There are supposed to be four seasons each year, ten-weeks each. That leaves 12 weeks, so it’s logical that they would plan to have three weeks between seasons. 
---
I predict **September 29th** is when the next season will begin.
---
well all three seems a bit much investement
---
i do think two weapon classes can be viable, in your case rifles and pistols should go well together, as you probably use sneak wich you need a lot of agility for anyways
---
the problem i see is that you will suffer on dps in the late game, both rifles and pistols work well against most enemies but fall short when facing the bigger threats, but unless you want to solo the scorched beast queen or hunt down sheepsquatches you should be fine.
---
my advice would be that you focus on two weapon classes instead of three,
---
other than that it seems like your only problem atm is the way fallout 76 handles spawns
---
if a high level player enters an area, the enemies are leveled according to him and you probably encounter those enemies
---
other than private servers there isnt a work around sadly
---
but dont worry it gets better and around level 40 your damage output should be high enough that you can quite easily take down most enemies 👍🏼
---
2) why not both? I like the idea of level up being a repeatable over the week. Suits the challenge far better.
---
If you take over a workshop that has items built by another player, you can blueprint those too. That's how I got extractors.
---
FFR
---
Oh, cripes! Thanks.
---
Would be nice if it just picked up right after S1 ended. Oh well. I'll just go back to Fallout 4 inbetween. lol
---
I enjoy all the food/water aspects of the game. It probably wouldn't break anything for me if that went away, but I feel like there's plenty of other things that need tinkering instead.
---
Hmm i tried. My gauss rifle does 2600dmg when i 'vats' headshot a supermutant there.
---
In vats move the left thumb stick left or right to select which limb. Then try not to move it between kills. Takes a while to get use to but it does work well.
---
Thank you for confirming this 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fqxtfk/unarmed_drops_from_mobs_only_dropping_with_limb/
---
Crafting the gauntlet does not seem to be restricted to the limb damage restriction, I crafted a BSS gauntlet about a month after waste landers was released
---
And where exactly is that found in Appalachia?
---
All such great characters.
---
And no the power armor negatives would have to higher than 60 each. Closer to 150. And if there was a backpack for it, it would need to be applied to an unmodded power armor set. Again, you just want buffs on buffs on enormous buffs with zero trade off or negatives. Wow.
---
Awesome!! I'll be on at that time as well. I'll hit you up after work if you don't mind 😁 thanks!! My GT is: vie carry us
---
Maybe we should start a "MISC elimination" movement and clean up this mess. Thanks.
---
I'm done having to spell this out for you in crayon. You're too stupid to understand balance.
---
Then might not been ghouls. They about the same height as a ghoul but built like the grafton monster and the two I came across where black. I dont know if that helps  I didn't get chance to see their names I was dead within secs.
---
Energy backpack could be called Battery Pack.
---
All it is doing is finding a world with a space. I'm no computer game designer person but i imagine it's not easy to program it to find out where your camp is and then check to see if it's available. Especially when they have actual problems to fix and new content to add.
---
considering it’s pretty much widely perceived as hot garbage, it comes around fairly often on sale. i believe the last one was about a month or two ago so maybe give it another 2-3 to circulate back around
---
Xbox.
---
You can get it at Gamestop pre-owned for 10 if that kind of thing doesn't bother you.
---
I was hoping for pension but all i got was Tension.
---
Chem/food mod for backpack doesn't have any penalties and these 2 are much more worth to use than other ones, like heavy capacity mod which gives you -60 DR/ER penalty.
---
Funny that you talk about negatives when non-PA jetpack doesn't even need fuel to be used. Where is drawback for this?
---
No,  I just wasnt aware of the penalties for the other mods for backpack until l went to the wiki. You are right , penalties should be induced. But not higher, just the same. And control your temper
---
I don't sneak, I much more guns blazing type and just cover, move, cover, move. If that the case might just wait till one wasteland and it should get rid of that problem.
---
It's like $10 for a physical copy. I think Walmart everyday price is $17.99
---
A tse combat rifle got me through level 50 to 150 easy.untill I made the bloodied change.tse is solid for full health still.i think so
---
Dont agree. Tank killer already has 2 effects on it, a 3rd would be too much. 
---
Rifles have zero downsides besides weight and with the exception of legacies and magic weapons are the best weapons on the game. Giving up 3 perk slots to negate their only downside is not unreasonable.
---
Happens to me often just like you described.
---
Sadly I don’t think most people know of Aries since he shows up as a guard after doing Riding Shotgun three times in the same server...
---
(For some reason the event doesn’t show up every 40 minutes for me anymore, I’ll be lucky if it even shows up at all. Shame too cause I liked running caravan jobs every 40 minutes.)
---
Yup.  Known.  
---
BTW, is anyone actually using any of the three cursed weapons?  I've got a collection of them in vending waiting their turn to be script.
---
I tend to just keep moving when using it that will be the problem, thanks for the help.
---
Thanks for the info. The rug was the first plan I got and I never even thought about trying it.
---
While we’re here, why is the design of the game so different from other Fallout games? Other fallout games, menus have that “terminal” feel while this one is very modern-ish, with lots of San Sarifs and such. Always wondered that, as a graphic designer that deals a lot with branding.
---
It may not be something you remotely know but I’ve always been curious.
---
Does this mean that at level 500-whatever, you can tame Earle and bring him back to scare the crap out of anyone who visits your CAMP?
---
Good to know! Thanks.
---
I've dropped my final word because of these goddamn floater grenades

---

---
Oooo Stator pack! Stators are what charge your batteries on vehicles, and it sounds cool
---
Damn!
---
What if you have unused perk points do you need to use them or lose them?
---
I see your comments, they are working on it. I don't have an update right now.
---
I never payed much attention to that in past games either but it is massively more important in f76.
---
Also as in past games, the further you get away from the vault, the harder it gets. The upcoming one wasteland update should make your life a bit easier.
---
If you hit an area which is too hard, go do something else until you feel powerful enough to return.
---
One more thing, guess who has to remove all of these bonuses (jetpack, backpack, secret service armor) in nuke zones, moron? Non power armor users. Fuck outta here with your nonsense.
---
Well...good news is that your dad’s not dead.  Bad news is that he’s not quite what you’d call alive, either.
---
This is a valuable discovery. It'd nice if we could bundle together a package for a simple drop. We could premake little gift bags to simplify the sharing.
---
I hope someday there will be a mod....

It’s easy to keep them alive with the healing shish sword. Them attacking helps. At least for me.

When I had my satanic church camp I sold everything for 666 caps.  At my current camp I just have a preserved pie for 7676 caps.

It's fun to run and get out under the timer.
---
OR
---
Just stick around shooting any final Wendys and loot them all for screws.  Tons of screws!  When the get out timer completed you will be ported outside automatically and receive the completion rewards.
---
Be on a team that all does the event.  You get to loot their kills as well as your own.
---
I leave the event with 200-300 screws each time.
---
I have the infamous b ex +p gatling plasma and it just sits in my stash along with a quad ex cryolater. Getting blown up sucks
---
I hope not for the benefit of bloodied builds.
---
Almost two years they've been "working on it". At some point just rip the band-aid off and admit they're too incompetent to actually fix it. Lip service is beyond getting old.
---
Not bad.  Wait for the nocturnal walking cane.  It is best.

Thanks for the post, I'll raise this!

There’s a fun bug with the trail fireworks that if you equip them in your quick wheel while holding any gun, that gun gets a rapid reload. If you select another gun, you have to select another grenade, and quick select the fireworks again.
---
It was kind of a joke
---
The og unstoppable monster
---
I get my character in confi clothing before putting her to bed, only in my camp of course.
---
I think that is what is so great about the game as it is now - regional differences in level - it made some parts scarier and created weird anticipation about the unknown.  I hope One Wasteland doesn't ruin that.
---
Pretty awesome that a rifle build can now have half-decent heavy gunner perks for big boss battles.  And that ammo perk........sweeeeeet!
---
Ah this is why I haven't seen him in ages.  When I first started the event he was there all the time.  Though I like all of them to be honest.
---
Let's get a mooooove on XD
---
Good point. What other rifle perks are there besides damage? I can't remember any off the top of my head. Grounder pounder wouldn't work because that's just automatics. Let's brainstorm. Because a .50 cal weighing as little as it does with bear arms compared to a decked out Handmade is ludicrous lol.
---
I'm sorry I didn't mention my CD thing is broken for the ps4 so I have to get it digital
---
I was sure dataminers confirmed it was 180/60. And things like PA, Bobbleheads, Magazines, Clothing etc only have a *chance* to spawn. Have you been counting them when testing?
---
Play the game for an hour and you’ll be complaining having maxed script for next week. That being said, all public events especially radiation rumble and project paradise, followed by uranium event. Run west tek and burrows for high chance of 3star.
---
Fixer plan 90 caps

Weirder is if there is a pillow on the bed it gets moved out of the way when you lay down.  “What is this thing? Who keeps putting junk on my bed?”   *Tosses pillow aside*

I love freezing the queen
---
My bad for not mentioning my CD drive thing is broken bro I can't play physical disc's
---
It’s a good idea. I often feel games need to go back and refresh older content. Adding seasonal cosmetic rewards would be a good method.
---
You only have to KILL the Yao Guai with a syringer. You can drop his HP with anything you like before doing that. Then deal the final blows with your syringer.
---
Thanks, for the correction. I meant the nuka-cola "cooler". The absurdly large cooler that hold the same amount of items as the tiny "ice box"

Use the LFG on Xbox. It’s on the same menu as party invites. Click looking for game, select Fallout 76, then keep refreshing the list until you see someone saying they’re doing colossus wendigo. Click on their name and join game. You might have to wait a few minutes if their world is full at first (why it’s important to refresh the posts and try to snag a fresh posting). 
---
You’ll always find competent players for colossal problem and queen beast that way. It’s the one advantage Xbox has over other systems, the LFG is great.
---
Well it's in the title...
---
 
---
You want a 10% damage per second buff or a 25% damage per second buff !?
---
😉
---
This is the real solution. 
---
That pylon that everyone likes to build inside of above the monorail elevator, well I had a camp in the grove of trees right next to it for months, and I only had 1 instance where I couldn't load my camp there even when someone had their camp in the pylon. And that wasn't because someone built in the pylon, someone built between the pylon and where my camp was. If two people were trying to put camps down together, that's a great spot for it.
---
Thanks, folks. That answers my question.
---
I think the Harpoon Gun with the flachettes mod is a magic weapon, I can 1 shot 68 super mutants with it in vats on a torso shot with no heavy weapon perks. Using the trail fireworks fast reload trick helps with the 1 shot syndrome, and you get more harpoons if you loot corpses. I started with 7 and am up to 90. If magic weapons get fixed into the scrip machine it goes.
---
Gotcha, i assume this means legendaries are easier to get now? Thanks so much for the info
---
For clarity, legendary specials max at 15, in addition to the standard max of 15? Being a total of 30?
---
Only one way out, BUT, there is a room to the right of the exit that blows open at the end and has a ton of loot in it. You’ll see it behind a locked door when you first spawn into the event.
---
Damned Enclave thinking they are superior.
---
For those who experience frequent CAMP location conflicts, this would save a lot of time and effort, and for anyone else, there should be no noticeable change since it would find a world and load into it normally on the first try. This suggestion is only to change the order of processes.
---
Load times should only be affected in cases where CAMP location conflicts are occurring, and in those cases, total load time to get in game would be much shorter as far as I can tell, since much of the load delay each time is due to the time required to load local assets from your storage device, which seems to be dumped and reloaded every time you have to retry. 
---
The load screens could also give helpful messages, such as "world found", "CAMP could not be placed, retrying".
---
It could also be a menu option such as "Auto-retry CAMP placement when joining game"
---
goooood stuff!
---
In general, you should be finding  theses (or lower): L14 mole miners, L22 ghouls, a L30 sentrybot, L20 something gutsy/protectron, L32 sorched, L22 ghouls.  An occasional scorchbeast, L30 supermutants, and for a certain mission, a L42 Assaultron.  There is one wendigo.
---
I dont remember the levels for mole rats, raiders, and eagles, and the Crypted event goes higher.  I did stumble across a sleeping legendary SSQ a few days ago.
---
If you are in the company of a high level, they may go higher, or if the area has been nuked, they will be higher
---
I had caps to burn so I was vendor hopping, buying up every 3* legendary I saw for up to 800 caps and up to 350 for any 2* to turn in for scrip. When doing this, I don't really pay much attention to anything other than how many stars and how many caps. After buying up 30 weapons or so, I go back to my camp and actually look through my haul and see that I got a 2* junkies combat shotgun with explosive rounds. Did a price check post and got several replies that it's worth 15-25k. Not bad for a few hundred caps.
---
You get a free full set of Ultracite power armour for completing the Brotherhood questline

This system sounds terrible to rank up one card
---
Actually its Nate dog
---
I never play multiplayer games on PC because of all the rampant cheating.
---
Personal opinion, it only bothers me how fast the meters seem to drain and how much food and water it takes to fill the bars back up. As others have said, I shouldn't need to eat 3 steaks per meal and drink 3 pitchers of tea to stay full. And I'm not burning that many calories to need to eat that much every freakin' hour.
---
I think if they toned it down it would be far less annoying, but they need an excuse to have so many recipes in the game...gotta make the players harvest, right?
---
But also, as others have said, I don't think it should entirely be removed. It kinda adds to the immersion a bit, to be "softcore survival" and make me think about hunger and thirst. I just don't want hunger and thirst to control my play style (like it does in real life).
---
I had the same problem . Go in power armor then drop all your fusion cores then after you drop them pick them all back up . It should work
---
I think if you've put 15 points into STR, and take the full ranks, you'd have 20 STR but you can never have more than 15 points worth of cards.
---
Nah. Think about balance. T-65 (barring the enormous gold price) has ridiculous resistance. Calibrated Shocks adds a lot of carry weight. We lose all of these badass bonuses the moment we step foot in a nuke zone. Power armor doesn't. Decent trade off would be a hefty but not gigantic loss of resistance to damage, but an enormous loss of radiation resistance. And obviously the loss of a chest mod. I'd be curious what it would look like with one. Maybe pockets all over? Bigass goofy fanny pack? Giant doofy actual backpack?
---
24 mins left on the event.
---
Got a 3* junkies lever action for 600 caps yesterday. Probably my favourite though was an instigating explosive limb damage combat shotgun for a few hundred. Between that and the Gauss shotgun my shottie character is set.
---
I like the shovel because of the weight and use it for digging daily quests.
---
The pickaxe is a great starter bloody melee build weapon for people that haven’t found their god roll bloody build weapons yet.
---
Give ya 1600 for it right now, no questions asked!!! Lucky...

It was like this in 4 as well. It barely did more damage than a equivalent Gun Nut modded Combat Rifle with a much much worse fire rate and rarer ammo type. Not helping you could just put long barrel mods and a scope on the CR and have a much better practical sniper rifle than the dedicated sniper itself. Even the final upgrades had it fall short.
---
That’s what you got from looting Earle’s body, what he’s talking about is the guaranteed 3* drop after you escape the mine or die once the mine collapses at the end.
---
I do this to my cousin all that time with a suppressed handmade.  When he walks past  a car I will blow it up and it scares the hell out of him every time.
---
The armor perks were awful, as you can't target or upgrade legendary items from light/sturdy/heavy.  It's almost like the people creating this shit don't even play the game.
---
Captain obvious in the building
---
Anyways its easier to swap one card versus 3
---
Fixer plan: 600 caps. BSS+S Super Sledge: 1200 caps (max lvl)
---
It's going to be a legendary perk
---
Not really, I once received a pencil for 250 wood. A fucking pencil. How can I use that?
---
I'd prefer not to overpromise &amp; underdeliver...unfortunately, we've been getting both for the last few updates.
---
The best updates that I can remember were "Wild Appalachia." Whatever they were doing at the time, they did it right - because we didn't have near the number of issues we have now.
---
For example, Patch 21 will go down in this game's history as perhaps the worst - and not just because of the bugs, but because of the blatantly false patch notes.
---
I use regular low cores to make ultracite cores. 2 makes 3 with perk cards.
---
I do like the idea, but I like to swap my picking and hacking perk cards out when I'm out and then when I come across a level 1 lock I would only have to assign 1 card e.g. only switch out a 1 star card like green thumb or scrapper respectively.. I see where you are coming from.. but I also see the usefulness of the current system
---
This doesn’t stop the problem so you might have to do it again another time
---
Get a lever action and some sneak perks, not sure when sneak unlocks though.  I would get a ski sword also, don’t need perks for it to work well(saves ammo).
---
I'm a bloodied commando, and I'm routinely headshotting enemies for 1200+ damage. So if that's something that would be worth it to you, then try it. Captainoob made a YT guide for stealth commandos, and that's the build I'm using.
---
The menu-option would be a good idea, given the fact that there are so many resource nodes in the world, Bethesda should've planned ahead for those kind of placement conflicts and given an option like that. 
---
Frankly, there's a lot of menu options they should've given us - like silence all the audio from protectrons, for instance. But, that's another issue.
---
Yeah I've had this problem a few times now it's very annoying
---
No I have same settings and I have blackscreen in Fullscreen
---
Theres tormentor in luck , the sniper perk for stability, one for range aswell iirc
---
QERW Ultracite laser rifle for 3000, QE +Reload double barrel for 1000
---
"We will assume your issue has been resolved if we do not hear from you within 96 hours (4 days)."
---
Finally someone one with the guts.........🧨💥💥💥
---
i can imagine that the brotherhood will provide us such a mod...
---
The point is that it is already doing a check on the x,y,z coordinates of CAMP location, I just feel that it is being done after the game loads fully, which is not ideal.
---
You may recall that it didn't used to give us the option to try to rejoin another world, and this was added on. It is my opinion that this was done hastily, and could be refined by changing the order that these things are executed.
---
I'm not suggesting that such a change be done at the exclusion of content or critical bug fixes, although I do consider this a design flaw.
---
IIRC content creation and bug fixing are two different teams, but I'm not a developer so ignore me i guess
---
Does anyone actually use them?
---
Moving my camp unnecessarily because I saw someone else's camp that had a cool concept and location which gave me inspiration to rebuild therefore depleting my scrap down to bare minimums and now I cant craft or cook anything so I have to go back out and scrounge around for junk to build my stash back up only to find another camp that gives me a new idea and so on and so on... (run on sentence intended)
---
I have a 3 star explosive bloodied short flamer.
---
I keep forgetting tormentor exists. Never used it. Is it any good?
---
I love sorting by weight and having 50 cal and gatling guns weigh less than handmades and assault rifles. It really makes you wonder. Is this 10 pound assault rifle really worth keeping in comparison to the .18 pound 50 cal?
---
Congrats on getting all the rare drops!
---
So I finally got around to checking the FPS around my camp (got sidetracked by Wasteland 3) and apart from a drop to ~45 whenever I initially load into an area, it stays steady at 60 everywhere including the Whitespings Greens. But I've also got a less than 1 year old PC running a 2080 Ti.
---
You guys are getting responses from Beth?
---
You play long enough, you end up getting them all. But variety is the spice of life.
---
I sold one of those before I knew it was rare.
---
Do higher one star cards give more coins like lone wanderer? It has one star but requires 2points in charisma to use. Do cards like that give more perk coins?
---
Same.  So many cool outfits that I can't use because I run around 99.9% of the time in stealth armour.
---
Both scout masks for 10caps a piece. 😝
---
Yeah there is a lot of problems with vats in 76, but on the whole I think Bethesda have done a great job.
---
beers´n bombs! aka every lootable beer and type of grenade so far. it fits the BOS i´d say...
---
Just let us drop them or sell them tbh. They are common as hell anyway.
---
I’d like to see the return of the r91 assault rifle
---
Huh I don't remember completing it but Maybe I did idk
---
As a lvl 18 you have no real reason to ft, because you need the junk you get when going by foot.
---
If you haven't picked one up yet, grab a Mole Miners Gauntlet, that's about the strongest weapon for damage you can reliably start getting past lvl 20. If you collect the molerat teeth and have the perks to mod it for the extra blade, you'll be able to take down enemies that are a little higher level than you with ease. Plus, it's just fun to use!
---
If you don't have the perks, and you're on XB1, I'll mod one for you.
---
Glad to hear Bethesda has completely ignored the issue of glitched cards being deleted and massively screwing over anybody who has unknowingly sacrificed cards to try different builds 👍
---
And it's going to cost even *more* of this currency to just swap the cards?  What an effing joke...
---
Yeah! I discovered this just the other day. I took the dirt track, and someone had left a nice little wooden shack with some work benches, storage, and turrets on each corner of the roof. I walked over and tried to blueprint it, and tada, it worked. I've been using that little shack ever since, lol. Great feature.
---
FISTO collectron when?
---
Ask us again once "one wasteland" has been out for a few weeks.
---
There is just too much "balancing" going on atm.
---
I think it’s going to put more unexpected pressure on vendors. Higher level enemies means much better loot, which means hitting the 1,400 cap limit a lot faster.
---
There are no rads to deal with in the mine. It's not until the event is over that you either escape or are forced out of the mine to the surface where the rads have any effect. Just have a hazmat suit in your inventory to hop into after the event completes, and then casually walk yourself out of the rads.
---
Ive killed the SBQ solo many times on a private server, the challenge still will not complete for me.
---
that charisma perk card NOT letting you share perks would mean i would have no use slotting it, i hope this is not the case as i did want to use it.
---
Q FFR FR handmade for 1,4K or something low like that.
---
Unfortunately that is not correct. I heard the same thing, so I tried nuking by just grazing the mine and it did not start the event. You must include the mine in the nuke zone to start ACP, the whole icon not just grazing it.
---
I did not know this re: INT feeding XP, thank you
---
Yes the penalties would have to be higher. It's called balance. You cannot say that removing only 60 ballistic energy and radiation resistance on power armor is in any way comparable to losing 60 for regular armor, that's genuinely stupid. Again, I'm having to spoon feed you.
---
Please elaborate
---
I would say "smoke jet every day" but it doesn't yet exist in the timeline
---
Bethesda... Make it happen!
---
I always imagine it's the game helping me out when I don't get to loot the SBQ or Earle or other legendary kills.
---
Nope. It was nearly all books from that house plus the junk behind the sons of dane compound.  100% positive it isn't 180 anymore if it was. Even when i've messed up i got to 180-190 and stuff didn't respawn.  
---
Never seen (or went looking) for any official posts on it.
---
Had a similar levels with 3 people and had about 7 minutes left. Only i was the heavy and the other two were commando stealth builds. 
---
Not sure why people complain about not being able to finish
---
It's ffr try it.
---
My luck is awful all I ever find is mounted plans and combat rifles XD
---
We have a date with destiny, and it looks like she ordered the lobster.
---
Ok I have both and use them both alot, so lets start with the flamer, Pros: Very good DPS, even when not bloodied, Benefit from heavy gunner perks, fairly accurate, Very good range, Cons: Atrocious durability, flamer fuel can be a hassle to get and it burns though it, repairing can be a pain, you need to be swimming in oil to use this thing regularly(repairs and fuel)
---
Now the plasma, Pros: Very powerful at close and medium range, better durability, 2 different firing modes(beam splitter is lethal at close range and focuser is good at far targets), plasma cores are easier to get and are used fairly slowly Cons: Doesnt benefit from heavy gunner perks so much less DPS than flamer, Beam splitter lacks at range, if it doesn't have any damage increasing primary effects e.g. bloodied, junkies ect it does shocking damage, mods are hard to get, it does take quite a bit of copper to repair/make plasma cores.
---
In conclusion, the plasma is better if you are always finding yourself short on resources but flamer is better for sheer DPS and range, I also believe it works in stealth very well.
---
It...increases...your...current...firerate...by 25%...
---
Do the math bro.
---
*fast travel to another location on first attempt*
---
This one really made me laugh. Thank you.
---
I've never been able to figure if it's a bug or not...when I did it, the color changed, but the damage didn't.
---
Yes I know I don't have the recipe yet, shut up
---
True but I dont want to put another 2 points in intelligence just for a level 1 computer, nor do I want to get a level 1 a level 2 and a level 3 separately to accomodate
---
There are plenty of folks who look for any opportunity to jump in front of explosive weapons to either
---
- Try and force the owner of the weapon to blow themselves up
---
- Initiate PvP if the explosive weapon is still being used after the event ends
---
Blueprinting lets you make a plan of an entire structure. So you could your camp and theoretically blueprint the whole thing, then use the blueprint to reconstruct all of it in one go somewhere else, and even make multiple copies. Unfortunately the game is REALLY picky about where you can drop structures, so it really works best with small bits of things.
---
I wouldn't consider myself at end game and I can solo queen and earl.
---
jfc it's a bug. they're still a gold item, they're still not tradeable or sellable. They will be fixed and taken out of the loot pool in one or two updates. There's no point complaining about it
---
...and produce decent scrap.
---
The ammo being shoved up our inventories needs to go
---
Don't worry guys I did it on my own...
---
Can you explain the match. I do not understand how this statement works
---
Very interesting bud, thanks! I'll maybe get round to testing, enjoying Wasteland 3 at the moment though, woop!
---
Do you keep your original ranks in the swapped out perk if you ever want to swap back?
---
It changes the color... But Ultracite Gatlings don't have an inherent damage boost against Scorched (although it probably should, lore speaking). Like all weapons you need to prime it to get bonus damage.
---
Yeah they dropped the ball with heavy explosives..so powerful in past fallouts
---
Tattered field jacket for 10 caps
---
its ironic how the backpacks flip this over. I can't get in my power armor without becoming over encumbered
---
can't wait for this to roll around in the atom shop so I can finally snag it.
---
Then what is end game to you?
---
Yeah, I felt like Graham was saying "sorry" by giving me a 1* Fixer after my 3* Tesla glitched away.
---
Fixer plan for 51 caps just a month ago.
---
Most excellent for waving threateningly at kids on your lawn at night.
---
multiple godroll weapons godroll sets. all plans recipes ect.
---
with all of the recent duping I would say the bridge between mid game(50+ non optimized gear) and end game (300+ minimum fully optimized gear multiple godroll weapons)is a rather long one
---
You have a magic minigun is what's happening.
---
Because it just works
---
The length of the condition bar is 100% random. People have tried it with different stats and there is no pattern except that it randomly differs. Intelligence only increases the condition of the crafted item, from 100% up to I think 175%. The only way to get an item with better durability is to keep crafting until you get a good one. Luck, the actual in-game stat, works the same way as intelligence but for items looted in the world instead of crafted
---
Very informative cheers for that:)
---
The Foundation worker outfit is good, too. It makes you look like a gimp with a day job.
---
Math*...Thank you
---
And i think i'm just gonna leave it there as apparently you do not seem to be able to calculate the dmg of your weapon multipled by its firerate.
---
I had problems initiating the tadpole quest.  I think it says investigate the noise, or something like that; but Pompy wouldn’t respond to me.  
---
Bethesda support led me in the right direction.  The daily “Stings and Things” was available to me.   I needed to complete that daily, then Pompy would talk to me.
---
No problem
---
No, because randomly generated legendaries that require currency are what keep people playing the game. If i could craft exactly what legendary I'm looking for, that's potentially hundreds of hours of game play that I bypassed from not having to farm gold/scrip, and now I have the weapon, and use it, and...now I'm bored cuz i got all the things I wanted quickly, so I go play something else. RNG is what keeps people playing.
---
TL;DR gambling is an addiction, seek help.
---
Foundation worker outfit? Haven’t seen that one, how do you get it?
---
Yeah, because as if you didn't know the Bethesda answer to that.
---
Double exp makes the game mode unplayable, anything beyond that will probably turn it into an exclusively hvh mode
---
In Soviet Russia, rug shoot you
---
Ah okay.  I didn’t realize there were balancing changes coming along with the legendary perks.    Are there notes anywhere on what balancing they’ll be introducing?  
---
I’ll keep trudging forward.  Thanks for the reply!
---
No I think you can't calculate the math because you lack the ability to explain it to someone.
---
I have a less than 3 month old PC running a 2080 Ti.
---
Steady 60 almost everywhere except Whitespring Greens.  Also sometimes drops at the lake in Toxic Valley, usually 60 but 40ish from some viewing locations.
---
That said, I'm running a 3-way multimonitor setup so it could be just overload in those spots.  I should check how it runs on a single screen.
---
I doubt Bethesda will do anything about it, honestly.  I'd be well and truly shocked if they even acknowledge it.
---
On a separate note:  imagine being so insecure and selfish that you have to cheat in any multiplayer game.  That's next-level douchebaggery, right there.
---
Bloodied UNY sniper here, my carry weight is 466 while in group, FYI.
---
You have to side with Foundation at the end of the gold heist quest. It's a reward for the quest Secrets Revealed.
---
I like the Fireman uniform, very detailed and looks great. Nice choice.  
---
I’m currently using the Insurgent outfit with the mining mask....I think it looks pretty good.
---
Just saw how to do it, ill have to try it out.
---
I always jump when firing that fucking thing..
---
While it's true that homebrewed cheats can be almost impossible to detect and cheats/anti-cheats are a constant arms race, bethesda has been especially incompetent about it. Until sometime last year, you could get away with running cheat engine on the game out in the open. You didn't need to hide anything, you could just have it open and it would let you modify some things that you really shouldn't have access to
---
That's so weird! I'm only running on a single monitor so I wonder if that's the difference
---
42.
---
Ahh I see... I guess that’s also how one gets the fashionable raider outfit and hat right? Siding with the raiders?
---
Dang...i hurt as I can see..ok ✌
---
TIL camps are actually Tower Defense minigames. Thanks!
---
I speak for a lot of people everytime I play the game go to a event or go anywhere in the game there always a big bag of nades that no one wants because they weight half a pounds and do way less dmg than their  weapon
---
Damn.were you able to pick it up..should have been able to
---
Well for rifle/commando carry weight issue. 
---
Bloodied you use Unyield gear.  That will help with carry weight if u going bloodied route.   
---
you can also use partyboy/girl with whisky to bring up carry weight when needed.
---
I dislike everyone saying its the BOS doing this when its just some guy that heard a BOS transmission and BOS has no idea any of this is going on.
---
People still somehow manage to kill you.
---
The harpoon is a fun gun even if it's impractical and the bloody pickaxe is a solid melee
---
Me out here with my 180th raider torso mod and my third bag of molotovs
---
You know the glitch that makes you a goo puddle so you can't respawn? Shit happened to me when ACP finished.
---
How much would u say the greens &amp; toxic barrel go for?
---
Yep, that's the fashionable raider outfit. I don't have that one yet because I sided with Foundation but on my next play through, I'm going with Crater.
---
Honestly, I assumed we wouldn’t get atoms for dailies in between runs but you never know...I’ve been done with the first run for week or so, doing dailies for rep and a few treasury notes. I was gonna be super pissed if they were “somehow” going to find a way to start paying atoms again. I was kidding when I asked, even though I knew the answer. But I had to ask anyways
---
!RemindMe
---
That was the response I've received.
---
So if you're level 300 and your friend is level ten it's possible for them to kill the same creatures faster than you. Level means next to nothing now.
---
There is hundreds upon hundreds of hours of things to do. Once you get to “max” level 50 for items the game transitions into a farming simulator. Pick your poison on the farm, junk? Legendary weapons? Armor? Events? C.A.M.P. Building? The adventure is yours wanderer.
---
Can confirm from experience.
---
I’d like an ammo stash added to fallout first kinda like the scrap box but holds unlimited ammo
---
What's your build? That doesn't sound right at all.
---
The Mechanist outfit from the atom shop works well, too.
---
I've never had them demand a gun, but I have had one follow me around telling me to come to his camp. I told him no but I left him some stims and water, he kept following me despite me being very clear that I was just trying to do my own thing. I eventually just fast traveled away.
---
The hours I have available to play dictate that yea, indeed, I must fast travel heehee.
---
I actually enjoy exploring the map in part because it gives me more places to fast travel to.
---
Ah I bought it from someone for 5k caps each for the outfit and hat, haven’t finished the story yet. Now I’m thinking of picking the settlers to get their outfit next...
---
(But I do want the slug buster, and from what I heard the raider raid is much more interesting.)
---
I use chem mod right now, but I would be willing to grind for something like this, especially if all ammo is reduced. Focusing on ammo types is pointless for me as I already have bandolier perk card. It would have to be better than the perk cards we already have. So it should apply to all ammo to allow more flexibility with perk cards.
---
Sometimes they do daily deals, this week it was a different plushie on sale every day. Bethesda has an Atom Shop newsletter they put out a few hours after each refresh on tuesday that lays it all out.
---
i explained to a guy recently about how much i like ammo weight reduction armor, just for freeing up 5 perk points
---
They often have 24 hours items on there, I check it daily just in case.
---
I always throw them away, but I aim them at enemies first. Seems like the point.
---
Ah I didn’t even know they released the mechanist outfit, when did that one show up?
---
Damn.sucks for sure.on the other hand we should start to see these things in vendors.give it some time.i bought the colossus 3 headed plan last night for .1 cap.sounds insane but I messaged the seller asking if he wanted more caps for it.that was my steal last night.
---
Gotcha. So this discovery is more about recreating the awesome stuff you did in a construction team, and not about trying to build things you can't otherwise build.
---
That makes sense :) thank you!
---
Oh my god, I thought I was going crazy. I lost my reclaimed mining helmet yesterday as well. Now that I think of it, it was basically right after getting out of power armor too. I was looking all around the map thinking I dropped it by accident, but I guess Bethesda's spaghetti code ate it.
---
I ended up buying another one from a player vender for 3k caps, but I'll stash it away this time in case Beth eats it again. This is so annoying, since I use the flashlight on it all the time and it's leagues better than the light of a normal mining helmet or pip boy light.
---
Stealth Commando and Heavy Guns are both viable and powerful endgame builds. Sniper works at the end game as well, but it's not the best option for Scorched Earth and Colossal Problem. Stealth Commando has the best DPS in the game, Heavy Gunner has the second. It'll boil down to what you like doing more, sneaking around to stay alive, or wearing a tank suit to stay alive. I've played both build extensively and personally prefer heavy gunner. You'll also have to decide if you want to go full health or bloodied, but I'd recommend Bloodied if you're going the commando route. And despite what the other individual said One Wasteland won't change the fact that these builds will be the most powerful ones you can use.
---
I wouldn't scrip anything bloodied as that stuff will sell or trade since so many people play bloodied. I would really like to check out the flamer and could trade up a lever action of some sort (would have to check the details, I have a few) plus whatever else you might want.
---
Level 533? One hundred levels to go, I see. I can do that.
---
All of the half-dozen different damage bugs, and finishing all the incomplete weapons. So much stuff is clearly half-finished and missing crucial bits. I would be able to entertain myself without needing new content if the different weapons here actually worked. There are still some laughable bugs in the game related to them...flamer not triggering friendly fire despite being on the perk card, various perks/effects not working in third person, attachments that are literally missing or providing the wrong buffs, that rare bug where trying to sprint shoots your weapon at your feet...oh, and kindly just fucking ban everybody who has a beam splitter .50 cal already, that stuff stopped being cute about 8 months ago. Not even gonna bother asking for those "adjustments" to explosive energy weapons that were promised 19 months ago, either
---
Nope, it wouldn't be nice at all.
---
Too burned out form the last season, the compulsion to play everyday (if you don't want to spend atoms) is just too strong.
---
And praying and hoping that the challenges have not been completed yet?
---
Ah yeah. I'm waiting to pick up the raider outfit through the quest because the Buried Treasure achievement is the only one I'm missing right now, so I'm aiming to knock that out and get the outfit at the same time.
---
I can't wait to not have to carry water and food everywhere. That'll clear up about 6 pounds I can fill with chems I won't use.
---
Don't script them. Check out https://fed76.info/ to get an idea of value. Then, either sell for Caps via your vending, or offer for trades in the fo76 market sub.
---
Yea we know man but people spam post this every week and it's still the same thing. I doubt they even listen to us at this point
---
Almost every single day there is an item on sale, you should check the store daily which is what they want to entice you to buy something. Normally they add 1 item daily.
---
Why is he being downvoted, he's right 😔
---
Probably over a year ago. Since they tend to bring things back to the atom shop for encore performances I wouldn’t be surprised if it makes another appearance. The brushed metal on the shoulders, boots and greaves matches pretty well with the helmet. Add in the metallic hardcase corvega backpack and it’s not a bad look at all.
---
There is that one legendary perk that makes a chem to fill your hunger/thirst I think. It's something about easier survival. Not quite the same but similar ideas.
---
Glad you replied, I just gave it a try on a single 16:10 screen and yeah, Whitespring has perfectly fine FPS with the smaller viewport.
---
Oh well I have to live with a few performance drops to get ultrawide the rest of the time
---
Goddamit. I love plushies and I missed most of them.
---
Wow!
---
Correct! Vanilla weapons/armors exist in the Purveyor's loot pool by default. Learning the plans for non-vanilla weapons and armors will add them to the loot pool.
---
kinda, they're not that op. a flamer can be used as a sneak weapon, and it's pretty fun. but your average b2525 commando rifle outperforms it.
---
I run two xboxes, I find it crashes more on 1 xbox than the other but it definitely has gotten worse since the last update. But yeah it is frustrating and annoying especially if you take workshops. Hopefully they will deal with it in the next update.
---
Is this only the first time you complete ACP? Or is this EVERYTIME you complete?
---
How u gonna post this and not give a map screenshot lol
---
I stopped trying to do his event, first time was great as a good team showed up and we all had decent gear that we could use to lay into him just enough to kill him before time runs out, every other time after I seem to be the only one actually attacking him while the others just die or go for the smaller wendigos. And then time runs out. And they are all always higher level than me, they nuke the mine, and then they just let the event be wasted. Its honestly aggravating as hell. I also had him glitch into the ceiling and then vanish completely a few days ago and that wasted our supplies and Time as well.
---
Was just about to ask the same thing. 😂
---
8 each day for 8 days
---
We always pay with something, time or currency.
---
Anyways there is no "must" in this game, you could also just walk and take your time. Instead of arriving today you might make it tomorrow, with more junk and saved caps.
---
But it's up to you how you play.
---
If you want it fast and easy, you will always have to use currency.
---
Ah was it released sometime between the first meat week and New Years? Cause I was absent from 76 at that time unfortunately.
---
Also happens if a cargobot/vertibot flies over. The turrets can’t aim up and shoot in the direction. If it hovers over the camp it fires nonstop.
---
I'm on my 3rd divorce.
---
To clarify, Earle drops a 1-3 star, but the *event* drops a guaranteed 3-star. Legendary notifications are buggy as hell, especially around events where you get multiple splash notifications. It will be in your inventory, even if you don't get the notification.
---
Yes, I do, but what throws me off is to go from killing Earl in 15 seconds to it taking 20+ minutes using the same magic weapon.
---
When doing xp runs I always detour there between Huntersville and West Tek.
---
The post isn't about Cursed weapons.
---
A crouched player doesn’t show in the map ... and probably using Chinese Stealth armour ... can stay “cloaked” while moving in crouched position?? 🤔🤷‍♂️
---
I hope so. I could deal with once or twice a day as I expected that when I downloaded, but it freezes a lot and crashes even more, and I just can't take it anymore lmao. Thanks for the reply, I definitely hope they work on it and sort out the problem cause it's driving me nuts
---
Same. Although i have just got a ps4 and final fantasy 7 so that's getting most of my attention at the moment.
---
“effort”
---
aka clicking 2 buttons to start loading another world
---
Did you say you have a bloodied explosive flamer? If so make sure you join a trading forum because that will net you a nice profit.
---
Fix the Bugs. So. Many. Bugs.
---
We don't want massive damage nerfs, maybe just some buffing of worse legendary effects.
---
especially by 60 dude should have his shit handled
---
Play test your own game
---
No, you don’t
---
In the past when people raise the issue enough they respond, now they don't always address everything,and they have to pick and choose which content to focus on with limited resources/time/budget.
---
However this is a extremely easy QoL change they could be making within the next update or two. Hopefully this post gets signal boosted and they decide to add it in.
---
That's how features get considered to be added in when they get enough interest. In  the end you shouldn't try to discourage ANYBODY from posting about the game. Esp when they are not breaking any rules.
---
 No one cares that you are cynical about the games future.
---
Because a few updates ago, they were bugged to start dealing full damage per pellet instead of spread across pellets. Outside of vats, the game corrects it. In vats, it gets broken somehow, probably due to the game forcing hits
---
That is an odd definition of end game.
---
Yeah but I earned it and won it =( Dont wanna have to spend my caps ya feel
---
Weapon weight could also be nice, for bows and rifles at least.
---
Oh nice!!
---
Just like many other attachment bugs in the game, it's because they copy/pasted stuff and forgot to adjust it. It literally has the gatling laser beam focuser instead of an ultracite gatling laser beam focuser. This doesn't affect anything other than the color of the beam though. Same thing with some of the ultracite laser rifle sniper barrels
---
That would drive me nuts, I probably crash maybe once or twice a day .. have you tried clearing your cache to see if that helps ?
---
I camp right beside there.. It was great when I was rep farming. You can build there as well, I've seen some interesting camps that utilize the bathroom building in cool ways.
---
Every time, as long as you successfully complete the event and stay within the event area until the "escape the mine" timer counts down.
---
Lotta worse stuff that needs fixing rn man. A few extra clicks are the least of our worries rn. Ffs, a HUGE damage nerf is coming on the 7th. We are screwed
---
Nope. PC my friend.
---
Not bad... But weapon weight would be nice. Looking at rifle builds.
---
Charging rack could work on energy ammo! As in, you slot your cells into a charger/holder in the bag.
---
Where's all the rum gone??
---
Just snagged the plans for these for only 100 caps not 20 minutes ago. Thanks for the heads up! I love squishing my plushie too.
---
Only possible explanation I got is that they visited your camp while crouching and using their Chinese stealth suit/ or a regular stealth boy. 
---
Why? Some players have trap camps that kill you while you’re shopping. Dropping the floor under them and falling into spikes, or radiating emitters, etc. So people often sneak and crouch and have stealth perks so the owner of the camp doesn’t see them too easily. (And I believe you can’t see them on the map either while they are invisible) 
---
So as soon as he bought your junk he fast travelled out of it. Or he was still there and you just couldn’t see him. 
---
It happens often that people have junk for sale, and as soon as they buy it, they get killed by the owner, who then picks up their junk and sells it again.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3
---
So new Bethesda account, link that to steam, then unlink old Bethesda account from steam.  I unlinked them but they still use the same character.  Fo you have to unlink them on steam too?
---
Are all rank 1 Legendary Perk cards available right away?  And can we swap legendary perk cards as freely as regular perk cards?  
---
Nice summary, thanks for this post!
---
I’ve had the same exact problem, but I also shoot other things and the damage numbers pop up but the health doesn’t go down. It’s pretty frustrating when I have to use double the ammo to get the same amount of damage out
---
That survival perk though could replace the need to carry food/water...maybe free up those perks for carrying all of that. Could become my number two perk after that lockpick one...no more having to swap in and out those stupid lockpick cards.
---
It's tied to framerates and hitting the same spot on the mob.
---
Single target in sneak without a doubt but nothing clears a group of enemies than a splitter on that plasma its nuts. One thing I realised flamer over plasma is no goo piles and the bodies are usually flaming so easier to find
---
Possible I guess?  I use the stealth armour almost exclusively and normally you can still see a player is there, even in crouch mode, especially when you know where to look.  I was right beside my vendor when the purchase was made and turned to give a wave emote, but...poof...nothing there.  It was very strange.
---
Congrats from one level 420er to another 🎉
---
Especially considering tank killer will be applying to pistols soon.
---
FF7 is my fave game ever and this is touching me in all the special places.
---
yeah I see people all the time not on a map, but crouched invisible next/near me.
---
Some stealth around vendors at camps so as not to get hit by boobytraps
---
Yes I’m a shotgun guy high health solar armor to help the team so when I do it I get real close to earl like he’s tea bagging me lol but I get that close to get the most damage with my gauss shotgun and then I’ll jump away before he screams then I look around to keep those minions off the heavy gunners that’s what I do
---
I'm a little confused about what that max means. What would this look like if you're already at 15 STR? and you get the Legendary Strength perk?
---
It’s relatively solid. It’s best for automatics, of course, but it works on rifles as well for an easy cripple.
---
I got it back lol I caught it just in time. Thankfully it was in my camp!

---
And why are you whining that it only takes three people to clear the event when that is literally the point I was making counter to the ops claim you can do it with just two people?
---
Yeah, I even uninstalled entirely and reinstalled and got no change. I may try again just because I really want to keep playing but I don't expect it to fix anything doing it a second time. It makes me big sad
---
Signs and Letters for 1000.
---
Looks like they will be coming but as skins, wether for the Assault rifle or the handmade is hard to say, but i remember seeing datamined pictures of something similar
---
I'm suggesting the world should not be loaded at all until the coordinates of a player's CAMP is checked against the coordinates of players on the world server that is to be joined.
---
The auto retry process could be limited to increments of 5 or 10 before prompting the user as to whether they would like to move their camp or continue retrying.
---
It could take a total of 30 seconds or less to check 10 servers, vs the 9 minutes that it currently takes.
---
The entire auto retry process should be a menu option that users could choose to enable.
---
On my system, the process of finding a world takes a couple of seconds, while the rest of the game load takes up the majority of the time.
---
I have an old computer, but my pci-e ssd scores 2.8GB/s read speed, so it's maybe faster than average, and my storage device does not seem to be a bottleneck.
---
In my tests, it takes 2-3 seconds to find a world, but then another 45 seconds to load the game fully. 
---
I'm using Windows resource monitor the watch usage graphs of hard disk and network activity.
---
During this time, there is a lot of hard disk activity and not so much network activity until very late, after the game assets are loaded.
---
I'm concerned that this 45 seconds of load time is essentially wasted effort each time, because it waits to check CAMP location after the load is finished rather than checking when it says "world found"
---
Cheers
---
It is actually a little more complex than that due to how armor rating is applied. The higher your damage per shot the better you perform against armor, so the aim damage buff does more than 10% more damage, especially against highly armored targets. Unfortunately it's a two shot so you can't easily use [this weapon damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) to get accurate results, but I played around with it a bit and came up with about 9% more damage for fire rate if you are in PA using the stabilized perk, and 5% more if you aren't. Fire rate still wins, but if you're not wearing PA it might not be worth spending 25% more ammo. That's against the scorchbeast queen; the fire rate one does increasingly better against less armored enemies, until you reach 15% more damage against things that have no armor.
---
AH! maybe server lag.
---
I'll need to try it out sometime! One of my favourites also! Loved that game! I've recently got Links Awakening remake on Switch, I get teary eyed playing it, memories!!
---
It’s obviously going to be a skin for the handmade, but as far as I know, there aren’t any storefront images, so it won’t be coming anytime soon
---
What’s the stats for retribution? Does it heal a lot does it not provide i frames now. What’s the damage bonus? Imo they keep it too vague and although it seems to reward a form of skill I think it’ll fall flat.
---
Yes, it's a broken design. It is literally exploited by the users. This is the literal fucking definition. I don't care if you're enamored of the exploitation, that's what it is.
---
Well damn that’s amazing. To me that’s free scrip for legendary modules unless it’s a decent legendary.
---
Chemist backpack is the best thing you can get
---
No, it's no problem.  The important thing is having fun.  It doesn't matter if you get "carried" or anything.  If Bethesda decides to make a multiplayer game, the obvious thing to do is help people as much as possible.
---
The only one that has a resistance penalty is the high capacity mod... which somehow provides more carry weight than a suit of PA with calibrated shocks unless it’s excavator PA. Even then, PA is blown completely out of the water with specific item weight reductions and unyielding on armor. PA could use some help in the carry weight department.
---
Yes making things is awesome especially when they sell like hot cakes I make the ragstag hunting knife the bear arm the fixer and the marine helmet bos officers suit all kinds of stuff
---
Grenades are just free fireworks to me. I throw them in the sky after events.
---
I would subscribe to that
---
That and the disease resistance mixed with herbivore means I was essentially immune to diseases from food/water. Great helmet, looks cool, awesome effects, extremely rare, and it just gets snatched away =(
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
I am really excited for the one wasteland update, only overpowered weapons that one shot everything are receiving major nerfs from the damage calculation. This game isn't even closed to screwed.
---
Many players feel the game is too easy and you shouldn't be balancing your content around bloody unyielding builds anyways, you should be able to balance it around everything.
---
They can't balance it around normal builds since if they don't balance it for bloodied, everything becomes too easy. Vice versa, if they balance it for bloodied then normal builds struggle to keep up forcing more people into a unbalanced meta of only one or two builds.
---
Why would "lotta worse stuff that needs fixing" even be a argument against a QoL change? You just want to argue against the idea of having game improvements that you don't find important? Pretty ignorant.
---
It's as if you just want to bully me by trying discourage posting pretending you are the arbiter of what should or should not be posted.
---
I've done it but he still wont talk 🤷‍♂️
---
Not much, people don't generally want that stuff.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
It depends on your platforms. On PS4, stuff over 7000 caps are hard to sell. Unless you have the perfect 3 starts, on ps4, 7k is pretty much best you can do. May be 10k, but again...it may stay in your vending machine for a while.
---
I’ve found some really neat random encounters involving raiders v mutants there hehe
---
"Pipe is life"
---
Given where zorbo is on this season, and with the messaging from BGS, we probably have 3 weeks or so until we see the new stuff. So yeah, next Tuesday seems super unrealistic
---
Have you ever soloed sbq or Earle
---
The person I decided to help specifically asked on this subreddit for help with a quest.  That's why I decided to.  I also don't really like just randomly dropping stuff for people.
---
Add some ice tea vodka in as well, next level...
---
"Detonation Contagion" Could you imagine someone actually investing in this perk? Lets take the hardest cards to acquire in the game and have them benefit some of the worst weapons in the game. Points well-spent!
---
I think you missed the point.
---
Effort, means my computer's effort in loading game assets that are discarded, and more importantly, the extra 45 seconds of wait time while loading each attempt. 
---
In my case, it can take a total of 9 minutes to attempt 10 world loads.
---
I don't care about mouse clicks, it's waiting a minute between each click that is not necessary.
---
I got downvoted, prob cause I mentioned sentinel assassin. Lmao
---
Nate *Dogg
---
I seen SBQ and Earler both get killed in less than min. by non magic weapons from only 2 people.
---
Legendary perks are still mostly trash.  Nothing is really game changing, or groundbreaking, or allows for a new interesting playstyle or build.  It's a couple QOL improvements, a handful no sane person would ever put perk coins into, and a few that are necessary because there's literally no other option for poison resist for PA users.
---
Plus, the system for obtaining perk coins is beyond stupid.  Hope you don't like playing on alts!  Hope you haven't wasted too many level ups redistributing SPECIAL stats in the last 2 years!  Hope you haven't lost a shit ton of cards from level up packs to the duplicate card bug!
---
There's one word for this whole system:  Uninspired.
---
Does revenant work with power armor reboot?
---
Ya, canned response.... “read” we don’t care enough to look into your problem... but if you keep bugging us, we might.
---
Bloody probably, along with covert operative
---
Answer me, have you soloed either
---
true. but it's also a lot easier to blow yourself up. personally I'm also able to clear out groups faster with the flamer, thanks to vats.
---
but I suppose it largely depends on your playstyle. flamer and the gatling plasma serve different purposes really, it's not wise to use a legacy flamer as your average heavy gun. they break way too fast for that.
---
They did a new plushie every day this week for the 24-hr sale.
---
And yet, NW has weapons with around 700-800 range, and they seem to have no issues with this.
---
If they fixed it for NW, why on earth haven’t they done so in the normal game? I don’t see how this affects balance, especially with pvp in the normal mode likely never happening for the average player.
---
While it doesn’t help ya at the moment...
---
When I get out of work I could gladly donate ya 700 word or so,
---
Beats givin it to Rusty over at Atlas
---
I just wouldn't call level 100ish with a mix matched high health and low health set of legendary armor with weight perks end game
---
Yo mate wheres its at ? You know the savage divide is kinda big
---
Where’s this location
---
Has to be a random event spawn and by itself I think, I could be wrong though.
---
"Keep bugging us" reading you loud and clear there
---
Thanks for the extra g
---
Watch a video. It isn't just any animal anywhere. It has to be a particular set of circumstances.
---
That's bizarre....I've yet to encounter a trap camp.  Shitty thing to do.
---
Don't stress it, g
---
Fuck who knows man
---
I've picked up 3 recently 3k, 6k, and 9k so it varies. Look for high lvl ppl with only a few plans for sale.
---
Same. Not to mention you can sleep anywhere and with any amount of clothing/equipment/weapon as well. Fully rigged in parachute on a plane: check.
---
Can I engage in all end game content? Yes. So it is end game.
---
There are lovely mods for that for PC, on Nexus Mods, cl such as "Silent Allies and more" or "Silent Collectron". Many audio items that may be too distracting cam be silenced.
---
In case you weren't aware: 
---
You wait till after the nuke hits. Then join the mission. When you spawn you are in the cave. No rads. 
---
Now when you kill Earle you have a short timer to loot him and get out of the cave. So when you escape the cave you will be outside in the radiation. You'll need to quickly FT elsewhere or throw on a hazmat suite and sludge it out of the rad zone.
---
You would think so. I've anyone plays the event more than a few times they should see that they are always getting 3 star items.
---
This makes sense too.  It's been brutal lately.  A couple of Earle events have been unplayable.  If not the horrific lag, then the audio is a jumbled static mess.
---
Go to Grafton and you can find pretty much all combat armour plans. Night to to check both vendors
---
No it was not.  You shouldn't buy in-game items from people with IRL money
---
Nope you got ripped off. Could get it for like 5k from another player. It's from a semi rare vendor and looks cool
---
$7?? Like, actual dollars?
---
$7 for an item that costs $0  
---
Yeah man.. Awesome deal 😂👌
---
Maybe you have a magic one?
---
That doesn't mean grenades suck. And I'm playing the same game, and I DON'T see big bags of nads that no one wants, otherwise I would have all the nads.
---
Depends on how you value your time. You could have server hopped for hours trying to find one. I think “good deal” is entirely subjective and plenty of people on here will shit on your for spending real money on an in-game item. Ultimately if you’re happy with your purchase i would say yes, it was a good deal
---
Holy shit. Hide some active quests bro! How does that long list of text not drive you insane?
---
I hope you didn't spend actual money on that..
---
My advice: don’t enter the code.  It’s infinitely harder to keep lowered tiered animals alive when they attack strong enemies.  Leave them in passive mode and sometimes they’ll hide themselves in a place where they’re in no danger at all.
---
Thats whatt im uskng currently, but it all comes down to playstyle and what weapons/build you use
---
[https://imgur.com/lzW3Fv4](https://imgur.com/lzW3Fv4)  it's right where he said it was you lazies.
---
I hope you mean 7 caps and not seven dollars.
---
Hunters Longcoat with the mask also looks nice
---
Change my mind is such an absolutely terrible start to any productive conversation
---
This is also just a low effort post as not a single person who’s not a shareholder or profiting off a quick release will agree with you
---
It also does not matter because people do not hold the company accountable for treating its player and fan base terrible, and sometimes illegally so the companies can keep up this practice cause the simp game is too strong
---
People love to gloss over and act like “it’s not that bad”, “it’s better now”, “I don’t know why / or it didn’t deserve the bad reviews”

All your answers and why this will continue to be a problem while people support shitty companies making shitty products

---
Grenades and molotovs do less dmg than any of my weapons and weight 0.5 lbs they are utterly useless and if you go to any events that always reward throwable a you’ll always see a bag of throwables on the ground because they do no dmg and just weight too much for how useful they are
---
I am unlikely to move my CAMP due to changes that were made that make it impossible to place it ever again. I have a legacy CAMP because of the way my stairway has a wall behind it which is no longer allowed.
---
So all they're doing really is changing the way damage calculation works.  Currently you simply multiple the base damage of the weapon by all damage multipliers.  The way it's going to work though is you first add the multipliers together and then multiply that total by the base damage.  This results in builds that use lots of multipliers losing more damage than builds that use fewer.  
---
The reality is that another damage modifier,  no matter how small, is still more damage.  You aren't going to lose damage by putting on another card.  Bloodied will still be best, but other options will be more available.  I personally prefer essentially a bloodied build but with a vampire's weapon instead.  
---
You lose about 40% of over all damage, but it's really hard to die with a vampire heavy weapon.  In my opinion staying alive and participating is more fun than dying every two seconds but also melting the boss.
---
It was the ACP event that dropped me a bloodied explosive LMG with 90% weight reduction.  But of course, I'm not a bloodied build or a heavy gunner.  Still a pretty epic drop.
---
I don't really mind, if the bug isn't game changing and is one like, the power armor one when your not wearing power armor, your character be coming part of the nether realm, or npc not wearing clothing those ones don't bother me.
---
The one that do are. Respond glitch during events, fast travel bug, legendarys disappearing. I do realize that I can find them with the camera witch I used but the body's were just gone.
---
But yes I would rather content be delayed rather then a buggy unplayable mess.
---
I like bugs they are fun, except the ones that aren't
---
Will do!
---
It goes against terns of service to spend real money on items, that being said I could understand with some items. To answer your question though yes you got ripped off.
---
Yep. My handmades have been doing this for awhile now. My quad tesla does this as well.
---
You are just showing your ignorance. I'm going to take a lucky guess and say you play a bloodied build.
---
I tested a bit.  I crafter two in a row with intelligent difference.  You right, it only increased the bonus condition and not the total. But I noticed the total was same but increased if I did higher level so maybe thats it as well.
---
I like to move my camp around (it is optimized to be able to be put down in a lot of spots).  I love when I get that message.  It means a free move.  I just head out for my daily exploration, and when I'm ready to replenish my supplies and fix gear, I start looking for a spot.
---
Pro tip: if you want to do this, craft your consumables at the **end** of your sessions, so you're ready to roam and adventure without needing access to your camp.
---
I want to see a workshop at the Nuka Cola bottling plant. Yea theirs a quest related to Wastelanders but maybe just a workshop for a portion of it? I want a Nuka Cola assemble line!
---
I stopped playing since i finished mine a little over 2 weeks ago. 
---
Taking a little break until the next one whenever that is ( i actually dont know) is out.
---
Earl is more stationary in his starting position and it's easier to Crit his neck with heavy guns at the start. If I don't take a good 75% chunk within the first 10 seconds the fight is going to dragg it's a tedious resource heavy fight and often I'm trying to do both earl and queen in a 10 minute block.
---
If you have no DPS and are running earle for drops you should probably not be running colossal problem.
---
Even if you don't get earl drop you are still guaranteed a legendary drop often 2 with cursed. That is much more lenient than leechers deserve
---
Dude was alone, 3* perk wasteland whisperer, the animals that spawn beside my camp are completely random( sometimes not even animals ). Dont really get wat else there is to it

Time to wash those gitch Dorsey!
---
I don’t think I’ve had time to collect ammunition or screws while fighting
---
At first it was just my Combat Rifle so my goto was my Handmade... now both are doing it
---
Just fast travel to a point closeby when the event ends before you leave the cave.
---
Yeah I got a cursed pickaxe with bloodied effect +40% damage and +1 strength
---
I hear what ur saying.i remember scrapping scout masks back when they were everywhere. Now they are rare as hell.i would hate to lose 1 or any of the jumpsuits I got from uranium fever. So I get it
---
This is why I don’t use ‘magic’ weapons unless there’s no time left as last resort. It’s a hit and miss at best and gives you false expectations for next battle then you meet with stiff surprises. Just use a good fast firing gun and shoot the target at its weakest spots, you should be able to solo Earle and SBQ, imposter sheep is even easier. I think some youtubers did tests on this too (no legendary effects).
---
3 weeks or so is my guess as well, assuming no delays
---
B2525 Fixer for 16k caps. It’s a trade only item value wise, even at 16k caps it’s a steal!
---
Do not scrip or sell the explosive flamer for caps. It is a legacy and worth trading
---
When you take over workshop that was once owned by someone else, whatever they built in the workshop you can blueprint as your own even if you don't have that item. However if you blueprint a fallout 1st item, you cannot build it unless you are also a fallout 1st subscriber.
---
I have plenty of DPS. What I have a problem with is someone incinerating Earle before the entire group that joined the event makes their way down the mine shaft.
---
The meat tenderizer plan for 1000, which I then traded for a tse gauss rifle, which I then traded for a be dragon, which I then traded for a be15 gatling plasma.  
---
So essentially I got a be15 gatling plasma for 1k.
---
it's not a real secret. When you walk/run during certain quests/missions, it's something you will pass as following a road down is the easiest way to beat the cliffs in that area. Being the only road, it is hard to not pass that building.   
---
The machine is missed by people who do not investigate buildings on their travels and/or people who only use fast travel.
---
Thanks, that was a true laugh out loud for me.
---
Like I said. Watch a video. There are specific locations for this to be able to occur with specific animals. You have to be ranked a certain amount over what you're trying to tame. I'm probably forgetting something but the internet has tons of info. Some of it is even reliable.
---
What platform are you on? If you’re on xbox and you don’t get it back I can let you have my extra one. I’ve been trying to trade it away but haven’t had luck. You seem like you enjoyed it

Yeah shits expensive lol any tips for cap farming?

You won't even need it, since you're gonna get literal shit ton of fuel at Daily Ops btw -))

Think of this, one round of my .50 cal weights .001lbs and does 371 ballistic dmg and a standard grenade weights 0.5lbs and does 200ish dmg in my opinion I’d have to carry 1 lbs of frags just to do the same dmg as my .001 lbs .50 cal round and considering when you throw them the enemy can move out of danger they just aren’t worth 0.5lbs a pop
---
That flamer range is probably the best thing about it  hits farther than vats for me
---
That and mosaic floor designs
---
I don’t really like trap camps. I never really have junk items on me. But whenever I decide to shop around I always look for a stash box or scrap box first. If you don’t see ANY type of stash anywhere. Chances are it’s done on purpose so you don’t put your junk away. Most of the times the stores are inside the house. Forcing you to go in. 
---
I personally love when people have their stores outside on the ground or somewhere easily accessible.
---
Yeah, use one of the rarest outfits in the game
---
Yep.
---
I've wondered if it's related to the Quad problem.  Sometimes if you have a Quad weapon, and you switch to a different, non-Quad weapon at just the right time, the Quad property carries over to it.  So you end up with a Bloodied Lever Action Rifle that holds dozens of shots.
---
The premature auto-reload strikes me as the inverse of that.  That you'd trigger the reload well before the magazine is zero.
---
I've noticed that tall grass also adds an extra layer which increases the cost of vats and dedcreases damage done.
---
Better yet, don’t change the game mechanics of prompting when destroying something undroppable. Just make them drop and tradable instead.
---
No... I said Bethesda could use the fireman outfit mesh to make a matching outfit for the helmet. Did you not read my post?
---
Point of my post wasn’t “Oh just use this insanely rare outfit”, it was “Bethesda can make a matching outfit from this one.”, as in create a new outfit and add it to the ACP rewards.
---
(Apparently most people didn’t get that since the post was downvoted seconds after being uploaded.)
---
He keeps moaning and cannot move
---
I could be wrong but looks like some dumb ass cheater?
---
What's nice is that you can have decent damage and still have high carry weight/qol stuff.  I use 4 carry weight perks and do fine for damage.
---
It seems to go like that ...
---
I have 1 character who is still running with a suppressed fixer at level 170.. just can’t find anything .
---
On the other hand my level 120 shotgunner I started a few weeks back has some great shotguns that have dropped or I’ve bought for less than 1k.
---
My heavy gunners have pretty much every type of heavy weapon you could ask for.
---
He has a nice butt
---
How can you be screwed or punished for something that didn't yet exist?
---
I recently (in the last day or so) changed from a sniper to commando build. I went from using a 50cal single shot rifle to an auto Fixer and noticed this. Like you said it is completely random when it decides to reload, sometimes 1 shot left another time 5 shots left, sucks.
---
I don't get how it's being punished? They give an option and you chose one of them.. might be a good idea to store points before trying something new incase you don't like it.
---
Or a pharmaceutical company.

Are you saying you spent real money on it?
---
If so, not only are you breaking ToS, you got ripped off AND you paid real money for an item you knew nothing about, which is dumb by itself.
---
Y'all don't need more backpack mods.  The fact that you can carry as much as someone in power armor is already ridiculous.
---
&gt; Raising Intelligence decreases the number of words when hacking terminals.
---
Well, ya learn something new every day!
---
Don’t listen to people who get onto you about the 7 dollars. Dang near every one of us has spent 8+ dollars on atomic shop clothing over and over and over and over .......
---
Just don’t accidentally scrap it
---
Q: **Far-Flung Fireworks**  does the body explode at the moment of dead or is it somewhat delayed? Rushing ghouls have the tendency to keep moving forward when getting killed and usually end at the feet of my rifle user. Physics are sometimes really odd.
---
Some people feel that way. For me, it renewed my interest in playing and I miss the grind of getting the challenges done.
---
Only run it a few times because I did not know this. Thank you stranger. Two questions:
---
1. Do you have to loot Earle, the chest, or neither to receive the 3*?
---
2. Does anyone have a link to the data mined loot list?
---
Lol
---
It's more like no, not reasonably.  Not unless they want to grind a ton of xp.
---
He knows it going to happen soon so he is talking about the poorly designed legendary perks preemptively punishing people for having build diversity, so yeah it does kinda screw him and others over when the new update comes out.
---
Lol I’ve never had enough time in that event to farm screws....
---
It's probably best not to say that here, least of all Reddit.
---
Because the whole perk coin system wasn't revealed until a few months ago.  The options until then were either try different builds, purchase cluttering duplicate cards for no reason, or do nothing at all.
---
I try doing this all the time. But I've noticed they don't want help anymore.
---
The noise is the best part 😀😆🤣
---
Every weapons are affected by armor resistance. Let's just keep it basic. I knew exactly where this champ above you was trying to bring me. And with all honesty I base my conclusion on the numbers that are poping above my enemies and they are amazing to watch. I see constancy...nothing suspisious. To me...25% firerate, tells me that i my weapon has a 25% performance increase. 
---
Sorry dude, but i've read nothing about the fact that enemies resistance performs better against high firerate weapons.
---
I'm not trying to be rude here. But excuse me if i fail to understand the logic behind what you are trying to explain me.
---
Whining?
---
Eh.  Someone asked on here for help with a quest, so I decided to help them.
---
Yes this game is too hard and we need even more OP gear /s
---
sinseer is a psychpath who can‘t tell game and real live apart anymore. given his playtime (8k hours), absolutely no wonder. extremely invested in other people, talking behind their backs, etc. he sucks major dick.
---
Yep, I've changed build on my main character about 5 times since i started playing. That's a lot of wasted perk points...
---
Yea just mod it like any other combat rifle (it takes CR mods)
---
Equip the fireworks grenade. It speeds up reloading time on any equipped weapon. Thanks to angry turtle for informing us.
---
What I've noticed is that it's a visual bug. It goes down to 0 ammo left then quickly goes to some number of ammo left. Seems to only happen with automatic weapons.
---
Basically 1 perk. Stabilized. That's the difference. Use PA for boss fights equip Stabalized and melt. It increases accuracy and 45% armor penetration. Honestly combine this with an AA25ffr or 33% mini and you'll rip.
---
Okay thanks I wasn't sure wich mods it used
---
I think in terms of automatic rifles, the Handmade outclasses everything by quite a margin, except maybe the Fixer.
---
Like, it's not even funny just how much the janky Handmade hits significantly harder than the Assault Rifle.  But that's one truism about 76's balance - if the weapon came from Fallout 4's DLC, it generally overperforms in 76.  This is because back in 4, these weapons used a rarer ammo type that was only available in the DLC, so they were "balanced" by the tedium of trying to acquire that ammo.  In 76, they've all been changed to more common types, but they retained their OP damage.
---
How long season going to be live? When is a end date?
---
You have to scrap combat rifles to
---
learn the mods.
---
Plus factor in the annoyance of looking for the bodies
---
What about delayed and still buggy ?
---
It's only like 7k caps or so.
---
I do not mean that we are underpowered but that we have multiple useless legendary effects which make the only viable options for classes bloodied / junkies
---
What if I planned on using a flamer? Still worth it?
---
Thank you, some people are taking this post way to seriously and even thought these challenges were data mined and real! 😂
---
Yeah I commented without looking at the board, didn’t realize Zorbo was almost at the end. I finished a week and a half or so ago so in my defense, it’s been a little bit since I’ve looked at the game board. That’s my bad OP, hope I didn’t get your hopes up
---
From what I've seen with PA, emergency protocols are suuuper good and a selection of perks make you tanky as hell even at bloodied threshold. Especially if you have a vampires heavy weapon. But as a non PA youd sacrifice a bit of survivability for the fact you're alot faster and can use serendipity and dodgy and at bloodied you can use unyeilding for stealth, intelligence, and other good stats. On the flipside the flamer is really good while out of PA because it's considered a silent heavy weapon so you van pull of sneak crits saving ammo. Plus with the large AP pool you can use some weapons with vats, the best is gatling gun and plasma caster, both pack s punch and hit well in vats
---
Whoa he has no asshole 🤔
---
Agreed, some people don't understand the term 'subjective value.' Completely off topic but also relatable to alot of gamers, a prime example is some like to get stoned and don't mind spending money on weed, but others think it's a waste of both time and money.
---
I just spent $60 on the Atomic shop coind this weekend alone
---
Cool, you should check out a trading sub instead of this one where your post will get deleted.
---
I hate the idea of seasons. I like my rewards, but cannot stand feeling like I have to complete challenges daily. Would rather just play the game and enjoy it. It’s a distraction.
---
I use them mainly to force the enemy out of the spot they are hiding in. I noticed that they are programmed to move fast when a nade is by them.
---
The enclave have them :p
---
You still need diffusers? I sell them hundreds at a time in my camp. I can give you a couple. What’s your GT?
---
500 caps once. Otherwise no.
---
I bought out the last 25% of the legendary run. I bet my bottom dollar some of the ones here telling you you got ripped off did the exact same thing
---
Till 15 September
---
After 15, you don't get additional card slots but you get the other bonuses like carry weight, at least afaik
---
The armour is good enough with a full set, each piece gives 15%, for a total of 75%. Although I do believe many slayer options should be able to double damage instead of 30% onto specific enemies.
---
Oh sorry I misunderstood, thought you meant just regular level up points not actual perk card coins. I see what you mean now and yeah that's a pita
---
I'd love that bloodied exploding lever action! Yeah, definitely don't scrip that stuff! It's valuable!
---
Yes you can, however it has to be HALF your level and it can't be a deathclaw that spawns for a location or event...like at death claw island for example.
---
It has to be a random deathclaw you find in the wild.
---
You also need animal friend 3 to tame them run up to them and click tame. 
---
You can see tameables on this map.
---

---
Level 25-35 imo is the hardest part of the game because you feel too powerful for the forest and toxic valley but too weak for the savage divide.
---
Keep grinding levels and increasing your damage output. Pick a weapon class and stick with it. Once you get to level 50 the game gets much easier and you can re-spec or fine tune your build.
---
Oh, I agree.
---
But at the same time, if you need to delay something, don't wait until the last minute to announce it.
---
My current character is level 120 and doesn’t use a single legendary weapon, my main weapon is modded pipe revolver. I completely disagree with the premise that the only viable weapons are bloodied/junkies. I can do close to 1k per shot. 
---
We don’t need to buff weapons anymore just because something else may be more powerful. Lots of weapons are viable without min/maxing.
---
In the AAA realm Fallout 76 is king of UI gore &amp; I would never want to take that title away from it.
---
To each their own. What you’re saying makes sense, especially if you’re solo... but I like when they’re more aggressive because I’m not chasing them down and I can keep them alive with the sword while killing ads.
---
Ask Wick.
---
Stimpak diffuser plan for 10caps
---
What does it benefit from then?  Demo expert?  Would have been nice to know before I tested it and thought it just did terrible damage in general.
---
Whoah not bad
---
People can get level 500 in a few weekends effectively maxing out all legendary perks.  Since the first reveal of the legendary perk system they have slowly made it easier and easier and now many people will just be walking around fully maxed out with legendary perks.  I have seen that there is no end to the complaining and people will continue to complain about "being punished" until they make everything free.
---
PC but I appreciate it!!
---
The clapping of those cheeks is the most terrifying thing about him.
---
OP has said nothing wrong and he is exactly correct, Bethesda really dropped the ball with legendary perks.
---
Bloodied explosive Lever Action 2500 caps
---
Reclaimed mining helmet 41 caps
---
Hey xbox player here,
---
1. I can't really answer your bloodied gauntlet need question but I believe there is a thread here about the nerfs in general.
---
2. I think dupers got onto xbox somewhat in the past 2-3 months and alot of plan prices and items seemed to be somewhat devalued from what I've noticed so i think this has caused people to sell other items like ammo and legendaries for ridiculous prices and alot of vending machines are stocked with the same plans. I would also say on Xbox I've seen a lot more aesthetic based camps like going for a theme or particular organization so it tends to make vending machines hard to find. 
---
On another note I would say depends on the server as lately my fiance and I when we play kind of hop servers until we're on a populated one with events running and we tend to find a lot better plans, items and just general fun this way.
---
daaaaaaang
---
It might be from a mod that adds energy damage?
---
You need to protect your wood man.
---
Enjoy it until the next patch. Magic for bash damage is fixed in the PTS according to several people.
---
There is lead node right next to the event spawn.
---
Thanks! That was helpful. Can you just aim your gun at them like you can in F4? That would seem more safe than just running up to them
---
1. Every form of dmg is being nerfed. Its not as bad as the internet has been making it seem ( i play the pts )
---
2. Vendors on xbox typically suck, look for the 200+ players and level 50s that stay at that level, they're the traders with the good stuff.
---
And right on! Finished a while back and loved what wastelanders added.
---
I did that for a while....then I got sidetracked.
---
Well I do like 3k with a full automatic assault rifle and do up to 10k with snipers and my mele character dose 10-15k per swing
---
Mele character lvl 81 main lvl 150
---
Yeah they released Wastelanders WAY later than originally planned and it was still a buggy mess. I've come to expect nothing more from the game and just enjoy the content as much as I can.
---
Legacies haven't benefited from demo expert in a while, also what gun are you talking about, I assume the plasma
---
It was a sweet deal. I was just browsing for stuff...saw a bunch of common outfits priced the same...and then  there they were...lol. Snatched those up real quick! 😂
---

---
Agree!
---
I finished last week and I haven’t played since. On the first day after finishing I logged in almost automatically and I was like: “What am I doing here?”
---
If there wasn’t double XP, double dailies and extra daily challenges, this would be a terrible grind and I treated it like it was, because you couldn’t plan for these extra SCORE thrown your way. I felt like I had to get ahead of the curve early to account for those days where I couldn’t/didn’t want to play.
---
I guess what I’m saying is that if they keep the numbers of daily challenges stable and maybe even announce the extra SCORE opportunities before the whole thing started, it wouldn’t feel so much like an obligation.
---
Yeah.  I have a be15 plasma and it does absolutely no damage.
---
Are you shots from VATS and targeting a player? Cause nothing in VATS works for me vs people.
---
Booty!
---
Dat ass
---
The hacking, yes, but there are other cheats in console mode that people are using
---
Sounds like me in the morning *ba dum tss
---
In bloodied mines does quite a bit but much less than the flamer, I think it got nerfed since the dupe wave
---
I have no idea why you are trying to go so hard on legitimate criticism of legendary perks.
---
It's dumb that you have to scrap cards for any reason at all since i use more than half my cards with multiple weapon types/builds.
---
A full set of power armor gives a 90% rad reduction independent of radiation resistance.  Due to the scaling you're not going to get that kind of reduction just off increasing radiation resistance alone.
---
I'm pretty sure it's some sort of glitch
---
I play at least 8+ hrs a day so the challenges completed without me focusing on it. Finished it about 3 weeks in. Totally know most can't do that. Rewards were fun enough. Glad you Finished man !
---
Darn. Sorry about your helmet I hope it gets fixed!
---
The most annoying one is with gat lasers, it leaves a whole bunch of near to half empty cores in my inventory.
---
Large water purifiers.  Easiest cap maker.

---
Is that confirmed or an assumption?
---
Ok? Did you read what I wrote? Are you saying my non legendary isn’t viable? It’s more than adequate to fight any enemy in the game lol. You doing more damage is irrelevant.
---
You are amazing! Thank you for all you do &lt;3
---
I prefer excavator.  If you test the resistances in live fire, they all protect you the same.
---
I just make sure to not be on at 12pm. I haven't had the autocomplete bug yet.
---
In 10mins
---
I can't Even sell stimpak diffusors for 100caps a piece on PS4 lom
---
Yeah but you still have to keep taking the chem. but it would be nice to be able to free up those thru hiker points.
---
As the other guy said, there was a Handmade skin datamined some time ago that turns it into an R91.  I also remember watching a video of someone actually using it and it looked great.  It seemed complete so I have no idea why they haven’t released it yet.
---
To me, this seems to be the one solution to all problems kind of thinking. 
---
What one weapon will give me the best results in most situations. Grenades aren't meant to be used to completely kill all the mobs in an area. And not all grenades work the same on all creatures. Frag grenades work well on Super mutants, often crippling them. While Pulse grenades work best on robots. 
---
Also, it's not about doing the SAME amount of damage. It's about creating and advantage for yourself, through tactics. For example. If you know the layout of the entrance to West-Tek, you can toss in a grenade and explode the vehichle there, hit the ground and set the fuel that's spilled. And in doing so, sometimes take out the mutant hounds, or even a super mutant, like the suicider.
---
It's quite possible to take out several mobs there, with one simple grenade. 
---
Same with using a few pulse grenades against things like Assaultrons and Mr Gutsy's.
---
Its not as tanky as it use to be but its tanky enough.
---
flamer is also a heavy gun, so yes. *some* armor piercing is always important.
---
you mean to use it as a sneak weapon? is it legacy? are you a bloodied build?
---
I can't recommend regular armor for a bloodied build. either go with sneak or PA. you'll die way too fast otherwise.
---
Angler queen!
---
Hmm... 300 perk coins × 26 different perks = 7,800 coins.  Sounds free to me lol
---
I share lone Wanderer!
---
If this were any other fallout game you wouldn't even be able to change build at all
---
Yuuuup
---
Yes.  I like waiting till they are swimming in ghouls and then I drop in like Batman.
---
Holy fuck
---
I thought I had a lot of hours at ~1200... But he didn’t invest himself in me. Seems like a good thing.
---
I saw that video too, I have no idea if they will release it sometime after the steel dawn release, but if they have fallout 3 related stuff coming soon I hope they would release it with that
---
Yeah same!  They could make a prefab shack like those you see in Fallout 3 and New Vegas.  We need more scrappy and post-apocalyptic stuff, I can’t get enough of it!
---
Yeah I’d very much enjoy having access to the various scrappy wooden and metal walls from fallout 4, they allowed you to make a lot of very unique looking building with some very interesting shapes (the tubular metal bunker style pieces for example)
---

The names on some perks are outdated, but I believe they are all.
---
O_O
---
I'll play fine for hours on one day.. the other I crash within minutes of each other. Yesterday was really bad.
---
Xbox one s.
---
I randomly drop stuff all the time for people.  But it’s scrip or a legendary or serums.  Not bum armor
---
Same with tents.
---
Wow this is a great calculation link thank u very much! According to this i wont be able to finish on time unfortunately but i think i will buy my remaining ranks at the end of legendary run with atoms
---
Woah woah woah what you squish in the privacy of your bedroom doesn’t belong on here.
---
Condition and luck of the draw are based on hits, not shots fired 
---
If you hit 10 ghouls it will lower the condition by 10 points worth, but you'll have 10 seperate chances to proc the repair
---
Hmm. Maybe my framerates were much higher at the very start of the fight since the fight had not yet begun. Also, I was targeting one body part while Earl was in his starting position. Also, I may have been getting a sneak bonus.
---
I downvoted this
---
Maybe, but you can hear the difference between the shot counts when it reloads early. Like the timing is off and it cuts out early. I thought of trying to count the hits/shots to see if that was the case, i just don't know how to accurately do that. I was also thinking it could be server lag or like a syncing issue to where it shot the full magazine server side but you only see it empty 3/4s.
---
Damn..great minds think alike i just literally posted something similar just recently where players should be able to combine things displays/bobbled heads/etc. 
---
I fully endorse this idea!
---
The magic heavy weapons are most affective if Earl is standing still.  You’ll need to cripple him to achieve that.  One Gun Army to cripple with heavies. OR, commandos can use Tormentor and Concentrated Fire to highlight limbs and cripple him pretty quick.  
---
I encourage everyone to keep doing this event.  It will get better as more people learn the dynamics.   I’m on PC and haven’t had a failed event in over a week.  I feel like players are figuring it out.
---
I feel exactly the same. the legendary run sucked the fun out of the game for me. used to play most of the day, since I started taking the legendary run seriously I'd just log in, get my chores done, log off.
---
finally finished it yesterday and was able to enjoy the game again. no way I'm doing season 2, screw that.
---
Yes. With the new red chinese atom shop power armor paint you can add a jet pack to the excavator armor! (Chest piece only)
---
Only specific animals can be tamed
---
And for what reason? It was a suggestion for Bethesda to make a matching outfit for the cool helmet they added, something people have been asking about a lot recently.
---
I saw one yesterday while out exploring with my friend. It was not aggressive to me but was to my friend. 
---
I saw I could tame it so yelled “don’t kill it, don’t kill it! I want to—“ He killed it. I was sad.
---
For 76?
---
They have said mid September so around that date
---
Which jetpack comes up? If that isnt isn't a pay to win lol
---
Because it’s bad
---
Yes that is what I am saying the only non legendary things that are viable is 
---
Shadowd leather 
---
Shrouded wood
---
Fixer
---
Tenderizer 
---
Handmade
---
And even if you have those you are gonna have a hard time with Earle or SBQ and I am not saying that you can’t kill SBQ without legendarys but I am saying that it will be tough.
---
So you can scrap basically *all* your spare cards in order to unlock these relatively minor improvements. 
---
Great if you're super dedicated to one specific build. personally I think I'd rather retain the ability to swap builds around within the same character. Especially something like the str tree where you can swap out heavy, shotty, and melee.
---
I feel like I'll be scrapping about 1/2 of my unused cards, the ones I know I most likely will never use.
---
I've killed dozens of people with a trap camp, they are fun to make and usually score you some junk
---
Just be glad he didn't inflate his colossal sac on you while you were down there
---
I pair mine with a full set of heavy raider armor.  Looks good IMO.
---
Why the hell would someone capable of nuking your base demand to give em your x?
---
That's one toxic behavior.
---
Alright, just gonna block you then since you’re being a prick.
---
Can I buy it off you ? On Xbox
---
You still have to build it with fluxes. It ain't just 'free'
---
It may not be relevant. Might just have stims and the like in it. I suspect that the big rewards are all on Earle or given from the quest itself.
---
I only ask because I’ve never completed it with enough time to really assess what’s going on there at the end. It’s always a mad scramble to make it out alive, which is fun don’t get me wrong - but posts like this help us prioritize in the moment. 
---
FWIW, the instructions I’ve seen and been adhering to are to loot Earle ASAP upon death and then to GTFO. I suspect that’s still sound advice even given this news of a guaranteed 3*.
---
not that anything would come of it, either. he likes to pretend that he has a big community of followers but then you look at his videos and it‘s one like and 10 dislikes, 200 views. dislike towards him is justified. i can only speak from personal experience, but yeah. the stories pile up, lol. 
---
i‘m with you on the amount of hours, lol. 8000 is just insane. i‘m a bit over 1000 myself and i too think that‘s already a lot, given that the game hasn‘t been out for THAT long. but sinseer has probably played more hours than the devs spent on their own game, combined. :D

 &gt; Juicy!

Why does it always have to be power armor vs regular armor? 😑 
---
Ya can take advantages of it while not in PA
---
If you want ridiculous how can power armor carry anything but a weapon? Theres zero storage, no  pockets, nothing but a suit of armor, you couldn't even carry extra ammo,snacks,water, drugs without pulling around a cart like a damn pack mule if ya think about it....
---
Well thanks again...It was super fun and I had a blast playing solo last night now that those missions were out of my way.
---
Awesome captures and commentary!  I once sat back and watched a mothman take on a sheepsquatch in the cran bog.  The mothman was dust in about 20 seconds.  I too rewarded the sheepsquatch with a dirt nap.
---
The problem is that nearly every part of the game distracts away from the game itself. You need to make sure to clear caps every day, use your daily scrip machine allotment, turn in 20 treasury notes, run your score chores, and then maybe have some fun if there is still time.
---
I'm currently taking a bit of a break after finishing the run, but I need to drop weight so I hopped on to do my daily limit stuff. It still took me almost 20 minutes last night just to do caps (sold 700 fiberglass thanks wendigo spawns), buy gold, turn in notes, scrip and turn in one Ward quest since I was there anyway. Too much time spent doing chores nowadays.
---
So many morons on this sub I swear to god
---
The fire rate mod is in the receiver options
---
How much ?
---
literally posted this morning
---
Responders Fireman Outfit and Urban Scout Mask for a few caps.
---
yup it's pretty strange. I'm a power armor user so I found this out pretty early, you don't have to worry though, you get all the score still
---
I feel your pain, I don't carry any grenades since they are basically dead weight.
---
Traded a ts ffr fr hm today for more flux then ill use in the lifetime of the game.
---
The tenth week is up next tuesday, same day as when Zorbo reaches lv 100.
---
They said they plan on having a two or three weeks break between seasons, so the next won't be released until late this month.
---
The number of people who don't realize there is a daily clock in the game is shocking to me.
---
Your point is poorly written. Add some paragraphs, i am not reading that without some fixing.
---
Could anyone let me know what’s new for this week? Just started my shift
---
I don't run tesla's I was talking about Tesla 5 which is -20% heavy ammo used.
---
Because some builds essentially require pa and I don't think it's fair for pa to be less viable than regular armor with all of its legendary effects and backpack, under armor, etc.
---
What ever you think is fair
---
Any time... member.
---
a week or 2 ago i entered my first trap camp, dropped me into a fiery radiating pit.. i was able to fast travel out so i lived.. its messed up but i gotta say its pretty clever.
---
Yeah, I think it would work in displays like the comic book racks and magazine racks.  If you scrap it you should get them all back too.
---
Yeah. Back when I was in the WVR, a Discord faction that was a *total* shithole, that was when I came across him. But he was using an alt, exposed at a later date.
---
Oh Russell... we talked about this.
---
Then you have written it for no reason considering you are trying to talk to me. Your loss.
---
Simple - reward one perk point per level instead of making it dependent on scrapping cards.

I'm playing on Xbox my handmade quad rifle has been fine with the exception that it occasionally like stops firing when it gets lower ammo almost kind of like a laser Gatling or minugun so it prompts me to reload early so I never usually get to waste the 90 rounds I have . Not sure if it's the same issue but I have noticed this rather recently.
---
Yup. I was just attempting to state the literal fact that this issue has been around long before hacked weapons hit the scene, as multiple players firing legit weapons can reach that same number of effects per second.

Lol why isn’t it viable? I don’t think that word means what you think it means.
---
Cloth is listed, you'll need to clear your cache to see it.
---
A deathclaw is one of them
---
I been doing the event Collision Course.  It can be started by the player and yields 100 pre war money which can be scrapped for 100 cloth for each player that joins the event.
---
Man that would be awesome! I’m WestRider85
---
Can you solo SBQ?
---
Yeah this only works for physical damage. This is why you can rad yourself with a gamma gun with the buff on.
---
Fireproof perks are ignored by anything that isn't physical explosions.
---
YES
---
**THE THEREMIN IS BACK**
---
True in life. Who knew FO76 could so perfectly mirror reality? Heehee.
---
Lol worst atom shooter update yet

 &gt; Cloth is listed, you'll need to clear your cache to see it.
---
I don’t feel compelled to max out those limits every day. There are always more days to earn gold. There is no rush. The legendary run is different. I can play the main game however I want without seasons.
---
All I want is the gold .50 cal skin back :(
---
Thats it? Old stuff and a jukebox. Pretty sad
---
Thanks buddy i love these weekly postings
---
digging that juke box.
---
Thanks again for the post.
---
Autism game on point
---
Where is this clock?
---
Yeah! You’ll never run into NW cheaters if you never play it! 
---
In all seriousness it’s a big bummer but they really don’t give a shit about the game mode. No anti cheat, no meaningful updates, etc.
---
Even with the nerf bloody unyielding will still be the best build, instead of doing 300 damage more, it will do like 100 damage more. The thing that got nerfed the most is all stacked damage, including chems/perks cards etc.
---
Under the old formula it could theoretically be possible to multiply your damage to damage cap, now they made the dmg sources additive to base damage of weapon.
---
So you will always receive the same amount of damage boost from 20%  for all damage sources, instead of multiplying damage upwards for each new damage number.
---
So under the new additive formula 20% of 40 base weapon damage is 8 points, so every source of damage you get that boost your damage by 20% will give you 8 extra points of damage.
---
So under the old formula that multiplies your damage would go from 40&gt;(8+)48(+9.6)&gt;57.6(+11.52)&gt;69.12(+13.824)&gt;82.92 etc.
---
So that means it just keeps multiplying for every new source of damage until you get godly powerful weapons esp. when they are automatics/saws with fast fire rates or have high base damage.
---
It just creates too much of a damage disparity between optimized builds with lots of synergy like bloodied and normal builds that only have so many sources of damage.
---
lots of people will be happy about the contemporary set being back
---
I have one of those in my stash I got it as a reward i think and it looked cool so it hung on my wall at the moment.
---
Eh, a bit generic. I’ll pass
---
Eh, disappointment like usual.
---
That jukebox is way overpriced
---
daily/weekly challenges.
---
Someone will be happy about the Camo.
---
Not me, but someone
---
Anything new for F1st?
---
yeah it was just posted.
---
I had a face mask way back on my first character, I’ll have to look and see if I still have it , I’ve probably scrapped it though, I hate to think what I sold, scrapped or script over the past few years!
---
Thaaank you...✌
---
I had to log off to avoid seeing half my challenges automticly completed...
---
😐
---
Kind of a disappointing week. Thanks for posting.
---
Intelligence is my dumpstat.
---
I’m going to Downvote every single post and comment you make.
---
I think we are refering to the same door.
---
Yes but only specific deathclaws work
---
Does the Jute box play the same classical music as the regular one or does this one have the option to play the radio?
---
Oh I knew that I don't know what I was thinking
---
Thank you most kindly :)
---
Thank you! 
---
Im happy the contemporary is back.
---
I bought the RR camp pack last time and mine definitely didn't have stairs. Everything else though. Kinda sucks.
---
No. Is that your definition of viable? Lol she’s not intended to be solo’d. There is a different between OP and viable.
---
I have in my stash, thats what throw me I got to lewisburg and fought some mole miners all about level 16 and 18 with one level 22, then went to fine beckett and suddenly everything was level 45-50 and above and I didn't see any nuke drop while I was on the server.
---
Yeah i can imagine pretty cool set
---
that's some good tactics there. I find that if you start with a grenade and they don't know you are there, the don't move out of the way. It depends on the situation.
---
Well, IF you go bloodied/unyielding you get The best from both worlds. High damage and carry weight from a ton of strength. But rundning around with 20% health is probably not for everyone.
---
Same I love the reload animation and sound
---
Idk, last week set the bar pretty high. There’s a couple decent (albeit overpriced) items this week.
---
Bethesda fix!!!
---
Well not anymore it isn't. lol
---
This used to be a very high chance spawn for the squatch till they added wastelanders encounters there and diluted the chances.
---
Still a great spot though.
---
I just saw on insta that it ends on the 8th
---
I carry close to 80-100 cores.
---
Just as a general head's up: it still plays the same music as the regular Jukebox. Damned fancy lookin', but still.
---
It's an ongoing online game, changes happen all the time. Look forward, not back.
---
Where is the BOS fatigue 😞
---
they dont like keyboards to be used on this game, as evidence by a lack of text chat.
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah u right
---
If you want a tank get a V2515rl minigun. Emergency protocols. Calibrated shocks. Targeting Hub. Now just stand beneath the queen or colossus and be god...
---
Vault-Tec Armor bench.
---
Ooffff, that title is too accurate.
---
I use power armor with emergency protocols, dodgy, ricochet, and a vampire's weapon at 20%  health.  Pretty much don't die to regular enemies.  I die to bosses occasionally when I'm not paying attention.
---
well damn
---
Same here on Xbox one. The game isn't worth grinding if I can't earn score.
---
Well thanks...I've been visiting there quietly for ages now...now everyone will be going by.
---
Does anyone have pictures of the Sniper Outfit on a male character?
---
Apparently it's the same as the generic Jukebox.
---
Not sneak. Probably junkies, vampire or furious. Im too poor for legacy anything.
---
Nah bro saying someone is crying about something when they’re literally asking a question about something they’re not fully educated on is being a drama queen. People like this are the reason most people don’t ask for help because they’re met with hostility for just trying to learn something new.
---
everything is double score i hear, so maybe that will help?
---
Fine by me :)
---
Auto completes making it impossible to complete. Fuck this game.
---
Me too. I think the LR burned me out on 76 for a while. I finished two weeks ago, and after running a bunch of CO events, I no longer even have the desire to log in.
---
Some friends talked me into NW, but with nothing new except hordes of gauss shotguns replacing toobers, I'm losing interest in that, too. 😔
---
On a related note, the game preview of Grounded in Game Pass is entertaining...
---
Juke box looks cool and all... but seems expensive for just a fancy radio
---
Especially with a suppressor on them.. lol range stat of 6.
---
Yeah the book building when you load in. Hundreds of burnt books in there, best place on the map for cloth, great for gunpowder.
---
I wonder if the extra power is the source of the reloading early glitch. I only seem to start to auto reload after 500 shots and sometimes it feels like I shot 999 rounds go to reload but can interrupt because I have 18-62 shots left, which may just disappear after I start shooting again.
---
Thats not how game development works.
---
An asset artist who makes new items and skins is not the same guy who fixes coding bugs.
---
Netcoder is not going to work on outfit clipping issues.
---
A quest designer is not gonna fix power armor bugs.
---
Why dont people understand this? you dont call a plumber to fix your PC.
---
Lame...
---
We've been saying for a while that the Jukebox should come in the same variants as the radio does.  The default Jukebox music drives me nuts.
---
That would be amazing if some of those mods could come to consoles.
---
Surprised the Steel Dawn fatigues aren't there.
---
The vertibird is most likely going to be season 3 finale reward
---
Yeah because we'd have max special and skills
---
I grabbed that as soon as I saw it lol
---
Yeah the first dude kept doing the angry emote at me so I taunted him once and he started shooting at me so I fired a missile into his face, next thing I respawn and met with him minigunning my whole base down
---
Thanks for saving me the atoms.
---
you 100%? they aren't a separate item, they're a skin for the existing stairs.
---
[NukaCryptPriceChecker](https://roguetrader.com/#/)
---
Use this. It will give you pretty good estimates and you won’t need to ask for price checks on future items or rely on a single person’s opinion to know whether or not you’re getting a good deal. It’s made my gameplay so much easier!
---
Correct about crafting the gauntlet. You should be fine to get a swing speed while crafting but if you were to get it for example as the reward for completing a colossal problem or scorched earth it would be limited to limb damage.
---
Fuuuuuuck. I just want a non-classical option.
---
Yeah, I love how it looks. They should give us a new scrap box.
---
wanna see a magic trick?
---
No problem. Glad to help.
---
I dont remember seeing them on the list when I bought it but I didn't know it was a skin either. Ill check tonight, thanks
---
Things all follow different clocks in the game. You can’t blame people for it
---
Become a water farmer or kill super muties / mole miners and sell the weapons they drop.
---
One uranium fever usually zeros my daily cap limit.
---
Congratulations on being the world's most efficient FO76 player. However your gaming prowess doesn't invalidate my point which is that it's supposed to be a GAME not a JOB. My suggestions are intended to balance the challenges to make it fairer for both casual players and fanatics alike and make the overall game experience be more enjoyable and less like a trip to the dentist. I feel like you think I'm attacking the game or something...I'm not for the most part its a fairly enjoyable game I'm just making a few suggestions based off my own personal experiences.
---
I've noticed with the SBQ if there are alot of other players it can take alot longer than with a small group of high levels or even solo.  I can solo her but if there's a big group of players and most of them don't pull their weight suddenly the fight takes a long time or can even time out.
---
I *think* the hp for bosses in these events is inflated when there are more players.  Just a theory
---
Yes, with emergency protocols you are pretty much invinsible if you dont completely ignore your health bar. I only use emergency protocols with my heavy gunner and im more tanky now than when i was full health. You loose the unyielding perks tho and its a pretty big hit to inteligence.
---
Not when the damn game auto completes the score challenges and you do not progress. Total fucking shit garbage game.
---
That's why I grabbed it to be honest: to see if it would function differently than the regular Juke n' Jive.
---
I like the music it plays well enough, but I wouldn't've minded more variety.
---
Well that makes two weeks in a row of getting to keep all my atoms
---
Just means you can save for something else.
---
By virtue of there being almost nothing new, I'd agree.
---
Not bad if you missed out on past bundles though.
---
yeah it helps boost durability. 
---
I always pop a mentats before crafting gear.
---
Legendary perks will help a bit.  I'm not too concerned with super power leveling though.
---
Also, cheaters, can you figure out a way to just kill me in the lobby? Tired of waiting. Thanks!
---
That doesn't apply to anything before fallout 4
---
I bought the bundle when it was first released and the stairs were definitely a part of it.
---
Base is easily rebuildt. 
---
Trolls are cowards
---
Then hopefully you have the clarity to know how a young Roblox player who seized the controller while mom/dad takes a shit will act online
---
Don't use dumbsss ESRB rating to justify OP being a brainlet, because ESRB disclaimer always says "interactions may change online"
---
It's pretty sharp, though it's a little big than the usual bench I use.  
---
I'm hoping the other crafting stations'll get similar treatment.
---
Official Mod support is coming to consoles and PC, although we don't know when or in what form.
---
...ehm, if you're not going to use that big pile of atoms, do you mind if I...
---
on a serious note, thanks for the weekly update. Jukebox looks nice, T65 camo isnt bad either.
---
You guys do realize no one is making you log in every day and all the rewards but a handful are strictly cosmetic
---
It just works....
---
I love that area. Check it it daily just cause. Gotten some good legendaries of all kinds there.  Fog crawlers, gulpers, super mutants, sheepsquatch many times. Fun to watch them go at it sometimes.
---
Both awesome, 50 cal slightly better for ammo consumption, you will want to tear your hair out with an lmg 🤣
---
Two nukes are better than one
---
Toss'em off a Feedback note saying that. Maybe in time, they'll do an update.
---
I'll note, it does actually specify "Classical" so maybe in the long run the other stations won't be too far behind.
---
u/ladydevann Sorry for paging you once again, but once again the reward for the event is not in the shop.
---
I was playing pretty regularly when the Legendary Run started, and on the whole, I was really enjoying it.  I liked the awards per level and it gave me another reason to jump in and play, but lately I haven't had time, and I'm just not online enough to make the kind of progress needed to complete it.  I wish they'd just offer a way for you to buyout on the rest of the run; just give me an Atoms amount I'd have to spend to complete the rest of it, *rather than just one level at a time*, and if I feel like buying out I'll do it.  At least give us the option.  Hell, if Fortnite can do that, surely FO76 can.  
---
I know that sounds like a cop-out or something only "whales" would do, but hey, not all of us have multiple hours a day to play, and if the only way we can get those items and skins is by progression, why not let us have the option?  How I spend atoms doesn't affect anyone else in game, so it'd be pretty weird for someone to have a problem with players doing that.  
---
I know people will piss and moan, saying "If you do that, Bethesda will know they can get away with more of that nickel-and-dime shit".  Look, Bethesda's going to do whatever the bloody hell it wants whether we like it or not.  Anyone still operating on the idea that "voting with your wallet" or whatever makes any difference is just deluding themselves.  Also: once again, what I do with my money is of no concern to anyone else.  I'm not taking it out of your pockets, so you have no reason to worry about it.  You do you, and I'll do me.  Simple as; end of.
---
If nothing else, Bethesda could choose not to unlock the buyout option until, say, level 30 or something, so players have to at least try to earn progression rewards via gameplay for a little while without just buying out the whole thing.  That, or they could just increase the amounts given upon task completion across the board to reduce the amount of grind.
---
Where does it state that it's going to be double score? Have they said this anywhere?
---
This isn’t true yet, I can verify magic shotguns still work in the PTS.
---
Where is a photo?
---

Very disappointing week.
---
The jukebox is cool but not 500 Atoms cool.  The satellite dish was nice to see return so I picked it up.  As for the rest - just why?
---
Also I feel like the Fallout 1st rewards get more lackluster with each month.  The workbench skin is cool I guess but that’s all?  Why not release similar skins for all workbenches rather than just the one?
---
It's the same as the regular Jukebox. It's just a nicer, cleaner skin.
---
Yeah changing the range boosting perk card to 300% for rifleman only type guns would help a lot to balance them.
---
Why no alien plushie 😭😭😭
---
I don't understand what your saying. You thought if you stayed in the world where your camp couldn't be placed it would disassemble and store everything?
---
The steel Dawn Army Fatigues will be available tomorrow. [Link here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/aziPqMpE2SiBmqWPiAxUb/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-1-8) :)
---
thx guys
---
That is it one hundred percent and when you put the blocking armor that's when the bar stops rubber banding something about that blocking armor
---
I keep hoping we'll get one from the Sons of Dane compound, or any of the non-standard ones from around the world. I will definitely send in a feedback note though, that's good thinking.
---
I’m pretty sure I already know but the new junkbox play any new music??
---
Man this is fucking ridiculous just had Earle glitch the fuck out into the ceiling and then he just disappears with like 10% HP and go to check the dailies and all but one daily and one weekly challenge are left. 
---
DA FUQ?!?!
---
Thanks for posting, damn this week is depressing..

When i saw cost of producing 308 bullets i was crying near my stash))
---
Which one is better?  They are different.  Lmg has a higher base damage but lower DPS. If you want to see which one is better you need to test them yourself without adrenaline
---
Bloodied should be one-shotting West Tek mutants with a fully charged Gauss headshot even without a bloodied weapon. That guy's probably running a poorly optimized build.
---
Thanks for clearing this up.
---
Praying for log bundle to return soon. I want my log cabin, sad I missed out on it twice now
---
the game itself has a clock. challenges, atom shop updates, limited time events... they all follow the same clock and have since Day 1.
---
Yup.  
---
I gifted a level 25 a TSE western revolver a couple days ago.  
---
Got far more satisfaction out of that than killing the SBQ... Again.
---
Literally 🤣 save it for special occasions and use a 50 cal or Gatling gun as your main, that’s what I do
---
Oof gotta log off at reset
---
Its on PC too  
---
NOICE
---
There's a gift emote. Seems to be effective.
---
so it's a basic heavy gunner build, except with a flamer? they break awfully fast just so you know, even non-legacy ones. definitely invest in gunsmith.
---
with vampire's/a full health build you're probably fine using regular armor. but I'd still recommend PA, even if only for bosses. your damage will suffer considerably without armor penetration.
---
Ah ! You forgot to log off before the reset my man ! Personnally i use an alarm clock. I highly recommand you that bro ! 
---
Sad for you dude, i'd be pissed !
---
As a Sons of Dane reward, that would actually be pretty cool.
---
Unique rewards like that would make such events more enticing.
---
It's normally what I do when I have an idea about something they can improve.
---
Can't guarantee it's ever worked, but it still seems more likely than just posting things here.
---
How much does it repair?
---
Cooling unit. Aka The Fridge.
---
Well now I gotta log on and finish it.. the hard part
---
Well you have to prime it. And it is a lot better. For maybe 50% more material you get around 200 bullets instead of like 28 or whatever
---
Best find was max lvl J25 +1 A handmade for like 4 K( currently using this weapon).  best deal medics 25/15fr handmade for 323 caps sold it for 200 crimson flux.
---
I got my eye on--- *floater scream and flames*
---
Im rookie in world of heavy guns))
---
Usually at events. Encryptid, Radiation Rumble, Meat Week, etc.  
---
Saw the highest levels I've ever seen at this past Meat Week, actually. 697.
---
I like the default classical station, but HATE the normal jukebox. Does it play the radio or the normal jukebox stuff
---
Thank you 👍🏼 Through blood, sweat and tears, I’ve made it to tier 98! Plenty of time left... 🤞🏻
---
It's up right now. Everything Daily, Weekly, and Repeatable is double.
---
"crank up the tunes" next to a pic of a guy doing air guitar and i mean...it's the same classical music as the regular one. a possible contender for one of the most misleading atom store item promos yet. imagine going to the trouble of sprucing up what looks like the fallout 3 vault jukebox and not switching the music tracks over.
---
It's a community event to get us ready for when the Brotherhood return,  we unlock rewards for each tier completed, it's meant to be a bit of fun and busy work but ppl will be ppl and expect the moon and stars for donating crap they have literally picked up from the floor!
---
Explain how you get 1k damage off a pipe revolver
---
I already don't know where to spend all the caps.
---
Yes! And u can play it on ps5 too wich will have better graphical capability too so that's amazing
---
Where did you get the plan?  
---
I've been looking all over for it and didn't want to resort to googling it.
---
Aw thank you! I live in SoCal, so it’s hard not to fall in love with Griffith Park/Observatory
---
It’s been like 8 weeks now just remember to log off before 12 eastern and this won’t be a problem
---
they need to let us sell them. They're so annoying (and heavy)
---
Been of the opinion that there should be an additional rare reward drop pool that should rotate randomly per day between all potential loot pools. 
---
To ensure that no one item on said can be farmed knowingly beyond just doing alot of activities daily,  especially as a means to introduce new non atom camp items.
---
I don't know if there's a direct email.  
---
I just tend to contact them through the Support site and I've had moderate success so far.  
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
That too could have to do with framerates and magic weapons. Once the ads show up and there is more action, the framerates can drop and make it more difficult for magic weapons to do their thing.
---
I could see how that might be a problem. Out of my 5 characters, only 2 of them are stationary, I built my other camps as sort of modular buildings I could just move around whenever I got sick of being in one spot. I got to where I just prefer being able to move around at will. 
---
I'll set down in a place, and learn all of the resources available in the area, it's been very beneficial to finding places I can quickly get lead, aluminum, iron, etc without having to spend too much time scouring the map. 
---
I moved one of my guys over the weekend, mostly to what I thought was just a cool spot near Huntersville, but it's wound up being the holy grail I've been looking for because there's aluminum, lead, iron, and water all within a short walk from my campsite, plus it's secluded and near places where legendaries spawn.
---
My stationary camps, one on the pillar near Skullbone Vantage and the other on the archway near Toxic Larry's will probably never be moved, because they were a bit of a pain to build - but I like moving my camp around, especially when I can move someplace and deploy my artillery, like behind Westek and start shelling the super mutants:)
---
it may have been tamable but you need to use animal friend rank 3 not wasteland wisperer
---
Yep gonna grab that immediately.
---
Was in the middle of converting to a Junkies build from Bloody in anticipation for One Wasteland, got a guy selling a 3* Junkies Handmade and a 3* Junkies Lever Action, both for 1200. Easiest 2400 ever spent.
---
“The power armor skin includes a plan for the Secret Service Jetpack Mod”
---
What exactly does this mean? On the camo secret service power armor skin.
---
consolation: inert flux is drinkable, and weighs less than purified water....
---
50 cal
---
Both jukeboxes exclusively play their own classical thing
---
Okay. Yeah for lmg always use prime receiver. Makes ammo making much easier. Honestly just use them both. Fastfire lmg you are going to be reloading a lot. The only hold 75 bullet anyway. There is a perk for faster reloading but that's perk points.
---
I use bloodied rifles on the queen so magic is not a factor
---
Congrats to you too! That’s awesome, I can’t wait to reach level 100 myself. Haha, right?? I have an alt character whose main focus is moving all over the map, so I’m sure I’ll make use of that secret door eventually 👀
---
Why does Bethesda Not tell us this or take the fucking server down? Fucking bullshit.
---
I like it!
---
Now to go back and find all the people spreading lies about it lasting 76 days or 11 weeks...
---
Wasn’t the alien plushie available like two days ago?
---
Not only boredom, but I'll honestly never use legendary pistols. (Maybe not never, but very likely not) so gifting them out when I'm already at max scrip feels like a useful thing to do with them, instead of just hoarding them.
---
Dang... I’ll have to look into it then
---
“Thirsty? Try a refreshing Nuka-Cola Wild at Doc Phosphate’s Saloon!”
---
The one time I genuinely laugh on Reddit. It's here.
---
My main idea to take such heavy for SBQ &amp; Earl events only. Im bloody commando, but as always man wants to try something new
---
Or the people spreading lies that it was impossible to finish without spending atoms lol.
---
Oh yes that's annoying as hell, but imo the most annoying thing today is trying 5 times to fast travel before it actually works.
---
It’s in the Atom Shop files, not the score ones
---
What about theperksyou would need just for general PA upkeep/requirements?
---
I don't know which is more gross; This fact or your username?
---
I've learned from experience that this does not help.
---
Probably using adrenal reaction along with the pistol and riflemen perk cards.
---
How in the fuck am I suppose to know that?
---
Well that's a bummer, I hate that classical music. So it's a no from me dawg
---
Yeah man it’s really frustrating. It makes the 25% less vats cost useless in a way
---
😂 I can’t wait to actually play Fallout again
---
I get that the blame for the issue is on Bethesda. 
---
However after the amount of weeks this has been as issue I’m surprised this is still posted daily.
---
On today best reloading perk is Trial fireworks) thx bethesda👍🏻✌🏻
---
I'm fairly new, not seen this before - is it a "playable" instrument that gives you "well tuned"?
---
It only affected me when I was logged on
---
TBF it takes both rifleman and gunslinger perks so that may be a bug lol. 
---
Max out those. Max out stealth perks. Vats, headshots, adrenaline. You may have a few shots drop below but if you do it right you can fly through west tek and other areas.
---
Last update on it was before the score system came out
---
Legendary run ends on the eighth...Not like it’ll help anybody get those lost score points back
---
I’d like to debate it because I just got a 2* boxing glove.
---
I seriously just go through side door because it just annoys me. I also hope they fix. That was actually first atomic shop camp thing I bought and now I’ve been buying more bundles. I used to just have a couple walls and whatever I needed for atom challenges for the longest time. But now I take more pride in my camp so I have been buying more stuff. But this garage door sucks. I also bought the bunker which also has a door problem.
---
Okay. At this time the sbq is not affected by explosive weapons.  But still, if you are bloodied then just get addicted and use the junkies 50 cal.
---
Yeah, just a basic heavy build. I have one in luck of the draw for the breakage. And an acid node base for the expensive ammo. 
---
I appreciate the input. I wpuldnt really need to spec into PA for boss fights as they dont last that long. So that is good advice.
---
Yeah sounds nice :D I wanna play so bad but gotta wait for my money to come in
---
Love the VT armor bench! Keep the VT crafting benches coming.
---
Ahhhhhh makes much more sense
---
Same here. 5 weekly and 5 daily already completed
---
Im Bloody Junkie😂🤪
---
Usually SSQ, but - I’ve gotten queen mireluck and the only scorched mega sloth I’ve ever seen....
---
As for ”regular critters” usually either supermutants or scorched.
---
Had no idea until I saw this post and it’s been in my camp for almost a week! Thanks
---
Been asking for this hope they fix it
---
yeap.
---
Pistol perks and rifleman perks, sneak multiplier, maybe drugs too. I ran around with one for a while but it was a quad.
---
Why can't they ever do free shit on the weekend when I'm actually home?
---
Question answered. Just stick with the junkies 50 cal. And Prime that s*** to for the extra damage
---
This is not a solution. I was on all weekend during the reset and did not have auto complete. But 3 days ago I logged in first time during the evening and had auto complete.  There is no rhyme or reason to the bug
---
What ever happened to that black t-65 armor paint ?
---
Fellow ocd grumpy old man agrees
---
Does anyone know how much the contemporary bundle is?
---
Thanks Ill try that now , bit odd that there's no email 🤔
---
I don’t know but I still want it 😭😭😭
---
It’s nice though. Super easy to repair and just a fun gun compared to everyone with their bloodied commandos.
---
*sigh*...
---
Unzips...
---
Not magic, more that shotguns do jackall outside of VATS.
---
I would like more regular ants so I can make and sell more of the wastelands best craft beer lager, Rad Ant Lager.
---
u/MidRoad An Energy reduction backpack should be called the "**Battery Pack**" :D
---
Interesting I didn’t know it was happening before Tuesday’s around 12 eastern! That sucks man I’m sorry
---
Ya it sucks wish I would have know before i got it I hate the classical in this game also wish we had more tunes on the good station
---
If they could increase the drop rate just a little too, im level 400 and im grinding like a mad man and I still can't get any of the rare drops to drop.
---
So a weird thing is that you don't seem to be able to add it with the physical mod only if you actually know the plans to craft your own x01 jet pack and have all materials.
---
 okay maybe not exactly like you do. I only carry at most 50 but usually it's between 25 to 30
---

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
At max rank it can keep guns from ever breaking, if you are lucky
---
I’m a little bummed that I missed out on the BOS beret and banner.  I donated materials, but I didn’t realize they’d be on the Atom Shop so I didn’t check as I wasn’t feeling well.
---
Wish I’d kept an eye on this sub.  Always a great source of information.  I should’ve known better.
---
To add to this the bos plans at grafton are no more than 500 caps for all 3 plans. I bought them all this morning and was surprised how cheap they were compared to vendor camp plans.
---
when do these come out?
---
Its a ticket system it works.
---
Lol yup
---
Thanks for taking one for the team.
---
Didn't know about that site, that's pretty cool!
---
you don't really need to spec for PA specifically. you'll probably want batteries included since flamer fuel weighs a ton, and it works for fusion cores as well. just put 3 more points in int for stabilized and you're good to go.
---
personally I think gunsmith is better than luck of the draw because it never triggers for me. with level 5 gunsmith your flamer should last long enough.
---
Yep, I sell that too on the rare occasion I actually find ant meat. They are a very underused enemy so far. I only ever see them at the Tea Time event.
---
You can only equip 6...
---
Technically you didn’t need to spend atoms (I didn’t and finished last week) BUT will they keep doing the extra daily challenges like this season?  Without those I don’t know if I would’ve finished yet or not.
---
Since I know the plans to make them I put the Treasure Hunter Outfit &amp; Hat, and Insurgent Outfit &amp; Hat in my shop for 500 each, and Marine Helmets for 750 each, they sell like hot cakes. 
---
(I hope the Deathclaw Hunter outfit and hat from the upcoming treasure hunter event are also plans.)
---
Worked better when it bugged working with healing factor/speed demon mutations and max life giver.
---
Because it's not guaranteed to work.
---
The regular jet pack mod is added to the PA. I can add any other jet pack skin to it besides the communism one. None of the requirements are greyed out, just the skin itself.
---
Yeah ik I had to find out here awhile ago. Super frustrating Bethesda doesn’t at least let us know helpful ways to avoid this
---
Is it so much to ask for a weapon skin for weapons that people actually use and not shit like the alien blaster?
---
I sell the all the grenades and throw the floater ones off a cliff.
---
“Three months for bug fixing.”
---
You just gave me Operation Health flashbacks, Nam-style.
---
But in all seriousness, fast travel bug is number 1. Then, because I do a lot of building, the glitch wear the item outline is green but you get the ‘Needs Support’ glitch. 95% VATS hits missing (I’m a Commando so this could total up to 10 wasted bullets per 1 second missed shots). A customizable hud/Pip-boy menu, like every other MMO. There’s more, but thats all I can think of now.
---
Really amazes me how every object in your inventory is somehow kept track of by the system as if it were a real item needing to be fully rendered. 
---
I have so much lag when having to go through my appearal list.
---
Stuff like the proposed idea above should be baseline for all camp items and inventory. They shouldn't be capable of lagging the system so bad.
---
I hear too that it also plays a big part in why some world textures take so long to load. That your visual experience of the game is reduced due to packed inventories.
---
It definitely gave me direction for my day. Now I'm trying to finish off all the atom challenges that I have unfinished. Like this week I worked on scrapping 76 hats lol
---
"it just works"
---
We desperately need skins for the other heavies too.
---
Because it's been happing since the start and somebody still seems to need to be told every week.
---
Under the pylon, next to Sunnytop Station. Flat ground, centralish location, near ACP so good footfall. I've been making a fortune selling 'magic' guns, 5mm and fusion cores this past week.
---
Fallout Detroit. Pls Beth just let me fix up a Corvega factory and customize my own vehicle!
---
it's coming with patch 22 I think. it's coming either way.
---
Yeah.
---
What door problem on bunker? I dont have any issues
---
nope. points are gone forever.
---
Nothing you can do unfortunately.
---
All this Responders stuff and they still haven’t brought back the responders pip boy skin or the gurney beds ),: I want them so bad!
---
Does it have different music from the OG one?
---
Nothing good, no pack
---
Agreed. A Colossal Problem is a step in the right direction too
---
It is kind of a bummer there isn’t just different musical variants of them like FO4. My only workaround has just been merging the radio inside the jukebox🤷‍♂️
---
hopefully you're not trying to get SCORE points back, because that ain't happening.
---
It's an online game you cant mod it
---
VATS I think. Brought a stalker 33% vats gauss, mod it and head to the test, it was a robobrain that's 5 meters away, we are both not moving, all 7 or 8 shots of 95% VATS went perfectly to the 10cm above it's head(all same spot), can't even got mad because it was so bad
---
This grumpy dude agrees
---
great comment, dunno why it got downvoted. here, it‘s red again. &lt;3
---
some people said to open a ticket asking for compensation in the form of atoms, so you can buy the levels instead.
---
Welp I tried
---
Make that 3.
---
Yes. Like I said for some reason with this particular skin it isn't working on physical mods unless you have the plan also unlocked. I assume it's just a checkbox on the physical mod that wasn't checked but I haven't had a chance to check it in the datamines. 
---
If you buy the plan and learn it, it should let you apply the skin but it might actually require you to remove current jet pack and craft a new jetpack again - haven't determined that.
---
Well short of a game engine rebuild by competent devs, unlike the B-team in Austin taking FO4 and layering multi player on it, buggy is pretty much unavoidable and nothing would ever get released.
---
coming soon. all weapons will be rendered useless and the sky is falling!
---
At least your blooded explosive lever didn’t unlike me.
---
Only time I give then some slack on ammo prices (still wont buy) or other prices is when I see most if not everything in their vendor is set at default or they are lower level.
---
Not everyone who plays follows the market or community some are casual just having fun. Just ignore the prices and hop to the next vendor.
---
Oh god YES. Tell me more ... slowly.
---
Oh hey, the Camo Paint is finally here for the T-65
---
Guess that solves that mystery
---
One shot everything.
---
Seriously? They’re selling the camo paint JUST for T-65 instead of including it with the old camo bundle? Bullshit.
---
It works fine just have the sound up and watch it open. The doors sound is for a garage door and the sound keeps playing when door isn’t moving. I could care less if they fix this but I do want the red rocket door fixed
---
A friend of mine uses these alot, he always used 3 of them at his camp at once to lengthen their attack length.  
---
But just yesterday his train camp got wrecked and the game refused to let him repair all 3 artillery anymore. 
---
He wound up having to scrape them and realized that the in game limit of 3 had been reduced to 1.
---
Which disappointed him greatly as his camp is positioned to be able to use them in the mire at all times.
---
God damnit I was really excited for the jukebox too
---
Actually that part was true before the 2x score weeks, the extra score week, and the 2 extra dailies every day
---
5.56 sells all day for 2, so does ec
---
Reading this thread, I'm surprised at how many people use weight management perks. I've never used any of them, and have never really had an issue with weight. I generally stop back at my camp and scrap/dump stuff after every event.
---
if that was possible, it would be mentioned a LOT more on this subreddit.
---
I hate that so much.
---
That is awesome, instant-buy for me, thanks!
---
Same exact thing for me. I agree it's just random and luckly it only happened once before I completed the run, but I have noticed its 3 times after could've been more i stopped paying attention after i completed) and never once did it happen when I was on at reset
---
Even without VPN they can revert the dynamic IP to another one with a properly made call to their ISP. If they want to/know how to cheat only solution is to make the cheat itself not work anymore
---
you will not get those points back, I am sorry.
---
Agreed - some LMG and Gat Plasma skins would rock
---
Sorry, misunderstood your first reply :)
---
I bought the plan for the mod and learned it before I crafted the jet pack (quite difficult to make it without). 
---
It’s odd some have problems, and other people don’t.
---
I think someone mentioned it yesterday and a couple people reported they got their atoms.
---
worth a try either way.
---
Just bought it. Nope. Same classical music.
---
Thought as much. Of all weeks this could happen too.
---
Who knows but I assume so. It's pretty common in games with battle passes to have these events.
---
Always roll 3\* armor, the 3rd \* is the best.
---
Roll 2\* weapon (melee or ranged) until you get one that's what you want, then roll 3\*
---
Skip the "mystery pick" sale when it's available unless you need melee, ranged AND armor or like trading them.
---
👍🏻👌🏻
---
just remove door, voila always open and you get a tiny little sliver of budget to play with
---
I just want those stairs, but it looks like you have to buy the full package - RIP.
---
So few and far between most people dont notice even if they are in a match with a cheater
---
Hopefully they fix hdr for that!
---
It includes a camo jetpack I assume
---
I see you found our auto complete feature.  Please enjoy playing the game doing something else now.
---
So glad I finished my Legendary Run Monday night before this update
---
Oh, what a disappointment...Thanks for the info anyways man :)
---
You trade it or sell it
---
I haven't donated anything tbh, I picked that crap off the floor fair and square and you bet your ass I'm not gonna hand it over to some brotherhood fan boy
---
Like the old one, on by default. Which radio does it play classical or appalachia radio ?
---
I bought it... It's not showing.  
---
And yes, i know it should be showing in the "Stash" section with the other safes.  
---
There is no option to scroll right or left and even after putting down all safe and storing them,  
---
it still doesn't show up.   
---
To those who think the Build menu is a mess... Well, it always been like this.
---
Bethesda has no fucking clue on how to organize stuff.
---
3 more levels to go....
---
Just glad to see Zorbo sucking my dust.
---
Thank you. Went 97 levels without an issue, online at reset some days and off on others. Then boom, all of a sudden I had it three days in a row. Took me forever to knock out those last three. It’s not just people who are on or off at reset, it’s a deeper issue that they need to figure out before season two.
---
Nope, it's just a reskin.
---
Which really sucks because it looks like a Classic 1950's Jukebox you'd find in a diner. It would've been worth the price if it could actually **PLAY** the music from that era. It's part of what makes Fallout so memorable.
---
no vertibird power armor
---
why even live
---
Speaking on behalf of OP, yes. I thought that at first too. It makes it seem like you can move your CAMP and therefore it's no longer in that spot
---
And this is why the perk card system is beyond stupid for legendary cards.
---
Do we know if the new season starts September 8th aswell? Or do we have to wait for the next update ?
---
Played one the other day where it was going great we had him down to less than half a bar and then he started gliching to the ceiling and then just before we killed him he disappeared. Right after that the announcement that another nuke was dropping came and we all just stood around??????
---
Rip
---
Ultracite 2mm EC ammo as well. 
---

If you're bloodied it's stabilized and emergency protocols vs unyielding armor. Both have benefits depending on situation and weapon. 
---
If you're not bloodied, power armor wins. You need stabilized and emergency protocols is still helpful otherwise you can use some of the others mods that improve STR or AP. 
---
Also, some of the heavy weapons are difficult to control out of power armor without stabilized. I use a Gatling Gun and 50cal all the time out of power armor, but if I want to use something like a Gatling plasma or minigun, getting in power armor is a necessity.
---
I just want to be able to use lesser cores first for weapons like how the Power Armor does.
---
Great find!!! Theres a static spawn for Cranberry and Wild in the busted train 100 ft north of WSS, but yours is way better man. Thank you for this!
---
I think we can all agree with this
---
Indeed! I forgot to add that thank you!
---
Your not punished, you chose to keep changing your build, thats on you not them.
---
That's just sad, thanks for the info man :)
---
I got excited when I saw the title then I realized it was the location I've had as my custom map marker since my first week playing.
---
Some people have someone else add the jetpack and trade the torso piece or have the physical mod attachment. 
---
As for the issues, yes it's odd. 
---
I'd contact support, they might not be able to fix the problem but if not at least you might be able to get some atoms back.
---
When you start your day put two suits of power armor down you should be able to put a core in the suit you want.
---
Or even better, how about an ally that follows you, increasing your carrying capacity.
---
So what ammo do you get if you use melee? Is it random or what you used previously?
---
I agree, vats isn’t helping if the damage isn’t even applying to the enemies. I hope this gets a fix in the next update
---
Where’s my melee skins at? 
---
Some of us out here use stuff other than the super sledge/Grognaks axe...
---
Still waiting on decent outfits or something, surprised the mining outfit set isn't out either now ACP is for everyone..
---
Recent outfits are just meh, need more serious wasteland-ish ones.
---
Hmmm thx for correcting me
---
This was my first experience, almost uninstalled. 
---
It's because someone was using an automatic telsa rifle.
---
Same ...
---
Considering how inventory items are tracked and the amount of lag they can cause, might more so be an elaborate attempt to make the servers more stable.
---
Id like a mutated mule named Sal.
---
I was 2 days of bullions away from using the glitch.
---
I kinda think they’re gonna have the different ones swapped out through the week? Like they have been with the plushies, it makes sense. Not certain, but I’d be surprised if they didn’t
---
And you don't get 42% damage reduction before factoring in damage threshold, practical rad immunity, and a flat buff to your Strength if you opt for that.
---
Right? Is it the Jetpack for the ss jetpack or t65 Jetpack?
---
I miss having quests. Lol
---
There was some one using a tesla, now you mention it. They seriously need to get better servers.
---
Melee from my experience seems to drop only a handful of either radaway, stimpacks, or purified water.
---
Lol.. that would be awesome.
---
It's very sad that you don't enjoy classical.
---
Ahh, forgot about how much legendary mods can change things.  I’ve only found 1 legendary enemies so far.  I imagine I’ll find more as I level up, right?
---
Same tried with enforcer didn't seem to work.
---
This is where my one friend set his camp.  I raid that machine every chance I get.
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll definitely help out
---
I think we'll find out in ITV on Thursday. Doubtful though, the new season will come with the next patch which I can't see being next week. Think there'll be a couple weeks downtime between.
---
If it's atoms its probably not classical as that is an in game plan
---
you must have one of the two permanent quest items in your misc tab. check if you got a Osmosis Kit or a Portable Power Pack on you.
---
You realize you get 500 atoms for completing the run, right? That's 3 levels x 150 atoms a level which is 450 atoms to finish those 3 levels.
---
You're still net positive 50 atoms if you buy the last 3...
---
Imagine all the bugs. All the weird thing that are about to happen. Tons of new super OP broken stuff. Interesting times.
---
Think nothing of it.
---
I'm just trying to make sure other people don't spend their well-earned Atoms on something that's not what they think it is.
---
Fallout 1st rewards are starting to feel like unwanted leftovers. Would love for there to be options to chose from.
---
When i come across a lowbie player I usually craft them some new clothes with a custom assaultron/robot helmet to make them look blinging, i also offer for them to go to my camp and loot all my open nodes/farm/purifiers/raiderammo colector/etc.
---
Usually makes them happy. They also end up buying a lot of my cheap 10 caps plans coincidentally &gt;:D.
---
1.200
---
So far the three best places for cloth I know of are the Summerville scientist house nearby when you spawn in, about 300 cloth in burnt books. Tyler County Fairground, all the paper cups hotdog trays and pizza dishes are all worth cloth, and Collision Course gives 100 Pre War Money every time too. Looking for even more cloth farming spots if anybody has any other good spots. 
---
(Saved up 14k cloth to donate, but I wanna get even more before I lug 500+ pounds of cloth from whitesprings station to the observatory.)
---
It was available last week for 24 hours.
---
Ugh, is this on console? I haven't had any framerate issues on PC... just issues with people joining then not even going into the mine for the fight. Last night I think it was only the guy who launched the nuke and me who joined the fight despite another three or four guys hanging around. Luckily my magic minigun hasn't been fixed yet.
---
Gotcha thanks.  Seems bloodied weapons make you a bit of a glass canon.  Seems a lot
---
Of the legendary mods and mutations can be real game changers.
---
Might have been playing an elaborate game where he would have returned something 100 times the value to the forst person who did.
---
That or just doesn't understand etiquette and protocol in the slightest.
---
What does the jukebox do?
---
Oh wow.  How’d you get it to 466?
---
Not all ammo is the same...for instance, ultracite cost more than regular to craft so deserves a higher price. As far as the plans go...all i can say is its a free market.
---
Does it autoplay even if you switch it off, after fast traveling to your camp from another location?
---
Bullshit. I just tested it with a stock, non-legendary Gauss Rifle on lvl 68 supermutants. Even at max range, it STILL one-shots supermutants without issue. I think your build is probably just garbage.
---
that prisitine Vault-Tec Armor Workbench is something that my second account might actually get 1 month of subscription in October. I really like the looks of it.
---
I wish the jukeboxes would just get the same playlist as the jukebox in the Nuclear Winter lobby. Whenever I load into vault 51 I just run to that jukebox and listen to its muzak while I wait for the match to start.
---
You would think that since this has been known for weeks now... that you would log off at 11:55am and back in an 12:05pm....
---
No joke in 25 years of gaming it was the laggiest, most frustrating thing I've ever encountered. 
---
Been waiting like 6 months for new content and that was my first experience with it gg Bethesda.
---
You know theres a stash box there.
---
The one from the blood eagles set?
---
Yes, and nuka-cola quantum gives my jet pack wings. Someday my ap will glitch and I will fly to skyrim.
---
Yeah on my Xbox one x it's been getting really bad for months I played another game other day it was buttery smooth. They need better severs.
---
Cool. I messaged you on Xbox, just message back when you’re ready to receive some diffusers
---
It is a little outrageous sometimes and normally it’s the newer players that fall for it. I always try and under sell plans below the default price or if I come across a new player I just drop some plans for them randomly have.
---
Good job man, that's really nice of you
---
Finally got the contemporary house bundle, could not be happier!
---
I'm already on my seasonal break, and have been for ten days now. Without challenges, I don't have a real incentive to play. Meat week was a nice distraction, but the Earle event is not for me. So, yesterday was the first day since B.E.T.A. that I didn't even log in, and I don't have a reason to do so today, either.
---
The last time I **did** log in, my in-game friends list had only two active players, down from normally 15 to 20, so I'm fairly sure I can't be the only one.
---
Keep us bored, and you'll lose us as active players.
---
Note to self, gotta get better at tagging the scrubs. Most of my 2mm is going straight into Earle. In three runs, I’ve had a net loss of 8,000 rounds. That’s the real colossal problem.
---
50% off on the untarnished paint for a bugged weapon that's confirmed to be useless not only outside the forest, but now on the whole map at any level, once one wasteland comes!
---
and they are  mostly things that just need to be finished! OP you are a busy man
---
Confirmed it is the same as the one in game.... No interest at all...
---
Yeah I think so too.
---
Boo...
---
They really need to hook one up wit different tunes.
---
Or allow us to change what they play.
---
I usually reward low levels I encounter in content way over their head that they stick with. 
---
Once got a duel drop of the SBQ and Earl and when mr and my bud bested the Queen we fast traveled to a peep we say in the map in the mine.
---
Turned out he was level 13, and was totally alone down there. We showed up, 2 manned it. Then proceed to hook him up with power armor,  weapons, stims, ammo, food, and walked him through some 8 more levels so he could use every thing we gave him.
---
C'mon dude, he must be relatively new. And it even happened to me a couple of days ago ( not on my weeklies tho ), even with over 1500 hours of experience. I got back on the game, 2 weeks ago, after 2 months away, i though this shit had been fixed bro.
---
Take my upvote!
---
A big mole rat named Bert, packed like a trade brahmin.
---
Now it's not a secret!
---
It plays the same music as the regular jukebox
---
The in game plan jukebox plays classical, I'm guessing one in the atom shop would play something else
---
Atom shop. It'll likely be available again in the future. It's part of the monster bundle that comes with a fedora and gold minigun paint
---
The problem is that they overloaded the STORE where you buy stuff with SETTINGS.... it's just such a weird design decision. You can only set your icon within the store, and your NW outfit from the store as well. It's just yet another annoying shortcut they took with the game.
---
Wait you get 5-6 different rewards from Encryptid? I only get a stupid hat. ;) Seriously though, good suggestion. I'd like to see them put some stuff in the rewards that's consumable that makes grinding worthwhile. For the queen, you get repair kits, for Earle you get screws. For Encryptid and Project Paradise you get a sense of pride and accomplishment. Why not have some boss fights drop bulk ammo scrap or gears or even lunchboxes. Hell Riding Shotgun is more lucrative than Project Paradise.
---
I imagine there was a direct email it would be flooded constantly with nonsense.
---
At these through the support site they can regulate some of it down.
---
Ye I know. But when it's every week
---
 Half the times it's the same people.
---
I see the gold rocket ride is available again.  Tempting, but generally I am pretty happy watching the Commander ride my red rocket.
---
on the PTS they only drop as clothing items, so far. i hope they change it to plans.
---
They're giving the alien blaster a 30% buff with the next update, they need to build up hype for it. Don't worry about the fact that even with a 30% buff it will no longer be viable anywhere on the map with one wasteland, or that the bugged delayed projectiles still haven't been fixed after almost 2 years, just buy the skin
---
How is that possible? Did they remove the plan?
---
Oh that would be so cool. Like those ammo belts around the torso, right?
---
Yup and never attach Wall Decor to the foundation, you will never be able to remove it, also you cant store/destroy this buggy mess
---
Doesn’t help me when the cloth is in my scrap box though unfortunately... I’d just put down my tent nearby but I have it parked at the whitesprings station, and the game gets very fussy when I try to put it back there... Last time I moved my tent from there it was a good three days before I was able to put it back.
---
(You’d think they’d put a scrap box at the observatory eh?)
---
I have lv 5 gunsmith as well as luck of the draw. It was just some advice i saw someone give on a flamer build post
---
I know it’s not on the high list of bugs atm, but I can’t seem to find the liberated liberator in the settlers base, I think he may be glitched for me. 
---
I just wanna take his picture :’(
---
I would also very much like to know this. It's weird if that's locked behind it...
---
I thought it might do. I removed the jukebox from my house, as it kept playing the same damn song over and over. Plus, it kept switching itself back on!
---
Yeah, raising the level increases durability, and some attachments decrease/increase max durability. But if you keep things the same, same level weapon with same attachments, the durability difference will be based on random chance and nothing more
---
And you can pull a draw string on the plushie and it roars
---
Make it so that the C.A.M.P. item is directional  so players dont always only spawn north of it.
---
Need so bad for players to spawn in front of my camp and not in the middle or back of it where they are left utterly confused as to what's going on with my silent hill experience camp.
---
Yup. Not all the time, but enough that I decided to just keep it out of my camp.
---
Ikr, i use the station at the top of map, train tracks lead right to it, and very minimal enimes
---
Same thing happened to me and my scout mask
---
Raider Punk loves that thing.
---
Yes sir. I'm only 2 weeks in level 28 but since my supplies have been coming in heavy I usually do equipment drops on the lowest characters around my camp I'm just down from wayward. I've given away so much unique items because I hate them taking up space and I don't like dropping them. I've earned a hefty amount from my vendors also.
---
Yea its lame, I wish we could get the jukebox that biv has at the tattoo parlor
---
At least we’re getting pump-action and handmade skins in the next season
---
Dreading logging back in because of this exact reason. Really hoping this is resolved for next season or they atleast give the player support the toolset to actually provide support for this.
---
exactly. people like to act as if someone is forcing them to do this. especially the caps aspect, put better stuff in your vendors and people will buy it, no need to clear vendor caps. 🙄
---
Well see for those that have time constraints they have the buy in option, and by large and far am I not the only efficient player.
---
The pickaxe and wiffle bat skin are right there buddy. 
---
-BGS
---
I agree with the ultracite for sure. But plasma cores are not worth 20 each lol
---
If it helps, Fallout has always been a mix of sci-fi and fantasy.
---
I've definitely found the faster the fire rate the worse it is for ammo return, because you end up spending more ammo on Earl.
---
Went in with my AA 50 cal and spent 3K ammo, barely got 500 back. Because the wendigos only dropped 30 or so rounds of 50 cal when they did drop it.
---
Went in last night with my Prime Vamp Gatling and left with around the same amount of ammo I went in with, because the wendigos drop 100+ ultracite 5mm ammo when they drop it. If you went in and only focused on the wendigos, you could come out with more of this ammo than you went in with.
---
Absolutely! Would be great to have a gatling laser one too
---
just ashame they put a atomshop item in the game that i have to keep turned off when its supposed to play music thats jazz
---
Finally those sweet satellite dishes are back
---
I just got *The VATS Unknown* yesterday, it looks like if I was to use an AB, that would be the one.
---
Might have to look into getting that TNT Storage key on this character.
---
Especially take the time to farm ammo and stims from the spawns if your making great time. 
---
Am so spent on lead and steal since this boss.
---
Not that it's a bad thing, but those weapons already have plenty of skins. Half of which are broken too, mainly the handmade ones. It would be nice to get a fully functional, thought out skin for a double barrel or .45 smg or LMG or something instead
---
Ah yes! The pickaxe skin. My sincerest apologies lord Todd, please spare my fragile mind as I throw righteous dollar bills your way. 
---
I just want an unarmed skin, or some neat one handed skins. Feels bad man...
---
I'm surprised people aren't selling these, too. I saw an insurgent outfit in a vendor for the first time this morning. I bought it cuz why not. It was only 499 and seemed fair since I've never seen one.
---
Thank you 👍🏻 also does it have to be vars?
---
I love putting mine at the whitesprings station since it’s basically like a little hub area. My house in Helvetia and my tent at whitesprings I can basically fast travel anywhere at a discount. (Plus having being able to fast travel for free to a vendor, scrap box, scrip machine, and one of the best farming areas is real handy. Level 68 charred ferals are good for testing out weapons. Ha ha)
---
Anyone facing an enemy behind cover.
---
Increased stash would be cool but you shouldn't have to dedicate a slot for it. That's not really fair.
---
Maybe a master craftsman perk that gives you the ability to repair 200pct without swapping cards.
---
Or why not a Master Caravaner that give you a pack brahmin that holds an extra 500?
---
One of the perks produces a chem that fills hunger/thirst bars, removes all diseases, and I think full heal as well
---
Maybe Bethesda will see this comment and give us a jazz jukebox.... or better yet,  a new music staton on the pip boy. Alas  I know in my heart that won't happen any time soon lol 😅😆
---
My character looks like a Deathclaw/man hybrid and a proper skin for the Deathclaw gauntlet would be amazing for him
---
So true, my camp is near the station so i can just run down the train tracks and im there, to poor for 1st rn so no tent :(
---
Most likely we will be seeing a clean skin for each workbench monthly for the next 6 months.
---
It doesn’t 😛
---
Not playing a ton right now but I'm leaving all my Dailies as complete as possible so when the next season starts I can just turn them all in for the XP.
---
At lvl 500 you'll max 2 cards at best,just saying. And I want to see you get to 500 in a few weekends. It's not as easy as levelling at peasant lvl 150.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap each. Except missiles, 40mm, mini nukes and plasma cores.
---
They go straight back onto the floor.
---
World of Warcraft could teach a lot of things to a lot of games. Even back in 2008 when I started playing.
---
honestly its up to you, decided to roll with heavy guns when I got past level 70 myself, this game is quite flexible with builds at early levels so just go with what you feel is right instead of focusing on end goal build
---
Who wants to get rid of some screws?3 _ 4 caps a piece?!pm me xbox plz!
---
Why are they selling an in game plan that's super common that everyone complains about lol
---
So it seems it's just for the T65 jetpack. Very misleading.
---
Couple weeks in between seems too close to October. I’d say it probably go live September 15th with the new patch.
---
Article said later today
---
Also more specific enemy type dungeons to use said in world be  nice.
---
Got it thanks to the weekly challenges!
---
Question my dude, when I put the jet pack on it can I remove the paint and keep the jetpack?
---
Sometimes Fog Crawlers too
---
That's true. It's kindof hard to properly explain what is the exact sweet spot - but I felt like some of the elements mentioned feel a bit off.
---
TSE the dragon for 700 caps
---
True.
---
Encryptid gives you the hat, the two outfits and the Fixer Plan
---
Plenty of space in the south for some more interesting things to do.
---
The fatigues were in the atom shop already? I got the other things free in the atom shop.check almost every day for free or cheap stuff
---
You can use it to make ammo to dump into the ammo converter, which does produce 2mm
---
How?  It's for the t 65 armor, it makes sense it would have a skin for stuff that goes with the armor.
---
Been wanting the rustic wood wallpaper to come back for awhile now :( may get the gold spaceship finally but another disappointing week
---
True, or you can grind it out and net 500 atoms.
---
Im personal just going to wait till the 7th before I use rank up if I don’t make it.
---
Honestly I was expecting it to play different music, but at the same time I’m not surprised it doesn’t. Still looks cool, which is what they were banking on I suspect by selling it. EZ money. GG.
---
I went from 500-700 in one double xp weekend.  I’m now level 800 playing casually.  You can easily max 6 cards before level 600 even if you swapped builds a lot.
---
I very nearly put my CAMP there, but my turrets kept getting wrecked by pretty high-level spawns so moved to a lower-level lead deposit near Top of the World.  
---
It's a good spot, if you want to build a fortress-style CAMP.
---
Yeah, I just wasted atoms. Base model is actually cooler.
---
That title belongs to final fantasy xiv. It's a clusterfuck until you fix it.
---
This just reminded me I need to change mine now
---
The fatigues haven't been put in the shop yet.
---
Just check the atom store daily I haven't seen the fatigues so hope we didnt miss them
---
The way it's worded.
---
I frequently use more “rural” outfits and designs, so naturally a mutated lizard/dragon thing claw doesn’t really fit. 
---
For me personally, a Yao Guai gauntlet of sorts would suit my character much better. But that’s just me wishing upon a Bethesda shaped star..
---
that jukebox looks cool
---
I dont hear aby music coming from it,  it's  powered up 🤷‍♂️
---
Ty!
---
Ah that’s unfortunate. :( 
---
I think I gotta renew mine on February 3rd since I got the year long one. Definitely worth it in my experience, that tent I have beside the water tower at the station is basically a second home to me. Ha ha 
---
(I AFK there in my private server so I don’t AFK at my house and it gets attacked or something... Turrets like to pick fights with vertibots and Grahm.)
---
what system are you on
---
OP Chainsaw...?
---
I'm just waiting for the Arktos Pharma refrigerator to come back round, missed it the last time...
---
Pretty sure the arm blocks a huge amount of screen, doubly so with the 50cal.though don't have it so am not 100% sure
---
I wish i could give more than an upvote...
---
3 levels of pharmacist is 3 perk points. Bandolier is 2 levels.
---
Maybe not, I just thought they came at reset which was an hour ago. Even still, I haven't even seen the option to claim the banner and I've made sure to log on every day to check. So I'm screwed on that, I suppose.
---
Aww that sucks. I have found the outfit on the rare apparel scavenger trader. What platform are you on?
---
Well you are technically not supposed to change your builds around but Bethesda gave you an option and you chose to waste all your perk points.
---
Fast travel to someone in your team already in the mine.
---
Yep. And it random encounter same as some spot.
---
It can be:
---
- faction vs creature
---
- creature vs creature.
---
Yeah, it is amazing
---
I've been actively checking since I learned about it in January or February - so sometime before that.
---
Nope :/
---
If you're on ps4, I can make you one!
---
i have to gather what's available, not what i want
---
You’re doing Gods work. Thank you, friend.
---
I've already completed it.  
---
I hope the next season has better rewards, I was only really excited for the door.
---
the situation seems to be vastly improved around the Monogah Mine
---
My money is on the datamining crew, but I kinda want to see where this goes...
---
It's going to be like $15-18 in the shop when Steel Dawn drops for sure
---
OMG. Thank you!!!!
---
Hehe I put my camp on that building... lots of stuff spawn there, making a return to my camp always interesting
---
I didn't think so
---
In my experience the 3 star mystery pick is the event reward and has nothing to do with looting earl or the chest. The chest can be pretty nice with up to 500 caps in it, but I recommend you to stay in the mine with earl.
---
This way you can farm wendigos for screws , and since they drop the ammo that your current equipped weapon uses it is a nice way to farm some ammo back. (with The Fixer i need 1 or 2 shots to kill them, and they'll drop ~35 ammo back)
---
It also doesnt matter if you stay in the mine until the timer runs out, you will just be ported outside the mine, just like leaving the mine with the actual entrance.
---
Only an hour and half not sure why it told you 24 hrs
---
lol ... i saw that but decided to watch someone else try it first !  from now on I'll keep it - thanks !
---
luck of the draw isn't necessarily bad, it's just that there are better perks. if you're struggling and need some extra points, better to unequip it. otherwise, nothing wrong with it.
---
Yeah, I have all the rewards multiple times over for Encryptid and still run it every time it comes up because it's fun. I was joking about the fact that most times you just end up with a nocturnal rolling pin and a hat for probably the third most difficult boss in the game. It definitely needs a reward adjustment along with Project P which gives you a lab coat for your troubles.
---
If you intend to launch a nuke, I say Cryptographer is easier than Hunter.  Hack 3 terminals of each level and launch a nuke.  The exam is easier than the Archer exam as well, in my opinion.
---
The event isn't even over 
---
It'll be in the shop next week
---
Wallpaper the horizon with little yellow dots.
---
I wish I saw this earlier
---
God yes that's annoying.
---
Some will.
---
This. Spending before the last day is unnecessary. Get everything you cam for free then spend less money on the last day.
---
Each silo has a 1 hr and 30 min timer for one person but someone else can do it if they haven't launched a nuke yet in that silo
---
Damn.i bought the responder bundle for the themed armor,weapon's and power armour  station skins.they have new ones out?
---
Unfortunately not, it’s just a reskin of the jukebox with the same music.
---
I mean my money is on me just getting the item from the event. Lol I can’t speak to what they found I can only say what I experienced.
---
sci-fi and fantasy often cross over the border, as it were. I've always enjoyed that part of Fallout; it has a lot of stuff you'd expect to see, but there are some elements that hint at the supernatural.
---
Some of the superhero and villain stuff looks out of place, but that is quite intentional; they all look like stage props. Hubris Comics were very popular, after all. It makes sense that such items would exist and be "repurposed" in the wasteland.
---
I know it is just a matter of taste and we may not agree, but I personally wouldn't mind some more mild, fantasy themed stuff. As long as it still fits the setting.
---
Man I did this by mistake way back and didn't realize it till way later, had to go back scrambling like mad to find it. 
---
Thankfully I eventually did.
---
September 10. 
---
As a reminder, you can always check the game's website for helpful info such as the dates of stuff.
---
Why are you even slightly shocked that the Brotherhood themed item isn't in the shop before the  Brotherhood themed dlc drops?
---
That was sarcasm
---
Any reason sites like this or the Behemoth pond don't get marked on your map?
---
Correct, but if youre a player who doesnt carry many drugs/chems  than you would not have invested in traveling pharmacy.
---
However that same player could use/hoard a boat load of ammo, so that back pack mod would save them 2 perks. 2 saved perks are better than no saved perks. That i whyni mentioned it depends on play style.
---
Upon release if someone was in your spot you lost your camp and like 50% of the items didnt store. You also had no option to look for another world. Just poof gone. As a starting player it was tuff crafting workbenches over and over.
---
Yep I totally believe you. Remember to add you used god mode next time ,so people can evaluate what you say correctly.
---
Don't bother claiming you didn't,I don't care now.
---
Whats the point of being a shotgun build if I can't cripple my enemies?
---
*Why are we still here, just to suffer?*
---
It doesn't make any sense though.  Why would they put those two things together?
---
It's cool, but I already have a Vault Tec armor bench. 
---
Can I please have an ammo bench of power armor stand please?
---
yeah you missed the banner.
---
Oh, ok. That sounds like a plan.
---
I look forward to my 25 2mm rounds a day. ;)
---
Right. My mistake, it was probably that. 
---
Has that always been the case?
---
Yep, prevents server hopping and launching nukes
---
I hate cheaters with a passion and I’ve made posts detailing how to get lots of xp without cheating.
---
I really want a set of assaultron triplets as a boss fight. 
---
Or how bout a blaster master type set up with a smart super mutant leading a colloses super mutant boss.
---
Ok thanks
---
I should have said, I'm on pc
---
If you were logged in it autocompleted and now we're screwed.
---
Available tomorrow
---
All the jukeboxes have played just Classical. It doesn't make sense, really, But there should be multiple versions, like the regular radio.
---
Hasn't happend to me before, Guess it just picked the right moment to start doing it
---
I've yet to find that kind of trader :(
---
I'm on pc
---
Every time I've traveled to the Observatory there has been a tent nearby. Definitely FT up there and check before you make the long trek.
---
Because the last line reads "Paint can be applied to the Server Service Armor". The rest of the description says Power Armor. And nothing about what Bethesda does makes any sense. Lol
---
I'm on pc unfortunately
---
Ya, re-coloring some of the common outfit would be great. Just anything new would be pretty great honestly.
---
Do you also get attacked by a legendary sheepsquatch every day or is it just me?
---
Guess that's what I was doing. Makes sense.
---
Once you get the code, you can go ham.
---
Another nothing update. So many cool things data mined an not a single one. Just more reskins of items we already have.
---
Yeah, like we'll get the patch in Sept - its all been delayed recently, I'd guess Patch 22 will be October...
---
Aww come on man it was my little secret
---
Kinda jelly
---
I'll be livid if I miss the Collectron over this bug. Here's hoping I don't get screwed on it.
---
I don't doubt what you saw, but sometimes the brain makes funny memories. Also sometimes completion of event or a fast travel will trigger a lagged previous reward. Also, maybe something server side is affecting it and yours is legit. Who's to know.
---
I mean, ACP got delayed for further "polishing" and when it released, it was a buggy mess regardless if they took the time to make it "better".
---
well see that one was $10 and came with all power armors, but this one is $8 and only comes with the one you want. You're saving $2 /Bethesda\_Logic
---
It's not even the full play list of classical,  just that one tune that get old like immediately. 
---
Want ones that plays that music from biv, the purveyor,  and something that plays 5he creepy church organ music.
---
Ah dang. I'm on Xbox and have a spare. I find her at Lost Home over in the bog. I'm sure you'll find someone here to help but if you're ever in the mood to server hop, that's a good spot to do it to find clean outfits and rare apparel.
---
AA/B/J with LmbDmg or FFR. LMGs and .50s are cool
---
The ultimate answer.
---
The T65 is Secret Service armor
---
You wouldn't know unless you are affected or happened across the info on a forum. 1300 hours on the game just happened to me.
---
Did anyone post this weeks releases?
---
Im right there with ya.  Earl gave a 3* nocturnal sickle, and the event gave me 2* suppressors A.G.Launcher.
---
I agree and disagree with you. It wouldn't make sense to bundle those 2 items together and putting a few seconds of thought before buying it I believe everyone else could come to this same conclusion as well. However, they don't specify PA jetpack and only say secret service, and since both the PA and regular armor are called that, it could be misleading. Again though, it doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
---
That's ok I cannot stand take me home country road in the slightest never have been able too.  I live love Gnr and diamond city radio. Maybe because I don't like country. I like 76 shared songs that the other games have also.
---
Please Bethesda- make the juke play Appalachia radio
---
You actually seen the text? If it was just a sound it coulda been the luck perk to repair your wep on hit. It sounds just like a legendary mutating. I lowkey stopped using it cause of that. Haha
---
You’re onto something
---
Maybe the guarantee is from earl then? I haven’t paid attention to what ive gotten from him.
---
Nope, not true at all. I have people buy ammo for more than 1 cap. Depends on the ammo. I generally price it at just under half the price, or 1 cap if it's worth 2-3. But not all ammo is 1-3 caps. Some of it is much more expensive. 
---
Gets bought ALL THE TIME. So yeah, wrong. 
---
As for the mounted heads, I agree, and I won't put them up for sale, I just drop them. The icicle and Santa crash maybe like 20 caps each. But I've got better things to put in my vending.
---
I wasn't on reddit for weeks....
---
.50 cal is probably the best all-arounder. LMG and gauss minigun have the best dps but are impossible to keep fed. gatling gun and plasma caster have high single shot damage and are ammo efficient, for dealing with trash mobs. gatling plasma is a good alternative to the .50 cal and its ammo is cheap to craft. gatling laser has arguably even cheaper ammo but low dps, similarly to the minigun. ultracite gatling lasers are better.
---
can't go wrong with bloodied, junkie's, vampire's with faster fire rate and faster reload/reduced weight.
---
I’d like to confirm this, me and my friend stumbled on this place and spent about an hour there. Firstly fighting mutants and a legendary whilst also fighting a sheepsquatch, there’s definitely Nuka cola in there too because we used it to keep ourselves alive
---
But what is the question? ;)
---
Flamers are pretty fun
---
Forest scout mask for 15 caps, then went across the river in the forest to a different camp and got a VTU cap for 25 caps. It was an awesome day.
---
SOoooo many days later.. and still no FIX? Come on really? 
---
Your taking your sweet time to fix the "MAIN QUEST" of the game.. lol -.-
---
“Play that same song”. Okay, same song! *cue Star Wars cantina music*
---
Unfortunate, but not my problem.  I would love to fix that bug, but I can't.
---
I’m still waiting for the clandestine T-65 skin and vertibird skin
---
F
---
I’m a full health heavy gunner and I’m used to tanking anything, but Earle is something else. I have a two shot  prime Gatling plasma and with buffs I’m seeing 12 damage per hit maybe a little more on his head. And my prime anti armor gauss mini gun that does around 50 per hit on the queen does maybe 9 on Earle. My flamer is a furious 3* with all the mods does over 100 per hit on a regular wendigo, does 25 to 30 per hit on Earle. You just have to be right up on him to use it. Right in foot stomping range. He’s doable I’m just not soloing him.
---
That definitely makes playing a new character sound exciting.
---
The turrets shoot grahm? Poor guy...
---
What's the Theramin do???
---
We're you logged on when the challenges updated? Many claim this is the reason.
---
I really enjoy this concept, thanks for sharing
---
I had a camp there for a while. Relatively constant free shit.
---
I hope they do delay the next patch to work on these damage numbers. They are still horrible RN in pts. They needa work on the nerf better cause most things are unusable now.
---
Oh baby. My endurance (4) cards are Sunkissed I and Ghoulish III. Time to spec into "what rads?" then.
---
That sounds cool, any idea which patch it was in?
---
Oh I wana gonna but but fuck that
---
The .50 is a good weapon in terms of ammo efficiency (easy to craft lots of it).  FFR is a good alternative to the explosive effect.  AA or Bloodied are my preferences for the main effect.
---
I wasn’t interested in VT stuff when the armor and weapon benches were released, so this great for me. Here’s hoping they cycle VT pristine benches for 1st members for awhile like they did with the ugly, atomic armor paints.
---
This is whybi haven't spent any of the atoms I've earned yet as don't know whats worth is and whats not.
---
IT'S ALL I WANT.  Thanks for posting this... It's a necessity
---
yes trying to explain this to other people is a chore they never quite understand
---
Add me on pc
---
Do they drop plasma core?
---
What bug?
---
The Explosive ones are trash too but cool to use
---
F76 will lose more than half its player base if all duped &amp; legacy weps were removed.
---
I dont think Beth can track dupes either, all weps have diff IDs now duped or no, so they could not remove strictly duped weps only.
---
Most "legit" players also have a few duped weps they've centered builds around that will get screwed by them being removed.
---
Most these people wont restart their builds from scratch either because this game is ass.
---
Removing dupes/legacies would hurt dupers more than legits, but you're fooling yourself if you don't think there would be the biggest outflow of legit players to date if this change happened.
---
Just bought it. That set is amazing
---
Do you have his balls in a display case? Maybe with a lighthouse souvenir between? Because I’m seeing that everywhere.
---
So basically what I'm getting from these comments is I should go with the 50. Cal?
---
No mannequins?  I am profoundly disappointed and my entire day is ruined.
---
The hat always spawns in the Pumpkin House NE of 76. If you haven't been there look up its location and go there. If someone has picked it up then it won't be but 99% of the time its always there.
---
I would like a Harpoon Gun that fires shovels, yes.
---
Str buff only occurs when below 10 str otherwise it's removed and the only thing that makes you close to rad immunity is Chinese stealth suit or hazmat.  And with normal armor, you don't get just get jetpack and b
---
Backpack: you get 3*** Legendary pieces upto 5 of your choice.  Look , I'm already exhausted from arguing with the other guy, so I'm not doing this again  . I just want to be able to carry large amounts of ballistic ammo without having to lose 2 points in str for bandolier
---
3 nukes per 3 hours.
---
didn't know about the hidden bit. nice. but as a sneak commando I'm in caution 99% of the time, so.
---
If you use a T-65 PA helmet as the base, and you switch to third person, the headlamp will point to the right.
---
solid bar says folks need you
---
Me:looks to the other way
---
The guy rocking out in the ad is probably a junkie to rock hard to classical..
---
Looks...
---
I don't remember their names but you should tag those 3 community devs answer here sometimes.
---
I've got the hat but it's the dress I need
---
Well I'm honestly not sure what else I'd call not even having the banner show up in the Atom Shop to claim despite donating that week and logging in every day to check. Certainly doesn't seem like that's the intended result considering people have it and the event description itself says every player gets it if the community hits the milestone.
---
does it tear a hole in the fabric of reality if i use it?
---
I use a 50 cal too, but the thing is ammo consumption doesn't worry me because I easily make 10 to 15k ammo when I need it.
---
if you want a solid gun all around, yes. can't go wrong with the .50 cal.
---
it doesn't excel at anything but it's really good for every scenario.
---
If only it made plasma cores.....
---
It's not from Earle, it's from the event.
---
Earle gives a 1-3* Legendary.
---
The event gives a guaranteed 3* Legendary and has the possibility of dropping a Cursed weapon.
---
You have potential to walk away with 3 Legendaries between Earle and the event itself.
---
Pretty sure Beth can freely manipulate dmg numbers as they see fit.
---
But why would they?
---
Most legacy weps are weak AF against actual endgame bosses.
---
They wreck normal mobs, but so do half the other weps in the game.
---
They wreck pvp maybe more than other weps?  Idk I hate pvp and never participate.
---
It was part of the Waster bundle I think - seeing the Raider PA in the shop reminded me I didn't get it when it dropped
---
Is your 76 name the same as your reddit name?
---
No wonder he is in constant pain
---
Contemporary at 1200 atom?
---
I hope this thing to come back.
---
yeah
---
I'm well aware that majority of weapons in this game are dupes. I was talking about legacy items that ruin the game in so many levels. Not once did i mention ordinary legendary items.
---
I sell most of my spare ammo at 1cap and others at 3-5. If it's enough to turn into the converter I'll spend a few minutes.    
---
Currently, I have a lot of plans and mods for free or 1cap. I'm on PC but don't know when I'll be on today most likely later this evening CST.
---
It's an instrument you can use to get "well tuned".
---
Anyone have a problem with 60 seconds respawn?
---
I'll add you in a few minutes then
---
That used to be a spawn for a Sentrybot, the rock above is good for sniping. Good times.
---
Where to see this Veritbird PA?
---
What’s the prefix on the LMG?

Not surprised honestly bethesda doesn’t seem to care about skins at all unless they’re overhauls and even then their effort can be passable at most. They’ve done this with bone raider for excavator armour I bought the normal one and needless to say I was confused to see others roaming around in red until I saw it in the store being sold separately.  It annoys me that they add these new armours then do nothing afterwards they added ultracite when the game released but there wasn’t and still isn’t any skins available in game for the armour and now there isn’t for T-65 can’t even get old fallout 4 power armour skins without getting into dev room I don’t see why those are aren’t implemented you also can’t get the blood eagle raider power armour skin the npcs have. I’ve bought both the desert and forest bundle I’m surprised they even added it to t-65 separately or not cause ultracite hasn’t seem that same affection.
---
Both base game and atomic shop jukeboxes play classical music instead of Appalachia Radio that plays 50s era pop and so forth.
---
I'm waiting for that chrome enclave skin I saw a while back. Where is that please.
---
Game states Condition *and* Durability but only actually affects Condition.
---
The same thing happened with me today. I was shooting the guy trying to get him to stop. He had his DMs set to private so I couldn't message him either
---
Squeeeeeee!
---
Gonna buy it right now, I hope it's a spooky tune.
---
Adore Halloween stuff,  and need more for my Silent Hill camp.
---
J both ones. JE 50  &amp; JFFR LMG
---
Do you mean x02?
---
Cake.
---
Yeah, I totally get that, which is why I understand why they were axed.
---
Which legacy weps?
---
How do they ruin the game?
---
Legacies almost universally suck at sbq.
---
What challenges reward Perk Card Packs?
---
Do you mean Nuclear Winter Challenges? Because those are not Perk Card Packs, they're NW Card Packs and you can't use them to get Perk Coins.
---
Inert flux will weigh more than purified water If you’re using the thru-hiker perk. Inert flux does give -5% disease resistance when you drink it though.
---
Well done. I had a heated debate about this the other day. Suprised about the hidden damage though
---
is it discounted?
---
Do 20% health bloodied 50 cal, but instead of bloodied use vampire.  You get the majority of low health damage but you won't die.  Other guns have higher dps, but this is an easy way to do enough damage and have tons of ammo. 
---
When I was using a gauss minigun I had to constantly farm for ammo.  Now I do less damage, but not bu much, but most importantly I make 10k to 15k ammo at a time easily
---
There was a specific window that the Banner and Beret were available. Both were in the shop for several days, and that was after the challenges were completed, not during.
---
I'll update it.
---
Fun but very thirsty.
---
Well fatigues come out tomorrow....
---
Not sure why you missed the banner. I’m guessing you checked the wrong day for that as well.
---
Also collection comes out on the 4th if we hit goal and only available through the 7th.
---
D E T E C T I V E !
---
I couldn't say for sure, but Bethesda has seemingly always loved making interesting or useful little unmarked spots like this. As a player I enjoy stumbling across these kinds of places and feeling like I'm in on a secret, whereas with marked locations they are certainly more convenient but feel much more public I guess.
---
&gt;maxing out all legendary perks
---
Thank you, these are the answers I was most interested in.
---
Looks like I'm going to invest mostly in more SPECIAL points and set myself up to switch between any build I want at any time.
---
Afterward I might focus on the damage perks, although they seem like a bit of a waste. Follow Through only works for stealth builds and will probably work well against high-tier mobs, but against bosses when it's hard to maintain stealth in large groups it won't be very effective. Taking One for the Team can work with any build, but if you one- or two-shot most mobs it's really only worth it against bosses, but of course only if you get hit. I feel like I might go stealth commando for casual play and heavy for boss fights.
---
This whole thing is so "meh."
---
I wish there was more synergy.
---
Yeah that or the Gatling Gun.
---
If it has a name, I don't know it. Just saw on a datamine video awhile back and looked dope.
---
I found an executioners explosive harpoon gun for 2k. It wasnt the greatest of legacies but it was surprising for sure
---
Yes. I realize this. I said that I checked the shop after the challenge was completed, every day, for multiple days, and it was not there for me to claim.
---
Or better yet a functioning mmo
---
can’t wait for the what is rads perk
---
Let me play Country Roads over and over, damn it!
---
I cannot find this place :( nevermind I'm stupid.
---
Gatling plasmas, I prefer furious ones. The ammo
---
 efficiency is unmatched when compared to other heavy weapons
---
It was very scary for my newish character who wanted to build a camp there after seeing one on the settlement subreddit
---
Earle himself can drop a 1-3* Legendary. The event, A Colossal Problem, forces a 3* Legendary.
---
There's a lot of confusion, because when you have multiple splash screen pop-ups (Event completed, legendary item acquired, etc), often they will not all display properly. With ACP, you can get up to 4 such splash screens (ACP complete, potential legendary from Earle, guaranteed legendary from ACP, potential Cursed legendary). If you complete the event successfully, you will have the 3* Legendary :)
---
15 is the Hard Cap for SPECIAL points.
---
The falling ceiling at acp is also fire dmg
---
After reading that explanation, I feel like life in general has me wi-flagged. They need a patch for the year 2020.
---
I can't see how; I logged in every day. Could've sworn the beret was out on reset, so I figured the other rewards would be, too.
---
Oh, fantastic! I didn't know they fixed it!
---
I guess Bethesda doesn't want you to move anytime soon 😂
---
Lots and lots of fucking booze and radaways.
---
Genius
---
No, 15 is the max.
---
IMO, the Legendary module when crafting should bring up a Tier list and then you choose which effects you want. Might sound OP but knowing how 99% of drops are random BGS made sure the tedious grind would be big in 76.    
---
Tier 1 modules would cost X caps.    
---
Tier would cost Y caps.    
---
Tier 3 would cost Z caps.    
---
I for one LOATHE Unyielding and Bloody.
---
All due respect, but with the amount of things I've seen people miss, I can't discount the possibility that it was there and you simply didn't see it.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply, I really appreciate it! You make a good point with the Hubris Comics content. 
---
I guess that the "fantasy" part of the series that I appreciate the most is when the game feels more lovecraftian. I'm still awed by the Dunwich Borers sequence in Fallout 4. I would love it the content were more about that kind of lore :)
---
From my experience most people don't use voice chat - especially newer folks.
---
It should have played all the classic 50's era music from 3 &amp; NV. I'd have paid 1k Atoms.if it played Kick in the Head.
---
So it has to be all the same type and weight? No more full heavy or sturdy mixed sets then... But what about:
---
Can I mix sturdy and heavy combat?
---
Can I mix urban and forest scout?
---
It's the robot vendor near the Grafton mayor and not at Grafton station, right?
---
Do we know that it's 25% damage resist and not just +25 to your DR total? The actual wording on the chem is "25 Damage" without the percentage symbol.
---
I broke all my guns. Similar experience, but with a sword.
---
I think it’s part of the Van Lowe questline about the Sheepsquatch
---
Giggity
---
Are you serious?
---
You can get flamer fuel from the ammo converter, which really helps
---
“AAA”.
---
This is where I am finding myself learning to work with a group when fighting Earle. I am finding it hard to always be doing my max damage when in a group in some of the fights.
---
I don’t seem to trigger this in every fight but the longer I stay up the more I seem to end up in caution. So far my best bet has been to eat some fire and start over from the drop.
---
i wouldnt have asked if i wasnt
---
I would pay double the atoms for a Cantina Band only jukebox or radio station.
---
There are new building rules?
---
No poodle skirt, no vt bomber jacket...
---
Everything that comes back has came back a hundred times.
---
It seems I'm going to stop playing with unexpended atoms in my account. Sigh.
---
From my experience, it is completely subjective. You'll find pretty much every atom shop item at someones camp- some of which is cooler than your items, some of which is not. So it boils down to what you want.
---
The contemporary camp bundle and the golden rocket ride seem to be the go-to's for this week though, if that helps.
---
I thought the same thing. I've server jumped more times than I care to say because I didn't want my camp packed away.
---
Oh, I definitely agree with the Lovecraftian aspects. Dunwich Borers was SO fun to run across randomly on my first playthrough. Poor Cait was terrified.
---
I'm very intrigued by the stuff in fo76, too. I hope they expand on it, maybe give us another "Lovecraftian" themed quest.
---
Fallout was better when the post-apocalypse came before the atom-punk instead of the other way around, and I’m more concerned about that than any apparent fantasy.
---
But I agree with floaters.. they’re just so unrealistic to fight but also their design is grossly generic, if they really were anything like Fallout 2, they would have been from the get go in Wastelanders. These unfortunate additions desperately need an overhaul, cosmetically and mechanically. “#MakeFloatersGreatAgain” whatever makes Bethesda realise just how bottom of the barrel these things are in the creative department.
---
As for the plasma caster, I think it would’ve fit better in some sort of Zetan mini-quest but otherwise I’m not sure it’s actually fantasy and just a tried-too-hard to look cool within an atom punk theme. Again they’re pushing atom punk too hard as a theme without any depth in my opinion. 
---
The bow is fine on its own, but yes all these mods feel so unrealistic. Only the explosive and plasma arrows actually feel immersive when using the bow, poison seems like a stretch because I’m sure the radiation would’ve stopped anything poisonous doing anything.
---
The sheepsquatch staff actually feels like a deranged raider came up with it, just my personal headcannon but otherwise yes it does feel like it was inspired more by fantasy than anything a radioactive apocalypse would’ve come up with. Just one of those things “to fit the theme” of the update.
---
The tenderiser was originally an unobtainable item that only Grahm could use, so I would assume it was Super Mutant themed rather than fantasy themed although if compared to Orcs of the fantasy world then maybe? But I would just pass it off as Super Mutant ingenuity and their understanding of tools.
---
I actually never understood thorn/solar armour myself and agree that the perks they provide actually take away from the post apocalyptic atmosphere of Fallout.
---
I don’t really know what to say about the Wendigo Colossus other than, I think the main consciousness for example Earle Williams, consumed other wendigos but instead of actually digesting them, they became absorbed but wouldn’t explain why it looks the way it does. When I first saw it I thought it might’ve been a human experiment a bit like the human centipede.
---
I agree with flux, namely the fact that the rad shower in 76 requires flux but the one in 4 doesn’t it make sense either that plants can provide armour to underlinings.
---
Finally the atom shop, just seems to be the cherry on top with the issue that is the atmosphere of Fallout, it’s too atom punk heavy. Like adding dieselpunk to emo, it doesn’t mix well and I’ve actually been comparing the recent year’s atom shop items to that of The Outer Worlds. They’ve moved quite a ways away from the atmosphere of what makes it Fallout. It’s too colourful and sci-fo focused and it’s too distracting from might be considered post apocalyptic or radioactive distopia. That’s just my opinion on it though and prefer the atmosphere that came with Fallout 3 and New Vegas more. Fallout 4’s atmosphere was alright but could’ve been darker, and then 76 went head first into atom punk without actually making it fit into the atmosphere of the game, what was supposed to be the apocalypse feel more like a futuristic plague and the atom shop has been enabling that. Again just my opinion on the cosmetics vs the theme vs the missing apocalypse.
---
I got mine from a player vendor for 2000 caps not long ago.    
---
After I learned it, I got a Two Star one from the Daily from the Astronaut lady.
---
That’s true, but it consumes fuel so fast. Fun as hell though. I am lucky enough to have a legacy bloodied explosive flamer that I bring out now and then just for kicks. Usually once every few weeks, just save fuel I collect or can find at vendors til I have a few k worth then treat myself to some carnage.
---
I've already ran this event 60+ times and this 14% chance drop eludes me. Likely Bethesda trying to conceal this knowledge from me.
---
It's a shame, however the next update has no confirmed date as of yet, which leaves me to presume the score challenges could continue every week up to the update. I don't see why not?
---
Edit: I've just seen a confirmed end date as next Tuesday. Now I feel silly. Apologies.
---
Yeah, im confused
---
I have no idea it's a bit confusing. Surely if it's a matching armour set then every piece has to be the same name as each other e.g. scout armour, marine armour, combat armour etc. 
---
Urban and forest is still scout armour, so they should work together.
---
You perceive someone being annoying as jealous of your camp? Dude get over yourself haha, what is this a post to let everyone know you have a ‘legacy’ camp? Cool
---
Yeah I have a vampires saved for my heavy weapons character, never bothered to max out their level though
---
The lazies thank you
---
It’s not the fact it’s a wolf or that a .44 could kill it it’s that the multiple damage markers were showing
---
I'm only donating cloth for the BoS collectron. Saves me buying one from the Atomic Shop
---
All well and good, but I need a way to get Atoms. With no daily challenges, I'm completely spinning my wheels.
---
Is there some way to switch between SCORE challenges, which I've completed, and dailies, so that I have a reason to log on every day? 
---
Because, right now?
---
There's no reward. I need my carrots, man.
---
Maybe it's the old concrete bunkers you could build?
---
no sadly
---
Iv meet some awsome high-levels. And now im high-level too. Most of them will 100% heal a dead player. And some give loads of ammo they dont need. Thank you! 
---
I give everybody back, mostly drugs and water.
---
I mean, that's a fair assumption and I don't blame you for it. Plus it's not like I seem to have a lot of integrity in the sub, judging by how often I get downvoted for asking questions.
---
Were you logged on? Trying to figure out if this is caused by being logged on or if the game just decided to auto complete random people's score events?

Cover mechanics are shoddy at best in fallout. Bullets go through walls all the time. 
---
Fallout sometimes can be a game that is meant to be played a certain way. You can overcome it, but it is equal to shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Like you say, the game is difficult even though you are in a generally level appropriate area.
---
As others have said, not using sneak and diversifying your perks so you are not specializing in one type of weapon is adding to your difficulty.
---
a skin for the workbench armor
---
I personally don't count that as ability to solo. Quests are what I use to help level my character up, not what I do after my character is levelled all the way up.
---
Just switched from stealth sniper to PA heavy and it’s hella fun. If they ever add the Anti-Material rifle from NW I’ll switch back.
---
Has the satellite dish ever been sold by itself before? *snapping that up*

Make sure you buy your progress because the score this week auto completes a screwed a ton of players....

I'll just add, I've found her while doing the Photo Opportunity daily at the camp site east of Crater lots of times. Seems she's a pretty regular spawn there too.
---
I'd love a "new" category for recently learned plans and atomic shop purchases. I'm super into building and have all the in game camp plans and a lot of atomic shop items. When I buy a bundle sometimes I forget about certain items because they're all scattered throughout the build menu. Same if I learn a lot of new plans quickly.  Would love to easily see everything I just got in one menu like the recent menu.
---
I did.
---
Dont see a reason why they need to be removed, except "lag" I guess?
---
He really does. I'll be in my camp and I won't be paying attention and hear it going off and it's always a little eerie.

u/ladydevann did the team have a chance to verify if spawning into a nuke zone (but not the nuke blast itself) is meant to demolish your CAMP? Would it help in any way if I submitted a support ticket?
---
Thanks again!
---
No.
---
Atom, please join us in what we're about to do.
---
Yeah, there is plenty of spots there to plop something down.
---
I can attested to this, the arm takes up almost 1/3 of the screen. Only playable in 3rd person
---
Damn it, can they PLEASE resell the giant letters?? I'm dying to have those Borderlands-style letters in my CAMP!
---
You can always tell it's free icon day when you jump into a team and everyone has the same one :)
---
That sucks, guess I was just seeing thing. Thanks for the quick response!
---
I mean I had a stealth brawler, a sniper woman, a heavy weapons guy, Kurt Cobain and I planned to make a character built for charisma who I'd use for cap sales 
---
Maybe I should come back and level them all up?
---
Nope, 1200 atoms.
---
Set it to 5.56 and empty it out once an hour.  It just cranks that stuff out.  If I am just doing dailies and stuff it produces more ammo than what I end up using.
---
I see this visual bug a lot with my gat laser/plasma and it is just a visual bug for them. Except then I have partially used cores sitting in my inventory after, which isnt fun. It goes to zero as expected, and i have watched it do it, then it jumps to between 20 and 200 rounds during the reload sequence. Leaving me with cores that have that many rounds in it.
---
I used to be surprised at what I thought were rare flavors, then I walked into an entrance for Whitesprings that I don't normally use...
---
"Oh, there's a vendor that just sells Nuka Cola. Huh..."
---
Whoa, whoa ... that makes entirely too much sense.
---
Bethesda just needs to stop putting out road maps.  They should just make a general statement saying that new content will be rolled out on a regular basis, and they will announce it when it is ready to roll.
---
This business of saying what's coming out in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter  is really pointless because they never stick to it.  Also they need to stop talking about content that is not contained in the next patch. They are notorious for teasing upcoming content, and when they do people often assume that this new content will be in the next patch (and it never is).  This leads to frustration and confusion.
---
Don't talk about new content until it's read to drop. Otherwise, shut up.
---
If they don't announce content that is not ready. then they don't to announce delays.   And their claims that delaying the content means more polished content is a  complete joke.
---
The real treasure was the friends we made along the way!
---
No G3 Handmade skin....
---
I'm dead inside.
---
Agreed. Unless you're in Nuclear Winter, it just isn't a viable playstyle. I mean it's fun, but none of the dedicated semiauto keep up.
---
They mention 2 weeek gap between seasons when they first introduced them
---
what do you mean the gay? do you mean the pride flag? if yes you can just say prideflag, then you also dont sound as homobhobic
---
Figured theyd delay it until patch 22.
---
which doesnt make sense to release a new season a week/forthnight before a big patch
---
Well it's very obvious that  you didn't read so i see no reason to continue this conversation.
---
It seems there’s a huge number of posts right after the refresh every day. And very few more than half hour after. It has to be related. And the one time, at rank 98, I remained logged in for a meat week event at the refresh I got the auto complete. Never logged in at that time before. Not had it before
---
Sometimes i like to do every event &amp; daily possible and have a screen like this one the next day, i honestly don't care my eyes are not watching the right side xd
---
Does it make him not move around?
---
Almost as bad as a visit to the PTS un-equipping all your emotes (except the basic ones) and drop/death bag skins etc.
---
This NW cheat cycle has ebbed and flowed since it's birth. I remember times where erectus would come in with his fat boi character and level up to 200 in a couple of days with nothing being done. During a free FO weekend. Sure it left a bad taste in many a mouth.
---
After update 20 there was peace. Many of us started offing the good players easily. Realized something had happened. They lost their aim boy tools.
---
Now we're back to turrets in the lobby and the likes.
---
I absolutely love NW. I get a sense the game had that old school battlefield feel. Slower paced more tactical fast fights. 10 mins of silence with 30 seconds of insanity. I love it. Some of my best gaming memories happened in that mode (nuking from a porta potty at the airport and killing 9 people. Gold). It's clear Bethesda is trying to focus on which part of the ship needs to stay afloat more than the other. Adventure has all of the focus. I hope NW gets more ass after they get this adventure dev cycle going.
---
Hows this?:

---
Levelling them all up might be a chore with the upcoming changes in patch 22. Would def recommend you to try a few of them out again though. Not sure how long it has been since you played them but the game has come a long way.
---
Bethesda stated it will be out later today:
---

---
Nice, I use the traveling leather coat and Deathclaw mask
---
They fixed some bugs that allowed people to build cool camps
---
I did the same with a Trapper set with RR legendary effect and lead lined, then Radshield, etc to get the highest RR. Wondered why it wasn't as effective as PA when it had more RR. Strange why they wouldn't just include the hidden RR somewhere, anywhere in the game
---
But the noise it makes?  It makes the shovel so satisfying!
---
A community manager said it’s “something being looked into” so at least there is that to wait for. It’s a bummer though.
---
So you can get them double auto completed?
---
Alright, cool. I knew in the case of like shotguns, it factors in all the pellets hit, so I wasn't sure if LotD was based on number of projectiles. Thanks!
---
Daily Ops?
---
It doesn't happen every day, it would be a good way of getting extra score when it does it work. Which would be most days. 
---
I also recommend extending the time for legendary run since armor ace won't be coming right away.
---
I got an executioner tenderizer and secret service left leg as a unique rewards so far. Looks good
---
Omfg it really is tho. And if you play on PS4 it’s just a pain in the ass to fix, I’d rather have all my quests tracked in 76 then ever touch my UI again in FFXIV.

Seems like a classic case of their left hand not talking to their right hand

it's seems that only the animation is faster, but the projectile available for you to shoot the weapon is the same as default. So you are in this awkward situation when you saw that you reloaded already and pressing the button to shoot but nothing happens for a sec

It's especially annoying since accessing that store is directly related to a bug that autocompletes your challenges, taking away your ability to use that very store...

I don't know
---
I think the sale is next week sometime.    
---
3 Stars costs the most so to increase your chances sales are the best time.    
---
What sucks is that there's no way to get the piece of armor you want. If you want a R arm you might spend all your script and never get one let alone the effects you want.    
---
Same goes for weapons. If you get something you don't want/like and have room sell it at your CAMP. The market is flooded with stupidly inflated prices so undercutting others is best to at least get something out of it.    
---
Scripting what you get at least returns some of what you spent. I have done it and only got 3 pieces I can say are good for that char and still use them.
---
I had someone message me a couple weeks ago looking for stuff. I'm the type of guy that loves helping new people and always go out of my way to help them. Helps keep the community going you know? But I always check their game progress on their Xbox profile and make sure they are newbs. 
---
If it is someone who has gone through and got most of the achievements for the game, then I'm not going to help them. Sorry not sorry, your alt 100% doesn't matter to me..
---
That being said, I had a someone message me saying he needed gear and I should give him gear since I'm level 140 at the time. Checked him out, had every single achievement in the game unlocked. So instead of taking him my newbie cache I have set aside just for newbs, I took him a nice pile of fertilizer and spoiled food and dropped it at his feet. Unfortunately he seen it and just left world with no witty comeback or anything. I, only the other hand, thought it was quite clever and funny.
---
yea i saw that same post and wish i would have had a video liek this to show them to shut them up

That makes sense. Thank you!

Okay, thanks for the info. I was thinking about getting it to replace my Waster skin which had the exact same problem. Saved me some atoms!

Well that's a pretty obvious thing to say, i am talking about how bethesda can make it up to some people who are now lagging behind and getting screwed over by auto-completion.
---
As far as i know the glitch doesn't happen everyday, though it could be worse for others.
---
So having double quests AND extending the legendary run might be their best bet to make up for things.
---
They should really make sure all the bugs are hammered out before they launch armor ace.
---
Nope
---
I mean I know the supportless ones were patched out ages ago but mines built up the side of a cliff
---
To each their own. I'm still waiting on the Verti skin or the Clandestine to go with my Miniguns.
---
Now, if I used the Shotgun, I'd definitely grab this.
---
It’s now a high chance for a random encounter between two foes in the game. EX: Scorched vs Ghouls, Sloth vs Raiders, etc.
---
I saw the thumbnail for the T-65 skin and got excited, then I realized it was Camo paint and not the Clandestine paint.
---
DISAPPOINTED!
---
Operation Health is a 3 month period...
---
First time in the atom shop I see
---
As a non legacy user.  
---
Minigun for bosses.  
---
LMG for quick firefights with higher levels enemies.   
---
Gat plasma with whatever mod that turns it to a flamer for low level mob fun.
---
Yeah my turrets open fire on friendly NPCs for some reason... Grahm, Athena, Vertibots, pets... God I’ve lost like 5 pets to my own turrets.
---
The unfortunate part about them picking a fight with the merchants is they can’t die so eventually they’ll break the turrets and move on to the rest of my camp. (Athena especially, got home one day just in time to see her shoot a head laser and break several things in my camp... That’s the main reason I don’t have space lady as an ally anymore.)
---
There isn't, but it would be super cool if there was. I would love this feature to be added.
---
plasma cores sell 40 caps a piece easy 
---
used to craft ultracite plasma cores
---
Pick a couple random players from the map and ignore them for session, that way you will not be put in the same server when you jump
---
Damn it! I need the free states 10mm sub skin
---
... and then there's me lockpicking people's collection box and running for the hills
---
CONFUSION
---
I don't have the jangles Stine and I completed the legendary run
---
Either one works. Iconvert it because free fuel.
---
I just sell them all at 1c each. Ultracite ammo at 2c.
---
The first atomic shop paint for the T65 is... camo.  Wow. Yeah... okay then.
---
Everyone has been asking for a Jukebox that plays different music for ages and this is the shit they give us. The free radicals one,  the one that Big Al's tattoo and the one in the nuclear winter lobby all exist and are way better than the ones we have but Bethesda can't be bothered and try to sell us a reskin of the shitty one that we all hate. I'm sure plenty of people will accidentally buy that not knowing any better.
---
It's out boiiiiiiii!
---
How they can make up for it is by not releasing half baked trash. Unfortunately the nearly 2 years I’ve played and nothing has ever been released as a polished product. Not once.
---
IDK.  IIRC, purified water weighed 0,5 before I picked up a WR perk, now purified water weighs 0,3 - but inert flux weighs 0.2
---
Logging out and back in usually works on regions with lots of players / servers, but on regions that have lower amount of players it normally doesn't work. I personally live in such area and i mostly get the same server over and over again, or rotate between two. As the game will try to put you on the closest server it can find to give you best possible latency. The remaining and 100% working method is to get yourself loads of friends and jump to the servers they are in.
---
I hadn't seen a lot of hate on them but I may have missed it. What kinds of complaints were they?
---
They dont owe us anything.
---
I’ve stopped dropping nukes, and or doing SBQ simply because:
---
I can’t ever land the killing blow to complete the challenge.
---
So many power hitters seem to show up that I can’t qualify for loot.
---
She’s dead before I can get there... (this is the biggest reason) 
---
She doesn’t drop things I need at this point In The game. I have just as much rng luck at the purveyor and the scrip is easy peasy to accumulate.
---
After all you can only “raid” the same event so many times before it’s obsolete.
---
Oh, in my game athena is hella dead...
---
Bought by accident because I thought it was free. Bummer, my dude.
---
You know, I honestly thought every time I see those posts "this won't happen to me. Its a rare bug." And yet. Here we are. Im just frustrated but not really all that shocked.
---
I can't stand the ammo converter....I either sell the decent ammo or drop it on the ground.
---
If you want some caps sell them (usually 1c each) if you convert, some ammo is better than others. You won’t become super rich by just doing ammo unless you have a lot of ammo that someone needs.
---
Yes, but he acts different when crippled. He walks a little bit when both his legs are crippled and crippling his other parts just decreases how often he does certain attacks. Also, his limbs heal very fast if nobody is shooting him so he often recovers 10-15% on every limb when he screams. I have noticed his limbs won't heal if somebody outside scream range continues attacking(save for legendary regen).
---
Purely speculation: I wonder if random cripple perks have a lower chance of proccing on him. I have a very hard time crippling him with Enforcer and Tormentor. I'm not sure about One Gun Army since I use that with 100s of rounds anyways, but this speculation could be based on a run of bad luck.
---
Update - just did this again.
---
Zoned in, only low levels ... I was ready to go on my main and waiting for the thing to drop. Then, as I watched the other three all drop.
---
The 71 dropped first, looked like a DCG user. Then the 128. That left me and a 17 ... who waved goodbye and zoned out.
---
So, just me and Earl. 
---
I'm still in INT / XP mode so not as efficient as I could have been. I didn't bother w/ any Ballistic Bock; just used 2 psychobuff, 1 rad shield and one bobble head (small guns). A few diluted stims (&lt;10, probably 5 ish). Head shots on a crit cycle w/ the handmade from sneak ... drop back to cover, reload, rebuild APs when needed ... repeat.
---
So much easier to do alone.
---
What ammo types would people actually buy?
---
The red rocket stairs arent that great. I prefer the future tech one myself, both looks and fits better
---
I don't care about cosmetics much but I'm sure you could find the wiki page on the dress and go from there.
---
Ignoring people won't restrict them or you joining the same servers.
---
Kinda wild that there's no gatling plasma skins. It was one of the few things folks wanted when the game was broke as shit.
---
OMG, how terrible that you had to push buttons in something that is NOTHING but pushing buttons.
---
The LMG is a magic weapon and will melt the bosses.
---
It’s random.  Only once did it autocomplete on me as I was logged in during the update.  
---
I’ve been on plenty of times at 12 we’re it didn’t autocomplete.
---
Agreed it’s annoying as all fuck.
---
They already have a rock and roll jukebox, a jazz jukebox and a ragtime jukebox in the game. I don't know why it's so hard for them to release one to us. Literally everybody would want one of them.
---
Idk man, id say the 5 daily stealth boys at top of the world beats the nuka
---
I love that spot for the random event spawns though, good find!
---
I kinda want to compile a list of really good looting spots, but I only know of like 3 that would qualify as list worthy
---
I guess you should sue them, sounds like you have precedent.
---
Same jukebox, not the same look, it's just different cosmetic
---
Yes it does i have been doing it for over a year , only time it doesnt work is if no servers are available
---
They should just autocomplete everyone at this point.  A lot of people got the hose with this bug.
---
Best? Well, it depends.
---
1) .50 Cal - best all around heavy. Ammo is easy to craft &amp; works in most situations.
---
2) Gatling Laser - very efficient for energy-based builds &amp; works well until you get a good Gatling Plasma (as mentioned below, very ammo-efficient, but slightly harder to get the plasma cores)
---
3) LMG - when you absolutely, positively need to kill every mf'er in the room, accept no substitutes (non-primed ammo is a bear to craft, however)
---
That's my list.
---
I put 5600+ shotgun shells in my vendor yesterday, expecting they'd just sit there but I sold half of them within ten mins then a little while later someone else came and bought the rest. I will always buy .45, 5.56, fusion cells, and 5mm when I see it for 1 cap.
---
I'm serious. I would find a way to have a wagon( radio flyer) drag behind me to carry my shit...either that or have a couple followers to keep handing me reloads...On another note, I am done with bolt action(even though I love them in real life)...it sucks and I am finding new love for lever action..just simply outclasses the amount of damage I can apply to a target...and does make me wait 6 seconds to switch to melee.
---
Um... perhaps you should've gone and tried it before calling bullshit.
---
If you place the camp module in the parking lot it cancels out the random encounter. I camped there for a long time and almost never was attacked.
---
556, 45, 2mm, 5mm, fusion cores is probably the best to sell. The others sell but they Will probably sit in your vendor for a while. Railway spikes, missile, mininukes and heavy ammo like that wont sell.
---
Junk, i swear they dont want my money.
---
And that's how you do that :-P
---
You can camp in here too!
---
No I guess I give back to everybody
---
u/ladydevaan
---
Please, if you could answer this:
---
My husband and I want to buy Communist bunkers, but not until we know that the ‘all objects float off the floor’ problem has been acknowledged. Do you know if the devs are aware of it, or if there is a fix planned?
---
Thank you.
---
Well there is your proof right there. You just said it yourself. "only time it doesnt work is if no servers are available" there is always servers available and if there aren't it will be made on demand. If you don't ignore people and leave the server and join the adventure mode again the exact same thing will happen. Sometimes you will be put back to the same server and sometimes not. Ignoring people has zero effect on it.
---
I sell some and transfer the rest to my mule. You never know IF you need it in the future
---
what?
---
This is upsetting. I thought I could finally get a break from hearing how depressed the radio host is.
---
Im pretty sure I was only a week late to starting the event. Add a couple of weekends I couldnt play due to family vacation, and Im only at level 82 right now.
---
I've done most of the SCORE challenges except for the NW and Level Up. I also missed the first few 'Critical Hit' weekly challenges, because despite having played for +6 months, I just learned how to get a critical hit a few weeks ago.
---
You pretty much have to play everyday to complete the season, which is a shitty way of going about this.
---
I try to help. I never completed I Am Death because I was on a team that did it and it auto-completed. I was sad. I never launched a nuke myself.
---
I live at the lead deposit near there and didn’t know that was there
---
Point taken.  
---
  My perspective is Roses quests, as well as a the final stages of a couple other of the “original” questlines) will quickly send a lower level player to places where that player will have a very tough time surviving. 
---
  Becasue of that, it may be better to back burner those, work on (or repeat) other stuff until you have the experience and weapons to deal with what you are gong to run across in the Divide and on the East side of the map.
---
What will we earn for dailies/wklys in between seasons??
---
When u launch from a silo u go on a personal cool down for that silo.   And that silo goes on a server cool down.
---

---
My friends and I started playing just a few weeks ago. And I told myself if I got to halfway, I would buy the remaining tank ups to 100.  I just hit 46 last night. Looks like I'm buying my way to the end.
---
The second point of yours is spot on. Its getting tiresome to scroll through every thing just to know what price i should set
---
I tried selling them before. 10 caps, 1 cap, heck I couldn't even give them away! They just weigh too much per unit for me to hold on to them.
---
True, could get delayed to October. Hopefully not
---
Thank you as always!
---
Welp so much for that spot
---
When my friends and I tried fighting Earle, that was pretty much my view the entire time as unarmed.
---
When I wasn't culling the wendigo spawns I was giving Earle the spanking of his life lol.
---
I drop it around low levels so that they can use it or make caps for themselves. Otherwise 1c or 0c in vending machine if stash space allows for it
---
This silents explosive bullets
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/647](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/647)
---
it  makes SBQ fights much more bearable, it works great, sorry for console folk
---
Yup, I just took it off.
---
Did you get one over level 20. I did the quest at level 70 and It gave me the level 20 after they fixed it.
---
I tend to sell 5.56 and .45 and 5mm the most quickly. Fuel/cells/2mmEC etc tend to sell, but can be a slow mover. .38 and .44 I either drop or sell for 0 caps in my vendor
---
Or...and hear me out....they could have fixed it since they already claimed to fix it in a pervious patch weeks ago. Legally they admitted to a problem in the software and are now requiring money to achieve what they know and claimed was broken and now fixed. 
---
This shit company is hoping you spend the $9 because you would never take them to court...but that's just my degree talking.
---
&lt;start rant&gt;   See, posts like these really make me want to  go the bethesda and hold them hostage. Ask them WHY we only have 150 scrip per 20 hours..why do I melee something 5 times and do damage, but it doesn't apply to the health bar till the 6 th time? HOW the FUCK is a COILGUN missing a target and WHY is it not doing MORE damage than a ballistic gun?
---
I know this is probably the billionth  time it's been brought up. The beautiful thing about having a device that can go on the internet, is you can choose to not read certain posts...like this one. Giving a shoutout to that dude who helped me when the game derped and I  was defending my base against 3 behemoths and 2 scorchbeasts!
---
&lt;end rant&gt;
---
When i fought him the first time and he did this squatting fear attack thing, I literally thought he was farting at us
---
Because removing something from a player’s inventory when they acquired it legitimately over a year ago would be a horrible customer service decision.
---
Wow, I think I was expecting exactly that kind of reply. You made my day!
---
Maybe that's the whole point, they do try too hard and give us a lot of oversaturated "try to look cool" elements -  and meanwhile drift away from the dark, barren and desolate experience. 
---
I get it though - the community was really loud at first with the "everyone is dead, game feels empty" criticism. I understand that they wanted to liven up the game in all the ways possible, including colorful doodads and enemies which stand out in content reveal trailers.
---
My point being: we're good now. There is stuff to do in the game, the map feels lively, there is a purpose to play. Can we have some love of the overall ambiance?
---
give me EDI...with that robot's LOVELY perception perk that extends to 2 miles..and 150 carrying capacity.
---
Yes, it was sold by itself. In fact it has came back a couple of times but it's not the most recurring item. It moves and has sounds.
---
Honestly I prefer the lmg but here's my take on it.
---
Gatling gun best for ammo without a doubt.
---
Minigun best fire rate and 5mm is cheap to make.
---
Gatling lasers are fun and accurate probably the best for hip fire add power user for best experience 
---
plus pew pew
---
.50cal and lmg have no wind up is the selling point here.
---
Flamer and cryolator for mob control.
---
Have seen others post that it's the same as the free version
---
Let me play Devils Advocate here.. I don’t have nor have I ever had a legacy weapon, but for some people they were legitimate weapons that they spent time grinding for.
---
There is no way those should be removed .. 
---
Sure if Bethesda can locate and remove dupes that is one thing but removing legitimate weapons Is the start of a lot of issues ...
---
The Gauss minigun. Kinda explosive though...
---
"When you block another player for a session, that means that they will not be able to interact or communicate with you at all while you are currently playing during that session. If you simply choose to block them, this will do so permanently until you otherwise decide to unblock them.
---
According to Bethesda, blocking someone means that *"you will no longer be able to speak to or hear them in voice chat, and any trade or team invitations they send you will be ignored. Additionally, you will no longer appear on each other's maps, which will make it extremely difficult for the offending dweller to follow or find you again in the future."*
---
Though the game's built-in bounty system is meant as a way to deter griefers and harassment, there's no sure-fire way to stop it other than outright blocking the person. Thankfully, Fallout 76 only hosts about two dozen players in a world at any given time, so you won't be encountering a ton of different people."
---
Anyone know if Red Rocket robot helmet can be placed in display cases?
---
i miss having an invisible icon
---
It's meant to store a template of more than one item. Like, say you'd like to save a platform that had your basic crafting structures. You can save that as a template, then deploy that. You still have to have the building materials, or have the things that you're building with the template stored.
---
JE50cal looks like too
---
Damn it. Thanks.
---
Have you seen the points you get for your weeklies this week? Looks like some sort of gesture to make up for it...
---
I'm not sure if that could've been done. It all depends on whether Bethesda still has the licensing rights to use the songs from them. If they don't, then they'd have to re-acquire them to use in Fallout 76. 
---
That's the reason you don't hear certain songs in other titles. For example, you can hear the Jazz Interlude in only Fallout 3. Likewise, you can only hear The Wanderer in Fallout 4.
---
It's also the reason why there's no Elvis Presley music in New Vegas, despite The Kings being a direct reference to him. Bethesda couldn't afford the performance rights because of how costly it would've been.
---
Oh goodness this is quite the dilemma. I think there are 3 main contenders.
---
1. 50 cal machine gun (god roll = bloodied, ffr, fr (assuming you mean none explosive to discount a bloodied E fr, which is my pref with demo expert maxed out, and ignoring "magic effects")
---
Pros: fires fast and instant, cheap ammo, large magazine
---
cons: Can lose accuracy if firing over long periods
---
2. Gatling gun (bloodied ffr fr)
---
Pros: with ffr and speedy receiver you can tap the trigger to fire, or hold it down, great ammo economy, very cheap ammo, huge magazine, fast reload
---
cons: hard to hit moving enemies, annoying to fire over long periods
---
3. Minigun (bloodied ffr fr)
---
Pros: Cheap ammo, large magazine, great for firing at a boss over a long period
---
Cons: Has to spin up so less good for multiple weak targets
---
So there you go. I think the 50 cal is the overall winner. But it depends if you're against a boss you probably want the minigun, or if just casually farming the gatling. I carry all 3 (but as I said prefer explosive to ffr on my 50 cal).
---
Honorable mention to a primed LMG, but it's just got such low ammo reserve and it burns through ammo with it fast fire rate. Minigun does too to be fair but 5mm is super easy to craft and you find it everywhere, .308 much less so.
---
Purified water weighs 0.05 for me while inert flux weighs 0.2.
---
I've never experienced lag, then again I play on PC.
---
they're hardly op as it is. maybe with the upcoming nerf, but not right now.
---
people sell all sorts of gear, not just legacies. fixers are the most profitable apparently, and they're not legacy.
---
you're thinking of magic weapons, not legacy.
---
I started on a new console 3 weeks late. Have done all the dailies and weeklies aside from nuclear winter and I'm currently on 91. I don't agree it's shitty personally, the whole point is to reward people who play regularly. I don't get the logic that you should be able to get all the prizes without putting time into getting them, works the same with any other battle pass, not sure why this one should be any different. With that said, they obviously need to fix auto complete for next season as an absolute priority because that's punishing people who are putting the time in.
---
Yeah ☹️ it looks really cool, but it would be really nice if it offered some new songs
---
Use the converter. You need to use your phone and take a picture of how much of each ammo you have first, makes things way easier.
---
My dailies did yesterday. I was on at the time too. Now im not entirely sure but i think it let me actually do one even though they wouldve already been crossed off but im not sure because i didnt continue playing
---
I just wish they at least looked different
---
I having always pretty fun with Them. Strap some chameleon piece on. Search for (group) low levels and see Them searching the area of sometimes even firing at nothing.
---
Yes -- and also worth noting you can get a near god roll guaranteed if you complete Beckett's quest: it's an anti-armour, ffr, 250 dr while reload 50 cal.
---
Yes lol. They've been adding more and more obtainable Score the entire season, not just this week.
---
Hmm that's too bad, all I want is the porch. Thanks for the reply.
---
Exploitation is abuse of a bug. These effects are working as intended. 
---
Why are you so mad? Cant get a bloodied or junkies weapon?
---
No, I know that.... but still... it would be nice.
---
Me too i want that black t65 paint from the summer of trailer
---
As a late comer to the game I hope I can beat it. 89/100 right now.
---
sweet! now you can put up that Mr. Handy poster 😁
---
Where's the new clean bench at?
---
I wish we could get one that just plays Blues songs or even just Appalachia radio songs.
---
Oh wow, up til now I just haven't built it yet in my place... but that's one more reason NOT to. Same with magazine displays D:
---
I don't know how some people have such amazing CAMPs without hitting the cap...
---
No, I saw the text. As I noticed that by scorched beasts before I checked the body.
---
There is spread like a shotgun but it is more controlled when aiming down sights or in vats.
---
I don’t need enemy specific dmg because every enemy than isn’t SBQ or Earle goes down in 2-4 shots even if I don’t aim Grenades in 76 are just novelty items
---
super useful thank you,
---
Yess blues songs would be amazing
---
need more details.
---
At the atomic shop, for free.
---
It's the Fallout 1st item this month, over under the farthest tab to the right. The usual spot for the "free" stuff.
---
Thanks, is he the bartender? The one you rescue from a cell?
---
Add in the auto completed score and you got yourself a emergency patch in 3.....2...
---
Everything in the bunker floats.... Other events are spawning enemies outside of the bounties of that event... SBQ never lands/flies off... Tabbing menus in pipboy studder slow... Radio plays over itself... 
---
Did I mention the auto completion of SCORE and how it's the last week...forcing players to spend money instead of being rewarded for playing the game?
---
When it finally shows up, it's gonna be pretty sharp.
---
Meh i just bought it. I like classical radio anyways.
---
It's one of the few "roof decorations" we have.
---
Weathervanes would be a lovely addition at some point. 😋
---
correct. Great way to dip your toe in heavy guns. Also consider using PA -- there are two very good perks that require you to be wearing it.
---
The game being laggy has fuck all to do with legacy weapons and everything to do with ash piles, goo piles and even meat piles to some extent not disappearing and causing server issues. 
---
They're not really that OP, there are many weapons stronger than legacy. And they're also situational, and explosive modifier makes them break even faster so most of the time it's not even worth it. 
---
Legacies being taken out wouldn't do a damn thing to dupers or RMT. 
---
Doesn't put a bad image at all, and it doesn't take a legacy to ruin an event.
---
I can't place the new armor workbench anywhere. Anyone else with this problem? "overlap existing object"
---
Thanks for the great info, was wondering how all of this worked.
---
I need to level up to 300 to get that 6th card.
---
I'm thinking of lowering perks at 15 and making up the difference with legendary perks could be more flexible. For example lower STR from 15 to 10 when you get Legendary Strength to +5. Then you can put 3 in another SPECIAL and 2 in a different one. At the expense of wasting level ups moving SPECIAL points around.
---
Could also have nice benefits for nuclear winter players. My NW player has 15 agi but usually only uses 9 for frogs legs. Could lower this to 10 and put the points somewhere else. I assume NW only goes off your base SPECIAL.
---
I'm thinking infiltrator and leaving it at 1, poison resist left at 1, and 3 legendary perks to start with. Am also thinking of leveling an alt to 52 to use as a dedicated ammosmith as a rainy day project.
---
EMERGENCY PATCH?!? You act like there's people home.... they've all checked out.
---
I would rather that we configure it to play what we want :/
---
Unless the level 300 was fighting your dad while he was wearing the power armor, there’s no way for him to damage the power armor.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
Scroll down to the part about Damage Reduction Formula under Fallout 4 (the equation is also used by Fallout 76). It's a nonlinear relationship that's a little tough to wrap your head around, but a quick way to calculate it in your head is that if your damage is the same as the armor rating, the damage gets cut in half.
---
If it interests you, I made a spreadsheet a while ago that graphs damage reduction and effective health curves for various weapon damages. I originally did it to see if there's anything to the claim that you get massively diminishing returns above an armor rating of 450, turns out there's nothing magic about that number, especially against high damage attacks.

---
Doesn't the auto-completetion bug affects weeklies as well?
---
I don't know how increasing score points matters much when the bug is affecting said quests.
---
So is there nothing that helps in game is all use cosmetic stuff
---
Very well documented. Fall through the floor glitch. Stuck in the roof glitch “but his foot hangs out so you can still kill him” and the res pawn bug.
---
Same with buying clothing and skins. They auto equip for nuclear winter, and while I’m not a huge fan of the game mode, when I play it, I want the outfit I set up, not some hodge lodge of random clothing.
---
check angryturtle video on magic weapons. essentially some legendary effects (like 33%) are bugged on high rate of fire weapons and deal insane damage under the right circumstances.
---
I know it's not the point but can you not just repair it?
---
they took over his workshop, which is fine I guess, I think it's kind of a dick move to take a workshop off a low level player but you're within your right to to it ig. but while he was lying on the ground waiting to respawn, they fuckin pumped him full of lead which completely fucked his power armour.
---
i can't see any real justification for this other than being a cunt. he was really upset.
---
Bethesda will most likely see this and say “compensation? You’re right. Enjoy these 100 atom points. On us. “
---
Were you expecting them to either never ever add more PA to the game or that  they'd just give you freebies every single time they add a new set?
---
You bought a specific pack of PA skins.  You got those exact PA skins.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  Stop trying to act like Bethesda is cheating you out of your money/atoms because they keep adding stuff to the game.
---
That’s Genius! 
---
Here have a Nobel prize..
---
I’m also now going to photograph the levels you can scrap the most common ammo at so I can save it up and just do 1 quick sale.
---
Already have a few memorized... 30 missiles = converter visit

While I like that everyone has good comments about the discussion, I would like to hear more from solo players like myself. The way the game is mainly set up as a team play world. The only perk card for solo play is Lone Wanderer. I myself, would like to see some balance between being able to play solo and have as many perks as team play. Most of charisma is set for team benefit and little else, balance it out and give some perks for solo play and random encounters. I would say to have a way to set up the private servers, of course they can't do this on public servers, but, it's a way to let the owner determine difficulty from say "push over" to "savage hardcore".  Wouldn't that bring more balance for new players and solo players? Your ideas?
---
they claimed his workshop which initiated pvp
---
That would be an interesting design!
---
Whatever. Your still trying to put your view on everyone else. And yeah I guess I was right about you being a bloodied build.
---
That's why you compensate them with another item that has similar value but not broken instead of letting the game be imbalanced for others.
---
no , i was talking about for example explosive plazma Gatling. You dont need "magic" what can be fixed. These weapons are still OP update after update and can tear every npc in game with huge radius. Dont need even aim.
---
I figured, I just wanted to make it more known
---
he's trying but struggling to find enough materials. regardless it's a huge pain in the ass and he was pretty upset.
---
No I stopped playing and stopped giving them money. I just show up every Tuesday to see if they actually fix anything and give me a reason to play again.
---
Thanks, but I did mention I already have a Bloodied Power Fist, a really nice player gave it to me for free. Love this community.
---
Laundry day is a dangerous, dangerous day in Appalachia.
---
Samuel in Foundation does the same thing.
---
🧂🧂🧂
---
If I could only get the white wolf Fedora my life would be complete
---
They must have known players have been crying out for new music.  Even if it's stuff already in game like the one at son of Danes and there is another one I forget too.
---
That classical one is just trash.  I listen to the  classical radio a lot.  But that jukebox has like one or 2 songs only. 
---
Disappointing. I always wait for these posts before buying newly released items.  There is always a bug or a catch with it.
---
I want that jazzy tune that I hear at various jukeboxes and the banjo one from One Violent Night
---
Everytime i forget im not in power armor anymore, ill be either wondering why the animation to exit it hasn't started or straight up jumping off the cliff next to my base.
---
oh im sorry its backwards
---
its just weird to end a season before a patch.
---
I have 200 of them....want one?
---
damn right I'm salty
---
Just put my down with no problems.
---
Yeah! It would be cool to find a small warehouse that they added that offered a Nuka Bottling machine. Would be cool. Could have the same production rate to the food packing plant.
---
Well, workshops are the only place where people can fight other players without receiving a bounty. 
---
Workshops are never safe. And it doesn’t matter if you have pacifist or not so tell your dad to be careful and keep an eye out if other players show up. 
---
My gf was minding her own business and she got killed in the workshop as well. Sure I went and took care of it and killed him a few times. But my gf was also unaware that you can and will get killed in a workshop if other people decide to take over it.
---
I built my camp in front of West Tek down the road. I do a little circuit up the road and end it here. Always some interesting battles going on. The last one was a Sentry bot vs Super Mutants
---
Thanks for the info! 
---
Pretty bummed that they are removing the armor set perks. Most of everything that's left seems mediocre. Probably just gonna do stat bonuses now with ammo crafting on one character and follow through on a commando. Are the drugs from brawling chemist at least tradable?
---
I bought it and hate it. Looks really shitty if you don't have a super bit of flat land to put it on, like the golf course... but why would a log cabin be on a golf course it should be out in the mountains, but nah looks a mess.
---
And how would that be arranged?  Who decides what is a ‘similar value’?
---
Ash and meat piles have more impact on lag that anything else. These weapons aren’t as ‘OP’ as some players think.  And they weren’t the only thing duped. 
---
It’s a PR quagmire. There is no simple fix.
---
i think he will now, it's just so infuriating that people are assholes. even being killed, just,,, why wreck his power armour other than to be a dick??
---
work shops are known PVP zones sorry to hear though
---
IE90 LMG for 1200 caps
---
Not who you asked but mine is lvl 50
---
I already have the mod, it's pretty awesome! Only reason I made this post was because I expected the endgame weapons to somehow be op, but I guess not. lol
---
VPNs have nothing to do with this.  Bethesda literally is doing little to nothing about it.  Their anti-cheat has changed minimally in last couple of years.  I'm one of the people who has updated said hacks in the past
---
Sometimes he can be a lazy, good for nothing trickster..
---
Ooo...a Brahmin would be awesome!! Traveling milk farm :)
---
If you decide not to respawn and are in PA, your power armour still takes durability loss while you are dead on the ground. 
---
Give up the junk if you're already dead. PA dura can cost a lot to fix for a new player.
---
They're really giving up on this game aren't they. The money making parts of the game, Atomic Shop and Fallout 1st. Ones just constantly recycled stuff and the other gets nothing. It's a shame. If they sorted camp budget out and introduced actually good brand new content for the Atomic Shop, I'd legit buy stuff with real money. Oh well.
---
I mean, give us camp objects that are already in the fucking game? There's a ton of stuff in the map thats already made that they could put in. The only thing I look forward to in this game now is curiosity with whatll be in the Atomic Shop every Tuesday. Everytime it's just one section that's mediocre new things, then the rest of the pages are recycled crap. Camp building and editing is the only Endgame and look how it's treated. Meh.
---
Bethesda posted about it being tomorrow
---
This grumpy old man agrees with the other grumpy old men, that when an icon is auto applied it just makes all the grumpy old men grumpier.
---
I find it soothing. Options would always be nice though.
---
That 18k SCORE I just lost is like if I dropped every flux I ever had and a lvl 3 scooped it up and then faded into the backwoods of Appalachia.
---
&gt; The free radicals one, the one that Big Al's tattoo and the one in the nuclear winter lobby all exist and are way better than the ones we have but Bethesda can't be bothered and try to sell us a reskin of the shitty one that we all hate. 
---
Literally This.
---
The assets for it are already in the game, but it's not being made available to us. 
---
It's like looking through a garage made of glass: You can see a new sports car inside, ready to be driven. Except somebody locked the garage door and they don't feel like opening it.
---
Yeah, the new daily dungeons that they plan to introduce with update 22. You'll get ammunition you used to kill the mobs from every mob there. Even the ultracite ammo. Just like you do at colossal problem rn. I tested it on pts and went out with *much* more fuel than what I went in with.
---
That’s good. Maybe I’ll start another character and give it another shot. Hopefully I’ll have better luck.
---
legacy gatling plasmas perform nowhere near as well as magic weapons.
---
legacies, gatling plasma included, are high maintenance, prone to blowing up in your face and don't perform particularly better than regular weapons.
---
most of them can dispatch trash mobs just as efficiently and a gauss minigun for example might perform even better than a legacy gatling plasma during boss fights. without killing you in the process or breaking multiple times.
---
and speaking of the gatling plasma specifically, I was using one last night and swear they nerfed the splash damage. used to be I could just aim wherever and kill everything but yesterday it took a couple well-placed volleys to kill a level 45 scorched during scorched earth. something's definitely up.
---
good advice, it's a shame he didn't know. I was also under the impression that the high level weapon managed to do damage fast
---
They mentioned there would be a gap between seasons back when they were amounted. Thank goodness too, I could use a breather
---
If you're on Xbox I might be able to help.
---
Has it ever affected you? 
---
It hasn't for me. Never had the bug once. I know it has affected some people though, but how many %? I believe the number is small and doesn't happen every day/week.
---
In the beginning, there were iirc only 7 dailies a day. Today, I see 9. It has been more than 7 dailies a day for at least a month. That's a lot of extra score.
---
This is just one of the changes they made to add more opportunities to get score.
---
It would be nice if I could finally finish the inoculation quest so I could access the story.
---
Did you abuse a glitch that increases your ammo capicity?
---
sigh, if only people weren't assholes. wishful thinking I guess
---
Damn almost like what I’m saying is what over half the 76 players do and think lmao you’re just mad it takes you more than one shot to kill a lvl 1 ghoul 😂😂
---
Apparently the bug was that the level of the weapon scaled with the map zone that your camp was in, so if you do make sure you are camped somewhere on the right side of the map just to be sure
---
he's on pc unfortunately, but it's nice of you to offer, thank you
---
2 Neon Letters and Signs for 2000 each. Bought them both, 1 on each of my main characters.
---
Just bin it off, power armour sucks anyways .
---
Sorry to hear this happened. You always run a risk of PvP in workshops but still a pretty shitty thing to do to fk up the PA post kill. What platform are you on?
---
Either that or a card that increases the legendary scrip I can get each day...I swear my stash is like 85% legendary stuff I can’t get rid of. I’d sell it but who really wants an 2* trouble shooters pipe wrench?!?
---
Yes it has, it has affected all my dailies 3 times. It hasn't happened to my weeklies even though i heard from others that it has effected them every day.  
---
Take a look at this post.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iko2o2/bethesda\_double\_score\_week\_and\_all\_of\_my\_daily/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iko2o2/bethesda_double_score_week_and_all_of_my_daily/)
---
Not a problem.
---
your last sentence is literally exactly what theyre doing
---
Fuck that guy. IDGAF what everyone says, the only assholes initiating PvPenis at this point are dicks who do shit like that. You should not have to pay for first if you want to claim and build a workshop without having to deal with a high level cromag who would purposely wreck armor or perk up the workshop demo card on a significantly lower level.
---
I am all for a fun, fair workshop fight with an adequately leveled player. And unless they are being a fuckstick, I'd never purposely wreck their armor. You have to earn that right with a decent player.
---
Getting to play with older/younger family members is super fun and it really pisses me off to see posts like this where some twatwaffle ruined their experience. I empathize with your situation bud, sorry you encountered such a douche.
---
What system you guys on?
---
Of course it did. I’m pretty sure I was still camped in the Forrest at that point. I’ve moved into the savage divide since. I’ll keep that tip in mind if I give it another go, thank you.
---
facts 😂😂
---
And that totally makes sense ..... in all my life I have never ever come across a jukebox that only played classical music, Beth just makes me laugh they can hit a hole in one on some things and then just way out of touch on other sometimes very basic things...
---
Lol. Man you are lame. 
---
Anyone who exaggerated and professes to know what people think means one thing. You are wrong and your making things up to try and hide that. 
---
So have fun with your bloodied build delusions.
---
Oh dude I’m constantly toggling those off and on it drives me nuts
---
If aiming it's not that bad but shoot the ground without aiming and you will see the spread one goes left and the other will go the opposite. Its easier to notice on lasers
---
TIL People shoot their CAMP floor decor
---
that's really sweet, thank you. dickheads will always exist unfortunately
---
pc
---
Oh, fuel works? I heard a few ammo types didn't work and haven't tried my heavy guy yet. That's good to know
---
Hadn't thought about that, no black bird or nukashine option for me. Guess now we know if they do get added then now they'll be sold separately. Luckily the four horsemen skins work.
---
damn. was gonna offer to jump on and help out.
---
as someone who hates pa myself I've been trying to advise against it, alas he is too stubborn
---
I skipped like ~2-3 weeks around the start of the season, but managed to hit 100 today. Must've had a LOT of those +100 score xp challenges done. I did however get the level up daily more often that not and did any NW that were place camp or take photo.
---
that's really kind of you, I appreciate it.
---
Aight, DM on here with your dads gamer tag and I’ll hit him up with the missing junk needed for repair.
---
Camo t65 lets you make Jetpack Arms.
---
Yeah me too , im rank 97 i know its done this week , but the last 2 weeks have felt like a job.
---
no prob
---
Dude you’re amazing!
---
It will come back half price at some point.
---
If it was say ONE thing, delayed ONCE, and it launched bug FREE maybe even every six months, I could agree with you.
---
But its damn near everything that gets pushed back multiple times and still brings in a whole slue of issues. Even the repeat content from last year is somehow late and buggy. They have made a routine of being late and short, and people are rightly tired of it. I'm glad you're still happy with it, maybe some day they will put a lot more effort in and the rest of us can be happy too.
---
- Ran through a silo and forgot the nuclear keycard
---
- Tried to fight a Scorchbeast at level 30
---
- Tried fighting an Assaultron with a melee weapon (level 15 fire axe)
---
Honestly the wastlanders weapons are almost as good as legacy's.they are laser weapons with explosive damage and they melt shit just as fast if not faster than a gatling explosive plasma.several vids out on this showing legacy's aren't the end all be all.
---
Pretty much, yeah. You can get fun cosmetic beds, musical instruments, and things like that- but it's purely cosmetic, and you can earn different types of those items in-game for free. Only real exception there is outfits, since most of the ones in the atom shop cannot be found in game. But there is nothing to give you an advantage over other players in the atom shop, no.
---
They will. And I'm sorry to see the "wOrKshOpz r 4 pVp" diatribe here in the comments. Yeah, no shit. You're rightfully venting! I see you're on PC, I wish I could help but I'm on console. 
---
Hoping you guys still enjoy your time, I'm always so happy to see kids/parents getting to play together! :-)
---
If you got Fallout 1st
---
Finally!!  The contemporary set.
---
I play a minimum of 2 hrs every day that I can, which is usually 7 days a week. By no means would I consider myself a casual player. Im not asking to earn all of the rewards after playing only a few days a week. Being denied the final and only decent reward when I have essentially an 85% attendance (in terms of days) is a kick in the dick. Im happy you were able to progress despite your delay. Not sure how there is such a gap between myself and you.
---
I guess next season I will just have to tell the wife to F off when she asks for a date night.
---
Lmao go off about how your frag grenades are better than a BE .50 cal tho idk how you haven’t seen a frag bag before it’s impossible to play this broke ass game without finding one cuz grenades ain’t good idk why you are fan boying over throwables
---
I ended up coughing up atoms for the last two ranks, although I would have held off if I had known it was ending next week maybe
---
i just told him about the offer and he said he just managed to gather up enough to repair it, but he appreciates it. he's usually not one for accepting things off of other people anyways haha
---
Blah blah blah. More stupid opinions.
---
I heard that it was 5 coins per rank on a card now
---
thank you :)
---
where's the Fortnite default skin?
---
No? It's permanent
---
It’s a permeant part of the game.
---
At this time I just wish Beth did SOMETHING for the camp budget, my comic shop is not big at all, but displaying all magazines, bobbles, Mr Fuzzys,Teddies, hologames and movie/game related stuff my camp is maxed out to the tiniest detail, and Beth keeps putting stuff up all this week in the store I've been waiting to grab but can't put them out until a budget increase happens, I go to some peoples camps and they seem to have f\*\*king loads of stuff.
---
that's a terrible idea for several reasons. people say that 'nothing has value anymore', but someone with dozens of legacies could ask for an entire armory of still untouched weapons and armor. why do you think perfect leather and metal pieces are so expensive? I have a couple fixer and .45 smgs people offered me entire inventories for, because they're unique.
---
and that's just one example. someone may also simply not want their legacy gone. on top of them hardly being 'imbalanced'.
---
I swear people get legacies and magic weapons confused. yeah, blowing yourself to high heaven in enclosed spaces and having to fix your gun multiple times during boss fights sure is op. all the while my handmade fares better.
---
Hmm.  I’ll 2x check next time I’m on, verify my perks, etc.  I know I have 20% Aid item WR armor, not sure what level thru-hiker.  I know I do not have grocer backpack.
---
Only got 3 levels to go and it looks like challenges rewards are doubled this week.
---
Yeah I understand that, I’m very much the same. Happy to hear he got the stuff together that he needed. Hope this experience doesn’t dampen his enjoyment of the game too much.
---
The stacking of effects is absolutely not intended. The magic weapons are not intended.
---
Lol, no, I don't play with that shit. It's fucking ridiculous.
---
Admittedly, Im terrible at leveling up and gaining EXP. I tried a few of the NW challenges, but felt like I was force feeding myself a shit sandwich. I just couldnt do it.
---
The critical challenge has me kicking myself. Such an easy challenge, but I somehow fumbled through 90% of the game not knowing how to crit lol. Dumb move on my part.
---
Not even close. That was never a thing.
---
Mine was level 50.
---
Why change the weapon out completely instead of simply modifying how the explosive effect works on energy weapons to be more balanced?  That’s what they originally said they would work on.
---
I've been hoping the hunters pelt outfit or something similar would come around sooner or later
---
Earletron, assemble!
---
Is it too much to ask for the devs to deliver the content as scheduled with little to no bugs?  I mean why should we settle for either content full of bugs or content thats been delayed 2 weeks that only has a handful of bugs?
---
The jukebox in the nukashine bar plays better music, they have the technology to make it happen... why won’t they make it happen.
---
They are not devs but "managers", glorified messengers between Beth and the playerbase.
---
Those Elvis rights owners are really greedy.  And how often do you even hear it anymore?  Gen Z probably never heard it.
---
Somebody tag a dev FFS
---
We need this implemented 6 months ago.
---
Kinda funny that all of my daily and weekly challenges auto completed today.
---
On my rooftop deck in my crafting area.
---
You realize yours is also an opinion that can be seen as stupid by a lot of people
---
I'd rather them give us some sort of animation on using these items. Who likes just tapping A or X or... Whatever PC uses.. To just see a bar go up and that's it?
---
Instead of taking away the survival elements, make them feel more natural. Say I eat some Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, it'd be cool to see my guy hold a box up and eat out of it. Or if he goes to eat a piece of meat, just make your guy pull out a steak and chomp a couple bites and you're good.
---
But this is probably way too complicated for most people to enjoy I suppose. Maybe if they added something that works like our punch bowls and nuka machines. Let us stock our excess meats in something that helps the spoil rate and allows anyone to walk up and hit a button to get some food with no menu's needed.
---
I just feel there's far better ideas than just scrapping the hunger/thirst mechanic. Whether giving it new life with animations, options to streamline it with C.A.M.P. items, or some other great idea I can't think of that someone else did. Just... Something other than scrapping it. I feel scrapping it is a form of giving up and I personally do not like giving up. Otherwise, I wouldn't still be playing this game with all the shit we've had to endure since beta/launch.
---
Absolutely not intended? How do you know that? And to your next point do you leave ACP groups when junkie or bloodied players are carrying your food build ass?
---
Wait the collectron is only available from the 4th - 7th? Fuuuuuuuuuuuck I'm moving and cant access it. That's the main thing I wanted.
---
I can’t see why people do, less perks to choose from
---
And it’s actually got lesss Carry weight than my unyielding setup
---
I didn't know if maybe they released stuff that help with food going off rather than an advantage over other player. I have no interest in the pvp side of the game.
---
Watched a low level accidentally walk off the ledge of the cliff where my camp is and get downed. Followed him to revive and got downed next to him. Forgot I rely on my buddy to share goat legs but he wasn't playing at the time. 🤪
---
That's awesome!
---
Fell off a cliff and died trying to shoot a cargobot down, followed by shooting something I didn't check first--aggroing a legendary 33 wendigo at 14 was a poor choice.
---
Lmao it should be
---
Im not even suprised i feel bad for anyone bethesda tricked into buying it
---
This looks so spooky!
---
Thank you very much! It's one of the first digital pieces I'm proud of!
---
One time i picked the free one and it didn't automatically equip. But the next time i didn't check and it did! *confused screaming*
---
Magical rolled weapons deal extra damage, getting to the root it seemed to be something on the backend that was to reduce rubberbanding on explosives and high fire rate weapons but glitched certain prefixes. The magic shotguns I have not found anything solid on why if in vats all pellets hit and do card damage but it too could have something to do with the rubberbanding fix.   
---
Latency also plays a role in; if it counts damage extra times however there is no real consistency proving that assumption.   
---
Right now, angry turtle as mentioned has a solid video but he missed a few points. A TS FFR gauss minigun (has a fire rate of 143 which also proves it is less than 180 needed for magic) for example with the penta barrel is magic but with the tri barrel (132 speed) it is not you still need a piece of magic armor to make it work though, I shredded ACP is 1:15  and 1250 rounds to use as an example. I have video I clipped from xbox showing a mirelurk queen dead in 1.5 seconds.   
---
With that minigun you own it would be magic without the the armor piece making it useable in PA, as 33% is one of the bugged prefixes. Personally I found bashing to be more reliable though for magic damage as you may need to server hop to get junkies or 33 to work consistently. My personal goal is to find a TS FFR minigun and see how it handles on earle, but alas I just can not seem to find one or anyone willing to trade for one.   
---
So in PA weapon needs magical prefix, in armor you should wear a +15% blocking and get better prefixes so all high fire rate and shottys are magical.   
---
While it is a bug, since it spreads across so many weapons this would not be an exploit but a unintentional feature until they somehow fix it and then make other weapons OP by accident.
---
I have a friend who is probably the most hyped person in the world for Cyberpunk 2077. The first time it was delayed he said he wished it would just go ahead and release even if it was a broken mess and that they could just fix it later. I just told him he was an idiot.
---
HERE I’M WAITING SO THEY CAN ADD THE VAULT TEC FLAMER SKIN BACK PLS TODD BRING IT BACK I WANT IT FOR MY FLAMER
---
Damn, well I guess everybody knows about it now. It's only been a drop for those rare items since wasteland is released so don't feel too bad about it. I've been grinding out that location for ages.
---
When they had other actors play him in Supernatural, it just didn't feel like it was Lucifer
---
This is my secret place stop sharing it
---
I mean do we even look at other people's bobblehead?
---
Nope. We don't care.
---
It's permanent
---
we're getting a ton of stuff, relatively speaking. for most of its lifespam, Fo1sters got absolutely nothing.
---
not saying it's a good thing. just saying.
---
that'll be 5000 atoms plus tip
---
Where do I go
---
You don’t need an asshole when you are an asshole.
---
Either your build sucks, your gear sucks, or both suck
---
Not as polite as I could maybe have been? But those are really the only 2 things it could be
---
Edit, https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Go there and let us see your build. It also helps to know what kind of guns and such you are using
---
it's not that simple. I'm the first to criticize Bethesda but explosive energy weapons have been an issue with the engine since Fo4. one that not even modders could properly fix.
---
so it's safe to say Bethesda is never fixing it.
---
Have you gone to a Tinkers Workbench and looked under souvenirs?
---
Idk where to go to donate
---
Did you look in your buildable camp items
---
This is rediculous, 15$ for a bundle of skins?? Will this ever end?
---
You can enable remote access on Xbox with a Windows computer.  Otherwise you could try remote access to login to FO76 on PC.
---
I was helping some lower level players, taking them to map spots. We were in the Cranberry Bog. I had just warned them to avoid fissure sites because falling in was certain death and they would lose any junk they might be carrying. Proceeded to fall into a fissure site.
---
It must suck to be an unrefined swine.
---
Do the legendary special perks count towards the nuclear winter requirement?
---
Meh. Whatever. Pay for it or don't.
---
The only computer I got is a cheap laptop I bought for school I think it'd crash from me just thinking about putting fallout 76 on it
---
To be fair people sell missiles, 40mm, and mini nukes for way to much when they do. Its pretty insulting to see someone throw something you know they want rid of in they're vendors 25+ caps for a single round. 
---
I doubt very many many people would buy 5.56 or .308 for 25 caps per round. If it's cheap enough I'll clean out every vendor though
---
Yeah, I'm only level 6 in NW so it goes to show how very little I played it (or just how fast I would lose, lol, only managed to win one).
---
For XP, I would always rush to the cranberry bog workshop with the super mutants, clean house, claim workshop, finish defense event, then swap servers and do it again. Usually got me the level up pretty quick with unyielding armor and well rested. Then sell the guns to vendor for most of the daily stock of caps. 
---
I too skipped one critical weekly cause of the same reason. Criting feels to weird in this game too at least for melee. Half the time I press to crit it doesn't use up my bar (I think it's cause you need to be in range to initiate the crit unlike ranged weapons but maybe it's just lag).
---
I think the pass could've been more forgiving but it wasn't as daunting as I thought it'd be first going into it. I wish they would just scrap the NW challenges and have weeklies only - no dailies (with the weeklies adjusted to give as much score as having done all the dailies, but harder/lengthier than current weeklies are).
---
The little alligator looking one, I forget his name. LOL
---
There have actually been a few FO1st exclusive discounts but the Atomic Shop doesn’t really tell you that they are. Albeit, the discounted items aren’t particularly flashy or insanely reduced in price. 
---
I nevertheless agree as there should be more goodies for something being paid for on a subscription basis.
---
Yeah its a joke if you ask me. I would honestly be delighted with 1 really good outfit a month.
---
Its funny because if they had all of their stuff available on the store I would literally spend a small fortune! This whole russian roulette of drips and drabs is driving me nuts. I get the logic, its meant to drive scarcity sales, but it just prevents me spending just incase next weeks stuff is a better investment.
---
I can't tell you how many legendary bodies I've lost there because of exploding vehicles.
---
That's possibly the dumbest question I've seen on Reddit today. 
---
To respond to the OP, I have the same issue and it seems to be an ongoing glitch with chained hit calculations. Those calculations are seemingly persistent at the moment so very quickly you can overwhelm the client on your machine and drop you to single digits frame rate. I'd love to see some kind of update from BGS about it, but for now I've just had to put my "Proton Pack" up on the wall.
---
How about a general weight reduction legendary perk?
---
good point
---
Just imagine if you had finished the run a week and a half ago....
---
Pretty much. This.
---
Oh i got that one yesterday, it wasn't any other in the weekend?
---
Yeah, its entirely your choice! The wonders of the free states! :D
---
Not even. Just all perks. Reached 4500 today
---
It's been a while since I played but any decent level fifty build should be fine with enemies up to its level, or even higher in most cases
---
I finished it last week and have shelved the game since because there really isn't anything to do at this point.
---
Welp, on the other hand, I'd be using up one Legendary perk slot instead of common ones then... so there is that.
---
It wasn't an event?
---
Sold individually? I don’t believe so. The Grelok(sp) guy but I believe he’s still available
---
I'm just about to donate 7000 cloth from my scrap box.
---
28 boxes, not a single unknown plan.
---
Well excuse me. I pvp alot and get this most commonly when my enemy uses such a glitched Tesla rifle. There aren't any stupid question.
---
making the entire catalogue available to Fo1st members is actually a great idea and I don't see any obvious drawbacks. if anything it could drive up the number of one-time purchases.
---
This doesn’t make any sense even if it were remotely true.
---
Same with outfits (NW) and bags.
---
They had the alien and the bunny too.
---
One of the developers is getting mad props for making a player icon so popular half the player base is immediately using it.
---
All I know is I like first since I was buying atoms every month anyways, the perks like the tent and scrap box more than make up the freebies to me.
---
Ehhhhhhhh?? What items? I've never seen anything!
---
Yeah definitely. Its great that they are doing the season now which is free for everyone, but part of me feels like they are completely forgetting about those who are consistently funding the game. Yeah you get a decent amount of atoms, but that costs them literally nothing and grants them security of a constant income. The scrap box? Yeah its amazing but it should be available to everyone in the first place
---
If the "effective firerate" of a weapon is 100 or higher certain legendary effects will make the guns kill a lot faster when you consistently hit a target 
---
Basically that minigun causes the game to register hits that didn't happen, I have an lmg with almost the same role and it causes scorchbeasts to evaporate
---
Maxing rep was all I had left and I’m done on my main, and have maybe 2 or 3 dailies of worth of rep left for the settlers on my alt
---
That's exactly what I do, but Lord, it seems a little ridiculous that it's necessary!
---
UPDATE: Bethesda actually responded to my ticket very quickly, however, they said they can't adjust my S.C.O.R.E. or rank (I was not asking for this).  They also said there is absolutely nothing they can do, like resetting the challenges back to uncompleted, which is all I wanted.
---
They did give me a hopeful suggestion at the end of the ticket response, they said if it happens again to please submit another ticket, which of course will get the same response.
---
If I had all the weeklies, dailies, and gained about 15 levels this week I could have completed the season.  But with all my weeklies and today's dailies already wiped out it is a no-go.  It's my own fault, I didn't get back into 76 until a few weeks ago, so I started behind.
---
It does make me regret getting Fallout 1st.  I am happy to support the developers buying the game, but this is my first ticket and request for help and they responded with "Sorry, but there is nothing we will do for you, even though this is a problem on our end."
---
Those buns need a hotdog!
---
Their ability is not in question. It’s the prudence of the action they choose to take that is the concern.
---
I’ve spent a lot of time vendor hopping but had no god-rolls that people are talking about. The best was a suppressor’s explosive +250 DR while reloading combat shotgun. Found it for 850 caps and resold it for 5k. Easy money 😎
---
No, they don't affect your Nuclear Winter SPECIAL.
---
Plays same music as the regular one does. Has no animations to it. The neon light doesn't flicker. When you turn it on, it plays the same "arm" sound the regular one does only you don't see the arm move an pick up a holotape. It's just bleh.
---
What if they gave us a placeable RV with a built in station, matching the one in the show?
---
I still don’t understand why Bethesda didn’t just find a balancing workaround. They pour so much time into altering certain things and then just keep others as bugged legacies or op magic weapons.
---
That isn't how two shot works, or has ever worked
---
There has to be something they can do for people who finish early.  I finished about a week and a 1/2 ago and have barely logged in since. 
---
 I ran the colossus event a couple times on my private server but other than that I haven't really played at all.
---
It really wasn't, people grinded it out much earlier than that.
---
Great thanks.
---
The best kept secret from this person was how to turn off quests.
---
2 shot causes you to fire two projectiles, the second doing less damage than the first (pretty sure it's a percentage), both projectiles will have the same accuracy stat but they will "hit" in different locations 
---
If your gun has high accuracy this is barely noticeable on body shots
---
I actually found a fancy pump-action shotgun 15k but sadly I only had 11k caps at the time  and the guy logged off pretty soon after I saw it and I can’t remember his gamertag for the life of me even tho I can afford it now 😞
---
I dropped the atoms since this one didnt mention the radio station it played in the description. Put in a request for refund, i'll report back if I get one but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I'll take a bed and skin for the armor workbench over another texture for the same stupid outfit we got for months on end last year. Plus we actually get exclusive discounts now even if they aren't labelled. Now the atom shop updates on the other hand have been terrible since the Legendary Run started which means there's not much worth spending those First atoms on these days.
---
Yeah the atoms are nice but that costs them nothing and they get the security of a constant income in return. 1st members are the bread and butter of their income yet, I can't help but feel they forget about us. Seasons are great, but thats free for everyone (which is amazing!)
---
The first time I ran into this issue at someone’s camp I was totally confused lol...I went around the garage looking inside and could see the vendors were in there but the door was locked and the pull up door was down and like a noob I didn’t realize all I had to do was walk up to it to interact! Still annoying
---
For example last week, the Responders Power Armor Set was slightly discounted for FO1st members only and there are also items exclusively for members to purchase that week. 
---
Here is the link for you to have a look for yourself: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5tjdMr2c4yv1LiPVrVLWOG/atomic-shop-weekly-update-august-25-september-1
---
I don't remember what they sold on which day but they had the Conan looking one, the bunny, the alligator, Mr pebbles, a guy in a trench coat, alien, and a little sheepsquatch
---
Where is my Olive-green Chinese Power Armor Jetpack skin??
---
Bethesda please...
---
Was excited about the vertibird power armor but it's just a camo paint...........super disappointed
---
Had a guy die in my camp to a spike trap, quick looted the bag before realising it has more junk than my character or stash could hold, spent 10 minutes transferring and selling junk to make space
---
All came up for sale this past weekend? Luckily I already have them all but my brother is going to be pissed when he hears about that. LOL
---
This grumpy old gal is in agreement.
---
covert some , sell some for a dime and dump a part for newbies
---
Oh nice! Does it place easily on a roof? Angled or flat? Looks like the only thing I would like for my camp
---
I think it was the sheepsquatch, the rabbit and the alien.
---
Chinese Communist style skin for the LMG
---
Because i believe that the LMG = Chinese Light machine gun!
---
Except they did it to the legendary masks
---
In terms of things like that then, it's all earned in-game. The turbo-fert device from the Settlers helps with your crops, and the refrigerated backpack mod helps your food spoil **way** slower, and is earned through the tadpole scouts quest. The atom shop just offers cool skins for that backpack, or floor-design options and stuff like that for the camp.
---
I guess I am easier to please? I love the look of the new armor workbench. I am more hoping they pull something more shiffty like a unique chem lab or tinker bench though.   
---
Like I said it just made financial sense to spend on first what I spend normally on atoms anyways, so I guess what I am saying is 1st and its perks are a bonus to me and not the atoms, but I could see where people that normally didn't spend cash for atoms would want a little more love for the first program.
---
It was one per day, except the trench coat guy seemed to be all week, oh and they had a new one like a wizard that stayed longer
---
At least he died with his best friend
---
Ok I feel a lot better about spending the atoms now, thanks.
---
Convert anything players won't use, stuff like 5.56 and 5mm are the lifeblood of the game though. 
---
Flamer fuel, .45 acp, .50 and .308 are also good to sell
---
I can’t wait to tell him he missed Grognak....again, LOL
---
I sold my vats unknown blaster it didn’t do crap
---
Two shot gives the weapon an addition 25% damage bonus but the overall damage is split between the two shots. so a normal hunting rifle might do 50 per bullet. A two shot version would do 62.5 damage split over two bullets (each doing 31.25 damage). Two shot is usually better for tight spread or automatic weapons where chance of missing is low.,
---
Weekly dailies would help significantly. Being able to take a break from the game without lagging behind too far seems like a no-brainer to me.
---
I will have to give that Cranberry Bog workshop a try. Maybe I can do a little more catching up!
---
It's wonky because they don't actually show you the discount, but if you compare what price you see versus what a non fo1 player sees in the store your price will be lower.
---
Like most everything else in the game it's poorly executed or just works depending on what  you're smoking.
---
Isn’t that one of the cards that’s causing earl to fall through the floor at times though?
---
I drink it
---
I am too lol. I wanted the bunny and the little sheep one 😭 i feel for your brother 😅
---
Oh nooo 😂😂 poor guy!! The good news is that they will bring him back eventually. Hopefully your bro gets him the next time haha
---
Awesome work
---
Perhaps I am the one who is hard to please! Haha. I just wanted to see what everyone elses stance was! I completely see how it works out in your favour. How are you finding the atomic shop content they have been releasing?
---
Well that makes no sense. Nuclear winter special was based on your special points in adventure. If they go up from legendary special perks, why are they not counted?
---
I used to see it for sale on occasion but havent seen it in awhile, I dont even find it in bags or suitcases anymore.
---
Wym? I love getting 5fps during that event.
---
This reminds me of a saying...
---
"Shit in one hand, and wish in the other, and see which fills up first."
---
Wish.com
---
Camo or a Clandestine Service paint for the .45 SMG!
---
PLEASE BETH!
---
Oh i got to see the alien but not the 2 i wanted lol. What A bad luck of mine. Thanks for answering!
---
I like your style Tryin to make a change :-\
---
When you kill him, the event is over, yes. Then it starts again when someone launches another nuke.
---
Exactly like when people kill the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
i tried politely explaining this to two people who ruined the event yesterday.
---
they told me i started the holocaust 
---
:(
---
I might've had you beat didn't clock it 🤣. Gotta love this game can't even use weapons they give ya
---
Is there anyone that didn't start really late that isn't long done?  Even just picking the low hanging ones like "join a group", "take a picture", "build 5 floor mats", "buy 3 bullets, 1 at a time" should have gotten you done by now.
---
Sounds good.  I’ll stick with sniping for now since I don’t even have heavy guns yet.
---
Oh that's where the bug comes from... huh
---
Mannequins are going to be an armor ace reward. No atoms needed unless you’re wanting to spend them on jumping through the board early on
---
I literally saw cthulhu in those ash piles. While being at 10 fps.
---
Because Legendary Perks are not equipped during Nuclear Winter, and THOSE are what boost your SPECIAL.
---
level is this game doesn't really matter for a whole lot beyond, HP and perks / equipment allowed. It's all about the gear and perk setup.  
---
make sure you're using all of the perks related to a specific weapon group, so common Expert, and Master versions. and Depending on your weapon of choice use perks like Tank Killer, Glow Sighted, Bloody Mess, Stabilizer, etc.
---
Take a look online at some builds based on weapon types as well as make sure you're using the highest level version of the  weapon you can, look for legendary versions if possible.
---
Yup. The delays are the big unknown
---
We can paint ANYTHING in real life. Let me paint EVERYTHING in my game!
---
If you have ~350 dr/er without barbarian 3, then skip it for expert slugger 2 and master slugger 1 (they stack with slugger 3) cause of dimishing returns at higher resistances. Consider fireproof 1 + asbestos chest mod instead of either good doggy or aquaboy. Or raise endurance to 8 and take fireproof 3 + pneumatic chest mod (lower charisma to 4 and annoyingly get rid of tenderizer 3 for travel agent whenever you want to save caps. Personally I like travel agent + squad maneuvers 2 unless I'm boss fighting). I also like escape artist if going sneak melee, so maybe consider dropping int to 3 for 14 agi and skip out on first aid 1 for that. If unyielding all 5 pieces you can skip sneak 3 / evasive 3 for dodgy 3. And lastly, serendipity instead of junk shield WITHOUT A DOUBT.
---
Oof! I keep on turning in my tickets hoping for a fancy but nothing yet. I actually had 15.5k caps when I saw the fixer in their vendor. It was right after a meat cook event so I quickly sold off random stuff to get to 16k caps and fast traveled back, snagging it before anyone else!
---

---
makes it unplayable I kinda just crouch in a corner and hope for the best :(
---
After I share this info with him, he’ll start checking the shop daily... he only checks it on Tuesday and Thursday and when I tell him there’s something there he may want. Why didn’t I share this info with him this weekend??? Because I completed my legendary run over a week ago and I didn’t log on this weekend. Man I can’t wait till he gets off of work
---
Same. I resorted to making a new character during meat week and just been casually playing that among other games.
---
Always at your service. All I wanted was the Croco and ended by buying all the past week and payed round about 1,6k atoms damn lol
---
🤣
---
I buy it all the time at one cap, because i don't really care to climb into power armor to get it myself.
---
I had a camp there for a pretty long while. You can build inside that building
---
It's great for hydration but also good for maintaining your rads in a bloodied build.
---
try getting some atoms from them
---
I wish we could get a cool new skin for the survival tent 🥺
---
Hopefully this comment gets the upvotes it deserves.
---
No. It only works on the chest piece and it has to be the red chinese paint.
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment I guess.
---
If you're going to lock them up, do everyone a favor and turn them off. I hate travelling to a CAMP and they have their vendors turned on and locked up.
---
I can set my watch by these posts. If my motivation to log in is driven by Pavlovian reward, doesn’t that tell us something about the state of the end game? Should I really need to be bribed/rewarded to log in and play the game? It’s everything wrong with mobile gaming, and it just tells me that Bethesda has a serious content delivery problem. They are trying to be a live service game following a traditional Fallout DLC schedule, and every time I see this post, it reminds me the strategy is failing.
---
It's intentional, I don't suspect it'll change. Remember, we didn't always have the "FREE" badge on the Atomic Shop, so folks were a bit less prone to even pop into the shop. I believe part of the reason to give out free player icons was to drive people to the Atomic Shop. 
---
You hop on a server, everyone has some new player icon, you assume there's something in the shop for free and you go hunt it down. Also as a bonus, in the past free stuff wasn't really highlighted in anyway, so you often had to just sift through the Player Icons to even find the freebie.
---
These aren't bugs, they're gross marketing mechanics that someone should be ashamed of.
---
Try changing your light and shadow to a lower setting. Teslas put out a ton of light effects that then all have to be processed for shadows.
---
Dude.... its a freaking videogame. Don't spend money if you don't want to on cosmetics. I haven't spent a dime besides the initial purchase of the game itself.
---
The atom shop rewards are pretty lame, especially when they went so hard that first month to get people in than it just dropped to 1 or 2 items that are so insignificant. I just look at the "free item" like it doesn't exist as its the other stuff that's useful.
---
Your level means absolutely nothing if you don't have good gear and perks.
---
Make sure you are using level 45 or 50 weapons and armor.
---
 Also make sure they are modded with the best mods you can use.
---
You could always make a sales list when you stock them up. I imagine a checklist app would work as well.
---
Separate each vendor to its own list as well to make things easier.
---
From there it's just check which vendor has less in it when you left and refer to the checklist
---
ouch 😂
---
The fact you cant pick what song to play on the jukebox is pretty dumb, as thats how jukeboxes work
---
I think it's specifically for the people that started really late.
---
that's just the sub.
---
Someone literally just asked if the "Wendigo Colossus event" was over. This is what I mean about people missing information, etc. It's hard to know what's a bug and what's people being mistaken.
---
You really think these absurd builds are anywhere close to what a Fallout game is about? They're clown builds that work because a game is broken.
---
Food build. Lol.
---
i'd literally be gone a minute while i go buy some recall cards from the train stations.
---
This "*they also said there is absolutely nothing they can do*" is absolute and complete lie.
---
If they wanted to, they could give atoms to compensate the loss of score. Meaning, they could give the amount required for you to purchase the ranks you lost. But they just choose not to do it anymore.
---
I use the word anymore because they have done so in the past. The autocomplete bug is a really old one. It has been around for months and months before season started. I personally have made a ticket about the autocompleted challenges twice in the past, when they used to reward atoms, and was given atoms equal to the amount i had missed. And i have seen lots of posts in the past from other people who have experienced the same thing and gotten atoms after making a ticket.
---
So them saying they can't do anything about it is complete bullshit.
---
It literally was. If for the entire season it was 7 dailies and 7 weeklies +1 relatable weekly, you would’ve been short around 5-10k score. That means grinding 500,000 to 1,000,000 to complete it.
---
Yea, I had to delete the door.  it's so annoying
---
Thanks for the details.
---
Well I don’t really mean the events. They bumped up the total amount of available dailies after like a few weeks because everybody was getting the autocomplete bug. That was their solution. Give out more dailies to make up for the loss. I think in the beginning there was only like 5 or 6 dailies and they threw in like another 4 per day. So I’m wondering if they’ll go back to the “default” amount for season 2.
---
I don’t think the 50 cal fires fast enough.
---
I logged in and saw. It does look better than the other one but pass lol
---
Didn't think of that. Usually see the Gutsys eating people's lunch.
---
She's scamming all of us. Every so often she does drop something really nice.
---
Yep cursed pickaxe does some excellent damage. Shovel is fun as well. bonk! bonk!
---
Get use to it. You'll get around 95% garbage on a regular basis.
---
Scam
---
Doesn't work with mini-nukes or missiles though. still have to craft those by hand or find them in the wasteland. Then again, pretty much nobody uses them so I guess in the grand scheme of things nothing much is lost.
---
On a trading sub Reddit that be flamer could get you almost any armor or weapon you wanted in trade, if you find the right collector possibly multiple items for your one.
---
So does the normal jukebox
---
Just wait until you get a god tier drop from a random legendary enemy as you go about your normal business. Only then will you understand the plight of the legendary weapon chase.
---
Note to self, try and finish September 7th.  Fool me once!
---
(note I just notice I think you were asking about the first shop not my long why I love camp building) I prefer camp items over clothing we have so so so many options for clothing already bog wanderer was kinda neat but the other clothing aside from the first NCR was meh. The thatch rug was nice the bed is okay if you want to do a sleazy hotel style, the new workbench looks great. Like it is night and day over the other armor benches so I see it as a huge step by them myself.  
---
Now onto my rant I wrote up before re-reading your reply.  
---
One of my personal fun times is CAMP building so the recent bundles have been great. Today is a win for me also with the gold rocket and the jukebox. Seeing that the season 2 awards have an arcade game and a foosball table and golf cart ride I have decided one of my camps will be a fun land style entertainment center. Rides games toys and such. I just need the giddyup butter cup ride and gold fuzzy ride.   
---
If they produce another camp budget glitch I have a shopping mall prebuilt already it is just a structure taking up 92% of my budget but it is 7 stories starts on floor 4. 4,5,6 are indoors, 7 is a open air shooting range and trophy hall with kid play area it is built on 4 2x1 towers it is 11x11 at the mid point and working inwards on the sides. So it is HUGE. and just waiting for mannequins and a budget glitch, ground level will have workshops and a huge farm but I have to be careful not to pass 300% budget or the server gets a bit wonky. (does not apply to display items for some reason so no complaints there)
---
only issue I have is that they made it so you have to have those multiple cards to allow for flexibility in your build.  If they allowed you to break down a maxed card then this would make a lot of sense.  You have to have a 5 point card to mod weapons but most of use don't run that way.
---
It doesn't, honestly. The entire track is leaked now, it largely looks bad.
---
Yeah honestly didn't know they helped.  I am a heavy gunner, but even when I was a rifleman I never used scopes
---
That's good to know tho
---
Or even keep an eye on your caps and when it hits a certain level, say 25-28k depending how much your items cost, buy something before it maxes. Prevention is better than cure.
---
Just curious cause I saw someone selling it in vending for 200 a piece.  I just drop the stuff...
---
I should be done today with it.  it's such a grind.  I dont know how anyone finished this a month ago.  I've played a couple hours every day and just now to the end
---
Wow, I had no idea.  I was going to try and make this my daily game until Cyberpunk, with First subscribed.  I'll probably unsubscribe when I get home from work today.  Heartbreaking really.
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
&gt;Legendary Perks themselves are **NOT shared** across all characters - Each character has to **choose and upgrade Legendary Perks individually**.
---
[My reaction](https://youtu.be/DWtpNPZ4tb4)
---
It's more that the classical tracks in this game aren't good. There's plenty of beautiful classical music, but this game has almost none of it.
---
They removed the legendary effect completely. They didn’t remove the masks from the inventory. 
---
Additionally, that was done in a relative short time frame from when that was introduced. 
---
I don’t think they handled that properly either. So why would I support them using poor judgment a second time around?
---
Yeah i'm aware of this page and i roughly know how damage resistance works. You mean that the lower your weapon's dmg is the more mitigation its damage will receive. Overall a weapon with less firerate with higher damage per shot will have to go through less damage mitigation. 
---
But still, i'm sorry dude, it's not working for me and what i see. I see constancy...
---
To me it's clear...a 25% firerate offers me 25% more performance that is would without this major modifier.
---
And if you play on a sniper build, for sure it's another story and it depends on what you are planning to do with you weapon. But for automatic weapons there's is just no point to go with a 10% major modifier you'll lose way too much dps. I don't understand how you came up with only 5% more dps, but there's no way you tested it on an automatic rifle.
---
Anyway thank you for links, peace man✌
---
Thanks For the Advice
---
Thanks for the Advice
---
Sad to see the mini nuke perk go, would have been nice to dust off my fat man every once in a while. I can see why it was scrapped though, almost no one uses them already and it's an entire card for 1 single weapon vs all the other cards affecting multiple. Just not enough bang for your buck.
---
Cannibal perk. Great fun. Entertains the noobs in the Forest, but a few times I have tried to jump to a high spot to get out of trouble....and I am too close to a corpse and I accidentally start my feast.  And then I am overrun by 62 level ghouls and I become the feast.
---
Remember that time they fixed the lightbulb that was out in watoga station that no one even knew was out? They couldn't have done that if they were working on those legacy weapons.
---
Orders fallout atoms get sent live nukes set to go off 5 minutes after being unpackaged.
---
I wouldn't really say they're greedy. The fact of the matter is that all licensed music works like this.
---
Besides, they had already purchased the rights to use Frank Sinatra's music in New Vegas, so that alone would've put a dent in their wallets. With that in mind, I'm sure that purchasing the license to use the music of one of the biggest pop culture icons in history would've really hurt them financially.
---
This is a thing in almost every video game. Damage drop off for guns start at very short ranges and you hit minimum damage values at ranges under 100m for all but the most extreme long range options. Yes in real life a 5.56 doesn't even begin to start noticeably dropping or loosing much velocity after 150m. But most games don't even have gun fights that are even anywhere near that kind of distance.
---
Now that's strategy right there. Here I am scrapping junk.
---
Funny because both builds worked in fallout 4, infact they were even stronger.
---
Not intended hmm? If not intended then why was that not address on the pts? Instead of changed how effects stacked?  You can not like a playstyle that’s totally fine, but to blurt out nonsense and expect not to get called out on it is pretty dim. Its a *DPS* role. Specific and specialized. If you dont like that then maybe online games arent for you 🤷‍♂️
---
I was under the impression that it was akin to a thrown explosive and not ammo.
---
I've never had it happen unless I join Nuclear Winter before playing adventure mode.
---
I check the store first every single day and never had the issue.
---
Maybe I'm lucky, but I don't personally think it's the store.
---
Someone had to say it!
---
Maybe stop it after a certain level then at least
---
Well done!
---
I’m thirsty for water lite
---
I only came back to the game like, a month ago?  I'm at rank 74/100.  Doubt I'll finish, even with this, but I should be able to get the chicken coop at least (last thing I really wanted).
---
Just do what I did with one of my characters. Place a normal small radio, that plays Appalacian Radio...use the defence flame-thrower trick to destroy it, build the jukebox over it(enough jutting out to see it), then repair.
---
If you place it right, around the back, you can play the popular music without turning on the jukebox. There are videos on YouTube that explain the technique much better.
---
I saw, thanks!
---
Thx!
---
I have some lv 200 plus characters that still need to scrap weapons, the mod learn chance is so low on the Gattling gun and radium rifle!
---
Found it. The Wastelanders patch itself lol
---

---
Totally agree!!  I’m level 99. Praying to knock it out today but afraid to log in!  Lol
---
It's not even a good roll for it tbh, like the effects kind of go together but the alien blaster isn't a great choice for a medic's weapon. It's not a great choice as a weapon, period, but that's a whole different issue
---
That would be great if they didnt fall through the damn ground all the time anyways!
---
Clandestine Service Paint.
---
Basically a Matte black.
---
I think many people have wanted the silver shroud smg to make a return since we got the outfit well over a year ago
---
Makes great sense. They pump out atom shop content like its their job (ha..ha) just bring a couple outfits into the loot pool of events at the very least.
---
The game needs something.
---
They could easily do the same thing with legacy weapons though
---
I wonder how many weapons you need for that to occur. I'm running around w/ a bunch of heavy weapons with the bear arms perk and I'm noticing some slow down on my end when in the menus. Hopefully it's just on my end and not affecting other peoples games.
---
Joining NW is equivalent to checking the store, because the game automatically checks the store for your NW favorites
---
Same goes for skins and outfits, honestly.
---
Quit taking off my damn ghillie suit!
---
Correct, when I hit ~25k, I turn off my vendors, and go looking for scrip weapons/armor to stash on mules for lean scrip times. If, someone happens to find my CAMP while my vendors are turned off, I still have a little room for additional caps. I also have ~30 recall cards.
---
Oh man, don’t say that. I’ve run the event 3 times using Tormentor, and didn’t have any problems. Hope I wasn’t just “lucky”.
---
There is a good reason why Bethesda put a scrip machine at the Rusty Pick, they know that the RNG sucks. Why can't we pick what we want from a list? Like at any of the vendor locations??
---
From what I read (don't take my word for it) the company they use to license their music from went under or was purchased. Thus the even more limited soundtrack.
---
Welp looks like I won’t finish it, only at 68
---
Yeah, she scamming and we like it
---
It's too bad music "has" to work this way.  It's such a crappy system designed to bring money to people who don't deserve it (the record company as opposed to the artist).  Record companies are obsolete in the age of the internet - anyone can record high quality music and distribute it themselves now.
---
As with most things in our society, antiquated systems are allowed to continue because "that's the way it is."  I hate that logic. 
---
Sorry, off topic rant a bit here lol
---
I hope one day we get a skin for my Double Barrel Shotgun. 👍
---
I get my guy out of his gear to sleep at the end of the day. That shovel digging into his head just looks uncomfortable. Usually I dress him in the flannel shirt outfit, but I recently found a bathrobe. I think, though it might be comfortable, he’d just feel to unprepared to fight if dressed in just a robe. Wasteland hyper vigilance being what is is.
---
On the other side of this, I sold a 3* Vampire Minigun that was an accelerated barrel away from being magic for 1000c before I got into the Meta.
---
So you can have 3 different unwanted leftovers to choose from? 
---
'What shall I pick this week? 💩, 💩 or maybe 💩 tough decision'
---
For such case I have armour part. 
---
I have not tested it with PA yet
---
Anyway looks like not 200+ must, but 150+ is enough when your connection is fast &amp; stable. I have another JAimDmg LMG which is not enough fast, but it works magically
---
Other strange thing. I have IFFR Gatling laser which must be Magic, but something is wrong with this weapon bcz I haven’t received expected effect (
---
Fusion core and plasma should be consumable to the power armor and weapon at a 99/99 max and out of our inventory
---
I'd kill to get black powder weapons and bolt action pipes from her
---
I've had maybe 2 great weapons from her, everything else was recycled
---
oh, if that's the case then that would have been pretty neat.
---
Oh boy! A free icon!
---
Because they are the upgraded versions, like the ones raiders and gunners use in 4
---
People can't handle the truth! 
---
Thank you kind stranger ❤ 
---
(&amp; before anyone says Im hating, I absolutely love Fallout 4 and its 1 out of 2 out of 40+ games I actually finished on my PS4 and bought it on PC for the true modded experience)
---
How long is this going to be active for?
---
yeah I had a similar build in fo4. deep pocketed armour is a godsend. besides, fusion cores are too frustrating to deal with anyways
---
I am also wondering what specifically "matching set of armor" means.
---
When vendors are locked I like to glitch through the door and even if I see nothing I like I'll buy something.
---
u/ladydevann
---
The next F1st subscriber that wont renew because of the challenge bug and the miserable CS. :/
---
I agree, but this is one of those cases where I feel like if somebody were to point a gun to a developer's head and told them to "fix a bug," I would rather them prioritize the long list of in-game bugs like the fast-travel bug than fix something like this. In a perfect world it should all be fixed, but we don't live in a perfect world unfortunately.
---
But what about the time he gets that amazing roll only to find out it’s a level 30
---
Any news on whether season 2 battle pass will be free? Or was that just for season 1?
---
Because it weighs less than water.
---
TSE Tesla rifle for 3k.
---
Green thumb &amp; CSS?
---
I wonder how hard it would be for them to get the licensing for them to use songs they already used in past Fallout titles.
---
Good point. Those guys Debussey, Beethoven, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Bach, Chopin, Schumann, and Offenbach were such clowns.
---
Tbf I don’t think it’s even deep
---
Pocketed
---
I will say to at least head over to Camden Park to since you've popped all three dailies there.  lol  (I wait until I have at least two.)
---
Remind me to never tell you a secret ;)
---
It’s really hit or miss, I have a JFFR ultracite Gatling that sometimes melts, sometimes doesn’t. I think the magic effect is very heavily server dependent and not something you can rely on.
---
Agreed, just update the existing rewards to work with the new Power armor models. 
---
also, all the NW skins work with all T-series (except 65) and X-01. kinda wish they made them work for every model, even Excavator
---
Sshhhhhhh
---
Did you now? I would not be caught using a Tesla. The audacity...
---
That would definitely work. I don't mind giving other players caps for something I use though.
---
By any chance do you know how much budget the satellite takes when you build it and then store it and can see % ?
---
clownshoe
---
Yes, and I got rid of it for this very reason.  I like the look of it but can't stand the music from it.
---
That’s a great weapon to save for an alt. 
---
Once we get the One Wasteland update, that really won’t be an issue anymore.
---
Possible that it was put in the vendor as raw flux and spoiled. Still though...200 caps is a bit steep. I actually use inert flux for my water needs, but I don't usually buy it. I have tried it in my vendor at 1 cap and it did not sell well.
---
starting next season the bullion vendors will sell items from previous seasons camp related
---
pretty sure i saw chicken coop for bullion on the preview.
---
I’m still skeptical, so if I happen to do leader of the pack, I’m gonna get level 50 legendary drops? It’ll be awesome, I hope so
---
I thought that finding a specific collectable the first time, should give you a one off plan or part of a plan to build that collectable, then once you have all the plans you can build the display as a single unit, rather than 20 individual items.
---
I wouldn’t even pay that much for *Stable Flux.*
---
Yeah I missed it, I’ve been away
---
They should just hire session musicians an do the kinda stuff you hear on Old World Radio, the Fallout Fan Radio stuff  on YouTube. 
---
Some of the cover versions on there are tremendous, especially the modern pop done in 50s style.
---
We could also do with another couple of stations. Old Timey tracks that  fit into 76 and even a talk-radio station that'd cost pennies to produce. That could be beefed out with the best and vetted fan contributions too. Imagine, hours upon hours of lore type stuff that could have endless potential.
---
I wish we'd get something other than generic forest camo :(
---
T-65 and SS armor would look really cool with the camo pattern that's on the BOS fatigues and upcoming Spec Ops outfit.
---
I feel like the bigger problem is ap even with action girl/boy rank 3
---
I think season 2 has great rewards. I was sold on glass walls and ceilings, but clearly it’s not what everyone is after.
---
It said for one week, until the 8th.  The end of the run.
---
I agree with u. I think it 90% on server side. Looking on process How it works: sometimes first bullets are Magic, sometimes you must make more shots to increase damage to crazy rate. 
---
The best sample for this case- rifles. 
---
Again strange thing about rifles: sometimes B33VATS combat rifle makes Magic in Vats, but mainly (in other 90% cases) you must shoot w/o Vats
---
From what I understand, if you’re level 50, you’d see level 50 wolves, for example. So, a tad harder to kill, but they’ll drop level-appropriate loot. 
---
But your level 15 buddy would see the same wolves closer to their level, and get level-appropriate loot.  
---
I think this will actually make low level legendary gear *more* rare. So I’ve been holding on to low level gear with good effects, just in case.
---
Oh you've got to be kidding me ... WTF? It's essentially a jukebox from a diner. How many diners play/played classical music?
---
Give us perk cards instead so we can actually level legendary perks instead.
---
I'm lucky if I get a decent item, either weapon or armor, in one out of 50 tries.   So basically I have a 98% chance of getting garbage.
---
One thing I did notice is that higher levels seemed to have better luck.  I have 2 characters that are around level 300 and started a 3rd one about 2 months ago.  Once the 3rd character hit level 50 I started rolling the dice with the Purveyor and all I got was crap.  It wasn't until my character list 80-100 when I finally for things like Scout armor or decent fixers.  I still have not gotten a decent handmade through the character #3.
---
* game runs worse and laggy when someone using them,
---
That's simply a lie. You get the same effect with any other WMD. It's the meat piles WITH THE FLIES, that will lag you out.
---
This is also the reason for this mod  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/490](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/490)
---
Wish I'd seen this earlier. WTF
---
That's how it's going to work, yeah.
---
No prob, yw.
---
Level doesn’t affect your HP. But the rest is accurate.
---
I see a Tesla, I nuke the boss with my magic weapon as fast as possible.
---
THAT!! would be awesome
---
You either:
---
Dropped it by accident
---
Scrapped it by accident
---
Sold/ traded it by accident
---
Stuff doesn’t just “disappear.” There’s other glitches that can happen, like when scrapping a lot of stuff at the same time it can scrap items in entirely other sections of the pip boy. Or, like I stated above u accidentally dropped it
---
[Here you go](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html)
---
I never buy anything new from the Atomic Shop. Wait a month or 2 and it will always come back at 30-50% off. Even the bundles. Never fails. Especially now that they are fucking us on daily and weekly atoms in game. 👍
---
Now I wish I wouldn’t of focused so much on logging in daily and grinding. I got burnt out and now I don’t even want to play right now.
---
I crafted like 8k ammo without ammosmith or super duper
---
Hah thats crazy. I always have an abundance of glowing mass and next to none hardened x)
---
Don't forget that one wasteland is coming out so you may start seeing level 100 enemies in the game. I can't imagine they will be super common but expect to see more scaling.
---
Check your Workshop menu(Floor Decor section).
---
Often stuff leaves the Shop but stays in the Workshop appropriate section, giving you the chance to buy weeks later. Not always but sometimes.
---
Ahhhhh, ok. That makes a little more sense
---
I'll log into your account and finish it for you.  What are your username and password?
---
Honestly I hope between now and October nothing good shows up so I can blow all the atoms on Halloween stuff.
---
Also an issue.
---
We don't really have the advantage of Unyielding so we don't get the crazy high stats.  Makes the high ROF weapons pretty unusable in VATS, since a single pulse from my minigun drains my AP completely.
---
At least single shot weapons aren't as bad in that regard, I can usually get a good three or four shots out of my Plasma Caster in vats, and I've only got 3 agility. 
---
(looking forward to increasing that with legendary perks, AP is still nice for Dodgy users)
---
Hey its like the Blood Eagle statue that will continue to make the loud ass noise and blow fire as soon as you fast travel, even if you toggle it off.
---
I literally just drop it.  I can already craft enough ammo without the converter.
---
Exactly. No point investing all that time for something that'll get deleted after a few days over and over. At least with my current character the levels stick around and count for something
---
There should be a perk that reduces fusion core consumption for VATS.
---
Is this true 😱
---
Not so concerned about the pick. I’ve got mine already. The OP was talking about a random guaranteed 3* in addition to the chance at the pick. That’s the thing I’m interested in knowing where it’s found (ie Earle, chest, or quest reward). Honestly, I have the helmet and all the plans I want from this event now so the 3* random legendary would be the only reason I’d go waste all that ammo (which, yes, I know I can partially recuperate from the wendigo spawns)
---
I give a warning first.  The moment I see that tesla arc, minigun comes out Earl goes down.
---
Just the armor workbench atm, for free
---
Deathclaw mask for 22 caps
---
I get it; I've seen my fair share of instances like that, myself.
---
This is how I roll, but it does catch up to you when you have to go into a nuke zone. Best case, I go from having ~100lbs of free space to maybe 5. Worst case, I'm hilariously overencumbered.
---
Well that's an um...Deep Thought. Did you wait 7.5 million years?  :-)
---
The enemies will be your level for you and lvl 30 for a lvl 30.
---
I never used to use them except for the ammo weight perk, but somewhere around level 300 I started using rank 3 travelling pharmacy and rank 2 thru hiker because I had a full stash and had nowhere to store chems and colas and haloween candy. I can spare the perk slots though, I'm doing plenty of damage as it is.
---
I saved mine until the end because it takes more to level up every time. The last 4 levels would be the same as like the first 10 or 15 but they're all the same price of atoms. I personally wanted to grind as much as I feel like and then by the rest because it's best for price and I use the atoms I earned on the way too
---
Shame.
---
Well it worked!
---
Unfortunately didn’t work
---
LOL chemist backpack plus the 5 wwr armor, I cant wear power armor. I go from 260 to 700+.
---
At least the Wolfman has nards!
---
Why?  It means both people can actually do decent damage.  Why is that bad?
---
You find lots of stuff in there that's left the Shop. No guarantee, but  worth a look.
---
If there is a red Atom symbol by it you know you don't own but can buy. I've got a few things this way once they've gone. 
---
Hope your plushie is there.
---
The unlink and relink actually worked. People can see me now after all these months
---
&gt; It is kind of a bummer there isn’t just different musical variants of them like FO4.
---
Even then that only applied to the little radio. The Jukebox still only played classical
---
Thanks for letting me know, I'll try it.
---
Same here. I see one I pull my mini and wham... 3 seconds no more fps issues.
---
I've done it but it feels even less rewarding because it gets deleted. It's worse that the levels I try to earn go nowhere whereas skipping them and using my regular character more gets me levels that are actually useful
---
If I join a lobby and noticed that I haven’t turned the “team fill” off... I go back to the main menu. Hiding in bushes isn’t for everybody. Lol...On a sidenote, when I play with my brother and my niece and a couple other online friends I don’t spend much time in bushes
---
The damage calculator I linked earlier does all the math and works great for single projectile weapons. Where it falls short is for multiple projectile weapons (shotguns, two shot, explosive, beam splitter) because it calculates it as if all of the damage were coming from a single projectile. Obviously with that damage equation a shotgun should do poorly against armor because its damage is spread across 8 projectiles. Two shot is the same, to a lesser extent. 
---
To get around this, I set up LMGs that matched the weapons the OP is asking about (two shot LMGs with either aim damage or rof boosts). Because they're two-shot I divided that damage by two and played with the perks until I got LMGs that dealt that reduced amount of damage. DPS against various enemies is listed at the bottom in that table. 
---
Incidentally the fact that they're two shot is why aim damage makes such a big difference - two shot is crappier against armor the same way that shotguns are crappy against armor, especially on a high ROF/low damage per shot weapon. If you've got the stabilized perk you're mitigating some of the armor so it doesn't matter as much, but if you're not in power armor, performance against armor matters a lot so aim damage does relatively well.
---
Do we know how nuke zones will work? There's still level caps and certain things will still spawn it at higher levels no matter what.
---
Well will next season fix the dalies? I've got a hint at the answer, it isn't yes.
---
Sounds like the nuke hit as you were loading in.
---
The legendary stats should go up to 20 so they actually are legendary!!
---
Correct.
---
I understand that completely, its great for people who aren't that into combat or don't have the experience in it yet, but I still think it would be handy to have a slider to set the max encounter level. (That can't go below current level for obvious reasons)
---
Why clean? Just need a rustic bucket and beaker set with a chair. Just shake and bake all your chems like the real walter white. Lol
---
The problem is that unfortunately the jukebox auto turns itself on while the normal radios auto turn themselves off regularly
---
Hahaha well you didn't know either. I had a family thing so i couldn't log in 🙄 i knew this would happen. But yeah i check every day now, thanks to someone here in reedit that commented that the Halloween vendor was on sale, and next day was the Christmas one.
---
it's out :)
---
Today I got the lovley experience of auto score completion for just launching the game at 11:59 thinking they've patched that by now
---
Dropped gear on a private, logged into adventure.   Lost some nice stuff =\
---
I have Tormentor on and share it with the team. Don't think any of us crippled Earl at any point. I only played like 10 ACP so far though. Radiation Rumble spawns will cripple.
---
Repairing your camp after a nuke drop should be free tbh
---
Just... level up
---
It places, but it does have a square-shaped base which will float a bit, instead of just a simple pole.  From ground view, though, it just looks like a satellite dish on the roof.  I usually stick one up there because there just aren't too many options for decorating rooftops.
---
Something I'd rather see and they never mention is the concrete building set from FO4.  Can't make a decent bunker without it.  Screw that little Chinese igloo with no base and everything floats above the ground in it.
---
I only bought the grognak and alien since those aren't in the plushie bundle that'll probably show up in the near future again
---
When is the nerf coming?
---
From what I understand, no
---
That's definitely not going to happen before the next patch.
---
Does Exploding Palm work with unarmed weapons such as the Power Fist and other Gauntlets?
---
Was wearing it when I got into PA, didnt scrap or drop anything (doing Colossal Problem again), it was gone when I left the event and got out of the blast zone to exit PA.
---
There's 80 million bugs in this game and you think that's not even possible?
---
That is how I like to level up.
---
Because if the lvl difference between tagger and enemy is really high, the XP gained is really high.
---
 Howmuch is the red rocket furniture bundle?
---
I use adrenaline heavily so I always tag/kill 5 enemies before focusing Earle
---
I won't be renewing - I paid for a whole year and really don't feel as though I got my money's worth.  
---
A persistent world? That might do it. Larger build budgets. (You know, what we were promised)  
---
I did initially pay to support the game, as a hope that it would encourage game development. I might revisit it if I see some enrichment to the program.
---
I would if it didn't get auto completed
---
One Level 1 pipe pistol chambered for .38 coming right up ....
---
&gt;Were you expecting them to either never ever add more PA to the game or that  they'd just give you freebies every single time they add a new set?
---
I mean, it would be nice...
---
Now whenever they bring back a Power Armor bundle, which they frequently do, T-65 is the odd man out, much like Ultracite PA has been from the beginning.  The posts about "Does this work on my T-65?" / "I'm so disappointed there isn't a T-65 option for this" are inevitable.
---
I love it when people try to say legacies anrnt OP.  Hahah hahahah haha.  
---
Exploding effect still does the pre nerf damage.  Yea there weak all right.
---
&gt;Don't worry about the fact that even with a 30% buff it will no longer be viable anywhere on the map with one wasteland, or that the bugged delayed projectiles still haven't been fixed after almost 2 years, just buy the skin
---
Username checks out. I laughed.
---
The words "I can't do anything about it" is basically code for...i personally don't have permission from the company, or given access to the tools to do it which is another department that doesn't want the responsibility anymore or they want to reduce workload.
---
They are *technically* telling the truth.
---
They are just passing the costs to you, it's probably the same reason they don't want to add a official chat box. More work load for moderating other people's problems, not enough resources.
---
The more they have to moderate the more it distracts from other things. so in their minds they are cutting workload to focus on what they feel is important. I am not saying it's right, but in the position they are in they have to ignore certain bugs/issues and focus on only certain ones while developing future content.
---
It's a balancing act of where to spend their resources while leaving enough resources left over to tackling new challenges/glitches/problems that pop up.
---
So in the end they could compensate you, but the company itself is short-changing the dev team and not giving them the proper resources they need to do the customer service that is needed.
---
I don't think it's right that they compensated people in the past and now they refuse, but they probably changed their policies since they would probably end up investigating false claims or trolls or just simply many claims increased customer service workload by A LOT.
---
They probably thought increasing challenges per day and extra weekly score would be a more fitting compensation than giving more free atoms.
---
So I know which three cards I’m getting 6 Perk Coins from. Nice.
---
I sent you a friend request, same name in game as on here. If you still need one I'll give you one when you're online.
---
Their business model is literally to sell ATOMs for money.  They aren't going to give away any more than they absolutely HAVE to.
---
Having said that, there are other things they could give us: perk cards, script, experience, stable flux, gold, etc.
---
I'm guessing this will completely break the game. It already cant handle damage calcs, and this is only going to bog things down, further.  This seems like an attempt to right the wrong that is leveled guns/armor.  If all pipe pistols did the same damage, would there be a need for this?
---
Why are they still in game?  Cause they were all duped to high heaven.
---
The events are usually never on when I do it so doing the beginning stuff is still quicker. Obviously I do events when they're there
---
You aren't missing out on much.
---
Between the spotless concrete floor and the weird green metal roof, it really doesn't fit the log cabin aesthetic at all.
---
I’ve found him north of Picketts since wastelanders dropped
---
Toxic valley there’s a triple shot of locations sorta near hemlock holes where is has a chance to spawn
---
Sorry haha. I know the cripple in place glitch can lead to clipping straight through the ground. Had that last night lol. We were 5 seconds away from killing him and he just vanished. We thought his hp was dropping when we threw grenades but 30 throws later and he was still alive so🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Is the caravan trader outfit gonna make a return to the atomic shop? Missed my chance to get it before and really want it
---
2 Old Man Winter Masks at 20 caps each at different camps.
---
The armour levelling really is unnecessary. Why do we need tiered and levelled armour?
---
Oh right. I forgot how broken my game was when that wasn’t working. I could barely see that corner of the train station without my brightness set to at least 25%. My game was broken
---
You probably still could with the double score for the rest of the week.
---
Next patch ( next season ). But appenrently it was a bug that has been fixed recently.
---
Legendary perks?
---
Damn, same story here. I missed out on the raider tent and elite ranger armor because of the lack of content atm, i wore that bog outfit for 5 mins and haven't worn it since.
---
I stopped the dialies too. I have enough notes that the dailies are useless and I maxed out my standing so I don't bother apart from the daily challenge that says to do a daily mission
---
Still waiting on that vertibird PA... was hoping we'd get it by now but now looking like a Steel Dawn release. :(
---
It did ‘sound’ like it (the initial blast sound). I’m not far from ACP but usually the zones don’t hit me (I’m usually far too north) 
---
I’ve built in this place for almost since launch so I’m really hoping I don’t have to trash it and move on.
---
What level are you at?
---
Take my grumpy upvote
---
And it shouldn't be, glad this was fixed.
---
I wouldn't mind gold or scrip..
---
I would wait on scrapping them all especially with load outs coming and the attribute legendary perks being good
---
From what you are saying, I understand it to mean we need a journal of items sold and I agree.  The pop up is so fast I hardly have time to see what sold before it disappears.
---
Mine seem to have noticeably reduced damage. Can you share a resource that supports your position?
---
Same with the .50 cal MG, anything short of a Mirelurk Queen or Scorchbeast should be turned into chunky salsa. Not even a Deathclaw could survive a burst of .50 cal rounds, tbh
---
Yes please.
---
New perks coming this September.
---
You need to scrap perk cards to level them and as is its a huge grind.
---
Hang in there buddy. It wont be long now. I'm sure it will be released next week...
---
You have to be twice their level was the other part. So a 60 deathclaw means you have to be at least level 120.
---
Bargain.
---
At least you could argue that his absence continues a joke from the original Fallouts about how no one really remembered who Elvis was.  They just had velvet pictures of him on the walls.
---
I mean, it's almost 200 years after he lived.  It would be like us having a lively discussion about Chopin.
---
Lvl. 300 here. Seen the opposite happen as well. A team of random low levels have taken out organized high level teams. Literally and figuratively gotta deal w the cards you’re dealt, and if it doesn’t work out then try again if you’d like. No point in bitchin. There are so many other things to consider. 
---
And as somebody who plays NW regularly, every once in a while you’ll see us running solos or duos. After a while you don’t see in levels anymore, all you’d recognize are the people making names for themselves in the lobbies.
---
Some stuff is good indeed, but the season 2 in total is terrible. The glasshouse items are on rank 98 or something that late, and we also get filler ranks like some stimpaks, rad-x and radaway etc. Technically you would buy 10stims for 1,50 bucks.
---
Wasn’t sure if anybody was going to catch that, lol
---
Have you looked at the building at the cemetery south of pickets?
---
There are level floors for each area. So a level range might be from 50-100 in the cranberry bog, where places outside vault 76 might be 1-100.
---
In other words you can still go to higher level areas if you want more experience.
---
Also fighting enemies consistently your level or above will make it so you gain even more experience.
---
this is great. mothman is also my favorite. i never did see a hostile one (just wise old mothman) but in a way, im glad since they dont give me an aggressive vibe and would have felt bad fighting one
---
I like the frat house one
---
I'd like if it had a use too, like sleeping in a bed, playing music or the upcoming  weight bench.
---
\+1 to all specials for an hour would be good.
---
You can max your SPECIAL in FO:NV, I believe. It’s just very time consuming. 
---
And in FO3, there’s a perk that sets all of your SPECIALs to 9, and then you go get the seven Bobbleheads.
---
You mean if your legendary slots were shared, or the perks themselves? Because the slots are shared.
---
Yes something like that
---
He has a couple more of the osmosis kits, but it’s the principle
---
You shall not craft!

\*cough\* todd howards board of directors \*cough\*

For bloodied weapons?

I mean, if someone threw a grenade at me in real life, I would probably move away from it
---
1st login this morning I had my camp in a nuke zone. Was the 1st time in months. Someone nuked Whitesprings. As soon as I was able to pull the map up and see this I left the world and joined another. Guess I got lucky cause my camp was all there when I went to it. It was well within the zone also.
---
Ahh, crap... It's worse than I thought then ...
---
Shouldn't be?
---
So every MMORP in the last years did it wrong?
---
White springs clubhouse is back to a decent daily  XP run spot as well....
---
I can't stand the "log off before" utter bullshit. It has never had anything to do with it. Had it more than once and was never on for reset.
---
Sorry about about that. Worth knowing. That's how I got the trees and some of the furniture.
---
Not much of a pain to turn off and the other on while you are in CAMP.
---
Cool sign though for real. I wouldn't sneak in just because you took the time.i have my vendors in the same dome.i was lucky enough to be able to place it over a junk pile .looks really good with the concrete floor
---
I wish they would change the Vat's Targeting Matrix mod to reduce vats cost. It would make more sense and would make it a mod people would use more often.
---
I finished the run almost 2 weeks ago without rank purchases using atoms.  I also was away for a week on vacation during that run, so I managed to do it with a buffer of 3- weeks of no playing.
---
That said, I think the daily level up challenge is critical as was the extra score and double XP weekends.  Those allowed me to leapfrog ahead.  I only did maybe half of the NW challenges, usually pick a lock, place a camp, or use a stimpack and avoided the level up, kill a player etc. as I'm not big on NW.
---
Early on when I saw how far ahead other players were compared to me, I thought there was no way I could do it, but it was a lot easier than I expected.  It was nice having the Zorbo game piece to compare progress with.  As long as I was ahead of him, I was good.
---
It's high time they stopped with all the icons and handed out some CAMP decor instead..!
---
Agreed nothing like going into Nuclear winter and realizing your outfit is all screwed up. So same on the outfits.
---
i would like that too.
---
I've crippled Earle countless times with Enforcer + Shotgun and haven't seen any correlation like this.
---
Yeah, like the 3 FU that cost every stein. Like WTF and you pretend us to show them?
---
But how fast is it like using a stimpack fast or alot slower?
---
&gt; Just open your arms and embrace getting fucked 
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself, sometimes you really need to accept it. OP needs a straw so they could suck it up. Lol
---
Stop worrying about power leveling and just play the game.  Once you get high enough level you can power level fine anyway.  In fact you can power level even harder in the pts than live currently.  So I think it's the opposite of what people fear.
---
I only ever got  it when I didn't log out and played through the reset.
---
It really needs another pass at some point.  Not only are some important ammo types missing (seriously, why is 2mm absent, but Gamma Rounds - which only work in *one* gun - aren't?), but the production rate is all over the place.  I can't imagine any good reason why it spews out 5.56 like no tomorrow, but not .45.
---
Yet you had a set level limit of 30 and way less perks, if you could do that in this game it would be incredibly op because each special gets to 15 
---
Also this game has the highest natural special stat possible, of 56
---
Its to make new players weaker and restricted to certain areas of the map; same as with weapons.  One Wasteland has the sole point of undoing this.  They could simply remove gear levels and standardize them and we'd be good to go.
---
ur base bad my base great it fought off 3 scorched beasts and 5 fog crawlers
---
"They will come back"...Bethesda with a evil laugh "in a bundle!!"
---
Oh man, that’d be like using Dawnbreaker on Draugr. I’d be all for that.
---
I haven't run into many in 76, so it never occurred to me that it was probably a kid. I hope they asked their parents what it means.
---
Cruise through Whitespring and clear out the ferals.  Good XP and usually 2 to 3 legendaries and glowing creatures.  I often hit 3 or 4 (there's chewing gum in there too!) of the dailies just in Whitespring.
---
I absolutely love it!
---
I need my white powder jumpsuit...
---
I'd argue this is one of those cases where it if *didn't* auto-equip, players wouldn't understand how to equip it, and would promptly forget they even had it.  Just a feeling.
---
Adding it to my list! Thanks!
---
Fantastic! Thanks!
---
Thank you!!
---
Is it the vualt tech one?just bought the responder bundle with the benches.
---
They 100% COULD have some something, though. It’s 150 atoms per level. They could have given you the 600 or whatever atoms that it would have costed you to advance the same amount of SCORE you lost.
---
Every weapons are affected by this nerf, Bethesda is changing the damage formula. They are modifying the way perk cards, drugs and other damage buff items multiply the damage of weapons.
---
And it happens that heavy weapons perk cards weren't working as intended.
---
same.
---
Why "need"?
---
Why not have an option to change athena into an ally thats bound to your character and doubles or triples your capacity in both character and stash
---
I'm not sure if or when it will be back, sorry!
---
Which one is still working?
---
I believe this is fixed in Patch 22
---
I was *in* NW match when the reset happened one day and I completed both NW challenges in the same match, I was so worried it'll bug out 
---
Never happened to me luckily
---
Why not?
---
I love the door and it was the only thing I really wanted badly too.
---
I have 3 tents I think..raider,responders,and another one.missed the xmas one is there a Halloween one also?
---
I just want a vertibird blade skin for one of the two handers, is that too much to ask?  Or just a bumper sword.
---
Why even power armor if not a tank build? 
---
Don't tell me you want to use vats or anything else except heavy weapons.
---
I wish backpacks remained equipped or retained the perk when entering Power Armor.
---
Those Legendary Agility Perk cards might just be the solution to my particular dilemma.
---
I bought a Talon serum from a player vendor for my Unarmed character yesterday.  A bonus 25 percent to my damage seemed perfect until i took a look at the malus, which drops my Agility by four.
---
Which was kinda troubling because my maxed Agility is another fundamental part of my build (i like to sneak around and punch stuff).
---
So basically i could just compensate the penalty to my Agility by maxing out that Legendary Perk?  Or isn't it as easy as it sounds?
---
It would be ever so helpful if the game could just remember the bloody setting from session to session...
---
I'm with you on this - like a lot of other little things missing from 76, it wouldn't be difficult. Store my CAMP's coordinates against my user ID, and when it finds a world to load me into, check them against those of other players in the world. If clash, find new world, if not, continue. I've never had this issue myself, but I can see how it'd be infuriating - I'm sure people with Whitespring homes must get this constantly.
---
Don't know about Halloween but I have only seen the Xmas tent one time and was droolin. It's so awesome. It would be the best thing ever if they released a Halloween one this year
---
Absolutely - great place for a camp esp. if you want reputation! Also spawns Quantum!
---
Here's a pic of my Settler Wanderer putting down a super mutant ... I've got others of her dusting Sheepsquatch as well

As one of my camps is there I can also say you can sometimes spawn 2 separate assault spawns, so 4 sets of creatures. Some are indeed paired. Anyway, I've seen:
---
* Bears and Honey Beasts
---
* Deathclaw and Ants
---
* Mole Miners
---
* Liberators
---
* Raiders
---
* Settlers
---
* Fog Crawlers
---
* Super Mutants
---
* Wolves or Hounds
---
* Scorched
---
* Blood Eagles
---
* Sheepsquatch
---
* Sloth
---
* Mirelurks
---
* Radscorpions
---
* Mole Rats
---
* Protectrons
---
Hack &amp; Slash is infinitely better for this. It has a higher chance to activate, activates not just on kills, and deals your full weapon damage in an area instead of the equivalent of a frag grenade.
---
No valid answer. We don't need anything like that, no reason. You set items to sell on purpose, if they are sold you should not spam the buyer with " mimimi gimme back" or something like that. 
---
If you want to restock, just simply check whats missing.
---
What do you mean? I like the old asthetic the game endures which makes it look like a literal slideshow.
---
You have to die 8 times to reach that cap ::0
---
Lvl 300+ PS4 player here. Only thing I agree w is the gauss shotgun, even then I wouldn’t mind if it stayed so long as they lowered the clip amount and/or nerfed tf out of it. As for the other suggestions I just can’t agree, myself and plenty of others have worked wonders w those weapons. Especially the .44 pistol, explosive bow, and the gauss rifle. Hell, when flatwoods was the only map there was one guy who took out two teams w a pipe rifle. Hearing those stories are pretty awesome Lol these players die the same either way regardless of their weapon
---
I always stay to see how the camp looks that's taking my spot.  And a lot of the time, nothing is even there - so it makes me wonder why it couldn't place my camp.
---
I was just thinking this the other day. Somebody harass the devs by linking them here  until they do it.
---
Why does the Jukebox at the 'one violent night' quest location have a completely different playlist?  I want that one!
---
Yes I am, super annoying but it just kinda lives there now
---
Put a switch in and turn the fuckers off :-)
---
Not collecting outfits or knowing things we're rare drops and selling scrapping most outfits till I was level 200.
---
Yeah I've noticed weapon racks are kinda bugged also.
---
The answer: don't die.
---
That's the first I hear about a lvl floor, lets hope it sees the light on the production server.
---
Well damn. Hopefully it makes the game better and not piss off a lot of people. Just ready for whatever it is that will happen to happen lol.
---
I've done 2 off your list.when I first got a bloodied axe didn't see the level or damage.assualtron wrecked me a few times... once I got comfy with my gear scorchbeast kept wrecking me had to sneak to get it.way easier when I learned about fireproof.must have for me now
---
It won't boost your SPECIAL past 15, so if you're already at 15, you still lose the 4 points and remain at 11.
---
HOWEVER, you could get the Legendary Luck perk instead, and just equip Class Freak to reduce the penalty of Talons to 1 instead of 4!
---
Glad to see this getting some attention! I had this same idea a while ago, too, and I agree, it makes sense! *Especially* for the bobblehead stands, since it's very easy to have one "correct" or "intended" way of arranging all 20 bobbleheads on it. And yep, even though it would still be more surfaces and textures to load, it would only be one object that the servers would need to record the position of, rather than *twenty-*one objects, so even though it might cost more than an empty stand does currently, I'd have to think it should cost less CAMP budget than a filled stand currently does.
---
Theoretically no, they will all be scaled down to you...
---
Looked like there is a metal wallpaper in the next SCORE Run.
---
All of the Fallout 4 building sets need to be added within the game and attainable through a nice little set of missions or through building a set amount of things in Workshops maybe. Not added to the Atomshop !  Bethesda need to give the great  builders and CAMP artists a bit more to work from...not everyone can afford to buy Atoms.
---
Kinda hard not to when all you have is useless non ad clearing teammates that don’t revive
---
960... Like it says... On the pic... 🤔
---
Makes you enjoy that click so much more.😁
---
I started a week ago and I'm at 31 on the run without trying to do them
---
In 1200 hours I would have never even thought of this. Wow
---
Depends on how irradiated you are becoming. More Rads per second = more health per second. Getting close to 6 Rads per second and balancing it out with Max Rank What Rads? will give you crazy health recovery.
---
I mean its not very bad but man what if i just want to skim the pass you know?
---
I save all my 308 and 10mm I have a good 10mm that is very fun to use even without perks 308 for a rmg I have nothing special hunters bash rw i think
---
I'd rather they didn't, thanks.
---
Deal with the ads yourself.
---
Yes buy from your friend
---
Good for you.
---
This is why we need:
---
a) "repair all" button and considering it was in nuked zone it should be free repair.
---
b) Some sort of assurance, this shouldn't even happen in the first place, i read that ladydevann was raising this up for devs, but that was nearly two weeks ago, hopefully they implement it next patch.
---
I’m on PS4 too. Those same high lvl players were still fuckin everybody up even before the gauss shotgun lmao
---
Well, nobody is buying ranks for the filer items either way, they're buying to get to something else after that.
---
At least the metal floors are pretty early in.
---
I burned about 30 mins on that thing.removed from camp I think I would rather drop or gift my ammo away that I dont use
---
I found one in a player vendor for 5k. Seemed reasonable to me so i bought it.
---
Other than that or trading, i don't think so.
---
That's what a candy thief would say.
---
Yup, I already did the math in the post. You're looking at Level 533 MINIMUM, if everything goes perfect and you don't ever respec your SPECIAL, keep spare cards, or lose Spare cards due to glitches.
---
its not. when someone shooting whole minute with plasma explosive gatling and npcs flying around. little explosion everywhere light effect, motion blur effect sound effect on every of them. IT CAUSE FPS drop. Basicly you lie to glorify broken weapon.
---
I know kinda rare to see a xmas one latley
---
Haha he doesn't wanna sell it to me cuz he likes it
---
Try not using Tesla’s at all and get some aim. So pathetic. Hope they nerf the ark like they say
---
It's updated manually each day, just wait a bit and you will see it jump.
---
...oh the downvotes I farmed saying that.
---
In your example, it would be all combat armor, regardless of weight. Or all Trapper, or all Solar, or all T-65 Power Armor, etc.
---
There's a chest with 500 caps in there???
---
Been on like, 8 successful runs now and didn't ever see it.
---
Where does this spawn?
---
Like if u were getting hit with a gamma gun which does 125 rads per shot ur not healing fast enough to survive right?
---
Good idea, thanks!
---
You must have loaded into the nuke dropping. If u load into a nuked zone you are prompted to find a new world. If you choose not too, tour camp is not damaged just inside the nuke / rad zone....
---
I will admit - a valentines bed in August is random af
---
lol yea it’s very cool looking. Just keep participating the event and you’ll get it for sure.
---
I’m was with you until you started blaming other players. The timer does suck but you going down isn’t anyone’s fault but your own.
---
Oh man, you're a bona fide genius!  I would never have thought of that.
---
Thank you, i will definitely follow your suggestion.
---
Lmao a visual slide show and a audio that sounds like a dj scratching a record it's a great time.
---
Well you may speak for yourself, but I know several people who bought the whole first season ASAP it was possible. Some of them claimed they dont have the time, others said they aren't up for the grind. There will be people who buy the entire season for sure, and if they do so they have to buy these filler aswell, meaning they DO buy stimpacks, rad-x and radaway for real money.
---
Sure literaly no one will buy it for these fillers alone, but still they pay for them. What if season 3 will have way more of this filler, replacing valuable stuff like atoms? If you accept their way to cheat on us, they will advance it and make it even more.
---
They do give you 1,600 atoms to be able to shop
---
It’s multiple things such as explosives certain location markers, etc but it generally comes to instance stability . If the server can’t handle it, then effects such a crippling can lead to the bug, which has already been used to forced Earle to clip into the ground. This is just a more severe consequence.
---
Thats what im gonna do sadly i have too
---
So when are they gonna actually fix the game pass version of 76 to make it playable, without having to delve deep into my computer and router settings?
---
It would be nearly impossible to do. You load into the world with 1 second before the nuke hits.
---
So from a programming point of view what is the test. Is the area nuked? Is the area about to be nuked? No ok load in... wait someone launches a nuke now.. and then what. You will be in the path of a nuke and you passed all the checks but still get your camp nuked...
---
10/frames what you got a nasa computer my Xbox one x is literally at 1 frame a minute.
---
Fr. I lost so much score throughout the pass. Luckily i still finished early
---
Save your cloth ;) I have a feeling we get this anyways :P
---
Yup, so glad I grinded it out for things that don’t work.
---
I've found the plans for the civil war era top hat, Confederate hat and Confederate uniform near Pickett's Fort since yesterday.
---
Black powder and pistols are given super high chance to drop from murmrgh, bundled with bashing feature. So be prepared physically and psychologically for the legendary grind. Eventually when you’re not paying attention she’ll suddenly drop you something very nice... but likely not for your build.
---
Private worlds should be persistent imo.
---
I hoping fallout shelters will be legit. I could spend days creating vaults.
---
I’m not too sure about a set level to buy them, but i can go to a couple of the vendors and see if I can buy the plan and then trade it to you if that helps?
---
Thats how i feel about half the stuff in this game. And yet I still come back to it for whatever reason
---
Depending on what level you are, thus how much XP do you need for the level up, you can just finish the run in time thanks to the double score dailies/weeklies:
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?nw&amp;level=50&amp;percent=0&amp;days=7&amp;xpgain=50000&amp;startrank=88&amp;dblxps=16&amp;dblxpe=20&amp;dblscs=1&amp;dblsce=8&amp;weeklyat=1&amp;bonusdaily](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?nw&amp;level=50&amp;percent=0&amp;days=7&amp;xpgain=50000&amp;startrank=88&amp;dblxps=16&amp;dblxpe=20&amp;dblscs=1&amp;dblsce=8&amp;weeklyat=1&amp;bonusdaily)
---
When you are fleeing from the mine, right before you exit to Appalachia there is a room that was closed off before.
---
The room has some junk and the chest in it. The chest usually has some stims, ore and 25-500 caps in it. 500 caps is obviously somewhat rare =p
---
Too bad the Purveyor sale gonna be on the week after. I left that 500 scrip unclaimed for nothing.
---
Morgantown Highschool and Ohio River Adventures for starters. Also, just explore.
---
I think, though I may be mistaken, that you need to unlock the other building types first. It seems like a lot of plans have hidden requirements.
---
If not you should be able to see them at whitesprings station.
---
Maybe you unequipped a perk card, lost a buff or anything else which modified the damage. I didn't noticed a difference.
---
Ehh that's like $50 worth of atoms even with discounts on them.
---
The rewards aren't that good that I'd pay $50 or more for them.
---
Crazy cat lady house and Morgantown highschool are where I go.
---
I don't think is necessary to know who bought the staff, I think should be useful to have a list to chech what Is missing and the sales price. This in my reason and I'm asking if someone else agree
---
I sometimes end up with giant stacks of it, and I'll sell it to the NPC vendor or just drop it somewhere.
---
If you are on PC I may have a plan you can have, I gotta log in and check
---
Looks like you could finish it today with the double score
---
They sure do, it feels like buying a good amount atoms to me with the FO1st benefits as a “bonus”. 
---
That’s kind of how I view the whole thing as I buy it every couple or so months.
---
Totally agree!!
---
I loved having people help me out and thumbs up whenever they help me take out a mob of high level ghouls.
---
I love returning the favor. I sell cheap plans and scrap in my camp. I have as many resources for new players as I can spare!
---
Double score this week too. 16k score with just weeklies
---
i know im delighted
---
i did spend 4000 atoms on it as i had a busy summer.
---
that damm thirst trap of a trap door
---
Yes they do. They Will probably learn when half their stash is filled with garage ammo. No one in their right mind would pay more than 3 caps for 1 round. But only when its ultracite or something uncommon
---
I want a companion similar to Dogmeat/ED-E that can follow you around and actually be of use as storage or in a fight.
---
My guy gets lonely when roaming around on his lonesome and a helpful friend/npc with basic dialogue options would be cool
---
Did you put it on the spot near cliffwatch or the one further south? I think we may be camp buddies!
---
That would be really helpful - although I'm not sure what the price is so I can't exactly guarantee I'd be able to pay you in full. Lol it's frustrating!
---
\*insert dumptruck ass joke here\*
---
You’ll be able (eventually) to have 86 ‘base’ perk points, for an average of 12.3. Add in all the other methods of having increased SPECIAL points and it’s even more. 
---
And the point was whether or not you could max out SPECIAL in games before FO4.
---
That would be awesome if I was on pc.
---
Ah that makes a lot of sense actually! I saw a lot of the other plans going for cheap at other players camps so I might try this
---
I finished it a week and a half ago, and the challenges are pointless now. 
---
I hope that they will at least have a period in between seasons when they'll do atom challenges for a while. I prefer being able to choose my own reward rather than getting some ugly skin for a weapon I don't use, etc.
---
I solo’d him yesterday and he did that a lot, also into the ceiling. Basically i just run around and shoot at him from different angles, he’ll try to attack and chase me, then eventually he’ll bump into some stepping geometry and come back up/drop down. Took me longer than expected but still got my one star ski sword, ghoul slayer tire iron and cursed axe when there’s five minutes left.
---
5 attempts into this event, and I've yet to see anything beyond a 6 second respawn length.
---

---
Ok I added you
---
While I share the sentiment I'm upset with all the little things that go unaddressed with every update. The game while enjoyable is an absolute disappointment when next to my expectations and further compounded by the obvious potential.
---
One small example being the timer to escape after colossal problem. Doesn't seem they even see an issue here. Except it keeps us from exploring (something most of us love to do) after we down the boss. My first run I was looting earl and was killed by a Wendigo and didn't get a quest completion (I was able to loot the legendary and a couple items before getting booted) after being warped out of the area and spawned in the middle of a nuke zone to die...
---
Minor inconveniences that ruin the experience are littered throughout almost every aspect of the game, the community is consistently vocal about these things but its never addressed. Its like part of the game design is to make things slightly worse than the should be. Look at what happened with Raids, The boroughs while somewhat successful is basically forgotten, why isn't there a mini boss or something that keeps us coming back to that location?
---
Now with every new feature for some reason they feel the need to tie a new currency with it. Even the legendary perks are going to have a currency tied to discarded cards instead of just points per level as if we haven't worked hard enough for that already. I'm ranting. I love playing the game but i'm so disappointed with how shit it is. This little mobile console hybrid fuck wanna be MMO. Its a slap in the face to fallout fans. I'm still going to play it forever though.
---
TLDR
---
I also pvp alot, and no. Any teslas can cause lag despite of the ammo capacity.
---
Well I disagree, vendors are implemented to prevent having to destroy unwanted stuff others could use. There is still no valid reason bethesda should implement something like that where they are still having to fix and implement more important stuff.
---
If you are looking for people who are only agreeing, you should stay away from the Internet and especially from reddit. This is no filterbubble for your own opinion.
---
roflol
---
Strange, I have no such problems on my I3, might be because I use a 1060gtx, 32gb ram, and have the game on my M2. But I admit I have that mod installed, because THE FLIES caused fps in the single digits.
---
And if sound effects really contribute to lag at your end, then there is something wrong with your hardware.
---
Edit: to be clear, I use a Be25 HM, not a legacy.

Very insightful.  Thank you. lol

Where is the Legendary exactly? I've been given this same advice several times, but in my dozens of visits to Whitesprings, I usually encounter mid-tier ghouls, with the occasional level 60+. I have yet to encounter a legendary
---
No worries, if I can find one you can have it free :) always happy to help out! I’ll log in now and have a look, what’s your ign? Add me, mine is shoooops
---
The ones you need are probably bear arms for reduced weapons weight of heavy guns, power user for longer lasting fusion cores, and maaaaybe power sprinter if you want it to help with fusion core drain while sprinting. The ones you want are fix it good to over repair your PA to 200%, power patcher, for cheaper repairs, power Smith for crafting PA with less mats. But those don't need to be equipped at all times, just when you need them but definitely keep bear arms snd power user on at all times.
---
48 is the damage a .50cal machine gun does with heavy barrel and no buffs though

It was datamined?

Dang... I actually got excited by the idea for a moment, I was going to grab it for my Slocum's Joe....
---
Depends on your inherent Rad Resistance. If you're in a Radiation/Stealth Suit or Power Armor, you might mitigate incoming Radiation Damage to survive a while from Regen.
---
But if that's pure oncoming damage? No, you're not surviving that.
---
Could be in Headwear
---
I noticed a bug where the damage changes if you don’t have the weapon you’re looking at equipped, you might be seeing the same bug
---
Have you been debuffed somehow? Are you currently using a legendary weapon with nocturnal?
---
Wish that date would come sooner.
---
I want my Commie Wood armor paint! It's the true Advanced Chinese Combat Armor!

I vendored a bloodied handmade 1\* since I did not know what it was...

IIRC from another character, getting into Dome 2 just required a mini quest of collecting notes/passwords/keys etc.

Damage debuff like a sickness or something? Idk, can't confirm any stealth nerf yet.
---
Yeah it was honestly quite easy to complete without spending a single Atom.
---
Hell, I’d pay to use that jukebox.
---
I'm referring to the point where those chain things appear
---
If he has a nocturnal weapon in hand that might be it
---
I knew an emperor who had those exact robes
---
I thought the ranger armor was still available. I think I got 1st three months ago, and I got it.
---
The exclusive items are pretty weak. It does give you a good deal on atoms, especially since you can barely get them through challenges now. The scrapbox is excellent (though some skins wouldn't hurt), and the tent is handy.
---
I'm satisfied with it, all in all.
---
Me too, when I saw the new one I checked it out and it didn’t say what music it can play so I came here before I purchased it to see if anyone had any reviews for it, I’m glad I did
---
It’s probably because i’m on mobile, but... I just recently got it to where I can see where the progress bar WOULD go, but i’ve never actually been able to see the bar... perhaps it’s just my cookies or something now.
---
OP obviously doesn’t have what ZAX is looking for in an overseer. 
---
With that said, there’s a bunch of us who don’t mind shooting at an oversized head, much less have a problem with it. Lol
---
🤣☠️
---
Yes this is what I understood too after googling, but it's not present for myself.   
---
Another comment suggested that you may need to have the previous plans before certain ones will show, so I might try this
---
No

Pro tip: asbestos lining armor
---
Oh wow thank you! That's really kind of you, 
---
I'll add you now, you can simply join my private world if you like.
---
Raid West Tek and other supermutant spawn locations. Loot their energy weapons and scrap with the scrapper perk.
---
I rarely use my cloth though. I would also feel bad if they didn’t unlock the Collectron, and I hadn’t even attempted to donate.
---
Can you post a picture of the guns, your perk loadout and your active effects tab from the Pip-boy?
---
Afaik they can't change weapon damage without a client-side patch and there was none in the past week or so.
---
I think in the PTS (or datamined from the PTS) there are mannequin stands.
---
So they're definitely working on it.
---
Honestly, I'd rather just have it give 90% reduction on all ammo. It would make life so much easier to not have to carry a bunch of ammo weight perks...
---
Cool! I’ve found the plans for you, what’s your ign? I need to add you otherwise the request doesn’t show for me 🙈
---
To be fair it can be another players fault,I had a nice spot away from everyone else firing an explosive weapon and someone stands right infront of me. Stuck on re spawn screen, I just logged off at that point ,haven’t returned since.
---
And the original original point was that changing builds is too punishing, if you wanted a max stats build in 3 you'd need to make max stats your build
---
Honestly 76 is so drastically different from the normal fallout way that it's a spinoff 
---
This game let's you change Special at will, letting you change builds multiple times. No other fallout game let you do that (besides 4 and 76 that have no level limit)
---
I’m still gonna get it because I think it’d look nice in my character’s bar, but the fact that it still plays the default music just bums me out.
---
Dude you are level 360. Go outside.
---
Atoms, no. They were making a massive mistake giving so many out for free previously.   
---
Something else? Scrip? Gold? etc? Now you're getting somewhere!
---
Why didn't you download them to your computer?
---
Wasn't the bunker 500?
---
even better live testing in the PTS
---
i saw footage from juicehead i believe
---
Nein i mean no !!!
---
I'm not using nocturnal.  I have 8 perk loadouts, and your clue made me check them.  I can increase the damage to 37 by selecting the armor repair loadout instead of the heavy gunner loadout.  Looks like I need to start a new loadout and add cards one-by-one until I can identify the problem.  Thanks!
---
Also while I'm at it... Give us a blasted weight reduction perk for rifles already!
---
No it hasn’t been fixed everything still floats.
---
It would be convenient,  but also OP when compared to the other packs. It would save you 8 perk points, while the others reduce 3 at best.
---
I think ultracite can use the atomic onslaught paints. Seems like I unlocked it yesterday. Not very original though I know.
---
Im assuming you want to get the conversion mod for the alien blaster, i had like 4 a while back and I either dropped most of them or tried to sell them for cheap because my buddy kept getting it and dropping them in my base.
---
Whole I figured it would only play classical.
---
I do agree with this! I mean it’s a Jukebox!
---
I keep a spreadsheet of items in my vending machines and try to update it every couple of days that I'm on, but it's really tedious.  I'd love to have a sales history option.
---
They appear in different places, but I typically find at least one in the restaurant building near the tennis court and at least one in the maintenance building near the parking lot.  Others do appear in the cabins on the walkways and inside the shops.  The toy shop with the Christmas tree has one at times.
---
You are stressing me !!!
---
Opposite problem for me.
---
Im on pc with an xbox controller, since I disabled vsync inside the config file the cursor is way too fast (capped frames at 144fps so its almost trackable).
---
The cursor speed is tied to the framerate for reasons only todd knows, and if you have 30 or less frames per second the cursor will be slower then with 60fps.
---
If the xbox isn't capped, try to look up the sky when open the map. This will result in a higher framerate and with that the cursor should be faster.
---
Ah right I didn't realise!
---
It's Cpt.Bishop
---
:D
---
I want some unarmed skins for my mole miner and deathclaw gauntlets!
---
Thanks for the suggestion.  It looks like its the perk loadout; I'll have to dissect each one to see what the deal is.
---
Where in the savage divide for the other 2. I only know of 2 spots, is there anymore than that? Cause I've had zero luck.
---
Always look for a good group running ACP. Lots of ppl playing it as the wendi spawn junk reward already makes up for the caps spent on nuke keycards and you get a lot of your ammo back. I find group all the time that can finish in under 10mins
---
What are you on? If it’s PlayStation they are in your gallery on your console still. Can’t say about Xbox or pc
---
I’m surprised they finally fixed the teaming issue when the match is over... having to re-invite teammates after every match was getting old...And of course, remember the damn settings.
---
Yeah! I was very shocked and pleased to see double score week im 101 level now leveled up so quick doing the legendary run and i think i wont need to buy atoms for rank. Thanks btw :)
---
Other than the atomic onslaught skin which was added in the first battle pass obviously there is only one other skin for ultracite which is atomic shop exclusive and that’s it.
---
They are coming.
---
Cool!  I'll hold off scrapping them a bit longer.  :)
---
I mean, I hear good things about junkie's/explosive paddle balls...
---
Yes. Every fucking time. I turn it off and turn on my radios so I can actually hear different songs. Leave and come back and it's playing again. You can even see a bunch of music different cartridges in it but no, gotta keep playing one song over and over.
---
On PC they’ll be in the game folder somewhere. If they aren’t it’s likely a system faliure rather than a game one
---
Nw, I’ll be with you in a few mins :)
---
The fillers don't cost anything to develop, so they likely have the current rank cost set to coincide with the development cost of the feature items. My thoughts are if they increased the number of feature items they'd probably either increase atom cost for ranks or have to charge a base fee for the season. So being that they want to keep the season free and ranks relatively cheap that's probably dictating the need to limit the number of feature items.
---
Its not the map. My cursor moves at a normal speed on the map. But in the battle pass screen its super slow. No matter what i do.
---
What weapon are you using to cripple him I don't seem to be having any luck with my quad double barrel.
---
And I’m not sure if you already know, double score for daily and weekly challenges until the eighth
---
edit...I think they’re trying to make up for lost score for so many people
---
Ya, you don't see people running ultracite often which is a shame.
---
I feel like the dude rocking out is bordering on "false advertising" since there's no description of what it plays and by that image alone the average person could be lead to believe that it plays good music not the Todd Special Lunchtime Elevator Muzzak.
---
I ran out of maths... how many days is that then? 70?
---
I mostly got just junk, stopped after the third or fourth time.
---
Please put Secret Service Under-armor Camo paint on shop again.
---
It happens when you keep shooting even when everything begins to lag
---
PC.
---
50 is technically max level, but it's hard to have your build and gear really optimized at that level. With my first character, I tried to be a good all-around build without specializing too much. I could do pretty decent damage and not die often, but I was definitely not a real heavy hitter.
---
Now I've made a more specialized build and gotten gear to match, and I can kill a scorchbeast in two hits. (If I swapped a couple cards and used some chems etc I might one shot it.) 
---
You'll get better over time. Just have fun and don't wear yourself out grinding.
---
 It's the only thing I wanted out of this whole mess.
---
I wonder if they're going to move around your camp
---
Damn, was gonna say I'd place which ever ones you wanted in your CAMP till you found the plan.
---
This. if there's not at least three level 200+ and a 300+, I don't join the event.
---
Coming with PA displays, however I imagine they use a lot of budget...
---
Same here. Planetarium lamp doesn't display Stars, Captain Cosmos gameboard is invisible when placed on a wall and my future-tec camp machine made it so my camp no longer shows up on the map.
---
Maybe they can also fix my Nuka Cola projection lamp, constantly disappearing pets and 100 other things while they're at it.
---
sure. are you on pc?
---
finished yesterday 
---
still doing the daily's  though
---
I forgot that was a plan. I thought it was "included" as a mod option for the Blaster. I was meaning to re-supply with AB rounds because the damage drop-off to Energy Cells was pretty drastic IIRC.
---
I've done it once or twice on previous characters, I'm sure I can get in there easy enough. Thanks for the offer tho.
---
I found the corpse recently on the road near the dam.
---
Apologies dude, I'm on xbox.just updated post.
---
We do not know when Season 2 is starting.
---
Came here to say this, with luck you can arrange it so your fear runs get interrupted by the cave walls and just stay in there except to pop out and empty a clip into him.
---
I’ve only seen a couple people wearing strangler and if there’s more people they must be using overhaul skins maybe but to be honest I don’t see many if almost any people running power armour anymore secret service armour really ruined along with lack of updates to improve PA overall.
---
Enjoy :)
---
Thanks so much man! 
---
Helped out a new player a ton!
---
The problem with any other display is you still need to define all the individual objects. Your comic book rack is going to have different items in it from someone else's comic book rack. So each comic book would still have to be its own object. 
---
Specifically for a complete bobblehead collection, there is only one configuration. So a single "object" could be made that has all the bobbleheads on it. Presumably this would be simpler than having the system try to render 21 objects, and would take up less build space.
---
Or continue using them until Bethesda is forced to fix THEIR issue.
---
I hope there is a break, I haven’t even played since completing it other than to turn in for scrip and bullion.
---
I'm not looking for people who only agree and I accept your point of view. As you, I replied trying to explain my opinion. So relax, remember that we are talking about a game, and if you don't like my post no problem
---
That's a weirdly specific change 
---
It should be 48, you are right about that
---
This could have been implemented as an actual decent Legendary Perk, instead of the 3 PA ones we will get.
---
At least Funky Duds will benefit PA, since poison was pretty much the only thing that could kill you.
---
Oh thats also not tied to fallout 1st but to the battle pass system
---
Good to know, B-SS-+STR Power Fist is my white whale.
---
You got this, but man is it gonna be close
---
More than welcome, have fun building!!
---
Man I was looking forward to having 20/strength was going to use the extra perks points to equip weight carrying perk cards damm it.
---
My wife was watching me play the event over my shoulders on PC and at one point the frame rate got so bad the entire screen was moving blocks and pixels. As she questioned "what is that?" i almost forgot I was playing Fallout and not watching censored Japanese porn.
---
Ah, good luck anyway
---
Appreciate it. 👍
---
You can sell it to an npc vendor?
---
Yeah I've just gotten into the habit of changing my icon back because I know it's been changed to what I just got.
---
Hey, If I gotta switch it up and wear some Unyielding and go bloody for a week. So. Be. It.
---
Same been working out a build with 20 strength damm it.
---
I believe somebody said that there’s a break, that’s playing on the PTS
---
Right the Bobblehead one is most obvious, but something similar can be done with the comic or magazine racks, just to give us the options in a smaller budget cost.
---
Yea its pretty drastic, my lvl 50 only does like 20 damage I believe.
---
Oh, interesting. Sorry for the misunderstanding, for me the cursor is as fast for both interfaces, so i assumed its the same.
---
Its chill my wording could of been better 😂
---
Pa skins only tend to work of t 65 if they explicitly say so.
---
I’m actually done with the break already, bring on season 2....
---
Wow lame stuff
---
It's impossible to know until it drops
---
I can't wait for the new bugs it's going to add
---
Is it just me who preferred Mugsy?
---
That sounds like a great idea.
---
This. I'm ready to grind again. I want that glass house set!!!
---
To receive the 3*, you only need to complete the event successfully and remain in the event area (Monongah Mine interior or exterior, either works) until the "escape the mine" timer concludes.
---
Muggy was pretty funny. I think my favorites were the toaster and the seed cloning machine though.
---
Why are you the way that you are.
---
Well they said there was going to be a break between seasons when they launched the Legendary Run
---
If I recall 2 week break then season 2 starts september 22. Trying to find a source atm
---
I want my VIM cola power armour paint.
---
Yes, they'll buy it for a few caps.
---
Typically most battle passes start the day following the end of the preceding pass but it's hard to say what Bethesda has planned. Maybe it will start the same day the new patch drops.
---
Watoga high school... just don’t go during monster mash.... their cafeteria has a ton...
---
👍🏻
---
I could swear that was already a thing.
---
its a joke... the image in the camp build menu is of the back of the jukebox somehow? it plays the same list as the regular jukebox, its not worth buying.  i might have to request my first refund...
---
Weird.  Maybe I’ll try selling it for a cap a piece next time.  It’s just so heavy I usually dump it
---
I love how Blood Sacrifice basically screws Berserkers.
---
That reduced ap consumption while sprinting in power armor looks very nice as well as the ammo factory. Ima grab that ammo factory first then the power armor one.
---
Ah, after the first run I've always stayed to the end looting Wendigos.
---
Nice to know there's an incentive to escape
---
If it is I missed it then when I couldn’t play.  I know there’s a few nuka cola paint jobs though.
---
I'm in!!
---
I mean...it never bothered me too much, I just try to stay as close as possible while fighting a mirelurk queen.  She doesn't spit on you if you get up in her face.
---
And I just run screaming when I see a blood bug or stingwing.  Oddly enough I rarely have trouble with Radscorpions.
---
Nope. [https://youtu.be/W4pkPMl7TP4?t=23](https://youtu.be/W4pkPMl7TP4?t=23)
---
Cool thanks bro!
---
Hey we're at the same spot! Congrats on that grind, man! I was starting to doubt that I'd finish the run before I logged in today and read that we've got double SCORE now. I'm relieved I can stop counting atoms and maybe buy something else instead of closing the gap with Zorbo.
---
I would have no problem having my own moo moo following if it helps with the weight lol
---
100k ammo, and caps
---
3 bloodied explosive reduced wheight guns
---
And a preserved pie
---
Ah bit disappointing. Hate floating foundations. Agree that from the ground it'd probably look fine but yeah, rather it look more realistic
---
If you agree, what's the point of this post?
---
Integrated weapons mod - goes in the arm slot, reduces fusion core consumption in V.A.T.S. by 50%, reduces vats cost by 12%
---
Separate Camo for T-65 is a bit of a dick move since there is already multiple Camo bundles...
---
Nah I don't PvP and when I do I iron sights as it's over so fast if you don't get shots on target straight away.
---
My rubber banding is more bigger critters that will go back to full health after being hit almost immediately. Or keep regenerating chunks quickly.
---
My VATS will make the 'thud' noise and targets stay at full health. Like in meat weat I was shooting level 20 wolves in the forest with VATS and five shots later it actually registered it should be dead. Was total bullshit.
---
Cool, thank you for confirming that.
---
Lol I’d let ‘em waste the keycard and the time that they’ll never get back while running the silo. The threat of nuclear hellfire loses some of its *oompf* when there’s a two minute countdown and you have the ability to server hop and nullify the threat.
---
Hold on to your lug nuts! It's time for an overhaul!
---
 Darude – Sandstorm
---
Getting done with the legendary run has been great. Don’t ACP three times and haven’t played for two straight weeks otherwise. Nice break
---
They weren't giving out "SO MANY"... Some would argue they weren't giving enough. Nevertheless it drove people to finish the challenges to get stuff from the Atom shop before it disappeared for 6+ months.
---
A skin for the jetpack? It sounds like there was the mod itself included, but I am afraid to try it, because I am not interested in the camo skin itself...
---
I may be mistaken. There are several nuka cola paint jobs. I know there was SOMETHING for VIM, it may have just been a sign or something.
---
Both the slots and perks , I enjoy playing multiple builds and this system seems to discourage that
---
I finished back during the first week of August... think of all the atoms I could have
---
Dudes i just had a cool idea. What if there were a card for power armor users that made it so when using VAATS it would consume less fusion core charge? Just a thought
---
It feels like it's lagging and moving at 5 frames per second
---
I got all the rewards from hitting that event like 20 times... probably never do it again.
---
Ikr so its not just me.
---
and my Axe! 
---
(Gimli is the grumpiest of old men/dwarves)
---
Russel Dorsey stole it all
---
Where did I dispute anything about the primary premise of the OP?  I was specifically replying to your comment.
---
Isn't it suppressed though?
---
same horrible classic music as the one already in game
---
This encounter always makes me chuckle.
---
Filthy, underequipped, beat-up scavver: *you look like you’ve seen some shit*
---
Freakishly mutated vault dweller covered in weapons and wearing a clown hat: *I’ve had better days.*
---
You're asking too much.
---
That would be pretty sweet! I'd love a shadowy mist around the weapon. How about you?
---
*\*Thinks about 500 atoms\**
---
That sucks. It's a really cool looking jukebox. They should let you pick, like the radios
---
This totally makes up for every single mistake bethesda has ever made!
---
Thanks for the warning. It looks nice, but I probably won't spend atoms on it. I'm already tired of having to turn off my existing jukebox every time I go back to camp. Nothing against classical music, but it's the same music over and over and over...
---
I'm afraid to go look now...
---
No. It is hardened, with aligned short barrel, drum mag, sighted and 500 atoms for freaking black paint.
---
As opposed to the western revolver that doesn't have a suppressor?
---
Keep those infernal things in Vegas. Evil freaking murder bugs.
---
It would be neat if they could use the framework for the talking history with npcs for this.  Then people who want to see a history of their actions could and those that don’t, won’t.
---
I have a hard time actually getting any 2mm EC ammo from them when I'm shooting gauss weapons. They very rarely have any for me. And when I use the primed plasma caster, I get completely random ammo of all types EXCEPT ultracite plasma cartridges.
---
Requisitioned for the BOS.
---
All the gunslingers I've seen use it rapid fire and get sneak attacks, I think you are using it wrong
---
This is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Of all the enemies I'd like to see or new ideas they could explore, those are the absolute last thing on my list
---
It takes 15-20 seconds to scroll from one side to the other for me
---
Or maybe Rock and Roll. You know, like an ACTUAL jukebox. FFS.
---
Johnny Cash - Ring of Fire
---
Risky. I would hate to end a space or two short after buying some other overpriced atx stuff. I am officially avoiding any unnecessary atomic purchases just in case I need them to finish future seasons and I have over 16,000 stored, so I do have a bit of a buffer built up.
---
Toaster as an ally. The only ally I would ever need.
---
When you fast travel in to Hemlock Holes, turn around 180 degrees and travel up the road until you get a random encounter up a slight hill. I've gotten all of mine there. I just hop in every time I'm in the game.
---
It was that damn Carole Baskin. I will never financially recover from this.
---
Yes.  :)
---
Thanks for the confirmation. I've made it to level 90, which given I missed two weeks when moving flat isn't bad (though I only lost one set of weeklies with how the exact dates lined up). I wasn't expecting to finish the run and it looks like I won't, but I'm surprised how far I've got while not powerlevelling and missing the odd day in addition to the two week break.
---
Probably not going to spend atoms to finish. But I might spend some to get to level 95 if I don't get there properly. Those cards could be useful for turning into perk coins soon.
---
That bastard
---
At least you can spend the 1st atoms to compensate this bug. Welcome to the ultimate fallout online experience!
---
/s
---
I meant that I finished it earlier thinking I had to log in daily. Thanks to r/fo76 for freaking out in the beginning haha.
---
You're not wrong. Realistically I'm way too paranoid and probably won't buy anything until after I'm really done with it. 😂
---
My cursor is moving at like 3-4 frames and thats sad.
---
So sneak attack everything? That doesn't sound like the Clint Eastwood cowboy I'm trying to role play. IDK, maybe I'll just stick to shotgun.
---
All the Sink appliances would be great, honestly.
---
Bethesda should really think about giving us more animated CAMP items rather than just new Collectrons, of which only one can be placed at a time.
---
I know the reason of that is that each item would be an NPC and that's extremely taxing on servers, but depending on how instanced CAMPs work they could be interior only items, and it could just work.
---
Yup!
---
Is there a cost to swap out a legendary perk? Or does that work like normal perks?
---
Never knew this, someone missed out on a really good sale of that weapon then lol thanks!
---
The toaster is no one's ally. They are tools of convenience while he figures out how to tap into the main reactors.
---
You sn   cadbvvvfvcvvccccccccccccdd
---

---
Yeah when the last dupe thing was happening I was down in watoga and I went to vendor and they had a 3 star magic junkies mini and a junkies 2 star gat plasma I paid 4k caps for and love them.
---
Xbox :/ I only had a few screenshotted to share
---
Nice you got some bargains!!
---
Morgantown HS (all over not just the cafeteria but the cafeteria has a ton), the Cat Lady House, and the Golf Course. Sometimes there's a lot of golf tees and balls in the Hemlock Holes clubhouse. There's also a good amount of golf balls just to the south of the Ohio River Adventures.
---
Just leave them there with Earle. They certainly aren't gonna kill him with a Tesla. They're just along for the free ride. If I see a Tesla there I just fast travel out. It's not worth the ammo.
---
I did this as well. It's nice to have two characters with very different play styles in my opinion. I've got bloodied commando, and a bloodied heavy gunner.
---
Also, legendary perks will punish people who change their builds so much.
---
this is why we can't have nice things, buddy. crazies like you!
---
Also, two shot isn't actually that good of a perk anymore 
---
The Gauss pistol is a high damage stealth weapon, especially with a bloodied build where it can kill the queen very quickly
---
Some of us just don't have room for caps or for guns just sitting in our stash, so we sell em cheap at vendors. Sometimes someone finds gold!
---
Yesss 500 lovely atoms would be niceeee
---
Be grateful for all the great stuff they give us for free you ungrateful grumpy player 😡 (jks lol for all the sh** they did to their loyal player base they should hand out sh** like badsh** crazy)
---
I’m definitely not complaining about that, lucky to be the one that came across it!
---
Indeed I have! It's so awesome when you go to place it, proud to have earned the stupid thing, just to be left with an outline, or nothing at all there instead! Super gratifying.
---
Oh okay... Thank you for the information. But I personally don't like the idea of them.
---
But I came late to the Fallout franchise. I tried to play the first game a few times but gave up eventually. 😔
---
Why would you ask for something like that mate?
---
So, the grinding continues...
---
don't forget the life preservers at hemlock holes in the pool room. 2 plastic each.
---
Umm... what?
---
&lt;no image&gt;
---
So many combinations, so few good combinations, everything has equal chance. Grind away fellow wastelander.
---
I'm huntin' bugs, I'm huntin' bugs, out here in Appalachia there are only cazadors since they killed all the competition.
---
Cant they havent been made yet same way jet doesnt exist yet.
---
Don't make mega-sloth work for things!
---
i'd have to see a picture
---
Now everyone can see our greatest achievement... the outline of the frame!
---
Since the 2 shot nerf ages ago things like bloodied, junkies and anti armour became far better
---
Read the title... All I heard was Count from Sesame Street....
---
*A one wasteland.....*
---
*A two wasteland.....*
---
*A three wasteland, a-ha-ha....*
---
You just click it again. On Xbox press A to claim the free icon, it auto equips, then press A again to unequip. 
---
Admittedly, I haven't checked as to what icon it reverts back to.
---
I like to camp in bushes for the first bits of the match, but when the circle starts to get smaller, I usually come out and at least try. If I'm matched with a team that looks like they're actually going to work like a team, though, you can bet your sweet butt I'll be right there with them, and usually will wind up getting killed trying to revive a teammate that goes down. That has happened quite a few times, but I'm still going to do my level best to kill the others and get them up if I can. It's really just a crapshoot, though, with the team matching stuff.
---
"Green shit", really?
---
PSA, place a normal painting roughly the same size then place the gameboard on top of the painting. No more disappearing gameboard. Youre welcome!
---
I love this suggestion. It is delightfully sadistic. &lt;3
---
The pic in the atom shop has the dude in the “rockin out” pose. HIGHLY misleading. TOTAL bullshit. “My jukebox only plays classical” is all I need to hear to want to leave wherever I’m at. It’s damn near blasphemy not having rock on a jukebox. We’ve let this go on long enough.
---
Will the Sequin Dress ever make a return to the atom shop? Seems like it's never coming back from the first wave of cosmetics :c
---
I mean food is more a utility than luxury :)
---
I lost them too. Had to reinstall due to a post crash problem and the pics were gone
---
So the jukebox would act as the bobbleheads/ magazine displays? Honestly wouldn't mind that.
---
Yeah, cause the Scorched plague accidentally left a couple of people alive...
---
I’ve posted it
---
It is symbolism or something. Like, we were the assholes in the mine. And there are no bigger assholes than ourselves.
---
I'll have to try that
---
I have a field jacket, but I'm not sure if it's tattered.
---
I think it happened due to the new console update :/ this shit sucks
---
There’s a respond timer? 😎
---
A rad scorpion named bill. +100 carry weight.
---
Try removing the outer walls first and see if that works.
---
It's currently 1 Perk Coin. I updated the post with that information now.
---
Plus, there is a chance of getting a rare baseball bat.
---
xD
---
This was my exact experience, idk if it was Handy poster though, probably a cat one.
---
But but the fps bro. Gotta have 120 unnecessary fps.
---
Part of why some people think you’re better off purchasing legendary modules and spending them on crafting your own gear earned through the wastelander’s factions. Much higher % chance of getting the time you want. Albeit, if it has good stats but just doesn’t have the effects you want there’s no way for you to trade for the item you’re wanting as they’re all account-locked.
---
Frankenstein's monster but way cooler, and not in black and white.
---
Uh oh, thanks for the warning at least. I’ll take screenshots of my screenshots as backup. Sorry about your photos ☹️
---
Crotchety middle life mother also agrees
---
Pool tables (all the balls scrap to plastic), life preservers, the cat house.  Morgantown HS gym...
---
Ugh, I just want to know already! Lol
---
Not true, old skins that work on excavator tend to work on t65
---
Do you own the skin?
---
I placed my weapon rack with the Grognak Axe then re logging in the rack was inside the wall showing only the axe which actually looks much better.
---
But how would they do this for comic/magazine racks? There are more magazines than a single rack can hold. So they can't "easily" make the rack a single object. Or am I missing something?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Dibs on ***Mr. Furious***!
---
I've had the pride flag icon on for a few days now and I'm new so I have no idea how to change it lol
---
I do not, because it didn’t work on the T-65...no reason to buy it.
---
I mean meshes that just recolor the pa.  Not full reskins.
---
Pics.
---
I’ll give it a try
---
If you want to refarm your steel quick you can farm west tek and collect all weapons and recycle them at workbench with the recycler perk
---
Raider power armour skins..
---
That's why I play solo. My teammates either get me killed or are hiding in a bush on the other side of the map.
---
i'm lv97 without doing any nw and starting half way 2nd week of the legendary run bc Minecraft nether updated consumed my life the first and half week back then lmao
---
Literally the raider skins and the black rider paint work on it
---
If you don’t know then it’s not that helpful is it
---
I just go and do ACP first. Usually only takes 5-10 mins. Then I jump to the queen. Did this today actually, killed 4 WC and 2 SBQ in an hour. Last queen launch actually spawned another WC by fissure prime. Was a nice surprise.
---
Not to mention suddenly all the claimed workshops are yours too!....no wait a minute, stop shooting me....
---
(Bring back centaurs)
---
Those skins suck. Why would I put them on a T65?
---
I have had this happen for two reasons:
---
1) you killed the target...well, you were SUPPOSED to have killed the target but their health rubber banded and they are still alive...
---
2) you lost line of sight to the target for a split second.
---
Sure.  If you're an alcoholic.
---
#**LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE!**
---
“Paints” only work on the relevant models...and the T65 isn’t one of them,
---
Does it look like this?
---
My son's screen looks like that, and he plays beside me. I can't even look, it gives me anxiety.
---
That’s not the point is it, the point is they don’t have t65 in the description yet they still work, because they’re older skins, so move your attitude somewhere else
---
Anything that completely changes the whole design of the pa will work.  Anything that just paints over the armor won't.
---
Well as already stated that’s not true is it
---
It Just Works!^TM
---
This hasn’t happened to me, but a glitch that has happened is once I run out of ap or the target dies I still have the vats filter on
---
Visually; It's like someone chewing with their mouth open.
---
Skins aren’t paints...how hard is that to understand?
---
The Raider “skins” aren’t paints.
---
Haha I guess you’re right on that.
---
I’m sorry, the what? You say that as if it’s just something you’d say in just any conversation. Please elaborate.
---
Bro wtf.....thats where u set up my camp (just west near the lead deposit) and i frequent that spot all the time for the nuka/event then hit up ripper alley on my way to west tek....great little route. theres also a deathclaw on the ledge of the mountain just soutish of west tek that has a weird lookin shrine with a chem box, great for photo ops.
---
it's definitely not the second one, they'll be right in front of me clear shot and it happens. i suppose it could be the first one, but I've never visually seen it rubberband when it kicks me so i don't know. i just know it's making me waste ammo when my automatic handmade keeps firing as though I'm locked on when I'm not and they don't hit.
---
I reeeealllly want to be able to get a robot ally if we ever get this option. Appalachia is full of them to so it would make perfect sense if we could rewire one etc, sorta like the fallout 4 dlc that allowed us to basically create our own robot.
---
I’ve been wishing they would bring the vintage linen coat back to the atomic shop, along with the pink sun hat!
---
Why?
---
Oh of course. I didn’t think of doing it the other way round!
---
Oh god please! There is nothing better then light wood laminate!
---
I just want them to fix wallpapers...
---
You first...because you don’t know the difference between skins and paints.
---
Feel foolish yet?
---
It's a useful gun. It would be much better if they would fix it instead.
---
To answer/resond rosome of your questions/statements.   Firstly,  yes it is a bit sadistic to ask for the return of my sworn NV nemisis, but this is a a harsh world with ever evolving nightmarish creatures.
---
I also see these monstrosities as being a viable threat to the scorched beasts, imagine that the cazadores are a mutated version of the tarantula hawk wasp. They could disable (temporarily) a SB and lay eggs in it.  Then you could possibly fight a parasitic host SB that upon death bursts open expelling wasp larvae or possibly a full on legendary cazadore.
---
Unless you like an unplayable mess, then yes
---
What platform?  I have been booted on PS4 also.
---
I’m looking to have it confirmed by someone who actually owns it so bye
---
All challenges are doubled this final week. The Run ends on September 8th.
---
Your platform has nothing to do with it, either.
---
Yea. Thats what i was told to do. Simply because ACP will despawn after 5 mins, where as the queen will still be flying around up until the last second of the event.
---
Any chance you have a source?
---
Does it say it does? Because if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.
---
Sept 8 is last day
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iknqig/official_end_date_for_the_legendary_run_september/
---
Say less
---
Same.
---
I was going to stop after the Legendary Run, then my brother started to play. So, maybe try to find other players.
---
Actually, why don’t you spend your atoms on it and find out?
---
Since you don’t seem to want to listen to people who know better than you.
---
You know what I want is a "mud and blood" skin for a 50 cal.  What one might look like after it's been on the western front for 4 years.
---
A lot is going to change but bloodied will still be king. Anti armor is also worth looking into.
---
Same reason i run around Appalachia with a bloodied Mirv and around a 100 mini nukes. I want to see the server 🔥 🔥 🔥
---
Can't force it, that way lies madness. Give it a break, great opportunity to develop self-control.
---
No one asked you.
---
[REDACTED]
---
I enjoy the challenge, and chaos such a thing would bring
---
you don't think shop owners wanting to know what items their customers are buying most is useful information? plenty of people spend a lot of game time on buying selling and trading through vending machines and it'd be very helpful for us to be able to see at a glance what's selling best and what's stagnant, price trends etc.
---
I just want a juke that will play the stuff from the Son of Dane Compound.
---
Yeah you'll be fine, I'm in the PTS. I use a non legendary flamer and completed the daily ops with one other team mate.
---
They have a daily ops public team so it will be easy to team up before the daily ops :)
---
Yeah, that makes so much more sense
---
They would spread faster than a locust plague
---
I agree it would help against the smaller Wendigos if it actually worked. I still use mine at camp fire tales.  it's been awhile and still hasn't been addressed probably never will.
---
xbox
---
The uncharged damage is doing less than intended and it is heavily bugged in vats
---
Thank you very much!! Sorry for all the questions!
---
Look at the world we play in, all of our "nice" things are typically obtained through murder...
---
It's literally on the splash screen.
---
PvP, trade for new gear and weapons, grind xp, experiment with new builds, go help new players...
---
I keep scrapper on for this reason and I doubt I’ll ever have a need for the hoard of steel I’m sitting on.
---
WESTEK and sugar Grove, oooh yeah.
---
Meh, Beths has broken lore before
---
What’s even shadier is that they decided to use a character doing the air guitar emote as one of the demo pictures before the purchase
---
There are npc teammates? I thought they just slept at your camp
---
War crimes and murder
---
A 3rd option while unlikely but is possible is your physical button acting up? Try another controller.
---
Other players can buy those items, yes. Sometimes people sell legendaries in there because they hit their scrip limit and don't have room for them. (I have mules I keep them on, but hey, I'm a hoarder LOL) Enjoy the deals!
---
And now those 2 survivors mustbfend off plagues of murder hornets
---
For junkshield I have no idea, I think it works for the stacks you have in your inventory. 1 steel, 1 lead and one cork as example should do the trick to get the max benefits.
---
Serendipity has no cooldown, sometimes it procs within 2 seconds or not at all... I mostly get the proc when taking damage out of combat like falldamage, but I don't know either if I just miss the popup infight mostly.
---
Lone wanderer only affects the group, you cant have a companion without right now except for the campitem which is not directly a companion more a camp item. Only when you are not in a group the perk will work (note you can also be alone in a group when party members disconnect or you are in a public team, this will disable the perk aswell).
---
Glad I got this after five events. It’s def my new favorite headwear to wear
---
Unless you’re using a legacy explosive energy weapon, you can either use a dense torso armor mod or the Fireproof perk to immunize yourself from explosive damage, including your own.
---
And season two had better be starting on September 9th after playing this game for the last 6 months and having it be my first time being involved in the Fallout Universe I absolutely love the Brotherhood of Steel and but now know that there are items for the Brotherhood of Steel and other badass looking items for our camps and whatnot I cannot wait one day longer for season one to End season 2 begin
---
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
---
Fixer user waves hand.
---
Or 5 different variations of power armor that all look the same except for the huge bulky white space suit?
---
The worst part of both worlds.
---
That seems like poor logic. You can of course use ATOMS to pick up progression.  Additionally, between now and the 8th (end of the season) there's double SCORE going on, on top of extra challenges so you can likely progress very far if you work the dailies.
---
I'd love to see a group of centaurs face off against some snallygasters
---
I will put it this way.
---
Junk shield is useless. Serendipity is a must on bloodied builds and pretty good otherwise, no cool down . And lone wanderer works any time you are not on a team with other players.
---
I've kind of developed a theory that seems to pan out. if you get shite on your first roll, stop, don't keep rolling hoping for better. jump servers and try again. it seems to work like slot machines in Vegas - if they're not hot, no amount of quarters will make them spin up a win, so move on to another machine instead of digging your heels in. 
---
in other words, find a hot server and spend your rolls there.
---
I almost bought the last 10 levels last night, thank god I waited for Atomic Shop reset
---
Grief people
---
You wanna do WHAT?
---
nah, my controller is fine, i play lots of other games and no issues.
---
what i have depends on what i can find at the time, and it seems to change from time to time.  Good With Salt doesn't work forever, so as soon as i can, i craft a stable flux.  Bethesda seems be be tweaking the numbers after adding Earl's boss battle
---
I've done almost nothing else for four days straight.  right now i have fewer than forty Assaultron Recall cards remaining to be crafted - plus however many my old character still has in inventory. still need to move some things to my new character
---
It feels like I picked it up towards the end of last summer, and haven’t seen it sense.
---
Sometimes it happens if you do neither, it doesn't even have to be at the reset.
---
Last night I bought 3 items, 2 3 star armor and 1 3 star weapon. Now I’m going for a commando/rifleman build, just what I’ve always done in most games, I like the gunplay. Now my memory is a bit shaky as I’m not staring at my inventory Rn but I got a vampire “Tommy gun,” a chameleon trappers arm piece and a raider chest with some dope perks, I don’t remember off the top of my head but I was pretty excited. But the night before I bought one 3 star weapon and got a fuckin pipe pistol lol. It’s all RNG. I wish they’d be a BIT more specific in what you’re buying, I don’t see how a fucking pistol a RANGED weapon to be specific but I mean, some days you get the cake, some days you get the c.....you get the point
---
Lol, or it follows you home and makes it burn when you pee.   Or in this case, hollows out your carcass for its larvae
---
Yeah, I'm worried that us hardcore players who put hours of work into our builds are going to be fucked in the name of making things easier for the casuals who want this game to be easy peasy.
---
Bloodied will still be top tier, but yeah, a lot is changing. This game is becoming a sad, watered down version of what we need 76 to be.
---
I believe we did
---
Idk why they haven’t done a modern adaptation of them tbh. Mutant hounds are cool, but not nearly as fallout-esque
---
Because it hasn't been announced yet, my dude.
---
 Soon™
---
It’s hardly playable with fast internet
---
Yeah, I'm sad because now leveling our lowbie toons will be more difficult.
---
Ok well I just signed on after work and I didn’t see it in the tab like everything else. Does it just go into our inventory?
---
**Idea:** You click the jukebox and a popup opens with a list of possible stations, which you can select. The jukebox would be lockable, so you can prevent others from changing the station if you want to. (but they still can for a bounty!)
---
This is great.
---
I saw the post on twitter and came home and nothing in the atomic shop
---
No, there aren't extra challenges this week.  But it's double weekly score, so about 25,000 score.
---
Fuck no. Downvoted
---
They look like green pitbulls on steroids to me
---
It should be in the atom shop.
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with power leveling, especially for those of us who have leveled up multiple characters and are experimenting with new builds.
---
Whaaaat? It’s so close to the end of S1. Is it not gonna be continuous?
---
I know but it’s not for me
---
I missed at least 2 weeks and am already finished before this weeks double score started. If Bethesda keeps the score system like it is now, as far as how much time is needed to be earn the points, I think it’s at a good place.
---
It just needs to be more enjoyable to complete the challenges
---
I’ll close game down and try again
---
People can still buy...
---
I want to earn it, it’s lost all meaning since I’m way out of the game. I liked the challenge of keeping up, not necessarily the stuff.
---
I’m like Rank 50ish.
---
Oh, I see. Idk man.  Tbh I didn't see it either.
---
Just a suggestion I've had controllers that were fine in other games but had drift or issues in others. Just wanted to be sure you considered all the possibilities.
---
Do you know if there will be some kind of sale for tiers or double tier weekend?
---
I was as well for the same reason, but I’m so cheap when it comes to atoms I’ll wait it out for either a ‘proper’ jukebox is released or it comes back on discount.
---
The next season will most likely start when one wasteland releases. Bethesda said we’d have a couple weeks after each season completes, so probably sometime after the 20th
---
Yeah it’s not here for me. Idk
---
I was so happy I caught the sale. I went ham and bought them all.
---
I doubt it’ll be put on sale just do to any ‘fallout’ (pun intended) from players who already bought tiers. But that information would be nice nonetheless
---
yeah the new fo 1st vault skin for the bench I think it looks great, the responder bundle is nice also since I run multi work areas in my camps.
---
I already have 4600 or so atoms just from 1st and various in game rewards.  I might have to buy $10 worth of atoms all said and done.
---
Okay
---
&gt;- Energy Cell, for energy ammo (cant think of a good name).
---
Battery pack?
---
Sorry man
---
Oh gross why? Why have a break?
---
Get good. This game is already easy enough.
---
i carry it instead of purified water cause it weighs less so i but it if i see it for a cap or two per. nothing more than that though, it's basically free to produce in nuke zones.
---
Yea me too
---
Same here NukaCR.Its good hear from you.its been a while since I've seen you on Y.T
---
My friend and I started playing the game maybe a month ago or so and have been having a blast, just about to hit level 50, and everyone I've run into has been so nice. Lots of people just waving, dropping basic meds and aid items earlier on (feels good to do the same now when we see someone below level 20); even had a higher level dude hang out with us once for maybe 15 mins doing a quest that might've been a bit too high for us and basically carrying us to the end.
---
We were afraid we'd be griefed and attacked regularly by level 200+ players, but it hasn't happened once. In the event we participate in an event with a lot of other players and accidentally friendly fire on them and get a bounty, people still don't even try to kill for the bounty because I guess they understand it's a mistake. Every interaction has been so wholesome.
---
Weird flex. I bet it's not even over-budget. Which in turn is also a weird flex.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Earl and his wendigo spawns. Wendigo teeth yield two acid. 
---
Not the easiest, but you'll get a lot of acid!
---
I think it would be better as a skin for a gun.  The problem would be getting rights for it.
---
Sounds nice
---
Plan on it ending at 12 Noon ET on September 8th.
---
I like to start a new character just for the fun of struggling to 50. One of my favorite things with this fake engine is raiding an enemy base, even more fun with friends. The logging camp in the NW is fun to fight, I’m hoping Daily Ops will match that but it may just be DOOM Eternal lite
---
i appreciate it, not sure how I'd test that though
---
Only classical
---
I'm not saying it's perfect, but they could have a variety of designs/fills you can choose from that require a particular set of comics to construct.  But whatever one you construct uses those comics, and if you scrap it you get them back.  But since it's a 'fixed' design it should be less problematic and use less budget.
---
Done and done. It's in the next update.
---
this same thing happened to me but I was playing the one violent night event.
---
Same here. Limited storage space on my Xbox, so I used to download the game and delete it as I played. 
---
Every time you reinstall, all your photos get deleted as well. Absolutely heartbreaking. I’ll never forget the day 1 photo of me and my friend at wade airport surrounded by an ungodly amount of turrets. 
---
Just wish I could see it again.
---
Probably to reduce player fatigue and give themselves some leeway to consider feedback on how the challenges worked this season. A lot of players seemed to not enjoy the challenges and Bethesda is still have the auto-complete bug.
---
Fortunately future combat rifle skins will be applicable to Fixers. Now we just have to wait for  more combat rifle skins.....
---
I have my tent placed there for this exact reason.
---
Someone from bethesda commented on a post earlier that was showing off the atomic shop stuff. They said it'll be in the shop tomorrow
---
keep in mind there are 500 atoms in the final bundle
---
Snallygasters and Yao gui.
---
Edit : toxic larrys, pylon v13, train yard, most places in the bog
---
There would be an even easier fix: why not EXCLUDE display items from the camp budget?  
---
I get why my display case counts for my camp budget, but having a "perfectly preserved pie" or something should not add on the already low budget (why should we have empty display cases to begin with?)
---
They used the m16 in new vegas. You can use the model of the firearm in a game, but not use the actual name. They could call it the Army Rifle, Service rifle ect.
---
Screaming eagle skin for the handmade is pretty close.  Also 99 percent sure it's not in the store anymore.
---
Honestly this would be an amazing addition to the game. I've been trying to make more modernized houses that include all the necessary work benches, but hate that I have to have an area that looks more like a forgery to make the workbench fit in a little more.
---
Yeah it was completely random. It’s the equivalent of getting batteries from a gas station for Christmas.
---
It's a pain like none other because it's the one thing you cant replace.
---
Sell it in your vendor or drop it at the train station. The UI for the ammo converter is beyond fucked. I gave up after accidentally spending 1300 points on shotgun shells. &gt;.&lt;
---
I mean, they already have a combat rifle.
---
Watch the rocket on the board. And the fuel gage showes the time it moves
---
Yeah true actually. Lots of problems.
---
There are some world objects that inexplicably break VATS, like the log pile by Survey Camp Alpha(seriously: go there and watch VATS refuse to function at all if you're near that thing). VATS also relies on your camera for line of sight confirmation, so if you're using it in third person and somebody or something gets too close behind you you'll get kicked out of VATS.
---
-Health rubberbanding. By far the worst bug and the reason i left the game a year ago. Came back to the same bug haunting me. Its enraging.
---
-Events failing upon arriving. I just came here, how can this even happen?? 
---
-Camp items floating and looking horrible. 
---
-VATS hits and crits not doing any damage
---
-Stealth multiplier going from working to not working randomly.
---
-Enemies attacking your camp being under the foundation and being unhitable until stuff breaks. 
---
-Workshop enemies not spawing and rounds not completing. 
---
-And the fucking framerate drops across the board. Cook meat, framedrop. Stash items, framedrop. Its crazy how bad Fo76 runs on PS4. Some items like Nuke Codes freeze the game for several seconds. Everything feels so clunky and laggy.
---
it's under floor decor of all places in your camp build. where they store the plushies as if any monster would put their plushie on the floor!
---
Man they just Keep on saying shit then having to back track. Thanks
---
I expect Bethesda to start doing better. I refuse to buy 1st until they improve the quality and finish of the game, and 1st would be a life-changer for me.
---
Well, what I did was
---
1. On Bethesda, unlink my steam account. (keep in mind by doing this, you will lose any atoms you got through steam. If you only played on the Bethesda launcher, you'll be OK.
---
2. Launched using Bethesda launcher to verify my characters were still there.
---
3. Launched using Steam to confirm that my steam copy did not show my old characters.
---
4. Created a new Bethesda account, using a different email address.
---
5. Link that new account to my Steam account.
---
6. Launch my new mule account using Steam, and my main account using the Bethesda Launcher.
---
I recommend in the future if you have a favorite photo to go into the photo album, remove the hud, and screenshot it through the xbox itself. That way it exists somewhere else.
---
Scrap antifreeze, coolant, abraxo, bloodbug proboscis, bloatfly glands, and makeshift batteries. It’ll start adding up quickly.
---
Yes sir. We haven’t played in ages, and seeing those photos of our good times would be a dream come true. 
---
Unfortunately they’re gone now. All I can do is remember they were once there.
---
never use third, first person only, and this happens everywhere on the map, not just one location unfortunately. next time i play I'll try to figure out xbox recordings so i can document it. it's so frustrating.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. It's the truth.
---
They can make it a skin for the combat rifle but it needs to be chambered in 5.56
---
I have McShitternet and can play just fine until someone shows up with a Tesla.
---
It shows I have the same characters on both accounts.
---
I just wish they’d release the new bug update after the season ends so I have something to do till then. Guess that’s why we’ll have the purveyor sale and another meat week
---
I bought the first nine levels of the last section of the map because I wanted some paint for the T65.   It didn't take me long after that to finish it. Next time I will probably wait until the very end to spend atoms though.
---
Hi! Yeah I had to step away from YouTube because of toxicity in game plus some real life shit going down. But I miss my people! :)
---
At least we have the jukebox now
---
That was a hit or miss before one of the last patches. It either did work or was a delayed explosion. Then after one of the patches, I was told that was patched, but then someone said it might still work? I haven't tested it myself. Got rid of all that I had stored up LOL.
---
I agree 100 percent.  I only unlock it to make the damn green notification go away in the main menu.
---
It ends on Sept 8th which is next Tuesday.
---
Can’t u repair all if u go to ur camp module?
---
Fuck them.
---
owwww
---
A lot of enemies have health that's been rubber banding for some godforsaken reason.
---
Ofc are there a lot of this people, same for almost every other aspect the community want to be added. 
---
Did you read my comment? I pointed out that it isn't necessary or urgent at all, nor did someone has a bad time missing this features. Do you want me to tell this should have a higher priority then bugfixing or adding content for everyone? The dev team is only a shadow of itself, we see the game getting worse each update and then there are people who don't care at all except their minor and literally useless ideas.
---
Bwahahahahaha
---
Makes sense.I hope all works out for the better.lore's video's have been insane the last few days.👍
---
Yes. I hate how non PA users can just spam V.A.T.S., and I also hate that they added the jetpack to non PA users. Seriously? It’s only downside for PA is that it took up a valuable mod slot, and drained the fusion cores. For normal armor it only drains ap which just refreshes in a second and there’s not really any good mods you’re missing out on. It should take 1 flamer fuel per second it’s in the air for non PA jetpacks
---
Because they're still having to draw items and that impacts rendering.  Making it a 'single item' with one skin created for it instead of 20 unique items that have to be rendered separately would likely improve performance.
---
Just build a garage area. It would be normal for a house to have a garage and you can just stuff all the ugly but useful things in there
---
I feel it it fit the motiff of "this world is completely fucked"   and of course it's 2020 and we have murder hornets afterall...
---
Sorry I mean I am at 100, How do I know I am done ? It's not obvious to me at least
---
Just now I fast traveled to scorched earth and people don't know how to launch nukes so I spawned into the nuke zone and got blown up but couldn't pick up my loot because of a glitch, so that was fun.
---
Permanent part of the game. :)
---
It is currently double score on weeklies and all the dailies for the week, you should be fine getting to 100! If you get to 97 you can buy up to 100 and the atoms you get for finishing will pay for it.
---
you're just itching for a fight, aren't you? have a cup of gravy and calm down.
---
This is pretty shitty on Bethesda's part.  Simply by looking at the numbers and doing the math any idiot could see that you have been short changed.   And it's clearly their fault.  And they won't help?  Wow.
---
I'd buy that with a quickness.
---
Steam.
---
I have refund the game already.
---
Haha yeah he's been pumping out some interesting content lately.
---
Excellent!!
---
:D funny enough, 76 made me find other fallout friends, and few new fallout lovers. I havent had any friends who liked and played fallout games
---
The rubberbanding/damage bug.
---
Granted it seems to happen a little less now. But it still happens every now and then.
---
Lag here and there I can deal with, the damage bug straight up halts your progress and forces you to server hop.
---
I mean I'd like pieces that let us snap appliances to walls
---
Shit got me laughing way too hard. 🤣😂🤣
---
See if you can claim the final bundle by clicking it.
---
Yes you need one account per system. You can't use one account on two systems simultaneously.
---
I'd like a mosquito or tick companion, who drains my health when we start our adventure, but if I'm hurt, blows it back into me, restoring said lost health. His name shall be Bloodbank.
---
Can’t teach stupid, I guess.
---
nice. tonight it is.
---
Yeah, I hate that.
---
Check the roof above it?
---
Yeah it could have finished a little better. If you are at 100 though, you are done.
---
Stay in the center and circle as early move don't die most events now.
---
Thanks.  Guess I need to decide if it's worth it having a dedicated mule account.
---
Alright thanks, I guess I was expecting the challenges to end and it to be more obvious I am done. So you can still acquire score even though I am done ..
---
K, i am using a hacked 50 cal now 👍
---
Alright thanks, I agree.
---
I am aware, but you don't show on the map, so it stops you from pissing people off when they spend caps to visit the vendors you are advertising as open to the whole server :-)
---
They're around. I had one that sounded 12 asking me to mod weapons on PC today.
---
His parents seemed to do a good job. Lol.
---
Yesss
---
Well there's an armor ace PA display but the mannequins have atx pictures already , they seem to be different items
---
You still get the message that you have earned score but it is meaningless.  Kind of nice not to grind dailies fir a while.
---
I play enough that the tent and stash box is enough but I agree that shop items could be better.
---
Man, put on power armor and you're basically unkillable in there unless you run at the drill.  This thing is easier than Encryptid.
---
It will follow the game clock, like every other event, challenge, etc.
---
When did they say it was going to be in the Atomic Shop today?
---
Look who is adding comments on mine asking something and has no better answer then this.
---
There are two better options for you: either you accept my viewpoint and argue with reasonable words, or you just ignore me and live on.
---
Either way, saying I want a fight when claiming this topic is not really relevant is lame.
---
Yeah, I really wish you could specify rifle, pistol, heavy, etc. Maybe all with different price points. The pool of “ranged” weapons is huge!
---
Yeah, I watch my partner play XIV on the PS4 and the lack of unused screen real-estate hurts. Especially watching her tanking with so little peripheral vision.
---
Cool nobody asked
---
For one go read their Twitter post and for 2 I’m reporting you because you seem to always follow my posts and start stuff
---
Mama Purveyor has some Furious knuckles for you!
---
Im donating all cloth as well. This is one of the few i dont want to see missed.
---
Good luck, figuring out glitches in this game is a nightmare.
---
I’m pretty causal so I’m not exactly sure what the game clock is which is kinda why I asked if anyone had an exact time
---
You dont need a second pc if yours has decent specs.
---
Just launch a new .exe session, after you start a instance via the launcher.
---
How is asking you a question ‘starting stuff’?  
---
And I didn’t even recognize your name until you said that. 
---
Sorry, but you’re not someone I ‘follow’.
---
**Edit:** Last time I interacted with you was when I tried to ***help you*** about the Technical Data issue you were having. And even then you thought I was ‘starting stuff’. 
---
You’ve got a massive chip on your shoulder, bud.  Two interactions over a seven day period isn’t ’following you’. 
---
Other than the TD post, I can’t recall when I ever replied to you prior to today.
---
The Twitter post from 8 hours ago says ‘later today’. Today isn’t over.  So your point will be valid tomorrow. ;)
---
Not sure what is causing you stress in your life to make you this touchy, but I sincerely hope it gets better for you soon, kid.
---
BE 2* lever for 720 caps. I was a new player and sold it for 12k I was fool. Still happy to have a lot of caps at that level.
---
 Only classical Sucks ! :(
---
Do campfire takes, tag all the bloodbugs, collect Proboscis and scrap
---
Play with others!   
---
or: grab those schwifty 3\* from Earle that you always wanted  
---
or how about: building a nice camp  
---
and then: build a trader emporium (works well with a nice camp and some nice legendaries)  
---
maybe try to get into contact with some traders (OUTSIDE of the game) and get some legacy weapons or rare stuff.
---
Yeah ok, I thought the black rider was a paint
---
Look at the clock on the challenges screen. That's the game clock; that's when everything determined by the game clock resets and a new day starts.
---
Name checks out.
---
Why take chances. But what you need on the 7th. It’s a $1.50 per rank.
---
True but the cat thing was wierd. I habe a hard time imagining a world were all "domestic" and eild cats were killed off
---
Yeah, tried that, no luck finding it.
---
what next?
---
next you decide if youre going to roll the dice they stay magic forever and build around them or sell them..
---
not sure what other choices there are
---
In my experience, yes. Having a mule account frees up my stash space, allows me to hold more items and trade more frequently.
---
Junk Shield is bad.  Stash your junk as often as possible, don't carry it around.  When you die this is the only thing you lose.
---
Serendipity is good, especially for low health builds and no cooldown.
---
Lone Wanderer, if you are referring to the npc teammates in the Wastelanders quest then it will work but only if you are not on any type of team, including solo on a public team.
---
Oh ive been here. I killed the sheepsquatch at level 17 with cheese. I brought my camp there and built a bunch of turrets, then just waited while shooting it occasionally.
---
Yeah, that's a great idea, and could make collecting even a bit more fun: once you possess all the Grognak comics, for instance, it would unlock a special themed rack or wall-mounted case that shows off that complete set.
---
Yea but its still gonna be p bad
---
I just do it to reduce weight
---
Thanks that actually very useful for the run and for everything else
---
Hmm, try carefully blueprinting everything in it one piece at a time, since you cant select the clock maybe thattll save the aggravation of having to redo all of it ?
---
Im not sure if its a known bug or not but I often do not get notified either anymore of an event starting. Making matters worse I can look on map, see a huge mass of peopel but no active event icon. I fast travel there and the event starts but I never saw it as active. Definitely some bugs.
---
Fuck no.
---
It doesn't need a damage buff per se. Legitimate teslas (not the NW ones) can be tanked. My biggest issue with them is how their visual effects fucks over the FPS in events like ACP and Radiation Rumble. 
---
It is a handy weapon in PvE events when you want to tag large groups of enemies without wiping them out so everyone gets the opportunity at getting the exp from the enemies. 
---
In PvP, it's a fucking hilarious weapon to use, but I know why people hate it being used. Honestly if you encounter a legitimate tesla in PvP, you have to adapt and learn how to tank it.
---
weight reduction yo.. in stash and carrying
---
Why did I never think of that in the first place! Thanks for the idea :)
---
Yes i hate that part of the armor bench so much. Thats why it lives outside.
---
If you go to the weekly challenges, and look at the timer, that is the exact remaining time left in the legendary run. Because this is the last week.
---
Giving the fact that SCORE gave us about 75% less atoms than you could get in a week before, it sure sounds like something that should be illegal.
---
Nice, I'm imaging it's heading towards to a nearby lamp though
---
I believe they should nerf nocturnal it’s way too OP
---
If youre bored move on. Dont force it. The same happened to me and im currently looking for another game to get into. Not much looks good right now though.
---
In 8hrs when I ditch this fucking popsicle stand I call my job I'll be joining the winners circle too. 
---
I didn't mind it. I think because I didn't care that I never felt the grind pressure. Sure as hell won't even bother with Season 2.
---
What effects does a magic weapon need? I need a list of magic weapons please.
---
raw resources weigh a LOT less then the normal junk items.
---
So I do like the FO1st workbench skin, but who is going to sign up to get that? If it was a whole bundle with all crafting stations (+ Fermentor!) in that style it would probably get more people moving to get a month of FO1st..
---
Na m8 high capacity
---
I'm a little upsetti spaghetti at how the new patch will affect weapons and damage, but in the end, we have to adapt.
---
Same exact design. It's meant for female characters.
---
Your crazy man you don’t see how weak the weapon is are you new to the game?
---
You could apply this to many in-game mechanics.  Other than f76 facebook groups, this has probably been the biggest hotbed of misinformation for the game
---
Energy ammo mod: Residual Battery
---
Just put your junk away, take off all armor, walk up to another player (preferably over lvl 100) and wave. They should get the hint and do the rest.
---
You get more exp from being one of the last survivors in the round than from how many players you kill. Fucked up but eh.
---
It used to be vault 94 raids. May they RIP
---
Mine either and it’s great. I just clipped a radio into the jukebox and problem solved.
---
One gun army if your using ffr heavies is really good too
---
Thats a good idea, thanks.
---
It wasn't that it was really a grind, but it reminds me of the nonsense of the "free to play" phone games that forces you to play daily.
---
I want to play on my own terms, and online games just aren't that way.
---
They didn't force me to do it, but I agree with you that I probably won't bother with another thing like this from this game. The rewards were mediocre and it sucked the joy of exploring out of the game.
---
*Bungalow walls have been broken for months.*
---
Ive told Beth. Loads of times. They've responded. Still not fixed. Furniture just sinks into it. Your clocks there dude, buried in the wall.
---
They fucked the only prefab I truly loved several patches ago. Walls used to be solid.
---
The brotherhood might gun you down as soon as they arrive next patch.
---
But other than that, no huge issues. Carnivore and herbivore obviously don't work well together.
---
Yeah, something like that.. just mostly looking for more efficient camp budget processes.
---
Oh honey, either add me ign MrsNekrosias or ign Nekrosias if you want to see how not new to the game we are. 😂 He will only use Teslas upon request.
---
Quick everyone buy it and demand a refund because it only plays classical maybe they'll get the memo.....
---
Who ever heard of classical in a jukebox anyway? a gramophone is where that should be. It would probably more appealing and sell better.
---
I remember it being mentioned that there will be a week or two in between seasons. so don't expect it to start immediately when S1 finishes. That is what I read somewhere, at least.
---
The NW ones aren't that good tbh, it's better than the semi-auto but worse than a normal auto
---
Been like this for a while, man hunt you travel there and the event is active but not in your pip boy few events are like this.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs) i think this guy explain it rlly well :)
---
I would decimate you and your entire clan just myself
---
The NW one with 500+ damage isn't good?? Like...even I can't tank that.
---
Best troll post I've ever seen, seriously. 😂🤣😂
---
The NW one has slightly more damage than a lvl 50 non-legendary semi auto tesla. Doesn't really count if it's a hacked weapon
---
Heavy weapons drain more AP than other weapons. That's why your minigun is draining so fast. I have no idea why it's like this, maybe heavy weapons are supposed to be hard to aim or something.
---
Not a troll dead serious man il send u my email to Bethesda if u want
---
Yeah, it's ironic they fixed bungalow windows but not walls. I actually liked walking through my bungalow windows as it saved me time going through the door, lol.
---
Ofcourse, I agree. But creating builds around things that shouldnt be there? Uh...
---
Its a very solid weapon, decent ammo cost. Scatter barrel turns it into a rapid fire shotgun basically, tho it does break quickly
---
I've got 3 left. I stopped levelling everyday and it looks like the weeklies reward more, 2 to 3k score rather than 1 to 2. Not sure it they changed it at some point or if it got higher to compensate for the higher score required since the dailies stayed the same, 250 to 500. Maybe it adjusts the weeklies because people would more time to do that than grind every day so the dailies are there for extra. I'm not sure though. 
---
But I had the plan to buy the last few from early on since I missed the first 2 and a half weeks but I'm 3 away from finishing and should be able to get it in the next few days and I haven't had to buy any yet. But that's considering I grinded the dailys and even levelled up almost every day just to make up for what I missed and I'm also starting uni soon so I may have to skip some days and buy the end of the next run since I can't grind every day.
---
I just missed the recent level ups since I'm close and so tired of grinding it. Got easy during meat week, lots of events with waves of high level anemones and lots of populated servers and events for hours. Same when a colossal problem dropped, lots of nuked and boss farming. But after that rush it slowed down a lot and I join dead servers, barely any events and no one participates, sometimes no public teams, not even building. Levelling up again just got slow and isn't worth it without something to do
---
Does she broadcast from KMAX?? 
---
I've went over there before and it's still boarded and blocked off.
---
honestly right now Im just trying to recover from legendarry run with a MEAT Week in the middle of it..
---
its been like a month since Ive been able to just casually grind out my regular routine 
---
its really nice to be able to play the game without worrying about.. kill this kill that team up and kill these build those take a picture level up collect 20 scrap guns mod armor rinse repeat...
---
I don't want to think about this, especially not about the reputation grind.
---
They didn't have to give out any at all. A lot of games with premium shops don't at all or only give a minor taste at the beginning.
---
That would be a good spot to put her.
---
Hehe we have very similar shops. I've been thinking of going back to brewing and selling hefe and bock drinks again.
---
1 vendor full plans
---
2 vendor legendary guns armour and ammo
---
1 misc clothes and rare gear
---
Why you wanna buff it? Seriously. You on PC or Console? Just curious.
---
I was planning on grabbing the chemist mod, but I found someone selling high cap for 5K in their vendor and I decided the 3 points in strength weren't worth more than the 60 extra pounds in my Chinese stealth armor. Of course, the third option would be to stop hoarding chems, but look I might need those hundreds of bufftats and psychotats some day you just never know.
---
If that's the case you need a BE15rl single shot. That is what you are in search of. I one shot almost everything, with no pistol perks.
---
Yeah, I was kind of wondering if a guy could sport it. Like Piper's trenchcoat for example
---
Ya, even if you just talk to her through an open window or something.  It would be a cool little thing to add in a future update
---
Thank you, you just saved me 500 atoms to waste on another worthless item...
---
When and where? Ign Nekrosias, mind if I record?
---
It’s damage is atrocious and range is dreadful and why does it Matter what I play on
---
Given electricity would earth when fired at the ground it really shouldn't arc like that at all.
---
(Yeah yeah I know, Fallout Magic Science!)
---
Not to poke holes in your plan, but how are you gonna reach the players that dont cruise reddit / the fo76 subreddit?
---
Im thinking a good majority of people that frequent this sub, know not to use a tesla currently because of the lag... but not everyone reddits.
---
Shit my Bad Community
---
Idk if I want to decimate you and embarrass you and show off your petty soul
---
Fridges, Rain catches, all atom stuff...
---
But cynasim aside.  There are supposedly legendary perks to grind out that will generate ab item to quench hunger and thirst.
---
I normal go Huntersville, this place, Ripper Alley, Rosalynn's Memorial, West Tek, Isolated Radio Array in one run without fast travelling. This and Abandoned Bog Town are my favourite xp grinds. Murants give way more xp than ghouls.
---
True, tbh I have no idea I was just putting it out there in the hopes that people who do use this subreddit and eventually it’ll expand to a vast majority of players who either read here or know someone who reads here
---
What shouldn't be there? magic weapons?
---
Lol they can get these hands..
---
1)remove from friend list
---
2)change servers
---
3)block for session
---
Happens about 1 out of 10 times I'm being nice and helping a new player that they latch on like a peach to my sack.
---
Because if you was PC then I'm sure someone could buff it for you 😂. The damage seems fine on xbox, and if it doesn't work then the JE laser does the trick lol
---
Yeah fuck the rep grind. I've only done that on one toon.
---
True, there arent other choices. Stay alive, and be able to protect myself (like with takin workshop - too many times i was just wiped out from planet with one shot). Or choose harder way to play. Pray or predator. Blue pill or red pill.
---
I learned to never try and intentionally make walls with the foundations, due to how you can weirdly walk up them like they have invisible ramps
---
Their hitboxes are fucked up everywhere except literally on top of them 
---
Sucks because they're the nicest looking "concrete walls" in-game rn
---
The only alternative is if you place brick walls inside out, but I don't like doing that because it causes other building issues and sometimes looks weird
---
She isn't in there right now. You can get in the building. But it would be a great spot to put her if they did add anything.
---
I wish we had Grahams bbq music 🎶
---
It's just a bed with hearts tho, in all fairness
---
I know, but in comparison to other Teslas, the damage is insane.
---
Just give me a time and place, I'm free all night bby &lt;3
---
How do you get in? PA glitch?
---
At level 20, the bulk of the Wastelanders quests will unlock for you.  Hit 20 then make sure you catch up with the Overseer.  Until the One Wasteland update drops later this month, steer clear of the Savage Divide, Mire, and Cranberry Bog/Watoga until higher level.
---
u/Nekrosias apparently this guy has no idea who we are.
---
This is why I stay in my camp at night, doors locked. Nocturnal crazy OP right now, stat safe. Best to take those guys out during the day with a team of crackhead commandos.
---
Same. I'll occassionally go craft some low level basic stuff if I see a lowbie around. Then go figure out where they are going, get ahead of em, and leave it in an obvious container and just wait in stealth.
---
They think they just got lucky, not handed stuff. Secret santa mode basically
---
Are you on pc?
---
Come join me I’m level 14 trying to get to 20 to finish the overseer quest line.
---
Sounds like you need to take a look through your junk tab to find some unscrapped junk, then marvel at how much weight you've opened up. 
---
A scrap assaultron head is 8 units of weight, those tube flanges are like 3 units, that unscrapped junk will put a hurt on your 800 unit weight limit fast.
---
Rock on
---
I really like the iron sights on it. Whole new gun with the familiar feel of the handmade.
---
That’s what it felt like when I first started. Had to get creative on how to do a lot of running and hiding just to kill characters. Once you’re over level 30 you’ll start seeing better weapons.
---
I finished it last week without grinding. I bought the last 2 ranks out of pure laziness. I didn't think the run was difficult overall. I mostly played the way I already did, with a few forced challenges.
---
My main gripes are with the lag on the run screen and glitches with certain rewards. Good god. I don't get lag anywhere near that bad anywhere else in the game, including queen fights.
---
Yeah, however I never said anything about making builds around making magic weapons.
---
I'd like the option to disable confirmation prompts in general. My E key begs for mercy any time I get home from a trip to Lucky Mine and spend the next few minutes mashing to smelt my hundreds of lead ores, and then again to craft a few thousand rounds of all the ammo types I use. Please, give me a menu option to enable/disable confirmation prompts so I can turn them off during that whole process and then turn them back on afterwards so I don't accidentally drop something that will get destroyed.
---
Saw a 1437 at meat week. I couldnt tell if I should be impressed, suspicious,  or scared.
---
The key is on top of the trailer out back.
---
The warehouse walls look pretty similar to the ones you want imo, just a bit more green in color
---
Some skins for the warehouse walls would probably be ezpz, just probably not much interest perceived there
---
Your pve af
---
I scrap my junk because it makes me moist
---
When fusion core and plasma core had a baby, the lord Atom proclaimed it the nuclear core.
---
Yeah it de drove me insane. Modded it away just to not hear it at other people's camps
---
And...Project Paradise - plenty of Yao Guai, Snallygasters, bloodbugs, and crickets there.
---
Does this happen in a particular location in his cavern or can it happen anywhere?
---
Son of a.......
---
I have nearly 1300 hors in and never knew that!! Going to check it out!! 👍👍
---
I hated grinding on the stupid thing just to get to the end. But I couldn’t stop playing because I didn’t want that bastard to beat me to the end.
---
Offer is on the table, stop hiding beneath it you troll.
---
Does he have grinders
---
Following the main quest line, build a cool camp, go find some Raider PA, it unlocks at 15, this will help a lot even with high level enemies. Do some dailies and weekly challenges to unlock a few rewards. Try understand the perk system, you want to make sure your build is in line with what you want to do, Melee vs gunner vs sniper etc .. start working towards getting a strong build. 
---
Unlock POI's, do events ..  not all of them should be level 50's, if you stay to the middle and left of the map, it should be all enemies you can handle. If you struggling, get a hammer, it will make all the difference.
---
I was just reffering to adaptation. Why we should adapt to things that shouldnt be there? Just loose thought. And probably they will be removed? (i hope so)
---
The first sign of realizing you were going to get decimated and now looking for a way out.
---
Gutted as it was the centrepiece of my camp from the second I started the game. Then one day I couldn't mount jack shit to it.
---
Beth knows. It's their 'collision mechanic'. They just don't care to fix it. It'll still be sold however....
---
I'll take my hundreds of lost perk points over the chance of losing all my progress, just look at the simple bugs that have never been fixed and the daily completion that only affects some people. When the perks go live there's going to be enough backlash over how lackluster they are without throwing in thousands of accounts reset to level 1.
---
Hey, if someone already cleared out West-Tek before you got there, just go to Grafton Steel instead. That's an option now, and lots of others.
---
It gets posted in some way or other, almost every day since ACP launched on PC.
---
But than again maybe less know than I think.
---
Oh I meant adapt to whatever the new meta is after the patch.
---
I really don’t want to embarrass you man especially on camera
---
Glad to help. 😁
---
I stumbled on it by luck. My camp is a little south of there so I was just running around exploring all the locations in the area.
---
stay in the forest for awhile unlocking locations and doing events/side missions..
---
then go to the toxic valley and do events, side missions and unlock locations
---
then go to the ash heap and repeat the process..
---
constantly upgrade your gear to whatever you can get thats got better stats than what youre using
---
when you hit lvl 50 and start getting some mediocre legendary gear(likely a few levels before that) you can start banging out quests, events, side missions in the savage divide and eastward...
---
all of this information is useless once 1wastland shits on us..
---
The scaling is going to be awesome, as well as the fact that enemies will now frequently drop ammo based on your weapon.
---
*you're, also add me any time. Ign Nekrosias. Go claim a workshop, make a little office we can talk in, then I'mma take your workshop then call you to my new office. Bring your parents too they need to sign a permission slip for ass whooping session #2
---
Fiiiinaaaaaaaaaaaaaally, someone asks about the rabbits.
---
When I was low level, I got chased by a glowing crowned high level deathclaw. I ran from it..into a glowing sheepsquatch. I went and hid and let that fight happen...
---
Deathclaw barely won. I finished it with 5 nades. I made me smile
---
Correcting someones text wont remove the 50 extra pounds on your belly.
---
They haven’t announced anything so your guess is as good as anyone else’s.
---
But theyre on the list.
---
Between that skin, and the fact that the armco machine makes 5.56 faster than I can use it when just doing dailies and stuff, I stashed my fixer and have been using my handmade for like 2 months now.  Does a little bit less damage, but I can shoot more and haven't crafted ammo for it since.
---
I figured maybe she was just locked inside for protection or something. Love finding stuff like this!! Thanks again!
---
It causes problems on PC, too? I guess I've been lucky not to encounter anyone using it.
---
Tangawa Town, kill all the crickets. Them toxic larrys and kill all snallygasters. Server hop
---
You all saved me 500 atoms. 
---
Would any of you recommend the contemporary bundle?  It's quite expensive but I have 3000 atoms due to all the challenges I have done.
---
Well, you can wear it, but its a bit on the feminin side. https://i.imgur.com/BdO3x1r.jpg
---
This. Add “The Deep” as well, few crockets in there.
---
I've got two accounts and F1st. Run both accounts on one PC when I need to move things around or trade. I have a beefy system but I wouldn't play with two accounts. It's just convenience.
---
Nor will shittalking on reddit, but here you are tryin
---
*you're 
---
Also look me up on youtube, dude. I'm not uploading new shit but I have enough old content to prove you otherwise.
---
Catched it! :) its my fault to making this missunderstanding, sry dude.
---
I’m in the same boat. I only got into the game two weeks ago, but I planned on grinding as far as I could and buying out the last of the season. 
---
This is one of the rare situations where neither side even remotely won.
---
When this game is good it's great
---
Trying*
---
You're the one that started it mate, it's beyond me 
---
trying*
---
With lower level players getting old voice overs and level 100 and up getting choice new comedy material , like I heard you just got powned last night..... by your mother.
---
Nice, oh and cant remember the name,  where the overseer got mauled at a bed and breakfast place 2 yao guai spawn.
---
If they do I hope there’s a way to kill her. She’s just so damn annoying... I wish I could just go back to just the music
---
Where is the radio station?? I don’t know if I have ever been there!
---
I don't recall inviting you, don't comment on my stuff without permission, "raider"
---
Change your user flair to Brotherhood, you traitor. Raider my ass.
---
The very south end of the Mire. Just off the main road.
---
It's all good. :)
---
Ive seen a couple posts from PC users that were affected.
---
I am a console player and luckily havent experienced it yet that I know of.
---
From what Ive read, maybe the auto tesla is more to blame than the semi, but its basically all anecdotal evidence, so tough to say for sure.
---
Power user doesnt affect plasma cores aswell if you werent already aware
---
You gonna fight me or no bro? Or is all you got is reddit flair?
---
You done played yourself mate I didn't say "50 pounds on YOU ARE belly" Your and You're are two different words...
---
If you do all the challenges this week you can get to level 75-ish.
---
I'm not talking to you, dumbass. Was responding to u/Rowan_The_Boat72
---
Tesla boys downvoting because they are a bunch of ignorant bastards
---
Whatever radio station has the fans on the first floor in cubicles can also spawn a squatch. Went in for fans, entered in middle of throw down with the scorched.
---
I hope not. If so, any weekly challenges you do now will be completed before the next the season starts. I doubt they would carry over or restart the week halfway through, so we'll either need to be careful to not get any weeklies over the next few days, not play at all, or hope it starts next Tuesday at the earliest.
---
They are the right hand of God in PVP. 1200+ damage per second makes it quick work. I love it when people are being jerks and spamming quantum's and you just melt them into a green goo LOL
---
Let me look into my crystal ball....
---
Not soon...
---
The ideas are there the execution is a different story
---
Wow. I don’t know if I have ever been down there. Will have to try and check out later.
---
idk how you could possibly lose your progress or reset your character to lvl 1, every lvl 50+ character has exactly 49 SPECIAL points to distribute plus the base 7.
---
On the 7th, I think.
---
Goode idea but I dont think time gated rewards would be fair. I rather have any and all events give me something that is currently available AND something that existed in the game. Something useful, meaning, ALLevent should give 3-5+ Treasure Notes, 100-200+caps, 10+ scrips, ANY and ALL plans that ever existed in the game (although perhaps a small chance). So someone who started playing can still play and play and play and on the paper, can get anything someone whom already played some past  events, seasons etc.
---
I stopped doing many events and dailies cuz they give NOTHING useful, especially Notes..., let alone something i havent had. Some crappy 1 or 2 star legendary weapons or armors, the plans i already have. thats it.
---
I might have had thousands of legendaries, but legit less than 10 was WOW this is useful for me, or someone who would like these legendary attributes.
---
Free upgrade? Hahaha
---
Not only at ACP but everywhere. To use a Tesla in a current state of the game just shows how dumb and ignorant some people are.
---
Lol like this is your thread? I assume you think what you see is what you own, Okay 40 year old neckbeard
---
Why do you think?
---
To have a counter is a luxury. I have this glitch that prevents me from respawning locally after death. If I die once in Colossus it's game over. I'd like this ability.
---
It's what I heard on other posts here
---
I mean believe when ya want, at the end of the day, IGN Nekrosias, these hands are rated E for everyone. if you keep acting up I'll give you a bedtime too
---
My guess would be when the One Wasteland update comes out.
---
Haha, I have heard they are quite strong for pvp.
---
Great at endgame pvp, terrible at endgame pve sounds balanced though?
---
Ballistic weps are better for endgame pve and from what I have heard generally aren't as good in pvp.
---
Does that sound accurate?
---
Ya, I never knew you could get inside. On my to do list for later!
---
Added second picture
---
Stop using it. It lags out everyone else too
---
At gamescom they said that at launch PS5 and XBOX X will run Elder Scrolls Online (and I think they also said Fallout 76) in backwards compatibility mode.
---
They work on a native update but this will launch sometime later in 2021 as far as I understood.
---
What this mode does exactly does on each console would be interesting.
---
Nope. The trend has been being able to get the radio personalities killed. Might be problematic to implement.
---
Using my magic mini and lmgs, is amazing at everything except earle and the queen, i can solo earle but it takes 20min.
---
They can down vote me all they want. Doesn’t change the fact they have zero free aim.
---
If my maths aren't wrong thanks to this double score all people above level 85 can make it to level 100 without spending atoms because you can get like 51000 score this week with all the challenges. 
---
That's what's good because without the double score only the ones who were at the same level as Zorbo would finish it.
---
You’re right. on my char - water now weighs 0.15, inert flux is 0.2.
---
There's no nerf to Magic weapons coming in the near future.
---
The next major patch is rebalancing damage calculation, which is going to hurt super high power builds like Bloodied and Junkie's a little, but they haven't done anything to fix Magic weapons, since that's an issue with registered hits being multiplied.
---
It might take a long time for them to fix that, since it seems to be a Game Engine issue.
---
They nerfed it with good reason tbh. Thing was op as hell.
---
Theres a reason i dont build near commonly nuked areas.
---
Like people only nuke for earle or the SBQ, occasionally whitesprings. I havent seen a nuke go anywhere else in ages.
---
See, that sounds terrible. I just liked keeping up, I never did everything I just did enough to stay “alive”. But then I moved and missed one week in the actual move and two weeks waiting for internet. A few more weeks to not caring anymore lol basically I just want some fresh content.
---
The game will work as it does today, as will (I believe) every other PS4 title.
---
Fabulous,  have a camp there it rocks
---
Yes, it's probably the best building set out right now. You get a lot of nice things for those atoms too. Very worth it
---
Yeah, she should be a daily quest giver or something. Or have a questline where you help her fix up a radio station then turns into a daily quest.
---
Something to that effect. But yeah i like her too, she's a good DJ.
---
Maybe Bos didn't get enough donations so they just took the rest
---
That’s what I said or at least 50-100 atoms everytime we level up past 100
---
The tinkers work bench is behind the armor shop, just a bit to the right as crossing the bridge to enter crater. Funny story while getting lost.
---
Is the Tesla what’s causing that nonsense? I had no idea but it checks out now that you say it. The walls and other things start to look like they’re pixelated or blurry. The game grinds to a halt. I thought it was just from meat piles.
---
I always run away if I spot an aggressive, I like them too much! Wendigos I also run away from, because I'm a coward.
---

---
If you place it on the roof or the tables or up on the cliff the encounter spawns everything someone visits. 
---
Expensive but glorious. Nothing like getting legendaries from your turrets.
---
Bonus, you can put a fusion generator in the attic.
---
Is it just the tesla that does that?
---
You can mitigate this a bit if you plan around the building a bit.
---
*it* is indestructible
---
I'll beat you with my walker now stay off my lawn, or add Ign Nekrosias, even with these dentures I'll eat that ass
---
Or they just let you throw a one-time switch to reset everything because it’s the right thing to do. Shouldn’t have to grind for that... there are enough things in the game that have that.
---
Energy weapons are bad because only their base damage gets factored into armor penetration, instead of paper damage (pip boy damage).
---
This means that regardless of your damage, the enemy ER is going to reduce your damage significantly more than its supposed to.
---
This can be as high as 75% lost damage without many
---
 buffs at all.
---
It would be nice to have a friendly face in the Mire to talk to. Maybe the radio station could be a place to hang out? Daily defence and repair quests would be cool too
---
FWIW - I am a melee build with rifles as a secondary (13 PER)  
---
I have given 3 points to stabilized, 3 to tank killer, and one point for the STR perk with a picture Of a tank
---
I tend to not use performance enhancing chems or food.
---
Specifically against SB’s:
---
Of all the non-melee weapons I have used, a vampire focused gatling plasma does the most damage per shot, with a focused zealots gatling plasma not too far behind.  Vampire .50 is a distant 3rd.
---
1300 whores is impressive!  Mad props lol.
---
This has always annoyed me. I always try to turn it off and not sure that works. Seems like sometimes it stops and sometimes it doesn't.
---
😂😂
---
I havnt played in months but I just kinda assumed this would have been fixed by now. Then I remembered, Bethesda
---
They're bugged to have armor penetration only affecting base damage. Once this gets fixed, you're right.
---
Also, Teslas will probably outperform legacies
---
What might thos magical weapon be? I feel next to useless whenever im in that event
---
Maybe it's just high level encounters of any kind? Just found this place last night and got Super mutants vs something else (couldn't check, just heard the noise and explosions, the muties won), then my game crashed and upon return it was big ass albino Deathclaw va glowing ants.
---
I can't confirm tbe nuka cola were there which is very nice tho.
---
EDIT nevermind, misread your post sorry, thought you meant it only spawned those two options you listed.
---
Yea thats true I didnt think about that
---
M'lady
---
Hello r/ladydevann just saw your post comments and was hoping to ask you can you add or get someone to add a 9mm Springfield 1911 pistol, m1 garand and a ww2 style 20-30 round straight mag for the.45 smg please i left fallout for service and I was hoping to see it and didn’t understandable of course but I’ve been posting about it on the Reddit with a friend and other people in the fo76 community likes the idea. Ik you need advanced info so maybe if you are seeing this maybe make it a after bos thing..like after they land and stick around for a bit (the winter is fine too) please get back with me on the com check if you can I’d like to see it:) keep going bethsheda wooooooooo
---
"Able to get them killed"
---
As if I didn't do all the killin' myself...
---
Patch 22 hasn't been released yet...
---
OMFG I got the plans today from Phoenix at Watoga. SO strange as I've been after these plans for so long now!
---
Ya i got stuck with plain looks like shit :(
---
May I be your carpet?
---
Don’t change your attack to me. Yet another sign you are running from the original discussion and focusing on someone else.
---
Yes please! Really want the Responder one.
---
Nope. Energy armor penetration is broken on all energy weapons on all platforms.
---
Only affects base damage. This is why Quad tesla is better than B/J tesla
---
Bro for real I would murder for the raider tent
---
That plane is full of fuel and it’s not earth’d
---
Man, the earth in my house is going bad
---
The guy walking on the third rail was fine, until he decided to pee and his stream earth’d him. 
---
Does this device use a common earth?
---
Until the nerf comes through find a piece of armor that has blocking effect.it makes my guass pistol work pretty good in vats but its trash outside of vats or any other way.no pistol perks either
---
We need the ability to have multiple camps to one character that we can choose from. I’d like to build something like this but my trading post is really nice
---
I had a stealth build which makes the questing a lot easier (only engage when i had to), but scaling coming soon so hopefully you can play whatever style you want
---
Interesting. Thanks for giving me some hope.
---
The fact that they trumpeted the announcement of ESO and Doom Eternal onto next gen consoles, but were deadly quiet about Fallout 76 on PS5 speaks volumes.
---
I know, right?  So many places are the new west tek, you can stay on one world now with a maxed out building team and kill so many enemies.
---
Yeah I know, that's why they need to fix it, it's my 2nd favorite weapon
---
It seems like it's hard to fix. It's been around for a while.
---
Your going to cause some Damage...I meant fix some damage
---
How about instead we all just agree to pressure Bethesda to fix the freaking problems with this game that seem to multiply every time they add new things to the game?
---
You need to watch Breaking Bad again man. Especially the episode where a fly gets in to the lab.
---
Tasty Travis Tunes
---
The damage on a NW tesla is lower than a normal one. Its total output is higher but no idea where you're getting a 500+ number from. Base damage for a non-legendary lvl 50 tesla rifle is 78, damage on a NW one is 76. The only other differences on the NW one are an accuracy of 71 instead of 72, a weight of 30 instead of 8, and a fire rate of 44 instead of 20. A non-legendary automatic tesla rifle has a higher DPS than the NW tesla rifle
---
Look up the real walter white. Buckets... I am sticking to it.
---
Yeah, I got a nocturnal pipe pistol, only level 5 the other day, but it one shots the sbq.
---
Are you talking about the fallout 1st tents? I didnt even know those were temporary. I figured they came with the sub.
---
I gave them over 20k in steel for those shitty care packages... Better not of. (I'll admit the stuff inside I did give away) but still.
---
I’m bloodied and I am dying a lot. But that’s because I get tunnel vision with vats.  So many hazards to avoid.  So many wendigo spawn so fast and while you blast Earle a couple get a swipe in.  60 seconds too crazy. 30 seconds is enough of a kick in the dick imo.
---
Cabin at the kiddie cabins place...building by the armor scrap bench where you turn in the goo for the scouts.
---
VPN is not the issue. It doesn't matter where you sign on from. If you cheat your account should be locked regardless of where you login from.
---
Sorry, if I m being surrounded by a heap of wendigoes. To survive, my tesla is a life saver. Period.
---
Yeah. It is ridiculous. How does the game not notice someone literally flying around and shooting non stop?
---
The game got its vengeance. 
---
Got back leg kicked by a sassy later that day. It killed me with the kick and my body ragdolled hard. It was a free range event at southern belle motel. The dude kicked me into the treehouse village 
---
Bonus..it had me discover it...
---
Thankfully the death marker did show where I landed which was where my junk was.
---
This.
---
After completing it I returned to the same habit of logging in every day to realize I had nothing to do. 
---
Literally no rewards left to grind, and I am now realizing how lame the whole scheme is.
---
Oh that would be a fantastic idea. I can see where they’d think the blueprints could work for that. But they’re too limiting
---
I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying about the VPN use, I'm more so referring to those people that are distributing and creating the trainer's and cheating programs that I would highly imagine would be hiding behind a VPN to prevent being easily tracked down, especially those that are making a profit by selling their software or in some cases "burner" accounts.
---
You ain't getting the good ones my dude.
---
Honestly if someone did that to me I would think something fishy was going on and just continue about my business
---
I don't really play anymore, so let me know when it's a good time for you and I can log on. My gt is Sctrojangirl42.
---
Wondering if simplifying the way damage is calculated (like in the PTS) will reduce the chance tl trigger magic effects
---
I would say they could fix it immediately, as they fixed the movement speed glitch tied to the fps after release which was also rooted deeply inside the engine.
---
My guess is they dont care or don't want to fix it on purpose, otherwise they would had removed hacked weapons now for a while. They are still there, no one cares and players don't even hide them.
---
Not really. Killing or shooting a wanted player doesnt break pvp outside you and that player. I have had to do this a few times and always works. I usually will drop something for their "trouble", but not always.
---
Join teams. Fast travel to their camp unlock a few new locations. Start collecting the holotapes at Whitesprings. Goad ghouls from the gold course to camps with turrets then let the turrets finish them off. Of course making sure you have the materials to repair said camp if the ghouls break it as it is a good neighbourly thing to do. Follow the main story quest. Wander and explore. Make sure all junk is safely broken down and stores before you go exploring then dying wont be too much of a bother. Learn to run away when things get to hairy.  Participate in events like Mama Dolce Feed the people and Back on the beat.
---
I want to know how this affects nuclear winter.  If I have higher special stats across more specials, I can equip more high cost cards?
---
Finished on week 3 or 4 ...
---
I don’t have an answer.  I just hope that game developers have reached the conclusion the current game doesn’t have room for growth.   For instance, how do you add new, more powerful weapons when the current weapons are all ready over powered?  I suspect Bethesda is looking forward, at future generations of 76 players, and asking How do we provide an environment they can grow into?
---
I don’t know.  I have no answers.  I just suspect there is a much bigger picture than “How do we keep this group happy?”   Fallout 76 is a business and any business that isn’t growing is failing.  I started playing in December 2018, just after launch.  I will either adapt to the new system or move to another game.  At this point, there just isn’t a game I’d rather be playing.  We will see.
---
I’m glad I don’t grind like you. I would’ve forgot how to play the game if I hadn’t played for two months
---
Free upgrades? Lol. If they even release it for ps5 (I hope not) then only to sell more copies.  We're talking about bethesda, the guys that released skyrim a dozen times now the past 10 years.
---
You think you could get that much score this week? That would be awesome!
---
Tried that twice. I think when people see a lvl 480+ approach them. They probably think I'm setting them up. I got it solved and now 5 lbs lighter.
---
thatll clear up 200 pounds for me! and 3 agility perks!
---
The 2xp was the finisher for me, but I'm trying to bank levels now.
---
Legacies are just as bad tho
---
What UI Gore?  It's literally minimalist like Skyrim.  Just three small bars at the bottom screen and I have quests off.
---
Have you tried this one?
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QE7jKymF-dURn38lNfLnHMkOGYRa1Pi5HWkfD2RQaPs/htmlview#gid=0
---
I never do dailies...well not since the end of the legendary run...they mean nothing now...just get score that goes toward nothing as reward. Probably feels like you're play on a 800x600 resolution monitor with the text blocking off 1/3 of your screen 😆...just insane.
---
They aren't available for you to select under the atomic shop Fallout 1st section? I can pick the basic one, responder, raider, etc.
---
Ok. I did not understand what you were saying before. 
---
Their anti cheat approach should not rely on busting the people distributing programs though. Once one person has the software it can be copied and distributed through new means faster then they can be taken down. They need to detect cheating and permanently ban the accounts of anyone caught using cheat software.
---
Don't use lock and loaded. Use the bandolier perk and it'll reduce your ammo weight by 90%. Also don't use luck of the draw either. Participate in any scorchbeast Queen fight you'll get Advanced repair kits.  I have about 80 now from the SBQ and the legendary run.  The getting plasma is a good gun. It does more damage to the queen than my other heavy weapons, unless they are magic.
---
Legitimate! I was also playing at 1 FPM on Xbox. Colossal problem is a colossal problem.
---
LOL !!!
---
If you take a Tesla to fight Earle... You don't belong there and have no idea how to play 76 at all....
---
I used to have a CAMP built on the cliffside above Huntersville with the edge of the CAMP within range of a lead deposit. I’d often saunter on over to see who was fighting who at the rest stop. Great location also for farming legendaries in Huntersville and WestTek. Always hoped a nuke would spawn a Wendigo Colossus at the rest stop but never had any luck.
---
Oh I agree 100% and I'd like to see them take action or atleast implement something that can prevent it, the same goes for alot of different games too.
---
Yes!!
---
You do not have Legendary Perks equipped in Nuclear Winter.
---
No legacy plasmas will especially a TSE with a beam splitter lol
---
It will be interesting to see what happens.
---
It's the Colossal Problem slide show on Xbox
---
I was always told they were a atom shop item so I’ve never checked in the 1st section tbh but il definitely check it out 2mrw thanks 🙏
---
tru they're so pointless having to repair them after every use.(laser wires) though I have seen the occasional working keypad. "occasional"
---
To answer your question OP, no one knows yet
---
If you consider their aim to be to get you into the atom store as often as they can, rather than provide the best UI/UX they can, it makes sense.
---
I suspect it's also why they past couple Fallout 1st items have been down at the end of special offers, the last atom shop tab to the right, rather than in the Fallout 1st section.  They really want people they know are payers to scroll past all the new offers.
---
I doubt it’ll be free knowing how game companies work but even if it is free I don’t think I’ll play it on ps5 I’ll be fine plying it on PS4 still
---
I think it's conducive to Fallout 76's design principles in general - I'm not sure they're up to the task right now of designing attractive stuff for 1st / Atomic Shop, they skip over so many easy designs that people would go nuts over and make these really obtuse outfits and designs that are only ever 'okay' if anything.   
---
Nothing really stands out.
---
Search Angry Turtle on Youtube
---
I feel like it would need a 200% buff before I would be willing to deal with the projectile lag
---
Was fun being down there for meat week, actually had a camp there for about a week as a high level and hated it, might be worthwhile now
---
Agreed. One would think it would take them less than two years to figure out how to reduce the framerate hit on ash piles. It's not like it's all of a sudden a problem.
---
This is exactly what it is.  They're giving out the least valuable thing they can to get you into the atom shop, then trying to get you in a second time when you change it.
---
I built a tower with missiles and floodlights up top and protected the lead extractor with a couple lasers and a fence. The spawns always come from one direction except on those rare occasions where a noob flees Huntersville with a gang of Super Mutants on their tail.
---
It gave people free stuff that was meant to be paid - Let's be real, that doesn't help the game. That premium content from the atomic shop is and was supporting the continuation of the game and it's development - It needs to be sold, not given away.   
---
I know several people that got all of the atom store content they wanted for free purely thanks to their relentless challenge grinding. Never spent a dime and had thousands left over stocked up.
---
I'm going to find that thief, and murder him!
---
He ain't lyin!
---
What's going on with people's games that this is causing lag? I'm not seeing any energy weapons, goo or Ash piles during my lag spikes, and no problems when I see those things.
---
As some one who just started a new character I'm also looking forward to farming ash heap also when is one wasteland coming to 76
---
Look for bears too, there are often some near the colonel kellly monument, always one in the parking lot for phillipi cemetery , and one by dolly sods campground.
---
I keep hearing there’s gonna be a lvl cap on some enimies tho. Like you’ll never find a lvl 50 rad roach ( don’t quote me idk exactly how it works ) In that instance would it still be top lvl loot??
---
For the love of Atom yes please
---
Lol I absolutely agree w you on this one
---
I use my BE Gatling Plasma that does 600 damage each 7 shots which lags the game and sometimes crashes it
---
The repair all button totally fails if you are missing even one crafting item. Can I just skip that one item? No. All or nothing motherfucker.
---
Jump up onto things AI can't reach you. Shoot them until the turn around to run. As soon as they do, drop down. They will turn around and try again to kill you. Jump back up before they do.
---
Repeat until dead.
---
Point Pleasant should be good to take another look at. 
---
It has a large number of mothman cultists with a chance of dropping handmades and stimpacks, plus a high amount of quality junk from the museum, responder's camp in the church, and the roofs.
---
Thanks everyone. Man wtf. The boxes look so good too! I like how a juke box has to be shut off upon loading in, but the radios gotta be turned on everytime.....not! Seriously though. Nobody in their right mind walks into a place and puts on classical.....Cuz it's not there! If it was it would be a trap to immediately throw that person out!
---
Strangler heart still a suspect?
---
Oh is this a problem on pc too? I've never had the issue and have seen a few teslas. Is my rig better or have I just run into people who have less arcing?
---
Scout masks.. just use bullion n craft them. I got 3 x reclaimed deep mining helmets with me. Guess i m lucky
---
Yes! Anything but the plain one please!!
---
There is a 2 minute window from when the server knows where a nuke will land and when damage is implemented. Do not place me in a server where my amp is an the red area. Done.
---
If it bleeds we can kill it !  Sorry bad predator reference.
---
To be fair, you can never have enough jetpacks! That is like saying you are breathing too much air!
---
I am disappointed about losing nuclear proliferator as it actually seemed cool.  And I think very few of these actual live up to their "legendary" title.  Not game changing, just minor conveniences.  They really could have added content or engaging combat mechanics.  Aside from follow through and taking one for the team seeming ridiculously strong and always helpful, the 10-35% chance on the other cards make them unreliable and gimmicky.
---
And the requirement for armor to be matching seems really dumb.  Like really, just why?  At no point has it ever mattered until now, and it's incredibly grindy to even level up after level 300 to get the points to rank up a card like funky duds, so we want to add another level of grind because your preferred armor isn't the same color!?!
---
🤣😎👍
