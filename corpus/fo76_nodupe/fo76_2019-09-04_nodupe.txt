Well considering I can't get a goddamn daily done without a nuke going off I'd say no.

---
Anything? Announce FO5 NY.

[removed]
---
Yeah, that's why I said I didn't know that. Haha.
---
Also placing a window is a nice trick, will try it if my camp budget allows it.
---
a little mobile version that you can hang from the ceiling would be super fun, especially if he makes the mothman noises as he flies around.
---
I'm at a point now where every time I want to put another magazine on the rack, I have to find some other part of my CAMP to delete.  I just wish we had a slightly higher budget......
---
Deathclaw leather is too tough for the Brotherhood's needs.
---

---
Yao Guai leather is perfect for their battlecoats, it is strong but the few remaining hairs and pus-filled blisters are soft on their skin.
---
Though they project a grizzled, tough appearance, most have sensitive skin.
---
Had this with two .50 caliber MGs.
---
Could someone wall glitch through a cement slab?  Worst case you could always make it so whenever your vendors go max, wall it off with a cement slab somehow lol
---
They could offer one radaway for 98 squares and I'd do it for the bunker and greenhouse.
---
I usually sneak and vats around all my missions. I can hook you guys up with some ammo, a couple bobbleheads and aids to try and prepare you again. I won't be on for about 7 hours tho since I'm at work.
---
Yup
---
The danger doom subjugator mask is a must
---
They put it at the end just to force the player base to grind it out. It is a bad practice and scares me how they are implementing it.
---
If you're trying to only get through it without all too much effort, sneaking with a silenced magic shotgun with grim reaper's sprint makes things a breeze.
---
The legendary effects make the armor great but generally combat armor with BOS mod is good or scout armor with polymer mod. Leather armor is really good against energy damage so if you are fighting a lot of robots it’s helpful.
---
I try to make a habbit of staying under 10k just incase someone visits my vendors. Next you should make an easy way to disconnect the power to your vendors so they dont show up on the map. And finally for extra security you should make sure noonce can access your vendors even if your camps not on the map. Ya never know when someone might stumble across your camp and just go nuts on your vendors.
---
lol
---
I tried the simple logic on them. They don’t get it. But glad At least someone here isn’t daft.
---
Yeah I put all of mine in the seedy shed.  Then tested to see if I could reach through the window.. and yup I could! Lol so i went inside and plastered posters over the windows and that worked
---
Hey mate I'd recommend using enclave scout armor from events and then save up gold for secret service armor or get the Chinese stealth suit from the setterlers if your going stealth and fir power armor use what you find untill you het t65 from the secret service guys
---
Honestly. I just had the fallout 1st to auto renew every month. Besides that no I just logged in to check out the store and noticed. I thought at first it was just a visual bug
---
This is nice to hear. I was gonna take a break when finishing the board
---
You need to be able to queue and play in adventure mode until it’s time to play NW.
---
 I also dumbly had the kill switch inside the shed.... people like to play with that and turn the vendors off so you can’t sell, so I ran that line into my mini house with a kill switch locked up LOL
---
Bloodied wannabee with a really nice set of full unyielding secret service armor (took a while to get that done) and really mediocre weapons (ts aiming handmade and aa/aiming/Critfill Fixer)  
---
I get mostly anything done by sneaking around and sometimes use some cheap TS Ultra 308 Heavy weapon for SBQ or ACP.
---
&gt; I have to say, all these low limits (caps, scrips, gold, stash, camp) are ridiculous in my opinion.
---
At least in the Max Caps limits case, it helps prevent inflation but I ain't no mmo economic expert.
---
I need you to retrace your steps for the last 48 hours.  Every little thing you did in the game.  Write it down.   Email it to me.  I need to replicate this.... for completely professional reasons. Not for personal gain.  Professional reasons.
---
I think Possum Badges can eventually be exchanged for loot at the pioneer scout camp. I've completed the quest already so I don't know if any of it is locked behind the questline or not.
---
Yes. It's much easier with two people than with eight.
---
I stopped putting skins on weapons incase I do the dumb thing and drop them causing them to vanish.
---
Yeah, I haven't found power armor chassies that is my lvl yet. And I haven't specialised in any weapons yet, I don't really think this will be a common thing though and I will probobly swich servers if I meet more people like him again. They are just not woth my time and annoyance if I can't really do anything about it.
---
When its easier to just play the game and make ammo from scrap, you know the Ammo Converter interface is pants and pointless.
---
It would definitely be Free States Eyepatch and Revolutionary Coat... If I hadn't switched from PS4 to PC where I could no longer get the coat bundle :(
---
Haven't received 1st or my atoms, quite pissed off.
---
Did it work?
---
Trouble is, there are SO many if you wanted to display them. I was more commenting on the difficulty in getting the sets completed.
---
I find the ammo converter so annoying that I don''t even use it. Yup, there's free ammo to be had. But I hate enough that I don't care.
---
Not sure, the foosball the greenhouse and the laser game all seem exciting. Someone will make a video the first or second week showing it off and realizing neither are played by you, but just looks like your character is playing it. And that will hurt a bit. I want them to be playable.
---
I'm not too sure as I haven't had that glitch but there are two things I could suggest. It may take a few tries but try using the "photomode" glitch to phase through the door. You can use it to get through any regular door that can be opened/closed. It doesn't work with laser grids though. Another option would be to use the "power armor" glitch to phase through. I'm not going to explain how to do it as it can be considered an exploit but they shouldn't be difficult to find videos on how to do them.
---
Welp guess there is no way to absolutely lock your vendors up lol
---
Store them. No vendor no sale
---
that would take away from fallout 1st sales. There answer to stash is making you pay for it.
---
It’s entirely possible the system was changed or that I remembered incorrectly. I apologize if I came across harshly. I too often see advice that I am *extremely confident* is incorrect, so I probably overreacted.
---
If you refuse rewards you can get more rep each day. Are you doing the photo quest for Davenport because you can turn the pictures in for faction rep also. The raiders also have another daily for rep where you turn in mirelurk meat I think. Any little bit helps.
---
They can potentially charge you for them since you didn't actually buy them. Potentially doesn't mean they will but it isn't worth the risk either.
---
Yes in real life it's designed to be fired from a tripod or bipod, but we are talking about FA76, in which it's a shoulder fired gun.  Yes, there are obviously differences between all the gun in game.  I just can't help myself when I see inaccuracies, even if they are just the exceptions to the rules being brought up.
---
Same haven’t actually played besides going in and collecting my bullion I finished the season 1 weeks ago and just stopped playing after it was done
---
Just imagine being stuck inside a suit for years, and still needing to visit the toilet. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Enjoy that delightful mental image.
---
10 weeks depending on where you read apparently. There is a discussion on this going on in a thread somewhere. Some places say 12 weeks, others say 17th november which puts it at 10 weeks. 
---
Just throwing it out there.
---
You uuhh, you still have that?
---
Because no one wants to play a game that is riddle with hacks. It makes it unplayable.
---
I’ve been able to use vats in pvp and with contested workshops. As always though, 95% chance hits often outright miss far more than 5% of the time.
---
Saw a guy that did that, thankfully managed to glitch inside and buy what I needed.
---
Turn power to them off if you're going to lock them up, if I've spent caps to FT there, I'm buying stuff.
---
Well yah but then you’d have to restock everything once you lower your caps.
---
I do.
---
Economies arent that black and white all the time. I think if we got a small increase like up to 50k yeah some things might inflate but for the most part it would just give people a little more breathing room. I can see weapons and armor going back up but thats not really a bad thing considering they dont sell for much now anyways. Unless you get a crazy roll that is. Ammo would probably stay at a cap for most people. Serums hold their value due to their 500 cap at vendors. Lots of plans would probably get overpriced, but its a new market to play with so hopefully people will figure out that they cant inflate too much or noones guna buy them. We could make it work.
---
What would you want for it?
---
I’d say the greenhouse walls are a basic building tool since we have 5 wall types in this game. Super lame it’s at 99 :(
---
This is why I think it's unlikely they're stuck-stuck, and not more Darth-Vader stuck where they require the respirators to breathe on the surface. They're too sentient to have that kind of a problem imo.
---
A second fleshy basement? Where is that.
---
Atoms make money lol gotta keep the ched rolling in
---
Yeah I guess I’ll just keep using my private world to my advantage
---
I feel this post so much.

Even in an apocalypse, you still get taxed! Fuuuuck.. That’ll be insane if they did that to redistribute caps back into certain locations/Npc lol
---
PvP doesn't work in this game. Level doesn't mean shit. They could fix PvP and griefing but that requires work and they're too busy trying to figure out how to extract money from their player base.
---
I feel you on the friends who stopped playing the game. All but one of my friends who played the game stopped playing before wastelanders.
---
IMO if you're having fun playing the game then that's all that matters. 
---
Do you move your camp around very often? Your wording on loving to build sounds like you you've build multiple highly detailed camps. I haven't moved my camp in forever and I kinda suck at building so it looks rather bland.
---
Does anything special happen this weekend? If not its guna be the same as this past week for you
---
Imagine being this much of a wanker
---
PSA:  Unyielding armor and low health builds super charge xp grinding with +Int.  
---
Even low level super mutants are quick to kill and great xp.  With lunch boxes and 100% xp bonuses plus food.   Stack as much int as possible.   
---
Sell your low level unyielding to new players for cheap.  Huge qol improvement
---
Yh just  equip cannibal quickly and butchers bounty there you have meal simple who needs those fancy recipes anyway
---
Oh you're good, it happens. I think the important thing is to question everything, even yourself. It's not a great thing to do all the time as you'll just lack confidence but being able to consider other points of view can really help you learn. I'm sure I've been in the same situation as you before, so on this post I probably should have initially provided a disclaimer, been clearer, or been more specific.
---
Same.
---
Kinda doubt it since they haven't done shit about, NW hackers on PC, dupers for the last year and a half or eBay sellers.
---
Sorry im on PC.
---
Gods have blessed you
---
Man, is that all I have to do? Maybe I'll take a few weeks off....
---
A bug with Fallout 1st.
---
Yep, you gotta find and learn the plans in order of rank: treated, resistant, protective, and lastly shielded.  You can’t find/learn the best mod (shielded) without first learning the others, unless of course you get it from another player. 
---
The only other exception to this rule is the secret service under armor where you buy the plans for the under armor and can just buy the shielded mod straight away.
---
Just to let you know I was able to place the stored blueprint with several different wall objects. Painting, poster, weapon display, glow in the dark map, lighting fixture, feral ghoul head and neon letters both from signs and letters and the giant letters from the atom shop.
---
If they are lackluster why do you feel like you have to grind to get them all maxed out? That sounds like a wadte of time for something you arent interested in, and that doesnt truly change anything other than master infiltrator (which you only need one rank of anyway). 
---
Also, maybe I missed something in the patch notes, but I'm curious. What aspect of the game is going to REQUIRE you to max out all 6 perk slots?
---
That's my brother's endgame as well, he's routinely at cap limit so he spends time just hopping around and buying things he doesn't have, mostly plans/recipes, from other player's vendors.
---
Hmmm. I was able to place the camp with a door.
---
Mostly looking for bulk junk
---
Quick, buy all the things!
---
The civil war dress makes my character look pregnant. Bleagh
---
Keycard scanner next to door
---
"Edit, do you also get a coin-per-level-after-50 backpay?" 
---
TRANSLATION - "This isn't quite enough free stuff to make the game easier. Is there a chance I can work even less?"
---
Forza has a similar mistake recently. They gave everyone who logged in during a set time 200 super wheel spins. They corrected it pretty quick but everyone who got em, got to keep em.
---
No it doesn't, ill sink 2k 5 mm and get 600 back
---
At no point did I imply or explicitly stated that I wanted to grind for them.  Nor will I.
---
A big part of the problem is they're not tracking information a more experienced team would know to be useful.  It's not just this, it's a lot of things.  If some dev on their team had the experience to say "You know what, some day down the road we might want to know about a character's respecs" they could have been logging that data and used it to credit players the correct amount of perk coins now.  It doesn't even need to be available real time, but there should be a record of it somewhere.
---
Honestly, they could even do it with the information at hand.  They know how many perk cards everyone should have by level, and they know how many perk packs people earned for the season.  It's not a complicated process to credit what's missing.
---
Of course, I think it was putting the cart before the horse to undertake the legendary perk system without overhauling respecs in the first place.
---
Not looking for that ban hammer... lol
---
Alright.im stupid.what the hell are perk coins?
---
Ban you for their shitty code
---
My build sounds like it plays similar to yours. I'll get whacked if I'm not paying attention since I'm running an unyielding set for the carry weight, and my explosives launchers don't normally one-shot things unless they're low-level but they do respectable damage otherwise. As for ammo, why is everyone throwing away all these perfectly good missiles? /s
---
You put 500 hours in the game and it starts to loose that charm real fast. With new content being met with overpowered glitched weapons, The late game being akin to praying for something new. Not saying its not worth it. I just think it only goes so far.
---
I love how nice people are too! I got banned for doing a glitch I didn’t even know was a glitch
---
For the military fatigue mod plans any clue if they are part of a quest or sold by any vendors or are they just a random drop? Sorry Only been playing about 2 weeks still new to how it all works
---
I’m sure it’s a trap, Bethesda is creative...
---
See, but that’s why I want the sale! I figure if I get 20 weapons for my 1000 scrip, there’s a chance I’ll get something better than my usual nocturnal board with slower swing speed.
---
New fallout first feature idea right there give everyone free access to private servers and give 3x caps and stash storage instead.
---
I dont recall ever seeing Ghouls and miners in the same place at once.  
---
In the enclave bunker there is a wall of all the creatures in West Virginia and its grouped by what I can assume is type.Mole Miners are on there as well.
---
Which is why I mentioned *dupemas2020* which was the recent dupe where a significant amount of player took part of.. alot of us were given our accounts back with an *"final warning"* 
---
**PC problems:**
---
Same situation of how GTAO is on pc they don't care
---
**RMT:**
---
Alot of those people are *"smart"* using alt accounts to sell items for real money some of them get nabbed cause they use their main
---
Edit: I also left out an glitch where it involved buying gold from that guy in wayward surprisingly they patched that quick
---
I miss it. Like ughhh. LOL
---
So it looks like it’s a known issue. I’m interested to see what they do. There absolutely will be people that spend all of it. Not everyone is on Reddit.. banning seems really disproportionate for cosmetics vs duped items
---
Yea
---
I never see anyone with tattoos or fancy pants hairstyles.so no. no one cares about tattoos or hairstyles.
---
I only gave 250, since I’m not a huge BoS fan, but I’m glad the community pitched in on this one.
---
If your on xbox I could help out with a proper level set of PA if you want.
---
The deep has a second interloper a smaller one. There is a trap door behind the golf club at whitesprings. It is on the edge of the golf course.
---
lol you're not getting it.
---
Everybody need to just chiiillllllll maaaannnn let’s just see how it is next week and if it does suck then complain all you want heck throw your Xbox in the trash it’s your life. Until then be grateful for the kind gesture. Thanks Bethesda (edit: spelling)
---
Thats nice of you but I am a PC player.
---
It’s their money, don’t f**k with their money. I did not bring this upon myself, and I have a ticket in, so hopefully all is well.
---
Is the non explosive +33 vats by any chance? It’s currently a bit buggy so it does extra damage with shotguns
---
I havent noticed, but there used to be a bunch that spawned right at the doorway of the Ash Heap side of Big Bend Tunnel.
---
Then you and anyone that plays can never discuss what they want in the game or what don't like. Now piss off you little shit.
---
The explanation I got kinda makes sense. If you have another legendary of the same gun favorited it will remove one or switch them. It happens to me every login and it’s followed that general rule so far.
---
buy the atom shop itself
---
Huh personally I wouldn't spend them if i were you cause who knows what will happen.
---
Wow, cute... Steam ate my subscription money and didn’t give me my subscription. Bethesda support deferred me to Steam, said it’s a problem on their end. :-)
---
I have done it. Right as a guy was walking up to buy stuff. Takes too long changing walls or moving things about. Had to either remove quick or drop from server.
---
Season 2, done
---
Yes this is exactly how it is for me. Say if I have two mini guns in a bloodied and a junkies. Some times not all the time one will be removed or switched to my Gatling gun instead
---
Good luck on the next adventure then, and hopefully a nice rifle isnt too far away.
---
I think you can get some of them from venders, but the shielded mod I think is a reward from an event. I earned mine a long time ago and don’t recall how I got them. I’d say start at the BoS vender in Whitespring resort (he’s the protection in the outdoorsman type shop/easily identified by the T series power armor mods he sells). He may sell the treated lining I think. If he does, buy it, learn it, hop to a new server and he should selling the resistant lining, rinse and repeat again for the protective. I could be wrong about this, so if someone else fact checks me that would also be good. I know the enclave under armor works like this once you gain access to the bunker and for that particular set of under armor you can just buy your way to shielded (ends up costing about 2,000 or so caps.
---
3 perks of Iron Stomach and the Carnivore mutation gives spoiled meat a 0.9% chance to give a disease.
---
I've been stuck on my 200+ pile of spoiled meat for months now. Yum yum.
---
These rewards are... underwhelming. Yikes.
---
Ive been doing this for ages
---
No need to investigate this bug.
---
It’s a piece of shit. Your idea is good but I’d advocate for being able to convert what’s in your stash as well as what’s just on your person.
---
I never feel like they are pressuring me to buy stuff, I was kind of suprised because I was expecting it to be more of a pay to win kind of game, but even if I die alot in places I probobly shoulden't be because of my lvl I still don't actually loose, all I risk is that someone takes my loot, which is not really that bad. 
---
But I would like to know why you mean the PvP is broken?
---
Nah.
---
It should just take the maximum it can take out if the players inventory. Why would anyone not sell their max treasury notes?
---
Why even have the vendor screen at all? You should just have to click on it and it takes your treasury notes, up to a maximum of 20 a day.
---
They do the same thing with that mothman event at the lighthouse, so they clearly have this functionality.
---
Thanks a bunch I’ll go try this now!!
---
I always thought they were similar to Ghost People
---
When my BRC checkpoint was outside of foundation id have random brc people show up at my camp sometimes.
---
Yeah I saw they removed the earlier one now... oh well. Two wall sets would have been great but one is better than none.
---
What kind of junk?
---
exactly what i thought.  Same stuff, different pretty things that one go in my full camp
---
Glad i wasnt the only one
---
I assume youve checked out all the big farms
---
I dunno how this got put in given how obvious the broken UV map is
---
you can hack multiple prefixes on weapons
---
On another note, all BoS under armors use the same mods, so the knight, soldier, fatigues, etc will have the same mod. Should just say something BoS treated/resistant/protective lining, but it will apply to any BoS under armor.
---
people are paying for their own server. no hackers in a solo server
---
Better items. lol
---
They are very, very similar to the ghost people from dead money.
---
I got 2 ideas, it’s probably crazy but here goes nothing,   Pen+paper or notes on your phone
---
Thanks, I am hoping to find something soon, but it's okey. I am guessing this was just a rare odd and annoying meating with a wierd player.
---
I didn’t know that nor do I cheat at the game.  Just thought it looked suspect
---
2 coins per card you scrap
---
It happens so often for me I just check my favorite wheel when I log in and see if I need to fix anything.
---
On the train set it says "Gather your five closest friends and take a miniature world with the West Virginia Electric Train Set!" 
---
Ignoring the possible typo, minigame?
---
Also, you might try Grafton Train Station. The vender there sells the BoS mods for combat armor, he may have the under armor mods as well.
---
Ok, great content coming, but, u/Ladydevann or u/Valseek, are there going to be any daily and weekly challenges in that one week between seasons? Can we have at least that one week of old-school atom challenges, please?
---
Then who fucking cares how much of a "grind" it is? These aren't meant for everyone, and I sincerely doubt Bethesda were rubbing their hands together in the dark and cackling over the fact that everyone was going to have to spend 20 hours a day levelling up to have a 30 percent to blow things up when you punch them. 
---
As someone who is currently at rank 310 on my main I did a quick bit of accounting, and despite the fact that I know Ive fully respecced at least twice now (probably spending 20 - 30 points on moving things) I still have enough ancillary, unused perks to spend about 200 coins. Now I'm going to get an additional 50 coins on top of that? 
---
I dont really think that counts as a "grind", when you get the things as a side effect of playing the game. Just because a mechanic is there doesnt mean anyone HAS to devote their in game life to boosting it. 
---
So if you are choosing not to participate, why complain about what a grind it will be when it has no effect on you?
---
Its like being mad about the fact that the weather might be bad when you are planning on sleeping.
---
*Editing to add some stuff. 
---
Firstly (and I'm not going to edit it), sorry for starting off dickish and aggressive. That was not my intent.
---
Secondly - in my previously mentioned rough accounting of my perk cards, I dont think I included unopened perk packs in that list. I think my main has 17, which would add what, another 170 coins (2 coins per card X 5 cards per pack X 17 packs).
---
I also just took a look at the rewards for the next season, and you get 13 packs I think it was throughout the season, in addition to whatever you gain through level ups naturally. 
---
I have a feeling us less than casuals (players who've been around since the BETA or shortly thereafter) rolling up in 300+ levels worth of characters (either one dedicated high ranking toon, or multiples across many different levels) will be ranking these things up just fine.
---
You gotta make sure you get in a good loot pool before you start hammering them out tho. That could be your downfall.
---
Are you high? Rep takes forever to get! The gold just stays flowing. Especially if you decide to start working on armor. I havent even gotten one pice for my ss set and i have enough gold to buy the plans for the other 4 armors.
---
I'm not sure why they used a "computer" at all. They should have used a vendor system, which already has sliders built in.
---
Or at the very least use a crafting table system. It's not quite as intuitive but it makes more sense.
---
They literally chose the worst option.
---
Nice points. If you remove frog legs then you need a climb function which this engine is probably not capable of.  
---
  
---
I'd like to not have to favorite unfavorite my wheel items in order to access them 50% of the time. This is a newer bug.  
---
I'd like to see no one load in faster than me.  
---
Completely random crate spawns would be interesting.  
---
Biggest things I want is  
---
1.) reduced map radius, reduced player count, faster match finding times as a result, more action, faster matches, less conservative behavior because finding the next match would be instant.  
---
2.) solo or duos mode, split the player base if possible, or simply get rid of 4 player teams. Because going 1 vs 4 is possible and feels great when you successfully kill a team, but it's like hitting a home run and isn't likely against a coordinated team.  
---
3.) stats that you can show off and understand how well you are doing.  
---
4.) anti-cheat
---
Murder hobos bring shame to the hobo kind. Us here gangbang hobos make all hobos look better.

Still looking for that shiny red Prius.
---
After level 50 the only difference in players is their equipment and perk cards. Pvp damage is capped at like 110 hp so armor and perks play a huge role.
---
Earle is essentially 3 fused wendigos (wendigi?) and one of them just kinda dangles in the middle with his bum just floppin around all limp like. Its creepy
---
Thats why robo vendors cap out at 1400
---
So from Day one you can buy ranks... I give it 2hr after release I see post on here showing off everything.
---
Every time I reach max caps i just ditch server, come back and shut everything down/lock it up until I buy a bunch of stuff.  Happens quite a bit though, I would be spending the majority of my play time restocking my vendors if I just store them every time.
---
I believe some spawn in the locked armory rooms at both the big bend tunnel by line in the sand and the electrical pylon by the crashed airplane. I think there might also be some live ones in the trapped warehouse by mama dolces.
---
So either way your paying for it.
---
I agree
---
When in doubt...boil it out....when you shit your pants...its not time to dance...
---
Yes...
---
Okey, then I have something to look forward to, or at least it will be nice to know if I could defend myself on the rare occations I meet toxic players.
---
Server hop Grafton Day. You get a bunch as a reward.

It isn't so much that the BR is bad. The game mechanics of FO76 are bad. Therefor it's a bad BR. But also because they haven't even tried to make it good with new stuff every patch.

wait I thought it counts from the first time you every used the shop in constant 20 hour intervals?

I agree, I was just saying that he can't demand anything since Beth doesn't owe him anything at all

I like it mostly because then i have to be more knowledgeable of what is sellinng and what is staying.

"The hydraulic bracers and motion assist servos seem to be taking up space. Maybe I should just suitcase them at white springs."
---
Exactly. But this is the most skill dependent perk card. If you are someone like Shroud though, you can own with it. (or aimbot ;)
---
Sometimes you just gotta eat it raw.....no time!!
---
Awesome, I'll try that. Thanks!

Because they dont think about any of that.  Isn't it obvious all this shit is thrown together with almost no actual gameplay thought.  This is just another cash shop that takes time instead of money.
---
Headshots, I’ve only pulled off a dozen. I prefer to aim for the chest and forget the rest.
---
When doing the “explore hornwright headquarters” miscellaneous quest after first entering Charleston, I found it so interesting to see the mole miners in the basement, and I immediately assumed from the encounter and loading screen information that these miners had become trapped in the tunnels after the bombs, likewise becoming trapped in faulty mining suits due to corporate penny-pinching, and slowly over the years devolved into the lumbering moles we find in the wasteland now.

I was playing when the stash was 400 pounds. And they bumped it to 600 and it was immediately swallowed up even though we all were like, nah man I am gonna *ration* these 200 pounds out like it’s the last roll of toilet paper.  Then they bumped to 800 and the same thing happened. Then they gave FO1st scrap boxes and that opened up unlimited scrap and effectively gave me 200 free pounds which was gone overnight. 
---
It doesn’t matter. They can give us 2000 pounds. They can give us five tons. We will use it all and then some. We are all hoarders at heart and the only answer is unlimited storage and that will *never* happen. 
---
Now CAMP budget... that’s an idea I can get behind... 😂
---
huh, didn't know that those existed. That sounds amazing
---
yeah, I can see how chewing gum would do that to someone.
---
Haha yah.... I do an extra inventory evaluation every few weeks anyways to drop prices, scrip things, and like you said drop a mess of plans
---
Unfortunately I am worried what's left of my friends list will do the same
---
The ammo converter could replace the ammo venders at the train stations that nobody uses, and people who got it in the legendary run or bought it with gold bullion just get the luxury of using it in their camp. Then the addition of a new currency is then viable and even usable as quest rewards!
---
I would agree, but there's a chance that every legacy weapon in the game would get wiped, which is bad
---
thats all events. if you die in any event you do not drop your junk guess it is a counter to griefing. just remember to drop it off asap after events.
---
Give full Chameleon armor to all players allies and make them invisible
---
Food build
---
5. don’t keep every piece of junk or weapon in your stash :o)
---
From what I understand it is 20 hours from the first time you use it when it resets
---
YEAH, gimme an Enclave Plasma Caster and Gatling Plasma Skins
---
You can, but it’s easier to just run pacifist mode. The only spot where pvp is even a concern is workshops. The way pvp is getting killed off in this game means that probably won’t be a issue much longer. When the game first came out you could still be killed in pacifist mode and people could destroy your camps. Now you have to try very hard to engage pvp. For someone like me who doesn’t like the pvp aspect of this game it’s been a welcome change, but I have a number of friends who have quit playing because they loved pvp and hated the changes.
---
Batten down the hatches because it's going to get UGLY with this change
---
Been away for a few months, but it’s been a big since the get go.
---
Edit: bug*
---
I see you on every post being an asshole. Did your wife's boyfriend not give you enough puter time or did you miss your 4 o clock pegging session. There's a way of communicating with people without being a dick, nobody thinks you're a chad, nobody thinks you're superior, you're just a dick.
---
Get a piece of armor with blocking legendary effect and VATs will melt with that shotty.
---
Agreed seems like heavy weapons are really lacking in skins in general
---
Sorta? I sprint past most of them looking for scrap.
---
I agree I’ve been playing since beta I understand that completely. now that you say that I probably wouldn’t ever be satisfied tho lol. Oh well I guess my post got removed I didn’t know that there are things that get suggested a lot that everyone’s probably tired of hearing about lol my bad people
---
I like my hand made skins, Just wish we had some for the fixer too
---
Yes.
---
Big?
---
I wonder what u/wildlust thinks.
---
yo it doesn't matter if I buy stuff right after the reset or 10 hours after the reset because the next one is always 20 hours after the last one right
---
Life is a race. 
---
Win.
---
The update is in two weeks, and it should be fixed when it goes live.
---
That's better than their response to bug reports and cries for help with auto completion, they just auto lock those...
---
started when it hit 0€ on gamepass 2 weeks ago and am 100 hours in lol
---
Well I guess we're still dealing with some Fallout from switching the algorithm from the old one to the new. We basically rewrote it into something two orders of magnitude more complex. And it blew up into our faces showing bullshit results like 40k for bloodied limbdamage melee weapons, and making people angry.  
---
That's the nature of this type of the tool. With hundreds of thousands of possible combinations, making a mistake that flops the values for small fraction of those combinations (measly multiple thousands) is quite easy, and knowing you made a mistake requires you to hit particular set of variables, which might, but might not be, the ones that were tested most extensively.  
---
But the work had to be done because the previous one was not complex enough to mark up all the nuances of players market. The current one is, it's really damn complex, but because of its complexity, calibrating it is much harder. It's still a great adventure, and the support we get makes it very well worth the energy investment. Helping people feels just awesome. Posts of new players showing up a clear godroll and saying they wanted to scrip that item, but apparently the site likes it very much - that is really hard to beat.
---
Damn they really are going all in on this perk coin BS. How many players need to them it’s horrible before they listen? Does everything in this game have to be a mind numbing grind? Didn’t we already grind the xp? Wasn’t that enough?
---
I’ll let him speak for himself but I understand what he means the community has had awesome ideas that fell on deaf ears I don’t think scrapping perk card is rly the best way to go about acquiring legendary cards but I don’t make the game I just play it so I guess we’ll have to live with their decisions I just hope it’s not as grindy as it seems as of today
---
Turn on damage numbers display and you'll know for sure. Any reason not to carry both?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
It states:
---
&gt;Season 2 Begins September 15 and runs through mid-December.
---
Still nothing regarding nuclear proliferation? That’s a shame. I’ve been looking forward to that perk.
---
Would have been great if at the very least we could become ghoulified.
---
Until I can't...
---
If you use the vendor at noon then it will reset the next day 4 hrs before noon I believe
---
Which would probably make it even easier solo. I may have to try that, thanks for the info
---
I enjoy the game solo, but I also enjoy playing with my friends, some moved out of state, so this is how I socialize with them as I don't get to see them very often :(
---
I tend to move camp locations and build complete new camps from scratch every few months. I watch a lot of youtubers that build cool stuff and also take ideas from other very detailed camps I see and come up with some new ideas. I enjoyed minecraft for many years, so this part of the game appeals to me.
---
That global damage nerf needs more work before it goes live, its going to cause you to loose so many players!
---
It was from the ITV that they were discussing. Said 10 weeks, thats the other source thats causing conflicting results in time.
---
You can't get Possum badges until after you completed that questline as you should know. I did notice that doing some quests would at random give the higher ones like the Tidy quest. I'm going to see if I can find out which ones do it at a higher %.
---
Theres some atom challenges but alot of them are still bugged
---
Buff revolvers and ALL explosives/grenades. Remove one wasteland from the schedule. Replace the current system with the original skills from when fallout was still a rpg and make perks into actual perks that you only get every few levels again. Add bluegrass and classic country to the radio.
---
&gt;If there was a reason to blow tons of caps faster than most people could earn them, prices for most things would fall.
---
Case in point: the very first treasure hunter event was clearly an emergency cap sink designed to combat the holiday gift duping that occurred just a few weeks prior.
---
I hadn't seen so many items being sold for caps since the early days of the game.
---
You don’t need “reddit cred” to voice your opinion bro.  Who cares if some dope with too much time on their hands dosen’t like what you have to say.  Speak your mind and don’t worry what others think.  Also Well put!
---
Woah buddy leave some for the rest of us. It's not toilet paper.
---
Just like a god....
---
Yeah, I have the feeling that he probably invested some time into coming up with some ideas for legendary cards that got like no attention and is just still pissed at beth
---
They used to be an underarmor up until like a month ago (coincidentally when the new bos stuff from project atlas started showing up) it now is a cosmetic outfit thats un-moddable.
---
Ok, interesting.
---
Still don’t know why they didn’t use the trading UI for it
---
If they can do it to use scrip or bullion instead of caps they can do it for ammo points
---
Season 137, done.
---
**&gt; S**orry **C**ould **O**nly **R**elease **E**xcrement
---
I quit playing for about a year and just came back to see what might have finally been done to make the game fun again...
---
I'm level 272 and have 11 levels that I haven't used yet. I've probably used between 10 and 20 levels changing my build out of boredom
---
Can someone give me some advice on where I stand with regards to this' 'perks-for-coins-for legendary perks?'
---
I'd like to maximize my 'cashing in' but don't quite understand how this is going to work...
---
Thanks!
---
try moving around, sometimes NPCs that aren't hostile will hamper your ability to fast travel as if they where hostile, chloe is a good example, but often times there will be a create that still has direct line of sight on you if your in wilderness.
---
Okey, I thought I would still take damage so I haden't put on my pacifist mode yet, but I will try it out then. I don't really like PvP either, I'm just starting to get used to the multiplayer aspect. But I did find him annoying and wanted to teach him a lesson. I know it makes me sound petty, but it might have tought him not to try to ruin the game for others.
---
Ghouls and Scorched both give glowing meat if they wind up in a blast zone. Mole Miners are just mutants, its not more complicated than that.
---
This is perfect. I am now on the lookout for a vampiric (or bloodied) + swing speed bone club. :P
---
Can I also land on those said Vertibirds with my jet pack then hail Iron Rain and 40mm shots onto our enemies plzbethesda
---
What Jake said and but if I had to choose...anti armor. With the damage debuff coming up...anti-armor will stand strong!
---
Robot armor seems to be the best all around protection.    
---
Depending on  what mods then you can mod to your liking but it is heavy. Scout armor is very light.
---
Eliminate all of the silly gating. Make three stars drop three star items. Make all learned plans shared across the account.
---
Switched from Xbox to PC recently and it’s blatant AF
---
Major boss fights are over before anyone can get a shot in because some wanker can’t play a game as easy and casual as this legit
---
So they are the Brahminhood of Milk now?
---
Are you sure? I see people get killed at the Encrypt even and they drop lots bags with stuff
---
Well I would say the blades should hurt you :o to deter peeps from being on top. Would be funny if someone tried to get on and they got choppered
---
On all 10 items.
---
At this level it often comes down to which one you prefer.   Some people love anti armor while others will scrip it every time.  Same with Executioners.   
---
Maybe look at your on hand ammo.  Run through WesTek and look at ammo count again.  Now hop servers and do it again with the other gun.  Was there much difference in ammo used?   Might give an idea of effectiveness with your play style.
---
Dont wanna sound dumb, but what are daily ops?
---
I'm actually really good with both my character's and stash inventory. But for me it's mainly ammo I'm waiting to convert. My stash is usually under 600lbs and my character is usually at 130.
---
Rep is hard. One quest a day?
---
That's a good guess. For gameplay, 76 does a bad job of showing coal being almost depleted. Maybe it was intentional after all?
---
HA! I played a couple of hours. Great stuff. BUT. I finally got my hands on a ps4 and final fantasy 7 remake so i've been seeing that behind fallout 76s back.
---
I usually just do the “no” or “throwing up” emote when someone tries to pvp. You have to shoot back in order to activate it. There’s also been a problem with the electrically charged, plague walker and unstable isotope mutations activating when someone hits you. That can unintentionally start pvp, so the best bet is to leave pacifist on. If they won’t leave you alone block them for session and hop servers.
---
You don't want people crashing their Vertibirds into your C.A.M.P? Awwww c'mon
---
Oohhh really?
---
Oh this is hilarious.  Finally a bug that hits Bethesda where they actually care.  They'll fix this as fast as they possibly can, meanwhile every other tiny game mechanic in the game is busted in a dozen unique ways.
---
If its added in some way probably. Im not beth just guessing. Just going off what they did with the last few items like the new armor bench skin from 1st that was suppose to be a season 1 reward.
---
What's up with everyone wanting plushies, this post apocalyptic wasteland is fucking weird.
---
Oh haha yeah good point
---
I am glad I could help. What system, xbox?
---
"Oh it turns out we are able to change your atoms on just this one occasion somehow".
---
Time to get a *moooooove* on!
---
But you are ignoring that players wouldn't be "starting at 0" under the old system:
---
1. Player A is level 200 and has never used a single level up to alter his SPECIAL ranks.  This player uses 80 perks for his build and utility (crafting etc) so he has 280 extra perks he simply doesn't need which = 560 perk coins
---
2. Player B is level 200 and tried out a couple of builds, using a total of 25 level ups to move his SPECIAL ranks. This player uses 80 perks for his build and utility (crafting etc) so he has 255 extra perks he simply doesn't need which = 510 perk coins
---
   1. Player B did all of this 8 months ago, long before he could have possibly known that he was throwing away 50 perk coins.
---
Bethesda is making a gesture to no screw over player B who otherwise would be in a 50 perk coin deficit in relation to people who made the optimal choice and never respecced their SPECIAL.
---
Granted this new concession doesn't really solve the problem as player A still has an advantage but I suppose the extra 50 coins for player B is at least something.
---
Complaining is defined as expressing dissatisfaction or annoyance about something.  So yeah, I guess I'm complaining.   I'm not impressed by the legendary perk system as is, at all, so I expect to be dissatisfied when I had high expectations. After all, i was led to believe that it would be cool and, in my opinion, it's just not.
---
I think I Implied pretty clearly that the requirement for matching armor pieces annoys me by declaring it as dumb.  But to be clear, it's the dumbness that annoys me because I have higher expectations.
---
I have every right to feel the way I do and express it as I have.  And technically, expressing dissatisfaction/annoyance is complaining, so I have every right to complain.  It's strange that you seem to have a problem with that.
---
I think it’s bullshit that people should have to worry about being banned when it’s the game that’s fucking up. Fix the game Bethesda, these issues are on you not the players
---
Still surprised on how fast they fixed his exploit since gold doesn't effect RMT and in-game economy
---
The script notes for the scene where Duchess bends over to get something literally says "thicc"
---
Someone oughta write a song!
---
Yes, I am on Xbox.
---
It's all junk to me
---
Totally agree. I was like, that looks like fun skin I’ll never get to use. I’m an axe man
---
I disagree. The goofy makes the game. It’s not fallout without the silly satire.
---
and people, judging by her description of the free states
---
It appears to have multiple causes.
---
Get em! *hiss*
---
A lot of Fallout lore nerds seem to miss this kind of nuance. Some characters aren't reading the script and *sometimes they even lie*.
---
If you die after the sheepsquach they you can loose your junk at encryptid. Otherwise normal public event rules apply and junk is safe if you die and she’s still alive.
---
September 15th if it doesn't get delayed.
---
This becomes everyones end game eventually. just an old trader that cant adventure anymore. Not since it took that arrow to my knee. Sophia I call her, damn arrows slow us all down eventually.
---
Something happened like this on eso and people got in trouble for spending it so I wouldn't spend it
---
Is it single player or online? Rpg or fps?
---
Oh nice didnt know that
---
mine worked, but i had to move it to the C Drive
---
Oh yeah like kill the SBQ! And find Berkeley
---
Personally I like more of the rewards from season 2 but there are also rewards I couldn't care less about.
---
Ok, ill keep a lookout for you. I get a lot of vampires, although god rolls are rare see if we cant get the doctor on call as soon as we can. 
---
I do often look at posts and vendors with others in mind, and you would be the 4th im keeping in mind while shopping/trading.
---
Meh... still think its a pretty steap cost for something you might not like or fit your playstyle... But with the costs so high Im assuming this is going to lead into certain Quests/Events/Dailys/Challenges that reward you with perk points. Atleast I hope so.... Personally id like to see a Quest or Challenge where you would unlock a particular Legendary Perk and "then" perk points to upgrade it..
---
So you have a homemade handmade????
---
If you're on xbox, I'd be willing to build you whichever one you like, no cost.
---
I got my plans at the watoga bos vendor
---
Other way around, it was an underamor bugged into being an outfit, it’s fixed now
---
those vending machines must be owned by a company and takes a percentage as apposed to renting. thats quite a royalty they don't even give you the machine its just branding they provide and lets be honest exploit i mean any vending machine. 
---
have to roleplay it somehow. ya it does not make a lot of sense how it is implemented though.
---
Now that's a lot of Atoms!
---
I think that would be easier...but harder for them...since not  All bullets are the same amount They'd have to have each bullet have it's own thing with its own slider that's a lot of code having to be added into a game where we already have broken code.
---
*some*, not overwhelmingly
---
Somehow I read power patrol and thought paw patrol. I swear my head is gone some days more than others. 
---
Just kept thinking "why would they put paw patrol themed items in this game?" Then started imagining the different characters as power armor sets. I think chase would be most impressive.
---
That’s a glitch I want
---
I guess they just trust their Overseer.
---
at least i don't need a throwaway to talk shit
---
Post a screenshot plz
---
600 is more than you can get from the queen, considering you might not even get the flux you need to make the ammo you use. And if you do it will be 2 at most.
---
I'm more annoyed that they haven't even bothered to implement the NW UI improvements into adventure:
---
\- Color coded items
---
\-  Effects listed on weapon wheel
---
It's like they treat the two as separate games, but they're not.
---
East Coast Mole miners are midgets, they were much taller &amp; a bit more frightening at the Sierra Madre Hotel from New Vegas.
---
Exactly the reason why i am so helpful and willingly to take the task of minnions-terminator on me, as side effect of looking around to spot any spawn i spot sometimes a player in distress although ive i find the player to low level, like "he shouldnt be here at all" i Just ignore those, fuck them 😮
---
I spend 1k on the queen, and i get more flux
---
It won’t die, it’s the same as SBQ. People always grind the event regardless of the plans. Great for Treasury Notes and up to 3 3* legendaries.
---
I been sayin this since launch. Preach, my friend. 
---
Only way to get them to REALLY fix the game... like REALLY actually fix it is to hit their bottom line. People should've stopped playing a long time ago out of protest. 
---
Unfortunately, this community has a severe case of FOMO and can't stand to miss out on a single day of this good ol Modern Classic.
---
Still not enough to buy everything in the store 😅
---
That's what I do now. Somebody gave me the 'come here' emote repeatedly the last event I played but I just passed thumbs up to them. I hope they got out OK.

Yes, it’s only for pc. They have no plans to add a PTS to consoles.
---
answer - get an ethernet cable
---
It's not, I just don't come to reddit often, nice try though. 10/10 still an asshole. Still not superior, nobody cares.
---
I appreciate it a lot! I've been a crazy clown for almost 70 levels now (grognak's before that). It'd be nice to spice it up a bit, haha.
---
Dunno, I'm still liking it when it works.  The screws and ammo are nice.  I've joined the "Stay in the mine and loot screws until it collapses" crowd.
---
It would be nice if they would rotate through different loot pools occasionally.
---
Happened to me a few times during the Run, twice now since I hit 100. The first time it was counting through to 100, I tried to play through it, but every time I wanted to go to the map etc, instead of showing the map when I hit Esc, it showed me the game board. Second time I got it since making 100, I just crouched in a corner and went to get a snack IRL.
---
Then why did it mesh properly with armor?
---
Nothing beats my vampire fast fire 90rw plasma rifle with a flamer barrel 
---
It practically makes you invincible
---
You're so hilariously stupid its amazing. His entire point goes right over your head and its making you upset. Smoke some weed and chill the fuck out, kid
---
This.
---
Of course it is. PC gamers get all the best stuff 😭😭
---
That's how to do it. I usually focus fire on Earl, but if I notice the spawns are getting up there or team mates are going down, I'll breakaway for clean up and pick up.
---
Is... this not what workshops are designed for? High risk/high reward pvp zones?
---
You couldn’t pay me to play this game on pc. It’s a hack fest. Nuclear Winter is almost unplayable.
---
Same, I did the same with wood, I may now have much the the cause can have all I have.
---
This is good idea. Perhaps I should bring execution to earl as well. The anti armor does not even dent him but maybe executioner help when he gets to half health?
---
No :/ I bought wood for 400 caps lol thanks tho man!
---
Damn them!!! Stealing my Atoms. I just want the Theramin and some nice flooring!
---
Read this in AlChestBreach voice. Thanks for that.
---
Death and taxes, love. Death and taxes.
---
&gt;To the 4 team of Lv. 200 guys who raided my workshop  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Thanks. I needed an excuse to get off.
---
Oof. Whatever floats your boat I guess...
---
I dunno man. Was on earlier and saw a dude pop open ACP. None of the high lvls on the server (150+) bothered to come except himself (lvl 206). I kept watch on the map as he went in with 3 people, who honestly werent a good enough lvl to win as a trio, take on Earle for only a couple of mins, before none of their icons appeared in the mine anymore. ACP was still active. I dunno how he feels about a wasted effort to launch the nuke. Must be bad. This event got people lop-sided or somethin
---
Considering I don't play NW and still got the glitch, I'm going to have to second this reply.
---
Has any one else stated getting a bug where, if you fast travel to you camp it traps you under one of your foundations.
---
Maybe I should do that! The race to exit the mine was exhilarating the first few times and then the Wendigos just became super annoying.
---
well, I’m level 410. I play on console and I started playing ACP as soon as it was released. on the first week I’ve completed it over 40 times. got all the rewards multiple times. 
---
completed it with just another 2 players. completed it with a bunch of low lovels. completed it four times naked, no armor no underarmor. and I’m not doing it anymore. it’s instanced, so if the other 7 players cant pull their weight I’ll be using lots of ammo to finish it. SBQ is different. everybody can join. and I can kill her a lot faster than earle, and wasting less resources. 
---
and the rewards are better. I use those improved repair kits and I still have some ultracite plans to learn. 
---
so I’m done with earle. nice event, but no incentive to do it anymore. I’d rather farm fertile soil for that forest camo jumpsuit.
---
Yeah, I probobly have to read up to how you do stuff like that. I do know how to put my pacifist mode on though. He diden't really try to PvP, just shot towards my general direction when I was checing out the containers.
---
4 dudes get you off???
---
Awesome ! Thanks !!
---
It sparks joy
---
I could be wrong but I don't think that exists in the game.  If it is there, I've never seen it and I've got a lot of hours.
---
I bought it on steam so no pts only on bethesda launcher I think. I met a hacker one time since I play. Started in June this year.  Guy went under the map in NW.
---
Using the ammo converter interface makes me want to quit playing the game, I fucking despise it. Any change would be a vast improvement in my books.
---
PC only. Bethesda launcher only.
---
I get some sick satisfaction knowing that valseek read this comment... but then I get a sense of sickened dread knowing that they (or anyone from the team)  will never directly respond to being called out on shit like this.
---
I don't think it'll be an issue of whether or not they will keep playing it. People will definitely like they do with the SBQ to this day.
---
It's more a matter of how often.
---
I can see this dying off in popularity but never to the point where it's rare. Way too much XP, screws and guaranteed 3\* to give up.
---
Tesla rifle needs a skin
---
I don't mind low levels being in the event, I just know I'll be carrying them through every time (I'm Lvl 783)... With that said...I will kill Earle all by myself, just don't get butthurt when I don't waste Stimpaks on you...Staying alive is your own responsibility.
---
That's...that's $8,000 dollars.
---
Good for you. There are 5 different kinds and you arent gauranteed to get the kind you need. You can rationalize all you want but you get gauranteed ammo back from earl, not the queen. You can keep convincing yourself you're right, I'm done.
---
I was actually editing my statement as you replied to apologize for being a dick. 
---
I was more just (poorly) attempting to poi t out you were seeming to devote negative energy to something that would not seem to effect you, which I have found to personally be a terrible use of my time (nut I'm a wrestling fan who plays Bethesda games so I'm REALLY fucking guilty of doing it myself as well).
---
As for the armor thing, I did think it was stupid as well until I read that it also applies to matching power armor. I think the additional resistances for power armor users should help mitigate some of the downsides of not being in full unyielding gear for bloodied users might be of sone benefit in nuke zones or harvesting ore during radiation rumble.
---
I think running at least 4 of the 5 armor/power armor perks for a power armor user is the way to go. Electrical Absorption seems fine but the proc rate looks too low for me to rely on. Although it apparently also causes health regen as a side effect, so that may bump it up for some if thats a feature, and not a bug they intend to patch out.
---
Umm... enjoy the freedom I guess...?
---
But... but... +8 special +25% xp + 75 carry weight.....
---
\~16 lb per weapon would a very compelling reason to only carry one.
---
Your game is garbage, so many bugs so much wallet thievery on your part, you'll ban everyone who has this glitch happen to them then you'll pull some lame excuse out of your ass and call them cheaters, who knows. You'll keep pushing out abortion grade content while simultaneously ignoring all ACTUAL game breaking bugs and call it good, that's what you've always done and as long as you have a community full of drooling tards that enable you, you'll do it. But what the fuck do I know, I'm on the other side of the spectrum, a fan watching the fallout series go up in flames, and you don't care about the real ones like us.
---
Unless you happen to be the minigun. If I recall correctly it has the chrome skin, the gilded skin, Halloween bat skin, the brotherhood of steel skin, the shark hot rod skin, and the vault-tec skin. Four of those skins are attainable through nuclear winter.
---
This is literally all I do. As I’ve gotten older my ability to react to some things has really decreased so this is the only way I feel like I can contribute.
---
I also dumb hundreds of plans on newbies everytime I see a low level pop out who isn’t head to toe in store skins.
---
Thank you for saying this. I honestly wasn’t sure if doing this was really even helping.
---
I randomly get a bass issue that is similar. It's not constant, but anytime I do anything or something procs it goes off. Sound familiar? Or is yours just a jam session?
---
Oh, PC by the way
---
If you apply the asbestos mod to your armor torso, the falling embers do no damage at all.  Just watch out for the bubbling pools of acid and you are golden.
---
I was always sure I wasn't the only old fart playing this game. As soon as I turned on the radio I was hooked. I wish those under 50 could see this franchise from our perspective.  Remembering a lot of the songs. Seeing stuff like cigarette machines and smiling because that's exactly what some looked like. And so much more.
---
Also happy cake day.
---
Be very careful what you do with those atoms.  I don't know what bethesda's policy will end up being but there are some companies out there that will drop you into a negative balance if you spend currency gained via a bug and make you pay your way out of the hole.
---
AA is consistently the better weapon. True test would be to test out both weapons on a strong enemy that takes a while to take down e.g. Scorchbeast. Do one after the other (travel to fissure sites) and compare results (making note of SB level too!). 
---
One should clearly stand out over the other.
---
Because it only has 5-10 people playing it
---
Give the scrap box to everyone as that was a real shitty thing to monetize and hide behind a paywall.  
---
Also remove all hacked weapons and remove the ability to make new ones.  
---
Lastly do a MASSIVE bug fixing wave.
---
Someone dropped me a vampires explosive gatling plasma with a splitter on it. Im not even speced into heavy weapons but thats making me reconsider
---
Yea as of now I’m just gonna let them sit. I already have a ton of atomic shop stuff already so it’s not itching me to spend them.
---
What the heck is this? I haven't seen any of these amazing sounding things!
---
A very small portion of your screen?
---
Legendary Run level-ups, regular level-ups, quest/event completed messages (and animations), and the emote/quick-pick wheels each take up roughly the same place in the center of the screen, which is about 40% of the width and 50-60% of the height. That's definitely not a 'very small portion' by anyone's metrics.
---
I hadn’t thought of the XP....maybe it is slow because people waiting for season 2 to start.
---
Theres a five guys joke in here somewhere....
---
Just one: the Assault Rifle.
---
it just works
---
They also have a couple markets for other mole miners, featuring items like scrap metal, miner’s caps/helmets, plates, and lots of duct tape. The biggest is over at Blackwater Mine, and not particularly obvious as a market, but the open air stalls in the Ash Heap and Savage Divide are very much set up like little markets.
---
lol with that you dont even need to spec into heavy.
---
Not a fan of the communist centrict items from this season despite literally being named and about the American GI Joe like group; wtf is up with that. Eery amount of communist gear in this game and next to no "Patriotic" gear. 
---
Dunno why they couldn't just have more ingame things if they want Chinese stuff to be able to players; what we got the officer sword and the dragoon suit? Why not include the Chinese ak from fo3 or the uniform from fo3/fo4? I just find it really weird that in a game set in post apocalyptic America especially in the context of being a pre war American  that your options for being such are rather limited. I understand the roleplay aspect and you could have people turn after finding out what happened and losing faith etc but come on, options from everyone please..
---
Still awaiting some pre war yank weaponry like maybe WW2 stuff akin to FNV, R91 (seriously what happened with that one), Armalite platform etc. About the best we got was an atom shop skin that isn't available for the handmade with Screaming Eagle and you can't even get carry handle sights for it (apprantly you can with glow sights but I can't for the life of me find that mod on one or break one down and get it). Just one of those thing with fo76 you know? Rather untouched region considering and it's only 25+ years after the bombs and yet the weapon choices are poor as fuck especially considering the whole MMO level deal on top of that as well
---
Yes! I just have to find the budget for it
---
Higher level players always drop stuff off for me and it’s the nicest thing! I must start doing the same for new players!
---
Ooo legacy ve gat plas I loved mines they work like an dream *(♡ω♡ )*

What he or she said.
---
The chance for food poisoning should increase as the food degrades... mmm carpaccio.
---
LOL!
---
ALL of anything meaningful in this game is centred around consoles - control scheme, UI, keybinds (and the lack to openly customise them), frame rate limit and the list goes on.
---
Aside from one update in the first month after launch and the occasional whipping boy status PC gets to test and polish things before they're presented to their royal highnesses Xbox and PS4, PC gets nothing.
---
The singular advantage PC has are mods and that's only because of the community, not Bethesda.
---
I mean what if I use my bloody gatling laser? Or plasma? It's cheaper and more rewarding to fight the queen, especially due to weapon breaking. I've killed earl over 50 times already, and the queen hundreds of times
---
And did you miss that she costs less? If I spend 2k and get 600 back, but 4 less flux, and no repair kits vs spending 1k I'm up 400 ammo after the fight if I do the queen. 
---
People like you are why jc penny almost failed after they stopped doing fake sales and listed for actual price. 
---
And don't mention treasury notes I've got 1k+
---
Treasure Hunter outfit originally coupled with the Ranger Helmet, however now I wear the Reclaimed Miner Mask. Also the Secret Service and Croc Backpack strapped to my back
---
yeah, I dont think most developers give a shit about PC, its like a real wasteland on that, i don't think there's 1 game out there without hackers. even huge games with billion dollar anti cheat, it will always find a way over there
---
Just wondering, do you have calibrated shocks for ultracite? Im dying to get them m8
---
Very true I think the only other heavy skins are gold for the .50 cal and the thunder pipe which is a season reward.
---
I do believe the flamer has vault tec and another and maybe the missle launcher but unsure.
---
I mean, I do use the nuke icon and I don't use stealth in silos just in case the people on my team happen to notice. But to be safe I assume that it's not reliable that I'll get significant assistance / attendance unless I've directly asked and gotten some kind of mic or emote response. 
---
But I'm also not at the point where I can solo Earl or even SBQ... I feel like I'll probably still attempt to notify people then too though, cuz I'm an extrovert and I like the interaction and seeing everybody's outfits &amp; weapons &amp; etc.
---
plasma is ok. a really good but ammo sink is plasma flamer barrel. laser is hardly usefully even at lower levels. the gats have rof on their side though and are pretty good weapons both laser and plasma for your heavies. it would be interesting if they had a lighter gauss type rifle they have the pistol and shoty. the gauss is sort of a hybrid energy/ballistic weapon.
---
What could they possibly do to EBay sellers? They gonna perform Fallout 76 sting operations?
---
still missing this, m8 :/
---
here’s what I’m missing from barbara
---
ultracite reactive plates, ultracite tesla coils, ultracite calibrated shocks, ultracite optimized servos.
---
It’s a bug with atoms atm where you can get insane amounts
---
I've enjoyed wasteland 3 up until fishlips glitched my game totally. Every save got corrupted. So pissed. When they update again maybe they will be fixed. The issue is I can not travel anywhere at all and if I am in an interior cell I can not travel out nor take actions. If I try to do the fishlips I get stuck in combat if he surrenders, if I kill everyone it never leaves combat.   
---
I was having fun but man that game got more broke than FO76 every has for me.  I know other people ran into the same kind of issue with the cave in the south, paint cave, and santa's workshop.   
---
So back to doing 9 ACP a day for me and glitching magazines so I never run out in 7000 hours.  Maybe I will make a new camp also.
---
Congrats on the orgy.
---
Lol
---
An auto gauss rifle sounds amazing ngl
---
Mole miners remind me of cousin it, I always feel guilty killing them.
---
setteler laborer outfit, sack hood with straps, and the red scare backpack
---
You watch. If it hasn't happened already, there will be a time when people are mostly done with ACP where high level players will write posts telling players how they're playing the event wrong and should run the timer down to the last seconds before killing off Earle to maximise the number of wendigos spawned and thereby XP and screws.
---
You're probably right about the slowness. Regulars I normally see on my friends list haven't been around in around for a week or so (once Meat Week ended). We'll see in due time.
---
I still dont understand the perk coins or the legendary cards....dont we already have them...they are the ones that have the animation....no?
---
pvp vats has been broken for a very very very long time. I recommend avoiding pvp, or avoiding vats. 
---
if your vats can even hit the player, which is rare, you usually get them to one health and the vats won't ever kill them, no matter how many shots you put in, the last bullet won't kill in vats
---
Early Christmas gift from Todd and the rest of the team
---
Making a new character I seem to get a lot of support too. I don't need the items, but don't know how to be nice and decline offers.
---
Hehe I used all 20  in one hit so I could get 40 atoms. Checked my stats to see how God like I was. Turns out only one at a time works so the unarmed buff was the only one active. Such is life
---
I fell through the map on PS4. After I walked far off the edge of it. 😂 That was a super crazy fun time.
---
imagine not using good doggie + can do, now that's an alpha build. I have been living on a diet of purified water and dog food for months now and I have ascended
---
Highkey if your a high level and your raiding a low levels workshop just to line your stash sincerely eat an entire penis
---
It's cool that it works with power armor but I still find it dumb that you can have mismatched power armor without sacrificing some serious combat effectiveness.  If they all work as a set, why shouldn't they work as a mismatched set?  In fact, I have to wonder to what extent it has to match.  Does it have to be have the same paint job?  What if one piece is a different level?  What if one piece of scout armor has different legendary effects?  If it has to match at all for some unbeknownst reason, they might as well have had to entirely identical.
---
And can we trust Bethesda to even code it right to distinguish if it's even matching?  I mean, the regular old weightless legendary effect on armor doesn't work sometimes.
---
I do have a lot of negative energy towards this particular thing that is really annoying me, mostly because I would really like to use perks like funky duds without having to craft four more prices of SS armor.  But some fashion diva at BGS says I can't have poison resist if my pants don't match my top...
---
Armor Ace and the Power Patrol is a parody of G.I. Joe. So yes.
---
This happens a lot when they have double tap AP rounds hitting you. It’s annoying af..
---
Still need to grind then huh
---
The whole game is a nickel and dime show. Why would you expect any different with customer support?
---
There's a lot of things that wouldn't fly with any reasonable business but this just isn't that kind of game or that kind of company.
---
Same here. Need three pieces of ss to completey set, but have a full set of fantastic vanguard ss I don't have the heart to scrip but will never see any use.
---
Fo1st is [broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/im5foz/problems_with_bugthesda_fo_1st_and_atom_glitch/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) right now
---
How about a pat on the head?
---
There there. Whose a good boy? You are. Yes you are! Yes you are!
---
Haha... I actually hadn’t seen the board, rewards, or read anything about season 2.  But after my post I looked at the rewards and yeah I agree it’s a GI Joe parody
---
Because they don’t care if you’re satisfied, only if you continue paying.
---
Please buy TSLA stock now, so that we may all become zillionaires.
---
&gt;If you are already level 50+ this Challenge will already be completed and the 50 Perk Coin reward will be added to your Perk Coin total automatically.
---
Let's just wait and see how bugged this will be right out the door....
---
They still haven't fixed the feral ghoul blood sample quest.
---
Winter jacket and jeans + gray knit cap.
---
buyexactly enough repair kits to repair all of your items and nothing else. they cant rebreak your stuff
---
Imagine if the next end game boss they do is something like the Mole Miner King
---
Wish they would have let their actual customer support team know that before they had me running in circles.
---
I thought I was the only one...
---
Well this is quite fortunate, oh look you only have 2200 atoms now that's quite strange
---
Swords...
---
Holy shit, lol. Share the wealth!
---
I’m starting a heavy guns character now, could I ask for clarification? What’s the bug? If you press reload it’ll swap out your old core to a new core, leaving the old core in your inventory?
---
Fair enough. I see your point. In this specific case, hacked weapons, I was able to report two players and Bethesda support replied stating that they took action. Of course, they didn't state specifics. But I get what you are saying. In my experience their support have been very hit or miss.
---
Same here.  I rarely play NW as I don’t have as much time as I’d like for the normal game let alone to also play NW.
---
Edit: if this happens on my game I’m buying out S1 and they can deal with it because of the other glitches like the autocomplete bug.  Not an exploit if their system is doing it.
---
thats a clever combination. remember white knight for the dmg from explosives to your armor.
---
I turn off the classical radio in the Whitespring train station so I can hear the vendor.
---
My UI is definitely not like that. Run level up notices are nowhere near the size of my shortcut/emote wheels. Maybe 25% at best.
---
For plasma cores I get and this is awesome for that but for fusion cores, is it really that big of a deal?
---
It's never bothered me much since I'm in PA anyhow and those prioritise the lowest capacity ones first and (thankfully) they seem to work seemlessly so it doesn't really cost you in any negative way really.
---
Hes rich to bad Bethesda will probably sue you for this
---
Good call. I’ve been using solar armor. It seems to last longer than other armors.
---
Just thinking about.
---
Careful of reasonable criticisms guys, a shill is downvoting 🙄
---
Upcoming grant? This is news to me.
---
Maybe that support tech said something that they shouldn't have...
---
workshops are for pvp :/ kinda a big old warning on your screen letting ya know
---
Whistling piss ass
---
Your vending machines are never safe, only way to prevent people from using them are to not build them....plenty of glitches that let you walk thru objects unhindered.
---
Not saying it's a bad strategy, just blabbering about other potential tools that the Devs gave us.
---
Have an ally? If you do get rid of them.
---
Tooling around with it a bit more. Yeah trying to get him into the drill sucks ass. Screw that.
---
Depends on your style but the SS backpack is my favourite one as it's pretty small, clean and fits with a lot of looks other than more outlandish stuff like raiders outfits.
---
Dysentery is just a term to describe extreme diarrhea.
---
It pains me to see everyone else living my dream
---
I used to have to dump them from my inventory all the time because I only wear PA for fighting the queen or Earle so it's a big deal in the QOL department.
---
ha!
---
There are all kinds of ways someone can get in your camp without picking the lock. If there is lag when they fast travel it can be possible to get inside before the walls spawn in. Certain windows you can just jump right through. Not to mention glitches that let you ghost through doors. Best advice, store your vendors.
---
Lmao you mad?
---
At what cost? Will it deplete your armour's condition by doing so?
---
If not, awesome. If so... judgement call I guess.
---
Nah, Bethesda too busy making cow and teddy bear outfits. Like who TF is sitting up there pitching these dumb ideas when they’re all brainstorming.
---
Entire reason I got carnivore mutation. I'll cook some things that have outrageous buffs but otherwise its eaten raw
---
People can glitch through some walls/doors and some of the windows you can just jump trough, also if you have workbenches near windows you can stand outside and use the bench to get in. 
---
if you have your vendors powered whilst hidden away people will go out there way to glitch in. 
---
Furthermore you can fast travel to your camp (if your vendors are powered) and they can just run through you camp before the walls even load in.
---
I'm torn between dying of laughter at the comments and reminding you disgusting scavvers that Disease Cures exist and I even sell them.
---
Sometimes certain heavy weapons will just reload for no reason even when the core still has plenty of life left in it. It's annoying because then you end up with partially depleted cores weighing you down instead of them being used up properly.
---
Yeah not much they can do when you can use 50 accounts
---
You CARRY food?
---
LOLOL.
---
Maybe haha. I just hope it’s soon. I want to play fo76 on Steam ASAP!
---
Yeah the rewards imo seem alot more appealing in season 2.
---
Oh God this made me remember counter strike
---
I've given up on it. I'm not sure how others have gotten on, but I've had rotten luck with this event.
---
If it doesn't glitch out by having Earle warp into the ceiling or the floor, then it ends up being a tedious slog and costing me massive amounts of ammo and stims. The large amount of very low level players that do nothing by die and then leave, doesn't help matters.  
---
It's a huge investment of resources, for very little return.
---
And as for the rewards, it's given be nothing but harpoon guns. And I'm not even joking, after 20-30 runs. It's gotten so bad that I actually dispute that "data mined drop rate" document that was doing the rounds, and I'm going to go on record here and say that document is incorrect.
---
The event plans I picked up from a suitcase at Sunnytop, and I eventually (after MUCH searching) found a player selling the pickaxe for 1k caps, which I snapped up. I'm now officially done, and that event can go screw (lol) itself.
---
Single player with a co-op feature. RPG focus. Fps elements. Open world but much larger than 76.
---
There is, to be fair and honest here, A LOT to get upset about with this game and circus act that puts it out. 
---
I just feel that this is stupid kind of on purpose and we really shouldn't be getting all hot and bothered by this, since like my (hopefully accurate) math shows, progress on this will be a lot better than people think. 
---
The big problem with making something cool is the potential to make something TOO good, to the point where everyone is doing the exact same thing. I anticipate everyone will run rank one of master infiltrator and I figure most people will start investing in ammo factory, but after that they become so negligible that they all play to niche interests and playstyles. 
---
I personally anticipate the legendary special cards will get the most use out of all of them since they at least allow us to run additional perk cards, which is going to have massive quality of life benefits.
---
Luck might be on my side today i hope i get some when i get home today i purchased a can of sprite from a machine and got 2
---
And their insistence to lock any tickets asking for help!
---
I can be big and scary and try to look like an authority figure too kid! See I called you kid that means I have authority over you!
---
Did I do a good impression of you? Ok might have been a bit mocking but every story deserves a bit of embellishing to make it truly inspiring.
---
Next time you wanna shut your vendors down, place a single floor somewhere in the open. Move your vendors and put them all on that floor, create a blueprint and then delete them. From what I’ve heard they will stay stocked if you blueprint them. Personally I have never done it, but I do know that the times I have moved my camp and then Placed my vendors out of the stored tab, They were still stocked
---
Edit...And if you don’t feel like creating the blueprint, put four walls and a roof on the floor that has the vendors on them. With no doors or windows I think it’s a lot harder for them to get to your machines
---
Watch this,  explains it all

I use carnivore and eat raw meat, i sell cooked meat. Way too many mechanics i dont have time for XD
---
Season one was basically Buck Rogers.  I’m thinking each season board will be a pastiche of various sci-fi/fantasy/war game/western pop culture themes from the mid 20th century.  Gunsmoke or Star Trek would be fun boards.  Alien Blaster and Single Action skins.
---
People are paying for more than a private server, but mainly only use the subscription for it. Still are paying for a broken ass game.
---
There will always be selfish dicks, the game world is no different than real life. Just shoot fast and attempt to land a hit, unfortunately there’s no better way. If Bethesda guarantees a legendary for everyone who shows up, everyone will save their ammo and wait for others to kill the legendary so they get free rewards.
---
Lol, whatever sour puss
---
the good group members make the emote to come over so everyone can tag it. the one shot'ers should have a secondary that can do enough dmg to tag when they are in groups. as in rl there are all types of people some may also be ignorant but most are probably just lazy and want to get it done fast to you outright trollers.
---
Or change the system like use the base cap value to give points and a set values to buy. Much simpler than an arbitrary point value to each ammo that has a value already set in game
---
Thank you!
---
I have a stupid shotgun and these types of pole use fixers and handmades so i physically can’t get close enough to get a hit before it’s dead
---
Another thing that helps is to connect it to a switch. By doing this and switching it OFF, you will not appear on the map as a vendor to everyone and only your team will see your camp. 
---
... On the flip side, this switch, in no way will make the vendors unable to buy from. Silly glitch, If someone goes to your base via team or just happens to be walking past can still purchase items from machine but most people will not visit you.
---
Workshops were so much more fun with team PvP.
---
Role play as a raider! Best things ever. Junkies adrenaline stealth commando. Powerful and realllllly fun
---
He is, but I agree... ye maybe I take it back. Cat wants people to die 'cause he's shit at the game? Ef that
---
You sure you got em all? Even that one place by the thing where that guy is?
---
I try not to buy when owner is near watching..that's a good tip they repair while you shop.another one I seen is 4 vending machines the near one is safe but soon as you take a few steps to the next poisoned. Kinda sucks but you start to notice these things.i bought all the flux a trap camp had a few days ago..felt good
---
This, dear sir or madame, is a legacy weapon. It no longer drops because of how much damage it does without perks. 
---
Enjoy it and dont take the splitter off.
---
😂😅
---
Just Carnivore by itself removes all chance for disease.
---
Incorrect, Assault Rifles scrapping for Modules was fixed in an earlier PTS patch. 
---
["Assault Rifles: Fixed an issue causing Assault Rifles to return Legendary Modules when scrapped."](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424974/what-s-new-in-the-pts-updated-sept-3/2?language%5B%5D=en)
---
That exactly what I thought too 🤣🤣
---
If they added proper logging for the movement of legendary items they could easily trace such sales through their supply chain.
---
Bro those cali shocks are rare. You I have done the queen enough to have 1000 repair kits and I have not gotten it. Only got it from a drop a friend got and gave to me.
---
Blows my mind that this behavior isnt bannable, or that people make excuses for it
---
It would make sense. Like, originally, some weapons required a high STRENGTH to be available.
---
There's no real engagement in PvP. No skirmishes. It's either someone bugging the shit out of you while you're trying to cook or use a vendor then putting a million rounds into you with a hacked or duped weapon. They had the right idea with having the survival server but they need to rework the weapons and armour systems to get PvP to a playable state. Mabey remove all the legendary effects in PvP so that everything is at a flat damage and resistance.
---
With any MMO you really need to have PvP and pve on seperate servers because you need the ridiculous op builds in pve but more stable and predictable effect in PvP. If you try and balance the two together it always ends up with one play style copping major nerfs in waves.
---
Wait... How else do you get coins? I thought the only way was to scrap other perk cards.
---
to a point yes if done moderately. However not to the excessiveness bethesda does it where it completely changes fallouts original identity
---
How do you not have the carnivore mutation?
---
why on earth are you shopping with flux on you
---
I'll double check, but I'm almost positive there's still a chance for disease on spoiled food with just carnivore.  
---
-Just looked, spoiled meat has a 7% chance for disease with only the Carnivore mutation.
---
Yo that might have been me, you on PS4?
---
Ah I see
---
Yea shottys are very tricky to use at events since their range is limited. If you can find a cheap handmade and use it for public events tagging, you should be able to land a few hits when the legendaries show up. If you can find an explosive one that’s even better, since often the splash damage from exploding bullets are enough for tagging.
---
Seems clear to me that OP bought the flux at the trap camp.
---
I mean, these guns weigh 20 to 30 lbs.  Can you pick it up?  Sure.    Can you fire it without blowing off your arm?  No.  (Some can, but not well).
---
And Gatling laser and plasma rifles
---
if someone has a lot of stuff in their vendors and its a locked room I just PA glitch in and check it out, curiosity  always gets the best of me.
---
 power them off.
---
There’s also a raider Gatling gun, and the flamer has the fireman paint too. But most heavy weapons are lacking
---
baited :P depot it asap then lmao
---
“Reported” lol😂😂😂
---
What do you think, she’s banned for life....
---
Thinking outside the scrap box!
---
Don’t worry. In two weeks, you won’t even need to use your mouth - just shove a survival syringe into your body and you’ll be right as rain (warning: may be habit forming).
---
I needa log on ASAP
---
Someday, gauss rifle... someday.
---
This is a nightmare my friend, I would never wish this upon a soul
---
I would bet the trap camp owner waited for the purchase notification and then immediately did whatever voodoo they do to kill their customer.
---
&gt; Bethesda needs to fucking fix that 
---
Good to see that you at least acknowledge the people that actually can fix this issue.
---
&gt;  How in the fuck can you sit there and feel good about basically stealing ? 
---
Yeah... this one, not so much. The situation sucks, agree with you there, but you're not entitled to dick. They didn't steal from you.
---
Events really need to tie their rewards directly to successful completion. Don't complete the event, don't get all the XP and legendaries.
---
Oof, that’s tough, sorry if I took them
---
If I remember it was an old atom shop item from back when the game started.
---
That's a bad CAMP owner. 
---
Shame!
---
Oh, well - luckily the majority of the players out there are golden.
---
yeah. you'd bet? cool.
---
Ah ok, dang, really wanted it lol.
---
Yep. That's probably what the base owner did. 3 vendors were close together and the 4th was off to the side a bit
---
whatever you say brightwolf123
---
It’s not bannable because it doesn’t violate the ToS. And more often than not, it’s not being ‘excused’ by anyone; it’s simply being ‘explained’.
---
Acknowledging that an action isn’t a rules violation isn’t the same as endorsing or supporting the action.
---
Yeah I've been at trap camps before, it's not hard to figure out what they're waiting for
---
It's a design choice. I'm sure it's related to recent exploits involving vendors, scrip machines and vending machines.
---
Are legendary perks even out yet for console bc I can’t find them like I’m lost and I’m lvl 163
---
I have as well.
---
No
---
ACH NOT ME RETIREMENT ATOMS!!!!
---
Submit a ticket.
---
The good ones definitely seem to out weigh the bad ones
---
I don't see a pic
---
I didn't have time to get one, sorry?
---
Yeah.its easy for me to run away pull up my scrap and save my junk.but that wouldn't of even helped you.so 100 a piece stable flux?you bought 60?really sucks
---
I got Berkeley mine is abandoned bog town
---
Thank you, I’ll try doing this!
---
Yeah it think it was a B.E.T.A reward. I personally have it, yet I can’t remember if it was free or I bought it.
---
I cannot because I don't know the password and the website will not send me an email
---
Based on the increments, it looks to me like this month's Fallout 1st installment of Atoms went bananas.
---
Why would they ban something that was legitimately in the game? 🤔
---
If we get this one I can have *even more* crap legendaries sitting in my STASH taking up room while I slowly turn them back into scrip!
---
I was surprised they added one for the gauss pistol. As in, just the gauss pistol. We already got one for just the gauss shotgun from the survivalist NW event a few months ago. Excluding the clandestine set, those are the only gauss skins we have so far. No earnable skin for the gauss minigun yet, and nothing at all for the gauss rifle even though that's been in the game since launch. Really odd decision making on their part to have it so disproportionate and stagger it across such different methods of earning them. One skin limited time from NW only, one from the season, what's the gauss minigun skin gonna be? A .1% plan drop from the next halloween event?
---
Yeah, it's so funny how this game got so many negs and bad reviews when it was released. Game has the strongest community I've ever seen in a game.
---
If they ever become that big of an issue I suspect it would be a nerf into oblivion rather than an outright ban. Then it'll be collectors item only, no more than that.
---
Ie) all theyd have to do is up the lv cap by a decent number, and everything we currently own would be more or less obsolete
---
That's the new fallout 1st reward we were hearing about. 😉
---
A locked door is as secure as no door in this game. I takes 5 key presses to walk through them. You used to be able to stack foundations and this let you block them off with big chunks of concrete but it still won't stop ppl running in while your camp is still loading. Only way to stop ppl buying is to store them.
---
I’d still do it if earle is no longer going underground or above ceiling. It’s just annoying for ‘boss’ to have glitches like this.
---
Lmao aww, the poor child got its feelings hurt. Ill tell your dad to extend his special late-night time with you while everyone else is away so you can get that extra lovin you so desperately crave
---
Okey, I understand why you hate it then. I am honestly more of a pve player. And PvP normally just makes me feel bad cause I don't really like the thought of ruining the game for other players. But this guy actually deserved it for fucking up my ears with his screaming, and following me when I tried to get away from him. He made me feel uncomfortable so I wanted to make him pay with the embarrasment og getting killed by a low lvl character. I woulden't even loot him, I would just let him live with the shame. I know I sound really petty now, but I have had a bad day already so I was just really looking forwrwad to relax a bit with fallout.
---
People also can report it, so it's not like there aren't options.
---
200 a piece. I bought 30 flux total.. hit max caps and figured why not stack up. Yeah it sucks but it happens I guess
---
I just found out someone picked my lock while I was afk lmao
---
Are you saying going to berkly did the bog town one for you? Or that bog town is still glitched for you.
---
So, you forgot your own account password?  That’s very unfortunate.
---
Ytf would you ft and carry that?
---
Edit: Sure, the game has some bugs still and a few exploits (not gonna lie), but it's otherwise the great people I'm there for. This thread owner obviously ended up at the wrong camp.
---
Ooooh so it just happens randomly? Gotcha. Yeah that’s annoying!
---
I appreciate the offer so much seriously but I just now pulled my phone back out to look at Reddit...after buying them all and hopping servers in between. Lmao bad timing on my part I guess
---
They just need to give them the same nerfs all other legendary effects got.
---
Berkley isnt glitched for me but bog town is
---
Yuuuup, got this north of point pleasant. Just kinda rollin’ with it.
---
Don't spend them as you might get in trouble
---
I read your post on bobblehead and magazine displays where they eat into camp's budget, it's very informative. Probably I'll remove them since I'm new and don't have much to display anyway. 🤣
---
You spawn more or less in a random location when fast travelling to player camps. I can and have spawned in locked rooms many times. That's also one way.
---
For normal, no. But its a big problem for ultracite cores
---
I play till the game gives me stress and anxiety because you know it’s broken. Just works. So yea breaks are good keeps you from hating your life and the game lmao
---
It wouldn't be a problem if the website worked and sent me a link to my email
---
I only want the beer stein
---
imo - glass walls are incredible, train table diorama and ship in bottle are also very good additions to camp interior, metall wallpapers and floors are also ok\~ish, lunchboxes are always useful. Subjugator outfit is also...not bad...as it perfectly based on late-USSR military uniform, but without consistency with other cosmetics and camp items - idk, not so desirable. Lvl 100 rewards - just looks like some common bundle on discount from atom shop. Other rewards... lets say - its mostly a useless stuff which noone will ever use.
---
And again we have something star-striped as main thema. Yes, i understand that fallout is about post-nuclear retro-futuristic United States, but if you trying to add something uniq and cool - maybe really stop adding stars and stripes to every 2nd skin in the game (while every 1st are usually nuca-cola themed and every 3rd are raiders/settlers/constructed from trash, and very rarely we have something unique and well designed). We are still lacking enclave-themed cosmetics, for example.
---
Lets hope 3rd season will be BOS themed and will contain something BOS-related and cool.
---
You failed because your team is bad not because of the respawn time
---
Mine just worked. Not sure why you’re doesn’t.
---
Lemme guess, cannibal?
---
I'm missing a few icons that were previously free. :/
---
Dang. I didn't think they'd have season 2 that quick
---
I don't agree with trap camps and won't ever do it.
---
However the legal side of me also argues that what someone does within the confines of their own camp or workshop is their business. Its not ethical to ambush your shoppers, however the game intended for there to be a 'rogue' element. It is the wasteland after all. 
---
Shop with extreme caution-- I do.
---
Had a similar problem with my FO1st not even working. Asked for help here and they downvoted me because I forgot my password and the website won't send me an email to reset it. I made a bum account and asked what's going on. They said there is basically an outage with FO1st because tons of people got free atom. Just don't spend any so you don't get banned and it'll hopefully be fixed soon.
---
You’re getting all the atoms that were supposed to be going to the Fallout 1st players whose  monthly atoms are M.I.A.
---
I'm always loosing water due to disinterest due to always eating uncooked stuff., but that's why I picked up plague Walker, so I never have to be super concerned about curing diseases.
---
Fassacht collectron keeps me stocked with a fine selection of booze to party up with.
---
Try not to die!
---
Have you tried calling Todd's personal cell and telling him you don't hate him like everyone else?
---
We should be able to buy atoms to request bug fixes....... oh how low they've fallen
---
The weirdness happens on Xbox too. 
---
I bought a month of Fallout 1st. 
---
I was charged $12.99 to my card instead of the $25 dollar gift card. 
---
The next day I wake up and I’m missing the $12.99 charge and have now been charged 74.99 and the $25 gift card is gone. 
---
I get it refunded via Microsoft. 
---
I pay for a month again, doesn’t use my gift card. A month passes, I forgot to cancel and it charges me again and this time I don’t get more atoms. 
---
Shits weird.
---
You could take a screenshot, Xbox home button + Y, then upload it, then you can go on the Xbox app and screenshot that (if you want to share it somewhere other than Xbox)...then you have something you can share. That's what I do anyway.
---
I have no idea. It'll send me the one for my username but not password. I made a bum account and am working on trying to get an email. Not sure why I'm being downvoted. Guess it's my fault for making an account years ago and never using it because xbox just auto does everything once it's linked
---
Go into your gallery, open the picture in full screen mode.  Hit your XBox button, then Y to take a screenshot of the full screen shot without overlays/hud/etc.  Then go to:
---
https://gameclips.io/GAMERTAG/screenshots
---
[Like this](https://gameclips.io/Ruleryak/screenshots) and you can snag your shots on PC.  Thanks Bethesda!
---
I made an attempt at a fun scary walk thru camp and I'm taking notes of what not to do, I want people to walk thru my camp for the experience. I do not have traps and have a stash by the door and a sign that clearly says vendor on top floor. These types of camps keep people from walking thru the fun things people take lots of time and caps/atoms to create
---
No, we had earle down to just a small bar of health but with all the meat piles the game started lagging like hell edit: reddit moment, downvoted for simply explaining what happened during the event
---
the game does not actually load every camp, it only loads the ones in the cell that you are in, that's what makes it so that when you travel to a camp to buy or something you usually can see the camp pop into existence, because as far as the game on your end was concerned the camp was not there until you traveled to it, i don't think it would be possible to affect the server stability by building a camp, the world loads just fine and that has a lot more things in it, but having to render one million lights would most likely give your gpu a heart attack.
---
Nice it was at 60 mill yesterday
---
I would not spend it all but only spend at a normal pace so it raises no flags Only if Beth ignores you. You have a paper trail so id say ur good in case Beth wants to punish or what not
---
Open the photo gallery from the game and make the photo fullscreen, then have xbox do a screenshot upload it to xbox live and use the xbox app on your phone to save/share the photo
---
Even the initiate? It's legacy but some people still have it laying around.
---
Some games have a cooldown  period to purchase stuff where no further progress can otherwise be made. 
---
Others just mail them to you, but that ain't gonna happen with 76.
---
Somehow I think bethesda may pay attention to this bug
---
Don't worry they will bring you back with more atomic shop point purchases and legendary runs with the last pieces of the board being a black or white telle tubby skin for your power armor or power rangers red for your xo1 from the atom shop to use doing the queen.
---
But they will for sure get you to stay with a ghillie suit power armor skin.. I know for sure 👍
---
To match every single piece of none power armor akin
---
Wood
---
I have one too and my GOD it's a beast. Take some toxic goo with adrenal reaction down to about 40 hp and I can do massive damage and also never die. Only thing that I would trade it for would be a bundled VE Ultracite GL and a VE laser rifle. Since lvl 20 I started getting into GLs with PA, and one day i found a V33 UGL. Even at lvl 45, I knew where I was destined to go.
---
Come up with whatever makes you feel better but honestly 99.9% of the time the team i’m with completes the event in about 5-10mins.
---
They should add perk coins as a reward for completing the legendary run.  
---
To be clear,  it would be nice if we could get 1 coin per 100,000 exp after completing the legendary run.
---
Why wood?
---
When I started on xbox, I was really into role playing. All my characters had names and backstories. I let rng decide my roles for me. Then I got laid off for covid and started playing on pc. I immediately built meta characters (commando and tank), although they sort have a head canon going on. Since I've been back at work, I've been trying to come up with more wacky and fun role playing ideas. First, I rebuilt one of my xbox characters, which isn't so much wacky, but still quite fun. I created Grammy 2.0, aka Wynona the crackhead cowgirl. She isn't done, but I wanted to get my next character started and up to level 50. His name is timmy, but I'm not sure if I'm going with greased up naked deaf guy, or sicilian chameleon stealth assassin. For the time being, he's a smartass; a mule with high intelligence.  I work overnight, and weekends after usually boring with everything closed, and everyone is asleep; but I change shifts this week, so that might change the way I play.
---
Gat plas
---
Nice one! Congrats 👏
---
I'm curious as to how you can waste stimpaks at that level?
---
Hah, that's a good one. I want to make a Junkies Raider at some point, sounds like a lot of fun.
---
You could get the xbox app for your phone (I use an android  unsure if apple have it) Then view your screenshot, save to phone, post to reddit.
---
Cooking is such a chore on console because it takes so long. I watched a PC streamer do it in like .5sec and I was very triggered lol.
---
I would say no however we did see them revert the radical mask because it wasn't intended to have a legendary effect. I don't think a ban of legacy's is feasible, however I could see them removing the no longer existing effects if they cannot find fixes for the amount of lag these weapons can generate. I say this while being an owner of a JE Gat Plasma and while I would be very dissapointed, I could see them doing this.
---
Good thing it's in beta so they can remove it citing incompatibility issues! 
---
/s
---
I think it’s more likely that in group content we see mechanics that stop them from being viable. 
---
If we look at SBQ as the first main group content it’s basically the wild west; the whole server could be there, standing anywhere, using/doing anything. We move to ACP and we see a dramatic increase in difficulty as well as limiting amount of people and adding additional mechanics. And the most recent (PTS) addition of Daily Ops; specific mechanics aimed at limiting stealth users, rotating changes to force people to play slightly differently , and specific objectives for people to play around. 
---
All it’ll take is to continue to keep all these iterations and add ‘enemies immune to explosions’ or something similar and all of a sudden everyone’s on an even playing field. Legacy weapon owners will still be upset and threaten to quit and what not but they’ll still be able to one shot most everything outside of these fun end game activities
---
I’ve been saying something similar for weeks. I’d be fine with the slider, but what I’d really like Beth to do is base the ammo converter interface on the Load Baring token exchanger. You open the UI and on the screen you see something like: 1178 10mm rounds detected, would you like to trade 1175 rounds for x ammo points? After I typed that out I see the slider would be better. Let’s have that.
---
I find that doing a quick melee before it can finish reloading stops it and allows me to finish out the core.
---
They don't cause lag though.  Only Tesla's do.
---
I just carry Ionized Meat. No cooking and doesn't spoil. Weighs less too.
---
If they didn't drop the trap on your head (which should be banabke), would say that's a good reason to keep scrap kits in hand.
---
Otherwise trapping and looting folks is one of many important themes to the game being set in a post apocalypse and all.
---
I've been had a couple times myself, bot this bad but was a fair learning experience. 
---
Tho does make people super freaked about my smokey dark hallway in my Silent Hill experience camp, in which there are no actual traps.
---
Rip. Thats quite a harsh community response but thank you for some imput on this, i couldn't find info anywhere and unless i can talk to someone i fear I'll never know my password again lol. If people get banned over it that would suck.. its not like they purposely triggered an exploit and went ballistic on the previous years worth of atomic shop items ya know however it would be fair if bethesda took this one to the chin, me for example didn't do anything and i feel punished already without my scrapbox
---
I like this idea too. I also seen a suggestion that instead of hiding missiles in our inventory, maybe Beth could give ammo  points  as a event rewards.
---
Steel
---
Is it the 76 Trucker cap? It's an atomic shop item that will probably be back at some point like they usually do.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_76_trucker_cap
---
They specifically state they'd like to focus on repeatable content. They're honest about their goals for the game which is to increase grind. Hopefully in more creative and fun ways, though.
---
It's called Vault 76 Cap, was one of my first atom shop purchases.
---
Untrue, my Gat Plasma on Xbox can cause lag spikes if fired continously on a boss such as SBQ or Wendigo Colossus. Especially if there is more then one there. Although this could be said about any explosive weapon, the Gat Plasma's bullet split shooting out like 12 explosive rounds at once at a high fire rate definitely can't help the situation.
---
So mine doesn't seem to be working...meaning I got the plan but in the menu it's still locked...did I get some other colossus wendigo head mount?
---
Seems worth a try lol *shines shoes* "please don't drop the hammer on me too sire"
---
Yeah exactly that one, thanks.
---
And that's the problem. He was doing that shit to try and force you to PvP. Ppl do this all the time and then whip out some hacked weapon kill you and level your base. For the record I don't hate PvP but the way it works here doesn't work, it just creates griefers.
---
Bro what platform are you on ?
---
Well that’s poopy. ): I hope it gets fixed.
---
I... don’t know. You did learn the plan, right?
---
It also isn’t in the same place as all the other mounted heads.
---
You get it with almost every single weapon you scrap.
---
Look under 'Developer Ineptitude'.
---
There's heaps of sub categories in there though.
---
Ah, that would do it
---
I haven't experienced any lag from my gatling plasma.  Maybe it's a console thing, I heard other problems with lag that seem to disproportionately affect console.
---
It should initiate PvP so you can burn their shitty base to the ground 😎
---
Cooking has never been an issue. Cooking process with xp buffs running is like easy money. After running uranium fever and other heavy meat events it makes a difference (so long as you have enough wood).
---
Second the cooked meat sells for more at the vendor.
---
The game has a lot of barriers between you and your goals. I remember a quote from one of the lead dev members saying something In the area of they wanted a survival game and you to have some basic survivor chores but brushing your teeth was going too far. 
---
I still believe a "survival mode" would make a difference. It could be a switch of sorts. Go into a world with it on or off. If it's on maybe grant better xp, legendaries, etc. It would be similar to going into the old survival servers that once existed but could keep everyone together and just playing at a different difficulty.
---
Personally I liked survival servers but they had some issues. I don't think survival should automatically be PvP. Yes it should exist but survival should just create some more barriers between you and your goals but should gift you for those challenges.
---
Really? I did not know that. I was planning on trying to horde all the code pieces then returning. That does suck.
---
Sounds awesome! What do you play on? I'd love to see it
---
At least someone understands what I mean. Lmao
---
I want that hat in real life. I've looked around online but haven't found one.
---
"I'm but a peasant boy sire plz"
---
They’d ban it the same way they nerfed the legendary mask; which legitimately everybody could have had
---
As someone told me before, they’re is a MASSIVE influx of bots aimed at downvoting.
---
):
---
... And Carnivore mutation.  If it's not a Scorchbeast, robot or cryptid: it's a meal.
---
Happened to me once but still gave me the end event loot
---
Console's aren't as powerful as PC's. Depending on what you have, it can handle the amount of effects happening better. Even my Xbox One X pretty much shits the bed if 2 or more people start using explosive legacies, not enough to be unplayable, but definitely noticeable.
---
Bethesda had time to follow up w a survey about their service before steam could acknowledge a ticket lmao pls kill me
---
Ive not seen that in 76... the wiki article looks like it's from maybe Fallout4?
---
Yeah I might miss the new armor bench if they don't fix it soon. And I'm just going to start it up once a day. If it's not fixed I'm just going to wait it out and keep checking every day. If it's not fixed by the new legendary run I'll just cancel it at this point.
---
Re-enable everything that was stealth removed or removed without reason. Explosive radium rifles, bottlecap mines, gilded miniguns/.44s, paddle ball mods, etc. Also just enable all the unreleased stuff like the black knight because there's already a fuckton of hacked ones in circulation anyway so may as well let people have it
---
I've been kinda seeing the same thing. I've been booted from more than one server for being one of the last people on it.
---
No luck tonight, for any of us
---
Yes, read the plan...it's gone now out of my notes inventory. And found it near the gorilla statues...but it's locked. I'm going to log out and re-log in to see what happens....
---
Happened to me, thought I was going crazy for a minute
---
&gt; The undoubted income generated I'd then feed back into fixing the game up, actually lovingly restoring it rather than throwing out the next buggy bauble on top of the last one.
---
Short term increase, long-term it would result in losses over what they are currently generating. There's a reason so many companies are doing this with microtransactions, it's not just for shits and giggles
---
Congrats! I literally just got mine too just now!! Lol. Feels nice to finally complete the paints...I don’t want to see another piece of Technical Data!! 😅
---
Best of luck.
---
Youre an idiot.
---
Yeah for something with '34' as its number I was expecting more.
---
PC
---
Bah! I have a fallout 76 cap for real, along with a T-51 power helmet, fallout 4 pip boy, quantum nuka cola lamp, vault boy controller holder, framed map of Appalachia and a shitload of fallout pops.
---
 The Scabber backpack is understated yet elegant.
---
The sub catagories are what fuck me up. I think that I am going the right way to report it and then it funnels it into a very specific problem. I just wanna be sure the issue is seen by the right people lol
---
Come back when you try to beat acp while getting 3-4 frames per second from the game shitting itself trying to keep up with all the meatpiles spawning in
---
u/Valseek  can you tell me where to report this so that it is seen by the correct people?
---
That new globe used to be free. I had it at one point and never paid for it. I was wondering why I couldn't find it anymore.
---
There are some really cool things like the train set, the shooting gallery, the brotherhood version of the communist bunker and a few other things but I gotta say I feel like the first season had some better rewards as far as cosmetics go.
---
Theres a few laying around next to the deathclaw on deathclaw island, one in the boat, another couple in the little camp area next to the boat, check both areas next to the deathclaw.
---
My girl rocks the brown nurses outfit with plague doctor mask to keep themed to my silent hill experience camp.
---
Needs a better backpack skin tho.
---
Want a bloodied faster swing speed cultists dagger so bad to complete the look.
---
Thank you for the heads-up.  nukacrypt was correct for my solo launch of Alpha and of Charlie, tonite.  They musta updated them.
---
Glad i didnt burn off cards using bad codes!
---
I dropped love on colossal problem and then on morgantown.  
---
It was insanely funny when a squeaky pre-pubescent voice ran by me into my morgantown nuke...”how do we get to colossal from here?”
---
“Someone missed the mine...  how could they miss the mine?   Are they stupid?”
---
I farm glowing ones in morgantown....  too bad kid. It was my nuke and it went EXACTLY where i targeted it...  LOL
---
Thank you for raising the alarm and explaining the launch process in its intended form
---
I heard it was asbestos, no? I also recall the post. People said you can stand on the fire pools with it. Going to have to try myself
---
Asbestos lining.
---
I had same thing happen to me, I don’t want to get banned for something I didn’t do.
---
I do believe this is facts
---
How legendary items get ID is not unique each and every items has its own ID which explains how the last dupe kinda ran rampant.. when a player buys the dupe item the dupe has an different **new** ID then the original.. how bethesda tracks dupes is by possibly checking accounts for multiples of each item.
---
But then bethesda has shown adding a unique ID for items is too complicated with their engine since an innocent person may buy an dupe item without knowing it was an dupe and have it randomly deleted  cause they unknowingly bought it
---
I had no idea what a legacy weapon was before this. I feel very blesséd now
---
I agree. The greenhouse and the b.o.s field station are probably the best things. I feel like the first season had a lot more to offer. THAT BEING SAID we are going to have some actual story dlc content on top of it as well so that could be their reason for not having it as much of a focus.
---
I found out you can server hop Huntersville, and there's about 15-20 mines you can disarm that do respawn. I do appreciate the help though! Also happy cake day!
---
You subbed through steam?
---
Before you get upset about that, keep in mind that the 80 was a lazy copy/paste from fallout 4 to begin with. +50% is the intended drum mag capacity for every other gun in the game. If you want to just raise the capacity, at least do it for every weapon, not just pretending that one of them is different
---
Thats why I love all the posts that describe in detail (with plenty of in game evidence) why fo76 is not "real" :)
---
It's implied we're in a simulation
---
Lead ~11k, Wood ~23k, Steel ~12k.
---
They are aware and they're evidently looking into it.  
---
Your best bet is probably along the lines of "I want a refund" but then in the body explain what the issue is.
---
But you're a First player, right?
---
It’s goods you know you did not pay for. The most they’d probably do is close your account, there’s a chance they’d have a legal case if they were nuts enough to pursue you for the value of the currency.
---
pneumatic is quite useful for wendigo spawn!
---
Is it awarding atoms over again? I've seen people reporting tons of atoms from the sky and now I wonder if it's related to this bug.
---
Ah. I thought 1st as in new player. But before I upgraded it was lead. Lol
---
I’m glad you’ve done such a thorough and carefully constructed study of the entire fallout 76 player base. That must have taken hours. What was your methodology?
---
Ok, thank you!!
---
If canceling first opens the door to the legendary run that would be the play once the 8th hits cause right now its loading like the shop and everything too but i would expect its because you can purchase tiers with atoms.. you would think it'd get fixed just as fast as the item sharing bug because this is costing them their precious micro transactions so it might be fast
---
Especially not if people are rocking both bosses on the same nuke.
---
And this is one of the many reasons why the damage nerf is happening
---
If you have multiple weapons of the same type [eg two handmade of different legendaries] one gets removed or even swap place with another in your hot wheel, heck a weapon that wasn't favorited at all may even take its place!
---
here's hoping :-)
---
I have absolutely experienced tesla users in the event. Don’t take things so personally. Your team simply wasn’t doing enough damage if the event got that close to the end without killing him. The 60 second respawn timer is not whats to blame. Death needs to have some sort of consequence or the events have absolutely zero challenge.
---
I love my blinged out lever action skin :D
---
Wish I had some for others, but too many atoms :(
---
50 Perk Coins aren’t gonna do shit though. Should be every level over 50 grants 1 perk coin in addition to this
---
JuiceHead used my pic in his most recent video :D
---
Edit: somehow my comment multiplied by 4 lol sorry all.
---
Not having a unique ID for high value items is a design decision, and frankly a stupid one.  It's a choice, not something inherent to a game of this type.  If items do have unique IDs and a copy can be created that does not reference the original base ID, that is also a design error or a coding error, and should be rectified.
---
Even without unique IDs however, you could still log the movement of items with high reliability.  Dumping a hash of the properties of a legendary into a log as it moved around would allow you to track the movement of that item with a high degree of accuracy.  Party A on server X received an item with a particular hash at a particular time...OK, on server X around that time, what parties transferred out an item with that same hash.  Follow the chain.
---
Should be a broken and pristine version of every build type.
---
Or at least make blood splatters and tears /holes in walls be like stickers we  can place about as we please.
---
Happened to me, I’m not even sure if I’m reporting it right, I’m not getting an email saying I submitted anything
---
Oh nice! good to know.
---
And thanks! I didn't even see that it was cake day for me! :D
---
You had em down, but also died like 5 or 6 times. It happens. Just try to build a better stronger team or collect better weaponry. If you can find a magic minigun you can take em down no problem In half the time allotted, just make sure you have the ammo.
---
Yes plz, more plushie = more happy
---
Also the blood Eagle skin is still broken!
---
Yes!!!!
---
Yup I made another lost about it and the gold handmade skin
---
Lighten up Francis
---
I would like the option to have an anti-aircraft gun in my camp to keep those jerks out of our Appalachia.
---
You are done. It disappears when you logout.
---
I have noticed when I play that the same people are in the lobby each time I play in succession. Maybe a handful of new folks, but plenty of folks from the previous match. I get teamed with people I've killed, or more likely, killed me. I get teamed with the same people I played with last session. Granted I play at weird times, but yes, it feels like you're waiting for the one and only match to end before the next one starts.
---
just need elder for my BoS alt myself, you kinda got to love how great the whitespring bunker is for farming that, like you're literally stealing technology from the Enclave for the brotherhood which is so BoS.
---
This was the exact complaint I had. Why are we the commies if we are from Appalachia?
---
It's not a problem unless you have a big CAMP, but if you start nearing your budget, get rid of displays like that and you'll free up a LOT of budget.
---
To me it's a total wash tbh, much like guilie in this season, glad someone likes it tho :)
---
Best bet is to store them because even if you have them inside a room with no windows or doors and they're unpowered so the icon isnt even on the map there's still a way to buy from them.
---
If they're stored or empty that's the only ways to totally stop purchases.
---
Mine's not working right now either
---
Use asbestos lining and dance in the falling embers
---
That’s what I’m rolling with for now, I think it matches pretty well because the starlet sniper outfit has skulls on it as well
---
You can do it now, use Unyielding armor my lowest SPECIAL is 19
---
No they aren’t listening.  This system forces people to make multiple toons for each build or significantly increase the grind for legendary perks.
---
If they were listening they would drop the whole system involving coins entirely.
---
All the bad things you described happen, but are by no means the norm. I see people working together to complete events and goals far more often than I see them trying to take advantage of each other.
---
This is why I don't buy junk from vendors. Much safer to message someone and buy it at a public place like a train station
---
Dear Todd,
---
        You give me free shit because we're best friends eh? You understand my wallet is anorexic and just shoots my money at cashiers when i go places so you help me out right? And then you tear me down, ruin our friendship and take your gifts away.. why do you do this? Why do you hate me Todd? I've been loyal to the franchise.. but i get it.. its cool..
---
                                                          Sincerely,
---
                                                                    NukaGuy
---
*Cries in braille*
---
I'm more of a mongrel per se...
---
Not like that, I mean physically having all stats at 15 without boosts.
---
&gt;*too complicated for them*
---
Their game is broken why would they add in more coding to find certain legendaries? Their way of winning the battle find multiples of items on an account. **BAN** even then they gave people's accounts back chock full of goodies.. how they judge on who gets their account back, account wiped, or banned who knows
---
I get mobs stuck all the time. It makes for awesome photo ops :D
---
And I'm OK with that. I don't mind grinding if I can see myself making tangible progress to an interesting reward. I find I'll even end up doing pretty mindless/boring tasks as long as the reward is interesting enough, although I'd definitely prefer if some of those repeatable were more interesting than my 10000th west tek run or 300th Line in the Sand lol
---
so no rewards for doing it ?
---
Nicer would be abandoning the system altogether for one that doesn’t push singular builds for each toon.   It is a really stupid system.
---
i agree the greenhouse is cool, gona have to make a third character because i'm not tearing down my main's camp and it does not fit the theme of my second character but man oh man do i have a build boner for that set :p
---
Ah okay, so I did remember wrong. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Forward and CC to me too. I'm doing a research... Paper. For MIT.
---
do you have a bounty on you?
---
Thanks for proving my point with your excuse
---
I have a pioneer scout paint on my lever action. I got it off the shop. I think it came out a week after the tadpole missions started.
---
Ps4. It's a work in progress, hoping they bring the smoke machine back.
---
Its so nice the event doesn't end until you can be safely out of the mine, I also really appreciate the wendigo spawns not giving me sludge lung or any disease for that matter
---
This. Entirely this.
---
I will aggressively defend workshops if I am still present, I will aggressively pursue opponents at workshops if contested, and I will do everything in my power to erase a wanted level.
---
Vendors are not PvP.  Trap camps are just a way for me to get a wanted level spamming grenades.
---
I laughed probably way too damn hard about telly tubby skins for your PA. It better have a tv on the torso or I'm going to complain on reddit for sure.  Honestly, I feel so much like this about the armor paints.  #1 even with all the PA types you can only use one paint at a time really and I wear costumes making regular armor paint pointless.  Why do they have so many armor paints!?
---
Share the wealth
---
Imo it should just autoclaim on your primary character what you haven't claimed before the reset. At least that way nobody loses anything.
---
That’s an excellent point I hadn’t thought of.
---
Check your settings, in my experience the setting that lets you see other players names will just turn itself off sometimes
---
Yeah I was wondering that that too. The armor ace weapon skins do showcase a player with the outfit though so hopefully we’ll get it as a free atom shop item or something.
---
The picture I was talking about: 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/WyzSCNG
---
This is a poor compromise.  They should abandon the perk coin system entirely.  It forces people toward classes/singular builds and punishes those that do not do this.  It is against the general spirit of Fallout and shows they are only listening to some players.
---
I will play this game much less once this is introduced.
---
compound interest
---
I'd still like to find them in the wild so i can finish all those super old achievements :( It's a shame vendor buying them doesn't count as "collecting" them :/
---
Was thinking this exactly.
---
Would also like to see a daily and/or weekly for perk coins.
---
I would think the spin up time on the gat would make it kinda worthless. But if you have the element of surprise I guess that doesn't matter. Unless you blow it and expose yourself too early. Dunno, something to think about.
---
Oh hell yeah, it looks like a NATO rifle now! (Can’t tell if M16, G3, or L1)
---
There were lots of armor skins, but I'd love outfits especially since lots of players have secret service armor that we wear clothes over. There is a ss armor skin. I'm just not very excited about any of this season. The only thing I was excited by was the green house building kit but that was at the very end of the season.
---
You're silly. They can't charge you for a glitch.
---
^rng
---
I don't remember. I think you get the gun. I don't bother reading the note anymore.
---
Yeah that's never going to happen in 76
---
I hate the entire idea of scrapping perks.  It forces people towards specific builds and very much goes against previous Fallouts in that sense.  Fifty or five  more coins makes no difference here.  I dislike the entire idea and think they should allocate points purely based on levels and not punish people for altering builds _as they are still doing here_.
---
Just shot 100 rounds at my feet armor didn’t budge. I measured on my 12’ screen.
---
50? I have a 40 million mounted head plans stuffed inside my stash.
---
Adding logging should not be viewed as a complication.  It pays dividends far beyond the low complexity it adds.  The reality is that the developers and maintainers of a system without proper logging are largely flying blind, and will pay a far larger cost to maintain and debug such a system, and in many cases will not even be able to resolve issues as they will have no record of what went wrong.
---
However, I don't doubt that the team that develops this game views such a prospect as complicated.
---
I destroy people with the Gat Plas but then again I am a full health Junkies.
---
Well technically everyone will get more powerful for nothing.  Picking a Legendary Perk is free as long as you have a slot open for it - switching what's in that slot or ranking up said Legendary Perk is what costs Perk Coins.
---
Plasma is way better.i have a anti armor explosive laser rifle as well and it's nice for far away accurate shots but the plasma melts everything just be carful w splash damage
---
People only need them for that quest? 🤔 No wonder why I keep selling out on those(500caps)
---
What makes you say that?
---
Yeah I agree even if they had to make it where finding 3*s harder it would be better than everytime I kill a 3* i get a 1* pickaxe
---
I think one of the point of having builds in this game is the choice of where to locate your SPECIAL points. This creates more unique opportunities than even stats.
---
I thought the badge was to craft them?
---
They could scrap the whole system and merely allocate points based on levels.  That would not punish you for respeccing in the past AND it would mean they don’t have to worry about lost cards. 
---
This “compromise” sucks.
---
It was steel, but now they're all kind of hovering around 2-300 except for bone shards and a couple others I can't remember. And I don't have enough space. Ever. Can't sell legendaries to newbs because I have no space. Plus people don't visit often for some reason. Guess I smell funny or something. Sorry, sidetracked.
---
A raider gatling gun??
---
I still craft my meat with Super Duper equipped for that chance of extra stuff to sell to a vendor.  More caps pls.
---
Also anyone else find it strange that raw meat restores more hunger than cooked meat?
---
Happens often with my miniguns, haven't been able to reliably reproduce it though.
---
Run in. Shoot stuff. Try not to die, Make sure to hit the boss, and as soon as it's dead make a beeline for the body to loot it for a legendary item. don't worry about escaping the mine at the end. Get a few cool plans out of doing it several times as an event reward.
---
For those who dont know, if there's already a nuke on the mine you can just nuke fissure and both ACP and Scorched Earth will happen
---
We are complaining because the method they choose to make people advance, namely getting rid of perks, is a shitty idea.  A far easier one that would require less management would be to simply allocate points based on levels with no scrapping required.
---
That sounds like it could have been cool. But it really sounds broken. What else is new I guess.
---
Easily would be Screws or Springs. 
---
I try to keep Aluminum, Screws, Springs and Adhesive at the highest possible before I have to start selling.
---
Yeah I was 80% done soloing site alpha when this guy my level comes along and turns on game chat “ hey I have everything I need to nuke I have to do the colossus you can come if you want” so he launches doesn’t have a team ends up being worst colossus fight I’ve ever seen.
---
It also limits you in what you can do. If I want to utilize PA and normal armor I would have to be some kind of hybrid that is inevitably weaker than specing into one or the other individually. It limits freedom and for me is an aspect that takes some of the fun away.
---
I had the same problem for a while, but I dumped all my ammo and I dropped a few hundred. I sell or scrip nearly everything I get, so I have a constant weight of about 678-760.
---
It took them awhile to rectify for me. This last time they have yet to respond at all and it's been a bit of time. Ive been very patient since beta with this game and have enjoyed it deeply but this is sort of troubling. Atom store stuff comes and goes and if I don't know what I have atom wise accounting wise what am I to do? Will I get banned for spending what I have? It's really effed.
---
Yeah me too. 600 screws atm, almost 700 springs and only 50 aluminum.
---
Sure did
---
&gt;Y dis stuff get nu ban 
---
On the other hand bethesda made a showcase featuring trap camps they did nerf them to an extent so people with stacked punji boards are legacy traps 
---
Also why do they also have radiation emitters as an camp item? 🤔
---
yeah i thought it would of been some cool quest but i really do think its broken, there just seems like therr should be more to it then just fetching a gun for me to hold in my inventory lol, and no reward for what ive done so far so its wierd it just ended like that
---
I ran a solo earlier and dropped the nuke but as soon as I got to the event, I got disconnected... haven’t played all day since then haha.
---
This is always the answer 
---
#BURN IT TO THE GROUND
---
Lmfao dumbass, stash your flux.
---
Best you could do is 13 in 6 stats and 8 in one.
---
All 8 base, then grind out 6 SPECIAL boosting perk cards to max rank for +5.
---
Check your displays as well, just in case. The only time that happened to me, my game crashed and then afterwards both vendors and display items were put back in the stash.
---
If in PA use GP if in combat type armor use laser up close and personal both great but at distance the gatling plasma kinda sucks I use a AAE minigun and if I can get distance on people who have the gatling plasma I win everytime it just sucks like that but if throw a jet pack on your power armor you can make all your engagements close range and won't have to worry about its shitty range but in the end it's up to you
---
It's within game mechanics. Some of us are raiders, dude.
---
Spears...
---
I have three... How many are there?
---
It is an RPG, you must choose your way of playing, it is a bad thing about Fallout 4 that you could be all powerful there, and in Fallout 76 you are just another Dweller
---
Unfortunately I think it was and still is Bethesda’s intent that individual player characters have their own unqiue SPECIAL stats so the other characters you create can feel different. Hopefully perk loadouts will help change this somewhat.
---
Yeah but most other games micro transactions actually work. Pointing fingers at backwoods camper (soft walls that other items melt into) and communist bunker (items float off the floors... Looks utterly shit). 
---
If you don't own a combat Rifle or handmade you don't get new skins either. 
---
I support and love the game. I definitely do. I have eroded confidence in the quality of atom content. That's my miracle fix- make it better and in turn more lucrative. 
---
It's a fantasy land 'just imagine' post. In reality there's attention needed across the board.
---
If I ever have enough time to max all the special legendary perks, I may do this and just leave luck at 8 like it is now.
---
Even If you get to support it's [broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/im5foz/problems_with_bugthesda_fo_1st_and_atom_glitch/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I actually don't like the idea of swapping levels for it either, but since we're on iteration 3 or 4 now and they've kept that the same core concept I think it's fair to say they're not budging on it. Whether or not it bothers you enough to not play anymore is up to you, but no one is forcing you to take the legendary perks.
---
Its to use 3 not craft
---
I'd be a lot more okay with the current incarnation of the machine if they'd kept the one good thing about the original version: conversion options you lack the ammo to make did not appear. You needed at least 3 missiles, for example, for missiles to show up as an option to convert. Why they changed that, I cannot fathom.
---
76 trucker cap was a exclusive if you did the BETA
---
Edit: I dont remember paying for mine, it just showed up in the stash one day
---
Ok, I'll try the demo.
---
The most important scrap I try to keep between 400-600 and then I’ll start selling. 90% of my stash is junk haha but I feel like the inventory management is part of the end game. If I had Fo1st then you can just grab everything in sight bc its unlimited storage. Kind of defeats the point of scavenging ya know?
---
but wait, what if what they mean is that they don't have budget for A collectron :p
---
That's cool.
---
Man, I hope we get new plantable crops though some day. Some stuff I'm just too lazy to farm.
---
But daddy needs make enough psycho so he can inject fury and psychobuff directly into his eyeballs so it's a vicious cycle.
---
Any sort of rationalizing that you are just another vault dweller goes out the door with bloodied builds. By that logic, every vault dweller should be able to 1 shot the SBQ but that isn't the reality. Maxing all 15 stats could not be as bad as that. I didn't see it as a bad thing in FO4 as it gave me a sense of progression, like I was always getting better and stronger. In F76 once I hit T-65 PA and got a JE gat plasma there just isn't anywhere left to go or things to experiment on because I don't have that choice.
---
How much you wanna bet the red viper one is also gonna have that bug? Considering it looks pretty much identical to the blood eagle one anyway
---
A glitch that made him fly around at light speed would be the cherry on top.
---
Ok I wasn't sure. 🤷‍♀️
---
Apparently it’s a bug and it’s the tropic thunder handmade skin(camo version of the screaming eagle)
---
It makes me sad they they aren’t listening.  It makes me similarly sad that that many seem to think they are listening.
---
It’s a welcome addition, but still feels like bandaids on broken system. I used to respec points in adventure/ NW constantly bc pre wastelanders there was such a content drought. There was nothing to do but try new builds/weapons. Trading in cards completely limits our range of what we can do. I’m penalized for trying new weapons and builds to go with them, often times  the new weapons are the most lasting thing from “dlc”. 
---
In Wastelanders we got 2 heavy weapons and a shotgun. The next BoS dlc will have 2 melee and one seemingly bad rifle. Outside of a few days of campaign dlc and maybe a gold grind for armor, If you feel inclined to use these weapons and change your build, you have to chew into your points, cards, and time. However this time it’ll be even harder bc you could have half the cards or less left from legendary perks. Those legendary perks could also be a huge investment if they’re weapon specific. You also can’t implore ppl to keep trying NW if they’re locked into the same special points from adventure. 
---
Leveling up should equal legendary points flat out. Unlocking regular cards to max should allow u to at any moment pick any star level of said card. Then u get a full library of perks rather than a repetitive list of the same card, a 1, a 2, a holographic 1, etc etc, it’s cumbersome and dumb. Legendary perks should operate in a similar fashion. The ability to refund those points would be nice too. Spending 350 points to fully rank up a legendary card is still a huuuge investment. When these perk cards often change, get bugged, and bounce around in effectiveness, it’s hard to know when you’re wasting you’re rather large investments.
---
Hey, there's hope.
---
They're adding stuff like the ammo converter and chicken coop to gold bullion vendors.
---
We're floating in space forever just..... Why.....?
---
What does it matter when most everyone is just going to gravitate to the strongest build. I just don't see the point in limitkng it for uniqueness when a lot of the playerbase is the exact same thing. People would still play how they want even if they could max them all out, except there would be no limitations.
---
Lead and Steel at 200, plastic 200-250. Most things at 100 and some at 50. 
---
Low numbers mean some free space and also (and fundamentally) give me a reason to keep playing and scavenging. 
---
When I have a full stash I just craft guns and armor to learn mods, and make ammo. The rest is sold.
---
There are legendary perk cards coming. There’s one for each SPECIAL that allows you to boost that individual SPECIAL +5 when fully ranked and max 15.
---
&gt;complicated
---
With how certian bugs are still in game why would they even bother adding in ID tags, adding in more broken stuff to an already broken game, and new updates secretly break stuff(which caused dupemas) along with countless other bugs.. they find the cheapest way to patch bugs
---
I beleive their are 7
---
Initiate (legacy)
---
Knight 
---
Sergeant
---
Captain
---
Officer
---
Paladin 
---
Elder
---
RIGHT?! someone said that commies have the most atom store items than any other group, oh well...
---
Exactly my thoughts. Plus, First kinda feels like cheating to me.
---
Don't know what it is but Bethesda can't seem to get enough of communism themed items lately.
---
Raider and trapper armor still have no skins either.
---
 They changed the perk system so everyone can't have everything why change it so that everybody is OP?
---
I like my heavy combat armor. I think it looks pretty good as well.
---
Bloodied build here. I use radiation emitters if my health gets Hugh at my camp so I don’t have to waste glowing meat. Or gamma ammo.
---
I’m also not a trap camp douche.
---
Pretty hard-core though, Nice.
---
Did you do the main quest for wastelanders?
---
Unless they make the super sledge look like a giant dildo, tho only that thing I want is the ability to wear a traffic cone as a hat. You could even make it a rare spawn. You take a nukashine and have a random chance of waking up naked in the middle of nowhere wearing a traffic cone on your head, just like real life.
---
What system are you on?
---
oh nice find! wish it would be free, but doubt it. guess it will have an 800 atom price tag on it...bleh
---
Hey wait, are you dirty mike and the boys.
---
So if there was a previously launched nuke for ACP and then you nuke SBQ after the event, it will spawn it again?
---
yeah i hear ya, it not a very exciting season to be honest. i don't use pa and not a fan of commies...meh. maybe season 3...haha
---
There's about 4 things I'm interested in. Have a love/hate with the whole concept.
---
Make personal uses out it that's great
---
While on the other hand from a **raiders** perspective they come in handy for trap bases next to punji boards 
---
It's honestly fun going through trap bases
---
I found a weird bug with my atoms yesterday where it didn’t charge me to rank up 3 spots and then I went to the atomic shop to click on something so it would refresh my atoms and it let me buy a bunch of stuff. Immediately reported it. I was like oh great with my luck bethesda will ban me when I didn’t think I was actually purchasing something.
---
"...I'm not saying we're a completely fucked up bunch, but....
---
...we're a completely fucked up bunch...."
---
I've killed enough enemies to realise that a chance of a 3\* legendary dropping a 3\* item is just as likely as dropping 1\* or 2\* (aka, they all have 33.33% chance happening).
---
And to add on top of that, when comparing the possible rolls a 3\* legendary enemy can drop, there is 114,210 possible combinations. This is when factoring in any possible and valid roll, not including the plans required (such as The Fixer, Bear Arm, etc).
---
Yes, as long as there's an active nuke on monongah mine any nuke after will cause ACP to start. You can even do ACP and if you deal enough damage you can do queen afterwards
---
Commithesda?
---
Turn the grass WAY down, turn water quality down a few notches, turn shadow quality way down, there's a few other tweaks you can do.
---
Here's a decent guide of what all the settings can do for you:
---
[https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-graphics-settings/](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-graphics-settings/)
---
This might still work: https://youtu.be/3NtgLU37TeQ
---
I am referring to the fact of creating your deck of cards for your style of play, something similar to when in Pokémon you choose your team of 6 Pokémon, you cannot carry all types, you have to have resistances and weaknesses
---
If you hate the game so much, why are you here? Go find something that brings you joy instead of being miserable
---
I’m so done if my rifleman is still nerfed. We were never a contender for DPS but now it’s an unplayable build.
---
Not planning to turn my nose up at a fairly simple to get eight treasury notes anytime soon.
---
Oh god, Fallout has the Underdark now.
---
most mmos don’t even allow such drastic build changes and are class locked
---
Wish cannibal was affected by carnivore...
---
I would love that (side note I want my fire cracker whiskey from the inside the vault they showed up and never got with the wasted on nukashine quest line)
---
LOL yup it's a pretty useless item.
---
My brother gave me a vampires gatling plasma and that thing just is insane! I don’t have to waste stims anymore! I always carry it along with my three other heavy vampires weapons. Pretty handy if you want to save on stims.
---
I have initiate, knight and captain. Guess I'll do some painting tomorrow.
---
Yeah I keep forgetting about the raider skin but my alt has a trapper piece and I have script and bought back at least twice now.
---
Yea mine does it some times too
---
#ATOMS! YOU REALLY DON'T NEED IT! YOU'LL MAKE OUT ALRIGHT!
---
Hell no.if you put your launch card in 1st I think only you can place  it
---
Yeah I realized after typing my comment that there is no way Bethesda would make that outfit free lol
---
Yeah I just eat raw ionized meat (tasty) with the carnivore mutation.
---
It would remove the fun in building your character because you would just completely max out on all kinds of perks.
---
You can already become an unstoppable monster with a PA Junkies Heavy Explosive build. Completely shreds everything and you stay high health.
---
This will help but I don't 15 on all would be possible still with this. But maybe a true hybrid build can exist with no damage reduction with this boost.
---
Saying this as if fallouts pfp isn't total garbage lmfao
---
They’re drops from forbidden knowledge and you can’t earn the other paints until you learn the one before it (excluding initiate which can’t drop anymore)
---
This already a problem and the cards can't even be maxed out, so whats the difference.
---
I died to to an assaultron full ass blast when I spawned at the beginning I saw a name tag sprinting towards the launch room😂
---
I see the odds are in my favor.!
---
It's the Blood Eagle skin from S1. Looks like an error on the site.
---
Lets see how quickly Bethesda fixes bugs that work in our favor.
---
That is what I am right now. The issue is is that sometimes I want to be in regular armor. But basically I am forced to play one way because building a hybrid at this point would just destroy my characters damage output because I have to facilitate different cards.
---
With those cards and correct placement of your perk points you could max all of them but one. I’d say CHR?
---
That's just horrible.i hear these story's on here at least once a week.i never hit a silo when someone is in it.its beyond lazy its just a tad scummy. Idk
---
Gratz been grinding it myself got knight- officer in about 9 days been trying to get Paladin for over 16 days now.
---
On Fallout 4, 76 and Farcry5 I chose male chars, as I want to feel more like "that's me" playing the game, I try to make it look like me as much as I can.
---
For GTA:O and RedDead2 I made female characters for my online play.
---
I think my ESO character is female.
---
Diablo3 is typically a female character for all classes.
---
It just depends on the game, play style and mood im in at the time of creating it.
---
For GTA:O I created a 2nd character and let my wife make it any way she wanted LOL
---
what rank is that unlocked?
---
Lately instead of reloading with ammo left, ill have ~600 rounds left and the number will just go down to 0 randomly (I thought I was going crazy I even have clips of it to double check myself), so bashing doesn't even help with lasers. ACP is very frustrating between earles scream, wendigo stagger, and 2 reload bugs in one clip (the premature reload also happens still in combination with the ammo going to 0 randomly). Feels like you're staggered more than anything else during it.
---
Yeah just saw they were all reset too. Fixed them, hopefully they stay.
---
if you're on pc i got one you can have, for some reason i've been real lucky with event rng lately, got fixer plans the last three times i did it (those are gone before anyone asks)
---
I was doing200-450 with a bloodied lever, a bit more with a Bloodied Railway rifle. But I moved some perception points away and now I am in the 100-300 range.
---
But I take care of the spawns: oneshooting them means heavy gunners can do their thing.
---
Sorry you couldn’t max two.
---
Most ppl I know don't get that far on the settlers quest cuz there's an annoying bug that halts progression til you Google how to force the next checkpoint of the quest 
---
It's when you have to find a keycard to meet Penelope Hornright I believe, or whatever her name is 
---
Literally everyone I know who plays the game got that bug, got frustrated, and just beat the raider questline instead, so they missed out on The Deep
---
I had no clue it existed til I forced myself to get past the settler quest bug on an alt a couple weeks ago
---
If you just want to boost the special stats unyielding is def for you.3 points on each special stat so when low health so you'll have a extra 15 points in all except agility I belive
---
Yep I feel you, that’s why you’re able to make multiple characters. I have a Lvl 260 Bloodied Commando for running around with 30+ AGI and jumping everywhere with VATS then my Lvl 150 PA Junkie to spray and just shoot everything I see without aiming.
---
I don’t think it’s technically raider but it’s black and gold like the raider handmade and .50 cal and it’s got the words black knight etched into the side. I think it’s actual name is black knight Gatling gun
---
Haha bless that squeaker lol, doesn’t see the real gem spots for nukes like VTU!
---
I don't know what causes it, but it fortunately seems to be a rare issue.
---
This would explain my big numbers and low health bar damage.
---
The only things non-canon in 76 are the atom items and any non-story player interactions such as mass-murders and nuking misc locations
---
SIXTEEN TIMES more atoms than before!
---
&gt; **Assaultron Blades:** Fixed an issue causing Assaultron Blades to generate Legendary Modules when scrapped. 
---
RIP dupers. Guess that's one exploit bullet dodged. Good to see that the PTS is doing what it's supposed to.
---
Aw, that's a bummer. The settler branch was really neat. Haven't done the raider side yet
---
And an Armor Ace outfit? Why are the majority of rewards for the enemy? I don’t want to look like them 🤦‍♂️
---
I tried to keep the good.stuff between 200-250 and the bad stuff I'd keep about 100 of it typically. If you play enough you'll know what you need in your average day eventually. 
---
Eg. I didn't need much lead as I was an unarmed build but I needed bone for the gauntlet , but that changed when the repair kits came in and I don't touch workbenches anymore. 
---
Also flux was sold or given away always if I wasn't actively doing something with it, it was just too heavy so much flux has been sold to train stations.
---
I got first recently for a month to try it out and load up on everything I can before it goes.
---
But also as I'm a hoarded by nature of normally playing single player games I refuse to drop a 3 star legendary  and thus always was struggling with capacity issues
---
Strange not really a negative. Lol
---
At first I read that as 'change Rule 34' reward....
---
It's more about being able to be a PA build and a reg armor at the same time.
---
Lol yeah, just confusing.
---
If this works you are a lifesaver!
---
I'm not going to rehunt all my plans and everything is the issue otherwise I would.
---
I suppose I'll do some of it for atoms but I'm definitely not going to grind the dailies like I did this season. I really liked the space stuff
---
Having your buddy break your punji boards and you repair them doesnt make you a raider, it makes you a toxic bitch
---
Haven’t received my atom for last month. Was gonna wait and see if I got them this month but I see that probably won’t happen.
---
SCORE auto Complete glitch? I haven't heard of this
---
Yeah, I mean, I have a 3090, so pretty decent.
---
Until Bethesda seriously change how damage works for single shot weapons (especially with DR calculations), DPS will always be king.
---
Rifleman is fine for most of the standard enemies but until this change comes, forget about doing any meaningful damage in a boss fight.
---
This is a bit of a personal gripe, and i say this with full understanding that this game takes place in America, and is made by an American company, but boy of boy could i do with some less stars and red, white n' blue
---
I logged in and haven’t gotten my atoms for this month.  Pretty much the main reason I was staying subbed for September.
---
One of the good bugs lol
---
Energy Weapons was the one that eluded me the longest.  Then I needed to find another, one for the display and one to use for the atoms.
---
Pretty much any of the melee options need skins. Give unarmed gauntlets, or bloody bandages.
---
The RNG should come from the rarity of finding a 3 * monster. Not whether or not that 3 star monster will drop proper loot.
---
So what does this mean for people who play on steam?
---
Ok I see ..its really hard to be good at both at the same time.only workaround would be move your perk cards everytime you get out of P.A ..i run a solid non power armour build but when i need radiation resistance I throw my PA on can still do pretty good.i would say try and pick one that you want to be really good and go from there
---
Are you at an event? If you die while doing an event you won't drop junk.
---
I still have this problem with my fixer and handmade at events like ACP, it will just randomly reload or reload when I go into vats or try to take a crit. I’m on Xbox. It’s super annoying
---
Bloodied rifleman commando here. 
---
You NEED dodgy, serendipity and an eye on your health. As soon as you feel damage, stimpak your ass. Avoid acid, avoid fire, keep some distance and always watch your six. You need to know if your back is against a pool of acid. 
---
Don't rush the fight: stay alive and you will cause more damage than having to respawn over and over.
---
We’re supposed to make earl stand in those spots right?
---
? Coins only count on character where they were earned . It does the opposite it penalizes you if you use more then one. You can use the unlocked slots on each character as your highest level allows but have to upgrade and choose those cards seperately.
---
I second this motion pvp is fun!
---
It might, but not enough to justify it over asbestos.
---
This is essentially the worst advice to give.  When I've seen bugs like this in other games after they remove the bugged excess currency they deduct anything spent and the best case scenario is getting knocked down to a zero balance and the worst case scenario is actually ending up negative.
---
As a Bloodied build, I agree. But synergy between Unyielding, perks and mutations keep me alive. So, I am tougher than some high health builds.
---
Trick is to run around at 25-30.
---
No, just walking around.
---
Why don’t y run ur own nukes and put them wherever u want?
---
Huh, weird, tell me how you did it 😂
---
jk
---
I’m still having it occur with all weapons. Even the hunting rifle. Granted mine is quad and it will stop and auto reload at 7 or 8 rounds.  But still happening with all weapons that I use on my classes.
---
Hahahaha and so true
---
No more often than not you food builds are the toxic ones.   It's part of the game from the beginning .  educate your self and it can be avoided if it's not your thing.
---
The Respondelorian.
---
Yes, I am using it and it 100% works against all falling embers.  Won't protect you from the poison pools though.
---
No problem. Good luck!
---
Not going to lie, i gave up, wren and grant convinced me i could live without an ammo factory or farm tiles :/
---
worse thing is, i still play every day, and the quests are easy to the point of being a formality, but i STILL can't get over how little that f'ing bar moves.  
---
It would help if they had tied the reputation progression into the dialog coming your way but if i have to hear wren say "i get your angle rook" ONE more time..., It's bad enough that they don't recognize how stupendously biblical the asswhooping i could give the whole of crater is, but the high level senility takes the cake "FINALLY someo..." i was here yesterday granpa grant, and the day before..
---
There's the glass dome, you can line up a doorframe to it.

Have you tried a plasma caster out? Are they sucking damage wise too?
---
I don’t like trap bases, but I’m with him on this one. How is that an excuse?
---
What you meant to say was a duper dropped you a weapon they duped.
---
It used to, but after Wastelanders dropped it broke for most weapons. (Railway still works.)
---
Yep, I'm a toxic bitch. Tell me something I don't know.
---
Oh please, you gonna jump around chuggin duped quantums in duped stealthboys shooting the ground with your duped tesla?  Robbing people exploiting repairing a trap isnt pvp.
---
You know what, that would actually be really cool if it's true. I remember seeing the datamines for that and liking it, the only thing stopping me from buying the screaming eagle was how broken it was
---
All except Endurance 👍🏽
---
Damn ...that does sound right.lol
---
That is what I do already. I just would like the freedom to choose.

When you're trekking the wasteland, and you feel something land: Diarrhea, diarrhea!

When you get smacked by a ghoul, and it gives you runny stool:

Diarrhea, diarrhea!

When big Earle starts to scream, and your Vault suit you do cream:
---
There's always two or three outside Poseidon power plant.
---
Yes stash your junk often.  And I miss your vids riley!
---
Then maybe I have 4. I am absolutely sure I have Initiate because I remember choosing captain over initiate and others a week ago. And if my memory is good, they all look very, very similar. 
---
I have been playing since release, I SHOULD have many rare plans and that.
---
It's incredibly easy to find three star enemies... There's many events where they're almost guaranteed spawns like Riding Shotgun or AWOL
---
Excuse for a narrow minded tos by bethesda. 
---
See in another survival game, if someone robs you, you can if able, find their bases and wreck it and take your shit back. So its all good and fair.
---
Fo76 is kindergarten in that sense. Or a bike with training wheels.
---
 Bro use the ps messager app
---
I do, but people seem to not care about the queen as much anymore, so less people come to fights
---
Before grinding to 99, make sure that the glass walls/roof actually snap to other sets.
---
Incisor
---
Why is this being downvoted
---
The first 4 are similar to each other and the last 3 are similar to each other
---
Interesting me and my buddy did just this last night, did the bosses happen to evaporate?
---
Vats
---
Not in my case at all.  I low level pvp with equipment I find in game. No duping no exploits. Max out at level 30.  It's fun!
---
I modded my chest piece to have Asbestos lining and went to test the falling embers and forgot to equip it fml lmao
---
Riiiight
---
Ohhh yeah I fucking hate this bullshit. They have a way to kill you, but you can’t avenge yourself. In my opinion, getting killed by someone’s base should enable you to force PvP on the camp owner. If he’s not present you should have the option to destroy it. Although I have radiation emitters on a switch. If you activate the switch, and as a result die, that should be on you and you can’t destroy his camp for that.
---
I wonder if there is any link to the mole miners and the dead money ghost people? Both were trapped in deteriorating suits, the mole miners being mining suits and the ghost people were construction crew in experimental hazmat suits. I wonder if prolonged exposure to the sierra madre's radiation changed mole miners to ghost people in a sense? Is there a link between the two? or am I grasping straws?
---
Exactly, if it initiated pvp it would be perfectly fair. Its literally hiding behind shitty game mechanics.
---
For real .still like playing the game though
---
Try it you'll like it
---
Is that legal? A glitch giving you more video game currency through no intent or fault of your own surely can't be held against you if you use it
---
Yeah- gotta get those kits :). We have been running both events on one nuke as much as possible 👍🏻
---
Hard to detect doesn't stack, the same with faster sneaking speed. Just one piece for max effects.

Same! but i still hold onto a full set incase i change my mind

You kiss your mother with that mouth ?
---
Dunno how this counts as goofy, though. It's just the same guy but drawn in the same style as Vault Boy
---
Same applies for picking up someone else’s loot. That should be considered the same as an attack. I bought 15k caps worth of junk, then I got done in by a Colonel Gutsy from behind. The guy I bought it from killed the Gutsy then picked it all up in front of me and put it back in his scrapbox a minute later after mothman dancing and shooting at me with pacifist on.

So now low levels are similar dps to us. Our builds have been nerfed and enemies buffed. This is now a hamster wheel
---
You’re talking about a very very specific situation. Completing level 100 the second it finishes?
---
Not to be a downer, but they have may have just been taking out the trash.
---
As well as one of those sweeet zealots rolling pins! Queen here I come!!
---
So the blocker on armour makes a handmade with a beam splitter into a shotgun?
---
I just kind of figured it was like game promo material that comes in the big board game boxes, the little mini poster or something
---
Big facts
---
Are you getting the Treasury Notes?
---
It's not just about network speed.  I have a faster network than my friends, but it's still slow.  Outperforms everything, including SSD, but slower than him.
---
I'm honestly curious, how many times do you have to die to get 60 secs?
---
I did a run where I died like 10 times, the longest my timer was 15secs.
---
Im didnt so no goofy 🙃 but theres a serious lack of seriousness
---
Now imagine instead of cleaning just your dirt, every single time someone enters there own car that dirt goes into your car. A bit harder, eh?
---
Yep, half ased pvp is worse than full pvp. Ark is a perfect example.
---
possibly connection to server, if your friend is connected to a different regional server that could be your issue
---
I want to play that. Is it any good?
---
There is zero reason to not get adrenal reaction. Unless you love to stay constantly topped up healthwise, you're going to get some damage benefit out of it.
---
You could probably even get away with sitting at 50% health, which still gives you plenty of buffer for health and you do close to the same amount of damage as a bloodied built at 50% as well.
---
Yeah... and it would suck but it would still mean I could just clean my fucking car.
---
Shit I'll let you come too big boy.
---
I know but those items do something and their FAQ specifically mentions that utility items will come with bullion at some point but I don’t know if the glass plans will be considered a cosmetic due to appearance or utility because.. it’s a wall you know?
---
There is a issue with atom purchases atm
---
No I run cation all the time
---
Megasloth backpack where the straps are its arms draped over you for a piggy-back hug.
---
It should have been the same thing that is at the train station, but able to sell to.
---
What they were thinking... I will never know.
---
But I do want to try whatever they were smoking.
---
I think someone said they buffed this and it doesn't work but I hope it does.
---
That's the only one that I don't have, &amp; most likely will never have. But I do have all the ones currently available as drops in the game. If someone was willing to part with initiate, it would cost more than
---
I could cover or trade for &amp; I would certainly never actually pay real money for it. Never really understood why Bethesda removed it in the 1st place. It was just a skin.
---
yes this will work unless you want to put it on strangler heart.
---
I’m stuck at 18 too 😣
---
You and me both! Sad part is it only works I think on the T60 which I never use...lol. Would love to apply it to my T65 set.
---
Didn't you post this earlier today?
---
Honestly just accept them and do the thumbs up. If you've gotta give them to the next lower level you see that's cool, but it makes people feel good to give so may as well let them
---
Not for spoiled meat.
---
You do at normal ones, the public ones (with the exclamation mark) you don't... except when you do, because it's buggy.
---
Never underestimate the kindness some people have, I got the initiate paint plan for free from someone on here.
---
Cooking isn't so bad most days.  I just sort by what I have ingredients for, then spam the spacebar til everything is cooked.  But some days, the game lags and spamming the spacebar doesn't work but once every few seconds.  Those days are a PITA.
---
Are y’all wearing the exact same gear and using the exact same weapon?
---
Oh right, I was excited for that at first, but I'm game it looks almost exactly the same :-/ gotta grind just a little more to get the Thunder pipe haha
---
Usually do, just didn’t have my phone near me at the time.
---
So do i, just not that part of it :p
---
you'll just never when some bloodshot eyes mutha fucka gonna steal your bloat fly carcass, cant neva be too careful
---
And they aren’t gonna sue you for having your account gifted atoms.
---
1. Why 
---
2. It costs them more to take your money than it does for them to not take you to court
---
Instantly finish the legendary run
---
Yes! Cause I did the Colossal Problem event, and got a 1 star chest piece from the boss. I use power armor.
---
I always thought their suits were similar to those of the Ghost Peoples in the Sierra Madre. It’s both Things that were once human trapped inside a deteriorating suit. Granted, the mole miner suit looks a lot less like a suit and more like rags, I dunno what to make of that.
---
I got mine after a couple weeks of doing it a few times a day. 
---
Then I got T65.
---
So.  Yeah.
---
I would have to say screw, springs, and gears while oil and adhesive are up there too...but I'm not sure why as I don't really use them much. I usually keep steel around or below 100 while wood is around or above. Instead of lead, I keep lead ore and acid since(last I checked) their combined weight weigh as much as bulked lead in stash(saves on plastic). This being said, I never keep gunpowder or very much steel unless I am making ammo right after farming. I keep at least a little of all materials just in case.
---
[Happened to me too](https://i.imgur.com/4GInOYs.png)
---
Are you sure it was the same weapon? There is a bug that makes certain weapons with certain legendary abilities 'magical'. This basically means that they do a ridiculous amount of damage compared to what they are supposed to be doing. Are you sure your friend doesn't have one of these weapons?
---
You have to find the cans though. When you're a cannibal, the food comes to you. Often, with prizes!
---
Meh, left most of the crap on the board so I didn't have to deal with the weight or the extra menu about opening perk packs.  What a pain in the butt.
---
Its good for when you are taking a beating , gives you a little extra punch until you are able to heal
---
all the cheap vault dwellers are gonna be commies and the atom rich ppl are gonna be armor ace’s
---
I get so pissed off I don’t mind spending 30 bullets to totally obliterate whatever it is stopping me fast travel. It takes one or sometimes two to kill something.
---
I used that black and gold one for a while but I honestly prefer the default one over either paint. I still use the thunder pipe though
---
Yeah we didn’t get zorbs outfit twice 🤦‍♂️
---
Thank you for asking this question - I was wondering about the same thing myself.
---
Still don't get why people say this.. even griefers
---
This is good to know, I might as well keep it if there is no downside besides the miniscule health loss.
---
Death has consequences, don't die &amp; be a winner, Earle wants all your ammo &amp; he will take it
---
Very true, I will keep it active then.
---
Let them get it out. Many people who were up in arms a few weeks ago have accepted what’s coming. Those who can adapt will and those who can’t will leave. I’m just happy the game will be getting some heavy balancing for once.
---
Exactly. Plus my play history is free from glitching. I've asked for two refunds for atom stuff though. If anything it'll probably be like the topiaries when they bugged. If someone had them you could place in anyone's camp. Who knows though this amount of atoms was obscene.
---
Blocker and martial artist
---
It is because you have started to see your 'junk' as 'treasure'. Once you start valuing what you have, you no longer feel compelled to discard it.
---
Welcome to the 'hoarder's club'...
---
They’d be localized to mining regions probably.
---
It’s also likely they either die out or move west by the time of fallout 3, as we would’ve seen them in the capital wasteland considering how close it is to West Virginia
---
that it is not fair, so I think it would be nice to count down after spawn
---
And creation engine title ever too.
---
Dense all the way :)
---
Yes. I’m a PvPer and I’m too lazy to change my chest mods.
---
I've noticed an uptick on prime launches. I think we're back to wanting to get some kits and flux going again. Also, if you're on the team of a player in Colossus when it pops off after nuking prime as well you can FT to them and join after the queen. Win win win.
---
Yet weapons weren't the same
---
Make it like the scrip machines and just not have a daily limit. Let us dump as much ammo as we want into it and give us the bulk points in one fell swoop.
---
there is zero chance they can charge you lmao
---
I haven’t played in months can anyone claim the collectron for free tomorrow?
---
You were indeed very fortunate. I've run accross a couple of people like that. Got all the asylum dresses but the red one in exchange for some instigator outfits &amp; hats I believe it was right after the last Treasure Hunters event. Gave them 10 of them. I was gifted the plans for the intigator because I was making &amp; giving away the other outfit from that event at Fashnaught (sp). Who knows...maybe I'll get lucky!
---
Red asylum, asylum hat, prison collar and responders backpack. A psychotic but helpful nurse. Well, that's my favourite so far.
---
Part of the problem, I encountered a 3* raider dog that was lvl 10 which is ridiculous.
---
Bought a month of fallout 1st almost just for this outfit and its gone. Just add them permanantly like everything else in fallout 1st
---
Your absolutely right. People need to manage their expectations. Based on previous updates and the bugs in this game I have a strong feeling that when this update drops its going to be a HUGE mess.
---
Its very unforgiving, and borderline self deprivation. But i played on official pvp for a long time. Its very unique.
---
Some Tranquility Lane shit.
---
End game should be hard
---
I'm lvl 212. I might die a couple times but I don't think it's too hard, its pretty good I think
---
Kinda.  They’re still ok, but I never leaned on it (on my heavy gunner) as a one hit headshot weapon like I do with a lever gun as a sniper.
---
A min/max heavy guns build and a junkie plasma caster will need 3-4 torso hits to kill a lvl 100 super mutant.
---
Is it anywhere near as unbalanced as adventure PvP in 76? Because I have a BE laser rifle and I can kill almost anyone just by barely looking at them.
---
It's not hard.
---
\- The Moleminers are one of two groups living in the massive tunnel networks beneath Appalachia, the other is a settlement called 'Burning Skies', full of the descendants of rebellious miners and those that haven't yet become Molemen. They subsist off of Molerat milk and mushroom flour.   
---
\- The Moleminers are created by a hereditary disease that affects 4 in every 5 people born under the mountain. Very similar to the Trog Virus. Those afflicted begin growing large, hard scabs all over their bodies, have increased rage and hostility as well as degenerative eyesight.   
---
\- The Moleminers have fully domesticated molerats as both food sources and pack animals, larger specimens the size of vehicles are used to dig out new tunnels and carry heavy loads across the Network. These packrats are controlled by reins hooked into their flesh.   
---
\- While incredibly hostile, territorial and incomprehensible - Moleminers still retain some shred of their past lives, being very possessive of the settlement of Burning Skies, presiding over them and refusing to let any leave. Providing for them as they require.   
---
\- The Moleminers run several somewhat welcoming communities beneath the surface, while they're still incredibly highly strung and prone to fits of rage - Some can be counted on to regulate some form of society underground, trading in various forms of 'scrip'. Those too volatile for these communities usually find their way to the surface in some form of primitive exile.
---
Ye,that hat is sweet!
---
Didn’t have 76 round beta,so missed out.
---
But it would be cool If they re-released it.
---
I’d snap it up,fer sure
---
Fashionable Raid Hat
---
Black Rim Glasses
---
Bog Wonderer outfit
---
Any backpack that goes good with black
---
The problem is the game, not the players. Anything with stars should be lootable by everyone at the event.
---
Yea Bethesda is going through it rn please dont mind them as they scramble over eachother like spongebobs brain trying find his name but in this case its to fix all the issues they caused
---
(Link for the meme because its funny)
---
https://youtu.be/tZQJhvs4amQ
---
I find it best to use bloodied if on a team and accept death for the damage trade off and then towards the end switching to a vampires weapon to survive.  If solo running a vampires weapon at 40-50% health is the play.
---
0% chance they charge you. 100% chance they either revert/ban the account. 
---
Slight chance they say fuck it and actually just let the person keep em because they have no way of fixing it that isnt banning them.
---
They don't seem to be that rare;  for example, I feel like on Uranium fever I average 1.5 3*s on the 3 legendaries
---
Because some people actually want the fallout series to be good overall, and seeing it get mishandled and the ball get dropped that many times it starts to make fans angrier and angrier. 
---
Then casual fo1st supporting people try to gatekeep anyone being critical of their moneysink, creating an echochamber of people that don't care all that much but are willing to throw money at it anyway. 
---
Then Bethesda mistakenly thinks that a subreddit of yes men and meh people accurately reflects the audience of the game, and then cater all future fallout releases to said crowd.
---
Everybody loses.
---
One of you probably isnt telling the full truth
---
People like you are why 12 year old me had a clan to look forward to in an old mmo. You guys make a difference. You aren't them directly but they delayed my depression and neglect incredibly. 
---
Thanks for being a good person.
---
I dont think you can think of ark in terms of balance.  If you’re interested id say watch some YouTubes on it. But i cant stress enough that its REALLY UNFORGIVING. Perma death on your tamed animals and you drop everything on you when you die.
---
Is there something like a stash, so you can store items you don’t want to lose?
---
This close to being millionaire in fo76
---
This is a really well thought out comment. There’s also the issue they had with duping and vendors in the past so there could definitely be hesitation from the dev team to add another CAMP vendor.
---
Asbestos lining and the debris doesn't do anything, it doesn't need to be nerfed.
---
Nah you gotta finish the main story to get treasury notes. It's dumb shit system but kinda makes sense? It only makes sense if you havent completed the main story before (which I have). Oh well, guess I miss out on the 200 or so treasury notes. Its just the dumbest system I have ever heard of.
---
I don't think you get my point. The dirt would fill the entire car and keep replenishing. Until you find whatever quantum anomaly is causing this strange teleportarion of dirt, you're not going to be able to clean it fast enough to drive.
---
If you're not using a SSD you're at a disadvantage and nothing can be done about it.
---
No, the closest thing is a literal vault safe with a lot of hp.  Storage is limited by how many boxes you build. Open pvp is open pvp. Pve servers are different your clans leader needs to agree to war then its a free for all between the clans involved. Trust is a huge resource in Ark.
---
The challenging events are the fun ones. IMO, there should be a risk of death or failure.
---
I heard the asbestos mod prevents damage from the falling embers. You could use fireproof instead if you use power armor.
---
Wonder if it’s a visual bug like the ammo “multiplication” in a trade my friend found, or if you’re genuinely ending up with thousands of atoms
---
I’m assuming stuff can carry over from each server. If I kill someone and get a good gun, does that stay in the open PvP server?
---
This is an entirely pointless change. They do this because they want a certain level of rarity for 3* items. If you got your wish and they made all 3* enemies drop 3* items, they would make 3* enemies rarer to compensate and bring the rate of 3* drops back down to what it is now. And probably break something along the way
---
Cant wait to grind for 4 hours a day to get to level 30 at the end lol
---
It worked for me when I had it way too close too my ceiling
---
I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but it seems any time I kill a lower level 3 star legendary from horde events, its almost always a 3 star item drop. Anything above lvl 50 generally a 1 star drop. Just seeing if this is noticed by anyone else.
---
Nah, you get the buffs with the cooked food, a little less filling is okay.
---
You sure? We were literally on FaceTime, I mean have your distrust but game is just sideways ass
---
"Never tell me the odds!"
---
Yes they were both are b2525
---
Just buy everything in the store lol
---
Pve servers are locked to pve and vice versa with pvp. Servers work very differently. Your base doesnt go with you, but you can bring your tames and stuff.
---
Magical damage won't show that much dmg, it'll show the normal amount but report bad numbers back to the server causing the "magical effect" to trigger, and besides we were both using b2525
---
Yes all unyielding secret service, both using a b2525 and same perks and chems and bobbles
---
You know I just want to say I like how every lvl gives something and technically the whole season is free, unlike other games that put this kind of season stuff in. Yea it means hopping on for an hour everyday to get dailies done, but if it goes like last season, you can finish up with like 2 - 3 weeks to spare if you hit all the weeklies and most of the dailies.
---
Also Im loving that there's new building options now. The new floors and foundations on top of a greenhouse set almost makes me want to set up a new base, or at least build one on an alt character.
---
There are so many little things that will mess up damage numbers, mutations, drugs, one effect or mod on a weapon, what armors you're wearing. You didn't even say which kind of weapon youre using. You give us no information and expect us to know/think this is real
---
I can't imagine using flux to get caps instead of making marine tactical helmets.
---
Yea it would be
---
did u have same mutations?
---
There's a super mutant that had like a thousand barbeques.
---
People think because it's not a single player game or exactly like the rest it's not canon which happened Tactics or Brotherhood of Steel.
---
As soon as Legendary Perks arrive I’m taking Survival Shortcut and never looking back
---
Would you like an unstoppable monster ? Willing to trade
---
i LOVE plushies so much yes yes yes
---
Unless melee 1400 per shot sounds impossible &gt;.&gt;
---
Part of the game I guess
---
Let the wastelander feed them! Nuka-cola!!! Saturday night!!!
---
For?
---
My guy here is going to pass Jeff Bezos from selling his PSN account with 200 billion Atoms
---
When I do my nuke runs I always drop on SBQ. Im so tired of running ACP and the drops are kind of blah in my opinion. 
---
For me its more enjoyable watching low levels come and attempt to help with the SBQ.  I also dont feel so constricted on time. When its done and over with I almost always drop the legendary items I have no use for in my tent.
---
The Subjucator outfit at 98 looks amazing. The metal floor and wallpaper also good very nice. Also, weird to see nuke key cards on there at 41.
---
I think it can be helpful to swap out Sneak for Adrenaline or Gun Fu for Earl / SBQ.  I don't leave Gun Fu enabled full time because VATS can be so buggy... but in situations in which I'm often not going to be able to get the sneak bonus anyway it makes me feel a little less grumpy about the damage reduction ;)
---
I think I'd rather deal with AFK event-mates that stand around for free legendaries if legendaries would drop for all players in the event and not just those that did damage, over this ocasional problem.
---
The season model is just a battle pass.
---
Yeah my combat shotgun has the +33% vat chance.
---
I farm legendaries and try to get some godrolls on my guns or farm junk, I like seeing my junk in the tens of thousands
---
Any suggestions? I haven't heard of such type of armor.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Trying to power level an alt before the purveyor super sale. I'm at 18 now, trying to get to 50 by the end of the weekend.
---
Find some lore or something
---
Thats what i do
---
Listen to holotapes etc
---
Encountered the fo1st not working for me either. was trying to put stuff in my scrap box and was wondering why it wasn't letting me.
---
I just got a new character to level 50. Gonna try a junkies heavy gun power armor build. It's alot different a build than my main so it's gonna take quite a bit of time/leveling/perk shuffling before I'm happy or used to it. Break out of any comfort zone you might have and try something new?
---
Changing atoms isn't, nor has ever claimed to be an issue.... For example people often get refunded atoms regarding AS purchases they accidentally made or were unhappy with......
---
I'm sure you're thinking SCORE. Not atoms. 
---
S
---
o you can go ahead and put your thing back in your pants, there's no Badthesda circle jerk to be had here.
---
Y u no make fertilizer?
---
It penalizes you if you try to switch between say melee and heavy weapons in spite if both being built around STR.  After this gets instituted you will be focused on either melee OR heavy
---
From what I heard it's from staying logged in while the challenges reload for the day. So if you log off at 11:50am est and then log back in at 12:05pm est your challenges shouldn't auto complete
---
No you go pick up gun parts or a stash or something. She plays the guitar.
---
By main story do you mean the original main quest or the Wastelanders storyline?
---
it's really weird that people get up to 60 second respawn times. I don't think I've ever seen it happen.
---
Whenever I read the word interloper I imagine Kel'thuzad saying it.
---
What did you buy with your 500 Atoms?
---
People in my country did that until like mid 20th century.
---
This comment is underrated
---
Oh the wastelander story sorry. I've launched 10 nukes on this character alone so it's weird that they wont even save up the notes i should've gotten for when i do finish the wastelanders questline lol.
---
Had to scroll too far down to see this.
---
Explosives was the toughest one for me to find.
---
That's a real passion  project. I have 6 left to find to have all of them.
---
That would be so nice! I have them equipped to my favorite wheel and i spam the hell out of them lol
---
True, I guess since I’m not too crazy on the camo building I didn’t think of the plans.
---
Glad you're enjoying it. You get to experience what so many are missing out on because of the negativity "reviewers" give it. It's an excellent game, bugs and all.
---
for real where are the fixer skins at?? they would sell so much
---
I mean, if you're aware of Shoddycasts video about stimpaks, just imagine using a stimpak and having dysentery 😬
---
Just leaving a brown trail behind you everywhere you go.
---
Yeah I think legendary farming might be all I have. Tens of thousands! Haha. I’m happy with my few thousand.
---
The world's most advanced holotape game
---
Maybe a new build. I have like 45 levels of points moving to play with.
---
What about using this with gamma gun
---
You might want to look into bloodied builds my friend. I have a bloodied Guass Shotgun build that does 2100 per shot when im at 10% health.
---
Mothman cultist ritual outfit and mask. Easily the coolest set of apparel in the game
---
Mole miners running around causing people to wonder and shit... Crack one of the suits open and have a look dammit!
---
On a side note mole miners seem to ooze yellow or green liquids all over their suit surface.
---
Nuke the burrows for hardened mass etc. mire for violet. Sw cranberrybog for red. Southern most savage divide for yellow. Morristown for cobalt, and whitespring for fluorescent (i think)
---

RIP Jerry
---
I stay way back out of range of his fright attack, also learn where the few spots are where the ceiling falls down and stay away from them.
---
Typically as soon as I enter, I go run directly to the left of the entrance and stand on the green port-a-potty. I then just snipe from there most of the event with my fixer. I pick off any/all wendigos too, then re-focus on Earle when no wendigos are out. You can still do a lot of damage from afar and offer support by picking off all the wendigos from the tanks shooting in the middle.
---
I can typically take a wendigo hit or two, or even get hit by earle and survive, but I usually insta-die from the ceiling cave ins. Don't be afraid to hit that HELP button, if someone's available they typically help, If you die, no worries you don't lose anything, just jump back down and keep going.
---
I can confirm I have died and dropped junk at ACP
---
Well I feel okay about the next one personally. I missed several days of this one but still finished it a few days ago. I’ve only done a few of the NW challenges as well, the place camp or lockpick ones only. 
---
It says they are adding new ways to increase SCORE such as repeatable content, whatever that is. So this one wasn’t as impossible for me as I thought it would be, though it can definitely be improved. My biggest gripe with it was the 1 rank up a day and 3/5 legendaries a day which sometimes just can’t be found or you can’t tag them in time. If there’s a way to offset that and make up for the rank up SCORE it should be an improvement. We’ll see though, because of course I know they want everyone on as often as possible. 
---
If anything completing this first one early even after missing several full days will allow me to not take missing a day or two here and there in the next ones as such a big deal.
---
Yep. Nothing like berating or haranguing a community manager who likely has zero direct access to anyone in development. 
---
Like the issues are some how, in any way their fault?  Like who the fuck do you people think community managers are?  You think they are in a position to respond to these kinds of issues? 
---
What kind of imaginary corporate/company structure do you think they are operating in? 
---
You expect them to what? Wander over to some programmers and get some answers? Or head up the hall and bang on Todd's door and demand answers? Like they even work in the same building with either? 
---
Yes. Let's blame a community manager, effectively a low tier liaison between the players and the developer..... 
---
Because if they started spouting off responses outside of their purvue I'm sure they'd still have a job....
---
Yeah, but who is drinking sprite? 🤮
---
I learned the emitter plan, but couldn't find it in camp building mode. What tab is it under?
---
Ultracite pa plans too. Not easy to come by.
---
Thank you for your comment it actually solved the problem, he removed the skin and replaced his camp, it's always yellow or green now.  TY so much.  💜💜💜
---
I'd love to finally get access to the area below the Rusty Pick.  It looks like an area you'd get access to, but currently there's no way in.  Perhaps there's a secret city of (friendly?) Mole Miners down that tunnel and we could explore more Mole Miner lore there.  Maybe someday?
---
Wow, you got that many messages from people asking you for unreasonable free stuff?   
---
I typically only message people to *offer* them free stuff and/or hopefully useful information (exa: Your camp's current fast travel point is dumping people off a cliff (if it seems like that was unintentional / they are unaware). I also message them to make reasonable offers for items in their vending machine or that sort of thing.   
---
I've gotten a few messages on PS4 that seemed a bit pushy but the majority of the random messages I get are friendly and/or helpful.
---
Nice one. Thanks for the information. I will have a better look when I'm off work.
---
Don’t think it’s broken man, I never use it at all and was grouped with somebody who is sharing it this evening. It was going off every 15 or 20 seconds. I wasn’t sure what it was it first
---
Edit-luck of the draw is what was blowing my shit up...Not lucky break. Sorry man. Two perk card I never use so I had them mixed up
---
I'm excited for everything but One Wasteland. I don;t hate what they are doing with it, but I was hoping they would wait longer to patch it in after maybe working in some weapon buffs to counteract some of the more sizable nerfs they made based on whats been said by PTS players.
---
I’d hold off on that. Patch 22 drops on September 15th and we’re getting legendary perks. Those extra levels will come in handy.
---
Low levels should get those chances too, did a good event, got a 3 star leather arm, auto stim, level 20, useless to me, and I was at scrip cap, but it made some level 22s day
---
I never understood what the number of stars corresponded to for the legendary enemies. 
---
The hud is so non-descriptive. It's like Bethesda are afraid we'd get confused if they put integers and percent values next to C.A.M.P. objects in the build menu. Thanks for caring for my puny brain, I guess.
---
My name is ~~Super Colossus Wendigo~~ **Earl**.
---
Btw what's the best gun any of you have got off a legendary creature,?
---
Simple solution, just have it break down the max amount of the type of ammo you want. I get that it has to be done in batches due to the way the system is balanced, just let me press one button rather than 9 of them. And don't tell me they can't add a simple middle school math problem to their code.
---
Nice, didn't realized that. I'm going to have to try that. It just dawned on me that if you kill all the robots, then it doesn't matter if they are angry at you... there's none to bother you LOL.
---
I farm the Line in the Sand event with an explosive 10mm. Even better when they all spawn in a group above the sonic generator. 1-2 shots tags all 15-20 of them before everyone kills them. 1500ish XP each wave. even well over level 250, I can still gain 1.5 levels per line in the sand event this way.  
---
The daily events can be stupid amounts of XP too... got 1100 XP from the hot dog eating contest this evening... just had lover's embrace bonus and a 4x builders' team for xp boosts and that was it. 
---
There's one of the possom/tadpole events for running down the hill behind top of the world too that you can do over and over and over again and get 1000+ XP per run.
---
All I got this week were auto completed weekly challenges. Guess I just wasn’t meant to get very far in the Legendary Run
---
So yeah it could be broken, not sure if you saw my edit
---
You're gonna want to stock up on banked level ups and card packs for legendary perks. You'll also want to plan out your new build, because the legendary SPECIAL perks open up a whole new world of possibilities. Now's the time to grind XP.
---
Next, you'll wanna grind for legendaries that work in the new meta. If you have any melee weapons or slow-firing rifles, you'll wanna throw those in the trash. They're garbage now. Instead, look for automatics. Bloodied is still good, but the trade-off is pretty harsh now. Anti-Armor is decent, as is Junkie's. If you can find a Junkie's Explosive automatic rifle like a Handmade, you'll definitely wanna hang on to that.
---
Finally, to get ready for Daily Ops, you'll want to make sure you've got a good non-stealth build, because stealth doesn't work in DOps. Also, you'll want to start making friends now, because DOps is definitely a team activity. Doing it solo kind of blows.
---
Glad to help, green thumbs is a must also
---
Legendary perks daily ops and the balance should add more difficulty and desire to lvl up (lvl up to gain perk cards to scrap for perk coins to lvl up the shiny new legendary perks which are pretty good). Update 22 on sept 15th will be something to look forward to, vault 94 reopening for free exploration 😍😊😊
---
Yes, you can
---
I'm on PS4 , always full servers, even when server hopping.....
---
You first roll the dice on IF a 3 star spawns
---
Then your roll another on if it drops a 3 star item
---
Then another if its a rollingpin or not
---
Then another if it has useful perks
---
Fun
---
Wish I knew what to tell you, friend. I’ve never had that happen once.
---
It's clear that they are listening they just don't agree with that 1 specific point. To say that they aren't listening because they apparently disagree with the point that many players feel is most important is disingenuous.
---
^ This man gets it
---
I screenshot my rep before and after turning in dailies to compare and see if it moves. Last night it didn't.
---
We've been debating this for almost 2 years now, maybe one day Bethesda will listen :)
---
I did it in my old base so it work
---
I agree a bit on the grafton monster, but the snallygaster has a completely different shape and posture. Snallygasters also have significantly more limbs than the molechs. The only thing they have in common are the long necks, but the molech is more snake-like.
---
Currently rocking the hunter's long coat and insurgent cap and the Veil of Secrets (which ruins the aesthetics, but I like the extra protection)
---
I like the long coat/duster type outfits the most (for now)
---
Come on.. do it, spend them.
---
I mean that's the main thing. If you enjoy it then use it. There are always small tweaks but if you are happy with it then I wouldn't worry that much.
---
I hate that bobbleheads cost so much budget to display. I mean come on they're just little heads 😔
---
very cool! I like very detailed tightly integrated builds. Lots of effort goes into that kind of stuff.
---
I run a bloodied 2 handed melee, not sure if you’re interested in that aspect, but definitely glow sight, tenderizer &amp; adrenaline.
---
Ah yes filed a ticket and waiting on a reply. Been there, done that. Good luck!
---
*sets up my collection of teddy bears and human skulls*
---
I don't know what you're talking about. This is perfectly normal.
---
It's a combo of old Raider smack talk, and a legit build that was/is broken. 
---
Food build as an insult, they're prey, they can't hold their territory against harder predators. 
---
Food build as a compliment, is stacking every single possible damage buff from consumables possible, and spamming colas for the healing, ap Regen, Crit damage etc. 
---
Personally, I like the flavor PvP is taking, With public teams workshops are becoming meeting places and thunder domes, rather than getting deleted instantly by a full squad of 4 because you dared try and grab some ammo at the factory. Once somebody busts out a legacy I walk off, but more and more people are hitting that level 120 uppity streak, then having some level 600 level them and their whole team, gives thumbs, and explains how to up the damage
---
Then explain why I’ve had people steal my loot several times in the same event during ACP and SE.
---
I think it might be too many rads and does not cause enough damage to enemies.
---
Ah, I see
---
Still dislike PvP in this game lol
---
It's at the ready.
---
My monster mash mask
---
Someone starts Quantum spamming or whips out a legacy or a Tesla rifle, I pull out my own legacy to rip them to shreds. Outheal this, motherfucker!
---
I used to run a bloodied sledge but it was only level 10 and not cutting it once I hit level 30. I’m now running All Rise. I’d for sure be interested on in you had some more insight on what 2 handed weapons are best
---
Is this another update to download or is it just added with an update
---
I've read this 5 times and I still don't understand what you said
---
And what the fuck are perk coins
---
It’s bots. People make bots to downvote on here.
---
Sure dood.
---
They disagree with the primary point that most of the people make about the system and have tripled down on that fact.  If they had listened they would not be making bullshit half efforts such as this.
---
For me it was the tenderizer, heavy bear arm, meteoric sword and the fancy guns. I do not really have anything legacy, the marine armor helmet used to fit that bill but not any more. I do like to reward people for playing well with stimpak diffusers.
---
They would just abandon it.
---
You are going to report it but you kept doing it to get to 800k lol.
---
Is this a specific pc or console issue ? Im on ps4 and have not noticed , also have too much time invested to get in trouble for some bullshit like this
---
And this is a step in that direction which is a significant break from previous fallouts.
---
Tip:  No need to nuke. Just visit the plentiful aftermath of the usual SBQ or Monongah nuke sites. The only catch is usually a high Radiation fluids. However, never fear, that's easy too. Just find some Ultracite near a fissure and collect it once piece at a time. Each time a bunch of scorched appear, kill them for the materials you need, rinse and repeat.
---
SQB areas have stupid amounts of Violet and Crimson Flux. Monongah has ridiculous amounts of Yellowcake and enough Cobalt Flux to keep you busy.
---
Thats a nay from me dawg
---
Bosses insta dying is the new thing on PC :(
---
Same thing that used to happen with daily challenges, you'll log in and some or all are marked as complete, but you aren't given atoms.
---
Energy Weapons are in a weird spot since Fallout 1 &amp; 2 and also 3 &amp; NV. In the original games they were at a hight of rarity and often players only would start developing the Energy Weapons skill much later on in the game when. Here Energy Weapons were top tier due to rarity. 3 and NV gave the player these guns much earlier on (a laser pistol in Doc Mitchal's house) to allow for Energy Weapon builds from the start, but also kept their power high making them quite popular with the wider fanbase.
---
Now with 4 and 76 this trend led us to Energy Weapons not being that rare and also no longer being optimal in damage to the point where what are the lore wise rarer guns are a worse option. Laser weapons need slightly better damage and possibly better ammo efficiency as the gun runs on a battery. Plasma needs more damage and/or base armor penetration as that has always been it's main selling point.
---
Laser: More common ammo, good ammo efficiency, better fire rate, decent damage, at the cost of being worse against armor.
---
Plasma: Rarer ammo, smaller magazines, slower fire rate, great damage, better against armor.
---
Pulse: ??? (Honestly didn't use the pulse guns too much, but I think they were a middle of the road option.)
---
Good bot.
---
This would be a fine change. It would definitely help with getting garbage 1* weapons from the SBQ.
---
Listening =/= agreeing.  Listening is the reason that despite clearly disagreeing they're trying to make some form of  concession.  I personally think the whole coin system is a stupid idea too,  And wish they would just award points per level, but  If they in fact were not listening they would never have increased the amount of coins per card traded in, lowered the coins required to purchase ranks, and put a challenge that awards 50 coins for level 50.  Like I said just because they don't agree doesn't mean they aren't listening.
---
It would be a PR nightmare to do either. This isn't Bank if America. It's not like waking up to $1,000,000 cash in your checking account.
---
I did that once by accident. I wondered why it was so quiet, and why it was very difficult to find an old biometric ID.
---
Negative, I think this may only be happening to Xbox players
---
Git  gud
---
...16 times the atoms!
---
It shows that they are ignoring the community to retain the system most seem to not want so they really aren't listening.
---
I just had the opposite spectrum experience had a pair of 3 star weapons (a missile launcher and a fat man) levels 20 and 40, I check the map and find a level 9 and a level 39, perfect! I track then down, use the gift emote, drop the gear, and the level 9 grabs BOTH launchers and then barricades himself in a box with shutters and started plinking with his rifle. Free minutes of this, and I've got a grenade Primed to chuck through the window. He opens the shutters, I chuck nade, get him and 2 walls, just as colossal problem pops up.
---
These 2 shits followed me into the mine! Spent the whole event running around trying not to get one shot screaming. Like dude, when the trash mobs are twice the level of the big brother, stay home with mama.
---
You're better off ignoring most of those anyway and just grinding out some XP.
---
For me it's my camp.  I have both smoke machines side by side, which you can no longer do.  It's awesome; black and orange smoke with bats off of the roof while you're shopping.  I put the flaming blood eagle statue up behind them.  I've been in the same place for a long time and don't intend to move, but I'm afraid to even touch the smoke machines.  Wish I had a pic to link. 
---
Only legacy I have is a FE90 Flamer.  I use it, but not to show off, by far my best ranged weapon as a melee build.
---
There’s rumours of the vendors machines being glitched again where stash items may appear for other to purchase.
---
Just store your vendors away again. Especially if u got stuff you don’t want to lose.
---
No I figured it out with the help of the others on this thread.
---
Granted. 3 Star legendary enemies now have a 0.002% chance to spawn. Event bosses no longer appear as 3 Star and have been reduced to 2 Star.
---
Thank you that fixed it .
---
But for thru-hiker. Weight reduction perks are like Pokémon. You gotta catch 'em all!
---
Dollars to donuts this is the result of an angry player/former employee who happens to be good at coding and breaking through firewalls.
---
gotcha
---
It doesn’t for me though. Whenever I try to it just doesn’t snap together like it supposedly should. Did you have walls in your base?
---
Interesting. I had no idea about doing that with ultracite. Well, I did for the xp farming in the cave. Nice one, thanks for this quality piece of information. I'll be on this over the weekend for sure. Thanks!
---
like 3%
---
First nuke drop on ACP.
---
2nd drop on fissure site prime, it will tigger both the queen and ACP again,
---
3rd nuke repeat.
---
If u got a good team you can hit all 5 bosses fir 3 nukes
---
because you re dying after the event is over
---
I bet THIS bug gets fixed
---
Dude. I could probably baby run a low level through the brotherhood quest in their first 10 levels and unlock every single piece for them at one terminal. If not for the level gate, and the fact that excavator is better for newbies itd be the first suit everybody would want.
---
No, I died *during* the event. I drop the dozen or so screws and teeth I looted. Someone steals them while I’m dropping back down into the mine. Then it happens again. And again. It happened six times *in one ACP* today.
---
Edit: a spelling correction.
---
awesome! now i can buy a third of a power armor paint
---
Again, listening =/= agreeing.  That's all I'm gonna say on the topic at this point
---
Try [them](https://we.tl/t-EYueq8YEb8) out let me know what you think, you may not need to have your settings as low as these
---
I doubt they give a shit about pr when it affects their bottom line.
---
They haven't fixed issues that have been in the game literally since release. They constantly make moves that players do not agree with. Constantly release bugged content. They even unbanned dupers with massively duped weapons and basically told them it was a warning. 
---
Anything that has to do with their bottom line gets fixed with priority
---
Have you checked your actual ammo vs the number on the screen.
---
No one cares
---
I've been to the second guys camp, actually play with him a good bit, he's a funny guy and the pipe on the vault boy anal probing station is just absolutely funny asf
---
Actually more like $0 if you realize that spending real world moneys on p2w cosmetics is stoopid
---
I think I've seen one.  Total.
---
I'm annoyed there setting up shop across the street from my bar. Now all I'll hear is CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP
---
I've given up on waiting and just hoping to be surprised one day. I would be very happy with Enclave black version of the Hellfire from NW but really any Enclave full model design that can go on the T-65 would be great.
---
Buy every think quick
---
I honestly thought my quest was glitched or something during the waits.
---
Urban scout mask isn't that rare.
---
PR is why they unbanned the dupers. That and the ringleaders are Bethesda employees who keep ways to dupe in the game. Imagine that. Never mind that anyone who buys a God roll item/armor has no right to bitch about duping. RNG is garbage in this game, you can roll 10k items and not get a single meta roll.
---
Bethesda has *always* been a buggy developer. That was always the charm. I don't know why everyone picked now to throw a fit. They're a company, and they are there to make a profit (and please their big investor), so ya. It makes sense that things that impact revenue get addressed more quickly. I work for a construction company and that's the way we do it. It's the way all businesses do it. That's capitalism. Companies aren't here to make you happy at their expense.
---
Fuck yeah, raiders!!!
---
SH damage is negligible.
---
No. Its a 1 for 1 swap after I think level 50
---
Please take a screenshot i would love to see this
---
Probably less then that
---
I guess your guy can really rock out huh?
---
Shit still broke
---
I did do the main quest for both factions. 🤔 Maybe I just forgot? I'll have to research this more.
---
Anytime :)
---
I've just grown apathetic to it. 2 days ago, I watched someone stream the game and get a set of power armor with legendary effects with an abraxo skin handed to them. I tell myself it won't affect my experience with the game, but Bethesda saying they take exploiting seriously falls short for me when people get away with breaking TOS on a daily basis.
---
Ran into a guy selling like 44 mill gifts for free at his camp a few days ago, and I've been dropping a bunch of plans, aid, and other stuff to lowbies to spread the wealth.
---
yeah its just so annoying an long i would start a new character but thatd take forever
---
&gt; the second camp has anal probing station. just thought i'll let you know 
---
Are they looking for hidden treasure?
---
Speaking of selling them, they get listed in your vendor under the "Meds" category and not "Stims", which is mildly annoying.
---
Oh yeah its the trucker cap. i got it for free i think ages ago. it was an early atom shop item. I either got it for free or for like 20 atoms on sale. But it was shortly after launch.
---
I probably will get a lot of hate but try roleplaying with friends you will be surprised how fast time goes by
---
Mormons I think
---
I'd almost rather it be auto-closed than be stuck in the ticket equivalent of Groundhog Day.
---
Hmm, i dont really have anything super rare :(
---
Come over to the dark side... Run Bloodied!
---
Whattt I want some atoms too
---
I would've loved if they also cut the cost to 50% for legendary modules. On all my characters im rolling either SS armor or the Gauss shotgun.
---
I'm so sick of getting 1* nocturnal pipe wrenches from earle and the queen. Please Bethesda, make the ammo spent worthwhile!
---
Ah yeah thank you I saw. I use that too and it's not working for me. Maybe it's me that's bugged then and not the card itself. I can try unequip it and equip it again maybe, and then write a ticket.
---
Because they are gearing it towards being more like the ESO of the fallout universe. They've said before they plan to expand the number of players per server (eventually). There are public teams, raid bosses, builds that can heal, builds that do damage, builds that take damage... it is what it is. If you want to play Fallout 4 and be a god at everything, *then go play fallout 4*.
---
Not a fan of low health builds tbh.
---
yeah i got a late start so im way behind the double score has let me unlock a ton of stuff i woulda missed otherwise. hoping to get a few more this weekend but i did most of my weeklies so its gonna be slow.
---
Now here's one bug I wish I encountered.
---
Yes just now with less carbs
---
You gotta screenshot it
---
I wish I had your problems...just kidding. ;)
---
If you’d like me to fight you over that then say it again.
---
Exactly. This game was a half assed attempt to get in on the gold mine that is digital purchases. This is why very little gets fixed. Bethesda puts minimal resources towards the game and makes crazy bank. It was even said from the start that this wasn't "the next fallout game." Its an experiment and it worked.
---
GL man
---
Then actually do pvp. Hvp is just kind of sad.
---
i have 0 5mm ammo on this char atm and 15 minutes later i'm still banging away :/, fast travel does not fix it, am about to try relogging  
---
edit/update: after relogging it showed my gatling having 45 ammo, and suddenly the ammo tab showed 5mm again as wel, but that still does not explain why the minigun was shooting single rounds at a time, which it did twice after relogging even tho it said 0 ammo, now both of them are dead.
---
Really I'm looking for weapons that can damage, not really into junkies or bloodied stuff. It's a work in progress.
---
Thank god scrip is a thing tho. Except the limit for the machine is so annoying
---
Yeah I have a level 20 10mm submachine gun that is a Bloodied 25% faster fire... felt like a huge insult..
---
If I had to guess, I'd say M16. If only because Tropic Lightning sounds awfully Vietnam-y.
---
Why do people get downvoted when they say they drop junk lol. Sometimes there’s a bug that does that.
---
On the other note I dropped my hunter’s long coat accidentally while trying to quit vats and reload in a laggy ACP run. Just wish the drop key wasn’t the same as reload.
---
For the most part. All indicators point to the ESO team taking over marketing and design after the rocky launch, but i still 100% believe if it starts losing money they will shutter it in a heartbeat.
---
If you put a normal painting on the wall roughly the same size as the game board it should place on-top of it
---
Good luck
---
Same, but with the "boost department" part, but it fixed itself.
---
The thing is I can't place the tree anywhere in my camp location, it's all rocks. I chose poorly...
---
Bloody mess is a must have !
---
Happy cake day
---
Can't increase the budget
---
That's exactly my point, that's why people drop them by player C.A.M.P.'s
---
Preston Garvey would meet you outside the vault. Another settlement vaults dweller, another settlement...
---
Oh no😂😂
---
I just got huge dejavhu or however you spell it reading this
---
There are no chicken-themed items next event...
---
Without chickens, there IS NO LEGENDARY RUN!
---
Depends, if one and two star enemies can drop three star legendaries then wouldn't it be better to leave it as is?
---
But... what’s the issue?
---
Haters gonna hate, Comrade.
---
The trick is to read it twice, then backwards three times, the forward again 4 times, jump, front row, low kick, block, left, left, up, punch. 
---
ULTRA COMBO hit x 32 times
---
I don't know about you but the earlier games of Fallout (NV and earlier) pushed people towards single builds, so this isn't unheard of.
---
Plants take up a lot of space.  Defensive walls and turrets too.
---
wow, totally forgot to put that. In my defense just got off a 12 hour shift and logged in only to find that i cant join a private server cause i dont have access to fallout 1st, checked my bank account and i was definitely charged and went through. put in the ticket and then posted here.
---
Worth note: "Game Pass" is not a game sale, if I understand correctly (monthly fee to use a game library, right?). If anything, it's designed around those other two sources of income. And while I don't doubt it picks up new players, I suspect it would not be in the sort of volume you'd put real effort into. That's basically what Wastelanders was for.
---
Well if your camp does damage to me, I need to be able to do damage back. That is the only fair point. I think people are mostly upset by unable to take revenge.
---
Whelp, if my rifleman becomes completely useless, I don’t think I will put anymore time into the game. I refuse to play bloodied since it mind-numbingly overpowered. Plus bloodied items prices are going to skyrocket since they will become more valuable to those who want to do damage with this new system. I didn’t waste all this time just to become even more obsolete than I already am (Stealth Instigating Hunting Rifle Build).
---
also the stairs and the lights
---
Mumbles has been amassing a stockpile of legendary weapons and armor, to what end? The moleman uprising?
---
The tanker helmet would fit well with the Power Patrol outfit.
---
By the way. How are we going to get the outfit anyway?
---
Even since I discovered a hierarchy of rareness in outfits and head wear, life has... never been the same.
---
I respect your dirt.
---
Foundations, walls and roofs...If you want a bad ass camp, don’t use too many of these they will eat up your budget in a hurry
---
Lot of "I's" in this post comrade. Not enough "We's"
---
Agree totally. I keep explosive bait for this reason. It deals paltry damage but I go for decon showers, fusion generators etc.
---
the legendary run itself is terrible, not the rewards. whether the rewards are nice is irrelevant because doing my daily chores like a good boy sucked the fun out of the game for me.
---
no way I'm doing that again.
---
they're looking for Vault 69
---
Should't there be a matching outfit for the Tanker helmet? I saw pictures of the outfit together with the brick house pump-action skin.
---
It was fantastic, the mix of bureaucracy and the boys oblivious to his the ferals were rushing at you each time.
---
What's your top quest?
---
What don’t  they?
---
True, imo I think it’s worth it depending on the rewards
---
Welcome to RNG. It hates all of us.
---
But the seasons works EXACTLY like a battle-pass does! Oh it's free, but you can still buy tiers so?
---
All I’m stating is my personal opinion, comrade
---
The one you need to give Nuka quantum sunshine to the drunk robot, that was funny AF. Even if the steps were meh, that robot made my day, he is for me at least, the best character in the game
---
Personal Opinion? Comrade...
---
Not sure if your question relates only to players selling the recipes in their vendors, but you can buy them directly from the MODUS terminal in the Science Wing of the Whitespring Bunker. With all relevant perks and chems, the lowest cost per recipe is 17500 Caps afaik.
---
Don't tell me f76 fans are this brainless...
---
I'm so excited for the new season! I'm also really glad that there seems to be fewer power armor skins- no offense to anyone who can't live without their power armor, but I just don't use them at all, so it was disappointing in the first season to put in so much effort for multiple rewards that I won't use and can't even sell.
---
It still looks and works like a battle-pass, also you can buy tiers just like in any other battle-pass..
---
So it's a free battle pass.
---
True
---
I've had issues like that before. Funny how they take your money so quickly but drag ass to give you the actual service. I've had the best results by contacting the company that charges you. I believe their name is Digital River. Try them if you get frustrated with Bethesda.
---
They should've just brought back the ammo crafting system from New Vegas. It could get a bit tedious, because of the 100 item limit, but it was still miles above this garbage Bethesda made. I honestly think they may have made it as bad as possible deliberately.
---
Praying to RNGesus is a popular pastime around here
---
Wow thank you stranger, I really appreciate the info!
---
(X) Doubt
---
I’ve been slowly getting rid of 2 characters worth of legendary junk... I log on, get rid of stuff at the legendary vendor and log off until the next day
---
Yeah, what that other guy said
---
I'm sorry about my grammar guys
---
You can buy tiers and the thing works like a battle-pass. So it's a battle pass that is free, until you start buying tiers.
---
*Insert blonde guy meme* I know, when i was level 30 or something like that, while doing a mission in Charlestone, the game decide to throw me a ghoul level 62...got killed by him 6 times until i manage to killed him...
---
In all seriousness, my dude, be safe and I hope everything works out okay.
---
And everybody clapped
---
Real life&gt; fo76. Be safe and god bless
---
I died like, 4 times tonight because of lag and the highest I got was a 15 second timer. Motherfucker must be dying every 2 seconds.
---
Should just drop Star currency. A 3 star Rabbit dropping a Pool cue, just give me currency points.
---
Did you ever notice the mining suits are almost the same mining suits the ghost people were wearing in the New Vegas: Blood Money DLC?
---
That happened to a friend of mine a few weeks ago, it doubled every time he logged back in and out, he had enough to complete the season after they made it purchase-able 2 weeks in to it with plenty left over
---
I still haven't found the recipe for them and haven't found them for sale 🙄
---
I can still tank your shitty legacy with quantum spamming.
---
Basically Evangelion's "Congratulations" scene
---
sounds like a feature if ever i heard one!
---
Try using the I-beams in the stair section. There should be something on YouTube. I was doing it a few days ago.
---
I'd buy out the communist themed items just for the cosmic rightness of it
---
Or just use the grocer backpack. Still.
---
Like said, the serum recipes can only be obtained by buying them from then Whitesprings Bunker Science wing. No one is going to have it in their vendor since that's the only source(to my knowledge). It would be pointless to buy sell it for less than vendor price or buy it for more. If you're on ps4, I've been buying the recipes. I can help you out with carnivore but I don't think I have grounded though
---
Well he’s right. Beam splitter weapons works as magic dealing even more damage in vats.
---
Can you hook it up with a complete list of all bobbleheads?
---
You need at least one ceiling and then you can extend them in the void,put pillar on the bottom and magic.
---
Because it take ages to find a new game, I want to have the option to get back in a lobby instead of quitting to the main menu.
---
Iirc, SBQ used to drop the recipes but that has since been changed.
---
Take care and be safe out there.
---
We'll try to keep Appalachia largely tidy for when you get back.
---
Same here. It's the last scout challenge I have left and I have been searching for them forever!!
---
A fellow chicken enthusiast. 🐔
---
An honour my friend.
---
The challenges sucked.  The rewards sucked.
---
In what universe do earlier fallouts allow swapping builds / strats easily? They use permanently assigned skillpoints and perks. They are the least flexible systems imaginable.
---
I insta dump the explosive ammo. Not worth the weight and stash space. Keep everything else for conversion.
---
Perk coins sounds like some free to play mobile game, not a post nuclear roleplaying game.
---
Thank u
---
Pic?
---
And such it came to pass that at 8 am in the morning i spent and hour listening to a mom talk about 76, for real tho, thanks for the link :)
---
I saaaayed, u gotta be curfol with dem fly carcasses coz dem mutha fuckas with blood eyes, red as the mutha fuckin rad rocket, be all up on yo fly carcass if ya dun gon watch wayer dey at boyo!
---
Thank u so much
---
Thank you so very much
---
Here’s project paradise for me the last 30 or so times I’ve done it. Three or four other players, all high level heroes; are off in the other enclosures. I’m by myself, I get my animal buffed up pretty good. The event starts, I’m protecting my animal hoping the other group of guys can hold their own. Within about 20 seconds I see both other animals are dead and now there’s a flock of seagulls in my room. We get shitty rewards and I leave the event. The end.
---
I farm all exp I can for maximise legendary perks, that and Earle a lot cause I like this event a lot and with albastos chest it's not difficult and great action.
---
Damn sucks they used to drop from SBQ. Ya it would be awesome if you could help me out with the carnivore, I’ve been wanting it for quite some time now. What would you like in return?
---
They did actually, but it was a limited time fallout 1st item last year
---
Yup, kinda like how scout masks used to be sold at the bunker...then there's me coming back after a while, only to find out that it became a rare item haha
---
Been hopping around for hours, can't find them.   
---
Xbox if anyone is reading this :)
---
I'm fairly certain that the plans are a rare reward for completing project paradise with all three friendly beasts alive.
---
So no you won't see them a lot
---
Thats suxs.. but a couple months?.. trust me you arnt gunna miss anything, this is 76 afterall...
---
Before this gets removed by the mods for not being directly about Fallout 76, just wanted to say that I wish you all the best.
---
Yes, my main has perks for heavy weapons, 2 hand melee, unarmed, shotgun, rifle, commando. Also I have perks at various levels, for instance Hard bargain level 3 and level 1, so I can share with low level players. I don't have too many unused perk cards. Seems I won'y be very legendary at all.
---
oops 😂
---
I play PS4 and PC, I thought it was bad on the PS4 but there the problem is just beth keeps introducing new dumb and simple ways to dupe.  On the PC it's the total wild west, which ruins the fun somewhat.
---
I'm just guessing a couple trust me it will be a WHILE
---
Be safe my guy, everything will work out and you'll be back one day.😁 and session items will be able to be bought with gold so no worries there
---
Wouldn't you say more freedom of choice is better? Why does it matter what most mmo's do?
---
Thats my point.. 1 year from now 76 will still be 76, just with alot more nerfs.. your not gunna miss much
---
I really hope this dosent get taken down an thank you so very extremely much
---
There’s something you should know...
---
My main has perks for heavy weapons, 2 hand melee, unarmed, shotgun, rifle, commando. Also I have perks at various levels, for instance Hard bargain level 3 and level 1, so I can share with low level players. I don't have too many unused perk cards. Seems I won'y be very legendary at all.
---
But the power armour skin tho... also thank you so very extremely amazingly much
---
I don't want to be a negative Nancy but i hate the reskinned  pa and armor skins it's so lazy
---
What amazes me is, where ever on the planet you come from, the motor registry departments are ALL like this it seems, everyone can relate!!
---
Our factions might be enemies in game but allow an enclave solider to wish you good luck!Everything will work out,dont worry at all!
---
Wish the people downvoting you would explain why this is a bad idea.
---
From what I've heard there's gonna be a lot but who knows its bathesta
---
Bad for me. My main has perks for heavy weapons, 2 hand melee, unarmed, shotgun, rifle, commando. Also I have perks at various levels, for instance Hard bargain level 3 and level 1, so I can share with low level players. I don't have too many unused perk cards. Seems I won'y be very legendary at all.
---
True.
---
I still expect a full-fledged Shitnado of whining for the whole week, regardless. I expect I'll be displeased with it personally, but I think I'll allow the Shitnado to pass without participating it.
---
If you happen to have 1 fluorescent flux, I wouldn't at all mind using it to make it. I have a few other recipes learned if you or anyone else happens to need one:
---
Adrenal reaction, bird bones, carnivore, empath, herbivore, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon, and twisted muscles
---
I could swear that the Handmade skin was a camo one(at least from the datamined pics), but now it seems to be another red skin.
---
Also how come iconic weapons from the franchise like the Deathclaw Gauntlet and the Power Fist don't have a single skin yet.
---
You would have way less freedom of choice if you'd have to have the same Legendary Perk build on every character..
---
Exactly.. what they "say" vs what they "do".. totally different. Bathesda logic
---
Yea we may be enemy's but to be honest were all just people also thank you so very extremely amazingly (enter thing here) much
---
They already know about it, it’s a bug on pc right now
---
I want the viper skins and I feel you on that not being on. I'm starting to work 7 days a week. But we'll both get what we want just gotta be positive.
---
That is correct sadly
---
What mutations/diseases, we're they both the same? Either using Rad-X or addicted to anything? Well fed/hydrated?
---
If you are on XB1 I can craft you sum. Lemme know.
---
If you are on XB1 I can help.
---
I am on xbox as well, I can craft you some tomorrow.
---
Adrenaline would account for it.  If fitted with that, you want to take every opportunity to blat easy stuff not just focus on the Queen cos you'll bump your damage up every time you shoot a scorched koala or whatnot
---
I'm pretty sure *anything* that isn't a **child-sized "sleazy bed"** and a stupid mat, or another half-assed vomit-coloured reskin would be [fantastic](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTtrn20wnc_amSWIqDcpcVm3_m1oz5IlEiUkw&amp;usqp=CAU).
---
Probably Turrets &amp; Traps
---
insert 'know' after 'never'
---
The utter isolation of the game makes some people, myself included, into Superman-Santa clause monsters.
---
Obviously I cannot get the best rewards. But not much I can do about that since in a public server I've not once been in a situation where enough people have played and been in all 3 areas.
---
But you can complete the event only protecting one.
---
I can still get formula P plan from just protecting one though and that sells for a good amount.
---
Will probably be in a armor ace bundle
---
Thanks so much! Let me know what I can give you in return. At least a bunch of caps. Thanks for the offer Shining
---
Yeah start new if you want to try a new build. Wouldn't be worth the loss in perk coins.
---
I swear that's the first place I looked, and then rechecked multiple times. But I'll check again tomorrow when I log on
---
There should be no difference between Laser Weapons and their Ballistic Brethren.  It should be a cosmetic choice between the two (and ammo, ofc).
---
I think the only time I ever see someone using an Energy Weapon is when it's a Gatling Plasma.
---
no, and i hope we never do.
---
Yup, my mules eat raw meat if they lucky otherwise its glowing mass and inert flux for drinks
---
I think you got my atoms. My fo1st renewed and I got nothing.
---
I'd like a re-skin option without having to wipe my entire CAMP. Shits ridiculous.
---
That's what i mean, i worded it wrong sorry
---
Could be one of those things I never noticed till someone mentions it... will be seeing it all over the place now
---
It truly is amazing how places capable of super mutant manufacture are always somehow located relatively near an area where both the Bos and Enclave are operating. Small world.
---
May i ask why?
---
Happened to me too, most likely an error on bethesda end
---
i would be fine if they didn’t drop 3*s all the time but like at least a 2* please
---
Huh, as I tested it I think you are right. Thank you, sir
---
No lie this one's been in my head a LOT lately
---
I get the compact version too (like when you move it, it closes). I understand what you're saying. 
---
I hide mine inside a single tile, half walls (steel) with roof and put my silent generators in there too. Then place a flag on it and it's like a pedastal/monument while hiding the ugly ass camp unit.
---
I occasionally have them in my vendor for 10-12 k caps. If I’m low and need some caps. During the Christmas presents hay day, I spent days opening gifts and buying serum recipes.....
---
Now we need a team pvp themed armor ace vs communists?
---
1. The rewards. There were quite a few things I wanted from this run. There is exactly one thing - the glass house building set at level 99 - that I'd want from the next run.
---
2. The challenges: the auto-complete bug still isn't fixed and they still won't refund SCORE when you get the bug; the requirement of basically daily playing is BS for anyone with a full-time job and a family; the emphasis on XP gain - both for the stupid daily level-up challenge and the repeatable, which is basically the only non-monetary way to compensate for any missed SCORE, continues to create toxicity, and fuels the use of exploits, at events.
---
3. The whole season pass thing is at its core fueled by pure FOMO, layered on top of a game that's just a fancy interface to a one-armed bandit. Remember how Bethesda doesn't want us to use exploits in their games? Well, this goes both ways. I refuse to participate in any more game mechanics that are basically just exploits for the human brain architecture.
---
TL;DR the rewards suck, it requires that I play in ways that are incompatible with more important demands on my time, and it's not good for my mental health and well-being.
---
I have a dozen or so challenges that won't unlock because the last one for each seems bugged.  They're stingy with those atoms, so I don't hold my breath for a fix.  Maybe they'll unlock during a new playthrough?
---
I guarantee this will be fixed asap. 
---
Challenges auto completing since beta. Beth: "Meh."
---
Quest broken breaking the story and not allowing people to play the game. Beth: "Meh."
---
People being given atoms. Beth: "Fix that shit asap!! All hands on deck!!"
---
Thank you : )
---
Oof. This means OP is getting banned like all the other players who tried to report issues.
---
I hope you used them wisely
---
First time? (Asking?)
---
You get most valuable in private servers now a day. Wake up Earle, then wake up SBQ but beat the shit out of Earle and his minions first then SBQ, repeat. 5 events 3 nukes;)
---
I guess because this is a public forum for discussing 76 not necessarily worshipping it.
---
I have yet to use these , or I am unaware that I’m using them , I saw had 4 before but the perk coin thing disappeared then this I logged in and nothing pertaining to any perk coins
---
Problem hasnt been fixed since day one... its been 2 years? Its just fast travel... Never encountered a game to not be able to have this as a non issue since release. I hope patch 22?
---
Use what you prefer. if it works better for you, then use that. No need to stress or over think it. Use what you like. If you want my opinion i'd probably roll with the anti-armor tho.
---
After going through more of the dialogue, it looks like that line of may have just ended up  playing regardless of your choice. There's even an option to ask about "leaving him at a raider camp".
---
Because everyone should know their role lol
---
Luckily not. They lasted a couple of minutes though.
---
Thought that was the way it should have been. Reward the grinders for their time played.
---
Lordy I wish! Alas, no....just irritating pop ups!
---
Thank you for sharing your survival story 👍🏻
---
Which sucks, because it's a lot of fun.
---
Yeah and the ones you mentioned don't repeat, literally, 100 times, pause and then start again. I'm also on a laptop, but even on a desktop, that's A LOT of screen real estate!
---
I did it with a number of days to spare too.  I've always said though, I am of firmly of the opinion that it should be reasonable to do it with *weeks* to spare.  Next year when holidays aren't cancelled by some pandemic, I want to be able to take a holiday with my family like I normally do, without it ruining my progress at this.  Obviously it's not up to me, but that's how I've been able to play every video game I've ever played in the last 40 years, online or not, including F76 before this change, and it rubs me the wrong way that Bethesda are so entitled they feel they can require us to be online *almost* every day to progress 'normally' in their new flagship game mechanic.
---
Then there's always some snotty little shit (not you, just saying generally) that says "you don't need all the stuff!" but to someone who's played the game for quite a while that amounts to saying "you're done now, piss off." because there's so little else being added that's worthwhile.
---
Laptop screen too, if it was a single notification, fine. But this is...exhausting.
---
You drop junk at Scorched Earth.
---
I’d say so. Doesn’t hurt to test it for yourself.
---
YES! Crap I forgot to mention it made using the map almost impossible!
---
I'll humbly submit LoneVaultWanderer and Final Render to the list.
---
So would you like to go back to the original model where players could just demolish your camp to rack up a bounty worth chasing? Conversely, if someone starves to death on my doorstep, because they died on my property, should they get to attack my camp? 
---
You literally walk into potentially hostile territory at every camp, and watching for trap camps keeps players a little on edge. 
---
Survival mode is gone, and nuclear winter is repetitive, workshop PvP is fun until somebody busts out legacies, trap camps are one of the only Raider role play options left, and players have to at least either be clever, or use gimmicks that are easy to spot (never go in a locked hallway for example) 
---
Maybe a nice split would be the old bounty system from survival, where you could put a bounty on a player that killed you. Make it 1000 caps to put a bounty on a selected character, plus whatever bonus you want to put on top, and put the NPC to put out a hit in an obscure clandestine location like the deep. 
---
Another caveat I'll give, pacifist making traps do 0 damage unless the owner of the camp has it off, ergo you could at least shoot back and try to engage in PvP, at least until they switch back, or if the other is lingering like a bad smell, pop them once to see if the PvP prompt comes up.
---
There are plenty of people selling the serum recipes on their vendors. I personally bough all my serum recipies for 5000-10000 caps from players. Now.. Why are they selling them so low? Answer is pretty obvious.
---
The only people who'd sell the serum recipes would be people who accidentally bought already known recipe which doesn't happen a lot. It's easier to buy it from a bunker vendor under all the buffs to charisma possible + hard bargain lvl 3.
---
Did you have a workshop defend or retake event in your quest log? A couple of times recently I've lost junk at public events but only if I had workshop events active as well.
---
Free atoms for everyone\^\^
---
I'm sure they'll fix this right away. Real quick.
---
It’s just pushing buttons. Lol.
---
Does it? I've been using the dense mod for 18+ months to negate that echo blast. I thought it was classed as energy explosive, not fire
---
Mole Miners are probably more often than not ghoulified. I think whilst the suits arent permanently fused to them, a lot of them probably have seriously damaged skin that has clung to their clothing and would be painful to remove. Isolation, mutation and fear have likely warped their minds though they certainly seem to hold a level of community still so I don't think they're feral. 
---
From what I can see, they're mostly male (which would make sense as I'm sure they're miners who were in the mines when the bombs fell) with a few exceptions. I don't think they breed with each other and unlike Super Mutants I don't think they have a method to produce more of them artificially. 
---
They certainly seem to hold onto memories, many of them have toys with them, watches, currency etc and given the enemy names we see for them (namely supervisor and foreman) they probably base their hierarchy on their former job titles
---
Paw Patrol lore here: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=paw+patrol&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;client=safari
---
What, who said you'd have to use the same Legendary Perk build on every character? 
---
Point is if you have to scrap perks for legendary perk coins you can't have have perks for different builds, unless you want to loose out on legendary perks. You can't move special points to change a build, unless you want to loose out on legendary perks. Hence "push(ing) singular builds"
---
Well legendary scorchbeasts are mainly 1 star legendaries, so if I don't have to kill them I don't even bother because 1 star shit usually isn't worth the bullets and time and meds. If they all 3 were 1 star SB don't understand what did you expect from them except 1 star shit. If they weren't, then nvm. But if it's some comfort they drop good ingredients for food, a nice buff to specials.
---
They won’t fix that bug or the fast travel bug due to not making them any cash. Atoms get given out for free damn they instantly investigate. Bethesda are getting worse man
---
How much time do you spend looking at your device?
---
Every weapon needs a skin for protection against scrapping. Even if it is just a fake one (no cosmetic differences) apllied via the skin mechanic.
---
76 is semi canon, which is down to the nature of being an online experience. Vault 76 opened, dwellers left, MODUS encountered some who he helped fire nukes etc. It's stuff like cosmetics in the CAMPS that isnt canon
---
Was it teathered to the ground with wire?
---
I can't really find a good place to put it, kids usually draw a raider encampment to it and it takes damage, im sick of manually repairing everything...
---
We have a winner!
---
I don’t know about this one chief
---
Yeah some of the camps are amazing. I like it when I have to do a double take at whether it's a camp or an actual game structure. 
---
I'm one of those rubbish builders you mentioned and mine is terrible xD However, it's home! When I'm a higher level and have more plans (I'm only level 37) I'll rebuild and try and build a better camp and attempt a bit of creativity but in the meantime I'll enjoy all the awesome camps out there!
---
This is amazing.
---
I'm meticulous about my stash management, I've got 218 lbs eaten by the survival rewards, I designate 50lbs for flux (10 each) and I try to keep 50 units of useful scrap (Copper, aluminum, circuits, etc) and I'll reduce my useless junk (asbestos, antiseptic, leather) down to 30 units. Ballistic fiber, ultracite, lead, and steel you can never get enough of, acid is highly useful, but I can sometimes burn 200 on a smelting binge.
---
Mom said is my turn to post this
---
Anyone who said that is lying, because that is 100% bullshit
---
You'll understand when you're older
---
That doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen concerning the season 2 scoreboard
---
This is really disappointing I’ve been stock piling laser wep ammo in my stash box, wanted  to use it at the later levels. Sucks to find out my favorite wep type is pretty bad :/
---
New daily missions where you play some of the dungeons in the game with a ton of enemies that have crazy mutations, like freezing you or blowing up when they die
---
How refreshing it is to hear someone who's really worth their salt. A few of us like minded folks have banded together, and we would love to meat you! We get together once a week to chew the fat. We would be honored if you would join our next together, if you would let us your brain over some moonshine!
---
PS dont believe anything you may have heard about us being mutant cannibals. I assure you we are nothing of the sort.
---
Traps that are visible is one thing, but the method used posted by the OP isnt roleplaying. Lets be real here. Thats not role playing, thats just being a dick. And with no possible recourse which is really the problem. Its no better then scamming someone, is that raider role playing too? This isnt an argument of semantics, its abuse of shitty mechanics.
---
The original model encouraged trolling since it was half baked pvp. Simple safeguard to that would be having a cooldown on toggling pacifism along side a camp being immune to pvp damage while passive.
---
As far as someone dying on your doorstep? Simple, if player was killed by something other than you, it wouldn’t flag pvp. If they were damaged by your trap, and retaliate then they become flagged.
---
But in reality bethesda is clueless as far as creating a reasonable pvp structure. The failure of survival mode proves that. It wont change that is obvious, but invisible traps are borderline exploiting. But if you think its “immersive” thats your choice. Its still toxic regardless.
---
Almost as much fun as I had. One instance filled up so I got put in an instance with 1 other person : neither of us had magic weapons so that went about as well as you'd expect.
---
Do you know where the ultracite ore is near Monongah?   I found one node of it once, and now can't find it again.
---
If you ever decide you need/want to sell a carnivore serum recipe please let me know and ill hop on and buy it from you asap
---
I've not completed this quest yet but I've done the funny beaucracy part, it was surprisingly good fun!  Except when I had to fight the customer ghoul...J47 I think? He was level 62, and I was only in the late 20s of levels I think. Skin of my teeth! I'm level 37 now so I'll go back to complete it soon!
---
So, make 3\* legendary enemies a bit less common as well?  I'd rather see more 1\*s and 2\* enemies roaming around but still know that if I saw a 3\* I would actually get 3\* loot.
---
Me? Levelling up to level 200 so i have 4 legendary slots
---
Like they listened to our 2-year long plea to be able to exchange ammo?  Maybe we should be careful what we wish for.
---
I think it's all of them.
---
My 50cal and minigun do it too.
---
But its not a big issue with those.
---
Two shot exploding The Dragon. I put the Nighthawk skin on it.  It's pretty BA, but so damn slow to reload.
---
I want skins so I don't chuck them in the vending machine
---
I think so--thought it was anything over 200.
---
Is this one of those "whoops, auto-correct!" jokes where you were meant to say Power Patrol, but it came out as something completely different?
---
?
---
I thought they added elite Ranger Gear but not advanced Ranger gear
---
advanced has cavalry symbol is on it and elite does not
---
I think they get the "wild wasteland" vs "gritty post apocalypse" balance right through most of their games, it's just the atom shop stuff, and now season pass stuff, that is trying too hard to be Fortnite.
---
That’s what I thought not sure tho thanks
---
&gt;I thought they added elite Ranger Gear but not advanced Ranger gear  
---
&gt;advanced has cavalry symbol is on it and elite does not
---
An "All" option would be a game changer...
---
I had to write all the ammo types on a sticky note with the 10x option next to it so I don't have to repeat look at the computer. Now I just look at my list of ammo and compare it to my sticky note and just take out everything that has reached 10x. For 1x, take out a 0.
---
Love it!
---
No fissures there, but any ore deposits turn to Ultracite. I don't know if taking them summons Scorched though.
---
Wrong one bud thats the x 01 pa ultracite drops from queen
---
neither berserker nor 25 are magic.
---
I believe the laser rifle beam splitter mod is bugged as it degrades it’s condition extremely fast. There’s also still the bug with the Ultracite Gatling Laser and beam focuser mod which turns the lasers into red even though they are supposed to be green
---
Nope, the full suit schematics are available at taggerdy's terminal after completing the brotherhood quest line. Top floor of Allegheny
---
Because it's Power Patrol, not Paw Patrol. As far as I know, Power Patrol is a new addition to Fallout lore and is essentially a G.I. Joe equivalent tv show.
---
I need picture proof of this bug lol
---
Sorry I think he meant the actual mods, then again if low level mods shouldn't really matter just the defence
---
Sort of. He had like a ladder docking platform leading up to it.
---
This is like the lamest complaint about the game
---
Ah, that wood do it*
---
Yeah, it happens. Same with some dialogue in the wastelanders quests. Choices don't matter apparently. Bethesda chooses for us.
---
Yeah, my main character has a pretty ok camp. As does my lower level but I really want to build something extravagant like that eventually.
---
No it's not magic
---
yea i just did it on my 2nd character, and had the exact same thing work for me. Normal world bugged out, but tried private and it worked right away. Could be that it only works once per server reset or something?
---
You'd figure the mod plans b would sell in the vendors then, I've had 3 ultracite jet pack plans for 500 caps for 3 weeks
---
Talk about people needing to get a life.   Personalities as well.
---
Here’s the thing with laser, gauss and plasma ammo - they are all batteries. In theory, assuming a cell is fully charged when the player finds it (and for plasma specifically, it can’t even be used for anything else, so why wouldn’t it be?), that’s a full clip.
---
In other words, in lore, these rounds are basically fusion cores in how they function.
---
Aside from that, I’d say the biggest failing of laser and plasma weapon is a a lack of a non-prime receiver damage increasing option. Having one would help them stand up to their ballistic brethren. And a complete rework of that stupid laser charging sniper barrel. You can’t even see the charge meter if you use any sight!
---
I even reported 2 of those plp and bethesda woudn't so anything about it unless I have video/screenshots as proof. Yeah good luck asking for that 3 days after the report
---
I’m pretty sure that the bad reviews are from people who have never played a Bethesda game before. A Bethesda game without bugs, glitches and exploits is like a sunrise without the sun. It’s impossible 😅
---
The drop rate for the mods people actually want is awful, for example I've killed her many times and only found calibrated shocks because I got lucky at a vendor once
---
Remove the extra space after `Vampire's` .
---
So it's back.   Or never truly went away.   I am SO SICK of these vending bugs.  Vending is an aspect of the game I enjoy the most, but no.   Let's play, "take down your vending machines and then put them pack, painfully reloading them once the bug is supposedly fixed again" game.
---
Yeah the excuse isnt good at all but plp are choosing to pay monthly
---
Do you know how long it's been happening this time?
---
You can dupe harpoons by shooting a corpse with a flechette modded harpoon gun.  You can then turn around and trade them for ammo points to get ammo you want.
---
It's a bit slow and unwieldy, but it makes it easy to get any non-ultracite ammo, so long as you're willing to become an Appalachian Harpoon breeder.
---
I tested this two days ago, for the record.  Not something I really intend to do, as I mostly use Ultracite 5mm...but I feel like it bears mentioning.
---
I thought it was the fire rate that  made it magic
---
People who like soda at night and understand how caffeine works?
---
But it even duped stuff. I was at stash limit and it created new fusion cores. Idk I’ll just store my vendor for the trillionth time I guess
---
I believe the magic weapon damage is tied to specific legendary effects and getting a large number of hits within a short timeframe. Shotguns are easier to get the effect to work as it's a splash of pellets all at once. The 200+ RoF is ideal as it seems to activate the effect more consistently.
---
yes, when coupled with one of the bugged prefixes/secondaries. junkie's, instigating, stalker's and/or 33%, limb, bashing damage.
---
oof that sucks man. I've been lucky to get full teams then
---
Hahahah good job, Ive got all bobbleheads and every single magazines plus tons of other things and its just taking up like, a quarter of my budget
---
Oh thanks
---
And you’ve downloaded all the updates and what not?
---
Well, I bought a digital copy. It usually auto downloads the updates as a part of the game file itself. I can make it manually check though.
---
I have gotten the Tenderizer plan during the last meat week, so I would beg to differ. 
---
As a Heavy gunner, rolling 3* melees is something I can only afford during sales.
---
Which, to me, sounds worse. Maybe they should get each phase handled on the PTS first and then go live with it. That's what the PTS is for, right? Testing and tweaking things before releasing them? That's what I'm concerned about. They nerf (balance) everything and then two months later they fine tune their initial changes, but players were just getting used to the nerf and they make it even worse across the board. At the same time they still leave all the magic, and hacked, guns in the game exactly as they are.
---
You should be good in that aspect then, I bought a digital copy myself about six months after it came out and it auto downloaded and installed everything for me. I am on Xbox though. I was hoping it was something easy that could solve your problem
---
Too much to ask for a bethesda game
---
Yo, if you are using Solar anyway there isn’t really a reason to blow yourself up for heals. You get the same by just standing around 👀
---
riflemen are useless against bosses. they can one shot everything else though, and are second to none when it comes to ammo conservation.
---
then again, a properly specced bloodied commando fares about the same.
---
Servers are down for
---
Maintenance
---
For how long?
---
I have this thought they make it frustrating so people can jump on Fallout 1st to get that unlimited storage. The ammo converter is that middle option, an idea sparker, like yea, I should get Fallout 1st instead.
---
Here is where they can design it better.
---
* Connect the terminal to your storage so you don't have to wrestle taking ammo out all the time and putting it back in.
---
* Add an ammo counter inside the terminal so you don't have to keep checking or accidentally clicking on the wrong options.
---
* Improve terminal loading of text. It's slow when you successfully exchange your ammo and go back to hit it again for the text to reload.
---
* Have an "All" option.
---
* Scrap the idea and use the tinker workbench to let you scrap ammo and get 1/5 of the lead back. This allows the slider option.
---
* A special vendor with a new ammo point currency, this can also allow ammo points to be distributed as rewards in events, quests, dailies, and even the Legendary Run.
---
Quesiton: Do you need radx in power armor? I never used power armor. Or can you explore nuke zone in power armor without anything more rad resistance?
---
I’m a cannibal problem solved
---
A melee junkie's build with plaguewalker, electrically charged and unstable isotope would be funny..
---
Call the character Heigan for bonus points.
---
Another great feature of Fallout 76 ... having to wait around for stupid events to spawn like a goddamn MMO.
---
Seeing the same here.   People on my friendlist are now watching youtube, playing other games, etc.
---
Now here’s a visionary 👏
---
Because the rest of the armor ace stuff will be released via the atom shop as a bundle.
---
Oh, yeah, I totally misread filbertsnuts' comment. But I recommend having several builds over leveling legendary perks. Just start leveling legendaries after unlocking all the perks you need. And with more SPECIAL stats with the new Legendary Perks, you may even need more Perk Cards. Get leveling, this system is Ace imo
---
The Q is done, the gun is the reward. The diamond will disappear on relog.
---
Nah, it’s legit, happened to me once, same in the ammunition factory, I was a low level who was already terrified of having a pvper come and kill me but the 3 lvl 80 legendary scorched beasts beat them to the punch, I noped out of there pretty fast
---
Both. I mean, pick one to start. But once you have the cards for one you really only need to swap out 9 perk points for the other. Swap as the mood takes you
---
Only been hearing talks about it for the last few days now.
---
🤣🤣, At least you have some idea then of what’s to come with this title. GL man
---
Give the other 99% of the NPC's some depth and reason for existence other than filling up empty space. If half of the NPC's milling about had half of the missions and arc that they put into the live in allies, the game would be heaps more fun.
---
Thats the plan\^\^
---
Thanks! I feel that I’ll need it
---
Well, you were right. Furious and AA are both primary affixes...
---
And in typical hacker fashion it's not even an intelligent combo.
---
You'd be way better off with furious+bloodied.  The damage buff from furious is enough to bring most weapons over the damage breakpoint where AA loses value and relevance.
---
After one waisteland, semi-automatic rifles do almost the same one-shot damage compared with automatics, and less than half fire speed, no ground pounder perk. If you want to participate in the DPS race, there is no reason to be a rifleman. But if you want to play a role as a cool sniper, be a rifleman.
---
Well the roadmap shows new daily ops for the fall update,maybe a new vault.
---
Vault 94: i've been there every day for like 8 months,i don't see how anyone would spend more than 40 minutes in it,before leaving for good. It's like all those locations you never return to.
---
I ran through in PTS and it's a different place. The entrance is different from what I recall. I hope we get that dang emote! I need it.
---
The entire RNG legendary system should be flushed down the shitter. It's a slot machine to make players engage in a never-ending grind for Bethesda's live service game. RNG gear is the EA Ultimate Team of Bethesda.
---
If they can fix the Gauss VATS, there could be some hidden potential in there.
---
I have a 3-star bloodied Gauss Pistol with 50% extra VATs crit damage and improved crit meter fill up, but it's worthless when you can't even hit properly in VATs.
---
But when it does, I do almost 2k damage per charged shot. Probably way more with a stealth headshot adding the silenced barrel.
---
Commando has a much higher dps
---
Fallout 76 is an MMO?
---
Always has been.
---
Laser weapons needs way less kick back, and more accuracy. Scientifically, the fact a beam of light has even the slightest kickback doesn't make sense. I can deal with the low damage, but it makes me sick seeing them jump all over the place like a bucking bronco. ffs...
---
thanks for info
---
Asking for Bethesda to implement a community suggestion is like a Monkey's Paw.
---
Limb damage being one?
---
Yeah, it did.   Hope I can find it again.   I didn't know about all ore deposits turning to ultracite.   Thanks!
---
I love the table football game already.my chill out area had a pool table but that looks oddly bigger than it should and it's completely useless. This is a direct uograde. The glass walls will be mandatory for anyone with a pinterest/modern type of building.
---
I would buy an adult bed with atoms without even looking at the price at this point.
---
I dropped junk twice last night at death...thankfully both times I retrieved it but my junk bag had changed back to a paper bag...so yeah, definitely issues afoot. It's a charmed life to play Bethesda games...
---
Many of the bug parts break down into acid, which to some people like myself is incredibly useful (I smelt a lot of lead)
---
VE UGL are hacked weapons, since they never droped as legendaries when Explosive was a thing on energy weapons.
---
I just hope it’s not explosives
---
I prefer going commando. 2 or 3 round burst takes care of most enemies. Instigating adds a nice touch when you need to rock and roll.
---
Make Ward non-essential.
---
What do you mean with griefers? And yes, I will be more aware of this then. But yes, if that is the case the system is broken when it comes to PvP. I think I will start to just play with pacifist mode on, apparently they have fixed that at least so it makes sence. Also, it will be easyer to not friendly fire someone by accident when I am high enough lvl for most events.
---
It's like he's trying to Dr. Manhattan his way back to us.
---
I got 3 different ranger outfits from 1st, ranger, advanced and elite.
---
No. Perk points don't go beyond 15, so it would only add to stats beyond that point.
---
The coffin one? Or the wastlander raider(this one goes with alnost anything)
---
So then it makes no sense, meh ok, I read somewhere that it adds 5 perk points
---
The loot after Earl is killed is the best part of the event. From a 100 to 200 screws everytime. That's awesome.
---
Yes, if you have your base AGI up to 10.
---
Great, a bandaid for a gaping 5 inch wound. Just fix the shit system instead of working around the shit symptoms.
---
yeah or energy weapons :P
---
Theres a wallpaper at least
---
But does it give more ap points if we lift it to 20 ?
---
Where do these daily ops take place ?
---
Why? Once powered equipment is already an issue so I don't see how adding more will solve it.
---
Maybe don't bring a short range weapon when there are long range ones in use?
---
If I had to guess you are either running melee or shotgun. Nice damage when in close quarters, but effectively useless any other time in group events.
---
Even if there weren't any one-shoter, you'd still miss out just because you don't have the range and wont get close fast enough.
---
Instead of generating a false report, for which YOU should get a time out, you should get a long range weapon for just these events.
---
Remember, it's not on others if you bring a knife to a gun fight.
---
PC?   On PC there’s a way of obtaining infinite atoms
---
Only after the event is finished
---
Yes but for me, bloodied built with full uny and 1 agi to multiple armor, it makes no sense to spend my perk coins on legendary agi, only if it would give me perk card points
---
If I well understood it puts 5 points and 5 perks points so if your agility perk points are at 15, you will have only 20 stat points but no perk points. If your agility is 10 perk points, you will have 15 perks points and 20 stat points (5 from the perk points and 5 stat points).
---
That's why i yelled in excitement when i got a  2 shot 25% faster armor piercing 3 star fixer.
---
Around many games really
---
Honestly...if you’re used to buggy Bethesda games, you’ll feel right at home
---
If your vendors have power they show up on the map.
---
And if you have the doors locked with the vendors turned on, you can bet your ass I WILL get to them.
---
Don't know but I absolutely expect it to deliver energy and heavy weapon ammo along with some tech junk like circuit boards and maybe even stuff like magnets and microscopes.
---
It should give you an extra 50 ap if you lift it to 20.
---
That’s incorrect...unless it’s just a PS4 thing. I’ve been on and am still on since 12:00 or so. Almost 3:30 now
---
Now i'm gonna look like a cheater for no reason
---
I don't want neither commie skins nor "Murrica', fuck yeah!" skins. They both look gaudy and garish to me.
---
After Meat Week there's literally no events coming out and you're just waiting. The other events don't give treasury notes so there's not much point doing them unless it's AWOL Arms or Riding Shotgun. Honestly the quality of the game just keeps getting worse.
---
Well damn.
---
Always commando. Rifleman is only good for basic enemies. Mostly useless in a boss fight.
---
Why tho?
---
Playing over steam is just worse than game pass.
---
If you’re on a server sometimes it will tell you the server needs to shut down. But that’s one server. He may have saw that notification and logged out. I haven’t seen another post about servers being down on PS4. This is an odd time for them to do it unless it was a big problem
---
I love when my rng is topped off with more rng, everyone gets rng.
---
I want skins to make the Gauss Rifle, Gauss Pistol and the Plasma Caster look like they did in the first two games. Same for any of the other weapons that have been around since the beginning.
---
 I just especially dislike the new Gauss Rifle's look. Both it and the Plasma Caster have a sort of "prototype" kind of vibe. Most of Bethesda's other energy weapon designs are like that too.
---
You can't insta down someone with autos like with VATS grenades. You also can't 2 shot someone by shooting at the ground with autos like with Gauss shotgun. High levels complain because it takes zero effort or skill to do either of those things.
---
Please look forward to those things coming to an Atomic Shop near you.
---
I mean... at this point, what else are supposed to expect? :/ Nevermind more atoms for challenges, I'd even prefer less junk rewards. Card packs, "supply crates", lunchboxes, *fireworks*, scrips and caps... feel more like slaps in the face, especially further ahead in ranks.
---
(Tbh I don't mind the communist-themed rewards, personally, but yeah taking a closer look they seem rather ill-fitting for  the season's supposed theme.)
---
What?
---
Auto or single shot?
---
I’m glad I wasn’t the only one who likes to play commando
---
edit...nvm, ur talking about the build
---
Time to put the bottle down bro.
---
Inventory management is one of the few reasons why I choose to play the game in my native language rather than English, like I usually do.
---
The different sentence structure really helps with keeping similar stuff close together in the Pip-Boy. "Statuetta", "Siero di", "Mappa del Tesoro", all legendary gear being automatically sorted at the bottom with square parentheses, it's really time saving, and life saving in combat situations.
---
Plus, the translation and voice acting is heads and shoulders above the past games, and the number of really stupid mistakes is down to a reasonable minimum.
---
For me the bike is the endurance item.
---
Agility for me is more like monkey bars or balancing board or the like.
---
Charisma is 100% a full length mirror where your character pulls off random emotes and photomode poses in front of it like shooting finger guns or thinking pose.
---
Yes you know, or yes modules will be on sale?
---
Yes, limb damage is one of the secondary effects that can make a weapon magic. That along with 200+ fire rate will make it magic.
---
The happened on ESO last week. People who spent the crowns were given a formal warning. Speculation was that it was a hack, Bethesda said it was a bug, &amp; to spend the crowns, an exploit.
---
It seems that people are getting angry if you call the Season 2 legendary run a battle-pass..
---
But i do think  that this season battle pass is much better than the last one.
---
Try Fallout 1st. 🤗 The loneliest MMO in the world! 🤭
---
I think BGS Austin hired a guy that can only make skins for handmades and super sledges.  They gave him two tries to make skins for the Grognak axe and neither went well.
---
They take place in existing areas of the game. I’ve done a few on the PTS that were in the burrows and think the the other place I went was the burning mine.
---
What caught my eye was on the mar.ket.76. Sub a random person was asking if a 1000 caps for a BE25 Tesla a good price? He bought it in a vendor.  I know it’s duped to hell but I can’t see anyone putting one up for just a 1000 caps
---
So the rewards suck because you can't grind? How does that make any sense.
---
I'm pretty sure that's a bug. My character with 2 perception gets that all the time.
---
Gauss shotgun is the second worst thing to ever happen to NW. Such a trash weapon. Absolutely no skill needed, and it's in every second orange crate I swear. Between that and VATS grenades, every round is just fucking around until someone blows you up. NW is dead because Bethesda has let the explosives be the most dangerous thing for months now. No one wants to play a game where someone can insta down them with a VATS grenades or shoot the ground near them from 100 or meters away with the Gauss shotgun. Not too mention the community on Xbox is the most toxic group of gamers I've ever came across. They have FB pages where they basically bully players who aren't their buddies. They all brag about how good they all are and proceed to post clips of them VATS grenading and Gauss shotgunning everyone. The only reason me and my buddies still play is cuz we enjoy each other's company. Currently working on finding a game we can all go play that isn't as trash as NW.
---
Don't buy anything, they might ban you for their own stupid bugs they don't fix or attend to.
---
In that case, they should also have 3 times the hp. I have to swap to a low level bad weapon when an enemy appears, so others will get the loot as well. Extremly poor design.
---
Oh yeah I never though about that. That would be insane.
---
Bethesda will never make any fixes to NW they couldn't care less about the mode.
---
I got so sick of cannibal. Every time I tried to jump out of danger I'd get stuck in an animation eating a mole miner and die...
---
Some mod plans for ultracite/strangler are stupidly rare and your only real chance at them is the queen.  Calibrated shocks and emergency protocols come to mind.  They have a less than 1% drop chance.
---
Why? What incentive is there to complete the event? 
---
Even if the event fails either you're in the group that gets a ton of XP and screws or in the other group that got nothing but also spent nothing.
---
As frustrating as it was, and I agree it is, it's really on Bethesda to change the reward system for events. XP and loot during an event should entirely be dependent on whether or not you successfully completed the event. 
---
Until that sort of change happens, your situation will always be a problem no matter the event.
---
This happened on ESO last week. Some Players were awarded spurious crowns. Speculation was that they had been hacked but Bethesda reported it as a bug. Any who spent the crowns were issued with a formal warning as Bethesda stated that spending “unearned” crowns is an exploit.
---
It better collect unicorns and rainbows for any chance to replace my Raider bot.
---
Gold is capped at 200 a day after the quest line is over. Treasury notes flow, sadly no way to spend them all (yet) though. The rep you lose choosing to keep the gold is roughly 3 days of dailies worth. You can’t make the amount of gold you can claim in three days. This is why many people choose to keep it.
---
If I have to look at a character for 2500+ hours ,why not making it a nice girl?
---
Its ok if you use a bloody with a splitter and can be quite fun. Durability is better than it once was and if you run the queen a decent amount repair kits rain from heaven.
---
I think would be better if every legendary enemy has a certain probability to drop items of all grade. Three star enemy: 66% 3star item, 22% star and 11% 1star, One star enemy: 66% 1star item, 22% 2star and 11% 1star.
---
Every saturday and sunday should be double xp in every mode.
---
I do both and depending on the situation for example the Radiation Rumble event, I switch to Rifleman because I can one shot the glowing one with my Lever Action Rifle. My problem (I'm  pretty sure I'm  not the only one who thinks this) is that after awhile it tends to get annoying having to constantly swap perk cards. So what I recently did was I got 2 ranks in each Commando perk card and 1 rank in each Rifleman perk card (mind you that I already have maxed out on each for when I'm doing the SBQ or ACP events). 
---
I have 12 points in Perception, I have all 3 Commando (rank 2 each and Rifleman (rank 1 each) perk cards equiped at the same time so now I spend alot less time swapping perk cards. Because I'm a Bloodied build and all my weapons (The Fixer B25/25, Handmade BE 25/25 and Lever Action Rifle) are all Bloodied I still do good damage, just yesterday I took out a 3 star legendary Sheepsquash with lees than a clip with my The Fixer rifle. So now the only time I'm swapping for my maxed out perk card is when I'm about to do a boss fight. So Definitely do both, I'm a level 410 and been doing both since I started playing this game, only at level 408 is when I decided to become more of a Commando.
---
yeah this happens so often, it's terrible. 
---
I always go alone in another side, and usually nobody comes, stay all stay at the same spot.
---
I think someone said something about the NW vault and how you can’t build near it anymore? Something about an adventure mode mission to kill Zax?
---
could be rad damage? afraid I don't know much about taming animals but I remember it affected cats.
---
maybe try putting a decontamination arc in front of him?
---
Three 3* weapons and you've already used up 120 scrip. Its outrageous
---
Exactly bro. I like to play my games in english, but in this case the inventory management in my native language (portuguese) is so much better. "Soro Marsupial", "Soro de Reação Adrenal" instead of "Marsupial Serum", "Adrenal Reaction Serum", man it makes such a difference. Not to mention, as you said, the legendary gear. My god. How they not see this?
---
#BUY IT ALL
---
I would like if people say why they are downvoting u/filbertnuts. Would like to know their opinions/reasons why they disagree. 
---
I get what your saying. Would make legendary perks more "legendary" if they are hard take long to obtain.
---
You might want to grab those perk packs for ranking up legendary perks in p22.
---
Yeah I had read that- sadly it seems that quest is nearly impossible for me to even complete, let alone with all three beasts alive. Oh well. I'll get it eventually!
---
I been seeing alot more people exclusively run the queen. Too high of a chance of having to use alot of resources with earl. While the queen is usually the opposite and quicker.
---
It took me two months to find plans for the robot arms to complete Robotics (*ugly crying*) these challenges are freaking killing me, man.
---
You have no idea what your talkimg about.
---
Tah hell with everyone else, don't count on others to help. Just do what you can and get yours. It just works.
---
No rad here, but who knows. I'll try. Thank you for the advice!
---
I’m excited for the next season, instead of space themed it’s like G.I. Joe themed. I’m mostly looking forward to that dark red scout skin, gives me something different than the taco bell skin from 1st and the bush Wookiee skin from the first season.
---
(I use a shielded BOS Officers Uniform for my full set of UNY urban scout armor, with this new skin it’s gonna look awesome. Can’t go wrong with black and red.)
---
Or, at the very least, a "for the love of Mothman take this 13000 38. Ammo off of me before I explode" button
---
Because I hate communist
---
Skins for pipe weapons are non existent. I want chrome with cherry wood!
---
If a video game is impacting your mental health, those issues go far deeper, friend.
---
The 15th. And yes unless they get pushed back yet again
---
The converted ammo factory up top of the map has a ammo producer you can set to most ammo types(including .45) 
---
other than that I’m not quite sure random enemies and loot containers would
---
Yeahhh after playing oblivion goty im guna take a hard pass. Bethesda fucked up vampirism once and im not dealing with that again.
---
Bro it takes two seconds to cook.
---
I honestly don't remember the last time I cooked something.. lol Raw meat all the way.
---
I would like blood eagle themed deathclaw gauntlets, where the claws are steel shards instead
---
Tbh, out of the hundreds of times I’ve done it, I’ve never failed it. Maybe you’ve just been really unlucky.
---
finished it like 12+ times.
---
1 fail near the beginning thanks to 2 level 20s hiding there and had one crash.
---
I’m on Xbox and only done it three times, but cleared it each time. I wait to see if any high level people join to hopefully make sure it won’t go bad. 
---
My first two goes, they were full groups of 100+ and went smoothly. Today we had 4 people over lvl 100 but we ended up finishing it with 3 min left, I was a bit worried. There was one lower level guy who basically just ran around dealing with wendigos and reviving so he was helping at least.
---
You’re supposed to use them on stats youre not already rank 15 on...
---
Perminate skins would be great. Not atom ones. Just different colours.
---
I have yet to fail it. Have only done it about 20 times though
---
Yeah idk if it's a bug or Bethesda never got around to finishing the dialogue. It's not just that quest line, I've had similar issues with at least 2 other quests where the dialogue didn't match my choices. I got rewards and it doesn't seem to cause problems as far as I know.
---
unfortunately I think so too :(
---
Yes, it's awful. I will continue to tolerate it because they added (Known) to plans you've learned. Picking up EVERY plan and recipe you came across because you weren't sure. Clicking every note in your inventory just to be positive you hadn't made a mistake. 
---
It was tedious and infuriating  .... and heavy.
---
No because there’s only so many 3* black powder rifles and pistols you can find before you wish for anything else.... I’d even take a nocturnal
---
Yeah, no kidding.
---
Destiny 2 still allows you to claim the rewards that you rightfully earned. I dont see why it should be any different here
---
I cant even manage to turn the game on
---
It seems the more players, the less damage you do. Also, what build are you? And what weapon do you use? I have a full uny armor set with one sneak part and the perk card set to sneak as well. The wendigo spawns do not see or bother me. You can also equip your armor with asbestos lining to protect you from the falling burning timber parts. And last but not least, try to stay away from Earl so you dont run around the cave not knowing where youll end up.. Its too bad youre on xbox, otherwise i couldve helped you.
---
Right now I have four character slots topped off at 1000 scrip each and I’m hovering between 850-950 on my main character in preparation for the 50% Purveyor sale.  An AA/FFR/25 Fixer will be nice to have after p22 goes live.
---
I’m doing daily quests for scrip and continuing to drift around the Mire and Bog in between SBQ and ACP events.  Not launching my own nukes, just going with the flow on a given server.  I’m basically in casual mode with no sense of urgency about anything.  It’s very relaxing.
---
Leader bobbles, cranberry relish/cobbler, nukacranberry. Then hit uranium fever, heart of the swamp, line in the sand and one violent night.
---
Advanced Riot Gear. We have gas masks and batons. How about teargas rounds for your grenade launcher? I think I'll stick to lethal force, but if you want to play crowd control knock yourself out.
---
Radiation rumble, if you solo that expect to fail... but it is a near endless ghoul spawn
---
At least a BOSS 3 stars should have 100% chance...
---
Even the Wendigo collossus can drop one star gear, it's kind of anticlimactic...
---
You may want to search around. This might be the quest where people has some success using a fallout 1st server.
---
SSD!!  SSD!!  The players that are already geared up and fighting has bought an SSD! Tbh I thought it was unfair at first but technology is moving in that direction. Consoles will no longer come with regular HDD.  U could sit and wait until ur children have grandchildren for bethesda to fix it or spend $50 for an SSD
---
If you have to scrap perks for legendary perk coins you can't have have perks for different builds, unless you want to loose out on legendary perks. You can't move special points to change a build, unless you want to loose out on legendary perks. Hence " forces people to make multiple toons for each build "
---
Do it on an alt slot.  You’ll want those cards for legendary perks.
---
Once you run through those hit WesTek for super mutants
---
Buy everything.
---
Hhhmmmm this link is to kids toys
---
Brothers and steel, probably.
---
First one was Buck Rogers
---
Guided meditation is currently glitched after the first group of ghouls don’t shoot any of the other groups that spawn further away and you’ll have an easy event finish. I just made a post about it
---
Thats not something you can do, even with the spawn hack. A weapon would need to have multiple legendary slot 1s for multiple 1st star legendary mods to be attached. 
---
Some explosive explosive weapons might exist, because they left the old fallout 4 1st star explosive in the files, so it is both a 1st star and 2nd star mod, but for general effects that was impossible even with the spawn hack.
---
Just looking forward to being a knock off CobrA Commander
---
Griefers are the ppl they will follow you round constantly trying to get you to PvP them. Shooting at you throwing grenades following you around just being a pain in the ass till you fight them
---
it's almost like those who put in the most effort get the best rewards. That's proper WACK!
---
I always craft a few modded under armors, low level guns, leather pieces, ammo and whenever I come accross a low level I drop it. It feels nice.
---
How is it spoilers you can goto Bethesda net to see it? 
---
But no I like it it’s a whole building set for free all it requires is you play the game. Stop complaining about free stuff. 
---
unless you plan on sinking money into the seasons 2 pass I don’t think you should complain.
---
Preach it. I’m bleeding red white ‘n blue out of my eyes and ears at this point...
---
Wish we could get anything that’s more Fallout related (wasteland-ish Jury rigged, enclave, BOS, Tribal, etc...) than generic “American flavored”.
---
it's hard for those who don't have much time to play :/
---
My main is enclave,.....he is waiting for orders been under cover this whole time was recruited by his mother.
---
For sure
---
But I started the first run weeks later than everyone else and still finished it. Before the season finished. 
---
This is with me dividing my time between this and two other games as well as work it’s free stuff if you don’t get it you’ll have the chance to purchase it for bullion
---
it's easy to say that when you have a lot of time to play, rethink.
---
Like Skyrim's Blackreach? That'd be sweet...
---
Look at my other reply and you’ll see I’m limited
---
If you enjoy building on structures, there’s several spots located on the middle bottom of the map. Fast travel to the Garrahan mining hq and follow the road going east. There’s one spot with a greenhouse and two npc spawns, then further down there’s a shed and a pumpkin patch, and another spot across from it but with a corn patch. Only sucking thing about the last two spots is it’s a monster spawn point. 
---
I built mine on the greenhouse and made a miniature town.
---
I die so much it's maddening. I even died right when it ended and lost all my junk cause it spawned me outside. Also, how annoying is it that it spawns you in a Nuke Zone outside when you die after it ends? I like the idea of the event, but it sucks
---
Nice , could need some more as a Junkie
---
Had the same issue, was confused why I couldn't put stuff into my scrapbox and couldn't place my tent.
---
 From what I can see in a couple of posts scattered around the sub is that there's a bug going around that's adding ludicrous amounts of atoms to people's accounts and that it's tied to renewing a fo1st subscription. My best assumption is that they've disabled fo1st while they're trying to fix this issue.
---
But of course it’s easier to complain about free stuff than to... think
---
I don't think I'm using a very good build, I use the rifle build, I usually don't have a low life so I'm wearing the avant-garde secret service armor, I'm probably doing silly, but I intend to switch to the Bloody command build.
---
explosive lever rifle and another that has furies. recommend me something?
---
Check out the Mappallacia maps to find ones with Ore deposits in that area.
---
Caps go to your account. Gold goes to a single character. If you didn't get either complain to Bethesda. Good luck.
---
What about in Skyrim? I wasn’t too fond of it then either.
---
Getting ready for the next season I see
---
They are adding 7 double weekly events and adding extra weeklys. That added with completing some dailies could get you there. I missed 3 weeks on this recent event. Got it 100% and no atoms spent
---
has 3 stars each, I don't remember exactly what they are, I'm open for tips
---
Well, let's hope the restructured system gonna be as flexible as they promised.
---
B2525 Fixer, BoS Jumpsuit, and both Scout Masks
---
I usually have plenty of space it's just I tend to procrastinate converting it lol.
---
All public events give treasury notes and there are a few of them
---
I play sims 4 a lot so I’m getting better with the mechanics in this game. Just made an actually house and I’m super impressed with it. 
---
I’m just missing plants and a lot of essentials for home 😂😂
---
Exact same boat started late still finished it
---
Nano Nano Take me to your leader !
---
This happens often for me if I'm solo at the event but usually I'm farming exp so I end up chasing them about. Definitely an easy completion though if nobody else warps in.
---
I wonder if the dirty diaper, booger eating, gauss shotgun users, actually think that they are good at the game? I didnt think that I would ever get tired of NW but I can't stand the explosives and not being able to stim through them to have a chance to fight back
---
do you think whoever is in category 93 can still make it?
---
Dump both of those perks.  For the point cost, they’re horribly inefficient.  You can get so much more value out of so many other cards.
---
It’s really not that expensive to repair gear, and you can swap in cards for 200% durability.  If you’re scrap poor and/or low level, use power armor until you can amass ballistic fiber and whatnot.  My heavy gunner lives in power armor and I may have repaired it 7-8 times in the past year and a half.
---
Dead enemies can’t break your armor, so my advice would be to max out on damage.  Stealth is also great for armor durability, but it only works well if you build for it.
---
Yeah I enjoyed sitting in the chair playing zetan invaders for five minutes after getting my legendary from the first group that spawns
---
bethesda after resolving this: "thank you for report. you can keep 10 atoms as compensation"
---
It's all about how the nuke drops.. Just like the queen you can be totally safe afterwards
---
For the special legendary cards they give both 5 of the stat and 5 points towards perk cards. However perk point stats are capped at 15 so say your agility is already 15 and you get the +5 legendary perk,you will now have 20 agility but you will still only have 15 agility for perk distribution. The best way is to use it on a special stat that is currently at 10.
---
The fact that we completed ACP, and I got a damn Nocturnal Rolling pin made me lose it.
---
Did it alone with a random dude yesterday that didn't know what to do other than aggro everything and then die.. 30 seconds left when Earle died 👌👀👍
---
I want one thing and one thing only from season 2! The Greenhouse windows from lvl 99 on the board. Nothing is gonna stop me!
---
I would love being able to crawl to cover after being downed, but it would upset all the v.a.t. naders and gauss shitgun users because it would require them to aim at u to thirst u
---
Sneak is your savior unless you're a heavy build 😁
---
Yeah. i jump on the roof near the bridge and kill the 2 that rush it. Then i chill out. 
---
Until some clownshoe comes along and then the ghouls start attacking and then you're all 'okay!' as the ghouls only come from 2 directions really. There's 2 of you. Sorted. NOPE! You notice the other side is getting wrecked. And the other person is next to you on your side and you're like what. This isn't very zen. So you rush over to the other side and repair it. And kill the ghouls there. And then you notice the side you were just on getting beat up and they're on your side now. MY CHILL IS NOT CHILLED ANYMORE!
---
Yes you have actively ruined my chill good sir... gonna need to come back her later for my zen 😂
---
Nuka Cola and Nuka Cola quantum - you mix it with grenade and poof! Colorfull atomic explosion :) Im always lookin for them and buying from ppl. Cheers!
---
Yeah I was in 89 when zorbo was on space 92 could catch him by doing the daily score things except from nw
---
I wouldnt even be surprised if they banned people for their own fuckups.
---
Most likely if you hit all dailies. Is there a double score week or something atm?
---
Oh there is 0 doubt in my mind that at least something will be delayed
---
I’ve just seen that zorbo is on space 95 your just behind him. You can easily beat him with the dailies . 4500 score from all score mission 5000 if you include nw challenges which I don’t. Plus the 16,000 from the weekly challenges. Excluding the 200 every 10,000 exp
---
Doesn't really address the issues, though, does it?!
---
Players that have re-specced a character still start with less perk coins than those who have not.
---
Players that lost Perk Cards as they were duplicates are also losing out on Perk Coins.
---
Yeh double score on dailies and weeklies atm.
---
You mean team medic i guess, pretty sure it work and that's very strong if you stand shooting  along other minigun-like user as those guys can't stim right away without a trick.  work only with team members 
---
In fact born survivor level 1 is one of the most usefull perk in the game
---
I had fun at last ACP because i wasn't counting in the event at all...  
---
WOT?  
---
I've killed Earl (got the loot) with two other players and one i joined, public team leader, after the event wasn't accessible anymore...  
---
So at the end, because i wasn't in the event,  i had the pleasure to be allowed to stay for a chat with earl and to grind all the wendigos out here for 15 minutes in perfect silence...   
---
I only died when i approached the fall entrance and loose my billion crews cause i couldn't go back.. But not the ammo!
---
Hopefully it’s the nerf that gets delayed
---
Have done it 30-40 times. Only failed once, due to it being me at level 130'ish, and a level 230'ish, in an instance with a horde of under level 50s. I have no idea where they all came from, but after they all died, multiple times, they all hid in the bit where you respawn.
---
I had a magic shotgun and the other guy had a fixer. Neither of us were OP enough to take it down together, though.
---
Go Commando after patch 22 riflemen is completely useless
---
I'm having the same issue on xbox, any suggestions for fixing? I've restarted both the xbox and my game but it's not working
---
The best practice is nuking the mine just once and prime twice, you get 3 Earle's and 2 Queens like that.
---
That is what I thought, thanks. My build is currently well prepared with 10 at Strenght, Perception, Agility and 6 at Intelligence to make 11. I can't wait for the 09/15. I Just hope there will be no more delay for legendary perks...
---
I really want a Cryolator skin and some variety at least make all skins that are achievable through the new armor ace season compatible with all ranged or melee weapons instead of just specifics
---
Now I want more weapon wheel slots...
---
Thanks everyone! I used the wood chucker card and scrapper and did events so I’m replenished!
---
From what I remember, if you’re solo hang out by the bridge speaker. They will only attack them in a specific order, so if the bridge one gets destroyed they move to the side speaker. It’s not really broken, it’s just easy as hell if you’re solo and know to hang out by the bridge
---
Of course it isn’t broken. It just works
---
This need to be a retired topic. We all agree, no use creating more posts about it.
---
Resubbing is currently broken right now or at least it was last night so it might not be fixed yet.
---
Same old thing: patches and glitches, broken quests, atoms became rare, people who would rather break the game than play it, people who would rather kill you than quest, people that haven't played in months show up and want to know what they missed. Just another day in the Wasteland.
---
have you tried fully closing the game?
---
🤣🤣🤣 I was thinking that as soon as I posted my previous comment. But I figured I would just leave it alone
---
Dear god, or armor
---
I’m getting a lot of the same ones but I think it’s because I go to the same workshops and do them a lot
---
But jokes aside I prefer the five minutes of sitting on my pip boy playing the game or being able to go grab a snack while I leave the event on. All that is required is bop the first group and the others don’t even bother
---
The sophomore album is usually the worst one, so to speak.  
---
I’m ambivalent about the whole Armor Ace board, and not big on camp building in general.  I’m really not into patriotic or commie themes, so this whole GI Joe pastiche is not my cup of tea.  Some players really seem to like it, so to each their own.
---
A season is only ten weeks, so I’ll just enjoy the challenges and hope that season 3 will be more interesting to me.
---
If only God Todd hear you...
---
Even more when you want to put chems, foods, backpack and 2 chests for jetpack change in the wheel !
---
I usually go smoke a cigarette during that “zen session” 
---
I don’t smoke in the house
---
1900 hours and I still have no idea why I’m still playing... Guess I have fun with it? All I do say in and day out is walk around, shoot stuff in the face, do events in hopes of getting rare stuff, maybe tinker with my house and outfits a bit.
---
Who cares about those people? I'd rather live than die
---
That’s a big yes zen session is smoke time
---
Gonna be even harder after next patch in afraid
---
That smoking is allowed in the house, just not the cigarettes
---
 I’d give you 420 upvotes if I could
---
Only savage divide events and any Mr. Messenger regardless of where he is
---
During the week i play with 8-12 others and we do what i call "nuka nomads". We jump on a server, bomb the hell out of it (3xACP &amp; 2xSBQ) and then move onto the next one. Like 3 times a day. On the weekends we are less people and are more into farming, vending, chilling in our camps, helping low levelers and just playing casual. I love it.
---
Vault 94 jumpsuit, proudly worn by commander
---
It was insane. After the nerf it’s not even worth mentioning.
---
Can’t wait for my morning zen session to start... hurry up Todd
---
Check the PTS forum.
---
I'm italian as well, but i prefer the english dub. Nothing wrong with the italian dub, except for fallout 4 where the ps4 version had terrible quality and everyone in bunker hill had an accent from romagna
---
Tbh. Marksman weapon do alot of dmg per bullet. But against hight health enermies. Most other builds are better for dps. My favorite character use to be my marksman with the levers. Still a great build for killing anything, but high health bosses. Lol. You could 1 shot the hoard wendigos that are surrounding np. 
---
Check out: (nukes and dragons) google it. it has build advice and others post their builds.
---
apply for a refund at MS or Sony 😂 say you accidently bought atoms 😂
---
It was nerfed to an insane degree
---
That said still better than T65 because anything over 350 resist is a waste due to diminishing returns
---
Forest jumpsuit - one of the rarest , atleast before the last dupe , Responders fireman outfit ? Travelling leathercoat ( that has backpack )
---
Never mind i read you mentioned them lol
---
Btw theres a clean straightjacket that a few years ago could be bought from the Responder bot
---
Quick! Fix this man's issue before he buys all of the recycled Atomic Shop content he's already paid for from previous Fallout games.
---
The seasons aren’t really tied to factions.  They’re more of a pastiche/homage to mid century American pop culture.  The Legendary Run was the Fallout version of Buck Rogers, and Armor Ace seems to be GI Joe.  I’m guessing we’ll eventually get a western/cowboy season, maybe something related to Grognak/Conan, and possibly something like Scooby Doo.
---
I just came across the Medical Goggles which I had never seen before and after showing them to a few people it sounds like they’re pretty rare. They’re BOS
---
I distinctly remember thinking of the Ghost People after encountering my first Mole Miners. Everything old is new again in video games, huh?
---
Trying for the impossible loot for the god tier weapons is why I end up quitting games like that (looking at you Borderlands and Diablo 3).  
---
I will say, the lack of freaking aluminum but the need for it in every gun repair is maddening.  Wtf don’t I get it when scrapping a weapon if it’s needed to repair the weapons???
---
Once I saw it on a player's vendor for a few thousand caps and I thought it was insane :( now I feel bad I haven't bought it
---
If you die in adventure mode can other players take your junk?
---
You’re much better off supplementing a secondary stat, like Int or End.  That way you’ll be adding to the stat and the ability to use more perk cards.
---
This is not the place for this
---
I just need those greenhouse walls.
---
Green Hood to complete the leather coat outfit and Wrapped Cap to complete the Tattered Field Jacket. 
---
Clean versions of the Ranger outfit and Ranger hat too
---
5 stimpacks
---
I think one of the problems is the lower levels don’t really frequent the message boards... at least until they’re into the game for a while. I didn’t use Reddit until my main was well over 100. And then again maybe they know what they have is shit and they’re just hoping you’ll hook them up.
---
Thanks! No that's great because it means we're both on the same page. It's interesting, the forest camo jumpsuit does seem to be very rare. I keep thinking about all of the forest camo jumpsuits that hsve been accidentally scrapped by low levels because of where it drops, lol.
---
I stopped accepting trade requests years ago
---
Oh boy, thanks for that information, didn't know about that. :/
---
Yeah, closed steam as well and even restarted my computer.
---
I've given up on gauss, back in the day with my TSE version, even today's two shot gauss is insane damage, but the 95% miss rate is so annoying even if you load into vats twice to "fix" it.
---
Leader bblehead was hard for me , couldn't find it anywhere even in player's vendors . One day day I was bleesed with it sitting on a desk in some shack
---
So.... your problem is that you have infinite amounts of money and you could buy literally anything in the atom shop? Right.
---
I can only guess that you might get technical data once in a while, since the commie bot has propaganda fliers and the raider bot collects chems.
---
Santatron collects a lot of toys, which contain lead.  I prefer Santa for that reason, but the BoSbot might collect gunpowder.  We’ll find out tomorrow.
---
Could also just give us a real respec option so this wouldn't be an issue, for christ sake.
---
Best bet is to spend some time on killing the 3* legendary and let it mutate (restore half health). I’ve noticed you are almost guaranteed a 3* loot drop in such case.
---
Oh great!  I'll find out where to get them. Thanks so much...actually I think I remember someone saying the medical goggles look really good with an outfit but I can't remember which one.
---
I like the idea of an ammo requisition reward for quests! It fits with their current change it dynamic ammo drop off enemies. I think we'd be more likely to see it as a standalone addition rather than something built around the converter though. And if they tried to work the converter into it, it would probably have balancing issues when it comes to ammo value.
---
I feel like this good be a hidden truth - there is quite a lot of Chinese Nationals that play this game. Bethesda is using playerbase marketing to its advantage.
---
I’m the same way, you’ve got a little time but I always try and revive my teammate before I engage with the person who downed them... rarely works out well 🤣🤣
---
ME TOOOOO LOL
---
For some reason PayPal takes longer for them to process the order. You broke the system when you cancelled the auto renewal. You can try opening a ticket with Bethesda customer support. Copy your email from PayPal with your order details and paste it in your ticket to Bethesda. You'll probably have to wait 1 to 2 weeks for it to get straightened out. Just long enough for you to get used to not having 1st anymore. 
---
PayPal does offer a refund but I haven't done that. Yet. Good Luck
---
Any of the scribe outfits but the best match is the science scribe! Pretty cool looking
---
Put paint on your gear, it will stop it being shown in the trade menu.
---
they do seem to be having some issues recently. apparently people have been getting a shit loads of atoms added to their account. Possibly disabled for now.
---
I've never had problems finding it, and if you supplement it with mama dolces finest meat stew it gets even better hahahah
---
Did u buy the raider culinary outfit too, I did ha ha
---
Oh yes! I forgot about the ranger stuff. Thanks:) I got the wrapped cap and I'm server hopping for the green hood now. I'm becoming sneaky friends with the ghouls at Danes compound, haha
---
I'm with u bud. I wish that they would show nw more love but it doesn't look like they will.
---
You must not be a gunslinger ...
---
From a technical standpoint, I don’t know how this would work.  It would probably take longer to search through all the several dozen poses on the emote wheel than it would take to open photo mode and do it that way.
---
That and the train set are all I want, but I'm not doing the daily grind again, so I guess too bad.  Might be able to get the train anyway.
---
The one thing I desperately need from Season 2, is that damn Model Train Set Table!
---
I toss 3 star crap on the ground because I get too much.
---
Do you even play?
---
Excellent!  I've got the science scribe, that would look so good  as a set on a mannequin. Thanks:)
---
So you want 3 star items to give less scrip then?  Because that is what you're saying.
---
Personally looking at the rewards for season 2... it ain’t worth anything (to me). I’ll honestly just play the game and ignore the challenges because the rewards are if I’m honest... ass. Red paint for armor? No thanks. Lot of shitty PA paint? No thanks. I’m personally not gonna bother with it. Which sucks because I love the game but I’m not gonna go out of my way for rewards I don’t care about.
---
Imo the only “cool” things in this season pass are the military floors and wallpaper. Everything else (besides the caps/gb/scrip obv) don’t look good.
---
Dude i eat people.
---
[Relevant thread on the Bethesda forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/426489/bug-energy-weapon-damage-miscalculation?language%5B%5D=en&amp;lang=en-US&amp;page=1), breaking down why energy weapons don't work properly.
---
Haha explosives and wood and cloth and cork
---
My god this would help so much
---
This game having problems seems to be a feature by now. Thanks for the reply. I wait one or two days, if nothing has happened by then, I'll open a ticket.
---
I've never failed it - I've solo'ed it a couple of times too. PA Heavy Gunner with a Vampires FFR minigun and Adrenaline. Kiss goodbye to your ammo stores though.
---
I’m talking about season design. There is no reason not to allow that week between seasons for people to claim things.
---
No. Who TF would want that? I'm asking for a higher daily scrip limit. Heck make it weekly if needs be
---
They aren't rare, I have to throw them away.  This is reddit, home of entitled whiny babies who bitch and moan that the things they're given for free isn't good enough and want to be given bloodied fixers just for logging in.
---
I bet the glass set and the BoS bunker will be available for purchase for bullion later on. Unlike Captain Cosmos stuff these items are just too big for both camp builders and the Brotherhood theme of this year to limit them to the Season.
---
But as there's no guarantee, it's best to try and get them now than wait and be disappointed later.
---
True, that could be it. Beth being Beth again, I guess.
---
If you not using power armor for this event, be sure to mod your chest armor with asbestos lining, you will not take any damage from the falling ambers. I'm  level 410 (don't use power armor), I done that even 6 times. The 1st 2 time I died so much I eventually got kicked outside (Bloodoed Build and didn't know what I was doing), next 2 times I managed to make it to the end only to die at the same time Earle dies because I happened to be standing at the entrance. Last 2 times I used sneak to get my shots in on Earle but also taking out the smaller wendigos. I was able to beat Earle with 1 other player, what I think is because it was only 2 of us there were alot less wendigos spawning than it would when there is a handfull of players there.
---
Only thing besides the greenhouse I want, but I doubt I'll get either.
---
Meh, you know that with Beth it is never at our advantage...
---
Make it 10 and you got a deal
---
That's a good way to look at it, even though your not going to be actively completing the board you will still pick up rewards just by playing, so its more of a bonus rather than an expectation.
---
Not exactly.... because a battle pass has a cost for entry. A battle pass you pay for the privilege to maybe earn rewards. They are similar but they are not the same thing. They are different ways of monetizing content.
---
Haha, as soon as I replied to you I hopped servers and there it was! You must be a luck bringer, I've been looking all day
---
Yes there is. The season ends on a set date. That’s it. Why would they leave it up for another week to collect stuff you should have collected weeks ago. They’ll take it down. And code in the next season in that week. If they added another week as your saying then you’d have people moaning that they want another week. It’s not a shock or surprise when it finishes.
---
There is no pass though..... you understand that right? A “pass” is another word for a ticket, a price for admission into the system.
---
I thought it was the reward for rank 79 but looking at it again the site says something About a red viper handmade skin... The picture just shows the blood eagle handmade skin from last season though.
---
15
---
No, but I love to see you double down here rather than admitting you were wrong. Just call it by it’s proper name. A battle pass is a different method of monetizing content where you buy a pass... that allows you entry into a path that you can maybe earn rewards. Without a pass... you cannot have a battle...pass...
---
Yo you must have 99 Luck
---
No u
---
Good idea but I have multiple weapons on me and I can't put a skin on some of them :/ but I'll try
---
10? 10 whole Stimpacks? Are you 'avin a laugh, pal? 
---
get a load of this guy! Wants TEN stimpacks for a croc backpack plan. What a clown. It's not april 1st you chancer!
---
Yeah, but this time the enemy's health bar is just 5 percent left and she's in front of me opening her pipboy 🤣🤣🤣
---
: D
---
If it exclusively dropped cork to fill the hole left in stash boxes after the collection event, I would never remove him from my camp.
---
So you keep logging into farm it. Aluminum is one of those things I'll almost always buy from player and/or NPC vendors as caps aren't too hard to accumulate, especially now that I'm not really looking for weapons to purchase anymore.
---
After p22 goes live, it’s going to be much harder to take out enemies with single headshots, at least when you’re dealing with lvl 75-100 enemies.  Full auto is the only way to move through quests efficiently.  If you like fighting the mutants outside Westek for a solid 10-15 minutes, go rifleman.  If you want the pace of the current live game, play commando.  You will get overrun by ghouls at the golf club with a semi auto rifle.
---
I love sniping with a high damage bloody sniper rifle, but between the new damage math and stronger enemies, I’m converting to commando.  I’m pretty bummed, but rifleman doesn’t make a meaningful contribution in end game events and Daily Ops on the PTS.  It’s either commando or heavy guns, possibly shotgun.  Everything else is a mile behind.
---
Lazy bastards...what I do generally is run it solo in A habitat. Fast travel as soon as the event pops up then clear all rooms (to avoid unnecessary enemies when your animal decides to run different habitat) then start the terminal rush to A and kill all those radstags and 9/10 times it’s 3/3. Everything is easy until the sheepsquatch comes which needs all the attention and the animal runs and gets surrounded by ants/honey beasts and wolfs while you take out the sheepsquatch.
---
U only need to get to 97. Then buy the remaining 3 levels and you’ll get 500 atoms so end up 50 atoms up
---
Um I'm just gonna say no to whatever you were trying to get through there😂
---
Oh wow, I didn’t even catch that and I even watched it a few times. Yeah I would’ve engaged. Had I noticed, I may not have noticed myself
---
Welcome to 1980 and mobs dropping random loot.
---
Maybe you should pick a different genre of game to play than one that has been defined by a mechanic for over 40 years that you don't like?
---
We’re u standing under the canopy bit where u drop in sniping him because it’s safe there?
---
Yeah it’s a bonus to my normal play routine. Like I’ll check them sure to see if there are any in close to completing or something, but I won’t go out of my way to do NW challenges or anything like that.
---
I’m honestly HOPING that we’ll get a real BoS one for S3(?) when the rest of the story comes out for them. As I’ve always loved military-esque stuff and that “should” be a lot of military style stuff.
---
And then you'd just bitch about how rare 3 star monsters are.
---
Completed it with a level 12 and 18 the other day. U must have some terrible luck with players in the event. Only time I’ve failed is when it crashed.
---
You can easily solo SBQ with a bloody rifleman build on the live game.  Sniper rifles and semiauto receivers are hot trash on the PTS, though.
---
It would be great to see perk coins as a reward for completing challenges past level 100 on the legendary run.
---
Still this change is great and means everyone will at least get the chance to have a levelled legendary perk.
---
Seemed so confused by what they were seeing that they opened fire on the ground for a second LMAO.
---
I don't blame you
---
Do you listen to your screaming 2 year old demanding cake for dinner?
---
No, they're idiots.
---
I already explained why they should allow you to claim after you stop being able to earn rewards. The season is about being able to complete challenges. Everyone knows you stop earning score sept 8. Earning score and claiming your prize don’t need to be connected on the exact same time table. There is no harm in allowing a grace period to claim rewards lol. That’s just poor design.
---
I’m on mobile and I didn’t watch it in the Imgur app originally. Yeah I could see if she’s on her pip-boy now
---
I need to know more about mole miners but I hope they retain some mystery. They're a cool part of 76 unique to Appalachia and I'd hate for their mysterious nature to be ruined by learning too much too quickly
---
I don't know how anyone can call spending a few minutes a day doing extremely easy challenges for free stuff a "grind".   This is hands down the easiest battle pass i have ever had to complete for any game in terms of raw playtime.  Many challenges take only a few seconds and many others only a couple minutes.
---
This is still a problem for me. It’s been weeks and it’s still not fixed
---
It clearly says claim before the end. It’s not rocket science. The event ends. It’s done. I finished it a couple weeks back and don’t play loads. From memory the last 5 levels, at least, are all skins and camp stuff right. Not gold or scrip so there’s absolutely no reason to have not collected everything by the end of the event.
---
You’re going to want to pick one or the other once One Wasteland goes live.  Without min/maxing, regular scorchbeasts are going to laugh at you.
---
We’ve wanted it for years now, didn’t the game start out like this and switch to a random starred item after?
---
I don't know what BoS theme they could do for armor though unless they release all new "immediately post war" PA and armor skins, I have all the skins from the Tech drop quests,  
---
New weapon skins, clothing, camp cosmetics would be great though.
---
Some people just get pissy about the dumbest stuff. ITS JUST A FRICKIN' GAME. If they don't like doing an event with low level players then maybe they should get a private server and do events by them damn selves. Hell, I have a private server but I spend 99% of the time on the public one (guess I waisted my $100). Those type people can ruin your game play. This game already has enough issues we have to deal with as is.
---
You don’t feel cool after sinking three .50 into a level 100 mutant head before it dies.  It just feels slow and inefficient.
---
Are there not perks already that buff during the day and night?
---
It’s still poor design... whether they clearly state it in a tweet or not. 
---
Again, if you design something that has the possibility for someone to earn a reward and then be locked out of claiming it... that is poor design. 
---
If you can’t see that, I don’t know what to tell you. Maybe you just like to argue.
---
Simply put: YOU DESERVE IT!
---
you more of a chance the sun won't rise tomorrow then bethesda not making bank off whales buying it all out day one
---
Or 500 atoms... wait
---
I dunno, there are plenty of tacky red, white and blue power armour skins there too.  I'm just interested in the camp items from this season. Some interesting stuff there.  Cosmetic skins in this game are trash for the most part. Most of the coolest outfits are the rare, in game spawns
---
XP farm event, I only do that event when I want to kill a bunch ... fast
---
LOL.
---
It's still a battle-pass dude. 100 tiers. Big/long grind, but this one is free! What did it cost us? Our daily/weekly atom challenges.
---
You might be the type of person to agree with EA when they say that the Suprise Mechanics are not loot boxes.
---
Sorry we’re gonna have to agree to disagree. Nobody is locked out of claiming a reward. There’s an end date. Well publicised and broadcast with plenty of heads up. If u haven’t claimed the things you’ve earned by that date then it’s on you.
---
Why listen. you still play.
---
Didn’t read this whole essay but I don’t like seasons and what they do to gameplay.
---
I like the bonus health regen you get plus a guaranteed legendary in the first group to attack bridge. Plus 2 treasury notes
---
You won’t be melting any bosses with that thing, for better or worse.  It doesn’t have magic effects.  It’s worth 15 scrip, though.
---
Different monetization method. Nuance matters. Can’t have a battle pass without a cost of entry. It’s as simple as that.
---
Thanks.
---
I do it because my shotgun is a pea shooter to Earle but I still want the rewards.
---
Yeah I have all of those as well. I always rock my T-60 armor because of it. Plus I personally love the way T-60 looks so there’s that as well. But I know.. I’m just hoping for something better I guess. 
---
I know it’s impossible to please everyone and i haven’t looked at other posts about the rewards to see if I’m in the minority or not about the rewards being... disappointing?
---
The grind comes from "thinking" you have to change your play style, or by pushing yourself over the limit because FOMO.  
---
It was grindey for me as I was having to do challenges I didn't want to do because I thought I would need to do every challenge to complete the board, when Gameplay becomes a job it becomes grind.  
---
I've never done a "battle pass" before so as my first one I learnt a lot.
---
it's literally the fallout 1/2 bunker........
---
fine Bethesda you win i'll play more
---
I already explained a situation where someone would be locked out. Allowing that is bad design...UX is central to success of any product. 
---
How do you consider it well publicized? Because it’s listed in the Bethesda forums? Did it say this when people first logged into the legendary run because I don’t remember seeing that.
---
Why not?  When you get injured, you start doing more damage.  If you run a lot of mutations, which I recommend, you should be using Class Freak.  Losing 12hp is nothing.
---
I hope so, I think the place where we play nuclear winter is a simulation
---
Yeah in the rad I know, but the environment is cool, story it's tragic like the others
---
The enemies inside the Burrows don’t drop flux stabilizers.  They just become glowing variants.
---
The end date has always been there. It ends when the spaceship reaches 100. It moves one space a day. And your situation is someone finishing the level 100 10 seconds before the event ends. It’s nonsense.  Plenty of warning. I’m not on now but what kevel was the last level that had gold/scrip to collect? 90?  That’s the only things u could realistically claim u didn’t want to claim as you were full.
---
No you can't.  If you do the math you'll see that you need to do all 5 challenges and weeklies in roughly 80/100 days (few days fewer if you do NW) and that's including 2 XP weeklies per play session.  That is impossible to do in 5 min a day, especially when you  consider we were getting bonus challenges almost the entire last season, and there's no reason to expect that we will get them this time.        
---
There are multiple challenges that you cannot complete by themselves in 5 min or less let alone all of the ones available.  Leveling up takes more than 5 min even if you have a new character, killing x legendaries takes more than 5 min, claiming x workshops or completing x events takes more than 5 minutes... there may be others I'm not thinking about, and you will get at minimum 2 of these a day, and quite possibly all 4.    
---
I would say the quickest you could complete all the non level up challenges would be like 10 min IF you got only one of the ones that take 10+ min itself, then when you consider the fact that if you fail to do the level up challenge you not only won't be getting the highest reward challenge completed, you will also be missing out on the "complete 5 challenges" 250, because there won't be extra challenges this time around.  It's the level up or the NW, and even the easiest NW till take like 10 min because that's how long it takes to queue up.    
---
Sorry, but 5 min a day is nowhere near what you would need to do.
---
It's not free, though.  It requires your daily, or nearly daily time.
---
They already did, twice!
---
From what i've read last 2 days, almost everyone is complaining about something, that's why I did this post.  
---
A cool camp item would be one of the tanks you could use it as a tent.
---
Would be nice if it weren't for the fact that that's like half of what you would have gotten under the old system.  :/
---
1000-2000atoms ..500 is joke
---
Yes another one of my favorites is not fast traveling when you’re supposed to fast travel. Always keeps you on your toes
---
I’m stuck also, tried different suggestions and ... stuck :(
---
some of us have no need for caps or bullion anymore tbh
---
Ah super interesting, some of the wall hanging items are effected and some are not it seems
---
my friend runs one of those auto grenade launchers because he loves it so i just dump all explosive ammo his way, otherwise id never touch the stuff, so weighty
---
i think it helps that the game doesn't make killing people worth it and if people do want to kill eachother there is a mode for it
---
I don’t understand why you even need to claim atom shop items and atoms. 
---
It’s poor design. Maybe you don’t know what I mean when I say design. 
---
Since you think it’s not poor design, can you explain to me why... from a design perspective... you need to even go into the board and claim atoms or other atomic shop items that are account wide?
---
Y'all complain if lowbies don't touch the spawns, y'all complain if lowbies do touch the spawns. What do you want??
---
Xbox - thanks for asking though!
---
They sure can. The only other exception to this is after SBQ but before fast-traveling away - you still drop your regular junk and players can take it, but the stable flux you receive as a reward will cease to exist.
---
That's what I was saying in the post, they don't really need to do anything to your gameplay, you play the game as you want to, and the challenges complete themselves as you play.  
---
Personally in the new season, i'm going to incorporate the challenges into my gameplay, and not worry about missing a couple,  rather than what I did last season, which was to log on do all the challenges as fast as possible and log off again, because that really did ruin my gameplay.
---
They can keep those repair kits
---
I wear the V94 jumpsuit when I pop out of power armor.  It’s one of the very few items that was kind of a struggle to get, impossible to just buy from someone else, and very few players have.  
---
It’s also a good thing to have on when someone offhandedly comments and assumes you just bought your Strangler Heart suit with bullion instead of putting in an xxl grind.
---
Before those get implemented they'd have to get rid of the current max limits of those currencies. Imagine being at 20-30k caps which is typically what I hover around and getting the 30k prize and 20k+ just disappearing into the void.
---
Can be applied to any capped currency.
---
"....plus new Weekly challenges to provide flexibility so you can rank up on your own schedules ."    
---
I wonder how this will differ from regular weeklies.  If I don't have to log on every day, that fixes my only (and deal breaker) complaint about seasons.
---
power armor skin when nobody using powerarmors sounds better?
---
It’s ‘you’re’, but fair enough. I’m just echoing advice given to me when I returned to the game a few months back. I see above a comprehensive breakdown from another poster which disputes this however, so I’m happy to admit I was wrong in this case.
---
I agree, as they quit the daily and weekly challenges for atoms, they reduced a lot our ways to get atoms without having to spend real money, they should at least give 1500 or 2000 atoms for reaching level 100, I mean it was after a lot grinding.
---
you can claim it when you spending all caps. No brain would claim it when you have limit. Can be applied to existing caps scrip already in this run and next.
---
I'm 100+ and UF seems to always give me lv. 35/40 weapons.  They end up being pretty useless other than scrip.
---
Their original pitch as you could complete challenge by doing things you already do in the game. They failed to live up to that if you ask me.
---
Patriotism.
---
Wait until p22 goes live.  Your guns will behave differently with the new math.  I have a strong suspicion that anti armor will become much more valuable.
---
On that u have a point. Shouldn’t have to claim anything except stuff like gold and scrip. But there’s not a single reason to have not collected those items every time u level up. It’s only gold and scrip u could have any argument for leaving uncollected. And with a decent amount of heads up there’s no reason u can’t spend what u have to make space for the rewards.
---
nobody uses power armour?
---
You really can't argue how atrocious RNG is in the game.  You should be able to acquire at least your ideal weapon on your own.
---
Judging by the rewards, absolutely not.
---
when you dont need caps and other things like you say. you probably end-gaming so you already know power armors are not powerful and using them only for cosmetic roleplaying purpose...
---
I wish there was more natural ground camp objects. That suit just being on grass or whatever. Everything's always household items. I want some more trees and shit that looks like it'd be in a camp. Not a house.
---
Good work bruv
---
I already explained a single reason why someone may not be able to claim. Maybe they completed their last challenge  right before they had to log off, maybe they were in the middle of fighting earl when the timer expired. It’s poor design.
---
Well either your teammate was blind or he had the challenge of "revive a teammate" so he wanted to complete it at any cost, never thought about it was easier to just shoot the enemy who was in front of him and watching a pipboy. XD
---
Enclave events do not
---
how is like 20 minutes to get daily challenges done everyday for over 2 months not enough time?
---
I dont accept trading with lowbies... they always ask for the gud stuff
---
I'm tired of the animations to do things on crafting objects. Just bring up the options when I click it. Oh and don't lag everytime I make something. Thx Todd.
---
nah mate, go to the terminals connected to them, change them to .38 and then empty them
---
The defense on T-65 is possibly 1% better than Strangler in practical application, so any amount of damage that Strangler adds is going to be better.  1% extra damage is better than 1% defense in this game.
---
I have a lvl 35 version. Slowest most useless rare weapon I own now that I traded away my BSSS Cultist blade.
---
This
---
i did it at level 17 so you should be more then good
---
And a 3 star enemy still can't drop the really good legendaries like a Fixer or gold bullion gear.
---
The terminals were all locked. Dude was a lvl 52, with 8 ammo factories in the top floor of his camp. They were all producing both 10mm and .556.
---
Ghosts, once some nutjob goes public people see them everywhere.
---
It might takes time because not a lot of people likes NW mode.
---
Well you got commie BLM and commie Antifa rioting right now, making it look like a tiny fringe minority is far bigger than it is, thanks to commie Dimocrat mayors and governors supporting them in the hopes that it will somehow hurt Trump, while the bodies and burned husks of buildings continue to pile up.
---
So now Hollywood is cancelling cop shows even to the point of some companies possibly bankrupting themselves and video game companies are removing cops and other law enforcement from games, even retconning old ones.
---
Bethesda probably has a couple commies working there, or they think it's a more popular thing than it is.
---
If my leisure time hobbies were stressing me out, I’d find find something else to do.
---
now if only they‘d adress the issue that when you open a perk card pack and it gives you a rank 1* card you already have, it doesn‘t actually get added. so, depending on your level, you missed out on a looooot of points.
---
I agree with you they failed in that aspect, not that you can't complete the challenges during normal gameplay (you can if you incorporate into your gameplay), they just made assumptions about how people play the game that weren't universal enough...    
---
The build challenges were particularly annoying, you need to build 5 of this and 5 of that "normal gameplay" excuse me Bethesda, I built my camp months ago, I like it as it is thank you very much..  (Luckily I have found a great trick to do with building challenges that also really helped with minimising the automatic pvp in workshops)  
---
And NW jeebers no thank you, I don't like PvP in any case but thinking I had to do every challenge made me play it.  Something luckily I wont ever be doing again.
---
3" enemies don't actually drop the ones where plans are required. Those only come from the Purveyor and some public events that use the same loot table as the Purveyor.
---
What free trial? afaik there is no free trial atm.
---
buy everything. the BOS bot comes in today I think
---
Whats worse is the standard weapon balance is still screwed. My cousin hasn't been able to play since the derecho hit Iowa, been almost and entire month no internet, half a month no power. Felt bad for him so been grinding his accounts score to get some of the stuff he was hoping to get.
---
His build is... A mess, I mean the game is far more restrictive than 4 was and thats the one he has most time in. But even so a anti armor handmade does far more damage with 10 rounds then a 50 cal rifles 10, which is 6 slow cocking then reload before 4 more chambered rounds. The higher we got and spongier enemies became im seeing why he was frustrated now. Unless he rolls some god tier hunting rifle without changing his build to a stealth one its then weapons that shouldn't be as good at sniping will still out pace a sniper rifle because an enemy can close the gap in only a few shots even at great distances.
---
In other words f your playstyle heres the meta follow it or that gun is useless.
---
I've been playing about 1 hour every day for 6 months and I am level 48. So thats about 400 hours  just my estimate to get to level 100. Most are probably better players than me though.
---
You know, if the cost to buy one from the purveyor went down as well (still 40% return) is take the city in value. 
---
20 scrip but you can buy for 50 would be good- plus it assists with max scrip without actually raising the limit
---
I had the same thing happen yesterday. I thought it was messed up so I bought out the shop and used some to advance the final few board spaces in the legendary run. And now I can't log in.
---
Feels like they made the ammo converter shifty on purpose out of spite. 
---
"Oh, you want a way to exchange ammo, do you? Well suck on this!"
---
We definitely need a higher script limit plus on caps and bullion’s we shouldn’t have a cap tbh it’s ridiculous really we should be able to carry as much caps etc as we want. How many guns/armour I drop daily because I can’t sell it for scrips or my vendor can’t hold more
---
Nope I was sneaking around him shooting his head.. There is a couple "safe" spots but there's still a chance Earle will get you with his acid spray or whatever it is.. Pro tip: asbestos lining on you chest piece will make you negate the falling flame debris damage
---
That guy is legally blind
---
I'm new, so what your telling me is all my storage and stuff can be stolen when not at camp?
---
I reckon at every earle and sbq event at least 75% of the people there are wearing PA. 
---
Often it's just me in armour.
---
I usually only request a trade cause some people usually have a ton of chems and stims on them so I just buy them all up. I never trade with randoms in game
---
Theres a slight change to playstyle (the build ones can be done in a workshop btw - just capture one and throw down the 5x walls etc), but you can get by with normal play + minor change (e.g save your bubblegum, or pick some plants as you run past them)
---
It collects rare plans and weapons, then refuses to give them to you.
---
Its the near winning strategy. Ive gotten stuck on world geometry several times and cant move. Generally did well. Frees up time to do chores while waiting for the round to end.
---
Also got distracted by something away from my system and came back to find an 8 minute survival time from being afk.
---
The winning strategy seems to be to not play as intended, showing how broken it is.
---
For some reason Bethesda is obsessed with communist stuff, that’s all they ever flood the atom shop with
---
just stuff in collectors, ammo makers and resource gathering thingies.
---
Reading my tag, I concur.
---
i have exact opposite experience. 90% players are stealth commando on PC. Sometimes there is power armor player with legacy plasma.    but we talk only about one /two events, another 99% of game is better without powerarmor
---
I'm looking forward to it too, I'm leveling up a new character so all the aid rewards will go to them.
---
One word: sneak.
---
I got stuck in an outhouse when my quick select wheel froze. I came in either 2nd or 3rd I think.
---
Hi, just wonder if you figured out what’s the reason for that inferior damage “feeling ” (not sure if you did any quantitative tests) Recently I acquired one bloodied/faster firing mini, and found the exactly same issue, the faster firing one feels not outputing as much dps as my old bloodied (increase DR while reloading ) mini, even though I have the same mods on both guns, tested on the same targets, without adrenaline buff kicking in.
---
you don't loose the buffs you can loose on death either
---
On what?
---
Check my profile for a little video of the end of my semi soloing Earle to see how are do things
---
I loath nuclear winter but I kinda wanna make it to level 100 just so I can adventure around in the vault and learn stuff.
---
I agree with how you view the grind for sure. Its been taxing knowing that we SHOULD be participating since its this easy
---
If they refuse to change something the apparent majority is pointing out as a terrribly designed system, then yes they aren't listening. 
---
They can disagree all they want, we see it for wat it really is.
---
Ah, seems fair and fun in its way ty for the input
---
Not your storage, but any lockable resource (like water purifiers) can be taken if you leave it unlocked. For example, I keep several purifiers up for adhesive farming, but I'll leave at least one unlocked for people who are thirsty. The ammo factories aren't supposed to be able to be built ( it's a feature at the ammo factory workshop in the northeast). Because they are glitched you can lock the attached terminal, but the storage portion remains open. I'm not morally outraged about people using the glitch, but it's fun to leave a bag of poop to send a message.
---
pretty big cop out if/when they do. Seriously not enough rewards worth playing for in this next season and obviously the halfway decent greenhouse walls are at the end fml
---
I know that now :) and I came up with an idea that helped me minimise pvp at workshops at the same time as i'm completing the build challenges.  
---
And I have been spending my time the last couple of weeks (since I finished the board) working out ways of incorporating the challenges into my "normal" daily play style and with the exception's of NW and Levelling up i'm pretty fly at enjoying the game and completing the challenges at the same time.  Without feeling the grind.
---
I used to have this until one day my camp glitched on login, never appeared or gave me any type of message. Panicked and immediately logged off and on 3 times and then turned the game off for a few weeks lol
---
I guess their reasoning is probably “if you don’t ask you don’t get”. I personally don’t take an issue with someone asking as long as they’re prepared for the inevitable refusal.
---
I’d still chance it and buy everything in the atom shop. It’s not like it’s a real bank error. If your balance goes to zero it’s still probably worth it and I doubt it would go negative
---
and switch blade
---
nope
---
this link has info on how to get plans and mods

---
it's apparently a very rare chance it appears at certain vendors. I cannot remember where i got mine.
---
What? I play on PC too &amp; the heavy hitters are all PA heavies. Stealth commandos certainly contribute but unless they're top tier or bugged, they don't have the sustained DPS the PA heavies do.
---
I have an aluminum resource at my camp that is not locked if you are on ps4
---
No, the plan must be purchased from robot vendor in Ash Heap, Mire or Cranberry Bog, the plan have 0.43% chance to appear in those robot vendor, alternatly you have a little chance to find it in player vendor.
---
my bffr gat plasma  has literally been shooting green fire , as if its a flamer. and my flamer is shooting bullets.
---
I'm almost 50 years old bubba. This low drop rate, slot machine bullshit is endemic of modern live service games. It exist to have little birds pecking at buttons hoping that they'll get seeds.
---
One Westland algorithm in action ; p
---
You can put locks on your stuff don't worry.
---
The locks can be broken but it makes the person wanted and everyone on the map can see you. 
---
No biggie but funny watching noobs chase you through the Bog when you have speed demon and marsupial mutations on.
---
Yeah under the canopy is safe until he dies. Then it’s insta death as it collapses. Always use the asbestos lining on the chest and once he gets to last bit of health I take a radaway and boost to 60% health. Kill him. Run out and before I leave swap to chinese stealth. Walk out of the storm. Swap back and walk back into the storm to drop my rads to 19% again. Works a treat
---
Yup, gotta be a huge wanker to lock off machines but leave them powered on.
---
Everything else is shit, so asking for something that isn't is unreasonable?
---
I don't much care for the extra Legendary Cards, im going to rebalance all my points to have 10 and use all the Special Legendary Cards to make me 15 across the board. Im keeping Strenght at 15 and adding 5 just to get the extra 25 pounds.
---
If it helps, the build challenges featured the same things.
---
It was always a mix of: 
---
5x Floors/Walls/Roofs/Stairs.
---
10 x Water/crops
---
20x Lights
---
5x floor or wall decorations
---
5 x displays.
---
So in one workshop build a god awful abomination of floors, stairs, lights etc that fufils all the criteria of any combination. Then blueprint it.
---
Next time the challenge comes up just slap the blueprint down and it will complete the challenge regardless of which combination of items it is.
---
what part of brb do you not get?
---
"....we got fun and games".
---
Big fan of the Junk Theme. 10/10 would visit.
---
Sorry disagree. That’s a nonsense. If u leave it to the last second expect to get screwed. Most people have finished it well within the time anyways and as I said the only things u wouldn’t insta claim are gold and scrip which I think are 7 or 8 levels from the end so plenty of warning when it ends.
---
Idk why you'd report that.
---
Oh if you're on xbox i can give you one. I have 4.
---
I'm on xbox if ya want to get some reliable help
---
They should just allow you to apply any combat skin to the Fixer and then come out with more combat rifle skins.
---
Take my free award brøthër
---
Screwing your players isn’t exactly good practice in my opinion lol. 
---
Just look at this sub, a lot of people are still working on rewards. A lot of people won’t finish the run. They should have time to claim rewards after season ends.
---
Hate SB and the bear things. Now I blitz them in a couple of seconds. Kinda to easy.
---
Player A is me.  I am at level 397 and have always been a heavy armor build.  I switch between big guns, shot guns and melee only because S in SPECIAL gives me that flexibility.  Its my bet that it is the Commando Builds who are complaining the most as they limited unless they move a bunch of their perk cards.  I have 80 perks after leveling up and have not opened a perk pack in the last 200 levels just waiting for the new legendary card system to become active.
---
Sorry there been plenty of time. It’s not screwing players. There’s a time limit. It’s no secret. So if u don’t complete or leave it till the last second then it’s on the player not Bethesda.
---
I move that we only refer to it as Paw Patrol henceforth.
---
So true, lol  I placed a curse shovel in the ice machine at white springs and some other stuff. Saw a low level and directed him to the machine. He was happy and I am no longer o er encumbered. Win win
---
So it isn’t working for you now?
---
Are your atoms still there?
---
I sold the plan for 1 cap. Someone revived me during the ACP escape (we both failed to escape in the end) so i felt they deserved something in return.
---
If a video game is impacting your mental health maybe stop playing it?
---
Thank you bröther.
---
1% or a 3% chance with luck of 10 or higher
---
Are you playing on console?
---
That will go straight  into  the trash  bin, as its part of the game.... don,t let your self get mugged in the wasteland
---
Children of Atom liked that
---
My ally wears the responder fireman’s outfit with sheepy head and I wear the camo suit with forest mask
---
What is a formal warning? Lol, like “hey, don’t spend our money, or we will ban you?”
---
So I dont get banned for having 3.6 million atoms that weren't paid for.
---
Idk really I launch the game and it says free trial is over purchase game to continue in the appalachia
---
Yeah
---
just checked and she's got the goods for me on xbone
---
Do you have or have you ever purchased Fallout 1st?
---
Platform?
---
Have you tried changing servers or restarting the app?
---
I play on PS4 and was just buying 3* armor off her a minute ago
---
Honestly I would take that over the current situation. At least then I know I get 3* stuff from 3* enemies....
---
The range on them is abysmal too.
---
I like my legacy explosive laser weapons. I have TSE and FE laser rifles with beam splitters attached and the FE is automatic; both do incredible damage with the right perk, serum, and chem load out. I also have a VE laser gatling that is useful at SBQ fights. Apparel-wise, I don't wear a lot of rare stuff because I generally don't like the look. I got that rare jumpsuit/scout mask mega-drop from an event a while back and I like having them, but I don't wear them.
---
I personally think the rewards are worthwhile in context of course..  
---
Not everyone is going to like all the cosmetics, which I think is a fair thing to say, so the real contention in my mind about the rewards is whether the nerf to the Atoms from getting rid of the daily challenges, is compensated for with the rewards you get from the Season's board.  
---
I believe that this board gives you just shy of 2000 atoms on completion whereas the dailies would have given you around 6000 (I don't know the exact numbers forgive me), but you also get  caps, script, direct bullion (rarer than gold for the casual player), perk cards (going to be massive soon with the legendary perk system), aid kits and repair kits (atom store purchase).  
---
In my opinion they compensate fairly for the loss of the atoms even though atoms would give you the freedom to spend as you want.  I also don't see it beyond the bounds of reasonable logic, that Bethesda may make Legendary Coins part of the tier 100 prize in future seasons.  
---
And of top of collecting all that you pick up some free/bonus cosmetics along the way, I don't think that's bad at all.
---
I agree that refusing to change something that the apparent majority don't want is a poor decision. Whether or not they disagree with if it should be changed, as you'll see me express my feelings on the topic in another post just a couple down.
---
 The Current system as it stands makes no sense and is punitive at best, for no good reason, but just because they are making a bad decision doesn't mean they aren't listening.  Insisting that the problem is they aren't listening dilutes the actual problem and makes it so that it will never find a solution. 
---
The problem is they have made a decision and they have chosen to stick with it even if it's a bad decision for some reason.  If they were just not listening then it's possible that they wouldn't even understand it was a bad decision, but they have listened and are well aware that it's bad decision and are choosing to stick to it. That's why they keep implementing compromises. 
---
To that end I fully agree that we need to make our voices heard on the topic and make sure they understand that we are not happy with their choice to stick with a bad decision, but giving them the benefit of assuming they aren't even aware it's a bad decision doesn't do the cause of pointing out our dissatisfaction any good
---
Yeah... That's why the game went from a mixed PvE/PvP to be 95% PvE &amp; no longer has PvP survival mode...
---
Part of the game... Sure bud.
---
Nothing I said justified or excused the behavior. 
---
I’m a proponent of Free Speech. Yet I despise the Westboro Baptist Church’s actions. I do not excuse or defend their behavior. 
---
This is no different.
---
So Bethesda knows little about so called CRM, client relationship management
---
My friend just lost his legacy laser because he painted it...
---
Successfully complete every single time without dying.
---
Wo0o0o......big man.
---
Ok great thanks ☺️ betting on the fact they will get pushed back though 🤣
---
value is high?
---
It affects all builds proportionately. Builds will mostly stay at the same power level relative to other builds like they are now.
---
The match finder seems flakey, if it hasnt found a match in a minute or two, i cancel it and try again and it usually finds a match fairly quickly.
---
That's how I've been playing the event for months now, mostly solo. What's nice is that you can sit on that roof near the bridge speaker and decide to either A) chill for eight minutes, or B) take potshots at the ghouls assembling on that platform just within weapon range (best with a crit shot or an explosive round with splash damage) that will aggro that group and make it run towards you. You will have all the time in the world to take them down before they reach you, and they won't be able to really hurt you if they slip through because you had to reload.
---
Just don't camp on one of the higher roofs, or they'll just run away out of weapon range.
---
Second: Lode Baring is a close second. Go there, kill the mole miners outside of the mine, hit the button, and chill for five or six minutes. No need to ever enter the mine, score three treasury notes, and you'll even get claim tickets for free.
---
Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there lived a radiated human. But this wasn’t just any radiated human. This was a very special human because they hacked a .50 cal with a beam spreader. This made the person so special that all the Fallout gods come down from heaven, and they complimented the person on their super cool very normal guns, and never mentioned how these losers ruin lobbies and should be perma-banned.
---
Fireworks are currently great, not in the next patch though...
---
Also usually  you get your atoms a few days after payment, at least I do  anyway
---
I know, hence why I stated the possible chances without including the ones which require the plans. :)
---
Lol... I love stuff like that. I’ll say things ironically like “watch it with the frisky language” in a stern voice and it’s usually at least confusing enough to make people stop talking.
---
Can one of you link a screenshot for the Fallout 76 version because I can't find it anywhere
---
What I usually do.  When I’m just doing random events and just strolling about I’ll stick to my rifleman perks.  
---
If I’m going to do endgame events I’ll swap to my commando cards.
---
&gt; I'm 100+ and UF seems to always give me lv. 35/40 weapons. They end up being pretty useless other than scrip.
---
Which will be resolved in one wastelanders.
---
But - I could go on.  I have so many 3 star legendaries sitting there to script - I just struggle to agree with the idea that they are rare.
---
(and I've been playing for 2 months)
---
get a grip.
---
The Two-Shot Broadsider: Scalable solutions for modern problems.
---
Scorched earth gives a few at random. 
---
I always nuke places that give a lot of the flora I am after. And then nuke Morgantown or white springs to farm hardened mass/glowing mass/high radiation fluids.
---
You can look up where each nuked flora grows most. Cranberry bog (Scorched earth location) is great for violet, another i forget which, and is okay for crimson.
---
so in theory the rifle build will be able to deal the same amount of damage as a command?
---
No and I’ve downvoted you as well. There is no downvoting.
---
Yes it dropped from the Christmas presents. so it should be very easy to get.
---
No idea, they told individuals that they could have been banned (under T’s &amp; C’s an exploit) &amp; to consider this a formal warning. So many people were gifted Crowns that to ban those who spent them would have meant banning half their player base &amp; of course that would have meant losing ESO plus revenue (FO1st equivalent. It’s fucking fake currency that you spend on shitty skins, Bethesda treat it like the Brinks Robbery.
---
I have them in mine for 15-20 caps I think and they are slow to sell even at that price so good luck for whoever tries 1000
---
well, that just depends on the person, personally I'd keep a black powder weapon unless I don't have the storage
---
Google says "This indicates the Free Trial event has concluded. If you have recently acquired the game and get this message, make sure you exit entirely out of the launcher on Steam or Bethesda.net and try again. Fallout 76 does not support Steam Family Share."
---
It dropped from the Christmas presents so getting if for caps from another player would be the best bet for getting it.
---
What platform you on I’d happily trade you the ones I get I feel I get them often
---
This isn’t quite the same then, seems to have only affected a slight few, and the generated atoms is immense. So ban/revert seems very possible
---
Could you be looking at a filtered category?
---
Ah unfortunately I’m on Xbox. Good luck in getting those black powders.
---
Lies, you cant in power armor you will die unless you spamming rad away every few seconds.
---
if only cross-platform trading existed
---
No, *relative* each will be less powerful, but the difference between them is the same.
---
For starters, this isn't destiny 2.
---
Yeah I just snagged some from a bot at a train station this morning.  Screws are pretty elusive too.  I’m still every game though so my weapons break fast and they’re the crappy ones you get at the beginning of the game like the pump action shotgun and the hunting rifle.  I only have about an hour a day to play, so server hopping to farm resources isn’t really an option or else that’s all I’d do.
---
They should but I encounter 3 stars far to frequently in the world it’s ridiculous. Now the 3 star gear you get from a colossal problem has been nothing but solid so far even after 50 runs.
---
I'm not good at pvp but I excel at hide-and-seek. Work with what you have.
---
I agree with everything except the 2-week morotorium. I kind of liked that.
---
The anti armor has that good magic. Plus anti armor in general just shreds
---
Hey mate only read the title but you can buy certain items with gold bilion at the various traders hope this helped
---
it indeed is silly, but then again if you where to slam on the breaks mid air like that i'm sure a lot of your blood would rush to your legs.. so it is "realistic" to an extent
---
That is top tier strat if you want an easy event. I had a bug that was a godsend on it when the rubble collapsed I’d died but instead of Spawning me at the entrance or outside it spawned me inside the rubble letting me get my junk bag back.
---
Another good one is breach and clear always good lead or and cap haul if you seek the stuff you pick up during the event from the miners. No treasury notes tho
---
Then you have the answer on your screen.
---
The free party is over, time to pay.
---
Who cares he’s a godless commie pinko
---
No. All the changes do to my knowledge is clip the upper end so the gap between the top and bottom won't be as wide. 
---
So if commando rifle did more than rifleman rifle before, it'll still be that way. Just the difference will be smaller.
---
now that is an awesome tip, thank you...
---
The information has been publicly released, you don't need to say it's a spoiler
---
Because he painted it, dropped it and didn’t read the notice?
---
Oh it would be amazing idk that amount of god rolls for other builds if had but just not what I’ve been looking for feel bad scripting them. Know a few people who would have liked them
---
Everything is at whitespring but violet, nuke the SBQ for that.
---
personally i hope they keep this model for the non-cosmetic items from the previous seasons. A. gives us a gold sink if we missed out on the previous seasons. and B. allows us to get more lunch boxes without having to worry so much about using them all.
---
The game lagged out as he was trying to drop something else!
---
Repetitive questions on this subreddit.
---
It would also be acceptable if 1* legendaries could drop 3* gear at the same rate that 3*'s drop 1*'s. Fair is fair.
---
Usually stuff like that, a lot of players have realized, so it's better to not bring it up...
---
well done and I do remember the lucky shades
---
You would have thought that after the exploit/bug/mistake last week on one of their titles, they would have rolled out mitigation or a fix to other titles. They shut down ESO for half a day to retrieve their unspent crowns &amp; presumably “fix” the issue. At some point it must become their negligence.
---
Dont be afraid of change, embrace it. Learn to love it, as it will make u a better player.
---
They are trying to make the game a tad be enjoyable/challenging. Instead of 1 shotting everything, now it takes like two or three shots. Not that big of a deal. And dont worry about ammo either, with the new ammo card, u will be swimming in ammo
---
Is this Destiny 2?
---
Shotgunner or Unarmed... I usually just tap one for the aggro and meet them at the speaker... I think I’ve done Lode Baring once or twice. I will be checking it out again soon, LOL. Thanks for the tip
---
It seems that, going forward, unique "Utility items" will be available for Gold Bullion after the season is over.
---
In this case, you'll be able to buy the Chicken Coop and Ammo Converter once the season is over.
---
The Bench Press that boosts Strength after use will likely also be available once Armor Ace finishes.
---
What does painting it have to do with it?
---
Such a simple yet elegant fix.  Nice suggestion
---
3\* random enemy - not nescessary
---
3\* boss - absolutly
---
Congrats mate.
---
i got mine today, lucky us :)
---
New to this reddit and the game. Only saying because I usually see lower levels asking good events to level. My intentions aren’t malicious just want everyone to meditate and relax 😃
---
Well I’m a bloodied build so raw meat works well for me, I usually eat spoiled meat since I have so much at any time.
---
A dropped item with an atom shop paint gets deleted!
---
Painting an item makes it so it will be destroyed when you try to drop it.
---
They will be.
---
For not getting something I paid for, yeah, okay bud.
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
It doesnt matter. It's a season pass. If you earned the XP to get to that reward but forget to claim it you should be able to claim it before the next season. You are just going against a QoL change that wouldn't affect you negatively in any way.
---
Are you using the cushioned leg mods? Just curious. A buddy of mine uses them and doesn’t seem to have a problem with it anymore.
---
Basically they changed the formula of how damage perks stack. Instead of being a multiplicative of each damage, it becomes additive of the base damage. Commando will still do more DPS, just not as much. Rifleman will still do big per shot damage, just not as much.
---
No, but Destiny 2 does have a season pass and being able to acquire earned rewards after the season ends is a good QoL implementation. Why Fallout 76 can't have this is beyond question. It wouldnt hurt in the slightest.
---
Hate it when i loss stable flux when I die after killing the queen.
---
Best tip do radiation rumble and line in the sand bring moltaive cocktails to get hits on several enemy's as plain grenades take to long to go off.
---
NOICE
---
I been playing mostly solo and wanted to play tank build. I see this game doesn't reward tanks and supports at all, since your armor getting destroyed and too many range enemies like scorchbeasts and during quests I have all these robots attached to the floor shooting at me. Also loot only drops for those who do damage so. Sry for the rant. Just no game out there able to have tank role properly, so annoying.
---
I meant the full Gear said including the helmet which is the coolest part
---
Np
---
There’s a nice bed to buy at whitesprings that’s the same one you have at the vault
---
Green Thumb perk + nuke zones.
---
Are you being sarcastic or something? Why would you even ask that? Of course you can’t.
---
still grinding for it.
---
now i just nuke to get technical data in the silo. have never not got one in the control room since i made a point of checking for it.
---
Just been trying to find a way to do this hence I found this post the camp Fire doesn't work
---
Who knows, people are guessing at the numbers involved, Bethesda are publishing them. A friend of ours was “gifted” 65,000 crowns, he said a friend of his got 200,000, we got none on either of our accounts. Nobody could work out why certain ESO players were chosen. 
---
Bethesda’s reaction may be different. But if players are banned from FO76 for it, I would be citing that Bethesda set a precedent just last week that it only warranted a “warning”. If they are citing a breach of T’s &amp; C’s as the reason then they (Bethesda) need to be consistent.
---
Yeah I’m just doing some wastelander quests then I’ll be going on some events
---
I’m sure it was not intended by the developers that people farm the event in this way.  So yeah, in a sense, it is an exploit.  But Bethesda could have disabled the event, so they must be cool with it.
---
Placing your FO1st tent a certain way causes the scorched to spawn that way. Exploit I guess.
---
Since they don't care at all when a player loose something, it would be fait for you to keep those atoms ;)
---
I was being serious. I didn’t know that if you download it, it changes as when I went to download it, it shows Fallout 76 but now that it’s downloading, it says B.E.T.A.
---
Sorry for not being as smart as you.
---
I have family share so that could be the issue, thanks
---
I don't have them, will add to my 'to try' list... thanks 👍
---
Lol I have sold my soul to Bethesda already
---
What platform I logged out last night after a crash and kept my lunch box effect
---
So how do u get the helmet out?
---
Are these lunchboxes you opened or that others opened?
---
What do you mean? You just downloaded the beta now? Also I wasn’t trying to insult you I was just genuinely confused.
---
All good I was just clarifying i wasnt misinformed
---
Zombies?
---
I'm being careful to land really slowly and do a little hover dance before touch down, only a few inches, still die. With marsupial and team perks I can jump way higher from the ground and never die like this.
---
It's not bugged, it's working as intended with their current system of more shots faster degradation. 
---
The same reason shotguns break faster as well.
---
I almost positive you can buy that helmet from one of the vendors in Whitesprings, the kid/toy store. Don’t remember his/her/it’s name. Be safe out there
---
There are plenty of things here to circlejerk about here. Score autocomplete being one of them
---
Yeah that's a good point, they can just disable it. Well I'm writing it here at least so lets see what they do.
---
This was someone else opened.
---
I think I am. When I went into my library, it showed the cover of Fallout 76 so I selected it to download. But now that it’s downloading, it’s showing the BETA artwork.
---
My apologies. It looked to me as though you were having a dig at me for asking a stupid question 😅
---
Idk I played dying light recently, scorcs? Idk word. U know what I mean :D
---
Ah that’s the normal fireman helmet, it goes with the fireman outfit from the Halloween event. This is the fire breather helmet.
---
it's not so much about hitting the jetpack gas as you are about to land. It's more of a case of the fall height speed. If you fall fast and even use all your AP to jepack before hitting ground you are going to take damage/die.
---
so tap tap when high
---
You can tank in this game, very well actually.  You’ll want power armor, defensive perks like dodgy, ricochet, born survivor, first aid, etc and a vampiric heavy gun or shotgun.
---
thanks!
---
No, I'm on Xbox. In happier news, I was blessed by RNGesus last night and finally got one.
---
I know of two bobble head hotspots(watoga transit hub and son of dane compound) but where are some of the other locations if anyone knows?
---
Yup...I never use this...what I have on me is for me!  You want something? Go check my vendors.
---
What is this using a grenade to get the outfit that you speak of? I'm guessing you use a grenade to make the outfit move to a space you can grab it? 
---
I didn't know there was a outfit on the second floor to be honest, now I'm going to have to log in soon and go look.

Link to images?
---
Exactly.
---
Yup she has some stuff in display cases on the second floor of her house, up the stairs and in the room to the left.
---
link added.
---
The ash piles from the tesla rifle are unique. They have blue sparks and shit in them, compared to the plain ash from the flamer and the red/green glowing ash from lasers and ultracite lasers.
---
LOL, I can never keep them straight. You’re absolutely correct, that the one I was thinking of.
---
They're removing the debuffs from not eating.
---
I’m reading about it now, pretty interesting
---
Nah,just a hobo matress on a fancy frame.that's crap for my camp style.  Could work well ina radier themed camp though.
---
Are you dumb? In the future, refrain from commenting  on things in which you know nothing of.
---
How did you even get the beta? I’m pretty sure you can only get if you pre ordered the game. I play on Xbox and I actually still have the beta downloaded it is a separate app and the file size is extremely small.
---
instead of just shutting up so more of could get lucky.
---
well done brown noser
---
No idea of that is intentional or not. The ones you open are definitely supposed to persist though.
---
Honestly...I looked At the rewards for season 2.  I really don’t see anything I’m super excited for.   So I prob will continue to play casually and I’ll progress how I progress.  I’m not gonna be as bothered by it as I was season 1.
---
That's the "Future-Tec World Bundle." It's under the Vaulting Tab.
---
Might be a good way to balance out the lower damage...they have no recoil and superior accuracy even at extreme range.
---
those are a part of the Future Tec Bundle. Pointy eared man is the original Pip boy, mascot on the pip boy on your arm
---
Scorched. They aren’t undead.
---
You can actually stand in a certain spot too, and it forced all the scorched into a single location every time, it's actually better than the tent but people don't know where to stand.
---
How did they fuck it up?
---
You'll want those perk packs for legendary perks.
---
I tried this last night. It is a game changer!
---
Ah it’s no worries, there’s at least three different variants of the outfits (Fireman, Firebreather, Responders) so it’s understandable to get em mixed up.
---
It’s really hit or miss &amp; it all depends on who else joins it with you
---
Ahh. If you own several items on the bundle,  does it show as owned in the shop?
---
Doesn't it already have it's own currency with "points"?
---
Another way of doing it however is to simply have the player move as much ammo as they want to sell - the system computes the total number of points it's worth and returns the couple of bullets that are extra. 
---
That's the most basic of computing coding taught to first year basic/fortran students...should look fine on a FO computer screen.
---
Nuke Fissure prime.  (there is a 'method' to get away with at least 8 -10 violet/crimson flux here, on a public server.
---
whitesping / harpers ferry/ morgantown if you on a private server, or server is empty, otherwise every post level 50 player is gonna be helping themselves to the free flux components lunch you provided, leaving you with scraps.
---
Trade them a "You have been insulted" or "You're the dumbass" note.
---
Did you... Read the description? Pretty much told exactly how to get it out, even added a picture to help too.
---
Look at the photos and it will show you how he did it. And it doesn't just fallout 4 you
---
It's not the point dude, It's not a roleplaying thread.
---
My phone won’t load the photos if it’s too much of a big deal to write 2 sentences don’t worry about it
---
You look behind the case... That’s it.
---
I tried to fast travel out of it yesterday to my camp and then, god knows why, I ended up appearing dead outside the mine with 200+ screws laying on the ground next to me. When I went back to my stuff someone was nice enough to leave me my wending o teeth but took the screws
---
Honestly...there’s no good farm for 45.  I mostly buy it from vendors.  But like above the only sure way is the ammo factory.  But in public servers you will prob get pvp there.  I’d say concentrate more on farming steel and lead to make yourself.  Make sure to equip max ammosmith and super duper when you make it for extra rounds crafted.   
---
The hanging cans traps I’ve found is the best way to farm lead and steel bc you can server hop to collect them.
---
No you can't. People killing bosses in 3 second, and scorchbeast queen are being killed before it drops, leaving you with no loot. The support perk cards doesnt give the support any credit for a kill, resulting you in giving support cards like the new legendary perk with increase damage when u getting hit, for no reason to yourself. The tank perk cards doesnt work. You cant just look at a card and think tank is viable without trying it. You never tried ricochet card if you are saying it work. Try it and see how little damage it deals back. Maybe it's a cool idea when you are level 5, but I'm talking end game here and they put tanking as part of the endgame with block and being hit passives, but in the current state of the game content, thats not viable.
---
What's your Gamertag I'm always down
---
Its a glitch you can force with the Fo1st tent.
---
Get a random explosive gun to tag the enemy's so you get all the xp and loot from the event.
---
You can easily level a few times and you get well over 1k steel from it.
---
I like doing the feed the people for the canned meat stew. Easy bonus xp from food that doesn't spoil. Even with the healing factor mutation you can still get 12% bonus on top of sleeping and stuff.
---
Unfortunately this isn't a problem with fall out 76 but is in fact a problem with the playstation messaging function. I only know this because my ax when we were still together racked up $300 worth of charges on my credit card while messaging her brother
---
I'm going against you
---
Same.  Also I'm not going to rush it either as I was pretty burnt out logging in daily.
---
Last night I spawned 50,000 feet in the air above foundation after fast traveling because some jackass glitched his tent into orbit. I did not die. I did not even take damage as far as I could tell. I have bird bones, but I was not wearing power armor.
---
I like to be a thief and lock pick people's containers. Collectrons, aluminum, etc.
---
Definitely not intended imo, at lunchtime I played a round of ACP with 100% bonus from everyone’s lunchboxes, finished, logged off, came back after work and still had the bonus active.
---
I’m just explaining they aren’t zombies... they also are not wearwolves, vampires or ewoks.
---
i thought about it, but the point of the build is maximum exp without sacrificing to much damage. 
---
I fully agree that is better for damage but max exp is the point.
---
Least with Earle ya get some from the spawn 🤣 I rock a Gatling gun so sometimes I'm leaving with more ammo than I had spent 🤣🤣
---
Do you know if fireproof has the same effect too?
---
Yeah me too.  This season doest really have much I want really to use.   So I’ll get what I get just playing like I want.
---
Not with that attitude they aren’t
---
AYEEEEE YAHHHHH
---
Damn I thought that cool looking on the left WAS a player icon... Now I’m kinda excited it’s an emote but rather disappointed it’s not a player icon now...
---
It's true. I play in a region with a ton of Chinese players. I've even visited CAMPs with CCP propaganda written on the walls in neon letters XD
---
The majority of them use the communist items like the PA and handmade skins.
---
Chinese players are often drawn to FPSs and games that have a lot of exploits to take advantage of. I wouldn't be surprised if they make up a good part of FO76's player base.
---
I don’t use heavy weapons but I keep a flamer in my camp waiting for when people do this exploit. Only does like 20 damage to each enemy so I’m not stealing kills, but ensures I level up multiple times. I don’t actively cause the exploit but might as well take advantage of it.
---
Raiders salt
---
They need to drop the treasure notes down to 4 and add repair kits. 
---
I’ll be doing ACP till I get all my toons the plans then that might be it.   If it gave repair kits I wouldn’t mind doing the event more.
---
Fireproof has a similar effect but far less effective.
---
Sry for the question but what does FOMO mean? 😅
---
Fomo cradling: I may be on the other side of this. While I’m not terribly offended by the fact that they removed the legendary effect that the Free Radicals mask had, the reason they provided for removing it was bupkis, saying that it gave other players an unfair advantage because they chose a certain path that some didn’t (#weallknowtherealrea$on). But it served as a reward for players who played the game a certain way.
---
(Lunchboxes aside as I was hoping there would be a way to obtain these in the future even it was atoms) Moving on the season rewards, I feel like if you missed out on rewards, you missed out, sorry. Maybe you’ll get lucky and they add it to the atom shop. The ammo converter is the exception in this as all player should get to experience the travesty that it is and in spite of that has proven to be a good (albeit shitty) tool for acquiring ammo. Like a neighbor who’s really really annoying but he mows your yard for you for free. The chicken coop is a fancy cosmetic for the Brahmin. I don’t know of anyone who’s goin “damn I need more fertilizer faster and I wish there was a faster way”. Personally I think it’s a bit of an insult to the people who worked their way up the game board to earn the chicken coop, or even the people who spent atoms to obtain that rank on the game board. Maybe I’m one of the people who enjoys getting a random message from a player asking where I got a certain item from because I’ve been playing since beta. Like the atom shop ceiling fan or fish lamp. I know they’re cycling through old atom shop stuff and I can’t remember if they’ve cycled either of those again or not. So when I get a message from another player about them I can say “yeah it was a shop item from the before times.” A little bit of bragging rights.
---
I’m not trying to stir the pot or spread negativity, but it does bother me, and some of my friends, because we worked for these rewards and did the challenges and waded through the monotony, and only to be told that some of the items we worked for will be available for purchase with another in game currency. My friend really wanted the chicken coop (don’t know why at all/I didn’t really care about it). But when he found out that it could be bought with bullion after the end of the season he cried “bullshit-I worked for that” and I agreed. For us it’d be like being able to buy the Nuclear Winter trophies with atoms.
---
Sorry for this being a long-ish rant. My friends and I have talked about this and I wanted to include some of the arguments or analogies they presented in our discussion. 
---
TLDR: FOMO cradling.
---
I know all the lore related to paw patrol. my 4 year old daughter loves it. everest is her favourite. I like rubble.
---
Instead it was absolutely imperative that they nerf the damage of all weapons. While not reducing the damage of enemies and making them bullet sponges.
---
An exploit is a game bug that can reproduced in favor of the player.
---
In this case it's the survival tent placed on a spawn point.
---
You don't need to server hop, just get a shotgun and tag all the mobs. It's an XP fest for all.
---
Loved the exact same Blood Eagle skin for the handmade (lvl79), but it's called Red Viper. Well done!
---
Left one with red cross under it IS a player icon. Right one with green check mark under it isn't used in the season at all. The "Watching you" emote looks like this on the PTS:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/MBcW2JK.png](https://i.imgur.com/MBcW2JK.png)
---
But are they US?
---
Just so you know, you can lock certain “resource” items by going to the Edit mode (where you move stuff around), and you’ll see “lock” as an option on the screen. ps this is the same menu where you can add wallpapers to walls (I didn’t know that for a long time).
---
Isnt this like one if the rarest outfit sets?
---
Btw, is there a legit reason why energy weapons don't have suppressors?
---
**Liberty Prime hated that.**
---
But according to normal social behavior, I made a thread about exploiting. You can't just randomly walk up to someone and start talking about whatever you want. People will look weird at you. It's how our society works. And since I made a post about exploiting, I clearly had no intention of talking about ingame npc's history.
---
I've seen others post similar stories here but I thought with this bug/glitch the items were sold at the game value, so for fusion cores they'd be priced at the default of 162 caps? How would it assign a value of 1 cap to something you didn't put in your vendor?
---
You did an awesome research work, i love it :)
---
Every currency in FO76 has a daily limit and 20-odd hour cooldown. Sort of surprised you hadn't noticed.
---
It’s been harder for me to get a match this week too. I guess cause lots of people have finished legendary run so don’t need to run it for score anymore...? (The reason I’m doing it anyway lol)
---
Tastes great...less filling!
---
The Burrows, The burning mine, that galleria place in the mire, and vault 94.
---
\*Fear Of Missing Out\*,   
---
When there's something that everyone else is doing, and they seem to do it really easily and you seem to be struggling to get it done, you start stressing about it FOMO then starts setting in, and you put more time into it, stop enjoying what your doing and then things turn into grind, but you can't stop because you don't want to miss out on the experience that everyone else seems to be having.
---
They most likely wont do anything because those tents are independent of the camp-building and no-building-zones.
---
There are imho 2 solutions to this. Either move the spawns to somewhere where a tent can not be placed (hard to find around there), or sort the tent into the camp category so it is subject to the no-build-zones (Which will defeat the one thing F1st is good for) and lose loads of subscribers as this would be map-wide.
---
Thank you :)
---
Thanks!!
---
Not us! Not us!
---
I like that idea
---
For suggesting a QoL change. Lmao
---
Hard to hit the mobs from all the way back there .)
---
My favorite is when Rocksy's target is a 3 star legendary
---
You also made a post about zombies... who don’t exist in this game. You brought zombies up, not me.
---
I found food spoiling and buffs disappearing when logging off, I have started leaving any team I am joining then leaving world via options menu
---
We nuked a guy that did this, he was AFK so his base was destroyed. We walked through the walls and looted all the ammo machines. Got quite a lot of 5mm and 5.56 ammo.
---
Know your role, I take out the wendigo hordes so the heavies can do what they do best. 
---
I play bloodied VATS crit sniper and spend a fair bit of the mission sitting in an excavator bucket one shotting wendigos until they are gone then concentrate on Earle while my adrenalin is high. The players in power armour using a gatling laser standing in front of Earle get a fair bit of my attention as I kill everything near them.
---
3 star rad cicken.....I like it
---
No, the Responders Fireman outfit and helmet are rare but the Firebreathers outfit and helmet are given during the Responders quest line. Different skins on them.
---
That would be great if it had a line like "I found plans for an extremely powerful weapon. I shredded it for humanity's protection."
---
Buy one from a player vending machine. If you just want a legendary version ive seen plenty recently.
---
If you have fallout 1srt, drop a nuke on whitespring in your server, run through the area and kill any Ghoul that isn't dead from the nuke, log out and back in, and repeat.
---
Everytime you clear the area and log out and back in, it will spawn a fresh bundle of ghouls. You'll get tons of GM, HM, and HRF
---
You can usually do this for about 2 hours before the radiation from the nuke dissapears.
---
Plus it's one hell of a good way to farm steel and ammo I pull around 3000 grand or more in steel alone
---
RAGE GRINDERS UNITE!
---
HATE TO PLAY.
---
PLAY TO HATE.
---
(repeat x5)
---
If only. I lost count of how many are bugged that i know i have completed. Can't ticket because how the hell am i supposed to prove a lot of it!? I am so defeated by going for any of those now to complete, reward or not. I know it's kinda silly but i feels like  Either way we loose.
---
Ah, then get rid of the U and I'm good
---
For some reason the flux I get from the queen just goes straight to my stash.
---
At first I thought I just wasn't getting any of flux, but I wrote down how flux I had in my stash, launched a nuke killed the queen and when I got the reward I looked in my pip-boy and no flux. I then checked my stash and I had +1-2 of each except crimson for what ever reason.
---
I don't know what I did for this to happen every time at the queen but I'm not complaining.
---
Just claim the rewards. Seriously, there's a week between seasons. You don't need an extra week.
---
On xbox the beta is still avalible to download if you had the beta during the actual beta date.
---
And to answer their question. No they can't play the beta as it ended before the launch of the game. They will have to buy the game again. But if they own gamepass they can play fo76 for free.
---
As others have already said - it'll be part of an atom shop bundle. There's no way they would pass up a chance to sell that outfit.
---
Correction. 
---
Players cared bgs doesnt.
---
Toxic Valley is my favourite for violet, if you hit wavy Willard’s in the top of the radius. Can easily get a couple hundred raw violet with Green Thumb
---
I play EU PC and I see hacked weapons at least once a week, sometimes multiple players per session. Usually it's an explosive 50 cal or handmade with a shotgun laser barrel. Pretty obvious. 
---
The other day we saw the old fat man minigun.
---
My point still stands. I'll be claiming the rewards no problem, but others might miss out or forget.
---
Your going to use an exploit to punish for using an exploit.
---
I get the feeling you are making an important point - but I can't understand what you're saying... Keep up with the punctuation: Not all of us are in your head
---
that would make sense, honestly. Like I said in the post, if my post helps at least 1 person out, it’ll be worth it.
---
Do the peopaganda fliers do anything?
---
Please tell me this is a joke, they are lasers, aka light you can't silence that witch doesn't have sound. I do know that the lazers in fallout 76 make sound but that's just fallout for you.
---
Fyi Not a hate comment just honestly hope your just joking.
---
Scorched have .45 pretty often.  Aside from that its best to use acid, cloth, lead and steel ore and make youre own, for sure.
---
This is painfully accurate.
---
Sorry I meant right, edited my comment.
---
My raider bot isn’t going anywhere she’s the best all those chems and alcohol yuuuum
---
76 is at its core an MMO. They are designed to be time sinks and tease you with the VERY small chance at a reward vs a lot of time.    
---
You give up time for the script in small amounts only to get crap 99.99% of the time. Most people are looking for certain effects so most of what  you get is scripted back or sits in your shop while many try to become Fallout billionaires.    
---
Your best bet is to learn patience, ask players for what you want, and hop around to player CAMPS. The fact that all legendary gear is random like that is intentional.
---
Lol gud/good
---
Tattered rags, ushanka hat, bottlecap glasses, surgical mask, and Chally backpack. Going for the "just rolled out of a dumpster" dirt-grubbing scavver look. Hunting for a tattered field jacket atm to upgrade a bit.
---
Yeah I know all of that I was just wondering why they owned the beta but not the actual game. Also not sure why I was downvoted. I was only trying to help.
---
Oh man....the ignorance of this comment is just hilarious.
---
No. I go to play it on xboxone and I have over 2 million atoms, but I still get the disconnected notice. BUT when I go onto the PC through gamepass I can get in game like normal.
---
waiting for "Bethesda Replied x1"
---
I suspect most FO76 players are RPG players not really shooting game fans. At least that’s how the atom store owner sees it. There’s way more camp and costumes items than weapon skins and the trend is only getting worse. Out of the few weapon skins some are so poorly made and they have no intention to fix them although it can be done in five minutes. I sit on thousands of atoms and don’t know what to spend them on, 1st isn’t attractive to me because there’s no weapon skins to buy with all those free atoms.
---
It does but its got a cap. I you have 10 agility it will raise it to 15 agility.
---
Its for players who dont need to go over 15 perk points but need a few more points to finish their build.
---
Then I could kill it for a Legendary item and not have it run off attacking things I don't want.
---
 Check out “Lost Home” in the cranberry bog.    Two bobble heads can spawn here along with two potential magazines.  There is also some power armor.
---
Same here with only coming to reddit after my carector was way over 100. Honestly I only came to reddit becouase of Emkay. But when I heard of this subreddit I knew I had to check it out, not regretting it at all. This is my fravrite social media.
---
Perfect.
---
I was drunk one night and bought a second plan because I already had it in my inventory but not read from a few days earlier.
---
Ended up selling it for 13k caps.
---
And the fact that if someone is requesting my item, my only options are to give it a price (with a risk that someone will buy it for that 30k) or close the trade menu, is frustrating. 
---
I'd like a "not for sale" option.
---
Where do you get the "you're the dumbass" note?!
---
I stay stocked up on the insult bot notes, in case I come across someone being a tool or someone who charges exorbitant amounts of caps for crap in their vendors.
---
I would very much like to stock up on the dumbass note haha
---
*cough fireworks
---
Haha same
---
How about they just remove useless legendary effects like nocturnal, mutant slayer, ghoul slayer, zealot?
---
Fort defiance. There are like 100 aluminum trays there. Maybe not that many but you get the idea. The hospital in Charlston. Tin cans 2nd floor of the house on the corner of Helvitia, ella ames bunker (hell any bunker). Tim can chimes sunny top ski lanes, camden park and white springs golf club. That is what i can think of off the top of my head. Screws and springs go to sugar grove and the place to the south and the other listening station to the south west. Lots of fans and typewriters.  I have played this game way to much 😆
---
&gt; I play EU PC
---
From Australia?
---
All gear is leveled anyway, new players.    
---
Like it or not, you're going to get stuck with lower level crappy items that don't have the effects you want. A regular weapon vs a Legendary that does the same damage with the same mods but has an effect is better than the regular one.    
---
My main has a lot of good gear and lots of time/hours to show for it. If you're expecting us to give you a handout b/c you're 'new' don't expect level 50 gear or end-game items.
---
If they added A slider they would see what they did with wastelanders in the first weeks, a happy player baae.
---
Oof
---
This.  Your enemies are just big boxes of Cracker Jacks.
---
Im Australian and live in the UK. I haven't changed my bio.
---
Actually, your point that other games do it, isn't a good point. 
---
Games shouldn't all work the same. What's the point? Then every game is basically the same. Which still happens a lot.
---
For screws just scrap every typewriter, toy car and truck, desk fan, etc you see. Eventually you accumulate so many of them. I also join Scorched Earth whenever possible for the improved repair kits it awards for completing it. Using those for weapons and armor that are more resource intensive to fix will allow you to save more of your junk for crafting the legendary armor and weapons.
---
Who down voted this?
---
# get rid of the health kits
---
Coolant caps from all of the outside ac units at the harpers ferry armory are also aluminum.
---
You’re fun.
---
I bet people like you.
---
/s.
---
I still accept to piss them off. Open trade, they request my best gear, and then I just walk away.
---
I second this
---
They are meant to
---
Kill legendary enemies
---
Probably player vendor would be your best bet, if there are sellers like myself some sell excess legendaries for super cheap
---
Im not hating on it as its got a few items i would like and by the looks of it it will be easier for me (always away from home due to work) to get to max rank. I disliked this current season as it almost felt like a job because I had to focus mostly on the repeatable weekly to get most of my score.
---
Im yet to see all the rewards but I dont see many players wanting radaway and stims or nukashine as rewards because they are easy enough to come by anyway. An example would be me and my build. It dosent need radsway or stimpacks 90% of the time as im almost a tank that heals rads and health without doing anything (Perks and mutations) so I tend to either drop or sell hundreds of rhem a day to vendors as i can sell them quicker and for the same price as my player vendor can.
---
What do you mean?
---
and then the next one, we get another meat week!
---
They went to the character you collected them on.
---
Or atleast they should have.
---
Me to, i'd log in daily, rush the challenges and then log out = gameplay ruined.  
---
Though they are now going to do bonus weekly challenges for people who can't play daily which will hopefully get rid of the daily grind feeling.
---
Completely agree. I love the amount of personalisation we can have and that I can spend a lot of time on my camp just to make it aesthetically pleasing. I like to have atoms there just in case but I don't buy them, mainly because I only find something to spend them on after I've accumulated a lot anyways.
---
I WANT THAT LITTLE VAULT TEC VAN!!!
---
It's one QoL change that could be put into the game. Does that make it the same as other games? Maybe, but I'm not gonna get p*ssed off if they do it because it it has similarity with another game. It's not like it's going to change the game forever, it's just one small thing to improve it.
---
I don't see a reason as to why someone would be against something that could benefit a portion of the playerbase.
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper.    
---
So after this 'patch' I'm going to be forced into a Commando Build?
---
I miss Survival even though I hated the way it was implemented.  Too many people thought PvP was the only point. 
---
I really want a Survival mode that is Survival characters only, limited fast travel, diseases and crippled limbs last until actually dealt with, no quality of life perks like Ammosmith or Super Duper, limited or no legendaries, and far less bullet spongeiness for both enemies and players. 
---
You could probably keep the pvp rules in place from original Survival in this scenario.  I got real tired of people camping at the Whitesprings train station to poprock anyone trying to travel there.
---
I had someone open four at an event last week. When I logged off and back on they were still active.
---
The health kits are really annoying for me. 
---
Stimpaks in disguise absolutely should not be in the seasons pass imho
---
Well you can’t kill your own pet. But it sure would be powerful as a 3 star
---
Good luck trying to get power leveled.    
---
As a new player you need to put in the time. Builds don't play the same and following someone around to get to 50 isn't going to get your the experience or gear.
---
Yeah I had been given neither that first like part to the run I had done on my first character so I knew it’d go to one account but it’s on neither, guess I’ll get a support ticket or whatever
---
When did they say they want it to be like ESO?  ESO has set classes and yet you are able to switch between DPS, Tank and healer very easily.  This system is the opposite of that as it would have tanks eliminating the possibility of ever healing.
---
Have you ever played ESO?
---
The health kits (stimpaks in disguise annoy me)
---
stealth may not work but ill still shred them while crouching
---
Yeah this is a block. Have a nice day.
---
Probably not (i do hope we get a level cap increase) as it would require a rework of a few things.
---
But with the legendsry perks coming you can get close if you have enough perk csrds to scrap.
---
Even though my friend was on my first private server? When I joined the new private server
---
The rewards are largely the same. A new skin for armors and weapons we already have. Pretty sure every enemy we encounter doesn't care how 'fly' or not we look. I don't care how others look. Cosmetics add no benefit.    
---
I'm most certainly not going to pay real money for Atoms to get an item I'll never own.
---
You can't.
---
It's not though. A week isn't that much between seasons. More so since you get the rewards as you go along, that means if you are sitting on say, all the Atom rewards, you've already had months and weeks to decide which character you want them to have. 
---
Camp items and skins are account wide. Resources are character specific. So it's not like you are having tough choices to make. 
---
Also, I suspect that once the season ends on the 8th, they will be taking it down from the menu, in prep for the next season.
---
So no, not really a QoL to give people an extra week to finally decide something they have had weeks, maybe even months, to decide. 
---
It's people saying it's QoL to try and make it seem like they are being abused and mistreated by Bethesda. 
---
You know what a QoL change looks like? Removing the sliders for amounts, and putting something like number selection so people with arthritis have it easier. Having options to change colors for colorblind or dyslexic. 
---
Bitching about wanting more time to put off making a choice isn't QoL.
---
If you want to get technical, without this display case/grenade thing, you would normally only have the one chance to receive the Firebreather outfit (even if it is guaranteed). 
---
The Responders may be super duper ungodly rare to get one but you could theoretically get dozens of them if you REALLY tried
---
Been happening since you were in diapers.
---
Shotgun doesn’t seem to far fetched. I just assumed by uny b2525 he meant commando. Granted i’m only running bobbles and ballistic bock but i’m getting no where near those numbers with a b2525 fixer
---
No, but you can sell them for 1 cap each at an NPC vendor.
---
You got downvotes because this is reddit and people seem to downvote whatever they want because they can (dont know why they did)
---
But the beta was easy to get into. You could get it a few ways on xbox. Preorder the game, buy a key for $1 on eBay, wait till the public beta which lasted a few days.
---
Yes, there is a cure. However you need to finish the first quest with the overseer. 
---
Rose is...messing with you a bit now and then.
---
its just bethesda redistributing the wealth of all the S.C.O.R.E. levels i bought. :)
---
It's an MMO at its core. Do you remember who made this game? Glitchthesda has made 76 into a huge time sink.    
---
Killing an enemy with a weapon only for it to not have that weapon but another weapon and ammo it doesn't use.
---
You get the cure when you inoculate yourself at AVR Medical center, it's when you collect the blood and fuse from Gregs mining supply. You're looking for mechanical parts at the moment for a system to detect the spread of the scorched plague. Which part did you get stuck on? If it was the wendigo cave there is a solution if you don't want to wait for one wasteland.
---
Happy cake day! Yes, that could make sense.
---
The game is too easy as it is
---
I can if your on xbox  with the exception of 1 even after 2 years searching I am missing Gun's and Bullets #4 can't find it anywhere.. I've run around the map at every spawn location known, i've found magazines at every location, even left magazines sitting their and server hopped to see if the mag has changed and in some cases it did, but never G&amp;B 4.
---
Sell franchise to CDPR.
---
Again, it’s 3 points over a 15% dmg boost.  I get the XP thing but 3 points isnt gonna break it.  15% more damage = faster killing = quicker XP gains.   Just sayin.
---
"They have things like an ATOM bug"
---
"I think I'll just say ugh!"
---
"Bethesda nation, I'll stay right here!"
---
Ah I actually didn’t know there was a public beta. Thanks for the information.
---
Killing a 3 Star and getting a 1 star feels a lot like in Destiny 1 Year 1 where you'd get a legendary engram only to have it decrypt to an uncommon.
---
I believe video games should be built upon feel good moments, and these multiple layers of RNG simply don't feel good. RNG stands for Really Not Good in my book.
---
I bought a year cuz buying each month individually costs more....but the game is acting like i never bought it and it's not showing up in my subscription list
---
The enemies should have a lower chance of detecting that you're attacking them if you have a fast weapon with a 40% melee speed perk.
---
Solar adds 4 hp per second, what rads + ghoulish can heal 9 per second. 13 is better than 4.
---
Because they want you to BUY, BUY, BUY
---
Even though nuclear winter already gives you some cool mk1/2/3 paints why pay for new ones
---
they already know most players own the rights to legendary weapons 🤣 so they can't sell those to ya
---
That white fire helmet is one of the rarest items in the game 
---
Hope you didn't drop it
---
Always finish the fight before you try to heal!
---
Yeah but this is in the style of a pre-war comic/cartoon though - so it seems to be valid and match the theme of the event
---
Thanks, and that's mostly because I hadn't looked properly until the last couple of hours.
---
Yeah it is. Nevermind that you take rads quicker than you regenerate them though. So at some point you would HAVE to wait.
---
I...I just feel like I should read this in some sort of stuttering pattern with rap music playing in the background...
---
The F76 rap. Of course it would need a lot of that record scratching to match the rubber banding effects.
---
The Tayler County Workshop would be an awesome place to make creatures run and bet stuff on them! It reminds me of that Raider outpost near the Airport in Fallout 4, where robots run.
---
I want my Paw patrol doggo hut
---
Thank you. This is my first real delve into legendaries in this game so the frustration was real haha.
---
that's a good spot, I forget about it sometimes
---
Little bit of both
---
I’m not, but the 50 rads per shot is too many you irradiate yourself before you healed yourself.
---
Lol. Ok
---
Yeah I'm thinking that's what I'll do with mine. Maybe somebody can find a use for a junkie fat man!
---
I like it! I was all excited and showed my wife (not a player but enjoys the cosmetics) and she was all "ugh that is so ugly!" so I guess I am in the minority, but still!
---
I like it
---
I don’t know but it’s not fair he’s only stating a valid point
---
^^
---
 [https://www.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia](https://www.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia) this is a really useful map for finding bobbleheads
---
It could be all 3 and I wouldnt care. Only interested in camp stuff / atoms anymore
---
Well the latter does lead into the former as one doesn't exist without the other.
---
Bethesda considers exploits that don't directly affect their finances or the operation of their servers as a low priority.
---
The 300 rad resistance of what rads should help mitigate that.
---
I can set you up with something nice what kind of build are you and what level?
---
“Should” is the key word here.
---
Not a million miles away - its Talky Toaster from Red Dwarf which I feel might be what its referencing, maybe?
---
Ah ok so in the 80's then
---
Nukashine is one of the strongest Melee Attack buffers. Some people buy thousands of Nuka Quantum to stock up on shine
---
Thirding this
---
The stash box stays but you can only withdraw from it
---
Man, that would be so awesome! 
---
I can't wait to play their Fallout 5!  In, ironically, 2076.
---
You cannot add to the scrapbox but you can still use what is in there
---
I could really use this since I missed a few weeks of season 1 and have the entire last 3rd of the board left
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Thankyou for the fast reply!
---
I think there's some kind of exploit going on at the moment involving atoms so it's possible they've disabled new subscribers for a while
---
while taking your money
---
Maybe he should have been more patient?
---
They should make it so a skin works on more than one weapon. The same skin should apply to handmade, fixer and radium rifle.
---
Yeah like I’m not understanding why they’re posting and not spending...
---
At the end when rewards pop up.
---
The more bullets you have the more you play. Plus it destroys the ammo currency market that Bethesda doesn't like.
---
ALL HAIL TODD THE GODD HOWARD FOR THIS BOUNTIFUL BLESSING
---
The only odd part is that you will never know which rewards are which until it's too late so I will need to complete every season where it is even slightly reasonable to do so. The ammo converter felt like a weird thing to lock behind a random limited time season, so I always assumed that would come back. Weight bench has utility so locking that away would be weird too. The low rank rewards could never be considered trophies anyway since they were so easy to get. 
---
The only thing that shouldn't have been converted into gold purchases were the vault 94 stuff since there was actually difficulty to earn those originally. Those armor and steel should have been integrated into other endgame grinds such as SBQ, Collosal Problem or Daily Ops.
---
Now will the green house building set be locked down or sell that for gold after? Not a risk worth taking so I'll put in the work for now.
---
There is not all that much else to do, depending on level ofc. But I dont know if I want to do all of it again.
---
Thanks 👍
---
Exactly!  You want a few bobby pins,  or some aid items?  Maybe a few frag grenades?  Sure, no charge.  My favorite rifle?  No.  Just no.
---
It was a valid question. There’s no need to get upset.
---
visual glitch. nuclear winter related.
---
Same too
---
I don't understand... how
---
To be fair it probably will look better in game than in this little image.  But in the rewards image it just looks like plain circles.
---
Lag Spikes occur out of nowhere since patch 21!
---
So thats how they do it. Never figured that out!
---
Visual only. But I do wiah we could get big nukes.
---
I like olives.
---
Yeah at the end. I got it on my 4th try. I love the thing. After I made a post about finally getting it ppl started offering me 5k caps or whatever. I love the look and has a awesome light so I ain’t trading that bad boy. The chest at the end don’t give nothing but caps and junk. It’s pointless to get
---
Great, nice to know I had been not only banking on those atoms to finish my pass but also using the scrapbox, still nice to know that after spending £200 at launch and defending the game for the two years I get a punch to the chin whikst they stick their hands down my pockets once more. Thanks anywho.
---
What the fuck I've never bothered to check. Will do from now on. I'd love to see a beam splittered gatling fat man though. The only viable Fatman ever.
---
It wouldn't change anything, just make the C.A.M.P. box be folded up instead of having the whole drill and stuff
---
You should have already figured that out if you are already doing quests for rose... as well as the overseer. Did you do the ounce of prevention quest?
---
Queens runs random drop or player vendors
---
I mean what is Bethesda going to do?  I took over some guys workshop at Poseidon energy that had like 50 of them,  didn’t cause the exploit or even take any ammo but someone could have stopped back by the workshop and seen all of it.  It’s not like I took the time to destroy all of it or left the world..  They’ll fix it eventually.  Let the noobs duplicate their precious 556 lmao.
---
most vendors for like 25 caps or something. 
---
xbox?
---
I’m starting to realize how hard fallout76 fell into the mmo formula
---
What platform are you on? Someone might have a plan for you. Its a sbq drop, btw.
---
If you play over steam or game pass, you have 2 ingame wallets. 
---
One with steam or microsoft, and with Beth. While MS refunds usually w/o a problem, steam not so much. In both cases their CS point the finger at each other and you are left in the middle, usually with the only recourse of having to charge back.
---
If you don't buy atoms or F1st, that's no problem.
---
Additionally steam and game pass install to different directories and use different filenames, so installing mods or even the game onto a drive different than C: will raise issues.
---
Chest at the end? Guess I missed something every time I played on live servers.
---
Honestly I just really wana see a shit ton more skins for most weapons, and why do some weapons just not have any mods for them?
---
You could try raising a ticket. you still have 4 days or whatever to get them.
---
Yup I can’t agree more
---
Fair enough, I was about to ask how you manage that with EU and AUS being in completely different timezones :)
---
Yesterday they went down to zero, but after hard resetting my system and getting back into game the 2 million were back!
---
I will never, ever give up my forest camo jumpsuit :)
---
Ill give that a try, thanks for the help!
---
good call, still wish it could be 50/50 with one of the commie outfits being armor ace one
---
Did you log out of the game and log back in?  I know you have to do that on Xbox sometimes.
---
This has been happening since Fallout 1st was introduced, just not as well known as it has been for the last few months. They are not going to do anything about it. You can nuke the tree in Tanagra town and farm it non stop unlike this one that has a timer and the tree has been around since day one.
---
A blessing and a curse, lol
---
good point, but instead of 2 commie outfits, could we do 50/50? haha
---
I used to work nights so it worked for us lol. Otherwise it's tough, total opposite schedules.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, man. I'm just saying that if the server is lagging hard, maybe don't button mash if you have things you'd rather not lose?
---
Player vendors, don't pay more than 50-100 caps though.
---
I used to be able to make it off the lighthouse with careful jetpacking.
---
Typically, the goal is to not gain the 'terminal velocity'
---
Be a shame if it had changed. :-(
---
think the next fo5 will be in placed in China? haha jk
---
It became a good feeling. The bugstalgia.
---
This happens occasionally annoyingly.  It happens somewhat frequently as I thought logging out did reset your buffs for a while.  Then I remember one specific morning logging on after sleeping for 8 hours and I still had a lunchbox and well rested active.
---
I do not like olives
---
haha true, i guess beggars can't be choosers...i take whatever i can get...lol
---
lol no.
---
Yeah the quest ounce of prevention,  a pretty early quest, won't finish and allow you to continue.
---
There are 2 problems.
---
One is an atoms bug at this very moment, and one is buying it over steam.
---
Buying over steam is afaik not instantaneously, and you should raise your problem with steam because they serve as the processor.
---
yeah that's true, i enjoy the camp items a lot. but since i rarely use PA, i wanted at least an armor ace outfit to wear for the season
---
very common visual glitch
---
uffff so true
---
For what then?
---
And Sticks .. oh my
---
3 star rad chicken for wasteland governor
---
I'm just happy that the Theremin came back around...
---
I want a rad chicken helmet
---
That seems to only happen when solo and if you stay at the bridge location (in my experience).  If you jump onto the potted plant, and stay in sneak, you'll get ghouls to spawn at the bridge, and only there.
---
On the other hand, if  you skip the bridge and move to the speaker by the parking lot, you'll get a TONS of ghouls, but as soon as all but one speaker you are by is broken, the guru will stop talking, but the mission/ghouls will keep going/spawning.
---
Have never failed it, usual kill time around 5-8 mins with my group. We're coordinated and well geared. One Tank, one - on add control and the rest on DPS for Earl, its an easy event.
---
Must’ve gotten mine. They haven’t posted yet, but I am on PC.
---
I was dropping my junk at acp. It was only once tho. I would think it was a bug. But ya 2000 screws so far.
---
There are loose fire breather helmets in the world as well
---
well said and i agree, just wish we could get one armor ace outfit for free
---
Shhhhh,  just no one show up with a Tesla and crash the server next time :p
---
"I hadn't looked properly"
---
Literally the reason for 99% of the complaints on this subreddit.
---
true that
---
Same. Dropped 4k wood and plastic, though, plus as much as I could for Alpha. Still feel I earned the rewards.
---
i haven't even used mine yet...anything exciting happen?
---
your baseless accusations
---
It was a camo.. I think they changed it wtf it’s so similar to the current one we have
---
Yes!
---
uffff stimpacks...rad-aways...lolllllll
---
and nukashine? seriously...
---
Seems resolved.  I was looking under all however game bugged out and required a hard reset.
---
Thanks for answering though.
---
yeah it's unfortunate
---
Goat legs rank 2 in Agility. Reduces all fall damage by 90%.
---
yeah someone said that after seasons, the communist stuff will be the theme with the most items...crazy
---
Poop
---
Oh my god
---
Yeah it's hilarious combined with the melee speed perk for max ora ora.
---
I'm renaming mine as *"oraoraora"* now.
---
  LMG and 50 cals are hungry beasts if you use either one regularly.
---
So ya run lucky hole mine...and need lots of acid to smelt the 600 lead ore you pick up there...
---
It sells well in my vendor, too :)
---
Sounds a lot like the war on drugs,  I bet your crusade will be just as successful.
---
It's an observation. With the implementation of FO 1st, it became apparent that there had been some shifting around behind the scenes, and likely some people from the ESO team were brought in to drive profits up. This isn't going to stop us from switching roles. It will allow us to highly specialize in a role, and we could still swap around perks and equipment to fulfill another role. Same as ESO. 
---
I play it regularly, yes.
---
Hell yes. Lets get a rad chicken costume like the Chally one we got at this last meat week. Or gives us a bunch for all the non-hostile creatures like the possum, squirrel, beaver, radstag(?). Call it "Friends of the Wasteland" bundle.
---
100% if they think it would be "too much" just let them be rarer but when you see a 3\* you should get a 3\*
---
As I said, the lag spikes come out of nowhere, it wasn't lagging when he went in to press it,only as the deed was done.
---
How is this against the general spirit of Fallout? You were always pushed towards a certain build, especially in the first 2 games.
---
Not saying people aren't having an issue with that,, but I do wonder of some just don't know how timezones work. Someone posted about it the other day and their comment was just a minute after 11am (CST) when they actually reset. I can see someone not realizing it's still right before 11am on their end, especially on a Tuesday, and seeing their daily and weekly challenges done.
---
Equipping them without throwing them gives you almost instant reloads.
---
Ah I found it,  when i went to modify it was there I must of got it from the Queen without realising, sorry guys lol.
---
I have modded the ultracite to be a dark matter cosmic suit with the cosmic jetpack.... looks amazing
---
Congrats...its been a long mission. Now I can park my tent somewhere else!
---
Just make sure when you work on Wastelanders main story, you do all the quests for both factions before siding with one or the other. The game will tell you where advancing will lock you in with that faction.
---
this did not work. Xbox would not screenshot the image. It would screenshot in-game images, but not images from my gallery.
---
i said this once and got downvoted to hell with people saying thats too much to ask for and to stop being greedy
---
There are workarounds for it, I got passed it ok a few weeks ago.. I know 3 fixes that are reported to work so have a search
---
Because it's just lazy.
---
It's the illusion of having "new content".
---
But we're just doing the exact same thing as before. And being rewarded for chewing gums.
---
As someone who has the entire collection of faster fire rate and explosive lasers, of course I am going to agree. With that said, something needs to be done.
---
My explosive lasers are really, good in almost every instance, while my faster fire rate lasers are nothing more than dust collectors at the moment.
---
As much as it pains me to admit, some type of middle ground has to be found between the two. Even if that means that both weapon classes are merged into one that put the lasers on par with everything else out there.
---
Hey, question. Why dont you guys use luck of the draw if your guns break too much. The only gun i have problems with isnt a gun, my super sledge
---
There have been several workarounds posted on this sub, not sure how successful they are though. The only one that I can personally vouch for is hopping on a private server to complete the bugged mission (ounce of prevention) as I did that with a new character and it worked just fine. So if you have access to that or can find someone on your platform to host you real quick, you'll be fine.
---
DIablo 3 (now, not the garbage state it launched in) actually has a pretty good model for improving loot and getting decent drops.  Sure, perfect rolls are rare and there's not much you can do to specifically find them, but the ability to farm drops MUCH faster as you gear up, to reroll items, and to modify items allows you to gradually improve your gear fairly reliably.  In addition, while farming loot you're increasing your paragon level, which is a nice, steady reward.
---
We tried to transcribe the treasure hunter Morse code, but it was jibberish or an incomplete fragment
---
This man is a genius
---
I got a legendary fixer from a Beckett mission to retrieve a weapon case.  I've actually gotten a few decent weapons from those side missions.
---
Yup this is the top method - alternative location is Morgantown as there are many ghouls there too and I often find I need a break for the Whitespring. Generally speaking you'll be overstocked on Glow/Hardened Mass as the high rad fluids are more rare. I'll usually get approx 100 each (selling surplus to vendor) from a 2 hour nuke zone on private server. the stabilizing mats are heavy so I keep them on an alt and use that alt to stabilize the raw flux collected from nuke zones. Do not forget to equip super duper rank three when stabilizing!
---
*Cries in 5mm*
---
This doesn't necessarily piss them off. Sometimes they just want to see what a high player is using. I do this at level 450+ I have no intention of trading, just looking.
---
I do a lot of power leveling &amp; legendary farming, I'm not sick of it yet :)
---
Level 694 @380 hours.
---
I murdered one of Rocksy's other hunters the other day because he was a legendary.
---
Yeah, they've slowly been adding more places where the Purveyor's drop list gets used. Fasnacht used it, Colossal Problem does, the dailies from allies do. There's probably more places I don't know of, too, but my point was it doesn't get used for enemy drops.
---
I love spending 2000 rounds to get a 1\* junkie's bone..... :(
---
I could say the same
---
What’s his name? Give him that shout out he deserves
---
Tbh if it ain’t turtle 🐢 it ain’t quality
---
Fingers crossed we get something like this when the BoS comes back and they have their own reputation rewards
---
One workaround is using a private server to complete it. If you are on PS4 and need access to a private server for it, let me know and I can bring you onto mine.
---
This was a day 1 complaint, good luck getting anything from Bethesda.
---
I honestly wouldn't care if I got a 1 star item from a 3 star legendary, as long as it wasn't crap. If they would take out garbage like wood armor, rolling pins, lead pipes, etc. from a 3 star drop, I would make a Cultist sacrifice to RNGesus.

---
FYI, if you are interested in raider power armor you get a full set through the main questline.
---
enemies respawn when you server hop. PA doesn't always spawn. And if it does it can be random pieces of random types.
---
when you pick something up in the game or loot a container it goes on a list. Once you reac a certain number of items the first thing on the list is then available to be picked up again. And so on and so on. unofficial numbers are 180 and 255. Through my own testing i can tell you it is not 180 and definitely 255 or above. BUT i do not know if PA is counted. I know things like bobbleheads and magazines aren't.
---
what platform are you on?
---
what we need is just a repeating challenge that gives us scrip for killing legendaries and get it over with then we can go to purveyor and pick 1 2 3 star gear and what kind of grouping we want 
---
in fact I would push it even farther and say they should just make it so we can choose a weapon type or armor type and make more craftable legendaries as well and just end the search for them in the random grass
---
Yeah, I've never experienced this before. I'm wondering if I misread the plan and it's actually something else... lol. But I can't find any Colossus related items in my camp build. Other than the rug which I already have. Oh well, I get it again I suppose...
---
TBH the loot in it is okay, it's scrap and other common stuff. I think the most interesting thing I've gotten from the chest is 100 caps. You are better off quickly looting as many wendigos as you can before the cave collapses to get those loose screws.
---
Just buy it from a player vendor. It's easier and less grindy.
---
I've seen plenty of them for sale, for varying different prices too, so shop around.
---
All the comments I've seen are you being an ass. If you don't like the game don't harass the community, simple
---
Had a glitch with a workshop the other day that was actually already owned, but the map didn't recognize it at all. Wasn't paying attention when it popped up that I was taking it. Didn't realize what was going on until it was taking too long to claim it.
---
So, when we got our new icon, it freaked me out while claiming a workshop. Halfway through claiming I checked the map and it was someone else's icon on the workshop. So, I left and as I was loading out I went "oh, it's my new icon" lol.
---
Pc
---
Why don’t you just finish it? I recently did it in about 3 days, several hours. It’s not really that long, esp if you’re high level it’s pretty easy to breeze through. No point wasting all the treasury notes you could have!
---
Yeah, I'm guessing the code was chosen for its sound, not the actual content. The encoded BOS messages show Bethesda's capable of doing ARG-lite stuff if they want to.
---
I wanna hear them soggy bottom boys
---
Oh damn... Neat!
---
Very kind of you.
---
On Xbox, holding B will get you out
---
Public events reward scrip if you have not yet completed the vault 79 raid.
---
When meatweek redux happens (in a couple weeks, IIRC)  make sure you do the event as often as you can.  If they don’t change the format, you will get (scrip or Treasury notes), and a level appropriate legendary item (armor or weapon), if the event completes sucessfully.  
---
If you just want low level stuff to turn in for scrip, the event near Tyler Fairgrounds... leader of the pack... usually has 4 legendary wolves.
---
Uranium fever has 3.  Theres 1-5 in the whitesprings cottage loop.
---
Power Armor Carcass 🤘
---
Oh ok smelting and selling gotcha gotcha
---
Man why is rad chicken not a thing anyways
---
It's the eyes.
---
Remind what it was I accused you of?
---
That doesn't seem right, I've done multiple queens in the past couple days that were always 3*
---
Yeah I might remove that as it sort of tangents from the post a bit I think.
---
Yeah, I can agree. I don't mind that there is commie stuff, but the content is leaning a little too heavily to that side lately. I know they were shooting for a GI Joe/Cobra deal, but I would have personally preferred BoS/Enclave instead of more USA/China stuff.
---
I’m in your boat. This game has a lot of issues, but at the end of the day, I have a blast playing it. And that’s all that matters.
---
If you can even find the body... Really wish they'd implement a marker or something where the legendaries bodies drop. (Like the 'x's that pop up on the map on rdr2 when you kill stuff.) It sucks when you can't even get your loot bc the bodies just disappear or the pieces like, roll away, lol. I know bloody mess is probably to blame, but still.
---
Is it not? Embarrassing... Look yh it made sense in my head xD
---
How are they sticking their hand down your pocket?  You opened your wallet willingly.  
---
If you had looked in the appropriate places for news you would've known about this issue.

I want to upvote because of the 10 Things I Hate About You reference but you're at 76 upvotes right now and I think that's quite appropriate for this sub.

Oh Jesus thank you

Where at exactly? Far as I know only places you can get them is the quest line and the overseers house.

Nooo it's fkn awesome and that's the only thing I will call it from now on. 😆

So... what about that one week in between of no SCORE system? Are dailys/weeklies going to vanish that week or go back to giving us atoms?
---
What is the real thing called though xD
---
#Absolutely NOT
---
That Icon is one of the only good rewards as far as I'm concerned.  I cant wait to use the mildly infuriated comminist
---
How can anyone be "pushing themselves over the limit" doing challenges that take a few seconds or minutes for cosmetics in a video game?  If you do not feel the rewards are worth your time you can choose to not do the activity.  Either you want the rewards enough to put in the minuscule amount of effort required or you don't.
---
Imaginary laser guns in this videogame make sound. Why no imaginary attachment for imaginary gun to not make sound?
---
Is this clearer for you?
---
Yep!! Also just in case you don't know, as you're trading in, you can hit whatever button it is to buy or sell, then tap b to go back and select buy/sell again, instead of going through the normal 6 or so screens to get back there. If that makes sense
---
For future reference, the currency is called Scrip. it's used at the purveyor in the rusty pick in case you didn't know
---
ah. if it was xbone i could have made you a set.
---
You would think that with the chicken coop, it would be.
---
Not to brag or anything but a got a 2 star bloodied rolling pin from Earle 😎
---
&gt;Do things swing the other way such that mid to high level events scale down sufficiently enough that that makes up for the loss of these low level events?
---
Why do I have to actively search for an issue when it still charges me? Surely something like this should have been within the game or the page to purchase it? Imagine going to mcdonalds and buying a burger only to get nothing and the guy says "oh did you check our blog sir?"
---
I had no idea about this. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
---
Power armor chassis
---
Every time you go back to Charleston capitol building to farm ghouls make sure to activate the departments , (I do one going in and one on the way out)  you’ll get all the ghouls spawn again including J47.
---
I frequently get 2 legendaries included in the spawns
---
"Fear of Missing Out" is created entirely in your mind and is not real.  Anyone can stop doing anything at any time they choose.  If you are suffering from 'FOMO' that is a personal issue and shows a lack of willpower.
---
What? Me accusing you of going against a small change to something? If you don't like small changes that benefit players then you are the reason why we never get any QoL changes
---
i did uranium fever on an alt at level 8 or something. just kept tagging mobs. Didn't die or even come close. I mean it helped that there were 3 or 4 other people there.
---
There isn’t. They’re confusing it with the other types.
---
Because it's not like you're going to get nothing.  It will just be delayed.
---
I want a rad chicken companion
---
In regards to Centralia, the town dug a pit to use as a landfill. When making a pit for this purpose, a layer of non-flammable material must be laid down, like concrete, so imagine a big swimming pool.
---
The town half-assed this part, leaving some areas in the pit with little or no concrete. They then lit the landfill on fire when it got full, and the fire was able to spread to a coal seam located near the compromised portion of the pit.
---
The town then spent two decades and tens of millions of dollars in another half assed attempt to control the fires (Which obviously failed)
---
I see why i mixed that up... I have no idea what that word means so i just remebered one that i know the meaning of xD guess imma visit the holy google translator once again
---
By trophies I mean like “I was there” status symbols. For instance people who played in the first year got an outfit. People generally seem to respond very well to those bragging rights things. 
---
A “where did you get that cool thing?”  
---
B "I played season 1 you season 4 noob”    
---
A “jeez no need to be a jackass about it”
---
B “get rekt son”
---
I think you did great!
---
Thanks for posting this!  I scrapped my helmet accidentally about one-hundred levels ago. :)
---
No I am not. The problem is people fast travel way to much and don’t take the time to explore the world. 
---
Found it in the Ash Heap.
---
Im aware of that now but at the time of purchase there was nothing and there was nothing either on the games page that would suggest otherwise, at no point was I told it would be here later, if I wanted to know that I would have had to actievly search for that, theres no mention of such a bug even being in the game on the game either.
---
Unless you're doing the quests of Rose for Wastelanders (Year 2), you're going well.  
---
The game can be a bit puzzling right now since Rose is used in the questline for both years content (overseer year 1 and wastelanders year 2) so it can be fairly easy to get lost.  
---
Be sure to follow the Overseer questline, you'll come back to Rose later eventually, for wastelanders.
---
I’m guessing what has a line through it are the words “and they’ll ignore it” since they’ve been pretty bad about taking feedback. I still find it funny after a year of the game being out they finally figured out the majority of Fallout players never wanted PvP (I’m more ok with it now than I was at release). If they are finally listening to the community, maybe we can have some balance that doesn’t wreck melee builds and maybe makes Berserker builds worth while outside of stealth Berserkers.
---
OMFG IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE hahhahhah
---
Im happy to wait, I just wish something was on the games homescreen itself like "currently we are having issues with *etc etc*"
---
I think you take no fall damage after fast traveling or spawning. My old camp was on a cliff and I usually spawned in the air, but never died that way.
---
Broke my legs every time though, lol.
---
This one is very perplexing.  The blood eagles really stand out.  Beams of red gatling laser fire or the unmistakable chug-chug-chug of a .50 cal machine gun spitting out death towards you yields a short hunting rifle when you loot the corpse.  Huh???
---
&gt;1) Plague doctor mask should prevent diseases much like a gas mask. It just makes sense to me, plus I always have it on.
---
Why? Actual ones didn't. The only purpose they served was giving doctors a smoking incense reservoir right near their nose to block out the smell of plague victims.
---
I agree with your other points, though. More flexibility in modding weapons is a good thing.
---
😂❤️
---
I thought the trick was to angle your camera down and then boost so that you fall slowly and time it so that you are boosting from the moment you hit it until you reach the ground.  It mostly works for me but every now and then, it doesn't.
---
This is the first day I have really played with it for any length of time so I appreciate your help!
---
Idk how people die all the time, I never died from heights since I have the jet pack.
---
The thing is that you cannot let your character accelerate pass certain velocity, since after passing a certain point in falling speed your jet pack will hardly slow you down.
---
Can you post a link?
---
I put all my ammo factories under the map.
---
Just under my junk extractor. ( So you don't notice the sound)
---
And I always remove the stairs when leaving my camp.
---
🌝😘
---
What was the old system?
---
Forgive me for not knowing, I started playing this year (level 130). What are these abbreviations on guns I see thrown around? BE? 2525? Thanks
---
JFC, would I even recognize this game anymore since I haven’t played since the start of Wastelanders or is it still **exactly** the same with some aesthetic rewards?
---
I'll be trying so later on but it seems that it may be some sort of bug atm.
---
Clucks when it finds various flora at the cost of eating 1 out of 10 that it finds.
---
Ty for the advice.
---
Yea, definitely mix it up. Most of the plans I have I got from workshop events. You should also try to visit player vendors that have a lot of plans up because I'm not the only one selling even more rare plans for 30c or less.
---
I kind of forget about them and eventually throw them away.
---
Lvl 96 here. I get a lot and I like giving stuff away so, I drop them to low levels or if I have free space in my vendors, I 0 cap them.
---
Sure thing :)
---
Yes. That’s the point, so low levels. Can do more stuff.
---
The sitting outside works on uranium fever as well. I can't take that siren anymore. It's not worth it for level 35 gear. But that Savage "D" drop is worth it.
---
I have like 100 of them, I drop them off occasionally at wayward.
---
From what I hear purchasing through steam means it could be delayed anyways.  I hope you're giving them the same treatment and words that you are giving Bethesda.
---
It feels like something changed. I died  
---
this way too recently and I haven't changed my way of landing, that worked perfectly for months.
---
Well if you haven't seen the medical goggles there is also the BoS hood, flight helmet and welding helmet.
---
Umm... I think the PTS forum has this covered. I haven't seen anything here all that much different to what is there.
---
A whole bunch of knee jerk reactions of (mostly bloodied builds) crying about their damage numbers getting smaller. This is followed by posts of people actually testing it and realising that (bugs aside) the changes aren't that big of a deal in terms of effective gameplay &amp; that the build meta will mostly be unchanged with bloodied still at the top.
---
What could you add that wasn't one of these two? Even with our feedback. It's either "muh numbahs! Reeeee!" or "eh, it doesn't change much".
---
put them in vendor for 1 cap each
---
Yeah, I just read about that too.  Good luck with your 1st!
---
Mix that with cloaking or chameleon armor, and it would make for an amazing melee stealth build.
---
Yes, yes indeed. this is why I am trying to get a VFFRFR Ultracite Gatling Laser. 1k shots per fusion core sounds infinitely more appealing than going through absurd amounts of 5mm
---
I drop them. I hate clogging up my menus with stuff I don’t use.
---
finally, someone asked this question. No idea but they seem to have vanished from the PTS and website :(
---
Plasma ammo is such a pain to get too.
---
You can sometimes get it from the firebreathers in front of big bend tunnel.
---
There is a subreddit for FO76 market transactions. Not sure I can link to it but you'll get more traction there, probably.
---
On a dresser in The Sludge Works. Towards the back in a open shack iirc
---
Ty, hopefully it comes in before end of the season
---
I didn't even do anything with them when I was low level cuz I didn't know any better 😬 now I do but I don't bother. I'm sure I have a bunch in my inventory, I just don't pay attention to them
---
I am having the exact same issue
---
I’ve seen people request the aid drop and then wait for other players to open them and become wanted.
---
I guess the topic at hand is, at level 8, would you have been able to kill one of the mole miners by yourself?
---
yea I agree with you on this one, plague doctor masks were kind of useless other than nice smelling incense hahaha
---
I did the same thing!! I felt accomplished :)
---
Two pieces of fall armor does 100% prevention of damage, and leaves those two slots open for useful perks.
---
Of course I am, I'm not hating on bethesda for the sake of having some sort of agenda against them, all I want is the service I paid for or at least for there to have been some prior warning to purchase it, steam handled the transaction so if anything I find them more accountable, but I still wish we got some sort of daily news system in game to make players aware of issues etc.
---
*Monkey paw finger closed*
---
Granted! 
---
You now only receive 3* rolling pins.
---
Drink some water bud!
---
B stands for bloodied, the E is for explosive, 25% could be less vats costs or firerate. 
---
There are more than just these 3 but youll "learn" them with relative ease
---
I request the drop. Scrap is scrap.
---
Something sort of did; in a Quakecon interview, it was mentioned that a post-launch PvP event was scrapped as PvP had a poor reception. Race for the President was a PvP focused event that's essentially been untouched for a year or more.
---
Yes, this and pip-boy colors.  Seems plausible
---
I dunno why you told me to drink some water but funny thing, I’m actually sitting here drinking a cold bottle of water, just went for a 1/8th of a mile jog and back.
---
Unfortunately Fallout 76 has never really had a good knack for handling those bragging rights trophies. That year one outfit covered anyone playing in about the first 17 months, nothing unique for those actual beta guys playing first when the game sucked. For their limited time events such as Fasnacht and meat week they have recycled the rewards each year and made your prior hard fought trophies less rare. The only things that have not been recycled yet are the limited time NW rewards (although they were accidentally reactivated a while back, but that did not appear to be intentional).
---
Sadly the best way to mark that you were here back then is to buy every single piece of atomic shop content and hope to display some of the rare ones that take a really long time to cycle back.
---
Yes i would love this. Its possible with mining helmets already. So it should be possible with the pipboy.
---
Fix ALL the buggs and remove all legacy/cheated weapons and armor
---
Mmm. Bitter tears.
---
Oh for sure.  Not meant to be contradictory to your point, more of an FYI for those who might not know.  Cheers!
---
You need max Settler rep for the plan to appear
---
I knew it was supposed to have been patched, but I’ve had it accidentally agro me recently so I figured I’d throw it out there on the off chance that it might, MIGHT, happen to them. Thank you for reminding me.
---
At the very least I feel like they shouldn't drop 1 star equipment.
---
This is pretty interesting and thanks for doing this. I run a bloody stealth commando, and I have a friend that runs a bloody stealth pistol. B2525 handmade versus B2525 10mm. I don’t remember the numbers he was throwing out when we were comparing dps. For the most part we’re both wearing the same armor, and not using any chem or food buffs. But I do remember that his 10mm, with a good perk set up and full unyielding sneak set, was comparable to the handmade. With buffs, however the handmade starts to leave the pistol in the dust. Regardless it was pretty interesting nonetheless.
---
I just realized today i haven’t played for almost two weeks now, after finishing season 1. Thinking about it but then..... nope, I’ll do something else. I did play NW for the first time because of score, and i kind of miss that, so i might do just for fun!
---
Chest no longer has the unique rewards, just caps and some ore. Rewards are given right to yout character.
---
Mask has a 5% chance to drop.
---
I responded to someone saying it correctly that the chase power armor skin would be cool.
---
Yeah I tried to post it there, but it kept telling me my title was wrong and wouldn’t let me post. So I tried here. But any help would be appreciated thanks.
---
Aggro during PvP or PvE?
---
That's a Dick move
---
It just works x16
---
There's no cure, but if you completed the responder quest line then you completed the inoculation.
---
Which is what? My reputation bar won't go up anymore
---
Bloodied Explosive. Go look up a legendary perk chart and the prefix acronyms speak for themselves.
---
I know you're talking about planting them, but incase you or anyone needs to see this: A good forest spot for pumpkins is the Aaronholt Homestead. To the south westish of the houses and barn is the farm land. 10 good cranberries is closest food to the location but if you head towards the shack on your right, you'll see a dilapidated shack by a junk pile, hay barrels, to the left higher up on the hill. Over by it are 3 carrots and A BUNCH of pumpkins. Load in, run to the barn and look right at it. Houses to your leftish, so you wanna turn right and head down the little gravel road and that will take you right to the cranberries. It's that plot if land. There's another broken down.shack and more hay barrels to more west of the homestead, so not to get confused with that. Once you're at the cranberries, you won't go downhill again collecting all the food. Maybe an incline, but that's it.
---
I've already completed the vault raid
---
The first season ends on the 8th.
---
The formatting is a bit stringent, yeah. I'll message you.
---
You have to be allies with them.
---
How do I do that?
---
You’re supposed to be “Ally” at the end, not neighbourly
---
I agree 100%.
---
Ive completed the raid already though
---
One more than neighborly, start doing dailies for them.
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I have had a dream of selling nothing but firebreather outfits in the ash heap. You have made my dream possible :)
---
I don’t ever pvp. Never has appealed to me in this game and I’m one of those people who thinks it doesn’t belong in Fallout. I also don’t take workshops. This happened at random. Granted, most of the time my mutations won’t trigger pvp, but when this did I just figured Bethesda broke something with an update.
---
Yeah I learned this during third event being the loot from chest sucks I don’t even worry about leaving
---
Go find ward, he should have daily missions for you, log in every day and do it until you level up again.
---
You keep doing the daily quest for the settlers (Vital Equipment) and turning in photos of Crater to Foundation's leader for Davenport's daily (you start this by talking to him in the Overseer's basement) to get enough reputation to be allied with Foundation.
---
Ghouls in the Burrows don't drop the fluids. There is plenty enemies around Harpers Ferry though, great for Flux also. If you need fluids, Nuke Morgantown.
---
I've done it each day but my bar doesn't move at all
---
8th then 15th
---
Enemies, loot containers, boxes in a wide variety of locations. Theres usually 3-4 boxes in the overseers garage.  buy from player vendors.  Craft it.
---
It will take time to collect/craft a big supply (where big= more than 1k).
---
Try to use melee weapons when possible - great way to conserve ammo :)
---
Then you should be aware that ESO does the exact opposite in terms of roles.  I can make my DK tank into a healer or DPS with ease.  This system is the exact opposite in that if you try to build a tank you will be sacrificing the ability to make that toon anything else.  
---
First and One Wasteland might be like ESO but the legendary perk system is nothing at all like what ESO has as champion points are cheaply respecced and do not require you to eliminate perks.
---
&gt; But I'm sure we've enough folks who've played the PTS but didn't write in the bethesda forum.
---
And the reason is that u/valseek's employer chose to ignore the feedbacks for more than the most parts.
---
I personally have grown tired of opening tickets, writing mails, or even contacting the mods/managers directly. **IIFF** there was a reply it was one of two text modules "Thanks for feedback we'll hand it to the devs" or " " and the tickets were closed. And their marketing calls this "communication" with their playerbase.
---
The only thing that looked cool was the fire place
---
It might be bugged, but I noticed it kind of tends to move in fits and spurts
---
YOOOO...!!!...I heard you like RNG so I put RNG in your RNG so you can RNG your RNG!!!
---
-Confucius (probably)
---
I know exactly what you're talking about, FD armor really helps but still, what silly thing when it happens.
---
No they nerfed the shit out of riflemen so it now does the same dmg as commando
---
I still have mine as I absolutely love the Firebreather outfit, but thank you for posting this as in case I somehow do lose my set I now have a backup.
---
Yeah that’s true. But you seem to be forgetting that legendary roles are random. So for those of us who don’t feel like grinding scrip for the very small chance of getting not one, but two, at least half decent armor pieces with the fall damage perk, Goat Legs is a viable option.
---
yay :p
---
It's hard to get it to fit into t he rest of a base though.
---
There is a ginseng close to where you load in at bolton greens. Immediately loading, I always run down to the first big rock, basically straight in front of you, for height to shoot the scorched walking on the roof. Then I go over to the other rock by the tree to get the scorched on the balcony and behind the sign. It's right by that rock and tree.
---
We had them in beta, but you’re not thinking like a griefer. If you could directly control where someone spawned in, you could lay a trap so people died and dropped all their junk potentially. I think that’s the consensus on why it isn’t a thing anymore.
---
I agree. The difference is that it only works with UF if others are actually doing the event, but that's usually not a problem.
---
You don't need to die. Just loot wendigos until the 'escape the mine' countdown ends and you will be TPd outside
---
Ok being honest, I kinda wish that was the actual size of the zone. I've mentioned to a friend before on how it could work, the inner circle being the drop point having the highest levels of radiation, and as you go away from the center, the rads arent as heavy. Itd help with getting flux as well since you have a much larger area to work with. Camps closer to the blast receive more damage, while camps near the edge receive less to none.
---
I never forgot that roles are random. Simply buy from a vendor or trade online via a sub reddit.
---
We have the fast spawn welcome mat for workshops.  Why not camps?
---
Y'all are going to hate me but ever since update 20 every 3 star has dropped 3 star, 2 star drops 2 star and 2 star drops 1 star on my Main Character. He has 7 Luck so I don't know if that contributes to reliability of drops or not.
---
Is this even a question? You know how toxically patriotic commies are.
---
Reset them to make useless but heavy ammo. Enjoy your railway spikes.
---
Makes sense. Thank you! Turns out I have a BE Fixer! Sweet
---
Thanks so much!
---
That would ruin the value of collected legendaries.  Imagine how terrible you would feel if you've been collecting them since bata and now they're all worthless.
---
They might just outright ban you, the more people it’s effecting the more likely to do a blanket ban.
---
This. Source: The game’s sign in screen ;)
---
It ends on the 8th. But if you come up short on landing any of the 'utility items,' like the coop, they will also be available to buy with gold bullion.
---
;)
---
I mean, it’s not really a big deal to me. I just thought it’d be nice to have a more “fashionable” gas mask. Considering how many other things are *cough* unrealistic in this game I thought people would let it slide.
---
What’s your platform?
---
I have carnivore recipei, and try to keep at least 1 serum in my vendor at all times.  I think I have a stray grounded I’ll likely not use.
---
recpes are only sold by modus, for 17k each
---
PSA for everyone who missed the news:
---
look at your weekly challenges timer. That is when the Legendary Run (season 1) ends. when the timer reaches 00:00:00, Season 1 is over and any unclaimed prizes are lost.
---
I've been casually looking for the plans.  I tried all the train stations this morning and didn't find them.
---
I’m not 100% they know what they are doing they are about to release the update and a lot of things don’t seem right to me
---
What is SCORE?
---
Your best bet is with grahm. Couldnt find them at all for a while but during meat weak i saw 2 plans on him. Only bought one.
---
Good luck, I just hope you are playing on steam from the get go, and not on an older, linked account.
---
The doubled Dailies and Weeklies this week is awesome! Hopefully they continue doing things like that.
---
It is from an older account, does that complicate things?
---
It depends what event you're talking about.  There will still be stuff too hard for low levels in the game.
---
Youre welcome
---
Yes it is.
---
I had a few more than I thought I should last night but I’m a FO1st member because I forgot to cancel it after I used it to make a new character to play with my friend, and we’ll I didn’t think about it. It wasn’t quite 1.5 million extra though so maybe I just racked up some atoms from gameplay I didn’t realize is my hope.
---
The vault raid means nothing. You can rush that as soon as possible. I did my vault raid when I was at cautious. With foundation. 
---
After neighbourly there’s another level called ally. That’s when you can buy the fertilizer thing.
---
It could def be useful for some people! I personally prefer enjoy using paper for this though. I might make a spreadsheet but idk if I would use a companion app or not 🤔 I would give it a shot anyway!
---
No clue
---
Yes it does, because those accounts have 2 wallets. One with steam and one with Beth.
---
Linked accounts should always buy F1st and atoms via Beth's interface/launcher, not via steam. Because Atoms and F1st are not transferable.
---
Yes. 
---
Even if it was bugged, it doesn’t auto equip
---
Want more time in game? Unlock the caps, script, gold blocks. No they want to limit how fast you can go through content. They already can not keep up.
---
It's good, was just a joke that the mags are a BEAR to find compared to the bobbleheads. I'd have to check but I think I'm missing 4 still after some light grinding. I'm 'only' about 1200 hours.
---
Mm. And I guess everyone is just supposed to have a huge hoard of caps for buying any and all items that strike their fancy, right? Perk cards are free. Is there anything else you would like to add or can you just accept that there are other people in the world who want to do things differently than you. Thanks 😁
---
Simple solution - if you die in a camp then you don't drop your loot. Similar to events.
---
I found a fire breather helmet in ash heap in a little tent
---
Plan: Sentence Structure
---
Bobblehead: Inventory Organizer
---
Serum: Why not have this same structure for naming Serums to enhance stash organization?
---
it's actually not a valid question, because it's been asked and answered about 100 times already.
---
I'm just suggesting a viable option that allows those cards to be put to better use. You don't have to do it. To each their own.
---
As I recall, I did break my legs yes. I was kind of surprised that I still had health, but my legs were shattered.
---
No thanks
---
Aimlessly roaming and killing stuff, waiting out time gates for Smiley, waiting out time gates for scrip. Need about 1400 more gold to complete my SS armor, so still hunting T-notes...
---
There are spawns for full sets that have voicelines in them when you enter in random locations. I found one at the far south end of savage divide and one west of the red rocket mega stop.
---
I'll do it if I'm close and remember. Or doing that vigilant event..
---
I'm a hoarder so I'll take everything.. Scrap it, drop it if I don't need it.
---
No.
---
it happened a couple of times many weeks ago (pre and post Wastelanders) if I remember correctly.  
---
Annoying, but not a big issue. (IMO)
---
I e never seen a queen below a 3*
---
I wasnt aware of that, I did know that moving the account over would mean loosing my atoms but a friend has done the same and their first worked fine.
---
Street justice
---
I'm going to have to remember that, because for the life of me I could never remember where I found it, and I've been wanting to go get more. There are a lot of people I wish to call a dumbass.
---
:O
---
I drop them and once in a while I will use them.  
---
Same thing for treasure maps.
---
Agreed. Don't wanna be an ass but I think OC is talking out of me
---
After you finish the raid the grind just begins. You have to do dailies from them to get it up. It’s a really long slow grind
---
Star Trek parody would be fucking awesome
---
trap camps
---
&gt; please fix. Thank you
---
Consider it done.
---
Kidding aside, this is the wrong forum for this. You need to open a ticket with Beth.
---
The nukest of them all.
---
Move your module around. you spawn in a northerly direction of it.
---
If you were doing a public event, thats why.  
---
Couple patches ago, you no longer drop junk on death at a public event.  
---
Anyplace else though, you still drop it.
---
I’ve been max for a long time. I can’t pick anymore up but I don’t think I used one for the last year and a half
---
It's really more complicated than that.
---
Yup I won’t be keeping that to heavy to keep thanks
---
Have no fear! They are placing rewards from Season 1 into the gold bullion exchange. You will be able to buy rewards you weren’t able to get with gold bullion. Might take a few weeks to get the gold required, but at least they are giving people the opportunity to get the prizes they missed.
---
Ah sadly it might take awhile to get them since to make them respawn you have to collect 180 world items and loot 60 world containers... 
---
But I know of a way to help you along with that. There’s a house in Summerville that has 300 burnt books you can loot, not counting the other stuff in the house. And for the containers you just have to loot 60 bodies.
---
I'd like one for my plasma caster too.
---
[I got it from this](https://imgur.com/a/qv1gwAZ)

Eventually
---
I had all modded gear and weapons from my main
---
It's honestly quite pathetic that the damage calculations have been bugged for almost 5 years going on now and Bethesda refuses to fix the core problem at all.
---
They don't weight anything. I always sell them for 1cap each at my vendor, so people how still need SCORE for the daily buying 3 items from an other player. Sells very well tbh. Same for bobbypins
---
Ass dmg peoples builds getting fucked=more complicated if Bethesda knows it’s fucked they shouldn’t be releasing it those two builds shouldn’t have similar dmg neither should a unarmed build do so ass with so much dmg perks and preparation
---
Even if I can't agree more, 99% is a little bit too much ;) Bethesda, you know... that sort of things ^^
---
The pipe pistol out-damages the 10mm, especially if you're comparing the non-auto versions. Very cool that you factored in reload time though. Also good to see the fixer and handmade compared, I was wondering about that.
---
maybe cuz u a firebreather?
---
I just tried it and it works perfectly.

No problem!
---
All I'm saying is that they aren't nerfing any type of weapon really.  The more damage modifiers you have, the worse you get hit.  Which means the more damage you do, the worse you get hit.
---
Same for me
---
What’s be
---
I know that but the way my camp is It will still spawn me off the edge being able to have a specific spawn point would be alot nicer
---
Yes but said nerfing has made some builds useless and some just not work how they should
---
What's hard for me are the other components.
---
Honestly a bigger nuke should be beautiful to see!
---
They already seem to be watering down the rewards splitting up mask and outfit. Nukashine and radx as rewards?!
---
Oh ok. I just thought that since other people where reporting bugs on this reddit, it was appropriate to post this.
---
*me thinking I'm done grinding fallout*
---
"Oh snap, they got a foosball machine?..."
---
so if the cliff is in a northern direction you want to place it as far south as possible. You doing that? 
---
And until trap camps are completely wiped from existence it'll never happen.
---
it does by small increments, it took me 6 months of doing the Raiders dailies (both of them and siding with them after the wastlanders quest, plus random encounters) to be allies with them. So its a really long slow grind to get anywhere with either and harder with settlers since they only have 1 daily mission that im aware of and doing the Davenport quest as well  :/
---
Yeah I tried upvoteing it but only made it zero so I felt worse 😥
---
Who?  "Useless" I doubt it.  And yes unarmed is broken, but being close to fixed.
---
I get the feeling one person was writing those, and got wronged by Bethesda. It's so out of date it's not even useful.
---
He’s plus 1
---
When did Bethesda respond? I’ve only seen snarky comments from people who assume one way or the other.
---
Ahhh yes great r/fo76 same fucking post for 35\*0924094289ı50245 time in 2 year and still got 12 awards and 1k upvote is this place becoming r/Karma4Free next time I am gonna post this If any of you post it I will commit war crimes in balkans

I had a dude show up at the silo as I was at 75% on launch prep, he power armor glitched in bc I watched him drop out of the ceiling in the control room. Told him to leave he decided not to. Then he tries to put his key card in before me, fortunately I was quicker. So I start targeting and I keep hearing “ access denied” as he keeps trying to put his key card in. So I went ahead found his camp, sent the last nuke on server on top of it. He messages me that it was a waste of a nuke and all he was trying to do was help, I told him not to me you little cheater, your level 121 and I’m 307, you really think I need your help?
---
Pick up "Fix it Good" under INT, max card allows you to repair to 200%.
---
Pick up "White Knight" under AGI, max rank greatly reduces the materials needed for repair.
---
Swap both in when you need to repair your gear and drop lucky break for a better qol or damage perk. I usually make it through a couple multi hour plays before I need to repair, using FiG and WK.
---
Even when lucky break is working properly, to me it never seemed worth the 3 luck slots. I ran both perks for some time in the early game, but soon found a better strategy to keep my gear in good shape.
---
It is. That's why there's a "bug" flair.
---
As a new player how do I gain atoms, I started the last few days and I earned atoms and legendary run stuff
---
For me it is, which do you use (if any)?
---
It doesn't seem too bad on the pts.
---
I know team members share the loot so it's first come, first served. It might apply to anyone at the event also but I haven't tested that. It might be worth testing if they count as lootable containers and only restock after you've looted enough other ones.
---
You didn’t get downvoted for not liking exploits. You got downvoted because you were being rude and confrontational. Someone asked you to explain what you meant by ‘zombies’ and you had an attitude about it. 
---
It wasn’t the topic that got you downvoted. It was your presentation and tone.
---
It’s kind of annoying because I’m always on the hunt for dog food, so I accept any and all trades to check chems. I have a few desired weapons so, people ignore what I requested or list theirs in high hopes I’ll sell mine for a price like theirs And all I’m after is dog food. 
---
If that makes any sense lol
---
Yeap clear as crystal
---
It's the Prefix and major effect of the weapon or in this case Bloodied explosive
---
I’ve gotten some seriously good three stars from it so they have me hooked. Ended up getting a JE90 fixer from the final reward. I don’t care about the event rewards or treasury notes but the legendary rolls keep me coming back.
---
Seen a post on the pts some dude was doing 330ish with buffs from food and having a great bloodied unarmed build with Bethesda trying to balance they’ve completely removed the risk/reward from bloodied builds
---
Fandom still says you can buy the scout mask from MODUS.
---
when Season 1 started, Bethesda was very clear about the daily atom challenges going away.
---
Farming nuke zones for high radiation fluids whenever a nuke zone pops up.   Flux and the two masses are no problem, but I'd like to have a cushion of HRF stored up.   Dropped a nuke on Morgantown myself yesterday, but my console froze up right as I lined up the first shot on a scorched.   When I reconnected, I didn't go back to the same sever even though I was on a team.  :(     Oh well.   Next time.
---
We saved him
---
What’s your build/weapon
---
You can do account/character related challenges.
---
The main way to “earn” them now is by doing the legendary run. Although you don’t earn a lot.
---
You're as dry as the Sahara Desert in your screen caps!  :D
---
Also the Pristine Nuka machine shares beverages with the punch bowl so you can have both out with the same contents.
---
Yes, unarmed is broken, that little damage wasn't intended.  It's being fixed.
---
Oh wow.
---
Want a nocturnal pipe pistol?
---
And again

daily atoms instead of score points.

Heavy gunner, on pts I used bloodied gauss minigun
---
More like being a bitch
---
Then everything good would be common and I couldn't show off to noobs. Imma pass.
---
Maybe if it's limited to only **you** fast traveling to **your** camp. That should hopefully not attract grief-ing.
---
I know but it's empty for both
---
Haha no thanks
---
vendor camps. someone will be selling it. a combination of buying, ammo converter, and crafting should keep you supplied.
---
It makes more heavy guns viable, makes commando reloads stupidly fast. And hilarious to watch the speed at trying to reload a dragon, still too slow to use but funny to see the sped up animation.
---
Ghoul slayer’s gamma gun?
---
there are lifetime challenges you can do. if you just started, there are many available for you.
---
Still waiting for my junkies explosive rolling pin with faster swing speed.  I'm sure it's out there given the number and variations of rolling pins that have dropped for me....
---
All melee will be trash now?   Even power fists?
---
They’ve already “fixed” it unless they just said fuck it and are gonna release them broken which is classic Bethesda
---
Troubleshooters is extra damage against bots, so ya, it would shred a Gutsy.  BTW, the AA is not too far behind when it comes to bots.
---
I used an executioners (combat rifle) from about L45-60.  Took down my first couple of SBs with it.  Executioners bonus does not kick in until your target Is below 50% health.
---
Pretty much. A simple search will show this discussed many times.
---
What you're describing was unintentional.  They want to buff unarmed compared to how it was in pts.
---
Best way to farm flux?..  put a mirror next to a weight bench, when Im done with my sets all I do is "farm flux".... FLUX!! *passes out from fluxing too hard
---
Leader of the Pack was already being done by high level players. Its a fast event that can drop rare forest plans, has quick scrip, and legendaries for daily's and weekly's.
---
Yeah - I seem to remember that, as there were a shit ton of posts from people complaining how ripped off they felt and how they thought it was a bethesdaconspiracy to ruin the game and take everyone's money.
---
Not sure about Solar Thorn since I haven’t worked on that yet, but you can have two mods on Secret Service Armor just like other armor. One to modify the DR/ER/RR and one to add a functionality feature. 
---
For example, I have Buttressed and Jet Pack on one of my Secret Service Chest Pieces.
---
What is causing you to think that you cannot have two mods?
---
Hey there, subscription fulfillments are currently delayed but will be active on your account soon.
---
Gauss minigun has the lowest nerf rate of all heavy weapons and it along with the .50 cal still do the most dmg and you only will see a 1-2 shot difference you have seen the lowest a bloodied build can be nerfed
---
as a lv. 222 on Xbox I usually just sell them for 5 caps a piece for low levels since my camp is rite by wayward cuz capitalism makes the world go round 😎
---
Thank you for updating the wiki, I used the wiki daily when I was first starting out in FO76. Still use it now, just not as much.

Ty, also ngl wasnt expecting a community manager, thanks for the update, any idea when that may be roughly?
---
Do get the fall damage reduction pieces. I have that setup, and it is MAGICAL!
---
If your having trouble hitting the damage cap at boss events to get drops, join a public team that is at the event.
---
Im not 100% on whether the damage cap gets spread across the whole team or aslong as one person hits the cap, everyone gets rewards.
---
But everytime Ive been in a public group at an event, ive been able to loot the boss whether I tagged it or not.
---
Just wait until it comes out and see for yourself.  There are no nerf rates, that doesn't make any sense.
---
That image is the "Future-Tec World Bundle" in the vaulting tab, available until the 8th.
---
Also, armor for female models should show some of da bewb.
---
Thanks to the mass dupe that’s recently happened. All once valuable weapons are now worthless anyways.
---
This could help balance the economy back out to a reasonable level. 
---
Imagine being a new player, reaching level 50+, only to find out you have to grind for months to still not get your weapon. You hear there’s places to trade, eg reddit. Only to find out you need either other god roll stuff or like a million caps to get what you want. 
---
I can see why a lot of people decide to give up, the RNG is just terrible.
---
No problem, thank you
---
Then, new players show up in the middle of collecting the venison and respawn the assaultron and sentry bot and everything goes to hell. Meanwhile, they run around randomly shooting things and not collecting venison while you die as you try to get back to Habitat-A.

I just want the train set and shooting gallery...
---
They why are they still trying to release patch 22 there’s only a short frame of time before the pts closes and they don’t have much longer before it would be dumb to put in the pts because they can’t get feed back fast enough
---
Shhh you didn't hear this from but theres a whole bunch more american stuff :)
---
It's not that hard to trade up.  I literally went from 30k caps and some meat week stuff to a legacy in a week.
---
I have a bunch of them in my inventory but have not used one in months.  They are okay at lower levels if you need some supplies but not so much later.
---
do the vital equipment and photo opportunity quests every day. take photos of crater and turn them in to foundation. donate your reward from vital equipment. it’s a grind. will take weeks.
---
When it ends you will not be able to put anymore junk in the scrapbox but you will be able to use the junk in it.If you are going to buy it i suggest a bit later because people are receantly saying you don't get free atoms by the end of the month because of some sort of glitch.
---
There’s weights in fire breather station, green county lodge near flatwoods, and a blood eagle camp towards the south of the ash heap. Those gives tons of lead but they are competitive.
---
If everyone is dead they cannot detect you
---
From randoms at least.  From reddit where you agree what you'll trade before hand it's fine.
---
I support this, but in a much larger cost method. 
---
Like you have to buy tickets or modules of some sort, have to save up to be able to do one star. So more then 1k scrip. And only for the 2nd two stars. Leave it abit harder with having to get a 3star with the primary you want first.
---
Stuff isn’t worth much anymore due to what’s just happened with the economy. I’d rather know that I can eventually got the ideal weapon for my build then to play the game for months and still not get it. 
---
Just look at how other games have been in the past, everyone eventually gets what they want from playing the game.
---
In a single player game like fallout 4, I'd agree. In an online grindathon like this where people will be putting in hundreds and even thousands of hours, it's nothing short of required
---
They would make the SBQ be a 1-2* enemy with a low chance of being 3*
---
When is supossed to be available?
---
I fixed it
---
smart, if you need the kill 20 players achieve real quick
---
My opinion is if you have the time, just do it.  I'd rather spend a little extra time than not and wish I had something that I can't.
---
Yes it does gauss minigun has a 38% nerf and the .50 has a 48% nerf those are the numbers it’s so low nerf for your weapon combined with fast fire rate you don’t notice it my .50 cal post patch will do 1-3 more shots on ghouls but someone’s bloodied DC gauntlet will do almost the same dmg as my .50 cal they still need to work a lot of things out imo they should delay the nerf so they can work on it being a full nerf/buff to some weapons/builds
---
Yes... during the season. They never mentioned anything explicitly about after the season. They were not clear.
---
Thank you
---
Perhaps. But they could be made available in any number of ways in the game - too easily. They shouldn't be stand-in rank rewards. Heck, if the intention is to be used for legendary perks, they could as well just give us a few coins directly.
---
Blessed be
---
Pretty much my issue. No common item should be.
---
reported!
---
I think it's today.. We did reach the amount of cloth required and like the Steel Dawn Fatigues they appeared in the shop the day after the deadline for donations ended
---
Edit: So when the Atomic Shop "Refreshes" at 10:30 AM (whatever time zone fallout 76 uses) we can claim it for free like the Fatigues
---
There is a lot of aluminum in the game. It's just that most players don't spend enough time learning what to pick up.
---
If you are in need of Aluminum, the quickest way to get it is to pick up all of the ski poles around Top of the World.  There is also a broken down truck near Tygart water treatment plant with a bunch of skis and ski poles.
---
Death and humiliation, I would imagine.
---
Sneak 100
---
That doesn't make any sense though.  Ignoring the broken unarmed weapons, damage recalculation works the same way.
---
That’s because legacy items are now common.
---
If you have enough time to play for hours every day, of course you’ll get it. 
---
What about casual players?
---
I’m a melee build and spend a lot of time killing ghouls at WS, so I am regularly infected with one disease or another.
---
When I was a low level, he impact hit my char fairly hard, so was always looking for disease cures, etc,
---
Now I’m High enough level that most disease have a negligible effect. More often than not, i just let them run their course.  I do tend to cure parasites, etc sooner rather than later.
---
That aside, good doggy and many cans of dog food in inventory, so I dont loot most critter meat, but if i do, I’ll eat most anything raw.
---
Thank you. Just... thank you. I alrwady fished out the uniform a few months ago. Now, it is time to get the helmet.
---
Ooh I see what you’re saying! The water meter! That’s weird... I just fast traveled there, Wonder how my water meter was empty already? 
---
(Usually it doesn’t let me fast travel with that empty...)
---
Giving satisfaction to idiots with hacked weapons and big egos.
---
If it had the night vision effect that would be cool. Or rather the spotting scopes light adjustment. NV is garbage in this game.
---
Maybe also worth noting, that you don’t need repair kits to repair gear. Just go to the appropriate workbench.
---
It collects, steel, concrete, cork, cloth, glass, wood and leather.
---
So you're saying Bethesda would bring back atom challenges for 1 week and then take them away again?
---
They aren't common.  Just because there are more doesn't mean they're super common.  I am a casual player.
---
TIL I learned that the atom shop refreshes at 10:30 am, and not 11:00 am with the daily timer.
---
It should yes but apparently it doesn’t some weapons were hit harder some build were hit perceivably harder than others like while my .50 cal is still useable someone who is a riflemen build has to switch to commando if they want to do good dmg
---
I'd rather just have it so people would stop complaining and see how not bad it is.
---
the AP legendary stacks. whether the diminishing returns are worth it is up to you.
---
do you have 15 agility as well? if you're not worried about literally maxing it, then level 1 action boy might be enough.
---
I think I got them from the BoS vendor in Goodsprings.
---
It'll take me longer than that. I have a wife, three dogs, and a full time job. . . Lol. I still haven't finished the Wastelanders storyline yet. I haven't broken into the vault. I get to play every so often and when I do it's to get these damn daily or weekly tasks done. . .
---
RNGesus, hallowed be thy drops. Thy 3*'s come, thy will be dumb, in Mama Murghs as it is in events. Give us this day our shitty rolls, in ACP as it is with SBQ. And give us not rng passes, as you give not our enemies drops. For thine is the worst, the cruelest, and the most stingy. Ramen.
---
Well I couldn’t try it on the ss because it says if I do anything it will get rid of the jet pack but the solar can only have one thing done to it it
---
What happened? glitch?
---
I died as I was leaving ACP and lost all my junk. Maybe because the wendigos got me after Earl died? At least I got to keep the Legendary I got off his corpse.
---
Are you using the same damage multipliers though?  Also anything multiplied by a big number is bigger than something multiplied by a small number.  It's worse for big numbers.  That's math.
---
We are seeing how bad it is that’s why people are talking about how bad it is. They don’t have enough time (unless they delay it) to get any more changes in there’s not a lot of days till the pts closes and they can’t get feed back from the content they put in if it’s closed
---
Right-but duped holiday items destroyed (are still destroying) the caps market. I feel as if once something is used as a currency in this game, it is hyper-inflated (through an exploit or other means) and made essentially worthless in the wider market. This forces us into a trade-only market, which we both know can be unfriendly to new/first-time players (who don’t have the resources to fork over 75k in trade value for a good gun.
---
Wouldn’t Bethesda want new as well as veteran players to continue playing? Devaluing yet another of our currencies just to make more bullets/for the hell of it will only make the situation more difficult for newer players.  I’d imagine it’s great to have the ability to instantly replenish your caps by opening certain items (holiday items) or have 6 figures of a certain type of ammo-but down the road all of these will have zero/no trade value. I think players were just fine before the ammo factory glitch was blitzed into oblivion-that didn’t stop players from playing.
---
Can I remove the Buttressed and replace it with Asbestos for ACP? Would that destroy the jetpack mod so that I would have to rebuild it again? Also , do you know if I apply camo paint to SS armor will I be able to attach more features like stealth to the arms or limbs? Like in the case for T-65?
---
To be completely fair, reading their wording on that left some room for interpretation. Remember when some people though that Season 2 would have a cost, because there was some ‘wiggle room’ in the way it was worded?
---
I’d have to go find their exact wording on the Daily/Weekly Challenge to be sure. The current Season 2 FAQ doesn’t address it directly.  It says ’Daily &amp; Weekly Challenges no longer award Atoms in the new system’, bud does that mean while under the season system only or completely overall?
---
While I personally believe there won’t be any Atom rewards during that ‘off week’, I honesty don’t know what will happen. Will we have challenges at all?
---
*Then* if you can find the body.
---
Lol, I wouldn't call dropping a bag of poop a crusade.
---
he was mocking me hard after a long discussion.
---
I don’t usually do pvp, but when I get gun bashed for over 15 minutes, enough is enough, I ain’t got no magic or hacked weapons, I usually use Gauss mini, and that sucks for pvp.
---
Your name doesn’t happen to have Shank in it does it?
---
Yes but those big multipliers should still be big but they aren’t what Bethesda’s doing is taking good high dmg weapons and making them useless
---
&gt;  who bother other players by attempting pvp, yet have pacifist enabled
---
Sounds like there is a funny story behind this.
---
He was on purpose trying to trigger me. It wasnt that he asked about zombies, it was the endless on purpose triggering discussion, and I didnt make a problem out of it, I just blocked him same as I will block you.
---
Possibility considering they both nuked eachother.
---
fallout runs on Eastern Standard Time, if you ever forget you can just google "Bethesda Time" because bethesda, md is EST
---
I’ve been using herbivore mutation and corn soup.  AP regen. No action boy.
---
Not useless, just weaker.
---
As someone who has been using the internet on a daily basis for over 30 years, I've become quite adept at dismissing the majority of what people "think".
---
Yea agility is like 19 I think. I was reading through some of the older posts about it and some said it keeps stacking and others said it’s not worth it after a certain point. So basically it does keep stacking whether or not it’s as high as I want it it’s up to me.
---
My red pin. Took ages to find one, and then I found two. Gave the other one to another party member.
---
We'll just have to see.
---
That's understandable then.  Usually if someone is being a douche, I'll shoot in their general direction a few times, but 15 minutes sounds like you've run into people with salt problems.
---
IIRC Asbestos and Jet Pack use the same mod-slot. Better craft another chest, might be cheaper.
---
Oh they’ll see alright I’ve already seen a increase in posts about how the Ltd changes are bad in their current state and it need to be changed
---
I'm not taking a huge moral stance here. I'm just having fun with more egregious exploiters.
---
The queen.. you accidentally shoot someone when the adds spawn at the end. Then they kill you take your flux. Not worth losing flux. Additionally, most people are here for the PvE aspect. So like myself turn it off and ignore people.
---
Yeah same here I get a lot of that too, the same lvl 300 guys I've always played with always end up in the same server as me
---
Ramen brother!
---
&gt;and now there's a flock of seagulls in my room.    
---
That's when you ran, you ran so far away. And you ran, you ran all night and day. Couldn't get away.
---
Jetpack in normal armor shouldn’t be a thing in the first place so why are you complaining
---
A question for your question since I don’t have solar or thorn: are you talking about only being able to put a strengthening/durability mod on it like polymer, or only being able to put a mod mod on it like asbestos or deep pocket? The reason I ask is because my friend runs around in thorn armor and he has polymer and deep pockets on his using the scout mods bought in whitespring bunker.
---
What if something like this happens..[teehee](https://youtu.be/z2UYDRfUvq4)
---
If a riflemen build is weaker to the point where it does the same dmg as a commando build then the riflemen build is useless
---
Yea I’m a carnivore. I do this on my alts tho. I just wasn’t sure what the max regen would be and if it’s even worth it to kee trying to roll leg armor pieces with ap regen once it gets under a few seconds anyway.
---
Unless you played relentlessly, you weren't given the chance to complete this season, despite the half assed effort to fix that half way through. Also most of the rewards were not worth the daily grind.
---
I've had the best luck with Phoenix in Watoga and Wallace in Harper's Ferry having the plans. You might need to server hop a couple of times but I usually have good luck getting less common inventories with these 2 bot vendors. Grahm is also an option, but harder to find unless it's Meat Week.
---
pretty much. angryturtle tested AP pieces. a single one cuts the time it takes to refill the bar by half, a second piece by 3 seconds, a third by 2 seconds, etc.
---
Man every time I travel to white springs station, I be scripting weapons, then some guy is bashing me in the back of the head, I’m like ok, maybe I’m taking too long at the machine, so I move away and let them use the machine thinking maybe they are in a rush, nope it’s sledgehammer to the face. So I’m like ok I’ll travel somewhere else, the idiot follows me so I attempt to kill them yet when I shoot they have their pacifist on.
---
I've had this happen on Xbox where the loading symbol for it was loading endlessly and white out so i had to close the game and reset my net and it ended up working again the next time I got on :/
---
I just want a raider or camo painted LMG and some Gatling laser/plasma skins
---
Also the .45 smg and the pipe weapons.
---
They did what? Who makes decissions there? You just saved some asses and thats how they thank you? ; o Imagine banking sector operating like that : o
---
People affected by caffeine XD
---
I get why we probably don’t have them. (Trap camps) Going forward ive been putting my camp down and before I do any building I move the camp around for my desired spawn in location then I build.
---
Oh man, I would but I haven't seen any for sale in player vendors. I've done the event 20+ times and still no helmet.
---
Yea Idk how I missed that video. I watch a lot of his shit. I’ll go find that now just to see it in action. Thanks for reply
---
For real, I’m like damn dude, u ain’t worn out yet, seems like I have to jump servers just to be left alone.
---
Has anyone been able to get it? I've tried every explosive weapon I have and it didn't come out of the case :(
---
The .45 deserves the Silver Shroud skin. I'm surprised we have the outfit but not the skin
---
Agree. Since there are already PA skins that can be applied to any kind of PA, weapons should be next step.
---
Literally was on the main menu after hopping off a private server and realized I had like $300 worth of atoms. I hoped over to the atom shop to try to buy something to see if it immediately reverted back to my actual amount but it didn't. It actually jumped up higher. Then I switch to the Microsoft shop where you can purchase atoms to see exactly how much money I had on my account. When I switched back to fo76 it jumped up again. Anytime I switched screens while fo76 was on it would jump to a even higher number. Then I guess the game couldn't handle it after I started playing a character because the number it's at now is crazy High.
---
If we didn’t have the RNG, what would keep players combing back and playing?
---
You're right. But the point is it shouldn't be a 3* cuz it's never going to drop a 3* item
---
No I personally don’t think that should be the case considering 3*s are extremely easy to farm
---
Hopefully you won't see the bill on your credit card.
---
Yup, I didn't have to report shit. But they wipe my atoms revoke my FO1st and now I cant access the atom ahop or legendary run. What a shit show.
---
You reset your WiFi. I've hard restarted and quit out of the game 50 times now. Maybe I'll try wifi next
---
You want a regular pipe wrench?
---
that is true, i guess the seasons stuff isn't very fallout focused but more consumer?
---
Damn. I would just put a ticket in in and not mess with it too much.  Do you know how many atoms you actually had to start with? Either way I wouldn't buy anything
---
Can drop fixers they are just in a seperated drop pool that has a wayyy lower chance of dropping
---
*Gee, thanks.*
---
I presented a reasoned and rational point, allowing for the possibility of either side, and even though my personal guess seems to align with yours, the entire post is dismissed. 
---
No worries, man. I was just trying to have a polite conversation.
---
Have a good day.
---
I always carry around a suit of PA just in case I need to jump from the top of the monorail elevator. No need for perks, armor slots. Only 10 pounds less in the backpack. And it's useful for those Lead farming sessions and those occasions where you need 425 carry weight.
---
I've seen this happen before. If I login and notice a bunch of players there, half the time it's this scenario you describe. I don't get it. I do that event every time it shows up, and usually as soon as I can get there when it pops up. My last two solo runs have *almost* been successful with keeping my bear alive; if they just wouldn't charge the alpha - 'WTF bear, you're supposed to be high, relax!"
---
Ran it last night, with Habitat-A; all the way through, I'm noticing, 'Where are all of the YaoGuai that usually are lurking around waiting to charge me?" Well, they all apparently spawned in when the alpha squatch spawned in and took that opportunity to charge me, killing the bear, and failing the event. 
---
At least I got a 2* Assassins Pole Hook for expending all of that ammo and time./s
---
Clandestine skin would fit it well too!
---
Speed demon should make it swing faster imo
---
I didn't know that! I haven't had a punch bowl out since the HoA and trying, not hard, to get Captain Weird to drink a nukashine mid-eval. 😭😭
---
There's a setting, I think in gameplay, where you can turn off names. You might have accidentally did this, or it happened on it's own. I once had this issue.
---
Check under the settings.
---
Lmao! Oooo look out we got a badass here!😆
---
I‘d take that for 7,600 hrs
---
Similar scene but I was helping out a new player on my lowbie alt with the Ammo factory. We got the takeover but ran out of ammo for the defend, go figure. And... a level 80 scorchbeast shows up for a midday snack.  I set the Ammo machine to .308 for the sniper rifle I had, he was melee and had never fought a SB before.  I ran up to the roof dodging blasts and stimpacking as much as possible and placed turrets under the over hangs on the roof. I managed to get one that the SB couldnt it didn’t hit at all and for the next 20 mins sniped and cat and moused it around the turrets as much as possible and wore it down. Eventually our strategy worked and we got it down thanks mostly to the well placed turret. The other guy was so ecstatic we fix it and we got pics! I then logged on my main and came and dropped him a bunch of goodies. Frabjous day! Caloo! Callay! !
---
From what I can tell, the community managers seem to be so good people. I feel bad for them, they deserve none of the blame.
---
legendary coins as a rank/challenge/event reward would be great
---
HAHAHAHA, then I guess China players should be restricted to claim Power Armor skins
---
If it does I'll call the bank. Wouldn't care at all if Bethesda just removed all the crap I just got from the atom shop tbh. I already buy whatever I want from there so they're making money from me already
---
agreed
---
It's the same thing in the complete other direction, too.  I'm a healer/tank build, I spend most of my time helping people, partying to share empath and team medic, and handing out cranberry relish at the start of events.  Afterwards there's always a few entitled people following me around hoping for free shit and getting upset when I won't give them a god weapon or something.  Like dude it's fucking cranberry relish I'm being nice, not running a charity.
---
i gotta try that on a dragon LOL
---
They did they made 3* way easier to get it used to be Almost impossible to get it way back in the good ole days then I think around somewhere between wild Appalachia and a few months after they made it so you usually at least get a 2* sometimes
---
Thanks,  I have been delaying the rolls to upgrade the current chest piece but I guess it is time to use those legendary modules that I bought from Mmmrrgh.👍😁
---
Yeah I think I only had like 1900 so huge difference lol
---
Probably said it because of this
---
https://imgur.com/a/84T3Z0i
---
in the future? i was hoping for some free ones for rank rewards :/
---
  Modding existing armor can have a major effect on its capabilities, and shielded Underarmor can give you a nice bump, plus some special boosts, too.
---
IIRC, one of the BoS Underarmors, shielded, gives you something like +13dr, +9 ER, and a bump to 2 different specials.
---
Before I started using SS armor:
---
  I ended up with a majority heavy metal.  Relative to mods, the chest piece started life at something like 76 DR, but after a couple of mods, was up at 117, limbs started at 35ish, but modded up to about 45,
---
  But heavy metal isn’t balanced - it has very high DR, but not much ER/RR, so still needed to change to PA in some areas of the map.   (Low RR not that great when your high capacity backpack has a negative effect on RR, and you are fighting ghouls.)
---
  You may also find a mixture of different types may suit your needs, or provide “best overall” until you roll a full set with the characteristics you want, as it is  almost guaranteed you will not roll a 3\* Vanguard Chest with AP regen and Weapon Weight reduction on your first try :)
---
Yeah I’m trying to play this game with challenging. I don’t use any weapon and just use my fist without any perk card in adventure. I find it very challenging and fun.
---
I spend like 40 bullets on Earle guess I’m doing something wrong
---
Thanks, will look into this in settings!
---
What about the Space Explorer Jangles Backpack? Matched with the astronaut outfit :)
---
Or the Giant Sheepsquatch Plushie?
---
Screws just play ACP
---
You were just a splash in the floor, but you didn't die, this is your evolved form.
---
Haha yeah I keep all my armour or weapons that maybes one day I might use . All jjst fill up my mules
---
I love the simplicity of them. If we can modify weapons, repaint them and repair them why not have restored and shiny weapons too
---
Thanks for the update!  I'm not a big PvP fan, but the idea of a server-wide race to become president seemed very cool.  It's a shame they couldn't figure out a way to make it happen.
---
I didn’t see him as trying to trigger you. Maybe it’s a cultural difference, but his posts were (to me) just direct and clear.  I’ve seen far worse antagonistic comments here, including the one where the guy talked about you being in diapers. 
---
Compared to that?  Miller was exceptionally civil. I hope you blocked diaper guy as well. 
---
As far as blocking me?  Go for it. Won’t bother me in the slightest.  Miller shares a lot of useful information, as do I (if I say so myself).  If you can’t handle such a simple inquiry, asking for you to clarify what you mean, then that’s a you issue.
---
Have a good day, bud.
---
Me too. I start using my combat knife without perk cards and it’s very challenging
---
I have the same issue. I have purchased Fallout first trough steam 2 hr ago.
---
The payment went through steam, but I don't have the Fallout1st in-game. ON steam it shows F1 added to the library.  I've raised a ticket on Bethesda support, but it's pathetic that still can't deal with the transactions properly. :(
---
I've been able to manage my stash better as of late, if I made the cuts that I could have so long ago I would have had some nice armor sets :(
---
Good luck man!
---
I don’t worry about them until I get the notification that I cannot pick up any more. Then I drop the stack
---
Yea all those lvl ups that could’ve went to perk cards,  then to perk card points , instead of special points put u way behind. It’s kinda wack that they do it that way.
---
Ok, this story is wholesome at some point. But yea, if it wasnt for my power armor (t45 right leg and left arm, t51 helmet, and the rest t60) And my trusty legendary double barrel shotgun, i would have just run away. Where you placed the turrets? I want to know because i got the feeling the game is gonna send me SB from now on.
---
Maybe player are exactly their names.
---
I love this idea... Does anybody remember the Baby Deathclaw Commander mod for New Vegas? (Really old mod, it’s where Alchestbreach got Mr Cuddlesworth.)
---
Basically you hatch a Deathclaw egg and every time you fed it the Deathclaw would grow bigger. Eventually it would even eat a stealth boy and have the ability to become invisible.
---
What if we tamed pets, then once they’re back at your camp you have the option to feed then. (Rara has an excellent example of what this menu would be like in Fun and Games, she asks you for food and opens your aid section where you can pick a food item to give.) Feed your pet enough and they go up a tier. Say you feed your level 21 pet Deathclaw enough cooked meat, it’ll level up to the next tier, maybe change looks. Eventually when it reaches level 100 it’ll turn into a glowing Deathclaw.
---
( u/LoneVaultWanderer Neat idea eh? My last two pet deathclaws, pet opossum, and pet Yao Guai all died to my own turrets... So being able to level up your pet would be awesome.)
---
Repair kits and the Weapon Artisan perk are key to resource management. I do not mind at all quick swapping in my level 3 WA perk so the condition on weapons gets doubled.
---
Someone once suggest a location in world that was a model home displaying new atom shop items. That would be absolutely amazing.
---
No. There are two slots on armor. 
---
- Resistance Increase
---
- Functionality Change
---
Jet pack is a functionality change, just like Asbestos. There may be some minor crossover (like a little extra stealth from the Shadowed option on Leather), but each of the two mod slots has a primary purpose. And every mod is designated for one slot or the other. Not both.
---
Paint is the third ‘mod’, and recently started becoming available for all the armors. It’s simply an aesthetic mod, no functional difference (except not showing up in trade windows, which is nice).
---
LMFAO, Also the dudes that be acting a fool then, offering trade I’m like what could you possibly want, I’m trying to do everyone a favor and script a nocturnal lead pipe.
---
Nah... all of them on different teams??😀🐴
---
Lmao.just wanted to help...Help himself! Lol shits crazy I swear we cant make this shhht up fast enough
---
Nah, all they have to do is put a no-build zone on that whole front road of Fort Defiance.
---
Lol for real just got the game with my brother and we stopped playing instantly after realizing it's not actually CO OP.
---
If we have to beat half of every mission by ourselves there's literally no point in playing together.
---
They should've just made Fallout 5 instead of this garbage the dam Netcode doesn't even work enemies die like 1-2 seconds after i kill them and get XP their head explodes XD.
---
35 minutes right, and I had no idea we would get a BOS collection, nice!
---
wish i was there to help, im a junkie heavy build lv.222 with gauss miniguns, final word, anti gatling gun, and 3 2 shot cryolators and tons of ammo and could definitely help kill her 😣
---
I’ve come across some of those boxes, the ones you have to pick the lock on. And I’ve never become wanted for doing it. Not even the little crates that have the nuke keycards in them.
---
Oh yeah, that too. At least we will be able to scrap those excess cards when legendary perks come out
---
I'm an even truer patriot. I'll claim them and make sure they never see the light of day, left to rot in the crafting menus forever.
---
AT&amp;T girl=Milky Milky
---
I feel your presence would have been very appreciated!! - maybe next time I’ll witness all that in action 😁
---
Right, I might have let him launch, but when he come falling through the roof in the control room I’m like yeah this dude can go kick rocks.
---
It has a decent drop rate via Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets. The version “with chaps” is a little rarer I believe...
---
Unfortunately, the level 15 guarding the conveyor belt must not be left without supervision lol
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
I threw them in my vendor for 5 caps and people buy them for some reason, free supplies, I guess.
---
Shh I'm with a data mining group there's alot more
---
obsessive communist disorder wont get me i can leave a few claim slots blinkin 😅
---
Hell, even 200 is too much. You can get it now from turning in Pleasant Valley tickets that you occasionally get off ghouls and scorched.
---
I think it's one of the things they've do e an excellent job with,  if not a little too on the nose lately.  BOS would have been more exciting if they had trickled the files instead of dumping to be decoded all at once
---
Saying that a community manager just posted an explination on this thread, theyve explained the issue thankfully
---
This, cause you never know
---
Damn I didt even know about that I just stared playing again recently
---
There’s legacy armor now?  Am I misreading you?  (Have been on break since i completed the season).
---
It’s a lot more accessible now due to the Pleasant Valley Claim tickets. The one with the chaps is slightly more rare, but not by much. I think I get about 1 chaps version for every four standard ones.
---
I’m looking forward to it, I don’t mind the grind.
---
I have a ssd, it's not the newest but it is a ssd
---
"Some" it's like half of every quest dude.
---
Seems like I'm playing Fallout 4 but with all the enemies having horrible AI and their bodies not physically reacting to me killing them untill 1-2 seconds after they die and i get XP.
---
This game feels more like a solo game to me i bought the game to play with my brother and we had to stop playing because it felt like we weren't doing anything together but getting outside loot on the ground.
---
I'm guessing it opens up eventually but most of the missions are inside mines and buildings witch we have to do solo.
---
They should've just done both ways and they NEED fix the AI and netcode it's unplayable ATM for me (PS4)
---
I was more on the "does not cause enough damage to enemies" bit - sorry
---
Gamma has better DPS than most realize.
---
I would save a month or 2 worth of script to pick my legendary. You know how OP this would be?
---
This is ur answer. You need to know which mods go in which spot. What are you trying to put on them?
---
Nope, I just mean people have gotten rid of unyielding armor because they were a full health build, like what I did. Now I'm climbing up to get unyielding armor again
---
I know right!
---
Huge mommy milkers
---
I think there should be differences. Having all the weapons working the same way is boring. But if a weapon lacks in one area, it should excel in others. For instance, lasers would be balanced with the current low damage if they had no recoil at all and were totally precise. Because I don't suffer any recoil when turning on my torch, and because laser pointers have absolute precision. It would make sense and be balanced too.
---
Well, I was only asking because yesterday I couldn't apply the Stealth Boy functionality on my T-65 torso until I painted it with the Camo paint from the Atomic Shop. I already had the jetpack on the torso. Having the camo paint somehow helped to put the jetpack on the arm and and then apply the Stealth Boy on the  torso. I am getting confused about it why it works but as long if it works I am happy.😀🤓
---
Still learning the features of this game at level 260, I apologize.😀
---
Sometimes theres loot sometimes there isn't AFAIK, I usually roll this with my friend on private server, sometimes there is just no loot for both of us
---
I was a public team leader too, so there is a blue icon over my name, he fast traveled to Charlie by spending caps, seeing a player inside already, power armor glitched inside, then proceeded to race me to the key card terminal. Talking about he was just trying to help, come on man, we all know his intentions.
---
Lately I’ve been just sitting on the roof as the event goes. Good time for me to check my emails.
---
Ban for what their bad coding?
---
Does posting this same comment over and over again make you feel clever?
---
You guys are awesome, used the ps4 one and was amazed that there were still some plans i did know after all these hours playing!
---
it's only gonna hit home when Bethesda fixes magic weapons. I'm guessing the majority of people don't realize how sponge-y Earle is because every instance has one mr. big dickus swinging around his magic LMG.
---
A streamer was walking around asking a friend of mine for super rare items last night, asking if he'd hook up him, etc. Super cringe.
---
I just figured people were preparing for the patch 22 damage nerf and the bullet sponges that everything in the wasteland will become.
---
I failed it once cause it got stuck in the ceiling and we timed out, but no other than that we've succeeded every time. Could just be luck cause I have only done about 10 runs so far, but people seem to be managing just fine. I recommend clearing the adds the instance they spawn. You could be losing out on a lot of dps because of people dying to the wendigos, or running away from them, instead of fighting the boss.
---
Have you actually played in PTS and tested the changes? And witnessed how little the damage calculation change actually affects you? No. No you haven't.
---
It’s efforts like this from members of the community that remind me of how helpful it can be. 
---
Well done!  It’s appreciated!
---
I'm sorry for your bad OP
---
Thanks to that last dupe wave I dont even bother with the purveyor. Just modules.anything I get from her cant top what's in my stash.lol it did take a big part of the grind out for me
---
The past couple of times I've (level 271) done FTP, it's been to help a new player out who was soloing the event. Next thing I know, about five 100+ players show up as well, and needless to say the event is completed spotlessly.
---
actually if the data mines for this month's atom shop items are correct and hopefully we will be getting mannequins to display our outfits and armor, as well as power armor stands 😊
---
Are... are you serious? I’ve been risking life and limb mining in a collapsing mineshaft and I could just stay outside and pretend to be the manager, thus saving my ammo and durability?
---
Western w/o Chaps, should sell 50 caps maybe. Western w Chaps, 100 caps. Get from Pleasant Valley Claim ticket rewards
---
You don’t know the spot then.  They spawn right next to you all inside of each other.
---
Nice.  I haven’t played that since about a year after launch.
---
I'm on Xbox, I'm only rocking 3 pieces of unyielding and having no problems staying in stealth.
---
It’s a simple acknowledgement. It’s designed to be taken however the OP chooses. 
---
I used to make semi-snarky or sarcastic comments to complaint posts like this. I decided to curb that behavior and go for a more neutral response.
---
Also, welcome to the subreddit.
---
I'm fine with it. Raiders are out there, watch yourself.
---
I mean if you haven't tried it yet give it a go, and if you have tried it and know you can do it with a few friends or reliable team or you can solo or whatever then go for it. Just in my experience since I don't have the power of a demigod I can't solo him and I need a few decent teammates with me. Most randoms will end up wasting your time in my experience.
---
I had this problem recently, funnily enough only with charlie, none of the furniture loaded in.
---
It did right itself after a few server hops though so keep trying
---
I thought it did. I have been running around in one for months and have never got damage/diseases from not wearing a gas mask.
---
Nice.  I’ll have to look into Scorched Earth.  I’m only level 23 so a lot of areas are out of reach at the moment.
---
I just don't get it.  People complain the rng is too hard, now it's too easy.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
For a second I was scared it was my precious ultra rare fire man set but it’s just the fire breather set so that’s fine by me
---
Mules are life.
---
Fair enough. Outside of some bugs (like, there is a way to add jet packs to PA limbs??), this is how it’s supposed to work.
---
Plasma flamer is fun if against multiple enemies coming at you.
---
I’ll photmode glitcth into in after I eat breakfast and let ya know
---
Thanks that’s good to know.  TV diner trays are also solid and apparently alarm clocks give aluminum.  I know in FO4 I grabbed every globe possible for screws.
---
I'm back to report that it does indeed work. The outfit moved so that enough of it was thru the glass and I could grab it. The hat I grabbed before tossing the grenade, but I was able to grab it successfully.
---
  On a down side, all the books in the room and in the hallway are thrown all over the floor. I don't think overseer will be very happy when she goes up there later
---
And *that’s* your weekly homework assignment from Bethesda, folks.
---
The 180 world items/60 world containers is a myth. Angry Turtle tested this already. There's only one list of recent interactions which is maximum 255 items - including containers/world items.
---
[https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0?t=1070](https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0?t=1070)
---
Oooo, kill em' !!
---
Try a server jump. Sometimes it bugs out completely.
---
You let noobs touch your stuff? That's how you get a disease bro
---
That’s why my melee main uses combat knives. I know it’s not as efficient as punching or a super sledge but rapid fire stabbing things in melee is hilarious.
---
I try to go to that one whenever it pops. It used to award Canned Stew to the whole server, which felt appropriate to the name/theme of the event.
---
This has been the case for all events for several months now.
---
Yeah, played on about 12 servers now and still happening :(
---
I thought lucky shades were only in NV. Now I feel dumb lol
---
....sorry my big dickus is a penta gauss TS FFR. I do wait 30 seconds before I shoot him so everyone can loot him though. Also what is wrong with killing him in a minute? Means there is always 3 ACP on the server I'm in. People race to do the silos if I am around.   
---
Also magic weapons was the fix to rubberbanding they have been around since BETA it has just been a floating they fix 1 and boom 2-4 other types pop up to the point where it is on 8 now.... I don't think they can "fix" them without undoing a lot of minor bandaids they put on and breaking the game.
---
Do you mean as in a full 3D mode, or just know what’s coming up ahead of time in general?
---
Not really. Pipe 38 is slightly worse than 10mm because it has a longer reload time. I compared the semi-automatic versions of both pistols and they have the same 18-shot reload time. However, 38 pipe has a high rate of fire, which means that it is precisely the reloading that suffers.
---
I use both pistols, 38 pipe is better for weak opponents, and 10mm is better for those who are thicker.
---
like just to know whats next
---
All I have to say is oof ;-;
---
Having same issue on Xbox
---
I'm personally upset that they are not giving Fallout 1st members more camp budget.  The idea of paying for a service is to get better content in game.  They need to fix the camp budget immediately.
---
The Inside The Vault articles usually do that. Let me see if I can find the link, I believe I have it saved.
---
no, I would rather nuke camps
---
You have to complete her other questline first. I cant remember what its called but its the one that you are doing her chores for her. the missing link maybe?
---
I dont mind trading with them but I do mind them requesting my end-game gear
---
That is interesting. I’m not holding a super excessive amount but I’ve found aluminum to be easy to come across. Lead and acid are the things that I’m always hunting for.
---
Caps are meaningless to endgame players anyways.
---
I cannot agree that both weapons have comparable damage. You've probably compared an automatic carbine and a semi-automatic pistol - in this case, the carbine will be slightly better - but if you compare the real DPS, the pistol suffers a lot.
---
I will later add lever-action rifles and revolvers to the comparison. But I guarantee carbines are VERY superior to pistols.
---
Pipe pistol in hand, best intention in heart but a frail body that can get killed by a molerat. Poor low level
---
Raising the overall cap doesn't really do anything unless they raise the daily cap at the same time.
---
If you have everything you want then why do you even care about script?
---
Or for spending currency you know you don’t really have. If it were actual currency that’d be fraud. So a ban on taking advantage of it would hardly be out of line.
---
Then there are at least 2 spots.
---
Yeah, I gotta agree. The original plan of one month between seasons felt far more reasonable. I’m guessing that they saw how much it bumped player numbers up, and not having much else to put out in the interim just decided to go almost immediately into season 2. 
---
Personally, I think it’s going to burn people out. But FO76’s player base has put up with a lot already, so I could easily be wrong.
---
There’s only 1 good one.
---
Just buy legendary modules.  That way you will be stocked up when new weapons and armor release
---
Yes-but I’m thinking about new players here. End-game players can afford those high value trades.
---
*your the dumbass.
---
(Which makes that note even better I need to start farming it.)
---
If I don’t want it or don’t need it I recycle it. Not a Big F for me, but an A+ that I can do that. 
---
I still regularly scrap explosive weapons, handmades, and fixers. Why? Because I don’t use them and don’t care about trading them.
---
Not to mention having millions of holiday gifts in circulation accelerated that process.
---
They are, and I feel dumb that I didnt get them, even though I tried.
---
Sorry I don't have time to walk everywhere I go in game if I actually want to get anything done lmao.
---
Hmmm...i was just gonna buy a month of 1st for ps4 today. Is this a pc only thing of disabling new 1st members or all platforms?
---
Because it's a reward from some dailies. Same as caps and T notes, which both have a much higher limit. Should Op stop doing dailies???
---
Terribly low chance
---
Haha, very true. Yeh you know it mate, Angry Turtle. 🐢👍
---
Sell cap needs to be 1,000! Half my stash is weapon &amp; armor waiting to script out
---
My guess you or someone else was spamming tesla rifle?
---
No. Pacifying will not make the animal follow you home. You need to find a random spawn of "scene" type encounters. If you are lucky, you may find a tameable animal. The difference is that it has an option to tame it when you walk up to it or aim at it with a weapon that isnt using a scope. I've never managed to find a tameable cat yet though they do exist.
---
\*EDIT\* Forgot the [link](https://i.imgur.com/JxLe1Qp.jpg) to scene type encounter locations.
---
I'm on PC :/
---
Hmm let me think, I can have an effect that barely boosts my weapon above a work bench crafted weapon,  or I can have practical immortality. Hmmm choice right there....
---
Almost certain it’ll be a canned animation that plays when you interact with it. Will probably grant some kind of temporary buff if you’re lucky.
---
I have nothing against magic weapons, personally. except for the fact that I can't use them. what I meant is that, initially, people won't feel the effects of the nerf as much because magic weapons will probably still be around. the nerf means nothing when you can melt the queen in 3 seconds.
---
but neither TS nor 25 are magic effects, though.
---
Nope...but if the OP has everything they want/need... what difference does it make if they go poof because they are at 1,000? That is what I am asking?
---
PS: I have almost 5,000 bullion and 500 treasury notes. I do not like most of the things we can buy with them and finished the legendary run, so I have the cosmetics that they will add In season 2...so when I reach 5,000 gold I will not stop playing, not will I complain...since I already have what I want.
---
That would be nice however, then everyone would see the bugged items and not buy them.
---
Suits me. Get to see what’s actually worth grinding for!
---
Can it not be based off where you're fast travelling from? Like if you fast travel from west side of the map to your base it would be different than if you fast travel from east side of the map to your base, north, south, etc. 
---
My base has about 3 consistent spawns (as well as some rarer ones) and all three are not near each other at all. Or maybe it changes spawns if the area is already loaded before you fast travel to your base? 
---
There is a LOT of inconsistencies with spawn locations. I recently deleted one of my two mag racks and now I spawn INSIDE of the mag rack, whereas before I spawned a few steps in front of both.
---
Edit: you're right about them being north of the camp placement. Well for me mostly east but still north. Northeast. All spawns were different altitudes and distance from camp though. ~.~
---
I had this happen the other day on a new alt. Server hopping didn’t fix it, but closing then restarting the game did.
---
Good doggy, and cola nut. My guy eats dog food and soda, ONLY
---
Hope it gets sorted out.
---
Well there was someone a Tesla but he didn't last long when he fired it.. but can that really affect it? I did use several different kinds of Grenades like the Floaters freezing one but I don't know though, I don't think anyone else was suffering from it or not.
---
I'm madr myself my made rolled secret service unyielding +1P Acrobat for each leg. Cant move them to my bloodied toon. So made.
---
Oh okay, carry on!
---
Thanks. New to marketplace.
---
The ash piles from energy weapons are causing the frame drops.
---
We’ll see, if it’s true then the prices of clothing is about to go through the roof lol
---
Had this earlier on a Berserkers build with 15 AGL and all the stealth perk cards.
---
PS4. Im not gonna be on til later today
---
I assume you tame an animal via the Perk... But how do you get it back to your camp and then to stay in/around your camp?
---
Yes it matters. Easiest way to test, try it yourself with two different weapons.
---
Omw 😁
---
Lumpymoose saves the day again!
---
Bloodied Faster 40% Swing Speed 1 strength cultist dagger, fast swing speed already adding 40% faster swing speed, add martial artist for an additional 30% faster swing speed, now making it 70% faster swing speed, 30% faster swing speed from a reworked speed demon, making it 100% faster swing speed on an already fast weapon. Idk, I think that might be too broken. Lol
---
Idk of you have ever used a dagger/knife with faster swing speed and martial artist, but that is already ridiculous, fun, but ridiculous. Would suggest to anyone who just wants a fun playstyle, or a laugh.
---
I cant wait to display the Commie power armor when we get mannequins!
---
Also my Commie Collectron is the best.
---
I think so. If you're perched outside the whitespring clubhouse and you fire an unsupressed weapon, you will find yourself neck deep in ghouls.
---
Okay! 😃
---
I didn't know that, thanks for telling me! I'll keep that in mind.
---
lesson learned, if a bug happens to you, do not report it ...
---
Upvote for Ramen!
---
Is there a legacy list on this page? I wouldn’t know one if it bit me. Lol
---
Yes, I know the grammar isn't the same as on the note but I couldn't bring myself to type it that way.
---
Now I want a Noodle Cup.
---
2 questions 1. Are you sure you still had time on the effects? 2. Did you test your XP gain to see if it's a visual bug?
---
Love that GT btw
---
Thank you very much
---
You guys are awesome.
---
Nobody uses them because they're [actually broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/f48ljr/energy_weapons_are_still_broken_this_really_needs/)
---
More than likely these will be featured for purchase. Not given away for free, Todd needs those Bethesda bucks
---
Without suppressor you will only benefit from sneak attack bonus on your first shot, with suppressor every shot will be one as long as you remain hidden. And the difference is huge.
---
That's exactly why it would be amazing.
---
I scrapped my pristine one, people keep leaving it open.
---
Everyone liked that.
---
I've gotten to the point where I blaspheme RNGesus more than I pray.
---
I honestly would like to have all the unstoppable costumes displayed by my vendors just to look really cool x3
---
the ammo converter in 76 is ridiculous. They should do something similar to Fallout 4 Horizon mod where you use ammo as a resource to craft components used in ammo crafting. Keep this stuff as a workbench so it can access your stash. Honestly trash this whole terminal idea.
---
One of my friends has a trick for FTP, whenever I'm guarding the upper level he'll drop a PA chassis to block the front doorway, which makes the ghouls come up the stairs outside to my area, usually we end up with a pile of bodies upstairs. I'm ok with him doing it, always seem to find a few Pleasant Valley claim tickets, which are a nice bonus
---
Yes for us, but not for Bethesda.
---
It travels there automagically on it's own. The problem is when they get there they normally don't last too long. Some npc or troll pc inevitably comes around and puts them down.
---
It may need some time to register you have it
---
You have to go into twice and with the slight lag of the menu opening I can understand that. I do it out of habit but it's still annoying to wait lol
---
Edit: I forgot that's not how it works at another's camp lol
---
My allies do that. They also leave every fucking door open in my house it's infuriating. 
---
DID THEY NOT HAVE DOORS IN SPACE?!
---
Weird 🤔 but I throw about 10-20 for 500 each and they sell out like hot cakes
---
Sneak is useless in this title. No bullshit. It was useful until now. Unfortunately sneaking in 76 is just a waste of perk points.
---
Strange, I always get a cursed melee weapon.
---
I only keep what I think is top tier items that could be useful if I changed from low health build. I’d keep a vanguard AP WWR piece. I won’t keep a vanguard AP durability piece.  
---
I tend to keep good bolstering, chameleon, weightless, unyielding, and vanguard pieces.  Everything else gets recycled
---
Lmao - always stay safe and wear a hazmat suit
---
im not really a sniper build but have used them in the past and it is a huge difference when your low leveled and would like to kill things 2x your level and you want to kill it safely and not be mowed down from something like a lv. 66 SM with a mini
---
...so it happened when a player hit you or when a NPC hit you?
---
Someone data mines the patches and posts pictures of everything coming up. I think if you search ATX you can find it.
---
Especially that high radiation fluid... it’s nuts..
---
Literally this.  I was concerned about it.  Then I downloaded and played the pts.  Not concerned about it at all.

---
They did and have listened. The point of the game is to grind, remember this game is developed in largely the same way a casino is. The point is to give you enough victory to keep you engaged, but definitely to _keep_ you playing.
---
If 3* enemies were plentiful, and if they dropped legitimately good gear consistently it would give some folks some level of closure on their builds. The secondary problem Bethesda has is there is an insanely low number of viable/useful weapons/builds. They could open up the firehose a smidge on legendaries, but less than 5% of legendary weapons are even worth using. 
---
In other games that 5% might be higher, and getting a unique new weapon might make you revisit your entire build. Well, in FO76 you can't revisit your build, because that too is an insanely long grind. So if you get something that doesn't apply to your build, it's trash. Of course, since there's reasonably only 3 builds worth grinding for, it's a moot point.
---
tl;dr - increases in legendary drops would hurt player counts and Bethesda's bottom line. They're not ignoring us, they're designing things to fit their business model.
---
It is always when you have a 15% blocking on out of PA. There has been a long debate about what is magic and not. Most claim you need 180 fire rate or higher. However 2 shot can work. For it to work all the time the fire rate has to be above 140. It will work sometimes at the 120 range which more has to do with lag.    
---
If the server is mostly lag free a TS FFR penta in PA will still do magic if you know the trick. Also a TS FFR mini with the accel barrel can also be magic in PA but again that is reliant on knowing what triggers it and the server needs to be smooth.
---
RNG means nothing to me.even before that last wave I would always find a way to get the gear I wanted by trading or buying
---
Im grinding the hell out of the last few days for this coop. From someone who really wants it, i can tell you, i too have no idea why.
---
If you are running ACP I think you would benefit from the asbestos lining on your chest piece.
---
I’m only level 40 and just made a new hunting rifle that does 131 damage, I think it’s an improvement from my legendary sniper rifle that does 93 damage
---
Yep.  It would be a trophy from the bastard who used to wear it.
---
Why dont you practice what you preach and accept that there are other people in the world who want to do things differently than you? All the dude did was suggest what is the safest way of preventing fall damage to make the jetpack more viable. It's a good suggestion IDK why you had to give dude that sass
---
I see someone told you above but how much of a chore is it to convert ammo in those things?
---
It sends me nuts.
---
Same and same!
---
I ran into my first three star enemy last night. It was a raider with a cool gas mask. I'm in the middle of nowhere up north, hiding behind trees, trying to not get killed. I'm not great at shooters. He was level 46 or something I'm level 42. I finally run up, and claim my prize. I'd never even seen a two star legendary yet. It's a one star junkies grognak axe. I mean, I'm not gonna complain because I immediately got shit faced on drugs and made it my most powerful weapon.... But I was a bit disappointed. But at least it wasn't a rolling pin!
---
It’s fine - if LP shows up just say you grab all rewards so no commie get his hands on it.
---
Aha!  That's the problem.  Thank you, I've got a new skill to work on.
---
No problem I started doing it about two months ago and I kept messing it up
---
Thanks for posting.  I'd hate to fall victim to this.  I just laugh anymore.  Vending is at your own risk
---
Thank you I'll try that
---
Ok many thanks for this.  I'll try now :)
---
The change from multiplicative over to additive for damage modifiers has not had as significant an impact as you and some others have thought. It is still very possible to one-shot most non-boss mobs. And if you kill them before they damage you, healing is less applicable.
---
Even on my non-Bloodied, non-Junkies alt, I’ve only found occasional use for Vampire’s weapons. They are good in the right situations. They have not become the only viable option.
---
The cliffs by Johnson's Acre. Pre-wastelanders, the spring traps would actually launch the skeletons off the edge in a most entertaining fashion
---
Wrong post
---
It has to do with recent exploits, all used the 'trading window' to glitch items into inventory. Beth is aware enough that unlimited ammo would appeal to just about everyone, which is why we're left with the abysmal terminal interface.
---
Thank you for your service to the community
---
Edit: spelling
---
I don't really have a build as of yet but a shotgun would be great. Not gonna complain though, I want to be able to help clear wendigos during the new event. I'm level 65 right now.
---
Curious if its giving the cursed effect to all weapons in your inventory: that would make it a really viable option to carry constantly
---
What are those needed for?  I haven’t done much construction outside of the basics st my
---
Camp like workbenches.  But to be fair, building was my least favorite part of FO4, so I’m not chomping at the bit to get into it.
---
Not that I know of but I'll write a short list for you.
---
Explosive energy weapons (cryo, flamer, laser rifles and laser gatling guns, plasma gat)
---
Explosive harpoon.
---
Anything with the double ammo capacity effect, double.
---
2-3* rippers and dragons.
---
Survival challenge rewards (salt of the earth, unstoppable monster etc.)
---
Do you leave the collectron unlocked?
---
I leave mine in a building for his own good. He safe there.
---
You only need dense upon the chest, I usually go buttressed elsewhere
---
What is PTS from someone who is obviously out of the loop
---
Yes. Why not? Otherwise it’s a week without challenges.
---
Jetpack so you can fllllyyyyyyy
---
Maxed Lone Wanderer gives 30% as well.
---
Deep pockets on limbs. Jetpack on torso
---
Wouldn't have it any other way. Legendary perks can give you fireproof if you want
---
They should just make a different stash box for vending at this point
---
I can't seem to be able to trigger the damage against bosses specifically. tried several magic weapons to the same effect. both in public and private. never tried a blocking piece, though.
---
my guess is that there's just too much latency between me and the servers for it to trigger.
---
Same here. I am late to the bloodied train just when it's about to get nerfed.
---
they are not exclusive,  
---
buttressed is for resistance and dense is the mod
---
Basically don’t server hop. It’s glitchy so it’s hard to tell what really works and for what animal the method works for. I tamed a deathclaw. Followed him to his “stand alone” spot. Fast traveled to my camp and to where he stopped a couple times and poof! He was at my
---
Camp
---
I do rad rumble alot and EVERYTIME I kill a legendary 3star it only drops a 1. Even if I do all the damage.
---
you're fucked. points are gone.
---
there's an atom glitch going on right now and i think it may be linked to fo1st so it's possible they're not starting any new subs or renewing.
---
Same thing happened to me. I didnt realize that this was a thing that occurs.
---
That'd be my assumption as well.
---
Is it not just a scaled down version of the full mesh? i.e. not an actual object?
---
Yea i really hope she's not too upset at all the books. 
---
Let alone all the people throwing live grenades upstairs and blowing things up.
---
As stated by Bethesda it can take up to 72 hours to register. If you havnt gotten it by then, you should open a support ticket.
---
&gt;F76 will lose more than half its player base if all duped &amp; legacy weps were removed.
---
Pure nonsense.   People have said this  about countless changes Bethesda has made to this game and it's always bullshit.
---
BTW ***I don't think duped legacy weapons should be removed.***  I'm just tired of seeing the same  melodramatic post over and over.
---
"Bethesda if you do this you will lose your player base!"  That claim has already proven to be bullshit  hundreds times over and I am tired of seeing it.
---
Bloodied will still be top-dog when the update hits. I'm not looking forward to the nerf but Bethesda have said the system they're working with now will make it easier for them to implement buffs, so maybe everything will be buffed and this is just the first stop. I wish I knew what they're up to
---
Thanks. Just seen the Twitter post , and their ticket page is down.
---
Public test server.
---
Its for PC players only. Its a server that lets bethesda implement changes on the fly and have it be tested by players before actually implementing it into the game.
---
Trade only market is just as trash because of the last dupe. The way I play now is if I don't need it and you do, it's yours. I took out my vending eight months ago and just started dumping what I don't use. I can make all the caps from selling out to the vendors or if for some weird reason I need caps I could just sell some flux to a friend. After awhile there's nothing you really need.
---
They really improved it a lot.  Unfortunately they have largely abandoned it at this point, but when I last played a couple years ago it was fun, especially playing seasons.
---
It was a clusterfuck at launch.  I stopped playing around launch when I was giving serious thought to writing an auction house bot because I could get more loot flipping the auction house than I ever could actually playing.  Then I was like "Wait, if I'm not actually playing the game, what's the point of that?"  They really turned it around later, in part due to a change in project leadership.

---
Submit a ticket. Seems to be an issue with routing the atoms to the right account. Bethesda is actively trying to fix it
---
Thanks, that's good to know. I'm mostly interested in performance against bosses so I'll have to keep an eye out for a good 10mm. My pistols character is a gunslinger/shotgunner (I wanted to see if it was viable) so he needs some way to deal damage to scorchbeasts until they land. Right now my options are a junkies aim damage pipe pistol and a vampire's laser pistol.
---
I heard it’s a bug, I’ve seen some post talking about this recently.
---
Ok cool thanks man!
---
I had the same issue a month ago. Couldn't find anything on it. They took days to fix it. Just assault both steam and Bethesda customer service. They eventually rectify. And I agree with other commenter. The atom issue is tied to this. I had gotten 100k atoms after my issue was fixed.
---
Oh dont knew that, thanks for the information
---
There was some glitched camp items in atom shop being free by mistake, i even have one, techno globe or how it called in English, they let ppl keep those items. Same with Christmas and Halloween rewards being available in NW couple months ago
---
My Chinese Stealth Armor sniper uses the gauss shotty in ACP. Anything gets too close I just jump out of the way. Gotta love marsupial haha.
---
Ah thank you very much
---
It's pretty insane that you got down voted for this. It's pure nonsense to say  that duped weapons are "still in game content."
---
Curious to know what advantage that would give you?
---
not sure why you are asking this here, but, with the repair kits you can repair your gear quite fast on the fly.
---
Crap man, i spend a lot of time thinking about buying or not, and que o bought i get that bug
---
Lol. Whatever. It’s literally part of the game. You’re missing out.
---
Burrows..it's my favorite place. Wish I could build a camp down there.
---
This is great.  The firebreather helmet is by far one of my favorites, and somehow I think I junked it or sold it one day when not meaning to.  I've always wanted to get one again.
---
Roflol, do you even play?
---
Open a ticket asap. I had the issue too on steam. Contact both steam and Bethesda. Took them a few days to fix but assault their customer service.
---
Ah, ok. I was just curious and never got an opportunity to ask
---
No problem. If you hip over to the official bethesda forums there is a PTS section. You can browse that and get a good idea kf changes coming down the pipeline.
---
Heres a link
---
https://bethesda.net/community/category/312/fallout-76-pts?language%5B%5D=en
---
Major changes coming sept 15th.
---
You helped me and as a result I'm now at 100% plans. Tysm! Great community.
---
I only started playing with game pass on pc a few weeks ago, heard it mentioned by youtubers but hadn't experienced it until today (or at least didn't notice it)
---
Submit a ticket, seems to be a know issue currently so I'd put in so if yours is due to that they fix it sooner rather than later
---
That’s nice.  The launch cluster left a sour taste in my mouth and I never really looked back after maxing my Witch Doctor.
---
Ok hit me up in game gt is wetbanditgrim I can go over some options for ya
---
Thanks so much :)
---
Deep pockets on arms, cushioned on legs if you have a jet pack, asbestos lining on chest if you run ACP, dense if you’re using explosive weapons.
---
It's all about having fun playing the game. I have both builds and I like them both.
---
I remember there being a rumor about a super rare White Fire breather outfit. Any truth to that I wonder?
---
I don’t expect to get a 3 star off of a 1 star enemy so I really don’t understand why a 3 star enemy gives me a 1 star rolling pin🤦‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️😤....
---
Damn shame its a glitch. I wish we had dial-a-yield nukes.
---
I suppress all my non heavies. If your sneaking and dont have a suppressor your almost guaranteed to go into Danger and loose any sneak crit bonus
---
I still have mine from day one or two into this games life, I just hope one day I can get the other fire breathers outfit that still eludes me.
---
I like the hidden Chinese listening post base under the golf course a lot
---
I don't think it really maxes out.  You'll get some get from Action Boy/Girl even with 5/5 AP Refresh armor.  But it's all about diminishing returns.
---
I’m Donald Trump and I approve this message.
---
Do a full sneak build with a fixer and least one harder to detect legendary effect. 
---
Bonus points for full unyielding.
---
Then say this again without lying
---
It's possible to run Scorched Earth at lvl 9 if you know what you're doing. I did it with my second character. Now my 5th is lvl 55.
---
Nope, he’s zero again lads
---
I want a kitty or maybe a possum or a fox or something. I could put it in my backpack 🎒 n carry him around 😻
---
Ah so it’s not 180 items and 60 containers then... It’s 250 items on a list.
---
So lemme see if I got this right... Say I pick up the plate of moldy food at the whitesprings station in my private server, then go loot the 300 burnt books in the Summerville house, leave the server, wait 5 minutes for the private server to reset, then join my private server again, and that plate of moldy food will be there again because it’s not on the 250 item list?
---
This is a joke right?
---
Heres a great test post showing actual PTS damage info

Legendary effects do make a difference.

Should’ve just kept them
---
There is its just very rare it drops from feed the people.
---
Although if someone has some Nuka Cola Quantum I’ll always try and snag it lmao
---
You just have to insert the fuse then the blood samples and it finishes. Just did it twice this week.
---
Get your wife a subscription to Hulu, give each dog a scorchbeast bone to chew on, and presto, game time!  Lol.  Don't sweat the dailies...plan them around  the quest line objectives or events..so if you have a quest, a vacuum tube retrieval and kill 10 of something all down in Watoga, you can knock out a couple things at once. Uranium Fever or Wolf Horde are great for knocking out a couple dailies really fast too.
---
You are awesome. Thank you for all of this!
---
There’s a spot in the “attic” under the roof that is torn off and I put them underneath in back toward the edge of the tear iirc. It’s been a while so don’t quote me on that.
---
I wish I could say I was surprised. I'm sorry this happened to you, I would be beyond Triggered. Hopefully you get your atoms and wallpapers and stuff back. That would definitely get me off the game for a while.
---
Yes, exactly.
---
There are plenty of creative pacifist ways to kill people who harass you..
---
I've lured bloodied builds into high rad water and other stuff, and kept them distracted until they irradiated themselves to death like a dumbass and then took their stuff.
---
I've blown up cars to kill low level players who were obviously working with high level players nearby waiting to gank you after attacking back. And then took their stuff.
---
I've lured melee players into dangerous areas, and let them break their melee weapons on my power armored ass. Then stealthed and watched while they got eaten by scorchbeasts because their precious bloodied deathclaw gauntlet was busted (this one was back before repair kits, it was hilarious). And then took his stuff. 
---
I don't go looking for trouble, but I am more than happy to kill someone indirectly if they constantly bug me.
---
I think there is always a chance for that as event loot.
---
They would probably ban you, instead of just removing atom items.
---
And people that have finished already have had multiple weeks without challenges. They aren't changing it.
---
it can happen if you're logged or not. happened to me once logged in and once not logged in
---
Just replying to say I love your casual-sad “I guess” with each post. It’s creating a powerful emotional image of a dude confused and whatevering it.
---
They want handouts as usual
---
I started when it got put up on game pass as well. I didn't know it existed until today. And searched for info about it. I see that this has been a problem. I lost 5,000 points today.
---
You need to revoke your privilege you levelist!
---
Thx.  Yeah same nothing loaded in
---
What game are you playing?  I was at the beginning of chapter 3 when Double SCORE week started this week.  I've since done every challenge and gotten the XP repeatables a number of times and I still won't even be close to completion when it's over.  Plus it's taken far more than 5 minutes- workshop claims, legendary kills, events, etc.  5 minutes is barely enough time to finish the "build up a camp" tasks that often pop up.
---
Dense on chest and deep pockets everything else for me.
---
I had that happen to me. I purposely put all my 5 mm ammo in my stash and then would fire 1 bullet at a time with the minigun. To fix it, IIRC, I holstered my weapon, switched to a shotgun, and then switched back to the minigun.
---
But now, I'm going to try this with a gatling gun to see if I can get it to work without ammo.
---
BTW, I was testing my Vampire's Bashing Shredder minigun, with Basher 2, to see if shredding super mutants would work. It worked great and killed level 68 super mutants in like 1 second. Just doing one run of West Tek required repairing it about two times but it was a lot of fun.
---
Bwa ha ha yup, grab the stuff from the case and hotfoot it out of there before she sees the mess you made. (Like that one Jojo’s episode.)
---
It's not a specific location but a section of the map...i love the mire.
---
It's such a beautiful (and deadly) place to walk around, the dark canopies with the little light that shines trough. The overgrown nature, the creepiness to it 
---
Reminds me alot of point lookout DLC (fo3)
---
Yes. I have no other collectrons. Mine has no options to select what to collect. So far it has found crystal shards, cork scrap and leather scrap. I fear it might be a reskinned scrap collector one.
---
I tend to even scrip vanguard - Adrenal reaction ups the damage for weapons enough that it is worthwhile running at even half-health most of the time.
---
Asbestos for ACP... man, I feel like an idiot now. This never even occurred to me.
---
Yeah teslas are really becoming a problem and my guess is that those using them don't realize they're creating the issue.
---
I'm looking at it right now. It's on the store and collects "mission critical supplies". Says he's available for two days
---
Deep dish + signal repeater= rapid fire death.
---
That’s totally different though because the season was still active. They had challenges, they just award score which is useless if you’ve already made it to 100. 
---
What happens next week is anyone’s guess. You don’t know any more than I do.
---
It is btw what does the Christmas and communism ones do
---
I miss that so much. I would always show up to make sure the server got some XP food
---
Use an alram clock or something, guys. I understand your frustrations, but it gets old. We see this everydays !
---
If you guys are planning to be online before the daily reset, use an alarm clock so you can log off 5 minutes before the reset.
---
It's the best advice i can provide you, i do this myself. ✌
---
Yes - free
---
Hmm I’ll wait and see how it plays out. The display cases were cool at first but then you see all the same stuff and it takes a lot of budget up. See what happens
---
Interesting... Thanks for the info! I’ll be sure to put this to good use. I’ll save the Summerville house and loot it last after a day of playing so it makes everything else respawn.
---
Sounds about right.  They then all log into reddit and bitch about not getting a 3\* item from the legendary radstag they one shot during their heroic attempt at an impossible event.
---
Some are very aware and trolling events with them.
---
Yea. It’s 100% against the falling debris. Works like a charm. It does help a little bit against earles fire spit attack, but only a little.
---
Welding helmet goes well with the engineering outfit. 
---
I've got several of the outfits/helmets/goggles/hoods on my characters just because they're pretty easy to find as long as no one is specifically farming them up for their store...heck I usually sell them cheap in my vendors (about 30 for headwear and 50 for the outfits).
---
100,928 DPS from the handmade? How?
---
I’d prefer the weapon cases if you hoverd over to  let you see the perks on the weapons

GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! WE DID IT!!
---
You guys are fantastic. Without that plan mule I would not know about the 11 plans I am currently missing. Thanks again!
---
If you aren't gaining anymore rep with Settlers AND you are doing the Ward Daily and the Random Encounters....make sure you don't have any of the items he is looking for in your MISC tab in your PipBoy. [This is a list of the things he asks you to find.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vital_Equipment) If you happen to have one of those items on you (you can tell by picking up his quest and then being able to immediately turn it in) sometimes completing his quest with it on you will grant no rep. [Here's a vid on how to maximize Rep gain!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ycZJzw_TU)

The Xmas one can find scrap or Xmas gifts.
---
My Raider version says I can find them too but also chems and alcohol or weapons and ammo.
---
I believe the commie finds weapons and ammo but also can find blood packs.
---
2. Tesla - agree.  Add the trap mod.  When you find a random Tesla with it, fun to play around with.  I’ve kept the trap Tesla, but would prefer to mod a Legendary that’s actually worth the extra weight.
---
If there was more incentive for PvP the community would be different lol. As it stands this is PVE
---
I came back and mine had 6 blood packs lol
---
I believe strange in numbers works.
---
Edit: I confused strange in numbers with a herd mentality mutation.
---
Anti-armor is probably the best one. Especially after the upcoming weapon damage nerf later this month, since it's going to be nearly on par with bloodied from what I've seen.
---
Unfortunately it's not a joke. As a person who owns 4 fallout titledls, the sneak in this game is a joke. I've reached level 100 with 2 characters and never even attempted a sneak run simply because this is the one game where it's pointless. It's a major factor in every other title except this one. I hate it because that was something I enjoyed in every other fallout and elder Scrolls game. I enjoy the game, but some parts were shit on for casual players. Takes weeks and months to finish the other games. You can finish every storyline in a week with fallout 76 and never have to sneak once. You guys can get mad about my opinion but I've been playing these games for well over a decade and 76 is the most soft ass version of fallout I've ever seen. Power armor at level 15? Fucking joke. Sneak is useless next to a power build? Joke #2. Lackluster storyline with barely any RPG elements other than world building? Leave that to Minecraft. I enjoy it simply because it's fallout. Other than that, I've still got the classics and anything obsidian makes.

Glorious Comrade collectbot finds things for leoples revolution.   I've gotten frag grenades blood packs propaganda flyers chinese officer swords and over the course of 6 months 2 handmade.  
---
Raider collectron might be the best finds ammo
---
Advantage? Bruh I just want to know what cosmetics would be out a week ahead what exactly are you implying
---
Well inspirational says right in the deacriptopn you get xp based on number of people you group with. 0x5%=0
---
Herd mentality works.
---
If you want extra xp, get people on your team. If you want to be lone, don’t be on a public team.
---
Strange in numbers requires another mutated teammate. Herd mentality works though
---
It doesn't. Tested egg head, put on the perk and it stayed at 6 Int
---
Never seen anyone state that this was the cause (other people have said they had the issue despite being logged off at reset) Pretty sure I stayed on during the reset other times this season without the issue as well, yesterday or the day before when I stayed on, the game simply closed itself at the reset time anyway, so honestly I was kind of expecting that to happen again.
---
That’s what I’m confusing it with.  After I typed that I was having doubts.
---
You get to something like level 70 to 90 now just doing quests.  Events are optional.
---
If you do events you can just tag stuff and let the high levels finish it off for you and get super fast XP and level past 50 in a few hours.
---
The effect of 1W will be to lower the XP you'd get from something like Line in the Sand so your level 15 with an explosive gun can't tag stuff and end up level 40.  Now you'll probably just end up level 25 or something.
---
True, with secret service and diminishing returns of DR makes sense. I have a junkie char and that one also wears unyielding
---
Edit:autocorrect
---
It is a reskin? Damn. I might have to go get the raider one then.
---
I hate to tell you this but stimpaks kill me every time I have 20% health left or lower. It seems to only occur if there are enemies nearby. Important note, they wouldn’t even be attacking me nor hitting me at all when this happens. I don’t know how this could only happen to me because I know it has to happen to other players and maybe there not smart enough to notice it when it happens. Same thing with grenades. It should be obvious that this crap happens constantly to everyone and not just me. Maybe mind control is being used on everyone to where there not able to notice some obvious things while I’m the only one that’s not controlled by any control device.
---
Yeah but 3 1 Star nocturnal meathooks too?
---
I like coming to r/fo76 Tuesday morning and viewing what's new at work it gives me something to look forward to. In fact I check back here even on the rare chance I'm off before I check the atom shop
---
Essentially Herd Mentality says "on a team" while everything else says teammate in some manner. So you can use Herd mentality solo but nothing else (to my knowledge)
---
Yup.  I goofed.
---
It says 'when you are on a team', not for each teammate like other cards do and I don't think it has ever specified having XP multipliers depending on how full the team is. 'When on a team' implies that being on any team will proc the card. Lone wander says 'while alone' but doesn't work of on a team by yourself so you can see the confusion
---
I don't use the gun one but I do use the armor one. I don't think I have ever repaired my non power armor or my PA.
---
So far I've gotten concrete, rubber, and cork scraps from it. Then I switched it back to something more useful. I'm not sure what it says personality wise, but seems like a dud unless it occasionally gathers something rare.
---
Ahh just saw your edit. Yeah, herd mentality works perfectly
---
Been running bloody heavy PA with Vamp, so that collapsing ceiling fire has been my greatest enemy. Thanks for the tip, definitely don’t much need dense without any explosive weapons.
---
You don’t know what you are talking about.
---
No he's right.  Ultracite comes from the main Brotherhood quest, and it gives you a full set.  X-01 comes from gaining General rank with the Enclave and learning the plans from the terminal in the military wing, next to the MODUS vendors.
---
Don’t care didn’t ask plus this is cringe
---
I wish I had the patience to build those round structures, I learned how to do it almost 2 years ago, but damn getting everything lined up just right is crazy tedious. I really admire the people who can do this, the investment in time alone would drive me nuts when there are so many things out there to shoot and loot.
---
inspirational does work in a team by yourself. first thing i tested when teams came out. i killed a level 62 ghoul and then put on inspirational in a team and it gave me more exp. Unless this has been fixed in the months since teams release.
---
Cool.  I can help you out.  PSN aj ninetyeight.  I am configured as show offline.  I’m in a lull waiting out time gates, so I’ll be on/off periodically throughout  today; will likely be on for extended time after 6 - 7p.
---
Camp is on the acid node just S of monogah power plant.  If the serum is not in the machine, find me on the map - I believe I’m carrying at least one carnivore, and I think grounded is in my stash.
---
&gt;All the challenges added an element into the game that I thought I would have to rush to get done because "FOMO" 
---
I think you're being too hard on yourself here. In the beginning, when we had the original numbers, people were doing the math and finding that if you did everything every day, you were going to end up getting to the end with maybe a week to spare. So it wasn't just FOMO, it was literally "if you want to complete, you're going to have to do this every day". 
---
We didn't know about double SCORE weekends, we didn't know they would give us additional dailies. 
---
I do think it's great that we're more aware now of what the season will be like. Those that want to burn through it 'quickly' still can, and those that stressed about it know they can relax this time. 
---
I also absolutely love that they have made lunchboxes and the functional items from season 1 for sale. That kills at least some of the FOMO.
---
First I heard of it
---
Pneumatic on chest to help with legacy and telsa staggering, ultralight on limbs for more AP to feed dodgy
---
Yup and at times I do explore it, and actually find some cool and interesting stuff, but it's not always a wise decision to spend the time available to play wandering around doing basically nothing but looking around for cool stuff, when I could be doing quests and other stuff that actually has rewards instead of a slight chance of me stumbling onto something. But yeah lol whatever sorry I don't spend my entire experience wandering around, real life responsibilities kinda outweigh that so I focus on getting the grind more than exploring.
---
Yes
---
Chat sent
---
I just tested it and it makes no difference but I'm sure it used to, like you said. Seems a bit weird that they would change it but do nothing to Lone Wanderer though
---
Well...as you can see...you made the mistake to be online at the reset. We see "this type" of post everydays and i experienced it a couple of time too. Use an alarm clock ! ✌
---
It a known issue, don't worry.
---
Oh yeah it does. I forgot about that place
---
Oh god i gotta get on tonite and get it
---
If I was smoking crack I wouldn’t be able to notice the censorship of game bugs and glitches. They must be using mind control on a lot of people to make them not notice things that are obvious.
---
I have only failed once and there was a couple of reasons.
---
1. The others in the event weren't always attacking earle. Sometimes they would just stand there. 
---
2.There was only 4 total in the event.Although i dont think this was as big a deal since we got it down to ~20% health remaining. 
---
3. Earle decided to teleport back and forth between the floor and ceiling for 5 mins pretty much preventing a lot of damage once we got it to ~25% health remaining. He decided to come back out for the last few mins but it was too late.
---
Ok. Im etting on now

In PA you'd want the most effective weight reduction perks, Travelling pharmacy and Thru hiker.
---
Serendipity doesn't work in PA
---
Fusion cores are easy to come by, don't use any related perks unless you are using a gatling laser.
---
Bad guy Commies rie up!

Time to Oppress!
---
Read the description again. +5% for each teammate. 
---
Basically the game logic is like this:
---
Are you on a team? Yes
---
Ok, you aren’t a lone wanderer. 
---
How many team mates do you have? 0 
---
Ok 0x5%=0. 
---
Now what about here mentality?
---
Are you on a team? Yes. this will proc because it’s a binary decision. Team= proc
---
I mentioned a bit later i think he meant the mods
---
It’s still solid on a personal level. Unspoiling food that gives an XP bonus, and IIRC since it’s stew it gives water too?
---
I think when you have multiples you can pic what ot gets... i have the ability to get junk only....or weapons and ammo...or food and drinks...
---
Can the Christmas collectron still give gifts today
---
I am, it's literally on my screen right in front of me
---
Patience is a virtue
---
Not saying i don't believe you but this is the internet after all so i need to see for myself.
---
FOR SCIENCE!!!!
---
They did add an achievement to PTS that should go live with legendary perks. They said they cant fix your concern but they are gonna give everyone 50 perk coins through this achievement to help those who did loose potential coins from changing builds (Become Legendary: Hit level 50)
---
One had an automatic laser gun only to drop a hunting rifle and some .308 ammo. That is just lazy.
---
I'm not sure the second one is called the legendary run. I think they'll have a different name each season.
---
This is absolutely correct
---
What is the full description for inspirational?
---
U know I didn’t even think about using the environment against them, u just gave me some pretty good ideas
---
It's an old known issue. I got back on the game recently after 2 months away. I played an all week without no problem and suddently one day...the reset hit me. When that happens it is known that it "often" happens (if not only happened) on the reset moment. So I highly recommand to you too to use an alarm clock.
---
Never seen or heard of this item... Have a picture?
---
And steel *in* brothers.
---
I play Neverwinter and they have a level cap of 80. But every “level up” after that gains you small rewards. I think it’s a good idea. Wishful thinking though. Doubt they’ll give out atoms so easily.
---
If you're on Xbox you don't need to buy another account. Just set up your Xbox as a home console and then set up another Xbox account to use on that console. Don't buy a gold pass with the account you will still be able to play the game.
---
I wouldn't lie about something you can test yourself, I'm not that goofy haha. But yeah, I'm testing it now and I'm not getting any difference
---
Players who sell stuff would love those who are gonna be capped going on a shopping spree.
---
Towards the end I bought four level ups to get it over with.  So much happier the last couple weeks not having the daily weekly chore list. I've already convinced myself that I am not going to pay attention to it this time and just play.  Pretty sure I will still end up hitting a lot of the dailies and weeklies but at my own pace and not some slave to Bethesda stupidity.
---
People will do anything to try and protect their duped nad/or hacked items.
---
I'm not on Xbox but good to know!
---
So you fix it by deleting the atoms he earned legit as well as wallpapers. You can bet I’m not reporting the bug then
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted. I've honestly tamed dozens of pets and have never seen a tamable cat yet. I only saw a single dog and it never made it to my camp. I did have a level 1 beaver that lived less than 24 hours though. RIP to both of them. :(
---
I’m not 100% but let me check my camp and let you know
---
Other compoments are dropped by creatures within the nuke zone.
---
Agree. I only did it instead of super-dupering because I had thousands of rounds of certain ammo that weren’t selling so I figured, why not? 15 min later....help me I’ve been trapped lol!
---
Eh. They caaaaan be. I got tired of the constant reloading and having to be up on them to make it work. I went to heavy guns because the perk allotment was close to the same.
---
Im guessing you'll just get all your atoms taken away, even the legitimately earned ones.  Let us know what happens. I hope they don't screw you over because they can't make a functional game
---
I don't know but as long as they keep the power creeps from killing bosses before everyone else has a chance to tag them I will support it.
---
I was gonna take one but the dude logged out when I went to screen shot. He had like 360 of them.
---
Adding to it, it has a chance to be killed (permanently) by enemies attacking your camp.
---
You would want a Bloodied or Junkie’s shotgun preferably an explosive variant. They work very well for one shotting enemies but not to handy once a boss fight. You’d be the one dealing with the spawns most the time.
---
My favorite recent experience was a level 22 joining a Guided Meditation event. Despite the event having a recommendation of level 20, and listed as "Easy" I don't think he found the level 68 Charred Ghouls as "easy."
---
I did my best to draw aggro of the ghouls so he could get hits on them for the XP, and to make sure he didn't die.
---
Had a similar experience with the Prime Cuts event in the cranberry bog portion of the map. Where it spawns level 75 Fog Crawlers despite the event being labeled "Very Easy." Nothing is quire as interesting as seeing someone shoot a giant mutated Shrimp with a hunting rifle, and immediately doing a 180 and running the hell away.
---
Care to explain? Genuinely curious
---
Duchess' bed
---
You can see colored ones already in game at Crater. They exist and I will pay an ungodly amount of caps/atoms/gold/scrip to get them! (edit tyops)
---
No, that is not true. Unyielding still provides a full +15 SPECIAL when a full set is worn at low health.
---
JEsus fuck, I've learned my lesson about reporting a bug with the game. Just gonna keep my friggin mouth shut.
---
It would be funny if "mission critical supplies" is just all the things we donated to the BOS...cloth leather cork...bwhahahahah
---
I too share these feelings. But care to elaborate why?
---
Yeah, it's also affected by Carnivore and strange in numbers. So it gives 12.5% bonus XP for an hour instead of 5%
---
All of these are tied to motion blur. My question isnt about that
---
I would have kept this bug to myself for personal enjoyment
---
http://imgur.com/a/23MH2kV
---
Huh.. never thought to do that. And it’s automatically recalled after you FT
---
I’m just waiting for Skyrim 2
---
Ah let me guess... PC? A quick google search says it’s a cut content item from Nuke World, A Fallout 4 DLC. And since lots of items in FO4 are in the dev room on 76, my guess is this dude got this item from the dev room on PC.
---
My vote is for Buttressed first, deep pockets second.
---
Fuck I just wish the heavy ballistic weapons actually had some mods to use. The fact that the LMG doesn't have any sights, or stabilizing barrels or stocks is a little bit of a let down.
---
Absolutely
---
*checks speedometer on delorean* nope only doing 75.
---
Hit lvl 100 on a main account 2 weeks ago (bethesda), and mule account couple days ago (steam). Never had an autocomplete, not a single time, always loging before reset and was just fine on both accounts
---
What does Bethesda expect when people are giving large amounts of free money? People are going to spend it. They’d be kicking away what little of a player base they have left
---
Yeah so if u need to travel to ur camp just put it down and it'll automatically be in ur inventory once you get there.
---
I am gonna get downvotes...but, with the mods that are coming out on nexusmods, which change the way your character looks to you, and only you, why are cosmetics so important?
---
It would definitely be out of line, considering the game is buggy as hell and has errors like this all the time. Banning a player for your own mistake is the dumbest thing they could do. Plus, the person who posted lost all their atoms and wallpaper as they said, so everything or a lot of what they had was taken from them that they already earned anyway lol. They need to fix their system. That's all it boils down to. Not ban players. Its fraud for people to pay for Fallout 1st and not get the rewards or atoms every month, so ban Bethesda.
---
I have seen this occur occasionally, it was independent of tesla's being used in the area.
---
Oddly enough, I recall seeing it in the same place during one violent night.
---
yup
---
Nice. Thanks
---
I believe they're working on it. As of right now the atom count is zero but there isnt any access to the atom shop or legendary run for me, as well as my fallout first not working. Can't use my private world, scrapbox, tent etc. You can definitely believe im not renewing my sub in November. I love the game series, but i honestly can't justify giving them more money for this sub-par game.
---
So I'm going to spend every cap... Down to 0, just to claim my 30k?
---
Thatd be such a hassle with no new cap sink to waste them on. Like you said nobody is going to claim a currency when they're not going to get the full amount, but then you can either not reward max currency or have a cap at all.
---
The main menu, it’s the only non-bugged part.
---
I get it, but those of us who just recently started playing the game had no idea. Does contacting bethesda support help or do they respond with a "tough shit" type of message?
---
Depending on context, this might be a love letter.
---
I don't see why they don't. Maybe it's so if you have a skin on 1 weapon you won't have to pay for it to be on every weapon so the price is lower, but that's just my guess
---
Thank you.
---
MODUS in a bot would be pretty cool.
---
Explosive !? lol it looks...hum...dangerous. Are you sure !? 😅
---
I vaguely remember someone saying something getting it out of a  dispensing machine by doing the associated Responders Belching Betty Quest multiple times. It was when I first started playing so I'm probably not remembering the terminology correctly.   Does anyone have any links to the white outfit? I cant seem to find it online.  I'm probably just not looking smartly enough.
---
In terms of radiation?
---
Right? The LMG has no mods that can be interchanged apart from the receiver and due to this the 90% weight reduction perk doesn't work properly due to the default weapon being classed as modded
---
Still waiting for a Plasma Caster skin 😔
---
Yeah, I'm fine with singular builds, but sadly the game isn't designed around having multiple specialized characters either. I get great drops on the wrong character all the time. :-| 
---
We just need some way to reliably move equipment between characters ... e.g. a shared stash.
---
You must have been the one bailing out my alt last night.
---
I may have confused with body guards. Either way, you need a teammate to inspire...
---
I pray daily for a furious Mr handy blade

Back in the early days of 76, before I had 3* everything, I loved my  mundane Mr handy blade

Let me see if i can go track it down.[I found this list theres 2 uniforms you can get from events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview#gid=63173560)
---
Holy crap does it really collect basic scrap?
---
I was joking when I said that in a different post, but really?
---
Serendipity allows me to dodge the planet most times on big falls.
---
Have died before tho from just doing tiny hops down a smooth incline, but because my ending position was way lower than my starting position I splatted on landing despite never having been higher than a foot or more the entire time.
---
Yes, just run Fireproof under END and you’ll be fine. I use an explosive Minigun and shoot at my feet and I don’t die haha.
---
If you can arrange for them to be at your camp, you can sometimes get melee attackers to run over spike boards. Place them down while backing up, or have a blueprint of spike board minefield pre-prepared.
---
If they are using explosive legendary weapons (especially rapid fire ones or shotguns), get right up in their face and let them shoot you. If you are lucky and they don't have dense mod or fireproof, they may kill themselves with the AoE damage from their shots.
---
Letting people kill themselves with their own stupidity is quite satisfying.
---
You’re negative though 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don't blame you at all. I'm glad when I was thinking about subbing I didn't. They definitely don't deserve our money. I like the game but it's so broken it's ridiculous. Everytime I try to play it I can go a little while before hitting a game breaking bug or crash that just ruins the experience for me lmao it's super disappointing but for some reason I keep trying, hoping it won't happen again, and it always does.
---
That is nice, yes but I’m also talking about energy and overall damage taken.
---
The only real endgame is grinding/trading for better gear. Once quests are all completed you must embrace the grind. But it's your build so you do you.
---
Wait, Inspirational doesn't check how many people are in the team. It checks if you are in a team and then the rank of the card. "When you are in a team, gain %5 more xp." A team of 4 couldn't give you %20 more xp, it's just %15 for the 3 ranks.
---
Was just wondering if there was a legitimate reason or if you were just impatient. Thanks for clearing it up!
---
Chat sent for xb1
---
It's possible lol
---
Wendigos tend to back flip alot when I whip it out during ACP.
---
Going through the work of setting of Nukes on Mona Mine, then having a few level 9's join the event. Me dying over and over trying to take on the boss. When there should be a damn level cap in the first place so this doesn't happen. Boss dies finally, too bad I'm dead and can't loot the body, respawn bug puts me outside the mine. I'm just tired of it all. I'm just going to stick with SQB from now on.
---
When fighting Earl, you won’t get any stealth modifiers if other players are in power armor and firing heavy weapons....the server will decide the enemy you’re hitting is in agro and will reject your request for extra damage.  In short, it’s tough for stealth comandos to kill Earl in a public fight.  Instead, put in Tormentor and keep his body parts crippled...this helps heavies a lot.  And try to keep adds off heavy gunners...the staggers keep them from hitting the main target.
---
oh right those things
---
Ya, i dont thunk it works. I have it maxed and I wear my PA everywhere, ut has never self repaired. I have the gun one maxed, and it repaurs every 5 shots lmao
---
why are you responding to me on this?  It’s 16 days old, just go report your ticket and if you want tell people about the bug on here.  
---
They’d till don’t have magical abilities to censor the internet
---
It's really annoying because each section can be easily solo'd with 1 person. And the easiest section, the Radstag one is the one everyone always groups up in. And that's because the event has the same problem as all the others where it's more beneficial to farm for xp and junk than the event. And the Radstag area spawns cave crickets, yoi guai and honeybeasts. While the other two don't spawn nearly as many enemies. And are just running in circles collecting materials.
---
Bah, I have over 10k comment karma to burn on salty babies like the ones who downvoted this entire thread XD
---
Worth it? It’s free.
---
it's fucking free, my dude. don't like it? don't use it.
---
You've never even launched the game have you?
---
Can we get a Hoarder flair?
---
Salt bombed the whole block
---
my money is on the autocomplete bug.
---
Exactly. Not to mention how broken the trading system is, even if you did want to use it
---
Fuck yeah, we need that.
---
I can't answer for the other ppl who complained about that, but a quick research in the research tool may helps you, because there's alot of complainers...
---
It's the best suggestion i can provide you. Sorry !
---
That could be. As an oddball I have had magic work with high latency also but it is not something that easy to replicate.   
---
But yes smoothness is one key you need above 50 FPS for it to be highly efficient. The worst is when someone brings a tesla to any fight that causes frame stuttering and yeah it becomes a chore to bypass say on the queen or ACP you need to be right up in their faces, in fact thinking on it now I always get the best results when face tanking doing magic unless there is zero other people around.   
---
The reason I found that the TS FFR works is I took a mirelurk queen out in 1.5 seconds at beyond max range I was shocked (did a game clip of it) after that it has been my go to magic gun.
---
Ah yeah 278 levels I never even play it man
---
A quiet one.
---
I suppose but you can technically inspire yourself. My issue is mainly why does 1 perk work as intended but the other doesn't, yaknow? Just seems weird to me
---
Finally, someone with the guts to mention this.
---
What am I, A Communist?!?
---
Of course not!
---
I build porta potties when I want to just hide
---
Yea I guess the logic is more “do you have
---
Anyone on your team, yes or no”
---
Where they spawn and attack is entirely dependent on where players are. Line in the Sand has similar spawns, it’s what allows for the tent glitch.
---
But let me tell you, if you have a high damage ranged build (bloodied rifles or heavy weapons; pistols might work but I haven’t tried it), getting out there and farming the ghouls is fantastic. Tons of XP, tons of ammo/junk, and very high chances of legendaries- my highest record is 6 legendary ghouls from a SOLO run of the event. 
---
I sit on top of one of the pagodas in the water; if I’m there alone, only a couple ghouls go to the Bridge side, most go to the other side. I can sit up there and VATS the entire horde as it tries to pass. A bloodied or instigating Gatling gun works great for a HW build; lever action is my weapon on my rifleman but I have issues having to reload mid rush! Still almost always clear each wave. 
---
I’ve tried to do it with a melee or shotgun build; I couldn’t make it work with trying to run around to be close enough.
---
Ok i wasn't aware it was that effective. I use this perk myself.
---
Aside from the fall damage perks/mutations Leg Effects etc....when you are falling and trying to slow yourself with a jet pack, YOU MUST have that last burst from the pack increase your upward trajectory, even a fraction of an inch, and it will save you as Fallout likes to calculate your fall damage from the last highest altitude you were at. So, at the last second when you are close(ish) to the ground and you can survive a small fall, boost yourself up higher even just a TINY BIT and you will land just fine every time. 
---
ETA: I'm a low health build and I kill myself with my own gun every day...but never die from falling!
---
So yeah. I had to suppress my mutations as i was getting an INT bonus from herd and getting more xp. Got exactly the same xp in and out of party with Inspirational on. 
---
BOOOO!
---
Just the same shit that everyone else complains about on a daily basis. I'm just more candor and to the point with my complaints I guess.
---
I commented the image of the description so it isn't sadly, otherwise this would have made perfect sense and I wouldn't have made a post about it. (That sounds passive aggressive but I mean it in the lightest way lmao)
---
Floor, not cap.
---
Secret Service is best. Combat provides great Ballistic resistance, Leather provides great energy resistance. Marine gives a mix or Ballistic, Energy and Radiation resistance. Metal has great Ballistic resistance too but most people avoid Metal, Raider, Trapper, Robot and Wood Armor. Stealth Suit is a glorified Hazmat Suit, it offers the same resistance as a Hazmat with added Damage Resist. Power Armor has great resistances too but is lacking Legendary slots.
---
Inspirational DOES work in solo team
---
And wait until you find out about Empath
---
Watch some Angry Turtle vídeos if you don’t want to do proper research yourself.
---
Probably the whole area around Summerville lake and Charleston. Mansion row, the broken damn, new gad, ruined Capitol building... So many cool little spots to explore.
---
See, backed by science™! I swear it used to give an increase, same with lone wanderer but apparently not. I was wondering why I was taking more damage from Earle and it seems these 2 perks have been diddled by Todd
---
Does anyone know where to get Wraparound Goggles?
---
Bethesda don't fix bugs. They mass produce them.
---
Omg it was bliss finishing the Run. Not having to log in and do "chores" everyday and just play the game has been heaven.
---
I got quite the laugh out of this
---
Clearly you have never had the daily reset bug.
---
I prefer my approach of doing literally nothing and getting all the rewards anyway.
---
\*laughs\*
---
F
---
Others may have a different opinion, but I'm not sure White Knight is really needed, PA armor breaks so slow already.
---
Maybe feed an extra point into adrenaline.
---
If you want bigger explosions, Perception has a perk for that, you could swap between that and glow sighted to do more damage to glowing enemies.
---
Yes it is, you just need to be as tanky as possible...because you will pretty much aggro everything.
---
Here a lil exemple, if it can inspire you:

---
[Edit:] I don't know how effective a bloodied shotgun build can be with an Unyielding armor set. But i finaly gathered my courage and bought an all Unyielding armor set for this character...so im about to know today lol
---
Ok thanks, someone was messing with me then
---
That's not really fair, they do fix bugs. They'll fix one bug and introduce 20 more
---
I saw another post guy hit over a mil in atoms 😂
---
That is amazing
---
Wait, there’s a Nuka Cola machine display item?
---
Please tell me that it doesn't use grenades, just sheepsquatch shards as thrown knives.
---
If I could show you a video I would but it doesn't work, hence the post. It used to work but it no longer does. I have just tested this myself, so has another user, you can test it too but I promise you, this card has been fiddled with along with lone wanderer. I don't know when it happened but as of today (when I noticed it and tested it) it no longer works
---
Big Fs.
---
So your problem is a colossal problem?
---
278 levels and you've never gotten stuck on the main menu?
---
Exploit reported enjoy your ban
---
Does the collectron have any unique voice lines, like some of the other variants?
---
I play 6h a day and I just finished my play session 10min ago and I can assure you it works just fine.
---
That is fucking golden, my dude.
---
I’ve crashed in a loading screen going into a game but that’s the closest I’ve gotten to any bugs on the menu
---
Does it have a good voice? Maybe it’s better than
---
I JuSt LOooVE SoNgS DONT YouuuuuUUUU
---
Can we also get an F for everyone who scripped a TSE and will really be regretting that soon?
---
Fortunately for you good sir by time you get it we will have instanced interiors and your camp budget will have a lot more free space.
---
My poor egghead character is constantly being called weak. Poor guy is going to snap one day...
---
Those are good points but often when this occurs the event would stay there for a long time and not just the connection lagging out or anything like that. That’s what makes be believe that Bethesda is doing the fake public event thing on purpose to troll people in an act of showing they don’t give a crap about their fans.
---
Correct it is created in your own mind but it is not something you chose to create, in most cases you don't even realise it until someone draws your attention to it, it is not something that is controlled by willpower at all.
---
It is part of the psychology of the individual, and is in every individual to a greater or lesser extent, which is why companies (advertising/games/manufacturers) spend millions of $'s every year using it to promote brand loyalty, and retain existing customers.
---
Im level 260 and I don't think I was aware there was a downstairs
---
Ark pvp is different I used to run with a mega tribe when I was addicted to it
---
And among the lines you die everything you have on you goes with you if you manage to make it back to your stuff you can collect everything back again but in the middle of a raid someone can pick it up 
---
Also raids can go across servers but once you put an item into the transfer pods to switch severs.. your items can *"spoil"*  in there so it's best to take them out as fast a possible 
---
And with storage there is no *"stash box storage"* each individual storage box has its own storage so if a certain bases has all the main storage and it get hit that team will be hit hard since they lost a lot of items 
---
The ark pvp can take hours to days depending on tribe sizes
---
I don’t know because I don’t work for them but I imagine they expect people to not exploit bugs, since that’s a basic expectation of multiplayer games. They also probably expect someone to be childish and entitled enough to do it anyway and thus made a way to ban those people for failing to live up to the more basic expectation. I’d guess that since pretty much every game like this operates that way.
---
No there's just some moron that keeps spamming demanding that nerf
---
This guys right. This isn’t fallout 76 worship sub, it’s just fallout 76 sub
---
Good call, I usually just make sure I have buffout or similar chem for these instances but this is better option.  Feels weird to abandon PA but like stated it will automatically recall to you so again good call.
---
It was an atomic shop item. I want to say a free one, but I could be very wrong lol.
---
What's the exploit? All in-game mechanics.
---
I'm more reporting this here so Bethesda will fix it.  They just need to make the scrap components less for leather arms.
---
It's pretty impractical for the time spent.
---
Same my 3 dogs all died :(
---
I've grown tired of people emptying out my drink dispensers in 1 sitting for caps.
---
Then swapped to just pure nuka shine, but then they were still doing it.
---
And that's arguably alot more work to set up.
---
So had to mix up the 2.
---
Would just put in radioactive goo in there if it let me.
---
I like mixing up the machines with the doors to confuse players as to where my vending machines might be.
---
Have a couple with just walls behind them but nuka cola girls on there looking back.is a fun way to make a space for players to hide in.
---
Tho there seems to be quite a few people who have no idea nuka doors exist so they don't even attempt to look any closer when they reach that apparent dead end and immediately fast travel away.
---
Then of course the next issue is the ones who do leaving all the doors open.
---
I also wish that the nuka machines/ doors were all the same size. Or that the doors didn't have that stupid frame behind them. Biv's doesn't. Why I gotta mix up all 3,  to disguise the size differences,  tho with metal walls the frame on the door is very diminished.
---
Bringing shame upon the name of Swamp.
---
Damn, how’d I miss that? I got the door and the pristine one, but I missed that? Hope it comes back around.
---
A peak of what's to come.
---
I heard If you’re a FO1st member,there’s a similar technique wit the stalker armor...
---
There was a post on here yesterday about it,but for the life of me I can’t find it now.
---
Ah I think those you can get from raider station vendors. Try the station near sunnytop.
---
It doesn't, I'm on right now and it isn't making a difference. I've tested sentry bots at the same level, mutants at the same level and ghoul at the same level and it makes no difference. The only difference I get from XP is from herd mentality proccing due to me entering a team by myself, so maybe that's where you're getting confused?
---
A ghoul or friendly super mutant ally could be fun.
---
I like this idea it add to the look of the weapons but I can see it having issues with clipping on cloths and power armor.
---
When you say heavy explosive perk do you mean like tge missle launcher and fat man or explosive varient of a ballistic heavy gun?  
---
Also power armor breaks so slow white knight isnt necessary. Power user is only if you are using an energy heavy gun or going to use a jetpack mod, but since you are bloodied id go with emergency protocols over jet pack.
---
That's what they said about super duper with Assaultron helmet to print screws
---
I either can't keep them up or can't get rid of them and accumulate 80lbs of nuka cola. There's really no in-between.
---
Rocking 2 piece of fall damage for months now and cant go back to normal
---
Yup.
---
Wood is better.
---
Exactly. You’re not doing anything that’s an exploit. It’s no different than crafting Gatling Lasers with Super Duper 3 to get extra Fusion Cores.
---
No, they're not viable without the magic damage bug
---
I want Davie so he can say *"Yay it's slippy out!"*
---
I’m certain. It’s a shame I want their tech over being able to fight them.
---
If you own the base of a different collectron, cant you just change what it searches for with the terminal?
---
I only have the xmas one, but im sure I read people can change it to different search modes via the terminal.
---
Earle
---
@[Papa\_Shekels](https://www.reddit.com/user/Papa_Shekels/) @[Aurick\_411](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aurick_411/) Quality expansions should be what keeps players coming back. Instead we have the daily proof of life system where we're invited to do menial tasks in exchange for cosmetics not of our choosing and an invitation to pull the handle of various slot machines. It's gaming at the absolute bottom of the barrel. I have yet to drop a single nuke.
---
Bag of fertilizer, a Molotov Cocktail and a "You Have Been Insulted" note. More panache!
---
I'm happy that it's free don't get me wrong, it's great that it is. I just feel let down in a way, It's clamiable now for the next 2 days and it says "The BoS Collectron searches for mission critical supplies around your C.A.M.P"  It's refering to the Fortifying Atlas Event.
---
 The "Misson Supplies" Subroutine makes it go and nab the scrap previously and currently needed to donate during the event and that's not bad collecting specific scrap in anyway, it also has some cool voice lines, my favorites "Why should I give supplies to you?" Giving a Brotherhood vibe for hoarding and collecting technology.
---
I had high hopes for the potential of the BoS Collectron, predicting it would've been the opposite of the Raider Collectron in it'll get us Energy Ammo instead of Ballistic Ammo but this the first I felt let down by Bethesda but that won't stop me from playing the game.
---
I've got a Brotherhood Character and this will be a wonderful addition to my BoS Inspired Camp, I'll just use the Raider's Ammo Subroutine. So I'd like to give thanks to everyone that donated cloth during the event and your enjoying the BoS Collectron.
---
Uh, x3.75 damage multiplier and chaining stealth is something you can only do with a silencer.
---
I guess you don't need that if you never leave the forest.
---
I remember in Fallout 4 where you can get power armor at level 2, but what do I know?
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
I made some changes....  (grin)
---
RNGesus, hallowed be thy drops. Thy 3*'s come, thy will be CRUMBS, in Mama Murghs as it is in events.

Give us this day our DAILY ROLLING PINS, AND FORGIVE US OUR SCRIPTS, AS WE FORGIVE THOSE WHO STEAL LEGENDARIES FROM US.  AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT DELIVER US FROM GOD ROLLS. 
---
For thine is the worst, the cruelest, and the most stingy. 
---
Ramen.
---
I always did leader of the pack anyway for low level 1 star legendary items for new chars and now that is gone.
---
You should had bought everything in the atom shop first. That's what I did with GTA5 back on ps3. I had billions and billions of dollars, so I bought every single thing available at the time. My career earnings still say I am like -450 billion dollars, but up to a certain point I owned everything available for purchase.
---
I choked on my food reading that. Lol
---
I have an alt that made leather left arms all the way to level 60
---
Interesting... thanks!
---
Came across a guy with all the chess board pieces in his vendor on Xbox. I’m almost lvl 300, never seen them once ever before.
---
you're right. inspirational does NOT work in solo team.
---
where you're wrong tho is that it NEVER DID
---
i just checked my own notes of tests i did and rewatched the segment of Angry Turtles video tests.
---
Inspirational never ever worked in a solo team (maybe on PTS, but never on live)
---
EDIT:- Lone Wanderer is useless nowadays, everyone does public teams (building for extra INT)
---
\- Inspirational works as soon as a 2nd person is in the team, also easy to achieve. hence worth always equipping this card now instead of Lone Wanderer
---
\- Herd Mentality also works in solo team
---
\- and so does Empath, alltho this required some AngryTurtle testing to demonstrate, as the positive effect is NOT listed anywhere in the pipboy. but basically the +reduction effect also works on yourself, cancelling out the negative and as soon as a 2nd person joins the team, you start gaining positive damage reduction
---
\- EDIT2: strange in numbers does NOT work in solo team, however to test this properly you have to a) leave teams, b) remove the card &amp; check your specials and c) join solo team &amp; check your specials. because pipboy doesnt update the numbers properly otherwise
---
Can other players kill your new pet?
---
Exploiting a bug is wrong. Taking things you don’t own is also wrong and despite what is the case in video games tends to come with consequences. Criticizing Bethesda’s bugs while exploiting them or encouraging others to exploit them is not justice, it’s hypocrisy.
---
Takes one to know one...   :p
---
That was very profitable
---
solar armor. it has the stats of scout armor, with set bonus effect. if you have above 60% health it constantly heals you. even DURING combat.
---
Ye flying is just aiming at teh ground and missing.....
---
I don't want them because they look like shit.
---
Good point, i forgot the dice roll on if the body falls through the mesh
---
I remember using that glitch to loot Colonel Autumn in Fallout 3. It's an incredibly useful "feature" of Bethesda still using the same engine.
---
Mix of standard Collectron and Raider collectron
---
Using a Gauss shotgun at close range is a recipe for death, fireproof or not lol.
---
But my real life friends already make fun of me for playing this game.
---
Nice
---
Company Tea
---
Oooooh! I was talking about the season rank rewards which are already revealed. Atom shop will always have more exciting stuff, I was just interested in the free stuff ;)
---
If you're on PC I'd be happy to help on your next Queen run
---
If i didnt already have the stealth suit to pretend im a commie to dig in on CCaPpala(china) supporters &amp; really role this play, id love to smear that shit all over myself to blend in but i just dont have too 😅
---
I know, but it's hard to find creatures in the nuke zone.
---
Unpopular opinion: your wrong it’s the one thing the game did correct. For 3 reasons. 1 it keeps the market from being over saturated with 3 stars (the dupe broke this but eventually it will balance again) 2 the RNG isn’t that low for 3 star drops it just feels that way sometimes I think it’s like 20% and 3 there are tons of three stars on every map as static spawns plus the queen 3 time plus random RNG I say if I’m actively hunting 3 stars I can find at least 30 in an hour.
---
I would love to see the Tesla rifle fixed and every other weapons in game fixed too. Unfortunately Bethesda does not fix game bugs with anything that has to do with weapons and combat. They are only capable of adding weapons although they would unfortunately screw that up to. These were just cool weapon ideas that I had for Fallout 76 and 5. Maybe far in the future Bethesda won’t have weapons that are bugged like the Tesla rifle you mentioned. This probably won’t be possible until the 2040s and beyond.
---
I probably confused the XP increase from herd mentality and tricked myself into thinking it worked at one point lmao, I've tricked myself. But weirdly the description implies that it should, as it says 'while on a team' not 'while part of a team'. Seems like something small but it could trick anyone
---
Yeah, unfortunately
---
Congrats, I have a draft sitting in my posts folder on a trading sub and just can't pull the trigger for dealing with the trades on the last 10 plans I'm looking for.
---
So it makes you mad that they don’t use fast travel? What are you doing?
---
I just want the option to romance my collectron.
---
Nocturnal pitchforks...so much fun
---
I never encouraged they use this exploit to their advantage, I said they shouldn't be banned should they choose to do so. Bethesda is blatantly robbing people who are paying them for benefits when they don't provide them, and that is stealing, and stealing actual money from their fans and consumers. Its despicable, honestly. I'm glad I havent payed for 1st and definitely never will now with shit like this happening.
---
Go to the launcher and try to download it.
---
Not a patriot but still and anti-communist
---
Online games (or rather, games as a service) do not survive with only quality expansions, you need a daily player count to rely on to help keep the economy stable and allow for players to team up, unless the game is of competitive nature. 
---
There has to be some sort of grind, be it for gear where your looking for the next number upgrade, or daily faction quests.  Games that do survive without things like RNG tend to be the ones where they put the server in the players hands, and the players create their own rules sets or mods to cater the server to their liking. 
---
If the RNG was removed from this game, it would die out quickly.  Everyone would be sporting the best gear quickly and would blow through any quality expansions that they released and then be done.  
---
If you want them to maintain the game themselves, then you have to expect something like this.
---
It was funny Autumn’s 10mm pistol was one of the best pistols in the game... But you couldn’t get it through any normal ways. Had to like put your back against the glass, go in third person, and you could loot both him and Father... I remember that.
---
You mean... People actually do this event right? Lol
---
1009,28 not 100,928. Bloodied weapon+mutation+all perks
---
The problem is that it'll take to like level 600-700 to get everything.
---
Filthy communist bastard
---
this is par for the whole course yo
---
It’s debatable, but stealth + shotgun works really really well.  Can kill the level 75 wendigos with 1-2 shots.  Or ohk ghouls in radiated zones.  Having VAT perks helps immensely.   
---
And people mention the magic bug, but the shotgun is glitchy in itself due to server lag.  My kill ratio is a lot less when I’m just hip firing the shotgun, versus VATs aiming.  Perks that help regen your crit, gun fu, and others help here too
---
The raider scavenger bot is the best. " If I don't get a good cut I1ll be cutting you" or " It will be easier to just steal supplies"
---
yes
---
When damage nerf will be released your pistol build turn in potato. So, pistols need to be little polished
---
It’s almost like they want to be Destiny
---
I think you find them in a house in Morgantown idk where exactly
---
The ban may have been accidental. A month ago they accidentally banned a ton of people but they were unbanned by the next day. I didn't even know you could use a cheat engine on the Xbox
---
Same dude. It's such a good weapon especially with instigating
---
Excellent... thank you I will look tonight
---
Fun fact: there is no statistical difference between a 1-star and 3-star legendary
---
Mines and orbital strikes mostly with a Gatling gun for the more lively critters. I go for a more upper crust, stiff upper lip with a hint of psychosis vibe. “The Cranberry Bog is a lovely neighborhood except for the minor bat problem.” That sort of thing. It’s all Deathclaw Wellington and plenty of Nuka Dark, maybe an occasional little bit of Fury when things get really frisky. Given your username, I’m sure you get it.
---
&gt; Tempted to move some points from END to CHA, it's a work in progress. 
---
Yeah, you better do that. Not sharing a single rank 1 card because of charisma neglect is a heinious crime worthy of getting kicked from any team.
---
I never said that. People can walk or fast travel as they please. He's saying we fast travel "too much" as if I'm going to walk every single place I go instead of using a system that was put in the game for the players convenience when I don't have time to walk everywhere. What are you doing? Not reading I'd guess lol
---
This is why i always wear my PA, no fall damge is legit the only bonus lol
---
My most favorite spot is near Harpers Ferry on top of the cliff. Looking over HF and being accompanied by the lonely dog calms me down somehow.
---
And the second star was "weighs 90 pct more"
---
**Please. Assume. The. Position **
---
**The numbness.  Will. Subside. In several. Minutes. **
---
I don't care if I'm level 3 or level 600, I'll always do FTP.
---
Jetpack was programmed for power armor which gave immunity to fall damage. Lazy code.
---
About a week before I got the chicken coop I had worked it out, that at the rate I was completing the challenges, I would finish the board by the final week, possibly having to purchase the last 2/3 levels, and then all the bonus challenges, double score weekends came along and I finished 2 weeks early.  
---
Now Season 2 seems reasonable, i'm not thinking I have to do "everything" now, I can incorporate the challenges into my gameplay and not rush to complete them all.
---
Or temporarily equip any weight reduction perks you don't normally have on.
---
You say problem, I say challenge! :D
---
it just says buy now
---
Some of the stuff is missing.. In the pts you could see everything thing that coming but on the forums some of the stuff were removed
---
Raider would make a lot of sense as it's one of those brute-force rip-your-face-off kind of weapons that fancy enough to be used by raiders, but too fancy to be used by supermutants, of that makes sense? I'd buy it
---
Yeah 9 time out of 10 there's nothing there.
---
Yeah pc. He was a lv 653 so maby.
---
yepp, check my edit above with more info
---
Prolly not then.  There's a separate entry for the pts though.  But sounds like the answer is no.
---
Not challenge, just time put into killing about a billion super mutants.
---
I had a week where I had this issue constantly, then a couple of sessions where it worked, now it doesn't work again.  Xbox.
---
They would work so well, just as they have done IRL. What I would die for is a useable bipod simply for the mowing-them-downness points
---
I know you kept the ammo and changed the story for simp karma
---
Mannequins were data-mine so put the outfits on em and use em as target practice
---
When do we get him?
---
Ahhhh!! Thats what it does!
---
...
---
Out now!
---
Angry Turtle responded to one of his commentors that it's still broken.
---
The info about SiN is a good shout, not many people will notice this. I didn't know this until 2 weeks ago
---
Charisma boost should 100% be from having a cigarette/cigar. It fits the 50s theme for style and coolness. 
---
I also think the bike is an endurance thing, that or a treadmill.
---
I mean the contents of the supply drop are only good if you're like, under level 20 it seems. I wonder if you get better loot if you use a radio tower in a higher level area...think I have like 60 tapes in my stash lol
---
Lol thx I was looking for him a few hours ago.
---
PS4
---
Interesting. I have my suspicions that they intend to leave VATS disabled for PVP.
---
Edit: I assume you're talking about on the PTS
---
Will definately look into this, I know I'm missing plans, but how many, who knows. I appreciate what you guys do thanks a bunch 😁👍🏼
---
It was a damage bug, I dont know if they patched it, but certain Legendary effects recreate the furious effect only it doesnt have a cap, so in theory each consecutive shot would be stronger and stronger. You can look up the glitch on the sub and youtube. Like for instance Stalkers FFR LMG does it.
---
The armor one doesn't work with the PA but there is a perk in intelligence that if maxed out makes PA take forever to break down.
---
Frat house
---
You can turn it in for script. Its a legendary item. Combat wise they are completely useless. you throw one explosive bullet. They are not worth 30k
---
Idk. It sure feels like it. Is there any data behind this?
---
Thank you for listing what he collects! What are some of the lines he says by the way?
---
Ah, i swapped that for fix it real good XD
---
The inoculation isn't a "cure" for the Scorched Plague. It's a preventative measure so that the newcomers don't become Scorched when exposed to the plague from Scorchbeasts. I feel like that's something people leave out all too often and the game doesn't do a very good job of explaining. If it was a cure then you'd be able to turn Scorched back into normal humans.
---
Can you scrap gating lasers for a profit to infinitely make more?
---
It’s possible I misunderstood. I read your comment as saying that getting a ban would be out of line for exploiting a bug. If that wasn’t what you meant I apologize. 
---
If you did mean to say that I do think it would be encouraging though, if members of the community were against consequences for exploitative behavior? It would make it seem like there was permission or extenuating circumstances. That’s what I’m getting at.
---
Seriously that shit is just insulting. The exchange rate is terrible too. 
---
The only use I find is making huge amounts of railroad spikes and converting those.
---
I'm with ya
---
Ah, that's the nice thing about One Wasteland hardly anyone talks about: you can now farm XP pretty much wherever you want.
---
Yes - they give the same exact effect.
---
All the star impacts is the loot list that rolls legendary
---
That’s a lot, so glad Bethesda’s IT team is making a federal case out of this and fixing it as fast as they can /s
---
im killing everything in my farming route in two shots with my current set up i dont need the 15% more damage.
---
so the 3 points is 6 % more exp per kill and that is way more exp over a few runs.
---
I knew that.  But that's a good point.  Xp farming will be so much better.
---
Any Stalkers weapon.lol
---
I want to believe you but has this been looked into already? Anywhere?
---
Nuking camps
---
I'll keep him out if he says "You are such a tool"
---
True, but there is always going to be some one who is a higher level.
---
edit: And no. private server would be boring! it would be the same problem from before the npc update. empty
---
Thanks, gonna give him a message someone on reddit is pushing harassment on him for rightfully flipping you off for messaging him outside of game. Is your reddit name the same as your gtag or does he already have it? since we are going to harass people over a video game ...... ill hit up microsoft for ya too.
---
This would be amazing, thank you!!
---
Hey, that's not fair. Sometimes I get a golf club! LOL
---
Dataminer
---
I miss having those huge ammo packs from the older games. They totally could end up being backpack skins in the context of 76, that wouldn't be so bad.
---
I will need to look at the update.
---
Should have fast-traveled out.
---
Yes. The idea is that vault 76 was supposed to be the first vault to open the people going were expecting to be the ones leaving the vault not thier kids or such
---
They had a party for it the night before, so it would seem likely.
---
I need to look at the update now. lol
---
thank you
---
"I wonder if they make power armor in my size" or something along those lines.
---
Allegedly they're fixed on the PTS. For the frame drops anyways, don't know if Ash and goo piles being unlootable are fixed. Or if they disappear after being looted.
---
So either you are not contributing or you are using a meta cheesing magic weapon. 
---
Wow. I’m so impressed!
---
Exploring and taking in the sights.
---
I get about 10 damage for 3 ranks of commando (It varies per gun but not by much) on my automatic handmade, in fact 5 ranks of adrenaline is about equal to all maxed ranks of damage perks for 4 points less. In the upcoming One Wasteland having just adrenaline should put you only a little bit behind min/maxing. Also the charisma legendary perk not counting towards sharing perks is a weird choice.
---
You feel better after telling mommy and daddy?
---
is there any issue with the pellet dispersion or how crits work in VATs? I'm assuming because Bethesda logic, that only one pellet would get a sneak modifier or crit damage, is that actually working for the full blast?
---
I like just wandering aimlessly, meet/help people that ask. At heart I'm a wanderer though. I'm almost lvl 60 and haven't even launched a nuke yet with ample chances too.
---
Uh just asking for backpack skins. Not that they would appear when using the said weapons.
---
I love that idea and have been wondering about it too. Even if they kept it to eight people, and had to use a smaller map, with no teams, just individuals fighting the environment and each other.. I think it would be a fantastic option.
---
yea.
---
That sounds cool. Been looking to replace Ace since he keeps saying he wants to burn my C.A.M.P. down.
---
Try to use a calculator to see why you're not doing any damage
---
I personally think that’s not a very good idea, I would prefer if this location was not in the actual game. Perhaps when you click on an item, it shows the armor or whatever on a platform you can spin around to look at what it looks like in game. A 3D model of the item that you can view from all angles.
---
Yeah yet you refuse to acknowledge Bethesda is essentially exploiting it's customer base. Weird. Keep focusing on only one part of what is said I guess. And there should be consequences. The consequence should not be an outright ban. But I'm not gonna argue with you, as you clearly have your mind set on how you feel. Immediately ban players for Bethesdas incompetence but let Bethesda rob players who are loyal and enjoy their games. Got it. Have a good one :)
---
Because I can repair my weapon at a bench or with one of the couple hundred improved repair kits I have and I’d rather have those 3 perk points somewhere else.
---
Yes the pts. I agree, they'll keep it broken in pvp.
---

---
I got 2,000 pump them all into the Legendary Run and then somehow the game gave me another 500. That's how I finished Legendary Run like two weeks ago.
---
Emergency protocols and the ridiculous damage resistance of T-65 is great. I'm damn near invulnerable to everything except poison. Earl's kicks and SBQ bite barely tickle.
---
Rifleman has terrible dps. It will never be good for boss fights.
---
When I did this I had about 25. I got through them one by one. It was a great victory.
---
I'll check it out. Thanks!
---
you might not be the right level
---
CALLED IT!
---
As ironic as it is, this makes me happy

---
It feels like every pellet hits in VATs.  And when not using it, perhaps there are too many server calculations?  Idk.  But you’ll see it when an enemies health rubber bands.  
---
Even without shotgun damage perks, 100% vats chance, or Instigating + Stealth damage is really useful.  
---
And this is all from a full health build. I don’t use junkies/bloodied
---
Players blowing through content is on them. People don't know how to take their time and enjoy things. I was doing just fine in my Fallout 1st private world. I didn't need a single other player or any sort of player economy. If the Challenge system didn't exist and we weren't hamstrung by cap limits, I'd never enter a public world. And let's be brutally honest. This game has gotten one quality expansion, Wastelanders. And that should have been how the game released. ESO style chapters would be nice. And after completing each one, I'd log off and never come back until the next one released. The stuff we have now is just the cheapest and easiest stuff they can deliver us. Hell, the RNG weapon garbage attached to the flying slot machine was imported from Fallout 4.
---
It is baffling that people still don’t understand how the event works. I always join if there’s other players at the event but nobody is ever filling the damn troughs.
---
Making it a public event was a mistake. You need a coordinated group to get the best rewards so it should be manually triggered like Encryptid.
---
Appreciate it
---
Literally all we log on to do.
---
Add me: ign InTheHutt and I'd be happy to help you out.
---
My point exactly, 'when on a team' not 'teammates give x amount of XP' and the person who commented even corrected themself. Plus I've tested it in game and XP numbers don't change
---
Yeah, which I don't really mind. PVP is better when it's all free-aim, although there are still some very powerful weapons you can vats with. I was just curious since they addressed it as broken and unintentional quite a while ago, I was hoping they would have at least mentioned it again.
---
I have everything but the stupid helmet which is the only thing I want from ACP. I will be running them till I get one then I will probably go back to nuking the queen or Morgantown.
---
The Sims: Fallout
---
There is an item that looks like a nuka cola machine and works as a display?
---
And you can put nuka behind the little door?
---
Is that what I'm being told?
---
Power armor is also worse than stealth armor for radiation. Which is still something that makes me scratch my head.
---
You forgot "Antisocial" since you have only 1 charisma and cannot share perk cards =)
---
85?
---
Actually I didn't test that, that's a good idea. Thank you will try it out.
---
Secret service is definitely best overall. The ballistic and energy resistance is high and the radiation resistance is really good too. Takes a bit to get a perfect set since it requires legendary modules + RNG of course.
---
I have seen a cat. I tamed him. They are only level 1 tho. My cat never made it back to camp but that’s ok. I love my deathclaw
---
Agreed, and a few other wish list items I've had regarding weapon appearance:
---
1. You should be able to disassociate weapon mods from what the gun visually looks like. I understand the game balance argument for trading ammo capacity for armor piercing, but the Handmade Rifle AKA AK-47 just doesn't look right without a big ole banana mag.  There are lots of examples of this, where the best looking mods aren't necessarily the most desirable performance-wise.  Bethesda could make it work like the item renaming system, where it reverts to default when dropped/traded/sold.
---
2. You should be able to change the color/hue of individual parts of a gun.  Kind of like how you can change the paint on different pieces of armor, but give me a full color wheel.
---
&gt;flawless ultrazite gatling
---
Wasit spelled like that? Not sure what a flawless is so im assuming its spelled wrong.
---
Ultracite gatling lasers are built in the weapon woekbench under heavy weapons (i think) you could have picked up an ammo conversion as theyare all ultracite or you could have just picked up a mod plan for it.
---
i read it somewhere, but cant find it anymore.. anyone could help out here ?
---
Some people like to live in Power Armor I guess. I just have the Stealth Suit hotkeyed so if I wander in to a Nuke Zone I'm not melted
---
Other players can only kill your animal with explosive meat or being in pvp. Those are the only two conditions atm
---
🤣
---
Awesome man!!
---
How does this not have more upvotes? 🤣😂🤣
---
I need fasnact bot singing to me
---
If that's true scorchbeast would be the only 3 star!!!
---
For me, I still plan on aiming for the challenges each day. I enjoyed it, but I can totally understand people that didn't.
---
However, for me, I will now not touch the Nuclear Winter ones at all, except maybe some of the super easy ones (place 3 CAMPS for example). I never touched NW before Season 1, and only played NW because "the numbers" were telling me it was going to be difficult if not impossible to complete without them. NW was my grind, and I am glad to be free of it this season.
---
I made the mistake of reading a little of his post history. Yikes. Blocked.
---
Yea i wont claim that crap. Nobody wants it. The push of these commie items is unreal. I dont mind a few items but seriously theres soooo many items not even just the season 2. The atom shop gets tons of it while people have been asking for bos  and enclave items since release... We have gotten very few to none of the items we have been asking for. I honestly think either bethesdas on some weird communist agenda or they sucking china off for cash. Either way this season 2 is GARBAGE with only a few cool items. Honestly imo not worth the time or effort. If you want me to play your game Bethesda commie season pass and nerfs arn't going to help. If you do enjoy the game by all means go ahead and do what makes you happy.
---
Try linking your Bethesda launcher to steam and see if that works.
---
i enjoy helping other people enjoy themselves
---
That's true, it looks more like an RPK but if we had a barrel mod similar to the RPK it would make sense.
---
Definitely, almost like how on BFV you can change the style of each individual part
---
D'oh!
---
No problem. Just saw it myself. Trying to figure out how I will buff my build.
---
👍
---
There's a clean nuka cola machine (atomic shoo), like the game's base nuka cola machine for camps, that works like the punch bowl (also atomic shop). Not to be confused with the nuka cola machine door (also atomic shop) which has all the usefulness (none) of the game's base nuka cola machine for camps, just also a door.
---
I'm happy to claim and earn more communist rewards in game.
---
at level 100 you have around 150 legendary perk points while all special slots are equipped,
---
plus new challenge gives another 50 legendary perk points at level 50,
---
legendary run provides 104 legendary perk points, and we're almost at season 2 now, so up to 208 from legendary runs,
---
if you need 1800 legendary perk coins to level up all 6 legendary cards,
---
1800 - 150 - 50 - 104 - 104 = 1442 points needed, 1396 / 18 * 5 = level 389 (if rounded up and accounted for averaging around 5 levels for 18 points)
---
This has to be a console only problem. I've never once had someone try to initiate a trade with me on pc nor have I ever heard anyone in vc begging for weapons or armor.
---
You math doesn't add up.
---
You get one each level and 4 additional each 5.
---
And since the animated cards don't count for anything anymore, and it doesn't matter if the cards are leveled or not, it's not 104 but only 13 point.
---
This.  I run it every time I see it. I am hoping to hit the jackpot and get a rare outfit.  The legendary I find the closest level 10 or under player and drop the 3 one stars, some stimpacks, water and faraway off as gifts.
---
It won’t matter if you get the plans. Bethesda thinks it s a great idea to hand out a Stalkers faster swing weightless Bear Arm
---
To people who do the Colossal Problem. It won’t matter if you unlock it cause they will just make you work for a shit one.
---
Do you have any armor pieces with AP regen? I’m interested in dropping action boy and using Dodgy
---
Gauss Shotgun yes, other shotguns with good legend rolls are capable for things that aren't boss type enemies. 
---
But the Gauss Shotgun straight up fucks. Depending on what build you run a one star with bloodied, junkies, furious or instagating will 1-2 shot almost anything with a charged shot. It also has access to perforating magazine, built in explosive rounds, and a very good range and accuracy. Easily my favorite weapon.
---
What can I say, those are all the thing I added and I don't have the shakes.
---
Nope, not anymore under normal circumstances.
---
Hey guys, keeper of the PS4 side here. Please don't be afraid to send a message if you'd like to visit, I'm getting people following me (I can only assume it's because of this) but not many messages. :)
---
What you don't account for is that many people switch out perk cards and most importantly people swap special points.  I did a major swap a while a go, so all that is down the drain.  Also 400 is still a lot.
---
Like i said if you enjoy it go for it. Im just stating my opinion. You do what makes you happy. As long as your not hurting anyone of course.
---
Your wording is ~~really confusing~~ *poor* then.
---
It's not a display item.
---
Edit because OP is full of snark
---
A colossal problem is easily the best screw farm in game. Just run around tagging all the wendigo mobs and loot. 
---
Even with a low level it is worth a try. 
---
Do you know about tagging components? Look at you junk screen in pipboy, switch to component view, tag components you need. Makes it easy to find the junk you want.
---
No need to make that bait info easy to find. Under normal circumstances pets can't be hurt when shot at.
---
I run around with an ie and qe pumpshotty to fix the reload I use the firework mine glitch to reload **faster**
---
Looks more like a burned German soldier from WW1.
---
have you toggled craftable? you may need a perk card like science
---
The more who know the sooner the fix
---
Don’t forget White knight for armor repairs.
---
I know the feeling, I’ve taken a 2 week break
---
leveled cards provide points "cards spent on perk card * 2", I checked that on PTS this is unchanged from day it was introduced.
---
13 perk card packs * 4 cards each = 52 cards * 2 legendary perk points each = 104 legendary perk points
---
18 perk points for every 5 levels
---
104 legendary perk points / 18 legendary perk points per 5 levels * 5 levels = ~29 levels
---
Each perk pack gives 5 cards correct? That would make it 10 coins per pack. Since each card is worth 2 points.
---
So 13 packs would be 130 coins.
---
Hmmm! Not a bad idea!
---
You didn't miss anything. OP is ~~just bad at words.~~ *really articulate*
---
Yeah you’re right on those
---
That I cannot account for, they can find this for themselves since each swap is 2 legendary perk points, I'm just providing the baseline
---
I meant 400 and no I’m not using a magic and I’m soloing him I’m using a stealth commando vats build with a b2525 fixer
---
Will not show up until you leave the game close the app and restart
---
4 cards and a bubblegum with awesome and terrible joke
---
Ammo/smelting
---
I agree. The workshops **clearly** say that you are opening yourself up to pvp. And for the most part it's manageable. I even said so in my post, all be it with a single sentence.  What my issue is that I was taken down by someone literally 20 times my level.
---
I don't care that other players may want to kill me. It is part of the game.
---
 But I would like at least some semblance of a chance. That's the only reason I would propose the level splitting.   
---
It's just a suggestion that would address what some of my friends feel is a very large downfall of the game.
---
I will say I've been one shot killed by high level players with out taking workshops and not being in the area of a workshop. I was a very low level at the time, so even with the dampening of the damage it killed me. lol  
---
I must have accidentally killed his target or walked in front of his sniper shot cause I didn't even see him there. All I know is I got a  "player is now wanted do you want revenge " type message when I died. lol I was so confused. xD
---
Oh I know it looks so dumb in power armor lol
---
Totally agree NW and camp building were my grind, I like my camp the way it is, and having to knock bits down to build crap did my head in.  
---
I know you could do it in workshops, but PvPers would jump on workshops all the time, so it was either put up with the PvP or do it in your own camp, I eventually worked out a way of mitigating PvPers in workshops, so that became easier.
---
His math is right.
---
They're in the places other people mentioned, but unique instances. You can't walk in and find someone in there doing an op.
---
Is it only 4 cards? Thought it was 5 haha. Shows how much I pay attention
---
White knight and Serendipity don't work in power armor, ditch them. Blocker is an excellent perk for bloodied build, I'd replace full charge with it. Replace serendipity with Good With Salt, and take Carnivore, Scaly Skin, Bird Bones, Egg Head, and Eagle Eyes mutations. Radicool will easily give you back the points in strength you lose to mutations, with a point or two extra.
---
I would highly recommend taking a perk that reduces ammo weight. For Gauss Minigun, this would be Batteries included (which will also greatly reduce fusion core weight too, since you use power armor) and still counts as an explosive weapon for demolitionist. Ditch the Power Patcher and Power User perks, you don't need them.
---
Ah nice one I got rid of mine and still can’t find the forest one
---
Commenting so I can find this post later. I'd be interested in seeing what I have left to get after playing since beta
---
Also the number you're looking for is 3.6 points/level.  (1 card x 5 levels + 4/5 levels) = 9/5 levels = 1.8 cards per level = 3.6 points per level.
---
Sorry lol You can put beverages in the pristine nuka cola machine and someone can come around and grab one, but they aren't actually on display like a display case does. The base game nuka cola machine can't do that at all tho. You can only open and close the door on the machine. Then there's a nuka cola machine door that works as a door in a door frame and only functions as a door. You can put a pristine nuka cola machine behind a nuka cola machine door.
---
Of course!
---
What a shitstorm.
---
It looked the same to me. I did both the daily ops there and just explored it in adventure.
---
That is a great way to get anyone to work harder .. Its not that easy to fix bugs in software that is this large. They didn't even have past experience with  this and have admitted it. I think for what it is the game is great. Everyone wants the bugs fixed me included and you know what Bethesda does too. For the fast travel bug I think I saw its because it thinks you are taking damage from radiation. Bloody build? I for one in all the time I have been playing have never had the fast travel bug but I don't play bloody its to easy. One sec need to equip Fireproof ok fire away.
---
I never got anything but trash from Fascnacht. I just assumed it rewarded from a lesser pool of rolls
---
If you are up on a roof, the AI sends them to run away... just like it does in the rest of the world.   This seems to overcome the event goal of destroying the meditation hubs

Please send a chat or message if you want to see the xbox mule. It's the easiest way for me to track everyone.  Thanks!

&gt; Players blowing through content is on them. People don't know how to take their time and enjoy things
---
You can’t tell people how to enjoy things, you also can’t assume that they don’t take the time but still get through all the content quickly, especially with everything going on.  If you can’t go out and do anything else during a weekend, might as well play a video game. 
---
&gt; I was doing just fine in my Fallout 1st private world. I didn't need a single other player or any sort of player economy. If the Challenge system didn't exist and we weren't hamstrung by cap limits, I'd never enter a public world.
---
You’re playing a multiplayer game as if it was a single player.  That’s great, but it was designed to be a multiplayer survival game with PVP mixed in, and just because you *can* play it that way, doesn’t mean that the design choices are wrong. 
---
&gt; This game has gotten one quality expansion, Wastelanders. And that should have been how the game released. ESO style chapters would be nice. And after completing each one, I'd log off and never come back until the next one released.
---
I actually hate wastelanders, it goes against what this game was supposed to be about. It was supposed to be a survival-lite game with PVP elements, where we can build our own camps, cook food, etc.  It was supposed to be more like other survival games, with looter/shooter design mixed in, along with a story, but no Humans.
---
 
---
&gt; And after completing each one, I'd log off and never come back until the next one released. The stuff we have now is just the cheapest and easiest stuff they can deliver us. Hell, the RNG weapon garbage attached to the flying slot machine was imported from Fallout 4.
---
Then don’t play games as a service games.  If the games design goes against what you want to play, don’t act like the overbearing boyfriend/girlfriend who thinks “You can change them” because you’r just going to make everybody miserable. 
---
Basically stay in your lane, if you prefer non-RNG games then don’t pick up an online game as a service game and then bitch to try to get them to change it.  Just don’t buy it in the first place.
---
Yeah I’ll stick to my 25%xp cranberry relish
---
Backpacks don’t show up or function while in power armor to begin with.
---
Sounds pretty cool, I'm about a month into the game and have quite a few but I could surely use a lot more. Do we have the option to trade with users??
---
You'd have to try an ungodly amount or have really amazing RNG. I probably did close to 100+ events before I got the helmet from Protest March and the outfit from Fertile Soil. Doing it a single time is hell, I can't imagine who would have the patience of a saint to acquire more than 1 set.
---
Valuable time? It’s a video game that you play for fun and entertainment, when you have the time. 
---
Seriously the way so many of you talk about play video games. I laugh every time someone talks about it being hard work. Right because you’re pushing buttons while it’s always 72 degrees and Snacky in your comfy game seat.
---
Also no one is talking about spending hours just wandering around. If you are just focusing on events when your playing then yeah, walk to West Tek or Whitesprings on a route you haven’t taken. 
---
Seriously you can find things you didn’t know, have some awesome encounters. I’ve gotten into so many crazy 2-3 way battles. 
---
Your words give me a picture of how you play. It seems focused on grinding gear and currency to get better stuff to easier kill everything.
---
That to me is boring.
---
This is horrible news.  People have built entire characters around that.
---
and you didn't even take a screenshot to show us ;-;
---
The engineers outfit has a tank on the back that would complete the flamer style
---
The only thing I seen is when I kill one too soon they freeze up and drop no loot
---
Looking at you stairs in the burrows.
---
I actually did but reddit only allows links and not pictures. So I would have to upload the photo to somewhere. Which I could try somewhere I suppose
---
They’ve all got the Anki right on the gun now, they would either have to change the entire model, or it would be completely useless
---
who is downvoting our respect?
---
I never knew that.
---
I never needed to either but it is always cool to learn new things.
---
Use of the the many mailboxes in the game would be great. And some wastelanders should fix the bank. So we can have an account bank. A daily hunting down some robbers/wealthy ppl, event to protect/rob caravan or whatever.  edit; aha lol, checked it up. I so misunderstood.
---
The PTS is Beth launcher only.

---
Tesla and magic plasma...
---
I believe you're referring to the Responders Fireman outfit and helmet. They have a painfully low drop chance and can come from forest events and toxic valley events. I got the helmet from Protest March in Grafton and the outfit from Fertile Soil at the vault-tec aggri centre. 
---
There's also apparently a chance it'll drop from 1 of the low level quests in Flatwoods when you first start, but I haven't run a new character in a very long time so I'm not sure they still exist post-wastelanders, what with changes like the Wayward and what not.
---
Its the world thats brokened
---
400 levels, in a long run? Not if you're playing around a year regularly, for power levelers 400 levels seems like a few months time tops from what I've seen people doing.
---
Jesus God! That is both horrifying and hysterical....I need to go accost my husband with this image!
---
I did it solo :/ got nothing the whole time, pretty lame haha
---
I use that too when I can but it has a spoil and you need to get the ingredients and stuff. It's just good to have extra on the side
---
Just use imgur. For the record I wasn't trying to be an asshole, just thought it'd be cool to see this airship camp c:
---
argh! fuck!
---
I overlooked the word "pack" in your OP :/
---
Sorry, with packs you are right.
---
Gun bash
---
Lol no I got ya. I didn’t think you were being an asshole
---
Agreed, not a huge issue compared to some other things out there haha
---
Furious explosive combat rifle
---
Don't worry, it took me a while to calculate it all after long week of work, I kept ending up with a number in calculator and wondering what that number represents, ended up just writing every step xD
---
I do not.  My herbivore toons are my heavy PA toons.  So I use rank3 thruhiker instead of action boy/girl so I use the corn soup to gain my AP back.
---
Now it shows 5000 atoms.
---
Fallout 1st is still not connecting.
---
Still getting  Disconnected from server.
---
Are you using a bloodied build? Serendipity has saved me from falls before, but it doesn't prevent crippled limbs for some odd reason.
---
Paw Patrol HQ is the Landview Lighthouse
---
The only thing about Santa is that he is the most annoying of them all
---
Maybe you ended up in the instance by yourself?
---
I never said valuable time and I never said anything implying it's hard work. Grinding and hoping you hit good rng isnt implying it's hard work. A lot of assumptions you're making there lol. I don't even have a "game seat", I play just sitting on my bed when I have time to play 😂 it's fine that you find a certain way to play boring, that doesn't at all dictate how other people should play. And as I said, I spend time exploring the world, and have found interesting events and cool items from doing so. But I'm not going to walk back and forth to every single event, location, or workshop. That's fine if you want to do that and you have time to do that, but no t everyone spends that much time playing to where we want to walk back and forth to every event or location we go to. Your words definitely make you seem like a high and mighty guy who knows better than everyone else and makes you seem like you think everyone should play how you do. That to me is not the point in a video game lol. Me choosing to fast travel in some cases doesn't mean I or others "fast travel too much". Even if someone literally fast travels everywhere, it's a feature added to the game for them to use at will, and if they want to they can as they please. I'm glad I don't have your mindset lol
---
As long as power creeps stop killing bosses in 10 seconds and everyone else can at least get rewards I am fine with that.
---
I'd be rocking the flamer tanks on my back, even when not using my flamer.

I got soo hammered, I didn't wake up for months and don't remember what happened at the party.

He was waiting for the “I think your math wrong “ he had that set up in the back pocket for sure lol

so meh for ppl w/o 1st then.

Jajajaj, but I don’t really miss my cork, I don’t think I really use it for anything
---
I think the only way you could switch between Steam and Bethesda's Launcher is if you linked your Bethesda Account to your Steam account prior to it being available on Steam. I briefly played on Steam after it was launched on that platform, but as I lost my 1st Membership when I did that I quickly went back to the launcher.
---
Download the launcher, link your Bethesda account to your steam account and see what happens.
---
You paid for a game that wasn’t want you like.  The game was advertised as being:
---
* Survival lite
---
* Looter Shooter
---
* PVP Elements
---
* No NPCs
---
* Players create drama
---
That’s what it was advertised as being, if you don’t like games like that, why the hell would you spend money on a game like that?  You buy the game, knowing full well what it was, and then complain that it’s what it is.  
---
A fool and his money are soon parted.

Is that the correct amount?
---
The plasma caster had one as well, if I remember correctly. The only issue is, these weapons have been redesigned so they don’t need backpacks anymore, so it would just be an ammo backpack that isn’t connected to any weapon, which I think would just look strange.
---
Gauss Pistol, Gamma Gun, Plasma Flamer is my favorite gunslinger combo.
---
Thanks mate ^^ I use a 45er  rifle and a superhammer aß Main weapons and for the Tough stuff Ive got a gatling laser 👍
---
Wait that’s not the case already? That’s a bummer
---
bro....
---
Naturally stumbling upon players or their camps
---
I'm displaying power armor like its a bouncer to my base.
---
You gotta love that rolling pin! I recently maxed out my scrip and decided to roll some weapons with mmrgh. A hatchet, a set of brass knuckles, and a switchblade. I tried armor and got 2 wooden pieces out of my first 3.
---
Mmurgh's display is bullshit. I see power armor helmets and heavy weapons galore. But what I get is trash.
---
If we got sandbags and some paper targets, I could remake the Metro 2033 shooting range with Marine armor on the mannequins.
---
Don’t down vote, you may hate him but it’s a legit answer.
---
I carry one rad ant lager for this type of issue. It gives you a big carry weight bonus for two minutes. Just enough time to fast travel back to camp and dump some stuff.
---
Gosh you're thick, yes you can. That is how the perk card superduper works, if you're lucky enough.
---
Ammo Backpacks would be cool for increased ammo capacity and weight reduction for that certain ammo type.
---
So the collectron for the group that covets advanced technology actually just picks up the most plentiful and worthless junk it can find? I guess that's pretty fitting. At least he will make a nice decoration to have something different pointlessly wandering my camp.
---
It’s fun!
---
My latest character is an explosive shotty build..just because!
---
With a few pieces of AP refresh Armour along with food buffs I can pretty much VATS/ Gun Fu ad infinitum
---
If you have claim tokens go and try to get the Fancy Shotgun, I played with that and it’s what got me to fall in love with shotties
---
My advice would be go for it  it’s not much of a problem to go heavy gunner if you don’t like it
---
For real
---
Get yourself a quad explosive double barrel, laugh at everything as you shred your path through the wasteland.
---
Recoil is fine because it’s an smg
---
I believe he also collects alcohol and grenades as well, but don’t quote me on that since my info was from before it’s release, so I may be wrong.
---
With so many new people around I put away my shotgun and try to stay out of it as much as possible and just help
---
The postmaster is basically a lost item retrieval
---
No announcement has been made yet.
---
I had around 2700 in my account before the glitch.
---
Oh they still do!  I just found that spot about a week or two ago (I just started playing about 1.5 months ago) and can't describe the look of joy on my face when I set the first one off.  LOL
---
Real life minutes. The timer doesn't reset when you quit the game though so that's nice.
---
You might need to rank up Survival Shortcut if you want to maintain Well Fed and Well Hydrated indefinitely, but it should be fine to just pop one off before hard events or Daily Ops. I also started drinking from the well in my camp and eating whatever's lying around once I got the perk in the PTS.
---
Halloween?
---
Yeah. It’s about inertia. Not height from the ground. Like irl.
---
No one runs brawling?
---
Yeah, that's how it works. But as OP and Betheada also claimed, making a profit off a crafting/scrapping loop to gain resources is not intentional.
---
Awesome ! Been waiting on leveling an alt due to this. Thanks !
---
Mischief Night
---
Once you buy any collectron, all other collectrons will gain that option in the terminal. So if you purchase the Scavatron you could even make your Communist look for junk
---
Visual appearance
---
My main's C.A.M.P.
---
There isn't a better one.
---
Alright man, gotcha
---
One of them supports freedom.
---
Haha, lol
---
Thank you very much.
---
What a laboriously simple concept you’ve explained.
---
My argument is not in *what* capacity it exists, rather that it *shouldn’t* exist.
---
Ahh so it's happened before? Or did you just earn atoms via progress? Are you a new player?
---
The other collects junk you collected for the BoS.
---
Stick some lead champagne in it. That faster fall speed is massively annoying
---
1. It collects cloth, Cork, glass, everything we have donated for the event.
---
2. No explosive build functions well. Explosives are garbage in this game.
---
Then they ain’t your real friends then
---
Yo, can you confirm that we can change the BoS collection setting too? Cause all I get is ad victorian brother from the terminal...
---
The Atomic shop always confuses me with it's choices of skins, example the bow. I believe there's been at least 3 skins for that thing. 2 of them being free unlockable ones.. (Which look awesome btw, but it's a weapon I hardly if ever see anyone use..) 
---
Feel like such wasted potential, honestly.. Honestly.. I don't know why Bestheda doesn't just ask the community what guns they want to have skins for (ones of course that don't already have any) and have a list with each listed potential weapon. With the possibility of it being voted for and then having a skin made for it. Hell I'd be down for buy a skin, if it was an awesome one.
---
Not to mention there's loads of just potential skins that could be used, at least I feel like.. What about a blood covered LMG? (There's already a skin of the Combat Armour like thaaaat, just sayin') 
---
Or even more faction ones, I meaaan. Do we REAAALLY need another Handmade skin? I don't have a problem with it. Cool gun, but I don't use the thing. Expect for NV. I already like the skin I have for it. Thaaat free one, from this season. 
---
I'm just reaaaaally hoping Bestheda adds more skins or just paints to guns. At least do it for guns not already with skins...
---
Show me where Bethesda has stated that using Super Duper while crafting is considered an exploit, or that the ability in circumstances that only use the game functions as intentionally designed that can generate additional resources is not intentional. 
---
The crafting requirements for the item are set by Bethesda. 
---
The scrapping yield for the item is set by Bethesda. 
---
The functionality of the Super Duper Perk is set by Bethesda. 
---
There is no exploit involved when someone crafts an item. There is no exploit involved when someone scraps an item. There is no exploit involved when someone equips a perk.
---
It's in the backpack.
---
I'm sure they'll sell you the same model as a plush in a few weeks.
---
Hrmmm my camp does involve some platforming to make it down to the vendors safely,  could be a hilarious way to trick some people up.
---
The gauss Shotgun and stealth builds are both strong enough on their own. We don't need NPCs being blind on top of already being killed by a weapon that can one shot pretty much everything without sneak bonuses. 
---
The Gauss Shotguns immense murder power comes at the cost of not being a good stealth weapon.
---
Ok.i see we have that tin foil hat.whats around the mouth a dr.mask?also where do I get these glasses!
---
no only events can drop fixers and bullion weapons, only purveyor and events drop fixers
---
Got my Gauss a few days ago, it's great. Do you get any weird issues with it though? I find sometimes I'll be 95% in vats and miss 4-5 times in a row. Also the damage can be a little weird, one shots almost anything but sometimes seems to bizarrely do very little to an enemy pretty sporadically. I really love the gun but it feels odd to me sometimes.
---
Save me the cliche lines. Me ad my money are fine. I'm nearing 50 and I haven't needed to lift a finger to work for over 20 years. I and others like me complain because we're Fallout fans, and we don't like the tripe you like. And the fact that you don't like Wastelanders shows that. And we're going to keep voicing our opinions until the devs remember that this is a Fallout game and not Rust or the Division.
---
Pretty sure it's meant to parody cold war propaganda
---
I got a 3* Nocturnal Baton 
---
Turns out , it is not 100% bad because it has Attack speed , so i use it against low level critters, does a decent job
---
You should know, you work at Artkos
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Z8aZWK1CISDkxWAcwQhw8/fallout-76-update-21-patch-notes-august-4-2020
---
&gt; Exploit: Fixed an exploit related to scrapping Assaultron Helmets.
---
Context: *Player was able to use this same trick to gain a net profit of screws, circuity from bonus Assaultron Helmet, which scraps into an Assaultron Head*
---
A large majority of crafting/scrapping recipes, like the Helmet, were unchanged when copied from Fallout 4, where Super Duper did not exist.
---
Anything that produces a similar loop is a bug.
---
Just swap to mine site kittery or elaine when the event isnt going power armor glitch in loot both server hop rinse and repeat .
---
ps if you server hop more then 1 time hope you got lots of acid to breakdown the ore
---
I know, but don’t worry I won’t tell anyone about your nasty encounter with the nuka cola machine.
---
With like 90% of Atom Shop items having some glaring flaw they'd stop selling if we could actually see it before hand.
---
Very meh especially for people with 1st I'd say.
---
I have tons of mats in 1st stash, it's pointless.
---
Proletariat all the way. Gives you (nearly) enough purified water (and meds) to dilute things without making your camp look shit with purifiers. And the random food here and there is quite nice. Especially for herbivores.
---
That's shotguns and vats with charge weapons in general. When you have the 95% hit chance and miss multiple times, you have to cancel and renter vats. I personally don't use Vats with it that much and the little damage part is because the gauss Shotgun behaves a little differently. Unlike the other shotguns where each pellet does identical damage. The Gauss Shotgun has the damage seems to randomly split between the entire shot. So sometimes you might miss with the big damage pellets and only hit with the low damage.
---
I don't know why it does that, that's only from my observations with using it. If you ADS and hit them with the whole blast (which is pretty consistent since the accuracy with the short scope and extended barrel is very good) it usually always kills.
---
Considering they had support tickets for the canvas bags going to everyone, I'm not surprised.
---
You may have just got a receiver/mod plan if you aren't seeing a weapon you can craft.
---
At this point anything goes...stop sign
---
I mean... I guess that would be a way to do it.
---
I'm sorry my wording confused you on a completely seperate reply, but being bitter about it is just childish. Especially since it's completely unrelated to the this specific thread of my original post. 
---
Let's recap:
---
My reply to you wasn't even that hard to follow. I understood that a bunch of parentheses might have made it kind of confusing. You started by pulling something you misunderstood from someone else's comment and you couldn't follow their comment to begin with. So, I just corrected myself since you were obviously struggling. Then you continued to get upset over it by dragging unrelated people into it when you haven't been able to follow anyone's conversation in this entire thread. Have a great day ✌
---
BoS shoots a ton of stuff on sight. I wouldn't be surprised if they were a quasi hostile faction when they show up. They've never been super welcoming.
---
The first Elder Maxon was dedicated to helping people, but based on what we've heard so far, the rest of the Brotherhood officers don't feel the same way.
---
Yet another reason for us not to welcome their arrival in Appalachia. 
---
This will be an opportunity for the Appalachian Enclave to shine.
---
a mixed set of creature-specific pieces (zealot's, mutant, ghoul slayer's, etc.) is arguably the best, defense-wise.
---
but if you want to prioritize sneak, a full chameleon set makes you 100% undetectable except for turrets. so long you don't move, of course.
---
SS may also not the best choice for sneak because it doesn't have a shadowed option.
---
I did both concurrently and it was...confusing.  I'd finish interacting with her on one quest, and then see another notification to "speak with Rose" and I'd be like, "what? I already did."  I was very happy to finish both of those.
---
No I bought $20 worth of items to buy something bought it and then went to bed and woke up with way more than I thought. I'll be honest with you I was a little high when I made the purchase so I thought shit maybe i double dipped. Check my bank account and everything was fine. Steam says I have a 1000 hours so I'm definitely not new
---
I finally completed the wastelanders story after getting heavily into this game, is the t-65 worth it? I want it but t-51 with nuka skin is the best
---
There is a pipe out back which has a door/opening that leads to the area.  I feel like there’s a keycard you need for another door later in the pipes but can’t remember for sure.
---
Absolutely - it's the Fallout equivalent of GI Joe.
---
I've had good luck with Vanguard's, Sentinel works pretty well with it (I have several Vanguard Sentinel pieces I run with)
---
AP refresh is good, though I'm commando, you might want to look at something with better sneak to add in.  I'm a fan of adding 1 piece of Chameleon, though more pieces does make it better...but at that point you're taking from 1 effect to add to another.
---
Vanguard helps stop you from getting low, Bolstering helps you once you get there.  I prefer to front stack my protection personally.
---
You cant find it you'll have to scrap a TON of black powder rifles to get it
---
Since I only have one, that is good to know!  
---
Yeah I always use vats with shotguns because I find that they're absolutely useless without the help of magic effects. Maybe I need to break out the habit with the Gauss but I find without vats the spread is way too wide.
---
I haven't done it yet because I'm only lvl 80-90 not op or any special build and I've seen a lot of hate towards the Tesla rifle being used during it and it's probably my best weapon. I'm also on ps4 but maybe I'll join one after like 20 more levels
---
That’s a pretty good point... I just remembered the BOS in New Vegas that puts an explosive collar on us and tells us to deal with a ranger nearby.
---
Enclave is even worse. Don't need to support a bunch of fascists in power armor.
---
Won't level 200 get you 5 slots?  Last I saw it was at 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300.  I'm pushing to get to 200 before the 15th too...
---
Sorry for no clarification, I meant the legendary secondary gun perk. I wanted to make this build because I recently acquired a BE250 LMG.
---
Thank you for your other advice though.
---
i can see it as the two opposing factions where raiders are capitalist and foundation is communist, only saving grace for foundations story line has got to be the choice to just axe that spy and brainwash her daughter to be American (whats a female Chad called like a Betty or some shit?(betty page?))
---
not cool with that being all my money can be worth though, if i was running atomic shop design id be calling for all sorts of unique faction outfits that come in color variation like the fasnacht masks, so when we are sold a non communist outfit, well know that if we see an npc wearing it, itll be a different color at least!(caravan trader outfit, the quack outfit, etc.) you can just straight up buy meg’s outfit, or you could, and like, not even a second colorway, like instead of black give us black purple dark blue dark red, i mean, if it wasnt an online game id be like fine, but its an online game so even if the files are on our consoles whether we want them or not, do less commie stuff idk its getting weird. leave whatevers up, up, for roleplayers but give us some middle ground between liberty prime and plain ole americams, the patriotic combat armor paints were great, give us more west virginia based skins even, id rather that than just a sea of red armor skins, and like, incorporate the meta in more, itll save on rehashing dumb commie stuff, like, talon company skins? stuff like that like, posters of locations like the capital wasteland or the commonwealth or bar harbor or like stuff like that, even like cit posters, not everybody went to VTU, right? like the grafton high bed the mascots the poster stuff, thats the right use of red lol, give us less but more, variants of outfits dont have to be limited to color but in small aesthetic twinges that are worth the space they take up, rather than being a dice roll for a week or two before it’s ‘vaulting’ away again for low performance!? (rando rant.)
---
You have to scrap the mod or black powder rifles that have the mod equiped. 
---
Only thing in the game that is that way.
---
Trying to find where to get the mod
---
Chameleon can be good, you only need one piece for the effect to work, be aware that if fighting a boss enemy then you lose sneak effect.
---
Other than that I would still go either full unyielding with a few points into defensive perks or a mix of bolstering/unyielding. 
---
Don't fall into the trap of vanguards, its terrible. Simple way to look at it is when you get mobbed by 5+ enemies and start taking damage do you want your damage resistance to get higher or lower?
---
We take the world as it is, not as some fairy tale.
---
I use raider for the ammo myself. id love to have the BOS bot but using raider settings. but seems im still stuck with raider.
---
Thank you, I appreciate the advice and guidance.
---
I see, maybe I gonna go for full chameleon then. Which will be the bed alternative to SS?
---
Nice, a couple of mine I can server hop for and am just tired of doing it.  3 are Scorched Earth drops, 1 is another current event drop, 2 are Free Range that just have never dropped for me, 1 is an expired event, 1 is a rare Divide drop, and 3 are rare Forest drops.  So I guess that makes 13 I need.
---
Ah I heard that from someone else too, they said the first Maxon was more liken Lyons BOS, but then leaders down the line took over and kinda messed things up.
---
That's essentially what I got from this post lol
---
I'm OK with multiple toons per build. You are free to change your build up until you decide to double down on a type, at which point you have to choose a path via the legendary perk system. I guess I don't see the problem. It's unrealistic that you should be able to be anything at any time.
---
You have to scrap the black powder rifle to get the mod cause you cant find it in the open world
---
It does , my friend got one helmet first time he played 76, but he stopped playing and im trying to get him to download again to give it to me
---
It’s bullshit to keep you playing. For the most part none of it goes anywhere right now.
---
Have you unlocked other collectron models? And no, I have not logged in to collect my Brotherhood version yet. These observations were made only using the previous versions, if the behavior changed with this model I will test later.
---
Thats the BOS for you. Lyons were the odd ones.
---
Raider is great, non stop chems, booze, and guns.
---
Ah I see my bad.
---
If youre on Ps4 , i can give it to you
---
Well, they didn't have the easiest of times out West. There was conflict between the BOS and the NCR too.
---
This is the kind of awesomeness Bethesda had in mind when they created a multiplayer Fallout.  What a cool and unique service.
---
Every time I shake my head in disgust at all the toxic shit from assholes scamming people, destroying some noob's base, one-shotting legendaries in uranium fever on purpose, etc....
---
I see something like this that restores my faith in the community as a whole.
---
It's all good my guy
---
It was a freebie, you expected p2w?
---
I am still amazed people actually get collectrons for the shit they collect..
---
theyre all about the 1 liners IMO
---
Extended barrel and precise stock with short scope make it accurate at some pretty good ranges. You can use the Skeet Shooter perk and it gets very accurate, but it's not necessary imo. It doesn't need the magic effects to slaughter everything.
---
I have a bloodied 1 star Gauss Shotgun with no damage perks besides bloody mess. And an uncharged shot while I'm at half health can usually kill the Wendigo spawns in ACP. I'll sometimes use Vats with it but I can only get 2 shots since I have low agility and am always in Power Armor so no unyielding for me. And that's usually only when I have a Wendigo spawn do that thing where they attack me but end up going through me and they're a pain to aim at.
---
They both collect the same stuff...ammo or aid.
---
And trust me when I say if I had to listen to the Raider collectron for another second I was going to scrap the damn thing!
---
It's why we call em quacks in England, cos it made them look like a duck appernetly
---
Bethesda just gave us an event that guarantees you a three star legendary role (Colossal Problem). It’s like getting a random three star from purveyor. Seriously this is awesome, because now you don’t need to farm scrip as much to get a shot at your god role. You simply farm keycards and drop nukes all day long. Tons of EXP. Tons of screws. Tons of acid. Tons of stable flux. Your chances of getting something good eventually is not too bad, and when you do, trade it for something better on reddit FO76 marketplace. The whole “I started with a penny and worked my way to a signed baseball” story. Also, if you aren’t running some kind of Melee in this game you will be burning through resources like mad. As underrated as it is you can do way more damage with Melee than a ranged build could ever do. I hit Mr. Earl for 3.5K a pop with my Miner Gauntlet and I do just fine.
---
Are you guys finally waking up to the fact that the Brotherhood are the baddies?
---
I find your lack of faith to the **RNG gods** disturbing
---
Ive switched Ace to BoS and back again, seemed to work fine. PS4
---
Hey, what I do with my robots is none of your business. Ok? The world has ended. Lawlessness is rampant. I'm going to get mine, so you go get yours.
---
The BoS are dicks of the highest order. So many people think of them as the good guy heroes from Fallout 3 and that's a shame. The Outcasts there were more like the actual Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Uh they're both sort of fascist
---
Yes completely confused vanguard with bolstering, sorry language issues. Back to the question I like your point of view I will take in consideration
---
We have the finest technology and the sweetest digs you can imagine. If you want to keep your shanty towns and huts feel free.
---
You can just fire away without charging it. I only charge it up against bigger monsters like the SBQ and the Colossus Earl. Perhaps I am misusing it??🤓🤔
---
Santatron was reasonably useful in that it collected xmas gifts, food item needed for atom challenges, adn a few junk items.
---
This is awesome.
---
It'd be pretty awesome if the Brotherhood took over the silos and you had to fight Power Armored human enemies alongside the robot defenses to launch a nuke.
---
I have Cannibal as a shared perk and it makes me so happy when I see a teammate use it.
---
It's even better when it's accidental. :)
---
Oh damn that is a nice drop. I have a power armor heavy bloody build too its nice.
---
Cliche as it may be I absolutely love the Whitespring because I have so many great memories there.  The first time coming over a hill and seeing all this green in a sea of brown was like heaven.  The terror of going through the clubhouse for the first time when I didn't know better.  Finally making my way inside and having a chance to explore, and how much goes on there.  I built my first major base at the Whitespring when running the cottages was the best way to level and grind legendary items.  I know every inch of the grounds intimately, and love trying to see how fast I can shave time off of getting around.
---
You can do that. Go to the terminal and it'll let you change it to search for guns and ammo
---
If this were true you wouldn't get rewarded for foundation quests lol
---
Something BOS themed perhaps? Not wood scraps...
---
Random damage per pellet - that's the magic effect. You get that on any shotgun with the bugged effect - Junkie's, Instigating, Stalker's, 40% Bash damage, 50% limb damage, 33% VATS or a single armor piece with 15% reduced blocking damage 3rd star. You can one/two shot a lvl68 supermutant with no damage perks or damage stars (like a vampire 33% vats combat shotgun).
---
They'll fix it eventually, so enjoy while you can ;-)
---
anything with a shadowed option will work. leather, metal, robot, combat, scout. most balanced setup would be a combat chest, 2 metal and 2 leather limbs. all heavy.
---
Your friends are seriously missing out im so sorry
---
Tanagra Town!
---
I love the Mire &amp; it's such a cool landmark on the horizon. Plus it's somehow related to the Interloper/other eldritch powers. Why did the vines lift it up? Think it's the epicenter of, well, something.
---
I don't think they can spawn in world anymore. Scrapping the mod box does not work. Scrapping black powder rifles also does not work, as the black powder rifle does not have any mods anymore with Wastelanders. Preexisting mod boxes can still be applied, but do not scrap them, as I used a bug to make copies of the mod box itself to scrap, and got nothing Same goes for non-legendary bayoneted bp rifles.
---
Love. Your. Junk.
---
Just leveled two of them and no problem at all.
---
not on the BOS one, its set on just what OP said.
---
I was actually a big fan of the Brotherhood in Fallout 3, Less so in New Vegas... and that little twat Maxon in Fallout 4 pretty much turned me against the whole concept of the BOS. (Didn’t like their whole “genocide” thing that had going... Definitely wasn’t a fan of them trying to kill loyal Danse, stealing crops from settlements and opening fire on wastelanders.)
---
Yeah I have a 1* junkies and 1* instigating, both primed for easier ammo crafting cost. I use extended barrel and precise stock. When it works it works very well and generally one shots the lot, but I have everything specced, shotgun perks, skeet shooter, full demo expert. Really is an amazing gun and worth the rep grind, just wish it didn't have the weird vats issue, but then I guess it's similar to the Gauss rifle in that regard.
---
chameleon stacks and you need a full set to get the most out of it. you don't 'lose sneak' when fighting bosses, what happens is that your critical multiplier won't trigger if your target (boss or otherwise) is in combat with anything else, player or mob.
---
You're really invested in this. I'm not upset. You're upset and you're projecting.
---
Insulting my reading comprehension isn't going to play out how you think it is.
---
And this: ✌️is you dismissing whatever reply I may have before I can even articulate one. That's childish.
---
Also, this post is only getting upvotes because people think that you're talking about something that they don't know about. You're not.
---
I will test that now, thanks.
---
Y’all are champs thx 4 your service
---
Really? For me it lets me change it from collecting BoS items to fashnacht. I'm sure all collectotrons allow it
---
Long live Mother Russia comrades!
---
Whahaha! You think a nuke will effect me?
---
I will say getting 2 SS armor pieces with -50% fall damage makes the game that much more fun. No fall damage, any height. Makes jetpacking tons of fun!
---
My Gauss Shotgun is a bloodied 1 star and I only use PA. I also don't use VATS with it to get the magic shotgun effect.
---
even commies pay outside contractors lol
---
ooooooh that's promising :) thanks for the info!
---
It's unrealistic that my clothes are always dirty when detergent and water are plentiful in the wasteland but there you go.
---
Up to this point you could easily switch from shotguns to heavy weapons and this changes that so it isn't even a question of realism.
---
I need more info about sneak in boss fight something turns me crazy, no mobs but still in danger.
---
I can try a mixed set of unyeling for testing, your point of view of damage resistant increasing or decreasing is interesting
---
well idk about that but I have a serrated account thats level 85 and I didnt know what i was doing when I started so I have no specific build and im not powerful in anything
---
Ok, gotcha. That's what I thought I had done at first and freaked out. Double freaked when I saw two PS4 receipts. They were for the free psn games this month lol.
---
Here I am with the standard one because I love the random junk I can get xd
---
-Also, better dead than Red!-
---
Hmm maybe the numbers are due to explosions doing like 20% of the total, so things won't align...
---
Which is easily where this bullshit began. Also it's hard not to leave the forest when you've COMPLETED THE GAME.
---
This is my favorite event because for the last several months I haven’t fired a shot during it and it’s several minutes of me having a snack break.
---
Here’s exactly how I make it so you don’t have to do anything.  As soon as you spawn at the event (not the place) run to the brazier and light it.  Immediately run and jump over the wall to the side speaker.  Run past the side speaker and onto the road outside.  Run up the road and stop where it turns right to go into the temple.  Stop here and wait.  Every single speaker MIGHT get destroyed except for the side speaker.  If you see the other speaker health going down and being destroyed THIS IS FINE.  Every time I have done this it’s about 95% of the time all speakers EXCEPT for the side speaker get destroyed.  If other people show up, this will ruin the glitch and you might have to run back in.
---
Enjoy!
---
Oh, here’s another.  Uranium Fever can also be done this way.  Run into the mine, start up the mining process and run back up the mine to the exit.  You can actually leave the mine and sit next to the foreman bot standing there and the event will proceed without failing.  I usually sit at the door myself, but buddies have shown me you can actually leave the mine and still complete it.
---
You should look up the photomode glitch and launching nukes! Super helpful.
---
See? Enclave is looking a little less sinister now, isn't it?
---
No I know that but for effectiveness purposes you rly should charge it
---
I believe there's current a problem to do with atoms and  subs purchased, it seems steams is affected by this so I don't think your purchase will have gone through yet even though it says it has.
---
Wow really detailed, I will keep it in mind
---
That’s the vibe I get listening to the BoS radio broadcast. They’re coming not to help but take over .
---
Slightly off topic: how long is BOS Collectron out for? I haven't been keeping up.
---
Laughing damn hard at the use of "power creeps" like they're people
---
No options to change on the BoS for me, others I can.
---
Oh that’s a nice trick.  I’ll have to try that.  So for Colossal Problem, do I just tag along with some high level guys and avoid taking damage and loot the dead mobs?  I do have power armor and a hazmat suit for the nuclear blast area.
---
The best collections are ammo/weapons from the raider collectron and xmas stuff from the Santa collectron. Everything else is a glorified skin. 
---
Which is a shame,.considering the BoS one could easily have a mode to collect energy ammunition (fusion cells, 2mm) and scrap laser rifles. 
---
Instead we're getting the same materials we donated back in the first place
---
Yeah, the joys of cannibalism 🤓😱
---
It’s a shame Lyons’ Brotherhood wasn’t how the entire brotherhood was... I can only imagine what happened in the 10 years between FO3 and FO4. How Maxon came to power... Wonder what happened to Elder Lyons and Sarah?
---
You can select the guns option on the BOS one when you own the raider one no?
---
I need you, lol.  I need 1 more recipe for the learn 76 recipes character challenge.
---
That is one thought I had... Maybe in a way it would make silo runs easier? I imagine if the BOS took them over they’d fix the damn reactor room and doors and stuff so you don’t have to do all that annoying prep shite that takes an hour.
---
Let’s hope it’s not like last year....I got MAYBE 2 good runs without crashing each game.
---
I think vanguard sent works pretty good with all the new updates and nerfs, I have 3 bloody builds with unyielding sentinel sets and they easily die unless they are in sneak mode all the time or if your jumping constantly and killing everything too fast 
---
 But honestly armor and weapons rolls... Who cares just be a food build you get the best results 👍
---
Not soon enough!!!
---
The toys it gave yielded screws
---
You're hurt by me insulting your reading comprehension in response to you insulting my writing skills to me and passive aggressively to random replies under my post? I didn't think it was even that big of an issue until I found you complaining and making fun of me to anyone who will listen. The peace sign was because I thought I would have nothing more to say to you at the time. Didn't cross my mind you were going to attempt to make yourself a victim over harmless back and forth, you started for no reason btw, on reddit. My bad.
---
Silly question: does it use 1 ammo for a full charge or more? With my perk cards it says that a blast can do 600 dps. I need to go and see in the ammo section I guess.
---
No won't happen because EA Maryland gets a full worksheet noting every 1* Nocturnal Rolling Pin dropped &amp; They all Circle Jerk on it first thing in their Monday Morning Meeting. Because They Hate Us...
---
Does not work for me. I tried storing the station and redeploying... still get that Dorsey message.
---
PS: I am on PC.
---
Until you look at all the experimentations that the enclave do haha.
---
Oh damn that sucks. It's so much fun.
---
No full charge or quick tap it all uses the same ammo 1 shot
---
I sacrifice calculators to appease it...I get results
---
I want the R91 assault rifle instead of the assault rifle
---
Yeah the options are guns and ammo or chems and aid.
---
Picked up a vampires 50cal ffr for 1500 😊
---
Hmm, not particularly funny either and seems to have a very condescending personality. That seems to cover nearly all of the Brotherhood of Steel that we have ever interacted with.
---
Would've made sense to at least be limited to circuitry, fiber optics, etc
---
Noooooo, damn im not sure, sorry man!
---
Yep just can’t spend it until you finish the raid
---
Foolish Capitalist Scum!
---
Showing any holstered weapon would be nice.
---
Thanks! I thought that something was strange with the damage numbers.🤓 I love this gauss shotguns, great against vendigos during ACP.
---
Do you also own the game through steam and not bethesda launcher?
---
If you bought the FO1st on steam but don't own the game on steam could be the problem.
---
Also if this is truly a mistake you're better off contacting support no one here could really do anything.
---
You need to already have unlocked a different type, which I suspect you haven't
---
Oh no Enclave is still sketchy AF, but they’re like, openly sketchy you know? People kinda know the enclave is the bad guys, always have been always will be. Modus is more than happy to let us drop nukes for the sole purpose of upgrading guns and whatnot. (Encourages us to do so even.)
---
But there definitely is some kinda sinister undertone to the BOS’s arrival I just can’t shake...
---
(Still like the Enclaves scout armor though, it’s pretty badass looking.)
---
You're right. We're both pretentious and awful. I'll concede that.
---
But anyway:
---
*You're hurt by me insulting your reading comprehension in response to you insulting my writing skills to me and passive aggressively to random replies under my post?*
---
I am not hurt, again, this is simple projection. Just because I am able to cut you with my words doesn't mean that you have the same effect on me. If anything, I am annoyed. Because I was interested in the nonexistent camp item you mentioned.
---
*I didn't think it was even that big of an issue until I found you complaining and making fun of me to anyone who will listen.*
---
I replied to one person in the thread who was confused by your wording. It was a throwaway comment, "OP is bad at words." That hardly constitutes "making fun of you to anyone who will listen." 
---
*The peace sign was because I thought I would have nothing more to say to you at the time. Didn't cross my mind you were going to attempt to make yourself a victim over harmless back and forth, you started for no reason btw, on reddit. My bad.*
---
Now you're just being facetious.
---
It's not like you find useful legendary effects ever either.
---
Yup those bastards can overwhelm you quick if u don’t take em out
---
The main storyline has some of the biggest pushover NPCs when they actually throw them at you.
---
Agreed, but still in 2020 and MAGA hats it's more relevant than ever.
---
You may need to enter the power armor frame and then equip the pieces from inventory to put them on the frame. Once you exit the armor the pieces should stay on it. Ran into something similar with my T-65 when I accidentally took a piece off. Must be part of locking atomic shop power armor so it can't be traded. Good luck with it.
---
Especially the part about “This isn’t up for negotiations” right? That’s what mainly had me worried.
---
Subbing is bugged at the moment, it won't have actually gone through even though steam thinks it has. Your best bet would be steam support in this case I would imagine.
---
I got the BoS collection and switched him to collect scrap. 
---
Worth it. He walks around my camp and said “I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed” to me. It’s great.
---
Ah two more days it says, not really a long time to claim it... They should have extended the community event rewards for like a month or something.
---
Please keep politics out of our games....we play to get away from that Bullshit.
---
fucckkk. Thanks.
---
thanks !
---
I don't log in until at least 4pm CST and it happened to me often. One time it was every. Single. Challenge. Both weekly and daily were marked as complete (back when they awarded atoms). After the the season started, I had the "complete 5 daily challenges" marked as complete on login once and only 4 of the others were completed https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hnrinq/logged_in_to_5_dailies_already_completed_and_no, and another where that one was completed and *zero* other challenges were completed, an obvious bug.
---
That's a good enough gs really.
---
Unless you want a bloodied.
---
Subbing at the moment is currently bugged and won't actually work even though the payment will have gone through. Your best bet is a ticket to support to try and sort the issue out.
---
I think you get it on your main account once patch 22 goes live.
---
Just moved my camp to that dog 2 days ago, his name is Dingo and now King Cranberry the mirelurk king from cranberry bog is there to keep Dingo company!
---
Dude it's horrible. I remember being afraid to fight death claws in older titles. Now they're chumps. Everything is weak unless it's a bullet sponge legendary. I hate that. I enjoy playing cause it's fallout with friends but it sucks that the fun kinda died really quickly. I get enjoying but we can't be blind to the massive screw ups of this game
---
This has been an argument since day 1. Its bethesda controlling player experience times.
---
Yeah just join the event. It is likely there will be multiple high levels you can piggyback. Join a public team with them if you can, hit wendigos so you get credit for the kill, and loot as many as you can. You won’t drop your scrap if you die during an event. After the event you exit the mine into a blast zone. So be prepared for that.
---
Edit: I know I’m encouraging some questionable behavior, but i personally don’t mind a low level tagging along for these events. I remember the days of desperately needing screws lol
---
I can imagine some weird scenario where it goes to add Atoms to account A. Accidentally puts them on account B because some backend pointer is doing something dumb. Checks to see if account A got the Atoms. It didn't? Okay well add the Atoms again....
---
Repeat.
---
Or a weapon skin, that'd be nice
---
Yeah really dope spot and a ton of fun to climb the trees with marsupial
---
I noticed I can't change them if I build them in workshops, but I can in my camp
---
Just to clarify, it's an all or nothing package deal. But congrats on the rare award.
---
The options for collection are Chems and Aid or Weapons and Ammo!
---
I have Ace the Raider and he now has the BoS option, but the BoS itself does not...
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification my dude.
---
Probably even better with carnivore!
---
Uuuuh i dunno man. I mean you're literally killing communists in the name of American freedom and capitalism in season 2.
---
Your statement sounds a tad hypocritical.
---
How is this even possible o.O
---
Yup. One Wasteland doesn't fix anything either. There will just be marginally higher XP enemies that may or may not hit harder.
---
No Deathclaw should be under L50 but oh well
---
If you only want to farm xp, then joining popular events. Make sure there are other people who are higher level than you at the event. Events &gt; farming at your level. 
---
If you don't want to milk xp from events, toxic area up north, running Charleston capital, or grinding stuff in ash heap is probably the way.
---
Is there any confirmation of survival legacies like the unstoppable monster being rewards for daily ops ? I’ve seen several players post this but haven’t seen any definitive answers.
---
Dude, it's a game.
---
But my bunker protects against nukes!
---
But for real did you throw the Nuke grenade in bunker the other day
---
Friends in high places? My first mule account was gifted to me, tbqh.
---
But does the FRR apply since you’ve gotta charge each shot?
---
Oh yeah, Dorsey's absolutely getting the frosty boot. He's the stand-in for every BoS fanboy who thinks they'll get to be part of the club.
---
I think we'll see a desperate BoS in Steel Dawn, who are willing to accept our help despite thinking we're a bunch of degenerate wasters. I imagine there'll be a grind to get in their good graces, perhaps necessitating the removal of your mutations.
---
&amp; then in Fractured Steel a fundamentalist splinter group will have had enough of the Chapter's tolerance, &amp; could be an actively hostile force, maybe even ditching the BoS altogether - that or the main quest'll involve a choice between reuniting the Chapter or helping one or both sides forge a new path.
---
These are my hopes.
---
Cosmetics in the camp could very well be cannon tho. There can be vault dwellers who ended up becoming cultists, communists because they're angry at America for what happened, heavy patriots, or people who REALLY love Fasnascht Day.
---
What does it collect the new one? Raider has been my favourite so far all those chems
---
Unyielding is the best for every build.
---
Chameleon isn't so strong cuz the Unyielding sneak bonus has a bigger impact on detection.
---
Escape Artist perk is core if you depend on sneak
---
Holy crap that can happen on ANY savage divide event and not just Uranium Fever?? This is an interesting turn of events...
---
Apparently your reading comprehension is lacking.
---
Ive seen a post of a "whistle in the dark" being a daily ops reward. I beleive it was a plan though and you could craftnit with modules. But im not 100% sure, i saw it over on the PTS forum. 
---
There was also talk the "gutter" plan was a reward and you were able to craft legendary versions of it aswell. So im aure there will be more.
---
Because most high demand weapons are worth up to 3x the cap limit, and are commonly traded for other weapons or gear equal to to its value
---
Oh yeah! Like I said, I'm not saying this doesn't happen. It's just the ones that immediately are right at 11 and I'm like, are you sure you're just not a minute early or that the game doesn't need to be restarted? Maybe I should just do a better job of interpreting it or they should do a better job of clarifying. 
---
The timing of stuff, and I don't know why this is, is actually a really big issue with the community. Back when the atomic shop clothing would glitch out the companions, I had so many people tell me that the companions only gave out a quest every few days. The companions definitely give out a quest every 24 hours from when you finish the last one from them. I knew this because I had tested it multiple times and did quests from them multiple days in a row. And this is just one example. I've had a lot of people confuse the timing of stuff. So, I automatically wonder just how many people are experiencing a glitch and how many people don't understand what time it is.
---
Sweet! Checked it out a week or so ago and nothing. Someone else must have popped them
---
I don't know, he's talking about ammo, radaway and stimpaks. Yet he's just collecting the same junk as the standard collectron. Smells buggy
---
"What would you do with $1 million?"
---
I use Skeetshooter to get better spread and Demolition Expert 5 with my quad explosive shotgun. Work good, especially with the "magic" 15% armor piece.
---
Pick up 180 items and go back
---
Exactly. And it should let us pick which side we wanna fight on.
---
All media has political leanings whether you believe it or not. You can never escape.
---
Keep your Instigating one. I use one as well can pretty much one shot everything with the full charge
---
Thanks !
---
And this is why I have either goat legs or I'm in PA.
---
Damn! I mean it’s awesome to have a ton of awesome stuff but holy fuck! What a nightmare to sort through!
---
I’m gonna but does the ffr “work”?
---
Do you run one of those nonsensical bloody builds, because that may be the issue. I run a vanguard supehero type build and I can jump from most places and take less than 50 damage. Depending on where I jump the rads would be able to fill the remainder of my bar before any food or stimpack will. I used to have the issue with dying from falls all the time until I got the bird bones mutation.
---
Respectfully disagree. I want Grahm to be talking to me throughout the whole transaction.
---
Almost every timer is real time.
---
The only thing that depends on in-game time is the day/night cycle.
---
You already got your Commie Bundle in the Atomic Shop.
---
And, ummm, Season 2 has as many "commie" rewards as "USA" rewards.
---
Seasons doesn't have you on a "side."
---
You are correct on that first part but i don't agree with the second one.I know the guass shotgun is powerful but with patch 22 it will get nerfed a lot so stealth and the gauss shotgun will go great together.I don't wish for it to be even more powerful it is enough powerful,i just want a barrel suited for stealth.Which brings me to my next topic,"The Gauss Shotguns immense murder power comes at a cost of not being a good stealth weapon."Wrong,it does not come at any cost you can still sneak with the gauss shotgun even TYR says it in his video.Infact you can sneak with any shotgun!I don't see why people think you can only sneak with rifles.
---
As i said i only want a barrel that is suited dor stealth.
---
My guess is the same thing will happen to Dorsey that happens to Deputy Beagle in New Vegas... Fired after you helped him out and brought law back to Primm. Bwa ha ha.
---
I like your ideas, that sounds awesome.
---
(And my mutations cost me a fortune to get them all specifically, the Brotherhood can all go sex their own bodies if removing mutations is a requirement to get in...)
---
Deleted my last reply agreeing, since you added all the extra stuff after your original "we're both pretentious and awful".
---
I have to dedicate entire nights to just sorting, especially if there's been a recent dupe wave and I've had to either packmule a bunch of stuff or my crew comes over to gift me a bunch of cool stuff. I have two characters dedicated *just* to holding plans.
---
My spreadsheets are definitely not done.
---
And the "settlers" are pretty little socialists, you can go play with Ward &amp; Paige.
---
Sure, yeah, "we." Definitely didn't miss the party or anything. Nope, not me. Not good ole' "socially active" me.
---
The Shishkebab tank was nice as well, remember that it also had a glove so as not to burn the hand? Half the uniqueness of all these weapons gone just because they wouldn't be arsed add proper holstering and weapon visibility for Fo4.
---
I’m down, dm me your GT and I’ll join you.
---
Anyone have a list of the loot tables for each one
---
Yes, doctors mask, but the glasses are not available now and are only Obtainable through the atomic shop.
---
join public teams (building or events). do as many events/quests as you can.
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7AQ5GAVUAAWOuU.png
---
Wait this really works?
---
Agreed. Although I found a quad laser rifle while leveling, 111 shots in automatic mode. I love that thing SO much.
---
They don’t give any details about what the exploit was. Therefore, they have not stated that getting more material from scrapping than used for crafting is an exploit. 
---
You’re saying that’s what the exploit was. Bethesda didn’t say that. They didn’t say anything other than *‘There was an exploit. We fixed it’.* Unlike the one they cited about bows, where they state it allowed for a faster firing rate. 
---
But if you think it’s an exploit, then go report it to Bethesda.
---
If you seriously think anyone is going to get banned for getting some extra leather, when it took them months to ban dupers, and some of them only got temp-bans, then you are quite mistaken and misguided.
---
Is there any thought to working on a PC mod to do this sort of thing?
---
Seems like the kind of thing that could be tracked with a mod, even if it initially requires a visit from the plan mule.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A939QRRSNV4
---
Thats great. The BoS should not be huggable and nice.
---
chameleon and agility serve different purposes. with chameleon, you're undetectable while stationary. that' not the case with unyielding/agility, where enemies can bump into you and put you in danger.
---
higher agility helps you sneak around.
---
As said, public events to tag enemies gains a bunch of XP.  Otherwise... the story and quests have level ups built into them.  Tadpole backpack quest, BoS, Enclave, Wastelanders, these all have XP built into them and are needed to advance anyway.  
---
I’ve leveled up nine characters now.   Other than depending on someone else power leveling me, the above were the most efficient level ups for me.
---
 I’d love to know what they all collect, I’ve had mine set to junk since I first got it..
---
Lmao I just realised:
---
&gt;  Please keep politics out of our games....we play to get away from that Bullshit.
---
*Has Enclave flair next to his username*
---
This post come back every 3months 😅
---
Smarter people than me say it is possible. Just finding the time to do it. The dataminers run by Eckserah would be the people to talk to
---
"I'd tell you what I'd do man, two chicks at the same time man"
---
I used to always have PA in the inventory mainly for when lode baring comes up so I can get quad ore. However, my issue is that I get a better carry weight not in PA, even if it is excavator armor. My normal CW usually is around 325 but after a pepperoni roll and a deathclaw steak I can get that magical 420 CW just not the quadruple ore yields like excavator decides to do sometimes.
---
Nuke them and put them in their place!! We were here first and are much more powerful as a Vault 76 faction!!
---
Had the same thing happen today. Only reason I'm pissed about it is I'm at 95 out of a hundred...
---
Someone never wants me to complete this grind...
---
these mules are only for looking, you don't trade with them
---
Really don't understand the definition of playing a game, do you?
---
If they don’t give you your stuff back, you should totally never get 1st again. And make sure to contact your payment method and have the month you paid for returned. If Bethesda doesn’t fix ofc
---
I, personally, love those things about Fo4's Brotherhood. They're the natural conclusions to the group's ideology. Their mission to help humanity is a centuries-long endeavor - a pipe dream, that one day they'll have all the dangerous things &amp; then civilization can try again.
---
It's entirely futile, &amp; yet they're committed 100%. When they're just a few people in a bunker, they're relatively harmless. But take it up to scale? Engage in much larger projects of securing &amp; confiscating technology?
---
Arthur Maxon's BoS is the only way that ends.
---
Heck, the Camden Park dailies don't seem to reset every 24 hours consistently, but I can actually test that now since I didn't have internet on my desktop for a week and did them at the same time last night.
---
I've had some of them not pop up two days in a row and others pop up consistently, and other times they wouldn't show up in my daily quests until I actually traveled to the park.
---
Nuke em all holiday weekend
---
Came here to say this. You’re doing the lord’s work.
---
Ffr is best on full auto fast firing weapons.  It may help a little but isn’t that helpful for this weapon IMO, the instigating makes it a keeper but there’s no harm trying to roll a stronger one.
---
Missing out my friend, the rest are pretty naff but the raider ones drops alcohol and decent chems. Fascnacht is pretty decent too for food and bubblegum
---
Fair enough. Well, thanks for your contribution to the community all the same. You do us proud :)
---
This shouldn't come as a surprise. Like Rhys says in 4, "There's Brotherhood and there's everyone else."
---
They're coming back to settle a score and finish the job. Saving others is a collateral benefit, not the point.
---
Just sent DM
---
You thought the BoS Collectron was gonna have a sense of humor? That’s funny.
---
Sorry not sure i understand (english is my second language)
---
Also disagree.  The vendor at Pleasant Valley Station makes me laugh every time.
---
*"You can't stab people, unless you buy something to do the stabbing with".*
---
He just really seems to genuinely enjoy stabbing.  I appreciate that.
---
Jeebus.
---
Open items are tracked separately from containers.
---
the least i could ask for&lt;3
---
The no true patriots fallacy
---
You don't have to charge each shot really, as far as I know the shotgun shines in 3rd person view, which for some reason fires faster to begin with and ffr should add up to that nicely.
---
Unfortunately I use vats so my gauss has been underutilized. 😒
---
This has got me feeling good about the legendary perk system now. I’m really excited with what they have added. My only concern was that I would be at a disadvantage as I have respeced by build multiple times. 
---
Hopefully they will add perk card packs as rewards for new events or a possible drop from daily ops.
---
Thanks for letting us know👍🏼.
---
BoSuCkS
---
You just said you want a barrel suited for stealth, meaning you think it currently isn't suited for stealth. 
---
So which is it? If you can already sneak with it then why does it need a change in barrels? Yes you can sneak with any weapon. But if you don't have a suppressor you're going to have a lot less effectiveness once the loud shots break your sneak and you no longer get the sneak bonus. What part of a barrel suited for stealth do you mean if not talking about a suppressor. 
---
And what part of the Patch 22 is going to nerf the gauss Shotgun? If it's magic effects, the shotgun I use doesn't have any magic effects and I don't use it in VATS. Nor do I take any shotgun damage perks besides bloody mess. And even though I use a bloodied shotgun. It still kills Wendigo Spawns in one charged shot while I'm above 50% health. As well as killing just about everything else in one shot as long as I hit the enemy with the full shot. 
---
Unless I understand it wrong, Patch 22 is changing the damage formula to make all damage buffs additive instead of multiplicative. Which would be hitting stealth most of all due to stealth applying the 2-2.5x multiplier after all the other damage buffs.
---
I don't know enough about chameleon armour to explain his it works properly, sorry. I stares my junkies build with vanguard armour, very quickly realises that with the adrenal reaction mutation plus a few points in defensive perks I was doing a lot better. Then I switched to 2 bolstering and 3 unyielding. Obviously you don't get the same buffs as full unyielding but for leveling up it makes a huge difference.
---
Take a shotgun to line in the sand, rad rumble, guided meditation, and tag stuff.
---
I think, Karen is the feminine form of Chad.
---
Just worked for me!
---
Even better idea - you can’t take damage from foreign camp objects
---
I believe it took half a day or so before it went through when I ordered through steam. If it isn't there within 24 hours I'd certainly followup.
---
That is to say, it isn't an instant subscription when done through Steam
---
You the real mvp.
---
Don’t get why Beth is sleeping on Modus :(
---
lmao exactly
---
hey, /u/marc_luscher - how about adjusting your damn audio settings?
---
Lyons died of old age &amp; Sarah was killed in combat.
---
Oh yes i forgot! The Shishkebab tank was pretty dope and the mitten was cute.
---
&gt;On one hand this is good for players who respecced and thus lost coins unknowingly.
---
How exactly did respecing cause people to lose coins?    I don't doubt  that it's true but I am not clear on how that works. Does sinking more points into a perk card make the card worth more coins?  Is that why?
---
MODUS is a tool - a tool that can be used. Rebuilding the Appalachian Enclave for the betterment of the region is the future...not some hokey traitors from the West Coast, looking to steal our tech.
---
How?!
---
It helps that OP is praising the game.  A different opinion wouldn't have been met so well.
---
What else will this grenade trick work on lol
---
It would be just cosmetic and that is the point.
---
To get those backpacks in F76 as cosmetic backpack skins!
---
East Coast BoS are so milk toast. If it were a West Coast collectron, it would have been old world tech, energy &amp; heavy ammo &amp; maybe even technical data.
---
Because this is r/fo76 and everyone’s a hater
---
this is no fallacy this is fallout
---
Yeah. Lots of caffeine, sweat, and tears. 😂👍
---
I’m also down.  You doing them on private?  Shoot me a DM
---
I’ve seen posts about getting the outfit but none that mentioned the helmet.
---
Yep, there are enough gaps in the message that someone infatuated by the idea of the military/BoS (Dorsey) could see it as a incoming rescue alert. I think he’s going to be in for a rude awakening, albeit a short-lived one (literally).
---
Ah I see, I just cancelled it via web and Xbox will refund me. I thought I was doing something wrong at first like I hadn't linked something to something else or I was missing something that should have be obvious. Thank you very much for letting me know  👍
---
I've never seen anyone with the BoS hood or the flight helmet so I've been selling them for a lot more. Well by selling I mean I have them priced for a lot more, I haven't sold any yet. Lol
---
It does not affect charge, but it’s still a great roll.
---
Fr, I have 97 3* waiting to scrip and over 1k treasury notes. I could not play for a month and just do the limits and still have stuff left
---
No i didn't. Does the bunker really protect against nukes? If so thats pretty cool.
---
The only way that ends... A smoldering crater at the airport where the Prydwyn used to be?
---
HA! I dumped so many Legendary weapons and armor in various trash cans before the Legendary exchange or player vendors became a thing it's unreal.
---
Miniguns are silly but the amunition/battery backpack makes it a lil bit more real
---
Okie dokie
---
That's XCOM Baby!
---
Would it if effect if I “tap” shot it?
---
what if the “fractured steel” means that a small group of them wanna help and are allied with us but the majority turn into an antagonist faction? 
---
prob not tho lol its beth
---
You are correct.  An access card is required to enter.
---
Still have Unstoppable Monster, No way in hell would I ever give that one up for anything
---
It took a few nades but the outfit eventually moved just enough so that a small portion was poking through the glass and it allowed me to interact...the hat I had to jump on to the table next to the case so I could get an upper view then I just moved the cursor around the wall to the right just like in the picture he posted. Takes a little work
---
No. The bolt action doesn’t have a receiver that gives it auto fire. The faster fire rate is pretty much useless on weapons like that.
---
Did u get your fo1st and legit atoms back? If not that's some major bs
---
Yup.  I accidentally wandered into one and got a whiff of the 100 rad/sec, haha.  But I have a knack for wandering around in places and taking on level 40-60 enemies at level 23, lol.  I’ll suit up in my raider powder armor or radiation suit.
---
Might add a roll to see if your game crashes before you can loot the body.
---
Its a bolt action, it has to fire one round at a time. There is not a way to make it automatic as that'd defeat the purpose of the bolt. It's meant to be like a makeshift hunting rifle. There are some receiver modifications which I believe can make the fire rate faster, but other than that you can't make it auto.
---
2 isn't a small suggestion.
---
Given you've played since beta, you understand how lazy Bethesda are. 2 requires the creation of new models, textures, new sound assets in terms of adding a suppressor as well as the weapon stat changes.
---
Sadly Bethesda isn't going to give this shit away for free.
---
I agree it should be a simple request but I've given up expecting this to change. It took Bethesda months to give us basic mods for the secret service armour that we'd all expect to have at the launch of said item.
---
Root-tootin’, shit shootin’ gunslinger i see 🌵
---
Probably will drop them in Adventure server
---
DM sent!
---
I dared not experiment with the jetpack until I had two pieces of 50% dmg reduction.
---
What? I have completely different beverages in each.
---
The reclaimed mask? If you're on PC you can have one of mine.
---
Yeah, I've killed myself with explosive weapons more often than I have enemies (especially shotguns). They're not worth in to me.
---
Works for me
---
Yessir!
---
Agh that’s rather sad... Not very many people left alive after the Lone Wanderers time.
---
(I think my Lone Wanderer would be sad, only people left alive that she knew in DC would be MacCready, Maxon, and Doctor Li. Two of which she didn’t like and one of which was the closest thing she had left of a family... that’s choosing to help the antagonists of FO4.)
---
Of course not, they'll roll up in their big ass airship and be like "We're the good guys". Everyone forgets they are 100% not, and just accepts it.
---
Never had a collectron and was looking forward to this one...but if I'm understanding this correctly, I need to have a collectron already to use the BoS bits?
---
I usually pick up one or the other every other day - though I hate it when I get a run of green bandanas! - or so and just throw them in the vendor (on xbox) after I got them for my collection. Picked up a bunch of the BOS lab coats, some arktos lab coats as well I think. 
---
They do sell for me, probably because they're so cheap...but they're pretty easy to find again so I don't sweat it.
---
It’s also very likely that the BOS stole the nuclear reactor from Rivet City to power the Prydwyn.
---
Nope.
---
Funny the whole post is about avoiding doing anything, and you get downvoted.
---
I completely forgot these existed tbh. Just now wondering why we've never had them.
---
No, this one is really free and works even if it is your only collectron
---
That was the second thought that crossed my mind, immediately tried to think of places that has displays that we could use this trick. Ha ha ha
---
I'd rather be able to level up the overpriced turrets at my camp.
---
They are dicks of the highest order, but they are still the general good guys of the setting, generally involved in resolving any given threat. They helped stop the Master. They stopped the Calculator. They saved Carbon and surrounds from a new Super Mutant army. They had a hand in dealing with the Enclave the first time, albeit a tiny one and partially for their own gain, but still. Of course we have Lyons and his crusade against the Mutants and then Enclave. And in FO4 they are there to find and destroy the Institute, a group of mad scientists responsible for 80% of the horrors the Commonwealth is going through, and they take out raiders and mutant camps on patrols they have no need to do, \*and\* in 76 the Appalachia Chapter is all that holds back the Scorched long enough for the measures we take to actually exist. They are Jerk-Ass Heroes, or at least Anti-Heroes.
---
This is a post-apocalyptic nightmare fuel setting. They are positively saints going by other examples. I mean, you could have the Judges from Judge Dredd.
---
As someone else said there seems to be a short period when you fast travel where things are still loading in that you don't take fall damage...so anything you took was probably at the tail end of that so it only had you falling a small bit.
---
Same reason when you fast travel you can sprint full out for several seconds without using up any AP.
---
If I’m not reminded I can’t pay with human flesh, then how will I know thats not acceptable tinder?
---
Man you’re obsessed with op aren’t you
---
No but you can only earn the "elder" tier reward once every day.
---
I’m hoping they just chase him off rather than kill him... Maxon (FO4) may have turned me against the brotherhood, but Dorsey was a nice fellow I thought.
---
It's scrip. Let it go &amp; hope for a better role next time
---
that's the reward for completing it in less than 8 minutes right?
---
Nah, you can keep trying as much as you want until you get elder rank or if you want to grind ammo/xp.
---
You can redo them however you can only get the rewards once per day is I believe how it works.
---
Ohh! Thought you meant the vault tec truck lol. If you get that to come out then I will shower you in gifts
---
It doesn’t sadly, but the shop says it does lol
---
I've never got a 3-star item from a 3-star scorchbeast
---
Uhg.  
---
Revisionists.
---
Okay that's great! Thanks.
---
Yeah that should be covered.
---
Okay cool, thank you!
---
Obviously.
---
Am I obsessed with you if I keep replying to a conversation that you've continued?
---
yes.
---
How awesome would it be to have like a burning cowbell on the death tambo. You can support people in need when they scream out "we need more cowbell!". Then you spring into action creating a symphony of destruction that even Megadeth would be proud of.
---
Okay thank you for the feedback!
---
Exactly. And so much of that crap is duped. I prefer to earn my items and not have to worry someday my account will be gone because I decided to trade with some donkey dick that though duping was a good thing. LoL
---
Oh lol!!!
---
I stored my Commie one and was able to place down the BoS without scrapping.
---
in combat. it only kicks in if you're hidden.
---
That would be in what 2077 LOL
---
Right, I understand that. I’m just not sure how good they would look without the weapons matching up with them anymore.
---
Thank you, just saved me some caps.
---
Your sneak status needs to be hidden. Out of combat.
---
None. It’s SS.
---
&gt; revoke my FO1st
---
At that point I would just refund the fucking game itself.
---
Nope, it is a secret that provides a service
---
Damn... Maxon really screwed things up then? All the lone wandererer’s hard work...
---
(If my Lone Wanderer would meet Maxon present day she’d probably say “You were a good boy Maxon... Shame you turned out to be such a sh*t man.” And if she met MacCready she’d probably say “You were a little prick when you were younger but you’ve gotten better.” Ha ha ha)
---
I went to a CAMP the other day with a 3 star legendary Deathclaw. I figured it was a pet but then Beckett started shooting it so I joined in. Did I kill somebody's pet?
---
I may finally switch what mine collects. I love my free grenades, but screws and ballistic fiber? Yes, please.
---
I sent bethesda a feedback ticket  about a year ago saying that I would buy fallout1st if I could host private matches and make the rules per lobby, such as melee only, automatics only, no explosives, but no answer. I play on xbox so I dont really have to worry about hackers but the gauss shitgun and people using vats for grenades has caused me to stop playing
---
Yes i did say i just wanted a barrel for stealth.It isn't fully suited for stealth if it doesn't have something that surpresses the sound.You can still sneak with it but the chances of you getting detected are kinda higher without a suppresor.
---
Patch 22 isn't just nerfing the gauss shotgun it is nerfing everything.How damage is calculated and damage bonuses so it won't be as powerful.
---
Anyway im sorry if i made you mad that was not my intention.
---
I just want a suppresor for the gauss shotgun.Yes you can still sneak with it but it would be a lot better with a suppresor.
---
The nodes count as containers?
---
NP ;)
---
People who report bugs get banned remember so stay quiet
---
It won't let me redeem it, it just keeps making the purchase noise without unlocking it...
---
i want them to give us the plans for the season's fireworks at level 100
---
Pretty silly way to do a thing, imo, and certainly not in the spirit of things. The UI being a bottleneck may be intentional. 😂
---
How long is it available until?
---
The raider one was definitely worth it.
---
Sounds like a good idea - maybe you should be in charge of the legendary run.
---
Not even a little.
---
Seems that way, thought it would be best to bring it up to not get banned, but seeing as to what has happened to this poor lad, I’m inclined to agree with you.
---
Not surprised that their robot would have the same superiority complex that they do lol.
---
Will people get banned if this glitch happens? Or only if they spend the atoms? I want to know what I should do if it happened to me
---
Just wanted to chime in to say I've used this amazing service and I highly recommend it!
---
And this worries me....I love that event!
---
Ohh this is good . I usually Jetpack to the top of the smoke stack and afk . Do the dishes or sweep the kitchen , come back to some canned goodness .
---
They need to remove them to add in more caps, gold, and scrip drops!
---
I like this collectron. He's pretty quiet compared to the rest. Although I was a bit annoyed at him when he announced Elder Maxon wouldn't be impressed with my camp. Tough, I like my camp.
---
Gives 34 awards to something people have been saying for years reddit moment
---
Thanks for the comments. Spring traps are sort of what I'd want. But, I'd want them to throw people in a much larger, higher arc, and it'd be nice if they could be disguised with the standard floor designs to make them extra-surprise-ey.
---
You're roght it doesn't work. Apparently he plays 6 hours a day while looking at youtube.
---
I was hoping it would have a weapon option similar to the raider one. Hopefully they add that for an Enclave one.
---
Save your caps and do the Beckett quest-line.
---
Really good Cal. 50 as reward
---
I love that soothing voice 😁👍
---
I miss holstering so much.
---
I understand *why* it doesn't exist, clipping issues and all that. But if you could add backpacks in 76, why can't you add weapons on your back in 4?
---
I would be very disappointed if the new TES came out and they didn't have holsters weapons.
---
Well lunchboxes will be something to spend that gold on once I get everything I want lmao
---
Curious. Where do you get all your Quantums?
---
Look for a non legendary fixer to hold you over for now, as a legendary goes for much more than 4k caps. Heavies you may be able to get a good one for that amount, but save up enough and you should be able to get your hands on some good legendary heavies or commando rifles. Of course don't forget to grab your scrip each day and go for those ranged weapons.
---
Everytime I go to guided meditation it's 1 ghoul and then a good 6 minutes of peaceful nothingness lol. Maybe I just so happen to have it glitch on me or something but I always do it when I see it and it's always 1 ghoul and then just literal meditation lmao
---
I love when the server is lagging at an event , Jump and jet pack for one second  then end up in orbit . Hope you don’t burn up in reentry lol
---
I was expecting a robot to boast about the brotherhood.  Not to be condensing in my own camp.  My alt is actually BOS roleplay.  
---
Also the items it collects are useless.  A real kick in the face when the paid versions are miles ahead.  I wasn't happy with them being utility and not just cosmetic in the shop in the first place.  But a bit insulting the free version collects trash items.
---
The only reason I can see they made the voice lines the way they did is the tie in with the BOS content coming. We get they are bullies and basically the bad guys, but don't flanderize them and make them a cariacture of who they are. 
---
Sorry about the rant.  After a few game breaking quest bugs and 4 crashes today I'm a bit jaded.  Love the game but some of the stuff I get excited about turn out to be disappointing.  See ammo convertor, star lamp, bunker, SS underarmor, ghillie suit, cosmos bowl hat.  Granted they fixed some of them.
---
Nukashine is a reward... lol....0
---
I love the communist one. His speech is so pathetic it is funny.
---
I feel this so much.  There's no telling how many magic guns I've scrapped because I didn't know what they were at the time.  Much sadness.
---
Perhaps the advance group that arrives plays all friendly with everyone to get the lay of the land and get their hooks in.
---
Later the main group arrives to start taking over everything and secure the silos etc. - at that point anyone who has proved properly useful to the advanced group is allowed to keep serving them while the rest are fodder.
---
That would make for an interesting storyline and provide a path for those who want to join them (Bootlickers!!!! ;-)  ) to do so.
---
She's the best fo76 youtuber I've come across
---
Not necessarily true
---
* Raider picks up a substantial amount of ammo and weapons to scrap.
---
* Commie one picks up lots of blood packs so you can craft stims and never run out
---
The scrap one can take or leave but still useful.
---
Most events seem to scale with number of players. So if you do Line in the Sand with the survival tent glitch. And you're solo. It'll only spawn like 3-4 scorched at a time. But if you have 5+ people there it spawns like 15-20 scorched at a time. I've noticed the same with Guided meditation. When you have like 6 people in the event it becomes chaotic.
---
It'd look cool with the secret service jetpack
---
I miss holstered weapons not bamffing into the X dimension
---
How much is a fixer?
---
Dude i can make nuka-shine it ain't a event award
---
Queue "Into the Lungs of Hell" \\m/
---
More complicated then that apparently, took modders a very long time to get it functioning well.
---
can range anywhere from 10k-30k i'd say
---
That is something I disliked about 4 and 76. Was it really *that* bad to show their models while holstered?
---
Even a non legendary one??
---
Hey you had my idea too! I’ve been a stealth commando for so long and made a new character to play heavy guns, but it’s just not fun for me to play on two characters and not be able to trade things between them. I’m hoping I’ll be able to max out legendary perks for specials and modify my build a bit to add more strength and intelligence to be a viable melee/heavy guns/shotgun/explosives character as well. Definitely opens up more options than just my pistols and rifles lol
---
I'm sure it will come.  They are very busy with season 2, treasure hunt event, daily ops, one wasteland, meat week second helping.  
---
Come to think there are a lot of things happening in the next month or two
---
They should add a fisto collectron that collects junk and a bunch of handcuffs
---
A fixer plan, however  is only about 8k to 10k. Once you learn that, you get a chance to roll fixers at mumbles
---
A non legendary fixer (item, not plan) is often free or at nominal cost.
---
Yep
---
I just want a Fixer plan
---
lmao feel ya
---
If I were the BOS, MODUS would be the first target. Too powerful of a "tool" with too much freedom to do what it wants. Wouldn't even be that hard, especially with a player turn-coat. Waltz in, drop a few more robots, and plant some powerful explosives on what remains of MODUS's brain. Pop goes the self-aware weasel, bent on nuking a relatively nice place into a desolate wasteland. Don't get me wrong, it certainly helped drop the SBQ (or at least draw her out), but it doesn't get any more sketchy than Enclave.
---
BOS has it's problems, but lets be real: we all know what the Enclave will become, looking at past games. At least the Brotherhood can be reasoned with.
---
I've had 3 or 4 people at guided meditation, still only 1 ghoul. We just jumped around on the highest point of the structure the whole time lol. It scaling would make sense and that seems to usually be the case but it's always the same whether I'm solo or with a group at guided meditation. I always wondered if it was supposed to be that way or not, good to know it's not though and it just is very glitchy or something
---
There we go lol
---
Yep check the season 2 list on the fallout events webpage
---
I thought so, but u/descendent1784 indicates otherwise in his [resource guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic).
---
It’s been a while since I actually when lead ore farming, since the route I use gets plenty of lead scrap daily. I might have to start adding in Lucky Hole mine again.
---
Id say it’s Super Heavy cause it outclasses all other armor by a long shot.
---
I miss fisto.
---
MODUS is logical.
---
The BOS is not.
---
I look forward to dropping orbital strikes on Atlas at will.
---
I would say you're more likely to find a decent heavy than a decent auto for that price range.
---
If you're worried about ammo I'd recommend an instigating gatling gun, you will 2 shot just about anything.
---
If you're not worried about ammo and use power armour , miniguns are your friend. Anti armour or two shot miniguns will slaughter everything. Vampires minigun is the closest you'll get to immortality.
---
At this point I’d take that. 
---
Things that can be made at a bench by 90% of the playerbase is really disappointing.
---
When you glitch into the mines without triggering the event each mine is treated as a separate instance so server hopping resets the mines
---
I know people don’t like this for some reason but considering there’s no control in what you get getting 100% 3stars doesn’t even change much. Also most of legendary effects suck.
---
If only we had an option for audio in our setting, oh wait...
---
but with Fallout that's kind of the point. I'm honestly surprised how many people take these things at face value.
---
Reckon a lot of F76ay not have played previous games.
---
What event is this? I'm a BoS fanboi
---
Got it- thanks. When I logged in this morning, it was nowhere to be seen. Now it’s available to me.
---
It’s the way of the industry . Game studios that are no longer independent don’t care about their fans or products . They have to be profitable and have growth  or are abandoned. It’s not the developers or workers fault as they are employees. Lots of studios get bought up and their gutted for their IP. They lay off the majority of their employees and are left with the barebones . Once those bones are turned to soup they close it. Rinse and repeat . Least the shareholders are happy 😃
---
It wouldn't influence the speed at which the... "reload" happens?
---
It’s just once each. Stop.
---
You could use the Ol' Reliable glassed caverns xp farm but you need a minimum of 2 people to start it
---
I will. Id like to see variety rather then a overwhelming amount of one faction. Communist and raiders has been done to death. Its stale. What we don't get is the stuff that fans are asking for over and over again (BoS and enclave). You have to ask yourself why is a developer who is clearly driven by microtran$action$ not giving what people are asking for. I haven't seen or heard anyone go "we need more commie shit".
---
Holy shyte, did not realize I am the proud owner of a legacy mod box, lol.
---
I love it. Highest armor rating in the game. Atomic onslaught paint looks sweet on it. So does next season's armor paint.
---
I see it a lot when I fast travel but it just repeats the last few legendary I received
---
There aren't too many fast-firing or automatic Pistols.  You've got the 10mm, the Pipe Pistol, the Laser Pistol, and the Plasma Pistol.  The 10mm tends to be the workhorse of the bunch.
---
DuchAss
---
Those did kinda add a menacing air to those weapons back in FO3&amp;NV didn’t they? You seen some dude with a Minigun and a backpack full of ammo and think “Shite he’s loaded for bear.”
---
im a lv. 222 heavy build with junkie heavy guns and personally if you have the resources to make a lot of 5mm ammo constantly then miniguns are a good choice. Gatling guns as well since they help use less 5mm ammo and I have an anti armor one and gets the job done. harpoons are garbage in my opinion unless you get a quad one then it's decent. .50s are the same with miniguns and worth it especially the last word gun you get from beketts ally quest. plasma casters and gauss miniguns are nice (rocking 3 gauss miniguns) however you need max rep with the raiders and 750 gold bullion to get the gauss mini itself with no mods and it eats ammo like any other mini and the plasma caster is nice too and ammo is cheap to make compared to the gauss, which can be obtained from the secret service people if you have 750 gold bullion as well with no mods. in a nut shell it all comes down to preference. my best advice is to start with a gatling gun and work your way with other heavies and find your playstyle honestly I.e a bloodied build, junkies, furious, ect.
---
If it does I’ve never noticed a big change. It’s a two or three second animation for cocking the bolt. 25% off of that still leaves time between each shot. It’s effective on an auto weapon because it will give a few more hits a second.
---
I see many non legendary Fixers for 500-1k caps.
---
I thought I read somewhere that those were just placeholders. I'll see if I can find the post...
---
I expected something that was not a reskin, something that would tie it into the BOS.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ihmk29/guided_meditations_meta/
---
Yup made a post recently abt this meta meditation thing as oddly appropriate
---
I see someone doesn't enjoy Wallace's *soothing voice*.
---
It really is freeing to jump from wherever the hell I want without putting on power armor.
---
Oh your right just not thier own people. I guess i havent gotten my reputation high enough to not get paid.
---
Are they max level at 45 or 50?
---
Yeah, for me it's XBox.  Ammo and serum begging mostly.  I stopped giving freebies because I ended up getting messages begging for more.  I already sell mega cheap at my vendor (5 cap recipes and 175 for serums) so go earn it and buy it.
---
Honest question:
---
Would you rather either caps, fireworks, gold, or scrip instead of the aforementioned craftable aid items?
---
I’m willing to wager you’d take the former instead of the latter if given a real choice.
---
I am 100% treating this chapter of the BOS as a hostile invading force.
---
When you finally clear out the adds, and start hammering on Earl, and then your gun stops firing, even though you've got 50 shots left, it may not be a HUGE deal, but it is a big deal.
---
So, technically there is no Nuka-Shine as a reward in *’The Legendary Run’*, but I get what you mean.
---
**Edit:** *Season 2 is called ‘The March of Freedom’, not ‘The Legendary Run’.  It was just a tongue-in-cheek joke, that apparently fell flat. My apologies.*
---
I’d personally prefer to see something like ‘Season Points’ for most of the non-cosmetic rewards. And those points can be spent for what the player specifically wants. 
---
I have no use for Scrap Kits or Repair Kits, for example. I’ve already got so many repair kits I’ll never use them all, and I’m not going to use the scrap kits at all, probably. 
---
But I’d be glad to exchange some of those for a Perk Card Pack, or some Gold Bullion, or even some Atoms. Even if there was a maximum amount available from each category, I’d rather get the currency or benefit I use instead of something that will probably get given away, like NukaShine.
---
You've seen the post everywhere because it is true, Bethesda has just never actually done it.
---
Closest was the dupe deletions in spr 2019 but that wasn't even a complete dupe removal, and it was soon enough after the game launched they could take that sort of action without massive backlash.
---
We are now nearly 2 years into the game and people have solidified strongly on their desired builds.
---
Meaning people have had 2 years to perfect their desired builds, and that usually involves to some small or large degree buying duped gear.
---
If Bethesda out of the blue decided they didnt like legacy gear anymore and cut it from the game, all of the people who have spent 1-2yrs perfecting their builds (yes largely with duped legacy gear) would be extremely pissed at work/effort gone out the window... it's only logical there would be a mass exodus of players who don't want to put the time, effort, or even $$$ into the game to restart their builds.
---
Deleting massive amounts of gear they don't like is something a game company does a few months after the game releases before people have had a lot of time to commit deeply to one build or another.
---
Deleting massive amounts of gear years after game launch when it has already been deeply integrated into player builds as meta gear is suicide to the game.
---
Oh it finds that stuff, but its delivering it to Atlas XD you get any scraps it finds along the way
---
&gt; MODUS is logical.
---
&gt;I look forward to dropping orbital strikes on Atlas at will.
---
I wonder if you see the irony.
---
Fast travel to summerville, pick up every book, globe and tool in the book House, server hop and go back to lucky hole, then the nodes will be there at least
---
😂👍
---
He's right. Your camp's dialectical materialism rating *IS* insufficient. It must be cleansed.
---
Have you ever dropped stimpaks in a bag because you have too many?
---
That’s why healthkits shouldn’t be in the rewards. We are even getting legendary perks that generate them.
---
How much is it and how long are they selling it
---
Is that not normal?  I've only played NW once, and it did take long time to load in, but had no other point of reference to compare it to
---
They can't just play the game?
---
Lol i find it funny that you were downvoted because you said they look like shit. Its almost like these downvoters can't handle opposing opinions. Smh
---
Tip: you can build them in workshops too. One extra power-free resource node
---
Logic dictates that technology will be necessary to rebuild the country. 
---
Hoarding that tech and keeping it out of the hands of the very people who are trying to rebuild is illogical.
---
See the irony?
---
It's a bolt action. You will find something better.
---
And that reason is why Bethesda will probably make the BOS HQ just like Crater and Foundation where you can’t kill anybody inside the city limits. Like the children in previous game’s, you shoot them and nothing happens.
---
I imagine there would be a lot of dead raiders and settlers if players were allowed to murder people in the main settlements.
---
(But yeah I’m totally expecting them to be bad too.)
---
Apparently it has to do with weapon modding but I don't see why they couldn't design them around it, weapons already change their grip when changed from rifle to pistol so that's not an issue.
---
Sad to admit, but I'm most overjoyed by the Master Infiltrator perk.  The idea of not swapping out those GD picklock cards ever again.....heaven.
---
After 2200 hours of gameplay, we have a lot of scrap.
---
Not the question. How can they get that many mats. Like I would find it hard to believe just playing the game and getting that much
---
Xbox?
---
Yea we run the same mutations as well, I taught him his build he used to run a heavy PA build and when he saw what my fixer did I got him a b2525 and he has the same exact build I do now, same mutations perks and chems
---
K
---
BOS collectron is free.
---
As of writing they are still up on the fallout events page. 
---
Add to the list nuclear keycards which I seem to trip over like missiles.
---
since heavy guns are under strength and auto rifles are under perception, I would pick one or the other and make your build work with whichever you choose. auto rifles would use the commando, expert commando, master commando, and tank killer cards...all maxed out that is 12 pts. in perception. heavy weapons use heavy gunner, expert heavy gunner, and master heavy gunner under strength, but also may want to use bullet shield under strength and if in power armor, stabilized under intelligence. other things to consider: heavy guns do not have silencers...sneak damage is double damage. using vats in power armor drains the fusion cores. heavy guns work best with power armor because of the stabilized card, do you want to be a power armor build? also if you are a perception build you can use a rifleman or a commando build by just switching out the cards. a strength build can easily swap from heavy guns to shotguns or melee. just need to decide what your build/playstyle will be going forward and make a character that suits you.

Goddamn robosexuals are going to ruin this country.
---
No you can trade a lot or play the game and just get it especially with fallout first you can hold unlimited junk
---
Holy balls that thing is creepy
---
Doesn't everyone get this outfit in the scorched one quest?
---
I was about to ask why we don't see any other 76s in the game until I read your comment and it hit me like a general gutsy bullet
---
Thanks for doing this. I did my own math where I estimate what each season is worth based on how much I would pay for items. Season 1 was 10,870 in value. Season 2 is slightly lower at 9,600
---
Fallout 1st gives you an infinite scrap box. Once you begin collecting and scraping absolutely everything in every event, quest, or area you clear, you start racking up materials quickly. I've had 1st for less than a week and I'm already over 5k steel.
---
50.
---
You might notice that I ***AGREED*** with you about the non-cosmetics that were chosen to be included in Season 2, and even gave a detailed example of what I would prefer to see, which would eliminate you or any other player from having to receive what you view as useless rewards.
---
Why look a gift horse in the mouth if someone gifts you more then you asked for and doesn't ask for anything in return you say 'Thank you kind sir/madam you're doing Mother Russia proud!'
---
Its pretty easily. Just grab and scrap. The survival tent really helps.
---
You play long enough with fallout 1st you will be surprised at how much you can drop. 1k isn’t outside the realm of possibility. Now if they can drop 10k willy nilly then you probably got a duper there
---
Well it adds 200 pounds to my storage
---
If the fix was turning off Super Duper for the Assaultron Heads, that was the exploit my guy.  
---
The change was adding this keyword to the item record:
---
BlockSuperDuperPerk \[KYWD:0043C439\]
---
As of writing - there’s a 12x nukashine being dropped at lvl 29 - it’s displayed on the season 2 page.
---
15th
---
I’ve heard all these before but from where? *cough* enclave *cough* seriously though it just makes the BOS sound like rip off enclave who’re just pissed about not having as nice of toys to play with
---
THIS SO MUCH. I literally just....dont open safes or terminals unless I have to for a quest lmao.
---
Aw man. Must have been an older post I saw, then. Slightly disappointing.
---
Bring it on!  I'll gladly fill those holier-than-thou SOBs with lead.
---
So? You never heard of paying it forward? Or maybe make a storage character? Better to have excess scrap and not need it then need it and not have it
---
Is that wait happened?  Because Super Duper has nothing to do with scrapping anything.  It has to do with crafting. That’s two different actions. 
---
So did Bethesda address scrapping Assaultron Heads or crafting Assaultron heads?
---
When it comes to a post-apocalyptic hellscape, where every faction both has to survive and have extreme ideals/ideologies to hold together, it's going to be hard to find anything \*but\* baddies the larger the faction becomes.
---
You can argue the Railroad are goodies, except they still coerce what are effectively mentally children (life experience-wise) taught/bullied into accepting orders and pressure into having their minds wiped, and then are dropped like a hot potato as soon as it is - leading to at least one example of them becoming a raider (Libertalia).
---
You could argue the Minutemen are goodies, except, we know that wasn't the case because it was in-fighting and betrayal that ultimately destroyed them, and many turned to raiding.
---
The only genuinely 'good' faction I can think of in the entire setting is the Followers of the Apocalypse, and they still 'gave birth' to the Legion in a sense. It's not their fault, I would argue, as it's just what Sallow chose to do with his education, but still.
---
Applying our real-word values to factions rather than trying to get into the head of our character and looking at them within the context of the franchise, like say an actor would, is asking for a bad time. In the end, it's usually the Brotherhood who turns up to try and resolve existential threats to humanity and deal with mad scientists. Are they elitist(/condescending to civilians) buttholes? Sure. But that doesn't inherently make them bad guys. They have been more of a benefit to the wastes than they have a threat.
---
I myself am tempted to take it
---
Bought it again 5 days ago and didn't have a problem.
---
Same. Was told to scrap it to learn the mod but ive been hesitant in doing so. Glad I didn't because that apparently doesn't work. Looks like I'll be holding onto mine for awhile.
---
I bet it is still score challenges, that award score for nothing. Either that or they have to turn off the daily/weekly system, which I seriously doubt.
---
It started having problems last night.
---
i've only had fo1st for 3 months and have like 5k or something. 
---
i collect everything and also buy a lot of junk from vendors.
---
Urban operative underarmour ;)
---
My gf usually has this problem after a crash. I’ll let her know about this next time it happens. Thanks!
---
We better get options to destroy them
---
Yes. And Season 2 is *not* **’The Legendary Run’**. 
---
It’s **‘The March of Freedom.’**
---
Nothing has beaten a good .50 cal for me
---
Google glassed caverns xp farm thank me later lol
---
What does the underarmor do?
---
Ah I get the Dorsey message too on PS4, but I just click X and it takes me to the select options since I own every other collectron.
---
I know the farm im level 3 tho
---
If it’s not going to be Atoms (which is my guess and a logical assumption), I’d love to see it award something like Perk Coins to prepare us for Patch 22.
---
I rock a vampires explosive right now. But its only level 35. Still a tank for me though
---
and also consider the ammo factor. heavy gun build uses 5mm, .50 cal and .308 (or fusion/plasma cores for energy guns). auto rifle (commando) build uses .45, .38, and 5.56 (fusion cells/plasma cartridges for energy guns). how good are you at crafting ammo? can you craft 3-5k rounds of ammo today if you need to? An old school crank handle gatling gun is very efficient if you have issues with ammo. fires slow, hits hard, and supermutants with miniguns drop 100 rounds of 5mm.
---
I have a seperste account is it able to be done solo?
---
What lvl is your friend?
---
Yup this is true, I used the Fasnacht collectron since I’m camped out at Helvetia but I had it collecting scrap from the normal bot. He got the boot for the BOS one though lol
---
1 Mineral extractor can net you 50-100 per play session. So a few days of collecting, plus super duper when you refine, and 1K copper is pretty easy to do. That isn't even counting passive farming while picking up junk to scrap. Especially if it is a resource you rarely use. I have a ton of ballistic fiber in my stash box because I run PA and never use it.
---
? I'm looking for someone to help me?
---
You need 2 ppl to start it or 2 separate accounts
---
Well, ammo for 10 caps a piece... I'll pass!
---
:-)))
---
The game already allows you to do this yourself. It's free to fast travel to public events, where you will likely find said high levels doing the event. Shoot the things they shoot, it's the fastest way you'll level.
---
Plus 3 strength, adds 15 carry weight
---
k
---
I figured
---
No no no , all ammo is 0
---
Oh it’s worth having 100%
---
I don't know if this works on console, but there is a trick for single shot weapons that need to be chambered after each shot on PC.
---
Aim down sight and shoot
---
Sprint forward 
---
Shoot as you sprint
---
If you get good at it, you can fire two shots off at the same time.
---
If you shoot, then just *hit* aim twice, you will no longer be slowed down while you rack the weapon.
---
God speed.
---
gotcha ill try it out thanks
---
K thanks
---
Why have more than 1-star legendaries? Just make all 1 star with a chance to drop a 2 or 3 star item.
---
At this point im starting to believe they dont want us to playbthe game anymore
---
As an alternative you could join pub teams for events and just tag everything if you dont get kicked lol
---
Communist has the best herbivore food, healing items and purifierirf water. It gives enough that I don’t need to collect food or water any other way
---
It probably wouldn't go to well but you can try watoga if you dont mind death
---
I’m just glad to get a good looking scout skin, it doesn’t get near as much love as it should. Looking forward to then adding an all black skin for it eventually.
---
yeah forgot they added those
---
I’m on mobile going in and out of service so didn’t get a chance to edit after I reread. 
---
Yes your method would work better then how it is right now. 
---
but they also aren’t gonna be instituting a new system this close to launch.
---
They could however swap out the HealthKit and nukashine and keycards for fireworks gold caps or scrip or any of the other more palpable things.
---
That would be really cool, and a smart move! So, sadly I doubt Bethesda will do it, especially without letting us all know beforehand. We can hope...
---
Alright thanks. So i should just wait?
---
I know it’s an unpopular opinion, but I feel the fact that a 3* can drop lower tiers is fair. Hear me out: most of the legendary I come across as a level 175 are 3* and if every one of those dropped a 3* legendary I’d be loaded. I feel that the 3* is a way of saying “the upper bound of the amount of effects you can get on the item”. You have a high chance of getting one but you don’t always get it. It’s a subtle way of balancing the value of legendary enemies.
---
Yes! It works now! On PC, hit "Enter" and the terminal will take you to the scavenge options.
---
I don't think they're good guys. One single chapter in 200 years decided to make helping people over acquisition a priority, and didn't they essentially get kicked out for it? With prejudice? If the bear that eats my brahmin also eats the raiders that steal my crops, I'm still shooting the fucking bear. He doesn't get a pass for taking my cows because he accidentally helped me out in the course of serving himself. Stopping the Master, the Calculator, preventing mutant armies from established resources, these were all necessary to save themselves. It was something that had to be done in order for them to continue to exist in those areas, was completely strategic and would have been attempted regardless of any local populations. I won't deny that everyone else benefits, and they do provide valuable services (*if* you're of a limited 'desirable' social class), but they're still institutionalized xenophobic thieves, and chaotic neutral at best.
---
U should buy a lotto ticket with luck like that!
---
They’ve said that how they handle seasons will be a work in progress. My guess is that if they see feedback about Health Kits and NukaShine not being well-received, they’ll adjust for next time. 
---
There *might* be some players that do like those rewards. Which is why I’ve been a proponent of a ‘Reward Shop’ for months now.
---
BOS doesn't hoard *all* technology, just *dangerous* technology. 
---
Seriously doubt they'd be interested in the Fusion Generators that power a few simple turrets in a settlement or C.A.M.P., but maybe some interest in, you know, **the nukes that literally anyone can launch at any given time for any given reason at any given target.** The ones that are **exclusively used on Appalachian soil, where we are all currently trying to scrape out a living**. The ones that MODUS is more than happy to help you launch in any way that it can, mostly because it can't do so itself due to programming. Pity for the poor, genocidal AI.
---
BOS is human-based, potentially with some of it's middle-aged members being alive pre-war. To be clear, the war I'm talking about is the one where the Enclave ran and hid from the nukes and subsequently were wiped out due to in-fighting (oh, and MODUS).
---
So... no. I don't see any irony in the BOS trying to save humanity at large from itself. I *do* see the irony in an Enclave fanboy singing the praises of all-mighty logic while getting so offended they threaten a mass bombing. Seems a bit emotional, doesn't it?
---
Don't worry. MODUS won't feel a thing when that plug gets pulled... unless one of the scribes can figure out how to make him feel something, then we're in business.
---
I think it's technically sturdy.
---
Only if they're communist.
---
I would use it but since I know only one lock and computer that  is worth it for me to hack in the game I prob pass for now. Even that one if I ignore I have to just run around for two extra minutes
---
The last time someone tried to pull MODUS' plug, they all got gassed to death.
---
All of you BOS fanboys amuse me - I guess it takes a bit more imagination to dare to be different.
---
I fucking love it.
---
I thought the same thing too when I saw Nukashine... I thought “Wtf I still have like 60 in my bag from the Treasure Hunter Event.”
---
Thanks man
---
&gt; Because I have not personally seen ppl asking for it, it must be that no one ever does.
---
I'm a fan. Why not flesh out the other side of the Great War?
---
Bethesda isn't endorsing the ideas they portray in their games. It's a product, pump the brakes on that conspiratorial thinking.
---
And if you’re willing to sacrifice 10 weight just carry around a set of excavator with calibrated shocks, easy 200 extra weight
---
Definitely going to have to try and hit you up in the next few days. I've been slacking with plans for a while but I wanna try and get back into trying to collect them all
---
oops
---
Scrap
---
at level 3 just go to Morgantown trainyard and airport, plenty of enemies there and work benches and a train station. get yourself 100 caps or so and run west to gorge junkyard, claim it and defend it. you'll be level 10 before you know it! and watch for the leader of the pack event that spawns at the ferris wheel top left. whenever you see it, go do it. and hopefully along the way you'll meet someone to play with? and if you are on xbox, i'll be on later tonight.
---
The monorail elevator, it has the best view in the game at the top.
---
I disagree. If that happened, what will current high level players, with end game gear do with their current weapons and armor? Just grind for higher level gear that they already have? Unless, Bethesda added a way to ‘upgrade’ weapons and armor to make them higher level? Lots of people have talked about this already many times. Lots of players, Including myself, have had good to great weapons/armor, drop from low level enemies. Making them pretty useless. Anyway, I hope they don’t add higher level gear. Just my opinion.
---
I'm more worried about the fact it was Dorsey who programmed it, i thought he was nice guy too.
---
Stable flux counts as scrap, yes. Scrapboxes will not hold hardened masses, however, without scrapping them into ultracite. So, you can horde stable flux in your scrapbox, but stabilizing materials will remain in your stash.
---
nice
---
Stable flux is junk and can go in first box.
---
Don’t know how much you need, but can come in handy if you prime a weapon.
---
I'm a little bit confused, what do we do after we add the mule to our friends list? Do we invite them to a team or wait until the mule joins a server?
---
Turn on pacifist mode.
---
sorry i even tagged ps4 :(
---
To be fair, the last ones who tried to pull MODUS' plug were also Enclave, so they were bound to fuck it up. But *man* are they different from the BOS... in that they always fail.
---
Turn in legendaries and try your luck at the purveyor?
---
I am always in pacifist mode..
---
Damn, left the server the vendor was on.
---
Fixed it for you
---
Other things?   You can continue to use your scrap box after your 1st subscription expires, and it’ll only select items from there if none exist in your inventory or regular storage (so if you only do the sub for a month - go junk crazy)
---
you vendor the missing plans by chance?
---
Get to Radiation Rumble to make ammo, and find a scavenger using the bench? Grrr.
---
They addressed crafting for the purpose of scrapping. A lot of patch notes lines are ambiguous and we've been begging them to stop writing like that.
---
same i can entirely relate when i was around that lv. and now as a 222 im ready to settle down on only a junkies build with heavy guns lol 😄
---
So I guessing this revolves around the perk that lets you pick extra special points, does it have enough leeway to allow you to pick other perks or do you need to go all out in it?
---
dang didn't see the tag...good luck to you!
---
The **optics** of it all make it so goddamn hard to ever truly get people to play once they leave or if they had doubts from “bag-gate.”
---
It’s stupid AF but here we are.
---
Edit: to whomever You can downvote me for mentioning the godforsaken bag issue- but it remains in peoples minds and shit like this brings it up every time.
---
Agreed, awesome. What did you use to build it?
---
If its a popular spot some ppl destroy stuff trying to force you off a server
---
I ain’t gay, but 10,000 atoms is 10,000 atoms my guy.
---
I like the coffee table railing idea! I’m surprised you didn’t hit a build limit after that
---
Sorry to be the harbinger of stupid news but here we are. 
---
Stay safe out there
---
To collect? It’s free?
---
Probably best to join the mule. Easiest to message the mule owner and check though
---
Sort of, but not really. Santiago wasn't Enclave &amp; if her men hadn't tried to blow up MODUS &amp; instead just captured or killed President Eckhart, MODUS would have deferred to Santiago as the ranking military member.
---
But, they did &amp; MODUS acted out of self-defense. In the context of 2077 America, it was completely logical.
---
And it's completely within the realm of possibility that patriotic Vault 76 residents, upon finding MODUS &amp; the resources of the Bunker, would have been keen to restart the Enclave.
---
No it's not a popular spot
---
Actually still have a little space left
---
Its uh.. a bit underwhelming tbh. Mine collects 2 wooden scraps and 1 piece of concret an hour. And 3 Radaways. I might splurge for the raider one now.
---
Can you cite when they have stolen from settlers outside either the off-the-books quest in FO4 that Danse disapproves of if you do steal or during the Scorched crisis where they needed said supplies to keep everyone alive? A lot of people treat them like bandits, but I've never seen a good example of them doing this. Even the Outcasts in FO3 will defend you and other wastelanders, for no benefit to themselves, while patrolling.
---
I also feel like you are applying antagonistic and aggressive motivations to them where none necessarily exists.
---
Lol, I won't kill the messenger. Thanks for the information!
---
God no. I don’t want to re-grind all my gear.
---
That's definitely not a Screaming Eagle skin we supposed to get. This is just a renamed Blood Eagle skin from season 1.
---
https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/1YnwVGs4VG5aw2rJimTNKv/7fcfc75493613810178c63ad198ec5ca/SCORE_S1_Skin_WeaponSkin_HandmadeGun_BloodEagle_L.png
---
I'm long past the point, when such moves on their part could surprise me though. Typical Bethesda. They all about bait-and-switch these days.
---
This is nice, although it sucks that I will not be able to get the Thunderpipe skin (I'm okay with it, the skin just rocks), though I guess that's on me for only getting 76 last month.
---
No not heard anything like that.
---
Raw flux and inert flux are aid items
---
Stable flux is considered junk.
---
S such, if you are carrying stable and you die, it drops alongs with whatever other jun you had at the time, (and is subject to retrieval by another player)
---
Have you considered then that either A) you pissed someone off somehow or B) its just random ppl being asshats cause they can?
---
Are you on Xbox? I can craft it for you
---
Attack....... RUN AWAYYYYYYY
---
Got home to 3 scorchbeasts absolutely wrecking my shit the other day, logged off to lick my wounds and salvage what I could.
---
Ah, a proud turd! You do you turdman!
---
PLEASE
---
The card is in the upstairs office, there might be more than one.
---
Well 90% of high level players just use dupped weapons.. 50% of players have mules full of legacys and other weapons that i think shouldnt be in the game anymore. With adding higher level weapons could make the game feel refreshed, giving u that feeling u earned something again like destiny does.
---
Thank you! Mostly concrete, steel and wood
---
I am. How much you want for it?
---
maybe they are closing.. and servers are going offline one by one?
---
So you're mad that one of the dozens of free rewards isn't up to par?
---
talk about gamer entitlement. jesus....
---
Just being able to see groups of people come together to defeat bosses of do events. Seeing the whole server tackle the SBQ is awesome.
---
Games do this to pad out their content, it's not a fun mechanic. Level 100 enemies aren't any harder to kill than level 70 we have now. Adding new weapons and fixing armor so that it's not like wearing toilet paper would be much more fun.
---
I have been pondering just this. If I get it for a month, farm materials and stable flux like crazy for one month, then I could be setup for quite some time. Inventory management is really killing me. I have legendaries piling up that I can't scrip, so I'm throwing away scrap to make room because I don't have enough plastic to bundle it and sell it. Ugh, what a pain. But there is that part of me that still says, "don't give Bethesda one more red cent."
---
I've had mine set to 'proletariat' for quite a while because I was told there's a unique recipe it can collect, but no luck for me so far :(
---
Maybe your CAMP is near a random encounter
---
Still not fixed. Look at your first sentence in the body of your post.
---
I’m almost level 300 and I’ve been the same bloodied commando/melee build since Lvl 90. I have over 80 un used special point re assigns. I just hit double XP weekends and do hella queen runs during.
---
oh no, a non legendary you should be able to get your hands on pretty easily
---
Come with us, it is time. We must reset everyone back to the stone age so you may grind lvl 100 gear. 
---
Muahahahaha 
---
This is the most evil thing i could think of.
---
Come to my camp tonight and I’ll craft you whatever you want that I have for free :)
---
A better idea would just put a hard cap on stats - like 20, for instance.
---
200 caps
---
It's seems like an oversight that they don't have a Doom flavored skin for the double barrel shotgun. I'm trying to cleanse the wasteland of its demons!
---
Critical miss
---
It’s not a bug it’s a feature.
---
my problem with this lowbie was that he was melee build (if i remember correctly he hand a baseball bat, a baton, or a fireman's axe) if he was ranged i most likely wouldn't had much to gripe with. tactic i would be ok with is shot, aggro, then run keeping them of the rest of use (the meat shield) would still get the exp when some one kills the spawns. &lt;this is my flawed approach. he might have been doing that as a melee build but just letting them swarm him instead
---
Awesome.
---
If the next season pass ends up the same way im skipping it , it's just not worth the time hell i might skip this season too
---
Do you have turrets?
---
Didn’t say it was a Bug? Just don’t understand
---
That’s my point. The patch note is ambiguous. We can make a logical assumption about what they *meant* to say, but that’s separate from what they *did* say. 
---
On a side note, no one is going to get banned for using Super Duper. You and I both know that.
---
I'd be careful painting high level players with such a wide brush there....
---
The only time I shoot friendlies in the back of the head. Well, that and when im unhappy, or they look at me funny, or they come at me with a bottle. Ill kill a friendly with a bottle, that shit could kill you.
---
Have you noticed anyone near your camp, are you taking workshops at all. Seems odd. Is the entire camp completely destroyed ? Can't say my camps have been destroyed since they made changes with the mechanics, I have had grahm attack my camp when my turrets when off at him and definitely some damage due to scorch and events. Even my camp in the bog suffers mild damage due to a scorch event that happens. 
---
if it is happening again and again, I would say has to be critters of some sort or a bug that hasn't saved ..
---
Eventually, we'll probably see 4\* &amp; 5\* Legendaries....level-wise? Probably not or who knows?
---
It was a joke. A corporate way to say everything is working as intended don’t worry!
---
There ya go.
---
Some of my best purchases have been from random people. One dude had 300+ maps, and when I started requesting them he just started listing them all for 0 caps. Some other random sold me an ultracite targeting HUD plan for 250 or whatever the list price is.
---
It never hurts to look and throw out a request.
---
As a level 547, I wonder if I scare low level players when I walk by (like legit, I do wonder).
---
I understand your intention. But first...5 more lvls wouldn't make a difference. And second...magic wwepons are still around. It's would just solve nothing. Before doing a drastique move like that ( let's say...adding 10 or 15 more lvls ) they need to fix duping and magic weapons. Otherwise history will just repeat itself.
---
But yea, if they can fix this...as a Bloodied Heavy Gunner near lvl 300...I'll be ok to take the drop for the well of the game. 
---
Honestly it would be a good strat if they can't actually find and ban those op weapons.
---
Don't get me wrong...i'd be really really pissed. But honestly, it would be the thing to do...
---
I've never played doom. Would you recommend it? I've heard a lot about it but I'm in 2 minds
---
Lol. It’s more about:
---
1.	The mobile game-esque optics it presents to potential or previous players - everyone I shared the season 2 rewards page with had huge 👀 at the health kit and wouldn’t let it down. 
---
2.	The potential further dilution of the next seasons reward and increased filler rewards 
---
3.	They said they would adjust things based on feedback and critique. This is that feedback and critique. Sorry if it’s not sweet as you’d like.
---
Secret service armor
---
Is 20 really your idea of balanced when other special stat increases are only single digits at best and basically have no purpose other than to be discarded more often than not in favor of unyielding?
---
The whole point is to bring unyielding down to balanced level and having other stat choices be useful.
---
Why is it a good idea to max out PAST what you can manually put special points into for a max of 15? Maybe 8-10 at most.
---
I don't know from experience, but I have seen people with jetpacks and regular armor, so I think you can get one without power armor.
---
Could be lots of things depending on what platform it was on eq they had vs your eq etc etc etc to many variables to say really
---
Ahhhh... over my head, sorry 😐
---
No. There's an armor set in the game that can have a jetpack attached and isn't Power Armor. Are you concerned with spoilers?
---
Were you Vatsing him for hits? Vats is bugged, will not do  damage in pvp.
---
Yeah, hoping they're more like Lyon's Pryde rather than douches in F4.
---
IMHO, Weight wise, it is light or med.  DR wise, it is heavy.
---
reasoning: my heavy metal chest weighs 12, SS chest weighs 7.
---
Idk the weights on the limbs, other than lighter. Buttressed, they have a dr of 54, whereas heavy metal is 45.
---
DR wise, the full heavy metal set has about 330, buttressed SS pieces are  about 340.and ss has 3x the rr and at least 2x the er.
---
Yes, was using Vats
---
Secret Service armor (the end of the vault 79 storyline, plus the cost of gold for the torso plan and jet pack plan)
---
In the whitespring bunker there is a display case with a mini gun in it. I wonder if it would work on that?
---
Scrap collectron brings Springs, screws, and Ultracite
---
if you were using vats, then the damage number will show, but not actually do any damage with most guns. if you were not using vats then could be a situation where the wanted played drank a bunch of quantum's. may have still been possible to kill the player with a melee weapon that has a bleed effect. and of course this is fallout 76, so.....
---
For me, I had Steam credit already.  So I’ve benefited from the 1st and getting the extra atoms helps.  
---
Although, with the whole team aspect now; there is less incentive for me to want to go on a private server.  
---
If caps are an issue, I’d suggest trying to find a plan for a rare outfit or helmet (insurgent, marine armor eg) and you can sell those to vendors for up to 25 caps if you have the perks and grape mentats.  I haven’t bothered to bulk sell items since I’ve had the 1st sub
---
Also, if you’re trying to do something obscure like tame a pet - being able to server hop from public to private is really useful.  Also, being able to farm certain areas like looking for Asylum outfits; having a private server helps
---
What a roller-coaster of a post.
---
I say we let them in but keep tabs on them, use whatever gear and training we can squeeze out of them, and snuff them out if they get uppity. Unless they turn out like Lyon's faction; then they get a bit of a pass.
---
Well, the Bloodied crowd screams bloodie (sic) murder every time anyone suggests any changes to their build, weapons or armor.
---
Capping the effects of Unyielding would be a start. I'd also be in favor of using 15 as the cap as well.
---
It's a place to start the conversation.
---
Nooope haha
---
Gt is ju1c3itup. I'm game :)
---
I wold be happy if they just replaced them with lunchboxes tbh
---
If it's on PC, he's probably cheating. ; )
---
Yup, just like my time with the atoms. Starts off crazy happy cause you have 3.2 Million atoms then absolute disappointment when I get punished for reporting the issue.
---
There are no plans.
---
You have to buy the individual mods from MODUS in the Military Wing.
---
Secret Service armor.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service_armor
---
The chest can have a jetpack "mod" attached to it. Note that you aren't immune to fall damage while using this, but you are when you are in Power Armor.
---
Sorry, it’s on Xbox... clarified 👍🏼
---
Thanks everyone!
---
I've been holding off on finishing vault 79 cuz I'm slowly upping my rep with both factions.
---
The Secret Service Armor Chest piece will accept a Jet Pack Mod. It costs a ton of gold to get (the jet pack alone is 2000 gold).
---
Worth every penny.
---
Ah, ok, thanks!
---
Yeah. If it was easier to get through that would be one thing but it’s an absolute chore riddled with unfixed bugs that set you literally weeks behind and so people get intense about a lacklustre return on their time investment.
---
Doom (2016) is pretty damn awesome! It's fast paced but has a really nice flow and rewards you for being aggressive. When you've killed all the demons in the area you can explore and find all the secrets. I haven't played Doom Eternal yet (back catalog is big) heard that was good as well but its more in your face.
---
no plans, just mods for sale in the white springs bunker (enclave bunker) armory that is only accessible after you become a general in the enclave. best material mod is polymer and will be around 1400 caps, other mod (sleek, stabilized, ultra-light, etc.) will be around 500 caps.
---
And i have a quite good arsenal. I have all the weapons i need to switch to a Junkie build. I've been working toward this for months. I'd...be...pissed....
---
But it would be ok...
---
Yep. There’s another one of those events coming up too 😂
---
One is nice
---
Always funny, I love going through a group of ghouls just slaying a path though, constant rag dolls ftw.
---
Really?? WTF! add that as another definite reason for me to not PvP 🤣🤣
---
Moar fireworks pls 
---
^(Just because lunchboxes will be available for gold soon apparently)
---
Keep in mind one wasteland may drop on Sept 15 or something. 
---
Power leveling won't exist after that. Best hurry.
---
Wow, that’s F^ed up
---
Thanks, I am a general, I guess I was not in the correct wing when I was looking. Think I was only in the science wing
---
What’s your rate on copy editing lol
---
Yours and mine both
---
I hear people complain about this game constantly at work. (I work in electronics at a certain red shaped store) I like 76 and the people who hate on it either one never played it two played once back when it first came out. I honestly don't get people.
---
You're going to want to install this mod since you're on PC. 
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
There is never enough lunchboxes
---
whats dropping?
---
No charge, friend. It was just a silly joke on my part, nothing more. Sorry if it came across wrong.
---
Thanks btw 👍🏼
---
Or on the contrary
---
“I would say that you are a *prime* example of a human”
---
Thanks 👍🏼
---
Stay safe out there!
---
Lol touché
---
Good. I hope so. I really enjoy killing those Brotherhood assholes.
---
That is always going to happen with nerfs you have to keep your eyes on the bigger picture, the whole point of my post is to fix the balance of itemization.
---
My version of unyielding i think some would admit is actually better for surviving fights and fit the theme of unyielding better. While still allowing it to be a decent equip for non bloodied builds and bloodied both.
---
Just no more insane increases to the point where you are maxing out on the intelligence exp boost at intelligence 40. Why would you equip anything else when one effect is that powerful and has many different utilities considering it increases agility(AP) luck(crit rate) CHR(selling)etc.?
---
Having a max of 15 for both individual special stat increases and unyielding would be okay if individual increases allowed more card equips which would make things more balanced and give a reason for players to not increase every stat in that slot..
---
It would be very hard if not impossible to find a armor with unyielding and special stat increase to keep things balanced. Maybe 4 and 5 star armors.
---
Can I earn the “elder” tier reward on my 5 characters every day? Or just one each day?
---
just plan ahead so you don't end up with extra mods or ones you won't use. and you'll notice they are specifically for arms/legs/torso when buying the polymer mod.
---
But in workshops they'll use their skin's dafault program with no ability to switch, so do be choosy there
---
Legacy weapons are treated as if they don't exist because at the end of the day they don't matter on any real sense, the reality is that this isnt a pvp game on a realistic sense, the damage you deal in PVE doesn't really matter to other players the only issue with legacies is those who want them and don't have them/aren't willing to trade into them being upset they can't get them but the damage they deal means very little to others as its just a player having an easier time then you. Magics are a problem solely for the fact they prevent players from getting rewards and ruin the play experience for others, this is not a legacy problem. The fix for legacies was the Gauss series as they deal scaled explosive damage that everyone can earn so there is the fix. Gauss minigun, shotgun, rifle and pistol explosive energy weapon for each weapon class that are still available to all
---
Can I get some quotes please?
---
Don’t sweat it too much. I get people that have followed me and downvoted my comments, and laughed about it in DMs. It’s amusing.  I’d prefer a discussion rather than a random downvote because it makes them feel like they had some influence. 
---
But I’ve got your back. I’ll balance out the troll votes. ;). Upvotes away, lol!
---
Thanks for the tips! About to go log in as soon as episode 3 of The Boys is over
---
I lived in Excavator for a long time.  (bad collector habit).  
---
Now I have deep pocket WR armor (one each for ammo, aid, junk, and weapons) with AP regen, and a high capacity backpack :)
---
"I like you better when I am drunk" "Get out of my way."
---
Im having same issue on xbox too any ways to fix it ?
---
Read more on bethesdas website or this sub. You'll find it.
---
I like the idea of not tying unyielding to low health...the +2 to stats is pretty good (up to the max of 15), except for Endurance (to keep that intact).
---
You would have a lot of trouble using "armor" to gain the use of perk cards, however, because what happens when you take the armor off?
---
I think that needlessly complicated your idea - you go with the first part and I think you've got an idea with legs.
---
I just want my carry weight
---
Hahahahaha thanks comrade or patriot or fellow whatever you prefer
---
The Raider collectron is the best collectron.
---
He means spending levels reallocating SPECIAL points instead of taking perk cards, so they have fewer cards to scrap compared to someone of the same level who didnt reallocated SPECIAL points.
---
TIL. I stick to the raider one, should I buy another?
---
They should make pocketed its own mod slot and let us equip what resistance we want boosted for our armor. 
---
No reason to equip other special stat increase items when unyielding does everything.
---
It is extremely easy to shoot them down to 1hp and then just bash them with your gun.
---
I think having level 100 mole rats that can see through stealth and appear behind a player to one shot them will have more people play at the threshold for +2 bonus. That and nerd rage only being useful for the AP bonus and 10 extra damage.
---
To anyone thinking about trying NW on PS4
---
Be a bush wookie.
---
Fallout player discovers BoS not actually good guys, despite what Fallout 3 wants you to believe
---
I want to like the mode but it takes so long to get a game. I tried it for the first time last week and was immediately put off by how long the wait was and the fact that you can't jump onto a new game without backing up to the main menu.
---
Ash piles created by legacy weapons cause massive lag and they litally one shot everything so others don't get to tag enemies. On top of that, I have 3 dozen legacies so I'm not ranting cause I don't have one. And legacies work very well as magic weapons if you want to cheese magic damage as much as possible, legacies are a way to go. You must also acknowledge almost all hacked weapons are based on legacy effects, which make them even bigger problem
---
Theres already oversaturation of these items. They just released a bunch of it in atom shop and now a 3 month event of this crap. Im not against having communist stuff im against the flood of it. Especailly when overwhelming amounts of players have been asking for bos and enclave stuff in the atom shop since the very begining. Also theres a "Please give us more communist items" reddit post with a whopping 4 upvotes. Yes i did say "Nobody wants it" and should've said majority doesn't. Thats me putting words in your mouth which wasn't right for me to do. Im just looking for more variety from bethesda. Even raiders has been oversaturated. Enclave has no representation in atom shop besides that 1 beret. Like i said 3 times now though, if you like it by all means enjoy it.
---
Sometimes I trade plans I have in multiples, but rarely for caps.
---
I’m gonna start drinking them when I’m over encumbered and hopping it teleports me to some place near a stash box. I’m not an unarmed build so I’ve got no other use for them lol
---
i have this issue constantly with merchants spawning into my camp and having to walk away a far enough distance just to make them walk else where without them making dialogue lines toward me 😑
---
Confirm, met up with u/Funereal-Grief on PS4. Got bunch of pics of his stash on trade screen. Thanks! Now I can get grinding
---
You watch far too much Jim Sterling lmao.
---
Its not a conspiracy to "water down" the rewards. 
---
Its not them disrespecting you, stop being so easily offended over a video game. When you use language like that, its hard to take you seriously.
---
There was tons of crappy filler rewards in the first season. Acting offended at the two worst  really just makes you look petty.
---
So you are saying i should just get rid of the armor/survivability part and just go with special stat increases?
---
Also you don't unequip your amour that much so it could be somewhat feasible that certain cards will be highlighted when in your perk card menu showing it's only equipped due to armor, then when that armor piece breaks or taken off the card gets removed until you fix the armor.
---
I definitely dropped my junk a couple times during ACP once, but I almost always have a workshop, too. This would make sense to me.
---
I turned around once &amp; swear there were at least 50 of those damn things between me and the exit.
---
Yes ! Laser turrets
---
Oh I’ve known they weren’t always the good guys since New Vegas, Maxon in Fallout 4 just solidified that feeling.
---
How much are you charging in your vending?  I've seen people post that they destroy camps if they think the person is charging to much.   Like it's their responsibility to "teach a lesson".   In reality, the lesson will be taught by no one buying overpriced wares; I think it's just an excuse.
---
why are you trying to leave?
---
there's screws and ammo to be got
---
It appears to collect the items needed to complete BoS requests.... they should’ve given the collectron to us first week.
---
or instead of playing fallout you could watch ridley scott's raised by wolves when the boys is over. haha. i finished the legendary run and have all this free time now!
---
You don’t have to escape. It doesn’t affect your reward.
---
Meh, few of them look ok. Better than the PA skins but I'm only really interested in the camp rewards from the season.
---
“You’ll never have hopes of joining the brotherhood with muscles like that.”
---
Which, mind you, he even said to my friend with 10+ strength.
---
Holy fuck.  Instead of simply tying it to level like every sensible post here, they cobble together a completely half-baked token gesture that results in *exactly* the same disparity between people who reallocated points and people who did not, and most people lap it right up.
---
This community has Stockholm Syndrome REAL bad.
---
Pokemon Centres have an electronics section?
---
You could still incorporate a DR / ER increase at low health...since Vanguard does it at high health. It's not that big of a deal, since overall DR / ER gets pretty pointless once you have more than 350 of each.
---
Overall though, I do believe you're putting together a solid idea.
---
I escaped before the robots did anything to my coworkers.
---
Lyons's brotherhood was a complete failure, if he didn't die of cancer I guarantee the Eastern brotherhood wouldn't exist anymore
---
I forgot the holotape the first time around.
---
I’ve not heard of the show, will have to check it out
---
I would love to visit missing a few would love to double check what I'm missing and maybe donate some extras I have.
---
Sweet 🤙
---
Fisto is great, but Rose can be my robot romance over him any day.
---
Hello! I would like to come visit when you have a chance. Thank you for all you do :-)
---
i like to think that the brotherhood collectron sneaks into atlas late at night and steal crates of supplies
---
Do you take your fascism in classic flavor or technofascist flavor
---
So when will you guys reinstate his F1st subscription? He could’ve easily kept quiet but as a result of reporting this bug he has had all of his atoms wiped (legitimate and non-legitimate), all of his wallpapers removed AND his Fallout 1st sub revoked. 
---
If that doesn’t scream good customer service I don’t know what does...
---
Red shaped?
---
Did everything taste purple for a second?
---
Spoilers, but a lot of BoS stuff is already on the PTS (just in the files, not playable).
---
&gt;!Only three of them made it from Cali, they picked up some people along the way, and Russell got to join on the spot. They're suspiciously not reestablishing contact with Maxson after losing it, and the Paladin seems like a Lyons in spirit.!&lt;
---
Junkie build, I'm too lazy to keep my rads and health in their place for a bloodied build lol, I just let healing factor do that for me.
---
Didn't know Serendipy could prevent lethal fall damage, that's actually amazing.
---
He had me at "I wonder what human flesh tastes like?"
---
Well, as a proud cannibal let me elaborate for you...
---
Sure! My psn is Funereal-Grief 
---
Just send me a friend request, then send me a message on psn when you see me online :)
---
You do realize that unyielding doesn't have any defense bonuses, right? That's bolstering...
---
I will have to get on later to get it then
---
All it needs is a collectron that offers to "Let me show you my junk. Baby."
---
Welp. Well there are some concerning leaked holotapes from lab 6-9 of your old research job
---
I have no idea, and that annoys me.  I've only spent about 5 or 6 points reallocating.  But I opened all my perk packs up until a month ago or so (playing since shortly after release) because I didn't realise until then that duplicates got removed.  I have absolutely no clue how many I've lost.
---
Atomshop says available for 2 days.
---
Greaser protectron? Honestly, that sounds pretty good. Not sure what it would give, though.
---
Thanks see ya around.
---
Only if you explode if shot when wearing the flamer backpack, immersion you know.
---
You know the bone meal is loaded into a different chamber from the other three chemicals, yes?
---
Let's just say that it's a difficult topic. The Unyielding set really put the game in a difficult situation.
---
Right off the bat, the Unyielding armor set put Bloodied builds in a really great spot as they can get over +15 intelligence (30 and more ! ). 
---
To make it sort Bloodied builds can lvl up much faster than any other builds. And with the addition of the season passes and ESPECIALLY with the addition of the legendary perks...grinders will absolutly want an Unyielding armor set !
---
I mean...i'm no more playing in my power armor. It's just unproductive. I also really would like to go Junkie...but it seems that i'm just better stay on my Bloodied heavy gunner build.
---
It's a difficult topic for sure !
---
The special points still stay at max 15? That's a shame, I was hoping it could add to it.
---
Those weren’t my labs, those were Stevens. How that man wasn’t arrested is beyond me.
---
Explosive energy guns are good.
---
funny enough I've watched someone send off a nuke to trigger the event only to have the mine on the edge of the circle zone just enough to not trigger it and when everyone got there, we all emoted question marks till someone actually went and targeted the whole area instead to re-trigger it 😂
---
That's my hope too!
---
Is the original in storage? Or did you scrap it?
---
Found a few 3 star yesterday all of them dropped 1-2 star weapons. Fought a bunch of 2 star and they all drop 2 stars
---
It's free.
---
Do you complain about getting something for free a lot?
---
Yeah I wasn't even mad.  I was just amazed how all that could happen in a row
---
Yeah i need to get my hands on some drugs lol. Berry mentats doesnt seem to have any side effects. Just stay off "pipe" cuz i heard that stuff may make it seem like pipe pistols are magical
---
Bethesda can call it an exploit if they want.  But in reality it's just their incompetence, nothing more, nothing less.
---
I mean you don't have to do all that stuff, it just requires some...illegal shortcuts (photomode glitch).
---
Yes, I put the bone meal where it goes but I cant get the option to place the chemicals. It has the mark where I'm supposed to but it will not let me place them.
---
Scrapped
---
Glad to hear it.
---
Move along civilian.
---
Freestate is the way to go ! A federation of self sufficient self manage comunities without a sate gouvernement does that mean im not patriotic ?  Dont really care i just know i hate those pesky left wing facist have no right here (better dead than red baby!!!)
---
If your on Xbox you can join my private server and run Whitesprings all you want. Just gotta wait for them to respawn.
---
I know unyielding doesn't give defense bonus, i was making the effect different to fit bloodied builds. While also letting it keep a special stat bonuses for non bloodied builds.
---
I think my version(even without defense/resist increase) would give players more reason to give up all special stats increases for individual stats if there was more reason to have +3 agility/per/chr/etc over +15 of all stats.
---
Ah, yeah I am under the perspective that bloodied just works. Keeping the unyielding buffs till i have all the perk cards i need. Then might settle down into a heavy gunner power armor build and not worry about leveling as much
---
Welcome to nine times the detail.
---
How do you lock things? Is it a perk?
---
i did both quests up to the point you have to pick a side. and i did chose settlers. You get no less rep. i even maxed raider first.
---
It's a bug
---
You guys are amazing! I appreciate the help you provide every one!
---
I was having trouble with that too and I think when I first placed it (the regular collectron station) there wasn’t so much around it my camp was new and just the essentials so I could place it easy you need room to access both sides of the station
---
I think I really pissed off the insult bot. I have 7 insults from him, not including the other two I trashed before I decided to collect them.
---
If so inclined Nuka Dark gives something like 6 str if you have the right perks - thinking party boy/girl and cola nut.  Also can get the Nuka Dark recipe from the drunk robot in Morgantown, thinking basement of tattoo(?) shop.
---
Edit: can also buy from the Whitespring bar tender upstairs in the resort.
---
So that’s how I got those rewards.... nice one
---
As a very long time fallout fan my first thoughts about 76 was “how the hell do these mechanics work in PvP”
---
Short answer is, they don’t. The PvP needs to be a lot more goal and tactics oriented imagine as a team getting 3 minutes to deck out your workshop, then you have to hold it for 3 minutes.
---
Imagine if there were terminals that had to be hacked in real time, with other players covering etc.
---
Use the limitations of the game to make PvP more compelling, don’t try to force a death match with a pve dominant engine
---
When one build stands too far above the rest then the game is unbalanced.
---
Being imbalanced has consequences, it's not really a choice for you to give up the most efficient build that has so much utility.
---
As a dev what do you balance the game around? Bloody unyielding? Or everything else? Everything becomes to easy if you DON'T balance for the strongest build.
---
The problem is no other build comes close, Nor is it normal for any other build to max you out on special stat effects let alone multiple at once.
---
STOP GIVING THEM MONEY.
---
\&gt;free special bonus
---
so you're saying we should make unyielding the unquestionable best legendary prefix for armor? because if you think there's little reason to use anything other than unyielding now, I can assure you there will me **no** reason whatsoever if you removed all the cons of unyielding armor. and not just for bloodied builds.
---
and bolstering is terrible for a reason.
---
The BOS do not like mutants so that is not surprising. Civilians are untrustworthy and capable of great mischief so they have to be watched and sometimes dealt with severly. They are not coming to save the locals. They are not Responders with better tech. They have their own agenda and are willing to sacrifice themselves and others to advance it so be warned.
---
Bet, lol. Even at 156 i visited a lvl 30's camp who you could tell was taking their time enjoying the game, and i gave the gift emoji and dropped 25 ish plans, but that seemed to scare off the guy cuz a moment later his camp vanished and i was there with my paper bag full of good plans too not even tryna harrass anyone lol
---
So the bone meal chamber is in the center of the machine near the top. The others are below the monitor. If you’re trying to deposit below the monitor and it’s not giving you the option the only other thing I would try is rebooting the game (not just change servers). If no one else has a solution fill out a support ticket. Gotta get that Radshield!
---
I got one today as a reward from protest march in Grafton.
---
Please accept a very confused upvote!
---
No no, I really just want to murder stuff.  Your politics don't concern me, and especially not in a video game.
---
I didn't either and that first char from the Beta was deleted months ago. No one would help me power level it so I could fix it. My 2nd character is not my main.  
---
The odds of someone helping isn't good.
---
I heard something like that from a raider not too long ago.
---
damn thanks
---
I didn’t think you could still get any rep after you picked a side. So do you still get the same daily quests for the raiders?
---
I've done all that so I guess the only thing left to do is wait to see if someone has a solution and fill out a support ticket. Thanks for stopping by though
---
I've also got radaways, stimpacks, and one piece of ultracite scrap from it. The last was definitely a pleasant surprise.
---
Yeah I need to change to the asbestos on the chest.  But I run buttressed on all right now.  Jetpack, stabilized on arms and  cushioned on legs.
---
unyielding is hardly the thing making bloodied builds stand out from the rest. I can assure you my extra intelligence is not killing Earle any faster.
---
Yeah I picked raiders and didn’t really care about settlers because all they had was a stealth suit and a shot gun and I’m a HG but now I’m almost done settler rep just so I can have it maxed for both
---
The santa-bot's dialogue is by far my favorite.
---
Yeah, I had a similar problem 
---
Just in case, if you have weapons stuck on them, you can remove them from other menus such as your vendor. Stash box too, i think
---
Just so people know, we have a good number of details about the BOS on the PTS, from quests that aren't enabled but are in the ESM. 
---
The force lead by &gt;!Paladin Rahmani!&lt; consists of &gt;!Three Cali BoS Members!&lt; and &gt;!initiates and hopefuls picked up on the way to WV!&lt;. They arrive at ATLAS, &gt;!initiate Dorsey on the spot for his efforts, and make attempts to recruit wastelanders as well as explore ATLAS.!&lt;
---
On their way to WV, they &gt;!lost communication with Lost Hills due to "raiders" destroying their comms equipment, and their commander, the aforementioned Rahmani, hasn't made re-establishing comms a priority.!&lt; Which can be taken how you want it to.
---
No. Too bad. I’m going to heal with with stimpack diffusers whether you like it or not.
---
Oops. That was the hallucigen.
---
Yeah, really wished I hadn't respeced. I mean, I'm much better off, but the amount of levels required for the legendary perks is insane.
---
People can’t destroy your camp unless you’re in pvp mode
---
I don't have them despawn but too often they goo doesn't spawn.    
---
Sometimes I have to wait and leave that area or log out completely before this wonderful 'feature' works properly.
---
The way he says "Nuka-Shine" cracks me up every single time.
---
At this point I'm gonna assume someone that loved the Brotherhood pissed in Todd's Sugar Bombs one day and now he's dead set on making the BoS shit till he dies.
---
It collects the scrap that was needed to complete the event. Cloth, leather, cork, wood, garbage, etc
---
Yeah that is what every bug and exploit is
---
Yeah the character I started playing nw on was ass for nw playing so I just hide and become a bush because I was the outcast paint
---
Yes. You can still build rep for both.
---
Because both sell specific bulion plans you can't get from the other. 
---
Gauss shotgun - settlers
---
Gauss minigun - raiders
---
As an example
---
I don't think there are plans for the base armor pieces.    
---
There are mods and only for sale from one of the MODUS terminals in the Whitesprings bunker. You can get pieces awarded both normal and Legendary from quest drops.
---
You could just bash them or take someone who is a melee build with you to finish them off
---
This is such a great idea! I wish they would do this!
---
I did it intentionally as I really really really disliked the raiders so I did absolutely nothing for them.
---
But of course! I love serving people.
---
Hey, I'd love to see ya in xbox. Is it possible to add you in game, or do you prefer messages over reddit?
---
The physical mod box?
---
The other builds do not have equivalents. People are like "yes bloodied builds are being the most affected by the nerf"...nothing will change...with the Unyielding set, bloodied builds will still be the meta next season. 
---
That Legendary perk card grind is about to proove it as f%&amp;@ !
---
Do they only start selling those once you’ve hit max rank?
---
yeah you need the appropriate lock picking level to lock a container in your camp.
---
Respectively shut up I don’t want to have to get all my gear back 😂
---
Those specific, yes. Its a grind lol
---
I gotta be honest, you can actually achieve immortality with level 3 born survivor, first aid, field medic, one piece of autostim armor and butt loads of super stims
---
Same, did it this way yesterday and it worked.
---
Damn I'm like 5 lvls from 100 and haven't launched one yet
---
Oh Bethesda, Bethesda never changes XD
---
In there, i jump in my PA and tank the dude...but for meat weeks and all the regular events and daily quests....this is insanity !
---
Nukes and Dragons was up but it didn't have everything.  
---
By then builds were so new and we were all ignorant. It wasn't a total waste of time as I learned a lot from my mistekes.
---
Sounds like somebody’s not using their resources! Seriously, there is a Trade Reddit to get what you need. Go trade rather than complain about the drop rates, because trading will ACTUALLY get you what you want.
---
[This vid should help you farm rep!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ycZJzw_TU) There are other ways than Roxsy!

There are a decent amount of duped weapons yes but accusing every high level of being a duper or owning duped weapons because they have better gear is kinda unfair don’t you think
---
yeah man had no idea what I was doing just me an some old friends exploring
---
Use [this resource](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations) to maximize your reputation gains.
---
I don't see why. I switched to a chameleon set a while ago and hardly noticed a difference.
---
except for the drop in exp. but still.
---
Oh no, don't give Beth ideas to give more advantages to the premium system that should be free (at least the scrapbox). :O Haha. It's like having to pay even more just to play the game the way it actually should be, without too much restrictions.
---
This is the problem. Unyielding leaves little room to consider anything else.
---
It's become a second skin, there is no other reason to find other special increase itemization important outside of "filler" items for the day you get unyielding piece to fill that slot.
---
Cats by Bethesda's own lore are not supposed to survive nukes their genetic makeup is unshook by the FEV and like most of the world were annihilated sorry, puss
---
Haha, no.
---
Probably conflicted with the modular armor system. Armor in 3/NV was more "skintight".
---
I thought you could change their color with the terminal?
---
I have lock picking 3
---
Bethesda giveth, Bethesda taketh, even if you were honest about what happened.
---
Holsters weapons were there in Skyrim, I doubt they'd remove it.
---
Is this satire?
---
I'm sorry. In case you didn't read the OP, or had any difficulty with comprehension, what happened here, was some whiner came in mistaking Atom refunds with SCORE.
---
I corrected them, because they were wrong. The OP isn't about SCORE....
---
So feel free to complain about it..... By creating a new thread or responding to a thread where it's actually relevant. 
---
Don't forget to spit in your hand.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Keycards are nice but otherwise they are garbage
---
Idk what legacy your using but I've never one shot a boss with a legacy, I kill them faster then many weapons sure but if I'm farming super mutant I'm not playing with others to tag them, but that's true when I use a junkies LMG or a explosive energy weapon. farming isn't a group activity, bosses are, as for the lag issue I've never experienced that from a legacy in my time playing other then the times when they break the game with updates such as the old goo pile spawn issue or the strangle PA time
---
As for hacked weapons those should be a bannable offense and has very little to do with legacies. Someone making an orbital strike minigun doesn't have a connection to some using a explosive energy weapon. Hack weapons are people putting together effects that they feel will kill everything in one go. They are designed to cause crashes and grief players with little other use so the connection isn't realistic. The only thing to connect them is a sense on your part that the effects don't belong and give an advantage you feel is unfair but pve doesn't require a level playing field, simply a reasonable expectation to be allowed to play. Having better gear then those around you doesn't detract from the game as a whole it simply make those who don't have it feel left out since they missed the chance but that's is normal in a online game every player isn't equal, time invested and understand of the system will always create a gap
---
While I don’t want them to be exclusively hostile, at least Crater and Foundation didn’t have the gall to ask people for supplies with no inkling of a reward. They did all the heavy lifting themselves.
---
I got the game played until lvl 13 and left cane back with wastelanders first month Back I got to level 30 and passed my friend who was way higher than me when I came back and I was a B unarmed build so I could just endlessly grind xp I got too lvl 50 in a week with double xp and two weeks after lvl 100, I’m now almost level 300 and I’m the highest level of my friends and trying to get the higher level
---
Lvl 3 born survivor, first aid, medics pump, many stimpacks and a vamp minigun is my solo spec :) I did find out my max tank on that tho, which was 12 scorched, 2 bears, some anglers, 4 snallygasters, a mirelurk king, the sb Queen and a blood bug. Bastard bloosbug every time.
---
I finally launched my first nuke a couple of days ago to trigger the Scorchbeast Qeen event just so I could get my 4th stable flourescent flux and make my SS Underarmor. My meelee build is now almost complete.
---
Update: My monthly subscription has been received along with the Atoms. See u in the wasteland folks!
---
Drop punchbowl and fill it then drop the soda machine.
---
Yes I'm looking at it in my stash right now.
---
These could be good ideas for power armor backpacks. I currently can carry more out of my power armor than in, its a little broken
---
Do beckkets ally quest line you get a anti armour faster fire rate .50 cal which is a really good starter weapon and a introductory weapon into HG
---
I mean once you get frog legs just hop and shoot 🤔 or hop and camp on a roof
---
Exactly, exactly. But if you already play with 15 intelligence and add and other 15 intelligence it really becomes op. With some buff here in there, i can go up to 45 intelligence and im not even optimised yet.
---
Super mutants lvl 48-65 = 400-450 xp
---
Nevertheless...a bloodied build will always make more xp with that armor set, and that's not cool.
---
Yeah basically just gonna be bags of nukashine or punch bowls full of it
---
Is this used to buy unknown plans or what?
---
And 36% of all statistics are made up on the spot
---
I have a meelee build, and unless it's one of those "magic guns" people love (Sold at my camp) or some meelee weapon I can use (store), I scrap all legendaries.
---
Same here!
---
Try and hop around a Gauss shotgun and tell me how well it works. And camping is the most boring way to play. Shouldn't have to hide up on a roof just because Bethesda made a gun ridiculously overpowered that takes zero effort to use.
---
Yo mama
---
&gt;there are plenty combat rifle skins...
---
...none of which work on the Fixer for some god damned reason.
---
You said “Bunker”, as in the prefab Atomic Shop bunker? If so, that probably explains it. All those prefab buildings can be destroyed pretty easily by even low level creatures. If that object gets destroyed, everything in it will usually disappear until you repair it.
---
It's like the God mode glitchers in GTA Online... Nothing gets done about those, but if you exploited a glitch in r*'s code, you get your whole character wiped. Developers don't care about the game experience or the little guy anymore. All they care about are the whales, the people that drop hundreds of dollars a month on the game and fuck everyone else.
---
They walk away after a second or 2, I don’t see the issue
---
So you don't die if you stay in the mine?????
---
*hUrR dURr Hi LvLz oNlyZ gOtZ dUpEz nEw GuNz WiLl mAkE DeM uSelEss*
---
I still don't see the problem. intelligence does what, exactly? make terminals easier? give you a bit move exp? how is that game breaking on any level?
---
not to mention anyone can pick an unyielding set up to farm exp and then ditch it later on. cranberry relish also gives you extra exp, so what?
---
Also, I learned the bayonet mod a long time ago and I can still mod a BP rifle with a bayonet without the use of a mod box, just thought I'd add that as I seen someone saying you can't do that anymore.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Me, I’m not wasting perk coins on something I technically have already
---
I do . I usually spit in their face as they hand over said free item . Professional degenerate here.
---
This one^
---
And look for a "prime" mod. I think thats what you got there
---
If I remember correctly the issue is modding the weapons changing their appearance a lot. Not that I know why rendering the mods while holstered is more difficult than while equipped.
---
Disco-balls will make this place dope
---
Me too. I’m sure they will find more ways to compensate us players.
---
I love punch bowls full of Cosby-shine
---
I’m 90% sure I know the mod, but not the one for The Dragon.
---
Just reading the title I thought the game was coming out with a way to sell plans to a vendor. I pictured a NPC roaming the map with a mule and you could sell and buy plans.
---
I put it on Commander Daguerre. But no not for me...
---
Or the most simple and logical, change formulas to take adjusted maximum health instead of possible max health.
---
Interacting seems to make them walk away, just like in Skyrim.
---
Like: "here have all these perks points you don't need.  JK, you actually really need them and sucks for you."
---
Oof hell no, only way that would work is if we got the ability to upgrade our level 45 and 50 guns to 100, and about 50 more skill points. Neither of which I see happening.
---
Works surprisingly tbh if you see them first cause as powerful as it is there is room for error on their end
---
I'm an avid player of nw if you know where a good loot spawns use that one area and camp for the last players since the last of them are more then likely be bush wookies and won't stand a chance against you if your decent at aiming 😉 
---
also if your put on morgan town get the water boy/girl perk and camp under water sometimes you'll find other people there too just pop them and take their spot
---
Me
---
The Secret Service underarmor adds 4 Strength, 20 Carry Weight!
---
This is why the game sucks cuz no one tries to get better at shooting. They either hide as you described or use explosive crutches.
---
I'm using legendary cards to up my SPECIAL points as high as I can go.  That said, I'm torn about the master infiltrator card.  It would free up 6 points that I can easily fill and I suck at remembering to switch perk cards back after swapping them.
---
I guess that’s where Lyons got his ideology.
---
I used to be able to mod the dragon with a bayonet, not sure when that got removed from the game but I have had quite a few long breaks.
---
It just works
---
Luck, intelligence, perception, power armor sprint, what rads and poison resistance.
---
Why would power armor builds have anything to do with non power armor builds?
---
it's not just the garage it's everything that gives you the option to put it on (which awesomely includes display cases making a two in one) best thing to to is put it so that it's floating in front of the wall but still in the green and not giving you the floating error, then exit build mode and check how much room you have between it and the wall, enter build mode again and move it back a little at a time so that the parts that stick out on the back of the weapon rack are touching the wall instead of trying to put them through the wall.  you may have to guess and check a bit but then when you have it the way you want it you can just blueprint it and never have to go through the hassle again.  putting them in too deep is what merges them with whatever you're trying to put them on and in most cases makes you unable to use them
---
They are openly against mutations and mutants, so you'll hear a lot about your mutations if you have any =)
---
Why not a lever? Use less ammo one hit most everything.
---
I've found no info on how to fix it but apparently Bethesda is having trouble with fallout 1st right now and are trying to fix it so hopefully when that happens it'll fix
---
Yeah, that’s sounds nice. Maybe they find Modus and re-establish the WV Enclave, kicking off the feud between the Brotherhood and Enclave.
---
Yeah well some people don't know how to cheese these legacy weapons to their maximum potential. Once you figure out how to use em, you'll find they are way over the line. It seems people are figuring it out as of late and that's why we are seeing bosses getting one shot. As I have mentioned, I own like 3 dozen legacies and tested them all. I am not even gonna talk about them hacked weapons with legacy attributes
---
Pretty sure wastelanders removed the option, because I’m very certain I knew the mod for The Dragon. It also might have been a side effect of them removing explosive as a roll, but god only knows how they could have done that.
---
I'm glad you mentioned this, because I was about to 😂
---
More or less the same here.  Do I wish the skills were passive?? Yes I do, I would use them maybe (big maybe at this point).  I have also gone like the last 300 levels ignoring locked stuff because I'm not switching perks around constantly for a 5 second lock pick minigame.  Don't really feel like I'm missing out on anything by not doing it either at this point.
---
The only spot I feel like I would actually use it is in silos.....but I can just glitch through the doors without wasting legendary perks on it.
---
Ohhh nice definitely need that one
---
Cards don't matter.  I would say gather ammo materials but don't make it because of the ammo card.  It'll be easier to level up after it drops.
---
Yeah not gonna use him XD
---
Combining cards and opening all packs now will save you time once the patch hits. Not that it will take less now vs doing it later, but ostensibly you have more free time currently than you will once the patch hits. I would say to be safe you probs want to save a few levels just in case you want to move special points around once the patch hits and we know if there were any changes to the perks from PTS to live
---
It looks good but these kinds of camps are way overdone lately, they all look almost exactly the same and people keep posting and posting and posting them
---
It’s with one of the two lining mods for it, not sure which one. Bought via Regs, the Secret Service agent vendor.
---
It's camping or dying.. this is bethesda were talking about even times before the guass shotgun the auto grenade launcher was the meta then also the mini gun glitch existed 
---
If your looking for something action pack well I gotta say your barking up the wrong tree
---
Be a bush/water wookie do little to no involvement with other players cause killing players yeild a little bit **XP** and profit with survival **XP** for leveling up overseer ranks
---
30 more special points here I come.
---
No you dont die.
---
Once I completed the main quests I rarely switch out cards to pick a lock. Part of me wonders what I’ve missed by skipping past them but the other part rememberers I got 2 nocturnal pistols the other night from mumbles so my luck is garbage anyway.
---
Fallout 1 had plenty of evidence to show they weren't angels
---
Probably sheilded thats usually the best version of underarmour
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question. How did you get the picture to link? I didn’t think pics were allowed in this sub. Sorry again
---
The wiki has this to say: "If you are unable to deposit the chemicals, check your inventory for  duplicates of the nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous, and if you have  doubles drop the duplicate and try again."
---
&gt;Can you cite when they have stolen from settlers
---
No, I'm entirely too lazy to jump down that rabbit hole. I 'd get distracted, and never make it out. 
---
And I don't think that they're *bad* people. In the beginning they were even the force that the wasteland needed. There are individuals that are awesome. But I'm really uncomfortable calling an organization with regimented justification of things like classism, homophobia, and the genocide of victims as 'the good guys.'
---
No, loot away.... When the mine collapses you're transported outside the mine with all your loot. Then when outside the completed event thing pops up and you get the event awards.
---
Except for a few leaders in the Appalachian Enclave, most of the Appalachian Enclave wasn't sinister, didn't realize the extent of Thomas Eckhart's plan, and actually tried to stop him. They all died in their attempt to stop him and protect the people of Appalachia, sadly.
---
Some members of the Appalachian Enclave knew the full details, but most of the key players died. Once the rank-and-file knew the truth, they quickly organized an outright rebellion and arrested Eckhart.
---
Yup! Also gives 4 endurance and 2 perception.
---
Hmm ok I'll look into that, thanks.
---
You can get rep fot both factions after vault 79.
---
Well as you can't read what i just wrote imma try to make it simple than lol.
---
Lvling you junkie build will be harder than lvling a bloodied build. Test for your self...but an other armor set...go farm some super mutants as Westek or Hunterville and repeat the process with an Unyielding set. 
---
But as i wrote and tried to say is that as full health builds dont need an Unyielding armor set, the "legendary perk card" grind will be rougher for them.
---
The members of the Enclave already detonated explosives on MODUS during the rebellion. It didn't work out for them.
---
It's not an event. It's the Forbidden Knowledge repeatable quest. You turn in technical documents at Camp Venture. You can only turn in 1 document at a time. If you find a location that has more than 1 document, DON'T pick them all up at once. Grab 1 turn it in, go back &amp; repeat.
---
It's the same with the nuka girl outfit

#HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO GET JIGGY WITH THIS??
---
Me me me!
---
Haha as if the engine can do that without shitting itself.
---
It was incurable due to some random bug in a quest line.
---
Petition to add a Fisto Collectron to the Atomic Shop
---
Took me about as long to hit 50 as it did for me to go from 50 to 150. At this point I need a wes tek shirt
---
I just took down my old collectron and put up the BOS one and set it to collect ammo and weapons.
---
I disagree. I once put my camp next to the spawn of robots and super mutants by accident. I got those bunkers at that time as my theme and was being attacked very often, never been attacked so much before but my structures as those named bunkers always sustained very little damage and after a few days of constant attacks I never had to repair it. Besides next to Vault 76 the creatures are mostly low lvl and wouldn't do much damage. Ofc if level affects the damage. Could be lucky, but still I think a concrete structure wouldn't be destroyed easily by some lvl 5 molerats.
---
no you just get teleported out.  i was worried about the same thing my first time because i couldnt find the way out and didnt want to lose all the screws i looted.  it's actually better to stay and keep looting all the bodies since screws are needed for so much and there are so few good farm spots for them
---
I domt remember dying instantly when the sun rises in syrim but i might not have played it to its fullest extent
---
Do you happen to know if you lose any from the one you don't raid with?
---
I think you're the one who needs to go back and re-read my posts. I just said I switched from an unyielding set to a chameleon one. I even said I did notice a drop in exp.
---
but my point still stands: **so what**? grinding for exp isn't all there is to this game. and nothing's stopping a full health build from farming exp with unyielding gear at low health. it's the same with cranberry relish, what's stopping anyone from cooking themselves one? carnivores have to adjust, yes. but after the grind is gone they can just go back to being carnivores.
---
cranberry relish being exclusive to herbivores does not mean it should be nerfed or removed from the game. it's just a buff after all. same logic applies to unyielding.
---
Ok that's pretty handy too.
---
Fair enough, it's not like I'm trying to win converts, I actually find the Brotherhood pretty boring and always have - Fallout won me over when they started to introduce more interesting elements in FO2. I think what I enjoy discussing more is the weird bleed over people have with their own ideologies/politics, rather than adopting the persona of someone in-setting and roleplaying, as someone who has spent many years are a roleplayer. I don't think I could even enjoy Fallout if I had to put it's factions or characters in boxes because they have pretty much all done horrible things to survive and thrive. I mean, when we meet Hancock he shanks a guy multiple times in the gut for hustling and not showing proper respect to his authority and leaves him to bleed out in the gutter and no one even blinks. Everyone is flavors of terrible.
---
I would if it didn’t mess with my hair
---
Only a bit when you take all the gold, but take all the gold it is worth it. You will see what i mean when you play it
---
At my lvl (295) and my build (+14 intelligence) killing a Wendigo in my power armor  rewards of about 150xp. Outside...with my Unyielding set...above 300xp. If my dps wasn't needed and if tanks were more popular...i'd go in that event just to kill wendigos outside my power armor.
---
Power Armor isn't productive for me anymore.
---
I recognize your GT-I feel like you’ve been in my server quite a few times. Totally agree-the last 10 or so times I have died have been to players with frog legs, gun runner, and a gauss shotgun (sometimes multiple players on the same team have it, along with power armor). And there is nothing worse than someone suited up in power armor, moving at double speed/jumping at twice the height, and carrying around the Fallout/explosive laser equivalent of the rocket launcher from Halo. 
---
What’s the point of working on your aim/using a rifle if you’re dead in seconds, at the hands of someone who normally would be toast (due to their poor aim) in a BR that requires tactics and careful maneuvering? These teams can be extremely reckless and race across the map-and still get away with it due to an extreme emphasis on a handful of weapons and a few perks.... It’s a shame really-I used to really enjoy this game mode-now it’s a a contest as to who can spam two buttons the fastest (jump and shoot).
---
Sell it while you can...I have 10 of them.
---
I use my Instigating or Junkies shotguns in the Earl fight all the time.  Sometimes first Wendigo takes two shots because I only have 3 level 1 shotgun perks equiped but once adrenaline kicks in the rest I VATs 1 shot.
---
What’s it worth
---
hmm it had a static screen for me. i'll try it again
---
I need a shirt that says 90% of my hours were spent at west tek/WhiteSprings/burrows/Charleston capital building
---
I didn't realize you made two posts where you replied to yourself. So i was confused you should probably combine it into one post with the edit button.
---
I thought of the same, but it doesn't always work tho. I have an explosive gun and sometimes misclick and shoot by accident and it does some damage to everything around and sometimes when I see a forest cure for 1200 caps I shoot out of frustration (not to each any lesson, because it's pointless) and do no damage at all. I still haven't figured this out.
---
Still not fixed... I haven't had Roxy reset in 5 days. The robot at the Overseer's house hasn't had me take pictures in at least 3 days. Wren only popped 3 times this week. Ward is almost every day, but occasionally misses 1.
---
“Why should I give my scrap to you?”
---
Likely a reference to how the community was reacting to the Fortifying ATLAS donations.
---
Nobody needs a supply of Nukashine. Nukashine is a fun quest feature, a party trick, a gimmick.
---
It is not a regular/core gameplay mechanic nor is it actually useful, and placing it as a reward is shortsighted.
---
Danse gives you a Brotherhood-upgraded laser rifle and lets you wander off with it if you don't want to sign up. They don't care what you have tech-wise as long as it's not going to destroy your settlement because it requires training to use safely or its going to represent an existential threat to the population.
---
Ok that’s all I needed to know appreciate it man.
---
Shoot. Ill come to your camp and insult you for free
---
No idea but not dropped for me.  I got 3 harpoon guns you can have in exchange
---
Welcome.
---
Actually yeah we are entitled to a fun rewarding game we paid for it lol, if cucking for Bethesda makes you feel like Todd howard loves you that's cool but the rest of us want a fun game kid
---
Where can I find these files?
---
you bet your sweet ass they are.
---
No idea, but thankfully modders managed to figure it out and change it with the Classic Visible Weapons which I’m sure is a recent release, still don’t understand how modders got it to work but Bethesda somehow couldn’t :/
---
Are they all good? What mods and what legendary buffs am I looking for?
---
I thought so too until I noticed one time my shots do damage to person's camp for some reason and neither of us was in PvP and I have pacifist mode always on. 🤷‍♀️
---
I do, give the coat to me. Lol
---
Oh, definitely. I was just thinking myself an idiot for arguing chivalry in the Fallout universe. The only place true good has there is to make you mourn the dead.
---
From the name of the next storyline after they arrive I'm going to assume &gt;!it wasn't raiders at all and Rahmani just wants to create her own feudal state. Time will tell. Honestly, I welcome them Brotherhood potentially being antagonists for a change, as I really didn't/don't want to be forced to join up to experience part of the ongoing 76 narrative.!&lt;
---
Yeah, reading through the lore for the Appalachian Enclave, a handful of awful people were in charge and kept the master plan to themselves. Once Eckhart's plan became common knowledge, the majority of the Enclave members rebelled, arresting Eckhart. They attempted to destroy the data stores for inhuman weapons research by detonating MODUS's memory banks. In doing so, they became a threat to MODUS, forcing MODUS to stop them. Ultimately, the members of the Enclave took a stand against the leadership, exactly the same way that Roger Maxson did when he took a stand against the government.
---
Um.... I haven’t had any issues when I play. 
---
Maybe you need to practice?
---
Maybe you got more rep back then or somethin but thats just not the case now.
---
I have received all plans and weapons from this event but only one mask and I’m keeping it. Love the way it looks and the light is the best. Hoping the add more cursed weapons tho.
---
I hope we have the option to fight against them. I loved how we could go against them in Fallout 3
---
Uh, I've got a laser gun prime receiver.
---
&gt;No no, I really just want to murder stuff.  Your politics don't concern me, and especially not in a video game.
---
My bad! Here I thought people could play games for different reasons!
---
Silly me!
---
So much for freedom!
---
There’s an exploit that you can do if you have the vault tec generator from the atom shop that will increase your camp budget
---
we'll just nuke them to oblivion
---
Yeah.....it’s a logical argument. I can’t argue with that.
---
Don’t wear it.  Simples
---
Plasma Caster never had one. It was just really thick and long
---
You do like you want...but again. You gotta play low health you know !? Like it or not...you gotta play low health. That's the point. And it's an old debat bro...unless you have near no intelligence, the xp boost the Unyielding set is giving is significant. This is why i'm telling you to test it back. I presume you didn't test it right.
---
[Edits:] And even...an whole unyielding set is just to strong and it comes to xp...I don't know how you managed your test, but whatever bro
---
Anyway, peace man, i gotta go back to my business. ✌👋
---
I see your side and I simply have to disagree. One shot boss fights are a magic weapon problem that should never have happened to begin with. hacked weapons have nothing to do with legacy weapons as legacy are simply the explosive prefix or double prefix and the worse hacked weapons have nothing to do with making a laser have explosive damage or having double ammo they mix miniguns with mini nukes and crash the servers when fired
---
But I don't think you will ever agree with me and that's okay just a difference of opinion
---

Really I didn’t know that personally I hate playing in 3rd person
---
I bought one for 5000 caps
---
The make great cannons on a pirate ship style camp
---
Can we swap out the Nukashine for, oh, I dunno..... anything?
---
Gotta pay 1000 atoms
---
Cool
---
I didn’t know that. It even shows the models in game without the leather hood. It just looks like Paladin Danse found a fish bowl and put it on.
---
True! If I had the option to use this cannon as a placeable cannon that deletes my broadsider I'd do it in a heartbeat
---
For your kidney it’s all yours
---
5 caps. i'll give you 6 though
---
You might have been in the area when free range completed. Did a event complete pop up appear at all?
---
Not shocked at all if the Boss tries to come to Appalachia and flex. Watch how fast they route back to the west coast...
---
And also they didn’t feel like making the models change for the new PA system
---
\*Silently starts to chant Enclave than gets louder as it continues\* Join the Enclave, where we set off nukes to save Appalachia from a giant nuclear bat monster and kill some random settlers dad that got trapped in the mines for his skin to make a rug out of him!
---
I will pay 15k on PC
---
Stick it a weapon stand.
---
But I want to look like a spaceman after all it was the whole theme of this season.
---
I stopped opening my packs so I won’t loose duplicates and I’ll have more to work with in theory.
---
Outside MODUS clearly having plans of his own ("We're just going for... a little walk.") and clearly sinister at that, it would make sense for more practical and opportunistic 76ers to use the resources on offer for sure. I don't roleplay it that way on my main because it doesn't fit the character, but I can understand someone who is simply playing a more pragmatic hero or anti-hero doing so. A small fort built on the Whitespring greens, surrounded by a small defensive army of bots (that lorewise MODUS probably controls), and being armed with the best tech MODUS can provide with a few beneficial mutations to boot, is arguably the strongest force that can be put together in Appalachia as the game world stands. Even the Brotherhood can't compete with that.
---
Yea I agree.  I like how the edges are kind of sporadic canopy, but the deeper you get in the swamp starts to take over.
---
Done.
---
And that'll be really obvious and make for really negative press.
---
You're welcome my duder.
---
I am writing a Fallout 76 novel from that perspective....500 pages in the draft so far.
---
And be tempted to pick it up again!? In all seriousness that's not a bad idea. It's just as useful on a shelf
---
I’d pay up to 5, it’s probably worth more now but by Christmas will be in the 300-1000 caps range
---
Raider is probably the best one unless you really need junk
---
It'll mean that your build will benefit from stuff like instigating, anti armor (depending on damage type), furious (depending on weapon speed), berserkers (depending on armor) etc. They'll all be reasonable choices comparatively.
---
Maybe it is a 'buy one, get one free' type promotion?
---
I'm joking, you get the sheepsquatch club from the free range event. So like Fredsux99 says, you might have been in range of that event when someone else completed it. Not sure about the picnic blanket.
---
Generally any new rare outfits or headpieces from farmable events go for 10k+ and then things from limited time events like the pirate costume tend to go for 30k ish or trades. Not everything follows suit here but its a good general guide. Things like the leather outfits and stuff like that hold value because their drop rates are so small.
---
I have yet to get a mask from the event.  Had to trade to get one.  I’ve received a few cursed weapons, plushie/rug plans, and scrip legendaries...
---
Enclave: People of Appalachia, we are the Enclave. And we have come to save you...
---
Settlers: Hooray it’s the Enclave-
---
Enclave: ...FROM YOUR SELVES!!!
---
**Opens fire on the unarmed settlers**
---
Settlers: Oh no it’s the enclave...
---
I have around 9 int. most of my exp comes from unyielding. you're still missing the point regardless.
---
unyielding is similar to a buff, like cranberry relish. it's not necessary at all, but it's nice to have.
---
if you're farming for exp, you'd eat a cranberry relish, no? same with unyielding. even if you're a high health build, if you're farming for exp, just equip an unyielding set.
---
done.
---
I'd like missile launchers to be useful, no doubt. Angry Turtle LOVES grenade launchers.
---
Aren't we all
---
So I can have my Fasnacht boi get a different loot pool from my BoS boi?
---
I'm level 487. I don't need practice
---
I just started playing this week and I already have a farm set up for making it so I can give it out to players out of the vault to teleport them into the middle of nowhere (sorry). The only rate limiting factor on it's production so far is quantum, they may as well be just gifting you a nuka-cola quantum
---
Do not fret for the Enclave shall get is due and then the Brotherhood will feel the sting of our plasma.
---
Most hacked weapons are literally all legacies. For example, hacked 50cals are 50 cals firing scattered explosive energy rounds. We got miniguns, handmades version of that. These are some of the most used hacked weapons. So if you see your boss spawns evaporating, look around. You will find someone wielding a handmade with a beam splitter attached instead of a silencer. Other hacked weapons like orbital strikes or nuke miniguns are not that commonly used cause it's too obvious and they don't do a damn thing against bosses
---
Same thing happened to me but now I have access to half my Atomic Shop stuff, can't go on the shop AND can't use my already paid for Fallout 1st
---
Ugh
---
I know, it is just curiosity really.
---
I hope so because you didn't have to miss much of the seasons to miss out on finishing it. I did some stuff in July, enough to get a bit into the 1st third of the board, but then life got crazy. I came back for August and only just made it to the last 3rd. I was pretty bummed to find out it ends this week. All in all I probably missed 2/3 weeks. I get that they are short, but it still sucks. Especially getting myself this far and spending any atoms to move along faster. Wouldn't have done that if they made it clearer in game how much longer the season lasted.
---
Shotgun rocks, only one I’ve crafted
---
Your main base is going to be blown up by a goddamn savage. Your sweetest digs won't help there.
---
You like.. took this out of my head. This is exactly what I thought when I started playing, now I'm closing to lvl 200 and still don't have everything I need even for one build.. There was time I enjoyed the grind and then I just don't anymore. But I still enjoy the game, so I will most likely come back after some break and updates 😅
---
&gt;!Everything about Rahmani indicates she's a good person, which made her unpopular with most of the leadership.!&lt;
---
That's how we learn IRL or in games.  
---
My main how is 115 and the highest level I've ever had for any character.  
---
You're not the only one as new players are still starting out and are also lost.
---
Last time I ran into you, you threw 2 grenades and me in a 2v1 fight before I even i had a gun. The real issue is people spawning before you.
---
Ones that suit your build.
---
Heroes come in all shades, even grey.
---
The Gauss Minigun and Gauss Shotgun are great weapons. The rifle and pistol aren't so great due to various bugs that plague them (broken in vats being the biggest).
---
I just hit level 100 on The Legendary Run yesterday and I'm completely burnt out. I'm not even going to use 95% of the stuff I unlocked, either.
---
[I saw the rewards for this upcoming season](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons), and I'm not even going to attempt to put in the effort I put in to The Legendary Run. It's just not worth it.
---
edit: Added link
---
Desyntery, probably
---
They're not shooting to do damage, they're using explosive bait. Look up how :)
---
The damage you notice when you *shoot* at others camps is just visual. Their camps, with the exception of their Brahmin, aren't getting hurt.
---
The damage you get when you use explosive bait is not just visual, itll level a camp if you have enough of them.
---
Yeah it would be cool if strangler did it but the AoE on strangler sucks ass
---
I regularly abuse my non-main characters by eating whatever I can find and drinking pond scum. So far my strat has been working well.
---
Your team uses nothing but explosives you got what you deserved
---
My vote goes to: Any of the thoughts running through my head...
---
Very creative!
---
I'm lvl 491and have nothing to do with my character. I've felt like it's always been this way too... Until I began leveling my alts. Holy crap... How to did I get to 491 😂
---
Learn something new every day :-)
---
Thanks...
---
Oooh, okay, you solved the mystery for me xD I know about something with explosive bait but not gonna look it up tho, I find it toxic when people do that. I was just curious. Thanks for explaining to me :p
---
I've been dropping my junk on death during the event - only started happening the last couple of days.
---
Ward. It’s always Ward.
---
This post highlighted for me, in my opinion, the worst part of the game.  Grinding for scouts badges, and in particular,  those that will not be acheived in solo play.
---
Revive a friend.
---
As a lone wanderer often am not participating in group events, so the chance of reviving anyone are slim to none.
---
I managed this once, through loading my character time and again at Whitesprings, as this was a common area for people to fall.
---
Having started a new character during lockdown to basically 'begin anew' I was plodding along happily until the reality of this challenge hit me.
---
It took almost a month for me, playing 20-40 hours per week as a solo player to get this one achievement.   Do I really want to invest that again in a new player?
---
In short, no.  I have reverted to my previous character and am now taking on early level Wastelander quests with a level 80, near infinite ammo/meds character.
---
Surely there has to be a compromsie?
---
NB:  I also have Fallout 1st enabled, but rarely use the private world.  Imagine if I did and needed to revive someone!
---
It's worth about $9K, the non douchebag rate. Anything over that is douchebag prices...
---
Me, but only for my heavy gunner because I don't use him for nuke silos. My choice of legendary perks are:
---
Posion resist, fire resist, Power armor reboot, Int, Luck, Agility
---
The goddamn fasnacht collectron and fuck right off. Pretty sure people put them in their camps just drive business away... well played... well played indeed.
---
Ummm...  i don't use explosives cause my rb is broken. And you had the advantage. How did I, a solo player get whag i deserve? Plus you can't complain about something you actively use. Plus I don't have a team.
---
Thanks! I don't how i worked, but your method is worked!
---
Funny Story, i started project paradise alone yesterday and 3 people joined before the friendly animals showed up but by the time the second wave showed up there were about 7 or 8 and all three animals were still alive (was excited cause i need the bear arm mods).  They were able to kill the alpha quickly while i guarded my lv. 1 animal alone and i yelled "Cmon Bear Arm Plan!" 
---
My biggest mistake, because i surprisingly got the bear arm plan and need the mods so i should have yelled "Cmon Bear Arm Mods." : ( 
---
Well anyway grateful i got something and thankful for a team of randoms to play that actually completed it with all 3 still alive.
---
Damn, this looks good!
---
Any suggestions or requests on what other types of cards to make?
---
Wow flex much?
---
Ah, ignoring my point. - check.
---
Being weirdly hostile - check.
---
being condescending - check.
---
I'm not "cucking" for anyone. I'm just not throwing a hissy fit because 2 of 100 prizes in a free event  are kinda shitty.
---
Reevaluate your behavior, its embarrassing. Ok, "kid".
---
"I like you better when I'm wasted"
---
Friends and the trading networks.
---
Great work! These are awesome!!
---
Bloodied?
---
&gt;!That would be interesting, and would make my decision not to side with them (mostly because I prefer autonomy rather than considering them enemies) tougher, but there is always the chance that's just the mask she puts on to appeal to the Appalachians. !&lt;
---
Probably never.  It was cut content.
---
I prefer chats in reddit so I have a list of requests to reference
---
Shotgun is excellent and the Minigun is truly excellent (though thirsty on the ammo - priming ups the damage, but I cannot keep ahead of its consumption with flux).
---
Pompadour wigs, leather, and oil cans.
---
I actively use a submachine gun. Almost every time I have come across you, you try to use explosives against me. I have killed you without a grenade countless times.
---
VATs for PvP broke after Wastelanders, hence why you were hitting for zero damage.
---
The absolute best Gauss Minigun is a 2 Shot FFR, 2nd is Bloodied Gauss MG FFR, have both but the 2 Shot performs and deals more consistent DPS
---
Can you kill them ? I haven’t tried but  think murder is the solution
---
Miniguns are great.
---
I do agree, though as far as weeks to spare goes I know they’d never do that but it would be a good compromise if the missed ones got added to a backlog that started to roll off the longer they were unfinished. So on a weekend you could clean up those 2 or 3 days of missed challenges before they rolled off the next week. I think something like that would be reasonable. 
---
It seems to me they took Covid shutdowns into consideration for these. My job was thankfully not compromised by Covid (actually the opposite, workloads/hours increased greatly due to it) so some nights I was exhausted, passed out and forgot about Fallout. Would be nice to have a way for everyone to make those up. Like when a new Monday comes, the previous Monday rolls out of the backlog.
---
As a quantum build, the quickest way to take me out is a melee weapon with a bleed or poison damage. Just saying.
---
Wow salty much? Don't be upset cuz I kill you all the time and you try to blow me up but fail 😂
---
Yeah. In this game never ever anything till you've researched whether or not it actually works.
---
As i told you...good for you...but this set isn't for high health builds...that's the point here. This is what you don't understand. A Bloodied Sniper build or a Bloodied commando build will always get more xp than the Junkies Sniper build and a  Junkie commando build.
---
Technicly there's no point to stay on those builds
---
Do you get it now !? 
---
Now if you wanna stick to your opinion...that's fine.👋
---
[Edit:] here...i really mean high health builds
---
Not saying you haven't. But you try throwing grenades first then rush. Have i used the in the past yea, but in the last 100 levels? No.
---
Just got mine working
---
You can bypass that if you have Veronica.
---
Yep, the BOS Fatigues also. Limited time though, just check out the atom shop
---
There are many sources out there that has answered this question.
---
In it's default setting, it collects whatever the BoS needs for that current stage of the Event. However, hit ENTER and you get the typical list of choices that matches whichever other Collectron you own. I have them all so I can select Weapons and Ammo. It's AWESOME
---
I knew they were bad but not this bad
---
Very cool
---
That's not at all how I play lmao try again. I don't throw grenades because every single other person does.
---
Ye, I know but I've seen conflicting things and was hoping somebody could give me a better answer
---
I have 600+ perk points, 60+ perk packs, &amp; multiple doubles of card...Lvl 784, I'd wait...no rush.
---
So, should we start hoarding nuclear keycards?
---
Kk. This is your second post in the past few weeks where you complain about something you rely heavily on and mention your level without anyone asking for it
---
It’s for lower level players...
---
Same GT?
---
On second thoughts you're right I'll just figure it out
---
how do you get the respondor one
---
Thank you! This is unfortunate but good to know. Where could I have found this info myself?
---
With the industry as a whole being as fluid as it is, I'm almost certain long term Bethesda mod makers know more about the engine and all that more than a sizable portion of Bethesda's current staff.
---
The absolute best part of the 90% reduced weight version is that it can be modded to weigh 0.0 as one of the mods reduces weight. Because of this I buy every single one I have ever seen in a vendor. Total count so far 1. Lol. 
---
Enjoy your decorative cannon for what it is. Garbage.
---
Good to know thank you
---
Just scrapped it. RIP
---
I’ll stick to my vampire 10mm! Thank you
---
Hope so!
---
 Nukashine is a reward??? Just give me the 6 caps and save me a trip to the train station.
---
As far as key cards go, there are plenty of higher level kind souls that will gladly hand them out to newer players.
---
I shall try!!
---
KK. You're full of shit. You watch me play every single round? Didn't think so. I kill countless players with only sub. Have 100s of 20 kill games using only my gun. Just cuz you can't aim doesn't mean others can't.
---
Claim the rewards, than turn your back on those COMMUNIST BASTARDS! NEVER LET THOSE CLOTHES BE WORN AGAIN
---
That's pretty cool, hope you share it once it's done.
---
Nobody is ignoring your point because you didn't have one. Also I'm not embarrassed because I know I'm right.
---
That'll be the light barrel! Yeah, I'm quite happy with that. I'll keep it around for this 1 purpose
---
The wendigo cave quest was bugged and I couldnt do it bit I managed to do it this morning (for some reason) so I'm gonna try hammer it out like you said.
---
I learned through getting the mods and finding out what they all did over time. Most of the wikis will show the mods that are available so you can get a better idea of what you can do with them.
---
Plasma caster nor the Smitty special never had a backpack and was based off the model for what was originally the plasma rifle in FO1 and 2.
---
It’s one of those super duper rare item drops from doing events or dailies in the forest.
---
I think its next week on Sep 10th - 14th.
---
Honestly i find most of the legendary perks are kinda just meh at level 1 so i'm just throwing Infiltrator on until i actually need the slot. (but yeah it's a "i'm starting an alt" perk)
---
What Rads? and Funky Duds are going to be the two that i max out first, the rest may just be specials.
---
I assume you can’t get down to it?
---
Interesting.
---
What spoiling quests? Cool
---
YESSSS
---
Ace the Raider has personality, which is why he is the best collectron
---
Agreed terribly shortsighted.
---
For those of you unfamiliar with Destiny, the postmaster is an npc who holds and delivers lost items and gifts to your player character. Any rare or higher quality gear that is not picked up by you (like loot that you missed) will be held by the Postmaster until the next time you log in. Postmasters also serve as the delivery system for unique loot, like pre-order bonuses.
---
The tables for railings *chefs kiss*
---
Nope. After dropping about halfway down, it’ll teleport you back above ground
---
I don’t believe it was instant but I do remember all of your stats and perks suffering; which makes sense.
---
Thanks for clearing that up !
---
trickle that shit down yo
---
There’s a quest that gaurantees them. 
---
Fireworks would have been better at least.
---
Kinda looks like a vetibird wing maybe?
---
Yes!!
---
I'm coming up on my 256 soon and your telling me I got to go to 512...
---
Thanks for the tips at least 
---
I'm just shy of 5000 on the 7600 wood too. Last few to go other then magazines and few bugged ones. I don't know what I'll do when I'm done.
---
I Suppose this will be even easier with the legendary card for auto hacking.
---
looks like a vertibot rotor after it exploded and clipped through the ground. is it still there if you quit and rejoin a new server?
---
People usually cripple the ghoul legs at their spawn and afk the event.
---
It’s not free if it costs either atoms to unlock or literally gameplay every single day of the week. 
---
Value your own time a bit.
---
nice stuff
---
Add lead and we have a deal!
---
Imagine being upset someone asks for a gun that can do any damage in this trash game. Let alone the God roll legacy you "earned n traded" is an almost guaranteed duped item. Like no shit dont make the trade with em but don't complain about shit you "earned" like 7/8th of your character isn't duped trash from someone else.
---
I like Master Infiltrator conceptually, but just like Picklock and Hacker I don't feel like they deserve the slots over pretty much anything else. Level 3 container definitely have better loot, but having to give up legendary perk slots(or spending perk coins to swap) for them just isn't appealing. Maybe if they added a chance for bobbleheads or something.
---
I'm probably going to run a mix of poison resistance and ammo crafting.
---
I love the simple things, fallout 76 is just quaint software, ya’ know? Like with all the glitches and unusual design choices I find really fascinating. The alien blaster for example, I have plenty of tin foil theories as to why that weapon is the way it is that I could go on forever. And the visuals also work for me, even if they look really gross most of the time. Now if only I could get a stable 60+ fps, but probably going to be a long time before I can upgrade my rig.
---
But then you wouldn't buy stuff and regret it afterwards, just to buy some atoms to get more stuff that turns out to be not what you expected.
---
They better have paladin patrols in power armor, the current highest level human enemies are a joke. Cultists are the only ones that are even remotely challenging, and only if they get lucky with their weapon spawn
---
neither is bolstering, but some full health builds prefer it over vanguard's. anyone can use unyielding, that's my point.
---
but more to your point, the difference is that full health builds don't have to play at 19% health. and if you do choose to play at 19% health, commodities such as extra exp is what you get. they're hardly game breaking by the way, as I've pointed out before.
---
I get your point, I do. but I think you're missing the whole point of the word 'build'. the point of a junkie's build isn't to farm exp. neither is a bloodied build for that matter, that's just a side effect. but on the flip side, if you do want to make a build centered around farming exp, then you can use unyielding gear. and switch back once you're done.
---
bloodied getting more exp than junkie's or what have you is a non point. it's literally meaningless. it's like saying 'people who cook cranberry relish get more exp than me, who refuses to let go of carnivore, and that's a bad thing'. it makes no sense.
---
what about a gamma gun?
---
While they've done that for me (usually after they finish their current animation loop) without any issues, I've been running into another problem where I'll travel into camp, there won't be an npc on the crafting table but it will give me the 'this is in use' message, and the only fix I've found is going into camp edit and shifting the crafting station a bit.
---
I play a full health build, so Instigating weapons work for me. I got lucky and landed a 3* Instigating shotgun on my fifth roll. Prime receiver, extended barrel, forceful stock, perforating magazine, short scope, clandestine paint are my mods.
---
They’re just Gouls with guns, and no way they are being wiped out, there isn’t enough end game content for them to be removing even more
---
Wow, thats nuts. When I do that event, its always a freaking mob of mid to high level charred ghouls, 8-10 at least. Wish I had your luck.
---
You can't make an image post, but you are allowed to link images within the body of a text post
---
Respect the legacy. I got a troubleshooters explosive tesla and it is great with an auto barrel, will admit I wish there were more mods.
---
I want the old nuka cola machine
---
That would be badass
---
“The only winning move is not to play...”

Reported
---
Thant’s my office. Stay out.
---
Stay mad king
---
Holy shit this is good. Haven't seen any camp like this in the year I've played the game.
---
Vampire +Limb Damage +Faster Reload Gauss Minigun....best weapon ever!
---
Reported for reporting.
---
I recently got a nice Bloodied grenade launcher that I've been debating what to do with. Guess I know what it's for now.
---
Thanks
---
PLEASE Bethesda, give us more tools to place camp structures at weird angles without jumping through glitch hoops.  This stuff is amazing.
---
A level 50 requested a trade, and I accepted. I had a B25 Laser rifle, which he requested. I had just rolled a B2525 Ultracite Laser rifle from the purveyor, so I offered the 2 star for 15k caps. He bought it and gave me a heart emote. Made his day, and netted me a fair bit of caps. Who knows? Maybe a mediocre gun to you is a god roll to them?
---
Right about what? Being unreasonably upset over a video game?
---
Oh my god!!!!!! 2 items on the legendary run suck. Everyone flip the fuck out and get hostile and crazy and offended!!!! Outrage culture!!!! wooooo!!!!
---
I’m gonna use it myself mostly just so I can unlock level 3 safes, they have good plans and I try to keep track of any I find so I can revisit them, the auto unlock and hacking is also nice so I can get the atom challenge for hacking 512 of the damn things. It’ll definitely be the last one I rank up though, haha.
---
Kinda had it too with legendary run and it's not like I grinded the hell out of it, I took it easy and even missed a few days but then I just gave up and bought very last 2 lvls because I was really getting tired and impatient even without dedicating my whole play time to it.. I'm still not sure about season 2, haven't seen the rewards yet, but most likely will just put it aside as well.
---
Maybe with the brotherhood coming, it might just reduce them down to the queen boss event?
---
I start with picklock equipped till I get a technical document from any source, then swap it out and forget it
---
if they have to remove everything we can get during quests, they also need to remove caps, bullion and scrip...
---
Reported for reporting the reported.
---
&gt; excitement to grind 
---
See here, the entire problem with this community.
---
Dm?
---
I don't bother lock picking anything anymore, as whatever is in the box I really don't need, the only lock I pick is in White spring nuke zone as there is a glowey in the pool cupboard.
---
Would like to see a picture of a camp exactly like this?
---
How? I understand how it works but what I’m asking is about the time. This happened to me last night, everyone did the queen fight but when it was done there was no way to get into ACP. I saw the notification when the nuke dropped so I know it spawned. Did the queen just not die fast enough or is there another way?
---
Ammo and enemy levels will be fixed in an upcoming patch.
---
As for weapons and armor breaking. There are multiple perks which can help with that problem.
---
It's always like that in the beginning.
---
You just soldier through.
---
What do you need specifically? I'm on Xbox. Maybe I can help.
---
You gotta do ACP first, then travel to he queen after -...
---
Brotherhood are very strict about stuff like mutants, they've never been a fan. 
---
Fallout 3 is the only game that portrayed them like benevolent superheroes.
---
I think 76 can have more leeway with this since the Brotherhood hasn't yet become an isolationist tech  cult and many members probably still identify as American soldiers more than they do what the BOS will eventually become.
---
AGH, IVE FINALLY FOUND YOU! CONGRATULATIONS!!!! YOU ARE THE GRAND PRIZE WINNER OF THE APPALACHIAN SWEEPSTAKES!
---
People keep talking about how valuable screws are, that was before this event, now they are clearly pretty easy to get. After running it a bunch I don’t think I’ll ever need to loot screws again
---
Each game cell (area) outside of the forest spawns enemies based on the first person to enter it. So your situation is that like probably a level 100+ ran through the area before you and spawned way higher enemies.
---
If you're in an area like the savage divide or something, and all enemies are way higher level then you, log out and back in to get appropriate spawns.
---
It's not worth it to fight significantly higher enemies.
---
It's annoying for sure, but its worth doing. It should solve alot of your issues.
---
[Here's the rewards for season 2.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons) There's almost nothing I would ever consider using.
---
The only locks worth picking are level 3s and even then its trash a lot
---
I’ve made it a point to just drink it for fun every now and then and see where it takes me
---
You can run up to the chest though and grab like 16 ore that will start to weigh you down after a bunch of runs until you dump it all on the ground.
---
Such a great reward for running all the way up there!!  Really wanted some ore that I need to smelt myself using another resource!!
---
I always felt like this was one of the angles people were missing.
---
Combined with the recent changes, seems more then reasonable now.
---
Here's a radium rifle skin someone modded in FO4. I ported it over to FO76. It use's textures already in the game.

 Would be curious to learn more about Armor Ace.
---
The Sinister Socialist strikes from the shadow!
---
Oh thank you! Honestly it doesn't look that bad, some of the rewards look even better than season 1. Scratch those nukashines and basic repair kits, the cosmetics look nice.
---
Why, because they have different tastes in games..?
---
Friends roast each other all the time.
---
And this game is absolutely questionable.
---
I enjoy playing it, but the quality of service is quite pathetic compared to other games.

Comrade collectron it  is then

My life is so dull that sometimes on a Tuesday afternoon while toiling away at work I think "o0o0o0 I wonder what new stuff is on this week"...... I like the surprise....It's not much but it's something.
---
I seem to find them around Watoga fairly commonly. It’s been a long while since I grudgingly got rid of my collection of armor sets. Will be nice to display my remaining two.
---
Make sure you try in top of the school and the vertipads.
---
Can't wear a backpack with power armor in 76.
---
Try checking all the brotherhood forward stations in the cranberry bog
---
The Blood Eagles didn't take the Vaccination, so they keep getting infected!
---
You can often find some in the bunker where people fight the Queen and the nearby BOS outpost quite often.
---
I suspect you’ve ventured outside the Forest. If so, that’s too soon unless you like the struggle.
---
Thanks I’ve got the healing music from the game boy games stuck in my head now 😅
---
Nope. I really don’t care. Everything in the game never ever runs out. Getting radaway or caps or whatever makes literally no difference to me. 
---
The stuff in this game is overly abundant and infinite. 
---
And not real.
---
I describe the rifles as 
---
Combat &lt; Assault &lt; Handmade
---
The assault rifle has lower base damage then the combat but the accuracy and rate of fire more then make up for it (particularly for controller) and the handmade combines the solid stats of the Assault with higher base damage then the Combat. But in my opinion more important then that is getting a rifle with good legendary effects.
---
I can't see it very well but from what I can see it's actually quite nice
---
I would like a 3d preview, as some of the images they use in the shop are terrible or don't show the whole thing, like the SS PA camo skin this week is just one close up image of head and some of the chest.
---
The Scorched in nuke zones are a good source of Flux materials. Hope they stay.
---
I just hope that we get some choices regarding them. If they are Maxson style brotherhood and I can't actively try to kill them then what is the point of this even being a fallout game? The faction "sides" you take in this game are a joke. Mean nothing.
---
My mind immediately goes to Ammo factory. It's the one utility legendary that grabs my attention.
---
It's really easy to blow through materials to craft heavy ammo in this game.
---
I've run 35 times, and not gotten a single plan from it yet.
---
Got that mask once though.
---
Tip: if the cave is empty and you’re too stealthy to trigger the appearance, shoot any explosive weapon at the nest.
---
Stay in the forest region and dabble in the ash heap and toxic valley for a bit. Get a good feel for what's what. You don't wanna have to respect later.
---
I’d have to have the steam version to run mods huh :(. I have the Xbox game pass version
---
I mostly agree, but I love the free keycards. I launch a lot of nukes, less time hunting cargobots is very welcome to me. Damn things teleport in the opposite direction you try to head them off in so much, and half the time they flip on afterburners and yeet out of effective weapon range if you don't drop them instantly.
---
I think it would be nice if the filler spaces had more valuable things, like less common chems such as Overdrive or RadShield. Maybe random serums for the 90-99 filler ranks? Nothing in the filler ranks will ever be worth atoms.
---
It's part of one of modus' quests to figure out cracking the nuke codes.
---
I'm not sure about Game Pass, is it installed locally?
---
The Nuka Girl helmet is actually nicer, you can actually see through the glass on that!
---
Welcome to WV :)
---
Never fear, its like that for everyone.  You feel overpowered for some places, and underpowered (and overwhelmed) in others.
---
Some of the questlines quickly take you places lower levels will have a tough time surviving. 
---
At 22, try roaming between the forest and the Toxic valley (N by the alligator).  Follow the overseers questline.  It will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.
---
Work on the Mysteries, firebreathers, and respondrs questlines.  Join the BoS (recruitment blues quest at camp McClintock)
---
Do events like collision course and back on the beat in morgantown.  Path to Enlightment at the lighthouse is another good one. 
---
At 30, head S to the ash heap.  Start the Miner Miracles quest at the mining HQ neat the 3 leg towers.
---
At 40, the center strip, adn at 45-50, the east side of the map.
---
If you are pursuing a quest that takes you into the center (savage Divide), and its too difficult, nothing wrong with back burner-ing that quest and waiting until you are a higher level.
---
Loot dead enemies for ammo.  The overseers house usually has a bunch of 45 in the garage.  Or try melee weapons.  A machete and a fire axe were my friends when I was sub-level 20.  Then I found a vampire machete....
---
Ohhh I did go down there then. Probably just once and not since. Ill check it out
---
Look bud I went far and wide to find this bog roll for you, it's worth big bucks mate I've seen it selling for thousands in Peeps vendors.......now give legacy cheap skate.
---
Yeah it is
---
That would fuck up most of the main questline tho
---
Gauss Shotguns can one-shot most things. When they work.
---
This happened to me, had a camp in ash heap, never was bothered by anything, fun fight with them though!
---
make your build and weapon work together. One time I ran into a level 112 who had a bloodied explosive handmade that was doing like 84 pip boy damage. I modded it and helped him move some perk cards and use a couple level ups and it went up to 264 pip boy damage. Having a build and weapon that work together makes a big difference.
---
But but but, lord Todd says this obviously isn’t the old Gamebryo engine. Are you telling me Lord Todd lies??? 😂😂😂
---
Only games that are better at service that I can think off at services is, cod, battlefield (barely), fortnite, destiny 2 and I can't think of others
---
Also can we put them in small balls and make them fight other monsters?
---
I think that would be pretty cool.
---
But we want to farm screws!
---
Lol for sure!
---
You can totally be Ally rep for both. Have been for months. Best of both worlds.
---
You donut what he means is that he is looking for a friend To play with.
---
I'm sorry for your loss.
---
Glad it was able to cheer you up! Little things like that can make someone's day. :)
---
Any event or quest, but it's an absurdly low chance (0.02%). Still, the Savage Divide is the best region to get it since you're guaranteed to get everything in the pool.
---
Reminder to anyone that gets them: don't sell them for caps, they're all arguably worth more than the 30K cap limit. You're better off trading them directly for other rare items/weapons you're interested in. At the very least, do a price check in a trading community before any trade.
---
Not like real life at all...
---
Bugged I think they won't snap to my hubris wall paper on brick walls, and that was about a week ago hope they fix it soon I bought that staff skin to display in my shop.... but was foiled by the display .
---
If it's installed on your computer you can run the mods, just adjust all instructions to match your install location. You'll want the companion mod SFE with it. If for some reason you can't get it to work with Game Pass you'll want to switch to Steam or the Bethesda launcher version. I personally could not play again if I didn't have this mod, it makes a huge difference.
---
do you only have the one collectron? each collectron style (BOS, Regular, Raider, etc.) has it's own collection routine that you can select in that screen. If you only have the one, then only one will appear.
---
edit: nvm I see that you used the raider one in a previous comment
---
Forward Station Alpha too...
---
Awesome man I’ll have to try it for sure!
---
That seems most likely. I’ll check if it’s still there when I get back on later
---
The Unyielding set is optimised for bloodied builds...they are the ones that will benefit the most of this set. Now if you wanna run your junkie build or 2 shots explosive, as exemple, at low health. 
---
Fine...pointless tho.
---
And i repeat ! With the season passes and The Legendary perk card grind that is about to join the game. There's no point to play with a Bolstering set for a Bloodied build. Now if you are a player who dont care about that..Great...but still...Unyielding Bloodied build will still be the meta in the future because they offer the best optimisation to face an xp grind.
---
That's my actual point dude...
---
That's my point...now it you wanna grind your Legendary perk cards with a low health Junkie build. Np !
---
Oh, absolutely. Even non legendary auto grenade launchers are a ton of fun. Good luck looting the corpses, though!
---
It is because you are special :)
---
Actually I believe this is a bug that bethesda is looking into. I am not sure what will be the outcome of the bug: whether or not they will let you keep the atoms. Who knows?
---
another tip: at your level a hunting rifle with a silencer on it will perform very well if you remember to crouch before enemies see you. sneak damage is double, headshots are also double. try using sneak headshots, level 1 concentrated fire under perception allows you to use VATS to target heads. Not a VATS user and scope too shaky? Try to get a stabilized mod on your arm armor.
---
I had a camp that the cargo bot seemed to fly over regularly, would also leave the sbq fight and offer who ever launched the nuke another keycard, either to launch again or as thanks
---
Excellent job!
---
Oh. Missed opportunity on Bethesda's part, as it is Appalachia. Thanks for the answer!
---
What you really want are the part plans. Always do Distant Thunder this alone awards T-60 part plans.
---
Don't worry.
---
Us Slugger guys are here for all your melee kill needs.
---
Just aim and we'll take care of the rest, boss.
---
Secret Service is Heavy!
---
Yeah, not like Bethesda has ever done a story about a sub faction of the Brotherhood going against the insular doctrine of the organization to help people, resulting in a divide between the two groups.
---
And it's not like the Brotherhood's previous story in 76 was about ideological differences between Maxson wanting to help people and his followers slowly becoming more isolationist and mistrusting of outsiders. Right?
---
The only way they work in my camp is at a real stupid angle to the wall and way too far out in the room, I pissed about with them for atleast 20 mins before admitting defeat.
---
Once it tips it really tips in your favor. Just keep on going.
---
Yep it was originally from Fallout 4, but I had assumed it would also be in Fallout 76 due to the agricultural setting. Missed opportunity!
---
Nope. I had my camp on the elevated rail near defiance and logged out there. When I logged back in I fell to my death.
---
God, Ward is awful. Especially after Bethesda "fix" to prevent the gold bug. So sometimes you have to listen to him drone on multiple times. 💀
---
If anything we might see some resurgence of them, a mutated stronger form. Easier to repurpose assets than create new ones. We met the queen yes? Wheres the KING?
---
When Bethesda cant even make the only part of the game they care about work properly...
---
Good, it's about damn time! Bring on the downvotes, I already know each of them is coming from a dirty mutant that turned in their humanity willingly and embraced those abominable serums created via unethical human experimentation!
---
I don't even play warframe anymore, but I keep having to make comparisons in my head of "oh hey, warframe did this system much better" while playing this game. Just in general so many of their decisions feel like I'm playing a f2p mobile game, but it's a fully paid game with an optional monthly subscription on top. Not a cheap one either
---
Everyone in Fallout 4 was extremely skeptical of the Brotherhood. Honestly, what are you talking about?
---
Isn’t there some Jurassic park style lore explaining why they are female? I thought I remember something...
---
I should probably slot cola nut back into my build. Whiskey gives the same +6 str with the same alcohol buff card, but I've heard that the buff from Nuka Dark lasts a lot longer.
---
T60 plans are usually buried around higher level areas learn t60 plans with maps
---
I usually glaze over lore, so if so I probably missed it.
---
Mine has only gotten scrap, but I've been told by people that it's supposed to have two options, one for scrap and the other for ammo.
---
Maxson's ideology is Lyons's ideology, though. He tells Taggerdy that she needs to trust civilians, because everything they do is supposed to be for them in the end.
---
The original goal of preserving technology was to use it responsibly for the good of everyone.
---
Usually you post the pics to Imgur, then you link them to the reddit post.
---
there's factually more to the game than just exp grind. even with the upcoming legendary perk system. making a build geared towards int just so you can maximize your exp gain is stupid to say the least.
---
not to mention, there will always be a meta. what if they switched the requirement from having low health to having no resistances, essentially turning unyielding into a berserker build? you'd just complain about berserker instead?
---
picking the int bonus from unyielding of all things is a very, very strange hill to die on.
---
you also didn't address the 19% health requirement. bloodied builds essentially have to sneak or wear PA, which negates the bonuses from unyielding.
---
true
---
This is a neat idea, You have my sword.
---
As a side comment, during meat week, my CAMP happened to be next to a primal cut event. So it always felt like it was a primal event happening at my CAMP. After the event, people would go to my CAMP to use crafting stations and such in order to break down their loot. It was actually pretty neat to have that happen.
---
I used to do the bridge one solo , but now I sit on top on the centre turret type structure to spawn as much as possible and rain hell from up there with my TSE [50.cal](https://50.cal) "DADADADADADADADAD DIE MOFOS HAHAHAHAHAHHA DAAAADADADADA" always fun and very relaxing :P
---
Doesn't work when you're running unyielding sadly. I can carry way more carry weight than my PA could carry but I'm as frail as a leaf. Still have my PA for nuke zones though. I just have to live with being perpetually over-encumbered when going through one.
---
The enclave created the giant nuclear bat monster and believes that everyone that isn't in the enclave is a mutant. Oh, and they kill all mutants.
---
I don't get why she would do that if she was a Lyons in spirit. Maxson is of the opinion that the Brotherhood needs to trust and work with civilians to help them, which he had arguments with Taggerdy over.
---
Supposedly like 3 hours or 3.5 hours.  Think it might also give +9 str but I haven’t tested it.  Hoping to be able to tonight
---
Mine has only gathered scrap so far, is this the same for everyone else? It seems to have the same scrap pool as the base collection, if that's the case it's saved me 500 atoms at least.
---
If you stand far enough away from the robot vendors when you are trading, they will not make noise.
---
I respectfully disagree with the Nuclear keycards being a part of the event rewards. I think it would encourage higher level players who normally wouldn’t launch nukes to actually go out and launch them. But yeah I agree with nukashine and meds being poor rewards.
---
Dude you can't even nuke the settlers into oblivion
---
My bad, then.
---
&gt; And yet one of the most popular games of all time is eityher considered to be WoW
---
Pfft. No. World of Warcraft only had twelve million players at peak. MMOs are a minority at best.
---
&gt;  or GTA
---
GTA's limitation of 30 people per instance means it fails to deliver on the core concept of MMOs. It's not "massively multiplayer". It's simply "multiplayer".
---
Sure, but then they didn't do... anything
---
What's cool is in Patch 22, all megasloths will now have a white health bar, to signify it's peaceful :)
---
I'm still waiting for the skull and crossbones back packed that was data mined the week the game came out.
---
76 is an amazing game.  But the quality control just isn't there.
---
Yes i know right! They look dope.
---
Maybe they could be worn with and without power armor? Just like you could in Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas.
---
Only 2 issues with this post:
---
1) Unless it was changed just recently, you need to lock the console and container separately.
---
2) You can store the collectron and build any version without needing to lose materials via scraping.
---
I meant not having something like a hardened receiver. For the most part, I don’t see prime ammunition as worthwhile except for people who play constantly.
---
Eh so many weapons between all the games its hard to.keep track
---
apparently bethesda is changing the mega sloth into a neutral creature. it will no longer attack on sight and only fight if hurt first
---
Yes! I actually feel in love with them and have took loads of photos for my loading screens. Hands down the best
---
or at least make them leave it when a player activates it's use.
---
I hope so they’re amazing man. I can’t find a low enough level one to tame
---
That's exactly what I was thinking about! It was crazy, you'd see 10 people at a camp after the event. I thought that was such a cool thing to see.
---
But aren't the engines used over and over? Like Skyrim, fallout 4 and 76 have the same. I'm not any expert but I seem to recall unreal engine and unity out there, too.
---
Don't you dare tell me there are people out there making games like they are coding turbo tax or some stupid website. That would break my heart.
---
They just don't spawn for me though is what I'm saying lol. If that was what is happening I'd still be able to find the ghouls especially when I go there solo. But it's always the one ghoul in the same spot and I kill him and enjoy my meditation in peace
---
When in building mode and looking at a door, or any lockable object, you will get a prompt at the bottom of your screen for the proper button/key to use.
---
Yooooooooooh....the int is an extra in these builds ! Wtf you don't understand !? A bloodied sneaky sniper, a bloodied sneaky commando, a bloodied shotgun build and a bloodied melee build doesn't take the Unyielding set for the int but for the +15 strenght, agility or luck !
---
The extra intelligence is a bonus that other builds outside bloodied can't benifit...if they wanna add some xp buffs....it makes it even better. There's no point to give up these massive bonus stats for Sneaky bloodied snipers, commando and melee builds.
---
Alright...good bye !
---
In case you haven't seen any of the other posts, it looks like there's an issue with Bethesdas servers and new/renewing FO1st subscriptions might not be going through as there's an atoms bug.
---
In a related note, what’s a fair price for maps at my camp? I generally sell for a cap since I have no interest in the rewards but figure I could charge more whenever I’m low
---
yeah ive got most of em besides faschnacht i think
---
If you’re shootings bullets eventually you’ll want to try automatic weapons. Once that becomes a reality the gun becomes another mouth to feed. Lead is to make the bullets. Acid is used to smelt lead ore into lead to make bullets. Finding lead is fine for a few bullets but if you go through a lot then ore is the way to go since it’s something like, ore = 5 scrap and if you mine Lucky Hole it’s an easy 200 a 400 pieces of ore which is lots of lead for ammo (plus ammo Smith perk plus super duper is a good way to make $$$$)Which now as I’m talking it through, goddamn did I go through a lot to be able to make lots of ammo. 
---
I also do a lot of bulk ammo manufacturing for vending since I’ve come to realize no one gives a shit about buying non legendary weapons, plans or anything else really. Ammo sells itself.
---
Same. I really tried with The Legendary Run and hit 100 over 2 weeks ago. I have no wish to do so with this season. Don't care at all for the Communist paints or the Armor Ace power armor skin. It's not worth my time at this point.
---
Upcoming power armor stand??? We are going to be able to display suits?
---
That was long after the events of Fallout 1 though. As the NCR didn't exist until just before the events of Fallout 2!
---
I feel ya.
---
I just found out a couple of hours ago that a good friend of mine died last night, and I'm 7000km away so won't be able to say goodbye.
---
Take care, life's too short.
---
Also you owe money for winning.... fml
---
I sit in the rooms with the doors open that you spawn in via fast traveling to the event, after I kill the first group that spawn at the bridge speaker and get my easy legendary
---
How many perk coins do you get perk rank for the cards you scrap? At first it was only 1 coin for each perk card rank. I think I read somewhere they had raised it to two coins per rank. Sorry, but that still sounds awful to me.
---
IMO the coin system has always been  the most repellent part of the legendary perks. I mean I am glad that they improved on the perks themselves,  but I don't want to grind for more than 1,000 levels just to fully level up all of them.
---
For me, that is and always has been the worst part about this system, not the perks themselves.
---
As far as I am concerned, improving the perks without improving the coin grind is failing to fix the most broken aspect of the system.
---
That quest/content related to that suite was cut from the game as it was PvP-oriented and they refocused on their PvE-stuff. The PvP-event in the north of the map was also cut since some updates ago.
---
LOL this is so unfortunate but hilarious xD
---
One chameleon piece is really useful.  After that I find AP refresh to be the best.  I am always running from one position to another and jumping on top or behind things for cover though.   
---
 If you prefer staying in one place and you get hit a lot then maybe Sentinel would be better.  Enemy specific armour can be useful in the appropriate situations like Troubleshooters for robots but you will run out of stash space if you try to get a set for everything.
---
It was cut before Wild Appalachia I believe
---
Imagine getting all pressed on a simple miscommunication
---
It's should only be things you could buy with atoms/bullion or atom rewards. Stuff you can get/craft in game shouldn't be a reward.
---
Its pretty cool getting rewards for looking at my phone for a few minutes I guess but I wish the ghouls would come so I could get better xp from it lol. I've done it close to ten times, usually solo and just get one little ghoul and once he's dead there's nothing. The scorched are still inside the buildings but no ghouls and the scorched don't aggro unless I go inside. Maybe they just like me and don't wanna fight idk lmao
---
I'm sorry.lmao.i was so excited when I got a bloodied one with faster fire rate.hell no i wish it was like the junk cannon in fo4..blowing shit up with teddy bears.maybe I'm thinking the wrong gun from fo4
---
The data mining implied ammo, so most likely its just glitched!
---
It's even reality! It collects the same stuff we need for the challenges
---
With ACP i no longer have to murder them for screws
---
I did but didn't work, I already submitted a ticket tho and heard back from them
---
What should i level up for them?
---
Yes but most of the confusion is the drop list for this collection seems to be identical to the normal scavenger, as since activating it, the new one only gathers scrap!
---
Skill lol
---
But mostly just enemies that i can survive a battle with
---
I just want my PA leg to open up and store my laser pistol - is this too much to ask? For real though, I really do.
---
And I want an articulating arm for my mini gun - like the movie Aliens.
---
Should add what system!
---
I fell for that once...lost a b ex fmswa handmade we both requested  a item and like a klutz I zero my handmade that dude vanished into thin air..along with my will to do 1 on 1 trades
---
using buttressed mod, im assuming its sturdy. although i believe it doesnt technically have a category assigned to it yet. not sure though.
---
Instructions unclear. Bought Quad Salvaged Assaultron Head meme for 5k. Spend 30 seconds charging it, fire at ghoul, miss
---
Charge it again, fire at ghoul, hit, show 2000 damage, ghoul regenerates all health
---
Would buy meme trash again.
---
Legendary perk that removes blackout would make them awesome for melee users
---
Well every mission past the first five minutes kinda forces me to leave the forest
---
D: no not even for screws kill the wendigos and giddy up butter cups
---
Im so dumb im on ps4.
---
Ehh nuclear keycards arn't as bad.
---
I have issues shooting down the drone, but that is becuase im a melee build with no real ranged options. I only own one long range Gun and thats a 2* ultracite gatling laser. I use that for SBQ.
---
PvP player here to answer your question Ya vats doesn’t work 
---
all of us PvP players have to free aim In actual combat 
---
it’s a crutch anyway 
---
the less you can use vats in a fight the smoother it will go 
---
it’s all in your build and reaction time plus fat mans don’t work there is a PvP damage cap of 110 
---
so take that then minus dence which most of us rock 
---
fire proof 
---
iron clad 
---
doggy 
---
serendipity 
---
And usually the highest damage resistance armor and you might get 20 - 60 per hit that’s why everybody who PVP’s uses a full auto faster fire rate with as much armor penetration as possible 
---
it’s playing the numbers 
---
if you don’t play the numbers you’re always going to lose your gamble 
---
I got into PVP in this game because I got bored of the rest 
---
NPC‘s are predictable 
---
the grind is boring 
---
other players on the other hand unpredictable and entertaining and before anybody says go to nuclear winter there’s nothing to win pass level 100 
---
and I’ve won it so there’s no point in me going to nuclear winter
---
Things craftable at a bench then.  
---
Call it whatever you need to in order to ask for better things. you know what I mean.
---
We're still doing this?
---
Only time i had problem that fixed it for me , is bullshit not being able to use something you have paid for .  And i bet when they do fix it for you it will still have the day you made payment as the start of month instead of when you were able to use it
---
Fireworks run out. Wouldn’t you rather those?
---
And mods managed to add it in
---
How much Agi do you end up with while running Unyielding?  I run Bloodied and do not have a single piece of that, my Agi is usually around 24 with all buffs.  The only time I am seen is if I stay in one place too long or on the ground in a molerat area.
---
When I was like level 10 I went to someone's camp and drank from the punchbowl and literally just started tripping like I was on acid until I blacked out and then woke up on a cliff with three tnt plungers and when I pressed them the skeletons on these little launchpads were flung from the cliff into oblivion. It was golden and probably one of my favorite experiences in this game, so don't feel bad and give the noobies nukashine and let them experience it's holy greatness
---
Axolotl,  they are a mistake.
---
That would be sick
---
I wish i could melee, i had a chinese officer sword at full durability and after like 1 encounter it broke and i died because i was out of ammo because ammo doesn't seem to drop in large enough amounts to actually mean anything, even for (albiet low level) super mutant/scorched settlements
---
Go for it, I havent spent them anyway because I figured it wasn’t right, they can deduct all their atoms back
---
Press x/a/enter, it'll move you on to the selection screen!
---
Can’t disagree but it’s the nature of the beast right now in many games not just this one so make sure you call them all out
---
Are you on xbox?I'll trade you a decent gun for 1 of the masks I also have the colossus plushy I think
---
The current assault rifle disappoints me. Why would you use 5.56 ammo as a military round when body armor is a thing? As full auto the ammo capacity is way too low and the individual rounds do not pack enough punch. 
---
Also what's with the stupid liquid cooled water jacket looking thing around the barrel? It looks like somebody yanked a Maxim gun off its now and put a silly looking stock and handle on it. 
---
Actually, give us a Maxim gun, belt-fed 30'06, and usable in Power armor only
---
What does it look like?
---
#*NUKASHINE*
---
you're still under the impression that making a build around int, *just* for the exp bonus, is a valid strategy that should be catered to and accounted for when balancing the game.
---
it's not.
---
that's a very odd build choice. mainly because, like you yourself said, the special bonuses are an **extra**. they're not the main focus of the build. and you know what that means? that any build can make use of it, even if only temporarily. what in the world is stopping a junkie's build from equipping 5 unyielding pieces, getting irradiated and farming exp? nothing.
---
it's surreal that you just disproved your own point yet chose to double down on it.
---
&gt;There's no point to give up these massive bonus stats
---
a *lot* of people dislike playing at 19% health. I know this may come as a shock to you, but not everyone prioritizes exp gain.
---
**I also hope that you're aware the nerf is affecting exp gains from int as well**. so in 11 days this conversation will be moot.
---
Cheers :)
---
Sorry ps4
---
This was done before for Elder Scrolls (One Tamriel) and it destroyed that game for months and since most of my friends and guild mates quit, eventually so did I. So... don't know how it has changed since instituted. 
---
My experience wasn't pleasant, areas that previously were easy to traverse due to their low level, became this race for your life from area to area. Those lvl1wolves were no longer lvl1. Everything matched your level.
---
But that might work in FO76, oh wait they are also nerfing damage?!
---
Wish us luck!
---
You know why these replaced the fireworks? Bethesda couldn’t fix the fire rate bug.
---
Honestly, instead of these, I’d rather see extra bullion, cap and scrip rewards.
---
And power fists!
---
Any idea where to get a good scope/silencer attachment? Or maybe even a good way to get .308 ammo?
---
Or use our terminals to play holotape games together
---
Straight up wouldn’t bat an eye, sold.
---
I’ve thought those assholes were worthless ever since Fallout 1. Never understood their popularity.
---
That's more effective on bloody builds. If you hit my junkie's build enough times, maybe? But I also know how to spam radaways.
---
This debate over the BoS being good or bad should be resolved in the simplest way possible. They were founded by the remnants of the US Army, that alone should be the only clue as to what their morality is. They are the wasteland equivalent of the imperialistic force that invaded half the world in pursuit of fulfilling their own interests and needs. Of course they will spin it as being a force for the greater good, but as we all know they only help others to benefit themselves in the end and will use propaganda to justify their actions. I was originally swayed by Roger Maxon's honeyed words about justice and helping others, but it didn't take long to realize it's all bull just to make their actions appear better than the government's, when in reality they are two sides of the same coin.
---
The only faction working for the betterment of Appalachia is the settler faction in foundation as they are working to make the world better for all who inhabit it.
---
Fuck the BoS and the Enclave, they're both just means to an end and we don't owe them our loyalty.
---
Player ran casinos would be awesome
---
Please don't suggest that as that was what inspired the cardboard cut outs. Realistically a place like that would be too difficult for them to maintain with all the other problems and most likely cause more problems.
---
Prime ammo on all weapons, or just energy guns?
---
At this point yeah I’d agree with you that’s better then what’s there right now
---
What’s up
---
Wow this is a cool idea! Beth, please?
---
This is the best advice in this thread. Do what he says.
---
Only thing you can do is change your name to Hulk and start rampaging.
---
Why can't we just get a Nukashine robot, that walks around all drunk, and brings back random 3 star legendaries everyone once in awhile along with other things it brings back with it, and it should like disappear for a few hours now and again.
---
Egroegy is my psn. Be on in a half hour happy to help
---
I'm reporting all the downvoters for missing the clearly obvious joke
---
I also want the classic power fist. Maybe as a skin. Remember when Power Fists were literally the fist part if Power Armor hence the name. Not...whatever they are now. Construction knuckles or something? Also i would love classic power armor back one day.... when it was power armor not power suit.
---
Seems like more of a regular perk thing. 
---
You wouldn’t want to waste a precious slot on that
---
Actually, the legendary perk version is vastly superior to all stimpacks. They will also:
---
Fill food and water
---
Full health heal
---
Remove diseases (probably only one, but still)
---
And, for some reason, it doesn’t remove rads - excellent for bloodied players.
---
The endgame is really subtle, I think. For lack of variety in pve content, you kinda have to go out and make up your own routine of things to chip away at, which I like cuz then I feel I understand the game on a deeper lvl as well, researching item stats and perk efficacy and shit lol, and hitting daily caps limit, gold limit, script
---
not if you had two weapons though.
---
They also removed the extra resources, so you only get steel.
---
Hey Jax! :)
---
Make it a dump box
---
Grognak and the ruby sword from fallout 4 but on like a holo-arcade but each player controls a single character and can only enter the same locations and have the same combat encounters
---
99% chance to hit?  That’s a miss.
---
It's actually easier to kill him solo, the damage lags out with extra players.
---
yeah but it makes me feel better to nuke things. I nuked the settlers and looked that kid in the eyes when the bomb fell, it may not of killed them but I felt great.
---
In my testing I didn't find the faster fire rate effected the charge rate, or how fast you could spam it. I no longer have a FFR gauss Shotgun to test as it may have been silently fixed in the past few months.
---
My original plan was to max rep with both sides before I did the raid, but I ended up doing the raid before I maxed rep, and I did so intentionally. 
---
Got tired of doing events and getting script (i didnt need at the time) instead of t-notes.
---
Someone in their forum commented (paraphrased) that I was, in effect, wasting time, as the rep grind was just as time consuming as the bullion/ Tnote grind, so why not just get the Tnotes?
---
I was already high enough rep w/ settlers I had already bought the Chinese Stealth suit with caps.
---
  I’m a melee build, so the plasma caster has limited appeal, but SS armor.... thats another story.
---
 I did the raid a couple days later.
---
That was around the time Fashnacht ended. 
---
Rolled the last piece of 3\* WR (butressed) a few days ago.
---
And I still havent reached max rep with either side.
---
Now thats how to make a proposition. Show beth how to make money off it.
---
PvP works if you know how to use it
---
I would totally buy these.
---
Seems to be a pc only bug. Definitely looks like the game failing to read graphics driver.
---
Reading all the notes and entries of the dead factions: how hope and survival were materialized by different factions and ideas, how they clash or help with each other, how they fail to survive because they did not trust other factions. 
---
This is brilliant Fallout game.
---
Oh boy really? No wonder it was free then
---
I have a 2 shot one with -90% weight, fun just to have in my inventory tho the ammo is heavy...
---
I want that van, but I think it's not an actual object, like the Mr. Fuzzy or the party hat, you can't pick them up once they fell out of the display case.
---
Lucky for me I have 2 of those kidney things but no leather coat!
---
I use both on PS4, it doesn't cause that.
---
Yes I love shotguns and I take a small weapons bobble head before I see earl and I blast the spawns to pieces
---
I’m surprised you guys haven’t all ruined your phones laptops or desktops you’re using to answer these with all this crying and the moisture falling from your faces
---
Your shots will do damage to someone’s camp and bring it down to a one hit but you can’t actually destroy it. I believe it’s just a Visual bug
---
Pretty much all of them. I know, it means more ammo for your resources, but unless you make a point of continuously doing the two nuke bosses or farming flux, I don’t think the extra ammo is worth it.
---
It also prevents you from using normal ammo, which is normally extremely abundant for most weapon types, and if you are running low on prime ammo, you can’t easily switch back and forth without more flux, so I prefer my hardened receivers.
---
I just run in there and hear it pop out of the ground and lead it out of the cave and fight it from in a bus
---
There’s more crying about PVP than actually figuring out how to do it right
---
What platform are you on?
---
I tamed a cat at cranberry glade - he/she made it to my camp all the way in the mountains north of Toxic Valley. Hung around for a couple weeks then stopped showing up. Must've found a better gig. Been looking for a dog but haven't seen one.
---
No, I play a lot of PvP from rocket league and halo to call of duty and armello, this is not functioning pvp
---
I've crafted a Quad and a Bloodied Gauss Shotgun, both are great in there own way.
---
For that you want party boy, chug a whisky then a bufftats.
---
While that would be fun and interesting...
---
It would usurp poor Biv.
---
In all seriousness - that would be a fun one.
---
I saw a nearly complete set of T60 at Lost Home last night.  Also can spawn at pretty much any forward station in the bog.
---
Don't you get a set of T60 for completing the BOS questline?  I can't remember if it was the set of armor or just the plans.
---
Thought I’d do some outreach but there’s so much crying going on it’s hard for a lot of these guys to read my words of wisdom
---
I can't think of a more appropriate faction for a dude who gets his rocks off nuking kids.
---
The BoS is a power hungry tech hoarding group that despises anything non human. They have a superiority complex and will always view themselves as the top dog. If there is a way to fight them or nuke them or anything like that when they come, idk about you guys but you can count me in on doing anything in my power to bring hurt to the brotherhood. I've always disliked them in the series and they always show more reasons to keep disliking them, so I'm not surprised. But as you can tell I'm a little opinionated about the brotherhood lmao I'd like to hear what other people think of them if anyone has a better opinion of them than I do (and I know a lot of people probably do) maybe you can change my mind. Sorry for this long ass post too 😂
---
Yup, this still happens, send Bethesda a support ticket, they'll just lock it and ignore you but we need to keep up the pressure!
---
Not the same games
---
I have made a bunch I’m currently using a 3 star furious and I have a 3 star executioners with faster fire rate that I use for earl
---
That’s like comparing sports cars to off-road vehicles
---
Try to place your camp
---
I buy them for anything around or under 50 caps.
---
What I’m saying is I have 20 years of PvP and this game isn’t a good example of it, and I’m pretty sure the number of players and their investment reflects that
---
I think these are all the ones that help with weapons and armor durability. (Note that this is not a build guide its just showing you what's avalible) find ones you think you need and work towards them.

---
And what are your friends playing? Fornite? Hahahahahahahahaha. Apex ? Hahahahaha.
---
Good to know, I’ll keep them at a cap (I’ve got some plans like the nuka cola clock going for 3k so it’s only fair)
---
I’ve actually had trouble keeping my caps around 25k, started buying fixers almost as currency
---
The PVP community is huge you don’t hear from us because we adapt there’s a term called meta and whatever the meta is is whatever we change to we have nothing to complain about because we enjoy the challenge and again this is a completely different mechanics
---
Appreciate the detailed answers... thanks 😎👍🏼
---
I’m not into PvP ... if I get that itch ... I go to NW to get killed ... and spend most of that time being a Bush Wookie cause I suck at PvP 🤣🤣
---
It’s all in your build
---
I know, I watched a few videos of top players, and just didn’t understand the appeal given the limitations and bugs. PvP has to be pretty competitively neutral for it to work, looking up on a YouTube video how to create the one viable build isn’t a way to run a game
---
You work at Nuka-Cola?  Have some nuka cola my blood's in it?
---
Why just player romance? Now that I have Chicken Coop; I want a long questline that hooks up two of my lesbian chickens like Outer Worlds had.
---
My plan is to have 5 of the attribute ones max upgrades and the master infiltrator at 1 star, also max out the ammo crafting one and swap it with the infiltrator when needed.
---
We use very particular Builds absolutely no weight reduction unless it is dire aid that we use all damage output and all damage resistance no comfort perks at all most of us usually only have an extra carry capacity of 20 pounds but we can kill most people including each other it’s not that bad it’s not the real world you’re not losing anything except for some junk which would kind of be your fault for not stashing it anyone can do it Just got to get good
---
I always found SMs to be tough, regardless of what level I was.
---
I used a scoped hunting rifle or sniper rifle on theM if I could
---
IDK what your perks look like - both melee and heavy guns are benefitted by high STR. Most rifles are benefitted by high PER.
---
Scrapping weapons you loot can teach you mods, many of which will increase weapon damage.
---
Completing collision course at morgantown airport usually drops a good selection of weapons, ammo, and aid items.  Theres usually a hunting or sniper rifle,, a melee weapon, ammo, aid, and junk.
---
Plus looting the dead scorched....you can scrap to learn mods, or you can sell to the bot vendor at the train station to make caps.
---
Camden park?
---
Sadly Bethesda customer support doesn't care and won't do anything about it...
---
Alas not being only at reset isn't a guarantee you'll be safe either as it can also be triggered by crashing on loading a world regardless of time of day!
---
Just look up modern camp. They use the exact walls, the weird pillar/support method, the same doors. They all look the same and it’s kinda boring to be honest
---
Haha true. Sometimes our efforts go to waste and it's better to just watch foodbuilds be foodbuilds.
---
Stashed away forever.
---
I have the pirate costume and hat I new it was a little rare but had no idea people sell it for that much and I have only received one reclaimed mole miners mask
---
I kill him every time we cross paths.
---
Naw I don’t care about having them equipped to speed up rate of fire
---
I like it, but I also hate it cuz I can't hit a 'voice off' switch on their terminal.
---
Somethings you have to earn and do right What’s going to do you better in combat strong back or barbarian
---
I want a tunnel Snakes jacket
---
Only for unarmed builds, if you do then definitely that!
---
Lol i use my bf. I ain't ruining my good stuff
---
Surprised it let you move the station if it was considered in use. My power armor station did this and wouldn't let me move the station, wouldn't let me pick up my armor, or get back in my armor.
---
Lol, I use to be awesome at PvP ... like 20+ years ago ... well... I thought so 🤣🤣. Now my old brain can’t go as fast
---
Every gun that can support a suppressor should really have one, it helps with dps and survivability!
---
Some of the CAMP stuff looks nice. I want that Greenhouse, especially. But why are the other rewards so shite? I accumulate keycards like nothing just faffing about and have enough stims laying around to open a hospital. I don't need more. Give me some bullion or some scrip to speed up the gear grind or pick up rewards people may have missed last season. Hell, I'd settle for more caps or Bulk Ammo scrap, and those are worthless to half the playerbase anymore.
---
What does it collect? I really like my communist one, except that he just collects garbage. XD  the only worth things are some occasional stimpacks.
---
I meant target but yes lol
---
That sums up the experience of playing 76 honestly lol
---
I only did it because they made me grind for the gauss shotgun, I nuked the raiders because they were mean to me.
---
Hey just as an FYI.  There was another thread about someone who went through something similar and ended up with about 800k atoms. 
---
In the end bethesda ended up taking away ALL their atoms including the ones from their membership. 
---
You should either report it and count it as a loss or never touch it and just wait and see what they do.
---
Personally I like VATS better in this game. I never use actual aiming to shoot stuff I just press Q and clear the room lol. So satisfying when I chain crits together with gun-fu and grim reapers sprint.
---
I'm hoping we will get an eso type "overhaul" like that game got a few years after release but idk.
---
I pretty much exclusively use prime ammo, lol. Like you said, more ammo for your resources (provided you have a steady source of flux) plus most of it hits harder.
---
Yesss card games, dice, darts, pool, bowling even the hologames could work as two player. They should make a big update and add a casino somewhere then make plans for all these playable games.
---
The last hotfix broke sneak damage in group content.
---
Played on a public team today and while attempting to complete colossal problem my own public teammate (kra**e) crashed the game...SMH. Other players were using emotes to indicate frustration but it didn’t help. Had 1 frame per min seemed like. Some people rather get the XP than care about game crash. Just stop with the £€&lt;%in Tesla rifle!
---
We have the fo3 jukebox, but it would be cool to have a theme or set of old fallout camp stuff
---
Sorry, bro. I don't think they know how to do that.
---
OK, good. I thought I was going crazy
---
I have problems also I’m 40 + and I can’t keep up with Some Ac130 builds and nuka spammers I don’t get salty I stop after 3 of loosing go on open mic and say GGs
---
Wouldn’t the “faster fire” on the .44 essentially be useless though?
---
Aside from that, I also would like to see these changes. The ability of these weapons to be legendary wouldn’t completely mix up the meta all that much so why not.
---
You get a full set of ultracite pa at the end of the BOS questline.
---
Sorry man what’s done is done :(
---
This is awesome I have one myself but i never have any giant peas to shoot :(
---
I like killing them wit kindness
---
Never had any lag issues in that event myself on PS4, energy weapons or not. I do get lots of it wandering the wilderness or camp building since patch 21 though.
---
Just started doing this myself. When I realized you could use collectrons at workshops it was an Aha moment. Now I can use collectrons and not build junk extractors and save on the crafting materials. Unfortunately I bought my first collectron in the Atom Shop not knowing we were getting a free one . LOL.
---
Damn, that’s incredible.
---
Ah interesting.  And that’s probably why you can’t sell ammo to vendors. It would break a massive part of the economy.  Also explains why no one buys my spare plans, lol.  I’ll make sure I put some ammo for sale.  Are there any automatic .308 weapons because I have a ton of .308 ammo and the sniper rifle is the main weapon I use right now.
---
I would use bows... with an automatic mod 🤪
---
Im doin runs right now psn shaggie_D-rugs if you wanna join
---
Sent PM
---
Thanks dude haha and I wasted a lot of lead making them. I only made 50 but it was 50 too many
---
I've had a similar issue where random intractable objects in the game inherits the name of a random team mate!
---
I felt that way when I was a low level. Now I'm level 412 and I now wonder how there are players that are level 1000+.
---
the same as the normal scavenger collection it turns out.
---
I would use bows if they wasn’t so awkward to use.... legit Skyrim and any fallout 4 bow mod feels better and actually has iron sites unlike the crappy 76 bows
---
I did this during the Holiday Scorched event last year on my private world, with the Santatron. 
---
So... many... gifts.
---
Whitesprings Keycard
---
anybody else just showing up to collect the rewards
---
Honestly that wouldn’t be a bad idea for a mod for the crossbow.
---
Did you just told me that a Junkie build has no other choice to play low health if he wanna get extra xp !? Wow...
---
And wait wait, you are also telling me that Unyielding Bloodied build will benifit even more from an Unyielding armor set ?
---
My Bloodied sneaky commando and sniper are gonna have some fun ! Extra +15 perception, +15 agility and +15 luck...and even +15 intelligence. I'm gonna make more xp than anybody else. Don't worry i'll not forget to pop some more xp buffs. ✌
---
I haven’t gotten one rare outfit drop without trading for it. Feels bad man.
---
76 is nowhere near stable enough for PvP minigames to be enjoyable &amp; fair. Interesting idea though. Then you will always have trolls trying to muck everything up of course...for perspective sake...you can barely stay in a trade menu with another player let alone an entire poker game without it bugging and disconnecting. It would be a nightmare on the current game engine...
---
They collect different things. The free one only collects a few scrap items, but the scavenger one collects all the scrap items.
---
Wait till you hit 400. Between 400 and 500 progression slows way down. Im lvl 517 and it's getting so hard to get my lvl per day.
---
Or 2 free falling pieces. 0 fall damage. Its great.
---
